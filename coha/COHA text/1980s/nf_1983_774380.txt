Various points were assigned for tables , chair , desk , sofa , lamps , clocks , pottery , books , magazines , radio , telephone , as well as for taste , cleanliness , and good repair . By 1933 Chapin had honed down the list to 17 items . The possession and condition of these objects proved to accurately separate the destitute ( 0 ? 24 points ) from the blue collar ( 25 ? 99 ) , from the average middle class ( 100 ? 124 ) , from the upper middle class ( 125 ? 149 ) ? a hard pill to swallow , perhaps , for those who think that material possessions do not count . In 1933 they counted the most when they added up to an upper-middle-class 149 points . The problem with the Living-Room Status Scale was that social scientists soon realized changing fashions could make it obsolete . To remain accurate it " would have had to be constantly revised , " said sociologists Richard Coleman and Lee Rainwater recently . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , published in 1978 . Today most people have the same basic package of goods . Checking off the presence of certain items would n't be enough anymore . You 'd need to measure the subtle semiotics , the messages each item gives off . Is the bookcase from the unpainted furniture store or fine cabinetry ? Is the club chair covered in Naugahyde or genuine leather ? Now that even budget sofas come with a bunch of back cushions , you 'd have to give different scores for Dacron filling and pricey down . In fact , those who could accurately decipher the subtle differences would deserve status points themselves . " It is well known that objects tell a great deal about the social status of the owner , " if one can decipher the code , said French sociologist Jean Baudrillard . But rarely are rooms all of a piece . Some things denote " factual status , " while others tell of " level of aspirations , " or " fidelity to original class . " People play with the code of meanings , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in thier class dialect , " making it hard for anyone outside the same status group to interpret it . For those reasons the next generation of status accountants developed a new technique for doing status arithmetic in homes that could be described as , " Do n't send a fieldworker ? just ask a  | neighbor . " In the 1930s , social anthropologist W Lloyd Warner was working on Yankee City , the seminal study of status in Newburyport , Massachusetts , which became the touchstone for all subsequent status research . Warner defined status groups as " networds of equal rank . " It made sense to him , therefore , to use peer groups to do the social accounting . Better than outsiders , people in the community could evaluate those around them ? their memberships , friends , homes , living rooms ? and could convey those evaluations to researchers . Based on interviews within the community , Warner isolated six status levels in " Yankee City " : upper-upper , lower-upper , upper-middle , lower-middle , and upperlower , and lower-lower class . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function . For the two upper classes , said Warner , the house is " the very heart of the technical and symbolic apparatus necessary for maintenance of self-regard . " Their symbols express " the significance of their way of life " to outsiders but also remind the dwellers " of the superiority of their world . " Warner found that the upperupper class ( the old rich who could trace their ancestry back to the golden period around 1815 ) spent the smallest percentage of their income on home equipment , while the lower-upper class ( the new rich ) spent the largest percentage of their income . This supported his thesis that the lower-upper class went in for " conspicuous display " while the upper-upper class people were more " soberminded . " They could afford to be ? their inherited furnishings and paintings and their low rate of house-moving helped keep down material expenditures . Influenced by Chapin and Warner , Harvard 's James Davis in the 1950s asked Cambridge housewives to arrange photos of living rooms according to social status , something he found they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep them from doing living-room status arithmetic . Why did Davis choose the living room ? Because almost every family has a living room , he said , and since it is accessible to outsiders , " it is furnished from a social as well as an individual point of view . " He concluded that making status judgments from living rooms was " an institutionalized phenomenon , " that people had very clear perceptions of a status hierarchy , and that the judgments they made were about other individual 's economic worth although their judgments  | became less accurate the more removed they were socially from those they were judging . Obviously , people could n't be such accurate status-ticians if there were n't unwritten but agreed-upon star dards of living-room equipage that are conformed to at each level . In 1970 sociologists Edward Laumann and James House took living-room status testing a step further by correlating taste for specific styles of living-room decor with social milieu . After studying the backgrounds and attitudes of the upper class in the Detroit area , they found that those who chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sides of the social divide . The " traditionals " tended to be established , white , Anglo-Saxon Protestants . They set the standards for the middle class who followed in the WASPs ' traditional-style steps . The " moderns " were new rich , upwardly mobile non ? Anglo-Saxons , often Catholic , who were " making it " for the first time and did not socialize with the traditionals . Since the social contacts of the new rich did not give them the prestige they craved , they turned to conspicuous consumption , with taste as well as money . " The nouveaux riches , " said Laumann and House , " spurn the style of the traditional upper class in favor of newer fashions ... to establish their tastefulness " while " showing their disdain of the snobby ' traditionals . " This refuted something taken for granted since the turn of the century when Veblen in his send-up of leisure class " conspicuous consumption " asserted that the old elite set the standards while those beneath them emulate them . The old elite do set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , but not for the very new , very rich . Style preferences may come and go , hut what is constant is the challenging group 's need to differentiate itself from the already ensconced group . In the 1970s another team of researchers focused on life st yle as an indication of status . Housing is a major life-style expense that is closely indexed to income ; economists have hammered home for years that up to 25 percent of income was the proper amount to spend on rent , and most people complied by buying the most housing they could afford . Furniture is also indexed to income , it has been found . " There is a strong acceleration of furniture spending as income increases , " said one furniture industry analyst . Because of this , the house has come to be an index as well as a symbol of income level .  | Once you have the yardstick , you ca n't help using it . People judge other people by their standard of living , stated Coleman and Rainwater . In search of a status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all walks of life to place themselves on the status ladder vis-a-vis their neighbors . The result was yet another status ladder , this one with seven ranks in three classes ? Upper Americans : old rich , new rich , and moderately successful professionals and managers ; Middle Americans : comfortable and just getting along ; and Lower Americans : working poor and welfare poor . The task of pegging people was made easier , said the authors , because " Americans generally , regardless of class level , are almost continually judging each other as socially superior , inferior , or equal . " Coleman and Rainwater found that income is the most important component of general social standing while education is the most important cause . Since people are not privy to one another 's bank statements , hat basis do they use to make these judgments ? A major test of come is a person 's home . " It is questionable whether a family is regarded as a full participant in the good life , no matter what its come , if it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A suitable house , in this study , meant one with the proper number of rooms for each level of the social ladder . The respondents agreed , to be a comfortable Middle American you would have to own , not rent , " a single-family house with six regular rooms ( living room , dining room , kitchen , and three bedrooms ) plus one and a half baths . " To lead a good upper-class life , a house with a living room , dining room , and a family room plus three bedrooms is needed ; to lead a very good upper-class life , an eightroom house with a family recreation center is necessary ; and to be at the top of the upper class , a " super-luxurious " home , plus a second home , is a must . Certainly , other things count in status assessment ( cars , vacations , jobs , club memberships ) , but the more rooms one has , the more they count . You might think it would be impossible to play the living-room status game today when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The growth of single-person households , the in-creased divorce rate which often divides a family 's income in two , the decline in family size , the new culturally approved informality , added to the amazing plurality of decorating styles , all conspire to confuse living-room status mathematicians . With art directors dropping out of high-salaried jobs to become struggling painters , scions of the Rockefeller family going back to nature , and a big-bucks movie star like Jane Fonda keeping a low profile , today 's living room would seem to be the last place to find accurate clues to status . But the living-room status test lives ? requiring ever more complex categories to pigeonhole people and a sharper eye for status inconsistencies . Enter VALS , short for " Value and Lifestyle Program , " a market research project of SRI , the sometimes controversial Northern California think tank formerly known as the Stanford Research Institute . SRI maintains itself with fees in excess of $150 million per year from government , commerce , and industry . A long list of Fortune 500 companies each pays SRI $27,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately to consumers their beers , rent at cars , magazines , whiskey , and grandfather clocks . No consumer topology seems more exhaustive . VALS has sorted the 226 million Americans into 3 divisions and 9 categories . The term social status rarely appears in the reams of printed matter SRI generates on VALS . Yet the VALS hierarchy appears to be a jazzed-up version of the all-American status ladder ? with a heavy marketing orientation . An eclectic mix of ideas from previous studies in psychology and sociology , VALS stresses that people of similar economic level can have very different values , and it is the values that influence the life style . As any sanguine social status-tician would expect , the living room is one of the major places where people show their VALS . The VALS status ladder ( 3 divisions , 9 levels ) has a distinctly Northern California silhouette . It is shaped like an artichoke , the regional vegetable . According to VALS ' associate director , Gloria Esdale , people move up from one VALS stage to the next through a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regress because of insufficient funds to maintain a particular life style . SRI has prepared a number of reports projecting how people in different VALS levels can be expected to relate  | to certain categories of products and services . One of these studies is called " The Home . " It confirms that the American living room has n't lost its status symbolism yet . Here are some highlights of the VALS topology from the bottom up . All quotes are from " The Home . " In the stem of the VALS artichoke is the Need Driven group which includes Survivors and Sustainers . Survivors account for about 6 million households ? 1 percent of the total home furnishings market . Among the Survivors are the people Ms. magazine recently called the " Nouveau Poor " ? elderly widows and divorced women with many children . Survivors had incomes of under $4 , 200 in 1978 , the year of VALS ' statistical base ; they spent their money on essentials and " barehones furnishings . " Sustainers , 8 million households , younger and largely ethnic , accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These people live with a lot of secondhand furniture ? hand-me-downs . Sometimes they splurge on I'rincess phones . There are two avenues of upward mobility in the SRI status artichoke , the Inner Directed and the Outer Directed ( terms that SRI uses without apology to Harvard 's David Reisman , who coined almost identical terms and used them differently ) . To the left is the  | Outer Directed route , the traditional American way , which you climb from Belongers to Emulators to Achievers . Belongers are conventional , traditional , formal , sentimental , old-fashioned , and family-oriented . Not particularly affluent , they are society 's stabilizers , tending , like Archie Bunker , to prefer old values and traditional ways . The Belonger 's home , like Archie 's or the widower police sergeant 's on " Gim me a Break , " is a refuge and a haven , a symbol of belonging to the community and a particular way of life . Belongers " do n't like big parties for casual acquaintances , partly because of a fear of not being acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The living room is " the most important room " in a Belonger 's house , which is not likely to have a den or family room . The TV set is the focal point of the Belonger 's living room , which is accessorized with family photos , trophies , mementoes , handicrafts , plate collections , and symbols of patriotism . Often unsure of their judgment , Belongers tend to buy brand names or matched sets of furniture . They are not interested in making a personal statement with their decorating , preferring comfortable , no-hassle furnishings . Another 6 million American households are Emulators , including many blue-collar workers , blacks , and career women . They account for 11 percent of household furniture expenditures , nationally . " The Jeffersons " of TV fame , whose theme song is " Moving on up to the Big Time , " would seem to be Emulators . " Emulators are conspicuous consumers , materialistic , status conscious , on the leading edge of voguish fashions , show-offs ; they prefer overstatement and are very upwardly mobile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the group above them in the VALS scale . Emulators favor expensive-looking housing wit h the trappings of wealth ? pools , saunas , glamorous lobbies ; in furniture they 're " drawn to examples of ultra-modern " found in the magazines and images of Hollywood . " Not able to afford the origi nal they cut corners . . . not really seeing the difference . " Emulators begin decorating in the most public spaces . Thus the living room is the focus of their attention . They like to entertain and are good customers for souped-up video and stereo equipment . Style takes precedence over comfort or function . Clues to Emulators , at least in 1978 , were shag rugs , fur throws , crushed velvet , mirrored walls , expensive sound systems in the living room . Achievers ( 13 million households accounting for 36 percent a (  | all furnishings purchases ) are the high rollers : physicians , lawyers , stockbrokers , and corporate executives , some of them millionaires . Achievers are successful ? and eager to give evidence of that success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive , interested in efficiency and comfort , " and buy top-of-the-line luxury items . Their focus is on entertaining and self-exposure . Achievers supposedly live in fine old houses or architect-designed new ones ; they can afford to indulge their preferences for exclusive neighborhoods , multiacreage , privacy , security , tennis courts , pools , and greenhouses . In their living rooms , Achievers are on a first-name basis with Oriental rugs , pure silk , wool carpeting , art objects , collectibles , rare books , and timepieces . They entertain frequently and can dedicate one living room to guests because they usually have a den , family room , or bedsitting room where they watch TV . Having multiple living rooms seems to be one of the marks of an Achiever . Jacqueline Onassis 's hideaway in Martha 's Vineyard is said to have three living rooms ? a living room and a family room in the main house , and another living room in the guest house . But not everyone wants to move up the traditional way . The alternate upward mobility route is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Its ladder is on the right side of the VALS artichoke and also has 3 levels : I - Am- Me , Experiential , and Societally Conscious . Often children of Achievers and Emulators , Inner-Directed people are the fastest-growing consumer category . Numbering 12 million highly educated households in 1978 , VALS predicts they 'll be a not-to-be-sneezed-at 22 million by 1988 , and an important market for soaking tubs , hot tubs , whirlpools , and skylights . The least affluent are the I-Am-Me 's , mostly students . What they lack in income they make up for in style . They are young , zippy , exhibitionistic , narcissistic , dramatic , impulsive , and fiercely individualistic . I-Am-Me 's are supposedly better customers for bedrolls than for standard bedding . However , when they settle down and go to work , they move up economically to Experientials ( leaning toward parapsychology , yoga , and knock-down furniture ) or the more affluent Societally Conscious , in the company of , I presume , such people as Jane Fonda , Gloria Steinem , Governor Jerry Brown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directeds can be found leading lives of " voluntary simplicity " in the  | country , self-expression near college campuses , or creative renovation in lofts in changing industrial neighborhoods , using " honest , " durable materials . The living rooms of both the Experientials and the Societally Conscious are in strong contrast to those conspicuous consumption living rooms of Achievers . The Inner Directed 's living room may be an expanded kitchen with a solar greenhouse or other multipurpose room decorated with natural wood , exposed brick , floor cushions , beanbags , hammocks , tree-trunk tables , hand-woven fabrics , hanging plants , hand-thrown pottery , wood stoves , and $2,000 stereo component systems assembled after " much comparing of brands and prices . " The accompanying photographs in VALS ' " The Home " indicate a certain shagginess , from the fringe on the hand-loomed shawls to the hanging ferns and macrame plant holders . The constrasting portraits drawn by VALS , on the one hand , of the sleek , one-purpose Outer Directed living room , and , on the other , the shaggy , multipurpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , the VALS depictions were confirmed in a recent study of California homes by two anthropologists who found that the absence or presence of a clearly defined living room is the easiest way to separate a counterculture family from a conventional family . In a conventional home ( what VALS would call Outer Directed ) , the California study said , rooms have predictible functions . A living room is a living room . In a counterculture living room ( what VALS would call Inner Directed ) , functions overlap . Crowning SRI 's artichoke are the Integrateds ? 2 percent of the population . When someone who works at SRI wants to get on your good side they tell you you seem to be an Integrated . Integrateds are a cross between the top-scoring Achievers and the top-scoring Societally Conscious . Integrateds " have it all together , " said SRI 's Gloria Esdale . " They 're psychologically mature and comfortable with themselves ? like Einstein and Arnold Mitchell , " the VALS director . What happens when an Achiever is married to an Emulator ? Good question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingo . " Ideally , all household adults would belong to the same type and therefore agree on most elements of the home environment . " lint often that 's not the case . When the husband is an Achiever and wants to decorate for success and the wife is a Belonger who  | wants to decorate like her mom " homey , conservative , and family-oriented " there can be trouble . The solution , according to VALS ? The wife , to please her husband , " lets a decorator do the living room and dining room and does the other rooms in her own taste . " There 's the living room emphasis again ! What happens when the household moves up from Belonger to Emulator , or from Emulator to Achiever , or moves sideways from Achiever to Societally Conscious ? Do they bring along the furnishings that express the previous values and life style ? VALS has the answers to this one , too . The new home will contain a " mix of products , " or else there will be " sufficient desire " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude . " Yes , Virginia , they will redecorate . It 's not only that " rank must be marked . " It is also that new values must be made visible . And pent-up needs and desires that could not be afforded before will be satisfied . In order to belong to a group , you need the trappings of the group , the right stuff . To count , those things have to be visible . For most people , the living room is the handiest shorthand symbol of their status . But identity is made up of more than social status and is expressed in more areas of the home than in the living room . If you are asking yourself , Who am I ? , you have to consider your sex role , your stage in the life cycle , and your personality as well .  | THE DOORBELL WAS ringing . It was kaffeeklatsch time in a modest Long Island suburb , the hour when once upon a time the proverbial little woman was at home , making beds and softening fabric . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome Tognoli , a psychology professor at C. W Post College , was waiting for the oil burner repair people . His wife , an instructor at another college , had left earlier to teach a class . Tognoli and his wife had bought the house the previous year with the understanding that he would do the major share of maintenance and supervise the renovations until she finished her doctoral dissertation . And he really did n't mind . Until moments like this . As he went to answer the door , Tognoli recalled , he could hear one of the repairmen saying , " Here she comes now . " " They just assumed it would be a woman at home . I was in my running clothes , and , I must admit , I felt self-conscious , as if I were answering the door in my bathrobe . We had just vacuumed , so I asked the men to go around to the back door , but I felt fussy doing it . Then , while they were working I started washing the breakfast dishes and I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tognoli is no stranger to sex role issues . He teaches a course  | called Images of Home in Psychology and Literature . " In my course , " he said , " we talk about attitudes . One student told me that her father refused to go marketing because that 's for fags . " The problem men have doing things around the house , he explained , " is fear of being judged feminine ? which is intermingled with fear of being homosexual . " " The home is the core aspect of human experience , yet men seem to feel uncomfortable when relating to it , " he noted in a study of men 's attitudes toward their homes . Men have traditionally gone outside the house for their social activities . " Men typically do not invite men friends into the home to socialize unless done in the safety of women 's supervision , " and when they do invite men , " it is under a highly formalized context , " a gin game or a TV tribal ritual : watching the Superbowl , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the Election Night returns . Little wonder that the last thing many young bachelors are concerned about when they furnish is how many people they can seat at the dining table . " I 'm never going to entertain , " a typical , twenty-eight-year-old bachelor assured his decorator . A stool in the kitchen for breakfast was his idea of dining-room furniture . Not until he became engaged and his fiancee insisted , did he relent and order a table and chairs . In Barry Goldwater 's Washington , D.C. , condominium ( in which the doorbell chimes the Air Force song ) , the dining room is devoted to a ham radio station , and the pantry is a gun-making shop . His wife resides full-time in Arizona and Goldwater commutes between the two residences . For evidence that men living alone have different socializing patterns than women do , consider the gender segregation experiment conducted by John Ofrias and Tognoli . Two families that were good friends ( whom I 'll call the Allens and the Butlers ) split up temporarily and recomposed themselves according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another . For seven weeks , Mrs. Allen , thirty , Mrs. Butler , thirty-two , and her fourteen-year-old ( laughter , lived together in the Aliens ' suburban house , while the males , Mr. Allen , thirty , Mr. Butler , thirty-five , and his ten-yearold son , all lived in the Butlers ' house . Copious notes were taken , charts filled in , diaries kept , and friends and relatives interviewed . During the experiment , the two women had visitors on many occasions . However , Mr. Allen and Mr. Butler did n't have a single  | male guest ? not that they did n't invite any . But men who had been good friends refused to visit , and even seemed to avoid them . Why ? The cause was made clear in questionnaires filled out by some forty friends , relatives , and neighbors as part of the study . One of the Aliens ' neighbors , a man who had previously spent a lot of time with Mr. Allen and Mr. Butler but wanted nothing to do with them during the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experiment to find out their compatibility toward each other ? " " The home is perceived as female and as the seat of intimacy , " said Ofrias and Tognoli , " and for other men to socialize in it might suggest too close an association with femininity and intimacy ? qualities the male sex role dictates should be avoided at all costs . " In fact , what worried Mrs. Butler 's mother most about the experiment was that it might lead to homosexuality . Obviously , there are very real differences in attitude about home between men and women , but when it comes to gender and decorating , this is the Age of Denial . Even usually observant people take the Fifth if asked whether they notice any differences in the homes of men and women living alone . If men and women are created equal in decorating skills , how come no one cried foul at Starting Over ? There was certainly a ring of truth to that scenario when Jill Clayburgh moved into Burt Reynolds 's gloomy place with her quilts and her plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household inventory of 3,000 single persons ' living quarters to recognize the fact that men have been flexing a different set of muscles in the homemaking department ?

James Bond , with his souped-up electron , ics , is a more important decorating role model for males than James Beard , with his state-of-the-art kitchen , even though Beau d is gaining . Just because Paul Newman is marketing his own salad dressing does n't mean that men 's lives and role definitions have changed nearly as radically as women 's have in the last decade . Men ca n't be blamed for their nesting disabilities . Years of playing with dollhouses , toy kitchens , helping mother , taking  | " home ec , " and pursuing needlecraft hobbies have given women an edge .

As President Reagan said in a TV interview with Dan Rather , " Nancy tells me what color the drapes should be and I tell her what we 're doing about foreign policy . " In the world according to TV , a prime medium for teaching children the real facts of life , women get out of the house much less frequently than men do . In a recent study researchers analyzed the thirteen TV shows most popular with children , aged two to eleven , including " Mork and Mindy , " " Laverne and Shirley , " " Loveboat , " " Bugs Bunny , " " Chips , " " Eight Is Enough , " " Sesame Street , " and " Charlie 's Angels , " to see whether men or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inside , at home .

And on " Mork and Mindy , " Mork had an excuse for spending so much time in the house ? he came from another planet . Even Charlie 's audacious angels could not get out of the living room . On that show , the three female detectives got their orders from a disembodied Charlie who was heard but never seen . The males on the show were shown outside more than inside , while the three angels were seen inside almost twice as often as outside .

The Berbers , who are Moslems , have a series of maxims on the place of men and women that would probably inspire Phyllis Schlafly to praise Allah . The Berbers believe " Man is the lamp of the outside and woman the lamp of the inside . " For a Berber man , " the house is less of a place one goes into than a place one goes out of .

" Knocking the myth of " inevitable domesticity , " she explained that women started becoming housebound with the rise of agriculture in the Middle Ages . Although many women worked alongside their husbands in the fields , and a few , like Joan of Arc , even went to war , women generally stayed inside , while men went outside . A man without a woman to take care of his house lived like a beast , said one fifteenth-century preacher . He compared the bachelor 's bed to a ditch : It " was never shaken up and smoothed .. . the sheet was never changed until it fell apart from age . . . on the floor lie the rinds of melons . . . the platters he washes as little as he can .

With the exception of wealthy widows who had special status , women were not yet the consumers . It was the wife 's job to keep track of what was needed in the household , but it was up to the husband to do the purchasing . He was also the one who commissioned a house from an architect , and he was undoubtedly in charge of furnishing it . Men were still doing the purchasing in the eighteenth century ? a period when English and American gentlemen were vitally interested in the decoration of their houses , and in competition  | with one another to be the first to have the latest styles . Like his contemporaries , George Washington had a passion for china and even occupied himself with selecting ornaments for his table settings when he was president . In 1758 he wrote his china purchasing agent , saying , " Pray let it be neat and fashionable or send none .

" Men in those days were the tastemakers , and historians say they have no real evidence that upper-class eighteenth-century American women had much say in the decoration of their houses . It was not until the early nineteenth century that women became chained to the house . At this time , home and workplace , which had been synonymous , became separated as industrialization began to change the structure of society . Men went to work outside of the home , and women were left to care for the family and the house . In 1845 , when historic records show that a Vermont couple went to New York together to buy furniture ? considered an important clue ? the role realignment became evident . To women 's domestic duties had been added the responsibility for home furnishing .

The multitude of advice books churned out to teach women of the emerging middle class the ins and outs of homemaking and decorum , including not picking teeth at the table , as well as the duties of wifehood , show us that there was nothing innate about woman 's role . She was treated as if she were ignorant and incompetent . With the rise of eclecticism , there was much for women to learn and the educators treated them as if they were all inept . On top of that , there was a new stereotype which first appeared in the 1840s ? the frivolous woman who wanted to impress with her house . From then on , the housewife was continually accused of being extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got passed along from book to book like a  | torch in an unending relay race while a whole generation of women whose grandmothers had been self-sufficient ? spinning , weaving , making soap and quilts ? now had to be reeducated into the task of being good consumers . As household technology gradually liberated women from their overwhelming housekeeping and maintenance responsibilities , they were left with few outlets for their energies , and authority figures were looking for tasks to tie women down . " Our whole social fabric would be better for it . Too many women are dangerously idle , " said the Ladies ' Home Journal in 1911 . One task that could keep them busy besides motherhood and germ warfare , was homemaking-as-art-form . The recipes and the patterns for a cozier home marched forth , month after month , and still do . Women 's magazines taught kitchen organization , the so-called psychology of color , decoupage , china painting , needlework , do-it-yourself , and space planning . If there was any doubt about the fitness of women for the interior realm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural habitat . Based on results of free-play experiments with children , Erik Erikson , the noted psychiatrist , said in 1963 that women were innately inner-oriented and men innately outeroriented . Girls , he observed , routinely built interior scenes filled with people and animals and furniture , while boys put their people and animals outside and built elaborate structures with cannons and turrets . As it is with concepts that fit a society 's prejudices , Erikson 's theory took on a life of its own . He was n't credited when the idea surfaced , as if written in stone , in the Washington Star in 1979 . " Spatial relationships are anathema to most women , " wrote architect John R. Miller . " The fields of architecture and engineering are open to women , but these areas are dominated by men . " No mention of the fact that some of the major architecture schools , founded in the last quarter of the nineteenth century , would not even admit women until around 1910 . Miller was puzzled " at the success with form that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female a characteristic way of structuring the world  | that is different from the male ? " asked Yi-Fu Tuan . He was n't the only one who wanted an answer . It was a question vital to the women 's movement . Is woman 's place inside and man 's outside engraved in their respective DNA , or are these leanings culturally induced ? That is the question . Woman 's attachment to the home and man 's separateness from it are bred into us , said Harvard 's Carol Gilligan in her book on women 's development . Girls are taught to be girls , and boys are taught to be boys from the day of birth , and by age three , gender identity is firmly in place . Girls see themselves as like their mothers who are usually the nurturers , and their identity comes from attachment , while boys see themselves as different from their mothers , and in order to develop an identity they must separate from their mothers . These identity routes become ways of relating to the world . Thus a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurturing , and caring , and a man 's identity is founded on separateness from others , which allows him to compete for personal success . A recent study of children and their experience of place by environmental psychologist Roger Hart seemed to support Gilligan 's theory that the sexual division of space is culturally ingrained . By tagging along with kids to their favorite stomping grounds , hideouts , and watering holes , and from interviews , diaries , and maps made by children , Hart pieced together how children learn to relate to the physical environment . He found , as Erikson did , that when girls built houses they concentrated on the interiors , and when boys built houses they were primarily interested in the shell of the structure and not the interior ? furnishing it with only a bed , a chair , and shelves for comic books . But there were reasons for this . Stereotyped activities were bred into the children from the earliest age with rules about how far they could roam . In fact , boys were allowed to roam nearly twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mowed lawns , and delivered papers ? activities that gave them a head start in spatial ability . Parents set the limits of where and how far a child could go to play , and boys were allowed to break the rules more than the girls . Girls are given a double handicap , said Hart . Not only are adventure and exploration restricted , but girls are also anchored inside by custom . They are encouraged to be homebodies , expected to do more chores around the house , and to babysit . The  | resulting lack of outside experience diminishes their skill in spatial abilities . Inside the house , boys and girls are treated stereotypically , too , according to other studies . Parents decorate children 's rooms differently and give them different toys , depending on their sex . A content analysis of the rooms of children under six years old showed that parents gave daughters more dolls , doll houses , and furnishings with lace , fringe , ruffles , and floral motifs ; they gave boys more vehicles , machines , military toys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time children go to college , there is a decorating and attitudinal chasm between the sexes . In a study of dorm decor it was found that women spent more time in their rooms than men and were more concerned than men about personalizing their rooms and making " a homelike environment , " which may explain the " orgy of Dior Rose sheets and pillow shams and dust ruffles , " recalled by one Wellesley graduate . These attitudes carry over into marriage , with women spending more time in the home and more time on home maintenance , and being more likely to think of the home as part of their identity , even when they have jobs and outside interests . But while women consider the home their burden , they also get more satisfaction from it than men do . Men , for the most part , are n't nearly as wrapped up in the interior of the home as women are , nor do they spend as much time at home as women do . They do n't depend on the harmony of the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood they live in , the value of the house itself , and , of course , from their work . In a study of a suburban community , Princeton 's Suzanne Keller found that 39 percent of the women , but only 13 percent of the men , spent sixteen or more hours a day in the home . Other studies of suburban life showed that men were consistently less emotionally involved in their homes than women , even though they were more satisfied with the move to the suburbs than their wives were . Apparently , men prefer living in the suburbs because it guarantees the status quo of traditional sex roles . It may be an " unconscious desire . . . to assure that their home will be taken care of by a woman with few other options . " In Sweden and Britain there have been similar findings . Brit ish husbands , it 's been shown , take pride in their neighborhood , the view , recreational facilities , schools ? and their heating sys- tems . For the wives , satisfaction with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , a roomy kitchen , attractive furnishings , and friendly neighbors . Husbands and wives were responding not biologically , said David Canter , a leading British environmental psychologist , but from their " role perspectives . " But that 's all changing , you might argue . Today men are being given permission to be caring , sharing , domestic , and paternal . In a recent commercial for canned soup , we saw a husband at the stove fixing the chowder as the wife arrived home from the office ; in an Esquire fashion spread we saw a liberated daddy holding the art of French cooking . Meanwhile , the women 's magazines have fashioned a new male role model ? the househusband . He stays home with the children , takes charge of the house , and keeps a diary of the experience for a woman 's magazine while his wife , in scenario number one , is the family 's major breadwinner and gives her all to her job , or , in scenario number two , goes back to school . TV 's Ted Koppel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for nine months once while his wife went to law school . The househusband makes good copy , but it 's not likely that the Marlboro man will be seen wearing an apron in the near future . A wordprocessing repairman who got no publicity for staying home for a year to care for his nephew while his wife finished her course in electronic maintenance , said he could have kept at it for two years at the most . " Then , I 'd have to get out of the house . " Not that men are n't doing some household chores . They are helping out more with the children . And they are cooking more . One man in three cooks one meal a week ; 13 percent cook three or four times a week , says Bride 's magazine . But study after study shows that men are masters at avoiding housework . In twopaycheck families , men are not sharing the housework . Nor is the next generation overly enthusiastic about revising the balance of power at home . In a Harris study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working believed " that one parent should stay home with preschool children .... There is some feeling that it does n't matter which parent stays home , but virtually no one says it should be the father . " As Berkeley geographer Bonnie Loyd said , the sexual division of space " is one of those  | cultural definitions enshrined in myth , taught to children , repeated by friends , and confirmed by experience . " When Elizabeth Taylor was young , she wanted to " grow up and get married and have a house with a white picket fence and six children and one maid and lots of dogs , cats , horses , and cows . " Marilyn Monroe , at the height of her celebrity , enjoyed thinking about giving dinner parties ; she wanted a comfortable chair built for a man and a chandelier with real candles . No matter where she 's headed or where she 's coming from , almost every woman feels the magnetic pull of being mistress of a house ? a house where she can bring people together around a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commercial , Revlon 's Charlie agrees it is time to settle down ; in an ad for her favorite magazine , the Cosmo girl dropped the bombshell that she was buying a house ; and in a Rolling Stone interview Bette Midler mused about what a terrific wife she would be . She knows what the job entails . " It means being an artist on your own planet . You get to have your own home , your own stage where you get to use your visual and color senses . " Women may be working , making their own money , marrying later , and divorcing more , but they are still interested in marrying the house . Why should this surprise us ? Like swimming against the tide , it takes a massive effort to resist the pull of sex roles that were internalized in childhood . Culture accomplishes in humans what nature facilitates in animals . In lovebirds , for example , hormones trigger nest-building . After mating , the female lovebird begins building her nest with grass . As egg-laying time nears , she starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bare piece of skin . This brood patch , as it is called , gets an increased blood supply which the bird will need to warm her eggs . As the patch becomes more sensitive to grass , the bird feels impelled to collect feathers to line and soften the nest . Hormonal action may prepare a young woman for marriage , but decades of custom and dozens of wedding gifts help her feather her nest . Until recently brides were marched through the  | prenuptial preparations in a behavioral lockstep passed along from one generation to the next . The details of the rituals surrounding the knot-tying may have varied over the years and from group to group , but the intent was the same . To get the daughters firmly ensconced in their own homes . The bond between a young woman and her household possessions forged over months of shopping and selection , discussion ? and perhaps dissension ? and , finally , compromise with her fiance , served the perpetuation of the species . A woman 's involvement with her housewares was an umbilical cord to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her silver pattern with the diligence of an airline purchasing agent deciding between a DC-10 and an L-1011 , choosing from among hundreds of patterns before settling on hers , made her selection public in some store 's bridal registry , unwrapped the place settings as they arrived one by one , taking the flawless pieces from their soft Pacific cloth bunting , was not merely furnishing a house . She was working her way through the most important status passage of her life . She was marrying her house . The gifts were the estrogens of the homemaking experience , stimulating the idea that my place , my things , my home , and I are one . While the furnishings were a couple 's joint possessions , it was her initials that went on the silver and linens . In the bridal registry the selections were filed under the bride 's maiden name Jane Smith ? and after the wedding , under Jane Jones , not Mrs. John Jones . And she was the one who got that exquisite feeling of pride when she set her table . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would be asked by a magazine to pose beside her exquisite table setting . Men were invariably posed beside their cars . It was just as important to nurture these home feelings in a woman as it was to encourage maternal feelings . She would think twice when she had a disagreement with her new husband before chucking it all . Celebrations of marriage with the accompanying gift-giving demonstrated the culture 's approval of the idea of family , and reinforced sex role stereotypes . In the late 1960s and 1970s it all seemed to change . If young people were marrying , they were doing it untraditionally . Down with white satin bridal pumps ? barefoot in the park was the wedding style . Down with possessions , down with registering . Who needed porcelain dinner plates in the Peace Corps or the corn- mune ? Marriage rates declined . Birth rates declined . So many people were living together the Census Bureau had to find a new designation for people of the opposite sex sharing living quarters . For the parents of these unwed couples , the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dignify the relationship by allowing them to share a bedroom when they come home for a visit ? " You can be sure that the older generation was n't about to reward out-of-wedlock lovemaking and homemaking with the material prizes that were supposed to accompany matrimony . When a young woman moved out of her parents ' house to set up housekeeping with a man , or on her own , Mom and Dad might have sent over a set of pots and pans , but capital-G gifts were not forthcoming . China patterns were not selected and registered for . The young woman needed plates to eat on , but there was no sense that the choice of those plates was meaningful . They were just plates . Not the sacred implements of matrimony , the tools of the new trade . But now , there is a new dimension to the tabletop market . Store officials and manufacturers are smiling from ear to ear . Brides are registering again . " Even brides who live in communes are registering , " said one wedding consultant . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tabletop consultant for the Lenox China company . Singles who have no intention of marrying in the foreseeable future are registering . The only explanation is , they want it all . First they wanted sex cut of wedlock . Then they wanted children out of wedlock . And now , they want gifts out of wedlock . China , flatware , crystal , placemats , candlesticks . " It 's the beautiful accessories on your table that create the subtle variations , the lasting impressions that your guests will long remember , " advised the April/May 1983 Bride 's magazine . Just because they 're not marrying does n't mean they do n't want to express themselves with their table settings . They still want to marry the house . Single women are becoming just as home-oriented as the married ones or the formerly married ones . Being single is a more varied experience than the demographic designation implies . A woman can be suddenly single , stubbornly single , temporarily sin- gle , or single-and-settled . A person 's state of mind affects her state of union with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the phone to ring to have a social life , " said a twenty-eight-year-old TV producer . " You think , the way I live does n't matter ? any min ute now I 'll get married and build my dreamhouse . By the time you 're twenty-four , you realize that if you want to control whom you see , you need to be able to entertain . To entertain you need a cute place . Between twenty-five and thirty-five if you 're still single , this way of life suddenly seems more permanent ? you begin to earn more money , maybe you sign a five-year lease or buy a condo and say to yourself , I 'm not waiting for some guy to give me a nice place ? I 'll give it to myself . " At this point the single woman becomes more like the formerly married woman who has been conditioned to have an expressive home . Pam , thirty-six , has been living alone for eleven years since her divorce . After college , the Peace Movement , three years of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs in the cosmetics industry , she considers herself lucky to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan . Many of her single friends are still folding the bed back into the sofa every morning in studio apartments . Ever since she moved out of her marriage and moved in alone , she has made an effort to create an attractive home , however minimal , using hand-me-downs such as a nice antique chest from her mother , a comfortable chair , a rug , pictures , books , mementoes . Pam still has the modular bedroom set she had as a teenager : sectional white cabinets topped with bookcases , and the cattycorner desk that works perfectly as a dressing table . To these bedroom furnishings she added an old table , skirted with a sheet , and her prized extravagance ? a blanket cover and pillow shams from Pratesi . When Pam saw the movie Rollover , she was so busy adding up the value of the bedding ? " $4 , 000 worth of Pratesi " ? she missed the notorious love scene . Her admitted goal of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , Pratesi is really a desire to be able to afford quality at this stage of her life . " It 's so hard for women to earn a living that they ca n't afford the values they 've been brought up with , " she complained . Sometimes it 's easier to say you are immobilized because of money than to admit you are waiting for a change of life . Finally Pam faced up to it . She would give herself a nice home . She wanted a living room that looked ? she ca n't put it into words ?  | " done ; of a piece . I wanted an environment where I could feel proud and comfortable and elegant and stylish . " And so she committed all of her savings , several thousand dollars , and hired a young designer . " A single man would have invested in an oil well , but I put the money into having my floors scraped and my walls lacquered , " she said quite seriously . Her storage wall ? built by a cabinetmaker , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevettes . Her custom-built , 100 percent down sofa ? L-shaped and covered in the palest blue cotton despite her mother 's warning that it would be hard to keep clean ? is capital-Q quality . It pleased Pam that nowhere in her twelve-by-sixteen-foot living room was there any Workbench , Pottery Barn , Crate and Barrel , Pier One , or Azuma knock-down tables , no chairs stuffed with beans or rattan picture frames or plastic umbrella stands that she sees in every divorced man 's apartment . Her only snipped corner was the stereo . Pam 's brother helped her select the components . It killed her to pay $650 , although she realized that most fifteen-year-old boys paid more for a stereo than she did . By the time she finishes , Pam will have spent three times more than she originally budgeted . But she does n't regret it . The apartment has the " togetherness " that she values . Not that Pam has given up on the other kind of togetherness . " I want a husband and a family and a nice worn rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman marries , the decorating wish list lengthens . The more income a family has , the more attention is paid to the appearance of the house . " Caring for the house-as-status-symbol " takes time . Not only is there cleaning and maintenance to be done , rearranging and provisioning , but also decorating . According to Bonnie Loyd , one of the few people writing on women 's issues who acknowledges that decorating is different from housework , " Decorating . . . is a major task for American homemakers , whether they decorate consciously with the help of a professional designer or casually by simply ensuring that the family has adequate furniture . " As housework becomes more automated , the  | decorating escalates . " A nice ' home reflects a good homemaker , a good wife , a good mother , and so a good woman . " Even if a woman is not a traditional homemaker , and , like 50 percent of American women , has a job or a career , she is still interested in her home . The second paycheck is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it buys is home improvements . Better living . While men are getting more involved in the buying decisions , testing the chairs , okaying the colors , the wife is still the purchase instigator on living-room and bedroom furniture , major appliances , small appliances , carpet , mattresses , and vinyl tile . Take Chris Evert Lloyd . She " picked out the colors , drapes , carpeting , and wallpaper " for her and husband John Lloyd 's villa on the Amelia Island Plantation . Did John have any decorating input ? No , said John . " I leave it to my little lady to choose , and she does very well . " Husbands are more often purchase approvers or purchase vetoers . To make all these furnishing decisions a woman has to educate herself in consumption , style , and taste . It takes as much skill to select and harmonize the contents of a home as it does to buy a million widgets for a gasket factory . At a certain income level , a family needs a wife-decorator . Actually , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the lofty standards set by the lady of leisure , one of the heroines of Western history . Her job description was spelled out by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney in his 1979 diary , Live a Year with a Millionaire , which he published for his friends . Outlining his wife Mary 's role in their marriage , he said : " First . . . she always dresses beautifully for whatever scenario we are in .... Second , she decorates and furnishes all of our homes in ways that please me and her . . . . Third , she invites the guests , seats the tables . . . . Fourth , she is a truly great cook , " and keeps her husband in good physical and mental health . His own role , said Mr. Whitney , was to keep working , enjoy his life , and encourage his wife in her projects . The wife-decorator usually has her husband 's support . He needs the proper setting as much as she does . Sometimes , however , the wife takes the decorating so seriously it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the wifedecorators with their shopping bags full of fabric samples cruising  | the design centers in major American cities . Karla , a thirty-eight year-old wife and mother , works part-time for a number of arts institutions in Chicago , serves on charitable boards , and takes postgraduate courses in business . Yet , reviewing her life , she realized she had invested a major share of her productive capacity fixing up a continuous succession of homes for her family ? two girls , one boy , and husband Michael , an electrical parts manufacturer . Her most recent design problem was the indoor pool . What started as a simple exercise pool had become a major project . It was dug once . Then Karla decided it was in the wrong place . The hole was filled in and redug again a few feet farther west . For what it cost in the end , she complained , " We could have had the finest architect in America do it . " But since it was just for Michael , not for show , she had designed it herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Michael were married . The first was a little rented house in the De Paul area where she did " a big number . . . . We used to pick up furniture on Wells Street , " she said , " go to auctions . Little by little we furnished the house and it was fabulous . I thought it was the best of all my friends ' houses . " Next came a small house in Old Town , which they proceeded to change from the ground up . Their moves could be considered budding acts of art patronage because , for structural changes , Karla and Michael always hired promising young architects . Michael loved working with them . The decor was Karla 's job . " I thought I was equipped to handle anything . " Michael , who loved to wheel and deal in real estate , came home one day with yet a larger townhouse in Lincoln Park . And the process started all over again . And now the house in Highland Park , which almost caused a divorce . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw it I was in deep depression . Faced with the mess of reconstruction , inadequate help , and the demands of children , I felt hysterical . All this responsibility . I never could share it with anyone . Michael just disappears after he 's made the purchase . I looked at this one as a chore . " But still she accepts the job . It is part of her role in her social class to be a woman of style . And necessary to her self-esteem . While she complains that her " entire life is maintenance of possessions , " her home study course in the good life has taught her there is more to aspire to . She would especially like a new  | house to tackle . Something in " the big league . " Meanwhile , there is a long list of future decorating projects in her present house . " It sounds like I need a full-time staff person for all this maintenance . But I 'm the staff . I guess anyone could do it , but I like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , everyone likes to be needed . " Despite the woman 's clear franchise to be chairperson and chief executive officer of the home decorating projects , there are some men living with women who take total charge of the furniture buying and make the taste decisions ? and the woman is lucky to get veto power . What causes a man to go against the old role model of deferring to her , or the new ideal of joint decision making ? When a man takes over the decorating , unless he 's an Arab sheik or a South American tycoon who both operate by medieval standards in these matters , there is usually a good reason . I 'll leave the men who are competing with Mom for Dad 's attention to their psychiatrists . But there are men who take charge of the furnishing because they were severely deprived as children . Perhaps they had to share a bed with their brother , and work from the time they were eight . They trust no one else to fulfill their needs . " All my life I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who took over the decorating decisions . " All my life I wanted a canopy bed , " said the well-known Mr. T , who gave himself one recently when he decorated his Los Angeles apartment . Yet another type of man needs total control , for any number of reasons . Decorators describe him as the one married male client in twenty who wo n't defer to his wife . He gets involved , takes full charge , deals with the decorator on a day-to-day basis , attends all the meetings , and approves every fabric swatch and color chip . There is also the man who does n't trust his wife to manipulate the iconography of the home , especially if he has married beneath himself , socially . When Reginald Vanderbilt married Gloria Morgan in the 1920s , she " discovered she had moved into a way of life that had existed for a quarter of a century . " She was informed by her husband that the butler would run the household because " he understands me , " and " I would like conditions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interested in his home than the design professional . Among male designers and their spouses , the issue of who is in charge of furnishing the home is the high casualty crossroads of sex role and work role . Male architects married to nonarchitect spouses call the decoration of the home " the combat zone . " The architect 's wife would be happy to have her husband build a house . But young architects are rarely in a position financially to build a dreamhouse . So they 'll settle for doing the living room . " You 're just learning to be an architect , " said one forty-year-old architect who has done battle in this field and survived to talk about it . " You have all this education . You need to manipulate and control . Having a place of your own to try your wings is a godsend . " But the wife is n't always thrilled to give up her prerogative . " If he 's honest , " he said , " there is n't a male architect alive who wo n't admit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most celebrated architect who decorated as he pleased without consulting his spouse was British architect Edwin Lutyens , who designed many great English country houses at the turn of the century . A recent memoir by his daughter reveals that although Lutyens " made a show " of checking with his wife , " he had very strong views and tastes " on decorating . Before their marriage he promised her a cheerful house with white walls and sofas covered in " jolly " fabrics . Instead , he gave her what he pleased ? glossy black walls in the parlor ? just as he once gave a client who asked for an oak staircase a black marble one . To his wife 's dismay , Lutyens valued space over comfort , and bought houses he could not afford to heat so he could have large rooms . Occasionally an architect 's wife will be delighted to be relieved of the decorating responsibility . In years past , she would have had to do the job she found odious , and her husband would have had to hold back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David , an architect , and Tina , a law student , fit into this category . Tina claims she has no interest in the decoration of her home , and that most of her classmates are n't involved in their houses , either . " I ca n't imagine anyone who has a demanding job getting involved with the house , " said Tina . In fact , if a friend were going to marry an architect , Tina would advise her : " Let him do everything to the house he wants to . " David has just finished renovating their house and most of the  | furnishings are built in . Very little furniture had to be bought . Only ( lining chairs . " David picked them out . I said , Sure . ' It 's an identity symbol for David , not for me , " Tina insisted . She admitted , however , taking hundreds and hundreds of pictures during the renovation . More than necessary or normal . " I think I was trying to say it was my project , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " One way Tina would have liked to relate to the house was to hang one of her family 's quilts over the bed . But David used one of his family 's quilts because of the colors . " But my quilts are better quality . It really pisses me off , " said Tina . Of all the reasons for men being involved with the decoration of the home , one particular reason seems to be on the rise . That is , simply , taking an interest . With sex roles blurring , men are now free to become involved in activities that were formerly considered feminine . Market researcher Judith Langer distinguishes the OldFashioned Man who expects to be pampered by women from the New Expressive Man who is more open about his feelings and beginning to share responsibilities with women . The New Expressive Man tends to be under thirty-five and does n't live in the South . But he can also be an older man in a second or third marriage . It 's not so much the age of the man as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men in long-term relationships resist change , " even when the wife 's role has changed from housewife to working woman . Men who started a relationship " in the feminist era " are more likely to participate in home furnishing decisions . As the wife of one New Man said , " My husband would be furious if I bought a window shade without him . " Henry , a thirty-year-old Farm Bureau official in Omaha , is representative of the New Expressive Man . He is totally involved with his collection of nineteenth-century furniture and accessories . Most people are surprised to hear Henry is an antiques collector ? a bit artistic for a civil servant . But Henry and his wife , Anne , an executive with a family-owned newspaper , have been collecting since they were first married and Anne 's grandmother suggested that for a wedding gift they pick some old furniture out of her storeroom ? things that no one else in the family seemed to want . They selected a grand old four-poster bed , an elaborate dresser , and an original Belter sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry refinished them all himself , something he had never done before , and found he had a real feel for it . Impressed with the  | results , Anne 's grandmother told them they could have anything else they wanted . Like many newlyweds , Henry and Anne made their furniture decisions together ; but when Anne got busy with their first child , he began shopping alone . " If I thought a piece was good enough I would bring it home to replace something we had . I know Anne 's taste as well as mine ; I can buy for our house and it 's always been acceptable . " When relatives and friends began asking for help in choosing an oak table or the kind of bed Abraham Lincoln slept in , Henry 's hobby became a weekend business . Meanwhile , he was taking charge , more and more , of the furnishing of their home . If wallpaper , a rug , or hardware was needed , he chose it . Anne had veto power . " It 's easier for her and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry . How does Anne feel about her husband taking over the job that many women still view as theirs ? " It 's like having a live-in decorator . I really do n't have the time to go out and search for things , and he just absolutely needs to do this . He cares the most , " said Anne . " I have never wanted anything common , " said Henry . " I do n't want people to come in and say , Gee , you got everything at J.C . Penney 's . " " But what about the men who live alone ? Not since the Second World War have so many men lived unaccompanied by women . Between 1970 and 1978 , the number of women living alone increased 41 percent , while the number of men living alone jumped almost 80 percent , pushing this category to 10 percent of American households . Who are these men ? Some are never-married men , whose numbers have doubled ; others are divorced men whose ranks increased 118 percent . And one of their biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their living spaces . Large numbers of single women are widows who have more furniture then they have space for . Bill most single men are furniture poor . They are starting out or start - ing over . Because so many of these single male households are in the twenty-five to forty-four age group , Home Furnishings Daily  | has dubbed them the " New Target . " From his statistical profile , the New Target is often a management executive , a salesman , or a professional making over $20,000 a year . Twenty-four percent of these men make over $35,000 . He spends an average of $762 a year on clothes and is now venturing into the home furnishings marketplace in sizable numbers . But no matter how interested a man is in his home , the process of furnishing is often bewildering . As a rule , men do n't read magazines that give furnishing ideas . They are short on time and have little experience or patience with shopping . Retailers are full of contemporary folklore about the single man who buys the complete contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily because he knows what he wants but because he hates indecisiveness . Conran 's president , Pauline Dora , recalled the bachelor who filled five shopping carts with everything from china to furniture , and the owner of Studio 54 who outfitted his apartment himself in a single shopping spree . And it is single men who purchase Bloomingdale 's model rooms , in toto . If a man does n't want to make his own decisions , he is extremely adept at getting help . Men are masters at delegating , especially those who are older or more affluent , and they often assign t heir home furnishings purchases to significant others , insignificant others , secretaries , sisters , ex-wives , even Mother . The woman who makes furnishing purchases for a man may get the mistaken idea that she is mistress of the house . Jean Harris , convicted in the shooting of the Scarsdale diet doctor , testified that she had a chair reupholstered for Dr. Tarnower , bought curtains , watercolors , a bird print , bathmats , and plastic pillows for the outdoor chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed , monogrammed towels , various plates , glassware , and an iron . Her defense attorney tried to prove that these domestic chores were evidence that the doctor 's house was really Mrs. Harris 's New York residence . In some ways , having a lesser emotional investment in the decor than a woman has can be an advantage to a man . He has no hesitation about using a decorator , if he can afford one . But the price he may pay is that his home is less authentically male . A decorator is in some respects like a wife . He or she will domesticat e the less " civilized " instincts of the man . If the man wants his trophies or his paperback collection in the living room , his decorator will shunt them into the den . When he says he absolutely does  | not want any plants , the decorator will send one as a gift . But , because a man comes to a designer with few illusions that he could do the job better than the professional , and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After six years in his completed apartment , one bachelor was still so satisfied and so grateful to his designers that he sent them each a $100 bonus . If design professionals are to be believed , his very first concern when he moves in alone is how to hang up his ties . Supposedly , after settling the tie problem , his major purchases , in descending importance , are a bed , a comfortable chair , a lamp , a TV set , a sound system , and a popcorn machine . It is assumed that the stereotypical bachelor homemaker never goes beyond buying these basics . But many men feel hurt by this image ? they reject the cliche . While there are few things you can say about the differences between men and women that are not open to debate , it is generally agreed that men view their homes more as functional objects . They furnish their homes in their own image , which they define as more rational , less emotional , and today many men are willing to stand up and be associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior vice-president Carl Levine says the single male furniture customer falls into three categories . The first is the stereotypical bachelor who really does exist , and in large numbers , said Levine . " He wants a glorified college dorm . All the furniture cliches . A brown sofa , reproduction Oriental rug , double pedestal desk , Breuer dining chairs , chrome and glass coffee table , chrome etagere for stereo and diplomas ? the stuff that he 's seen over and over and so assumes it must be right . " The single man in the second category may have been exposed to more sophisticated decor , perhaps coming from a family that had beautiful furnishings , or may just want to impress in a sex relationship . This man is after more individuality and higher style design in his apartment and seeks help from a variety of sources , He is willing to mix old pine and contemporary and is aware enough of trends to say , " I hear the radial look with marshmallow edges l in upholstery is in . " A third type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is sophisticated , extremely adventurous , reads design magazines , and is likely to do his place himself quite capably or use a designer . In Levine 's opinion , contrary to popular mythology , a  | man 's sexual orientation does not account for his interest in style . Men in creative fields , straight or gay , have more sophisticated tastes than men in other fields . And " the gay customer who works in a hospital or in law may not do his home any differently from the raditional bachelor . " One group of artifacts is standard equipment in the male den : the high-techtonics . Susan Shins , a New York decorator who specializes in helping men start over , said it is not unusual for her clients to spend one-quarter of the decorating budget on the sound and video system . One client spent $11,000 on audiovisuals and $30,000 on everything else . Heaven for the typical male homemaker resembles a recent Sony ad . A cartoon by Charles Saxon shows a young executive type in suit and tie , reclining in his leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic menagerie ? the large-screen projection TV , Betamax , tape deck , dictating machine , clock radio , amps and preamps , woofers and tweeters ugly enough to make an art history major cry . All these possessions are to the male what the accouterments of the dinner party have traditionally been to the female . The same bride and sense of identity a woman has been conditioned to get from a china pattern which stands for her taste and her social class , the audiophile gets from his multi-amp sound vehicle . The quality of a man 's equipment is a symbol of his success , and his connoisseurship . " The only difference between men and boys , " said one gadget-loving bachelor , " is the price of their toys . " The male fascination with equipment probably comes from an interest in knowing how things work , which women , one study discovered , find boring . Because men generally have no fear of equipment or technology , they have also become the best market for the $250 pasta machines , the costly electric gelati makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slob may be becoming as obsolete as the nineteenth-century fop , but one thing has not changed in ages in the interior world of men and women . Single men do not want their homes to look feminine any more than they want an aftershave lotion that is " soft and gentle . " They like a little sting in their aftershave and some toughness in their furnishings . Not that their  | rooms have to look like a men 's club , a barracks , or a pub . An office or a spaceship will do . The decor of Bruce Keiser 's four-level Philadelphia loft features streamlined detailing reminiscent of 1930s trains and lobbies . Bruce is representative of the new male attitude to the home . He is so interested in his home and its decor and so unwilling to compromise that he does not want to live with his woman friend , Diane Gingles , an owner of clothing boutiques . Instead they live in sideby-side industrial buildings that are connected via the roof . " We used to live together , but it 's always compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd rather live in my own space and visit . " Bruce and Diane 's living quarters are almost caricatures of the differences between the homes of men and women today . " Diane 's space is much more feminine , " said Bruce . " She has more objects around , more flowers , more coffee table books , more vases and statuettes , a real kitchen , and a bathtub . Her house is designed for having company ? she has a big sofa and a cocktail table in front of a fireplace , and she can seat eight at her dining table , so we 're more likely to entertain there . " His place is designed for one person . There 's only a shower and no door on the bathroom , a small living room , not geared for entertaining , and his kitchen is designed only to accommodate his built-in professional wok ? he is an accomplished Chinese cook . Bruce admits he is very conscious about the gender connotations of his decor . " My place is not feminine looking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pared down than a woman 's place . I 'm against compulsive accessorizing . " Nonetheless , he said , " a lot of people jump to the conclusion that I 'm gay . They believe that any man who has style must be . " Emily Post understood the primal fear of emasculation and its connection to decoration . " That any normal man should be repelled by the least suggestion of effeminacy is only natural , " wrote Miss Post in her 1930 decorating book The Personality of a House . In the chapter devoted to rooms and houses for a man , she went to great lengths to spell out the gender of various decorating elements as if they were French nouns . Modernistic furnishings were well suited to men , she said . Empty spaces , the absence of ruffles and curtains , and beautifully polished surfaces of wood and metal were masculine . " No woman loves the finished surface of leather , or wood , or metal the way a man does . " Floor-to-ceiling books were  | suggested for decoration . Chintzes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chintz of the **28;1970;TOOLONG variety ? scarcely ! " As for style , in the 1930 edition she suggested that Elizabethan , Spanish , or Georgian were masculine , but French was too feminine . By the 1948 edition , Early American and Modern were also certified as manly . " Every open-beamed doorless bare-walled room is obviously masculine . " As were high ceilings . But , low ceilings , she warned , had " feminine tendencies . " Today , male anxiety about appearing effeminate often manifests itself in avoidance behavior limiting men 's choices for everything from paint to sheets , towels , and cocktail napkins . One thing the New Target man does not want ? something that sold well to women ? is surface decoration . The toasters , coffeepots , and microwave-proof bowls had to be stripped of their decorations . No more stampings and decals of butterflies , palm trees , snowflakes , and the hottest hot-stamp of all ? the hex-axial variant rosette . " It was all brown , very boring male furniture . It would n't even make an interesting den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bachelor-pad furnishings . Well , what else is new ? Male living rooms are being dressed in the same neutrals their inhabitants wear : navy , black , gray , brown , beige , and luggage tan . And their beds are being made up with sheets in patterns that have connotations of Euclidean logic and rationality ? neat geometries , plaids , stripes , checks , herringbones . Martex recently introduced fashion designer Perry Ellis 's sheet designs featuring patterns of houndstooth checks and stripes . Why no flowers and lace ? Ellis said he looked at all the sheets on the market and saw that " everything was flowers and lace , that there was no room for a man in a bedroom . " And he did n't think that was right . You can be sure that if Prince Charles were living alone , his sitting room would not have contained a pretty pink sofa with pink and white flowered and ruffled throw cushions on which he was recently photographed with his wife and son for the Ladies ' Home Journal . Fear of appearing effeminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . If they are too meticulous , it is seen as not masculine . " People say things to them such as You 'll make someone a great wife , ' and they hate it , " said Judith Langer . So they feign nonchalance . " I 'm not very houseproud , " insisted one bachelor whose tastefully renovated apartment , published in the New York Times , belied the disclaimer . The major difference between  | men and women when it comes to homemaking is not that a woman designs her home for interaction with other people , while a man arranges his home for his own entertainment , even using the kitchen to clean his motorcycle or the dining room for basketball practice , both of which men have been known to do . No , the major difference between men and women is that men do n't feel ashamed or guilty about cleaning a motorcycle in the kitchen or housekeeping lapses . " When a guy 's apartment is a mess , " said a single , twenty-eight-year-old New York playwright , " he 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' When a girl 's place is a mess , she wo n't let you come up . " " Women have more of a sense of conscience about things in the house than men do , " observed a male student at Harvard Law School . It has been observed that there is beginning to emerge a new type of person : " the androgynous personality " with " sex-role flexibility . " This new modal type , said Florine Livson , the late Berkeley psychologist , is " equally at home with masculine instrumentality and feminine expressiveness , regardless of gender . " And the benefits of role-blurring are measurable . They go beyond freeing men from the sole burden of making a living , and giving women a chance to become doctors and lawyers and firemen . Apparently , people who have sex-role flexibility are at an advantage in later life . Studies show that men and women with more androgynous personalities adjust better to aging . Women who have been conditioned to be helpless in their adult years are particularly at risk when they are older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assertive and nothing else do not adjust well to retirement . Therefore , it does n't matter whether he warms up Lean Cuisine or dishes up nouvelle cuisine , whether the sheets he selects are striped or flowered , whether he paints his walls gray or aqua or shell pink . What matters is that men are beginning to be less home-phobic . While women are learning to become more comfortable outside of the home , men are becoming more comfortable inside the home . And that is one large step for woman- and mankind .   IT WAS AN April-November marriage ? a nymphette and a mogul . The mogul , Meshulam Riklis , sixty , Rapid-American wheeler-dealer and Las Vegas hotel owner , was giving a journalist a tour of his Beverly Hills mansion , complete with hot tub and pink exercise room , in which he was playing house with his pubescent bride , aspiring actress Pia Zadora . Whether Riklis wanted to disclaim credit for " the look " or just wanted to explain why he seemed a bit out of place in the energetic surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorialized on a needlepoint pillow : " It 's decorated young . " It 's decorated young ! What a wonderful expression . It brings to mind Donald Reilly 's New Yorker cartoon . A middle-aged couple dressed in their country club best arrive at a suburban party . As they wait for the front door to open , the husband cases the party through the window and exclaims to his mate : " Uh , oh , cushions on the floor . " Cushions on the floor separate the young set from the midlife-crisis crowd , whose real crisis is getting up from a fourteen-inch-high sofa seat ; cushions on the floor separate the work- out-aholics from the **34;2000;TOOLONG senior citizens ; the traditionalists from the nonconformists ; and the haves from the have-not-so-muches . Cushions on the floor are definitely " decorating young . " But like high chairs , they are eventually outgrown . It 's a sure sign of life-cycle transit when someone who has decorated young trades in floor cushions for chairs , claiming consideration for her guests . " I knew I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to visit . It was pathetic to see him sitting cross-legged on the floor , " said a thirtyfive-year-old veteran of the lotus position . Age is the underrated issue in the psychology of home and its design . Almost every aspect of behavior " can be shown to relate to chronological age , " said David Canter . But we often overlook the fact that age accounts in large measure for a person 's different needs , choices , and responses to surroundings . It has been observed that " life cycle is the universal escalator on which everyone rides , " and there is no doubt that consumer researchers , furniture people , builders , and social scientists are all fellow travelers . Marketing people divide up the life cycle by the requirements of body and role . Are we potential buyers of baby powder or denture powder ? Are we students , workers , or retirees ; freshman wives , freshman mothers , senior mothers , mothers emeritus , or consultant grandmothers ? The home furnishings industry is especially interested in our size and motor function , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradle to coffin . There are bassinets for newborns , cribs and playpens for infants , strollers for toddlers , youth beds and bunk beds for preadolescents , bean bags for restless teens , rocking recliners for the sedentary midlifers , adjustable beds for seniors . But taste also separates the cohorts of one age from those of another . In fact , changes in taste act as a kind of carbon dating system in decorating . Bloomingdale 's Carl Levine divides old taste from young according to the following checklist , which is subject to change without notice : mahogany is old , light woods are young ; Duncan Phyfe is old , rattan is young ; sofas are old , modulars are  | young ; club chairs are old , armless slipper chairs are young ; matching lamps and matching end tables are old , pharmacy lamps and trunks for end tables are young ; chandeliers are old , track lighting is young ; breakfronts are old , wall systems are young ; boudoir lamps are old , drafting lamps are young ; deep-cut glass like Waterford is old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is old , stainless steel is young ; cups and saucers are old , mugs are young ; Oriental rug reproductions are old , dhurry rugs are young . And the youngest of all are cushions on the floor . Every home has its age spots . Not even so-called timeless design can save a room from revealing the ages of people dwelling there . Having nothing on any tabletop usually denotes a toddler is in residence . Only the Manus of New Guinea have been able to train their children not to touch anything . And barnacles of family photos clinging to every tabletop , and bookcases filled with 1940s Book-of-the-Month Club selections are clues to advancing seniority . Rooms inevitably change and age over time , yet this is rarely acknowledged in the fixed plate view of the home shown in interior photographs . Homes evolve as lives evolve . Training wheels come and go . Nests fill , nests empty , and sometimes fill again . Jobs change , spouses are changed , income changes , values change . Just when the newlyweds get every one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the way . The master bedroom has to be converted to a nursery and the living room to a bedroom . If it 's not a family addition , it 's an unexpected guest . Spouses , lovers , relatives , and friends come through the revolving door . Someone becomes bedridden ; an aged parent moves in ; grown children return home for a few months . These are not one-in-amillion happenings , they are the very fabric of life . And the home has to respond to these life revisions as rapidly as an army supply depot reacts to action at the front . Quick , bring in the crib ; open the hide-a-bed ; put up some shelves ; add a room ; convert the garage ; finish the basement . In addition , we have to adjust our homes to technological changes . Where do you put the microwave when every inch of the kitchen is spoken for ? Even Future Shock author Alvin Toffler did n't predict he might one day take on another computer when he originally laid out his office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them . "  | If the house ca n't expand or contract properly , we move , if we can afford to . The social mobility of American society is mirrored in its residential mobility with almost 18 percent of the population moving each year . We rarely die in the houses we were born in . Not surprisingly , the three basic reasons for moving are all related to life cycle . A change in family configuration ? marriage , divorce , a new baby , children leaving home , a death ? is the first motivation . Soon after their marriage , William Agee and Mary Cunningham bought a house in Oyster Harbors on Cape Cod ; on the heels of her scandal-making divorce , Roxanne Pulitzer had to vacate her $1.5 million Palm Beach manse and move into an apartment ; when little Ricky started bumping into the props , television 's Lucy and Ricky Ricardo forsook their apartment and moved to a house in Connecticut ; and following the death of Natalie Wood , Robert Wagner moved the kids and their growing menagerie of dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses into a larger and more private house with stables . The second reason for moving is a job transfer . Patty Hearst 's husband , Bernard Shaw , is leaving the San Francisco police department for a security post with the Hearst Corporation 's New York office , and finding a home in New York is their first priority . Athletes , politicians , and corporate executives are the most visible job-related movers . Their house hunting ordeals and good or bad adjustments are staples of newspaper feature pages . When George Foster left the Cincinnati Reds to join the New York Mets , his wife Sheila wrote a first-person piece about the trials of moving . When basketball player Scott Hastings was drafted by the New York Knicks , his bride Judi " was not at all happy at the prospect of living in New York . . . . She 'll grow to like it or she 'll go home , " said Hastings . And when the Reagan appointees swarmed into Washington , we learned Mike Deaver had to leave his grand piano behind ; the Caspar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection ; and Alexander Haig could n't find a house he felt was grand enough . Which brings us to the third motivation for moving : to downgrade or upgrade housing . When homeowners have a reduction in income , one of the first things they do is get rid of the house they ca n't afford , cut town overhead . Because of business reverses , Billy Carter had to t rade down . People generally upgrade to bring " their residences into line with their prestige needs , " said sociologist Peter Rossi ,  | and they search the longest and look at more houses when they are upgrading than when they are moving for any other reason . This is because the house must fit a person 's social aspirations as well as space needs . And those aspirations usually center on a particular neighborhood as well as a special home . In Texas , said Ultra magazine , people look for three things in a residence : " location , location , location . " Understanding the need for the right address , New York developers whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue give them Park Avenue addresses , which apparently can bring 20 percent higher rents . And in Los Angeles , 2,500 homes just north of Beverly Hills use a tony Beverly Hills address , which is said to add 10 to 15 percent to their value . The home building industry has been the Rip Van Winkle of stage-of-life marketing . Only recently did it wake up to the need for different housing for different seasons of life . In the 1950s and ' 60s there were basically two options in housing : the single-family detached house , for sale , and the attached house or apartment , for rent . Although American families were shrinking , houses were n't . The Irvine Company of Newport Beach , California , among the most successful developers of planned communities in the country , was one of the first builders to realize you could n't sell that many four-bedroom houses to families with 2.8 members , and it started building houses to fit the new consumer needs . " The Browns are really excited about moving into their first home . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment and saving every penny . . . . " " The Jacobs have just been transferred from the Midwest . Tom works for a national electronics company as a designer , Sue is employed as a legal secratary . They entertain friends often . . . . " " The Masons are moving up from a townhouse . . . . They love the yard space for the children . " These are profiles of potential home buyers , created from market research by Irvine . Whether you 're twenty-one or sixty , want to spend $70,000 or $2 million plus , have a boat and no children or triplets and a dog , Irvine has a house for you ? or a lot on which you can build a  | dreamhouse . The Irvine people know you better than you know yourself . They know that if you 're young , you want your fireplace in the living room ; and if you 're older and more successful , you do n't want soot on your living room wallpaper and prefer your fireplace in the den . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that you 'll end up using it as a guest room or children 's room . Irvine builds for thirteen market segments , providing housing for every conceivable life style except communal living . It has condos for Young Singles like Laverne and Shirley ; accommodations for Adult Singles who give noisy parties and want their friends to be able to come and go discreetly ; houses for working Young Marrieds #1 with one kid , and Young Marrieds #2 , who have two careers and a sports car . It also has houses for the Never Nested , the grown-up two-career couple at their earnings peak ; places for the Compact Family Move-Down , which became compact when it left its large family home ; and special layouts for the Compact Divorced Family , which needs a generous family room and a master bedroom suite separate from the kids ; Irvine understands that the divorced parent craves privacy for new relationships . In addition , there are houses for the Family Move-Up , which moves up to get more bedrooms ; and for the Established Family , which needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the peak in the family 's " economic and social life-style curve . " Luxury Families that " have arrived " get a formal house ? detached , of course . Irvine also recognizes differences among peripatetic Empty Nesters , gadabout Active Retireds , and Retired stay-at-homes . There is even a double master bedroom house for couples to share . But sentiment and house attachment are not a strong component of the Irvine experience . If you need another bedroom , you do n't necessarily add on to your house . Instead , you 're supposed to trade up to another house , just as you would trade in your car for a larger one . Your roots are supposed to be on the ranch , not in a particular house there . Irvine is just one of the multitude of builders catering to special interests in housing today . It has been estimated that there are 600 communities around the country especially geared to older adults . Of the 74 million Americans over forty-eight , 2.5 million live in adult communities which are likely to be equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , condo- minium communities for singles , divorced people , and two-career couples in their thirties with no children are also mushrooming . These fitness-oriented market targets are lured with such amenities as jogging trails , swimming pools , exercise clubs , tennis courts , paddle tennis courts , hot tubs , and pool tables . Just as we have different houses for different times of life , homes mean different things to us psychologically at different life stages . While there have been a number of investigations during the past decade into the stages of the adult life cycle , none of them has correlated stages of life to housing . But surely having the right residence for each stage is a necessity . After all , how can you become your own man or woman if you are still living with your parents ? How many stages of life are there ? Solon , the early Greek poet , believed there were ten ; Confucius thought there were six ; Shakespeare , seven ; philosopher Ortega y Gasset , five ; psychiatrist Erik Erikson , eight , three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young adult 's task is intimacy , " to lose and find oneself in another " ; the adult 's task is generativity , " to make be " and " to take care of " ; while the mature adult 's task is " to face not being . " Although times of arrival and departure in a stage vary for each person , today 's life-cycle theorists generally agree that one 's early twenties is a time of breaking away ; the late twenties is devoted to the search for intimacy ; the thirties is a time of materialism and striving to consolidate a career ; the forties is a time of sturm and drang , the last chance for a major change ? a redefinition of identity ? and involves a switch from self-centeredness to nurturing and mentoring ( if this has not occurred earlier ) . In one 's fifties , most life-cycle experts agree , there is a mellowing , a settling down , an interest in immortality , a sense of physical vulnerability , a fear of mortality , and the special problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifties is the end of the line for the life-cycle theorists . For your passage beyond this point , you must transfer to gerontologists who will tell you that the next  | stage , which occurs at different times for different people , is a return to the dependency of childhood . No matter what stage you 're in , the right home can help you through your developmental tasks , but the home that 's good for one stage can impede your progress in another . " If the commune prevents loneliness before thirty , it perpetuates it afterwards , " said psychiatrist George Vaillant in Adaptation to Life , a long-range study of healthy men . " A person 's residence is in part a place to sleep , to eat , and maybe a place to raise a family , " said Daniel J. Levinson , author of The Seasons of a Man 's Life , a major study of the male life cycle , " but beyond that , it is often a center for one 's life . The place you go to be replenished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the four or five moves he and his wife have made coincided with important changes in their lives . One apartment " had a transitional quality . . . we could n't get rooted in it . It was n't an adequate base for the rest of the life . " A rented home was " a firmer richer center , " and contributed to a sense of " going home . " And buying a house for the first time coincided with expecting a child and feeling more settled . " Each home reflected important things in our lives , but the meanings changed over the life cycle . " The primary requirement of the young adult 's home is to have a place for intimacy . But by age thirty or thereabouts , it 's time to settle down , choose a new life style or affirm a former one . This is the age for " making it " socially , as well as for gains in income , power , fame , creativity , and quality of life . If there are children , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and nearness to schools , but social life for the parents matters , too . A home for this stage of life needs to support sociability , which in turn raises identity issues . As one lawyer approaching forty said , " It 's time that I had a home that expresses my acomplishments . " But that usually takes money , more money than is available . One 's pocketbook is usually out of synch with one 's image of self . Dissatisfaction with the amount of money earned reaches its peak between thirty-five and forty . Nonetheless , the emphasis in this period is on outward appearances rather than inner satisfactions , and many people go into debt to make the right appearance . The thrift shop chic of one 's first pad seems jejune now . There is a sense that it is appropriate to live in a certain way ? one ca n't beg off anymore . Even Andy Warhol 's Factory headquarters have aged  | stereotypically , evolving from the silver mylar youthquake look of his thirties ( complete with transvestites ) through a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of his fifties ( complete with rare Irish Regency and Art Deco furnishings and pre-Raphaelite paintings ) ? the culmination of managing director Fred Hughes 's plan to " establish the Factory socially as well as artistically . " When it comes to your residence , the transitions between the stages of your life are as crucial as the stages themselves . It is during life-cycle transit that you may become sensitive to the fact that your home does n't support the new direction in which you 're heading ? and often dissatisfaction with the home can signal a change in your life you had n't fully recognized or verbalized . In most cultures , transitions are heavily invested with ritual and meaning and one stage must be formally ended in order to begin another . " To mature we all have to die ' from a previous state , " wrote anthropologist Victor Turner , " and to be reborn finally as persons in control of our lives at a more challenging level . " In our culture , ending one stage involves evaluating the past , deciding which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep and which to discard . We may send some things to the attic , other things that do n't stand for us anymore we send to the thrift shop , some objects are demoted to rooms of lesser status , and still others promoted to positions of more respect . But people ca n't discard things until they are ready . " Throwing away any possession , however useless , " said French social psychologist Perla Korosec-Serfaty , " means tearing it off the fabric of one 's experience , giving it up . " This ca n't be done before one is psychologically prepared . Each person has to determine his or her own time for getting and for letting go . The hardest time in any family , said Jay Haley , the noted family therapist , is when someone is coming into a family or leaving it . " Leaving home is a crucial time in one 's life , when one has to move away from the family and create an independent home base . " Frequently , departure is not a precise moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending more and more time  | away from home while their summer clothes , skis , knapsacks , spelunking gear are still in residence . It 's not a real decampment , just a leave of absence , which is n't the kind of leave parents have in mind . As far as they 're concerned , it 's checkout time . They have other plans for the room . " I was dredging out my son 's room , hoping to discover a guest room in its depths , " said one Pennsylvania woman in a letter to the editor of a newspaper . Anxious to get on with their own transitions , parents often make a child feel abandoned . When an eighteen-year-old leaves home for college , she is just rehearsing for the big break . She still thinks of her parental home as " home . " But her parents do n't wait for the kid 's mattress to get cold before they move in with their desks and home computers . There 's a sofa bed there for the daughter , of course , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's a guest . No teddy bears on the bed , no glass animal collection on the shelves , no school pennants on the walls . And she does n't like it . New York decorator Noel Jeffrey tries to discourage his clients from dedicating rooms to grown children . He tells parents that " once away the children wo n't want to come home . " But he notices that " mothers simply do n't want to hear this . " Actually , in this situation , Mother knows best . Until the children are out and established in a place of their own , said Jay Haley , " they really need the feeling of having a home , and having their own room does that even if they are not there . At the point you visit your parents ' home and do n't have a room there , you really have left home , " he said . " Our daughter is in college and we keep her room exactly as if she were there . Not that there are n't other things we could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' home and establishing your own home base is the first step in entering the adult world and thinking of yourself as an adult . Loading up a rented van with your clothes , your TV , your stereo , a new mattress , and some dishes and moving them into your own space is the beginning of breaking away . But it takes more than one 's name on a mailbox to feel truly " at home . " At-homeness does n't happen overnight . Feeling at home in a place creeps up on you in three stages , said psychologists Jerome Tognoli and Jaime Horwitz . The first phase is transitional ? you may be living in a dormitory or group house , or a " real " house or apartment ( or series of them ) that you  | are n't attached to , or are n't ready to become attached to , that is perceived as " not home . " In the second phase , you may be living in the same place and there is an incipient awareness of home ? it 's beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a moment when you realize you require a place that truly feels like home . It could be precipitated by a desire for more space or more privacy and control , or it may just be a need for a place you can feel more attached to . Feeling really at home comes with recognizing your needs and learning to satisfy them . Some people ca n't feel at home , said Tognoli and Horwitz , until they give up the fantasy that some other place , perhaps the parental house , is their real home . In that case , they may never feel at home any place else until their parents die . Another pair of researchers have characterized the first home as " a perch , not a nest . " In their study of thirty-nine newly married couples in the Cambridge , Massachusetts , area , Florence Ladd and Kathryn Allott found that , " Frequently the husband-to-be occupied the apartment and somewhat later the wife-to-be moved in with him . " At the " lowest point in their economic growth , " most couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within their budget . It was furnished with secondhand furniture , handme-downs , and a few new pieces , including a bed , the couple 's major purchase . The husband " felt possessive about his desk and stereo . " The wife felt possessive about " her plants , the sewing machine she had had since she was seventeen , and an overstuffed chair that she had bought for eight dollars . " The rest of the things they considered " theirs . " Newlyweds gave relatively little thought to the way their day-to-day living would mesh with the layout of their apartment . When the apartment included a study , it was more often " his " study , and the wife felt deprived of a place for her homework and hobbies . It took experience for young people to be aware of their needs . No matter how many rooms they had , newlyweds spent much of their time in the same room because being together mattered to them . The focus of the first home is definitely inward , said Ladd and Allott . A clean break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next but the process of weaning yourself from your parents  | can often persist into middle age . Certainly cutting the motherdaughter cord is difficult . Because house and mother are closely linked , decorating can be one of the most trying experiences of a woman 's life , said New York psychiatrist Milton Sapirstein in his controversial 1955 essay , " More Stately Mansions : The Paradox of Decorating a Home . " Despite the passage of nearly three decades this point is still valid . When a daughter sets up her home , it is " the final declaration of independence from her mother , " asserted Sapirstein , who happened to be married to a decorator . " It says , I have equal status . ' " And if there have been unresolved differences between the two , disagreements over decoration are often used to act out old enmities . " The need to imitate one 's mother is a strong , deep force that few daughters can permanently ignore , " wrote psychiatrist Roger Gould in Transformations , another major study of life cycle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power over us , " he said , we get an " illusion of safety . " By their own admissions , daughters often allow , even encourage , their mothers ' intrusion in the home furnishing process , and once involved , mothers are not above playing power games . Some mothers see imitation as fealty . If you love me , you 'll love my favorite style . For her first home away from home , Averil Meyer , granddaughter of the late New York Mets owner , Joan Payson Whitney , asked her decorator for a bedroom just like her mother 's , a garden of flowered chintzes . Apparently such homage is not unusual among the upper classes . A House Beautiful survey found that uppermiddle-class daughters were more likely to copy Mom 's decor than lower-middle-class daughters , who were " more likely to rebel and want something different . " But rebellion is not unknown in the upper middle class . The seeds of mother-daughter decorating conflicts are often sown in childhood , maturing slowly into later conflicts . Nancy , a Houston mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up what I wanted in our six-year-old daughter 's room . She persisted in puffing the paper off the wall , not once , not twice , but three times . I tried everything . The calm heart-to-heart talk , the screaming and wringing her neck . Finally we made a deal . In two years we would redo it . " Ironically , Nancy admitted , she was doing exactly what her mother had done to her when she was a child . " My mother made my room the way she wanted it . Nothing could  | be moved . It was all white . Much of the house was all white . Everything was Look , do n't touch . " Whose room is it anyway ? Usually an adolescent 's first step toward independence is taking possession of his or her room . It 's partly an issue of control , partly young people 's attempts to find and define their own identity . But some mothers ca n't abide their children 's taste if it is n't identical to their own . " I arrange my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I come back home from college over the Thanksgiving holiday , the room is totally different , " complained Dorothy , a nineteen-year-old from San Francisco . " I 'll put all the stuff I do n't like in the basement , and after I go back to school , my mom will go down and get it and put it all back . I have a favorite pillow that I like on my bed ? she 'll put it on my window seat . I use Scotch tape to put posters up . She does n't like posters that are n't framed . At Christmas my mother said my room was a mess , so I proceeded to clean it bare ? not one thing on the dresser ? and she came in and put a little vase of fake flowers there . I took it off . Of course , my mom has really good taste . I know I should listen to her , but I really prefer a cleaner look to all those arrangements . " Dorothy worries that she 'll carry this hassle into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her many times , when I get married she wo n't get into my house . " Furnishing disputes often do carry over into marriage . In-laws are responsible for a large share of early marital problems , many of which are played out as furniture disagreements . A new husband can be jealous of the closeness between his wife and her mother from which he is excluded when so much time is spent shopping for furniture . If newlyweds are too closely connected to parents , they ca n't connect properly to each other , and both spouses can resent the demands imposed by gifts of furniture . Not until she was in the throes of a divorce after five years of marriage did Anthea , an Oklahoman , learn how much her husband had resented his mother-in-law 's interference with the decorating . Her mother is , in Anthea 's words , " an absolute lamp freak , so I have fabulous looking lamps ? and a lot of them . That 's probably why I 'm getting a divorce . My husband said recently , There 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and dad did n't give us or bring in here personally . " Some mothers or mothers-in-law fear being overshadowed by a daughter 's or daughter-in-law 's home that is more beautiful than  | their own . Mavis , a Detroit woman , has been married for more than thirty years and her mother-in-law has always been jealous of her furnishings . " If we acquired something she liked , " said Mavis , " she would decide it was too good for us and we would trade . I always let her have it . I knew it would come back . We bought a set of Chippendale dining chairs that were almost identical to hers . But she felt ours were finer and that upset her . So I suggested we switch . Then she would come for dinner and watch in horror as the children dropped food on her brocade . The chairs that I had given her were covered in a sturdy needlepoint and nothing could hurt them . They were perfect for the children . So , after maybe two months , we traded back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother-in-law 's whims , she could never get her approval ? something both daughters-in-law and daughters crave . There are mothers who try to keep control by withholding approval . Carrie , a Pittsburgh mother , was very much the family matriarch , proud of her taste and her traditionally furnished home . Her daughter Sonia rebelled by furnishing in a totally different style . When Sonia and her husband built a ranch house , Carrie could never do anything but criticize . " It was n't until after she died , " said Sonia , " that I learned she was a lot prouder of me than I realized . " " Some girls run away at fourteen , I rebelled at thirty-five , " said New York journalist Blair Sabol . " My break with my mother was over the decorating scheme . For the past seven years , I have had a total lack of responsibility for my surroundings . I was put in a high chair and my mother took charge of the choice of chairs and I let her . But two weeks ago I sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never used any living room my mother decorated for me . My place reeked of my mother 's friend , the decorator . After seven years I wanted it all trash-compacted . " My mother is the kind of person they call eclectic ? she uses Oriental rugs with Pop Art things mixed with Navajo stuff . I think eclectic means you ca n't make up your mind . When in doubt , buy both . Our house in Philadelphia was very nice but it was suffocating . When I was young I wanted a canopy bed . Mother hated can- opies so she gave me a half-canopy which was like a dumpling on the wall . It was horrible . All style decisions were made for me . As a result , I never cared how I lived . In fact , as I got older I noticed I liked hotels better than I liked my home . " I moved to New York when I was twenty-eight . My first place , a two-bedroom apartment , was also a pied-a-terre for my mother . She decorated it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors between the living room and dining area with tin chocolate molds . My bedroom was a bust . I hated it . She said , You need a dark room . ' So she did it in a burgundy high-gloss paint . The bedspread was covered with little mirrors . It was like living in an Indian store . It was so dark I could never get dressed in there ? I always ended up with one red sock and one black sock . " I decided to redo the bedroom myself . I wanted to do it light in gray and peach . But I fell flat on my ass . I discovered gray is a terrible color to paint walls and sisal on the floor is terrible on the feet . Mother did the I told you so ' number . I always had this problem wanting acceptance from my mother . So back I went into my shell , thinking I must have terrible taste . I ca n't do my own surroundings . " Then I got a job in Los Angeles . There I discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rental place and we did the house in two minutes . We picked out the chrome and glass table and the chrome and glass etagere , the white shag rug , the bentwood chairs ? the only trouble was every house you went to had the same furniture . Next I moved to a beach house in Malibu . Mother came to visit and said , Well , what are we going to do with this ? ' and I realized she had come out to decorate . When I got involved with a guy , that stopped her . She could n't stay with me , and from three thousand miles away she had no control . " When I moved back to New York two years ago , I took a major step , I found the apartment myself . I wanted it to be airy and light like Los Angeles . Mother made it dark again , rust and brown .

It was eclectic ? thick baroque Jesuit chests , Oriental rugs , a massive French Provincial coffee table , fabrics from Provence , a Brighton Pavilion chair , an Art Deco lamp , tortoise- shell-finished bamboo blinds and some Moroccan mirrors thrown in . Mother 's friend the decorator would send over a table and say , You know , Blair , it 's absolutely stunning , ' and I 'd say , It does n't exactly go , ' and she 'd say , Go ? It does n't have to go , it 's an antique . Of course you like it , Blair . There 's no discussion . ' " I always thought my mother had marvelous taste . It never occurred to me she had terrible taste for me until , one day , I was running around the reservoir with a friend , talking about decorating . I said I could n't care less about it . She said , Obviously . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I never knew it was awful . She said , If I were you I 'd get the crap out of there . ' And I said , I 'll call my mother . ' And she said , No . That 's the point . ' But how could I do an apartment without Mother ? " Recently I stayed at an ashram in Tucson . It literally had only a mattress on a board and a good reading lamp . No chair . No place to hang your clothes . Just hooks . That was it . The style I wanted . Zen Trappist monk . My mother said I could never live like that . So finally I made a decision , and I did n't discuss it with Mother . I just called up her movers . I said in forty-eight hours I want you up here . When they arrived I gave them everything in the living room except a few pictures that were dear to me and my mauve sofa which I had picked out myself .

" Life cycles are like singing rounds in camp . While kids are merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily leaving home psychologically , parents are row , row , rowing the boat into middle adulthood . By age fifty , nurturing is on the decline and people must deal with the loss of youth . Whatever has been neglected in life must be attended to . Around that time of his life , playwright Neil Simon fulfilled the fantasy of having an apartment in New York 's ritzy Ritz Tower .

With tuition bills behind them , she does n't have to make do anymore . " This is my final resting place , and if I hate the way the furniture looks , I 'm going to get something new . " This is also the season of life when people reevaluate their lives and commitments . Spouses are n't always in agreement about how they want to live .

Despite her family history of attachment to houses , she warned others about getting too involved in their homes , admonishing them to save their emotional energy for important relationships rather than squandering it on symbols of themselves .

" It is an extremely common phenomenon of middle-class and upper-class life , " said Levinson , " that a woman remains in a bad marriage to keep her husband 's income and social  | standing , which she may do a great deal to sustain . " If a woman has children , they are leaving home , perhaps taking with them the mother 's raison d'etre . Some middle-class women defend against the decline in physical beauty and the decline in nurturing by sublimating their bodies to their homes . The house and garden are cultivated with the same energy that sexual attractiveness once was . If the body ca n't measure up , at least the home can . It becomes a narcissistic object that exists to be noticed and admired .

" I just said to my husband , would you mind if I got rid of everything and started over ? " Three generations ? a grandmother , her daughter , and her two grandsons in their twenties ? were driving to a family wedding . The seventy-five-year-old matriarch was rambling on enthusiastically about her project of the last few months . She had taken a lifetime of family photos and finally mounted them in albums . When her grandsons teased her about her growing obsession with family legend , she turned to her daughter and asked quite seriously , " How come the younger generation has no sentiment ? " They have no sentiment because they are still looking forward to their lives , not back over them , while for the older generation the view is definitely through the rearview mirror . A major preoccupation of the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the obsession with going over the past , in pictures , in memory , in conversation ? helping them deal with their mortality . In aging , we regress to a new kind of dependency as a result of a decline in power that comes with physical , economic , and social limitations . The elderly inhabit a different sensory world from younger people . " My mother 's house is beginning to look like the lair of The Madwoman of Chaillot , " said one thirty-five-year-old woman whose mother used to pride herself on her fastidious home . " Lately , she has everything she ever owned crowded into  | one little room . " The homey clutter we associate with grandmother 's house is not necessarily an esthetic preference but a physiological one . Small rooms filled up with many things , said German psychologist Ernst D. Lantermann , compensate for the failing senses and give older people a feeling of control . Impaired vision , changes in depth perception , color perception , hearing , and sense of smell all account for the different sensibilities of older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange their surroundings . How can you keep an eye on your things if they 're too far away for you to see them ? For people with reduced vision , glare on surfaces has to be controlled , the glitter of a chandelier is annoying , the shine on the floor is hazardous because it appears to be water or ice . Busy patterns on seating can hide objects resting on them . Their vision does n't adjust easily to the dark . And there is trouble distinguishing among blues , blue-greens , and violets . Older people do much better with reds , oranges , and yellows . The most important thing in decor for people with poor eyesight is to have a contrast of shades among different surfaces , especially between walls and stairs . Painting her brown kitchen chairs white so they contrasted with the dark red floor made all the difference to a woman with retinitis pigmentosa . She also found that a dark bathmat , dark soap , and striped towels made it easier to differentiate these items from the white tiles and fixtures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee in them . With auditory impairment , hearing doorbells , the TV , conversation , rain on the roof , approaching footsteps , the teakettle whistling can all be a problem . Chairs that were better for conversation at right angles now need to be face to face for lipreading ; the TV has to be closer to the recliner ; telephones may need amplifiers ; doorbells may need flashing lights . Rooms need more soundabsorbent fabrics to keep down echoes . Even the resistance to change that characterizes the elderly is physiologically based , the result of their slower response to stimuli . Redundancy is security ; change takes too long to process mentally . Better to leave the telephone books in the hard to reach but at least accustomed place under the table skirt rather than move them to an accessible but hard to remember place on an end table . " I like to live in a place that I know blindfolded , where I can find my cigars without looking , " said actor George Burns , when he  | was eighty-six .

" Because of decreased agility , dull is the safest finish for a floor that can be hazardous for old people when it is waxed . And while a pleasant view is more important than ever to the person whose life is rooted in the house , wet leaves on the ground are a frequent cause of falls and broken hips . Their homes have to be challenging enough to keep the elderly active while not so challenging and hard to negotiate that they withdraw into inactivity . But the most important and most overlooked aspect of housing for the elderly is its symbolism . Just because certain furnishings get little use does n't mean they have no function . The home is often the sole remaining source of self-esteem for an elderly person . For this reason senior citizens depend on the decoration of their homes to stand for themselves , for their life history , and for special events in their lives . But decreased income can force them into housing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions . According to MIT 's Sandra Howell , a specialist in environments for the elderly , the pieces of furniture most symbolic of self to widows ? the double bed , the husband 's high dresser , and the formal dining room set ? ca n't be fitted into the space-constrained apartments of public housing . While these items may not seem all that necessary or functional to an outsider , they have an important function for the older woman . To give up these possessions is to lower self-confidence and self-esteem . Familiar possessions and places remind us who we are . Without them , we risk psychic disintegration . Older people also need familiarity with their communities . Some people who move late in life never overcome the feeling of outsiderness . Belonging to an area gives a person more status than being a newcomer , which is especially disadvantaging to people who are already devalued because of their age .

But relocating need n't always be a negative experience . Under the right circumstances it can have positive effects . Moving to another community voluntarily and getting involved in new activi- ties can compensate for the role losses that come with age . It appears that the one trait that is vital to making a good adjustment to relocation at a later age is the willingness to take risks . Studies show that people who have successfully moved to a new community viewed the move as a gift to themselves . They planned ahead to be able to " establish a new life style apart and separate from younger people , " among people who were " young-old , " energetic in spite of being elderly . Admittedly , their aim was to create a life where there was no bad weather , no bad news , and no bad apples . The most satisfied and well-adjusted relocators can be divided into four types : Explorers , Helpers , Comfort Seekers , and Fun Seekers .

Helpers find a new identity in " doing for others " as does the retired man in Queens who has adopted a public park ? mowing the lawn , among other chores . Comfort Seekers devote themselves to their decorating projects , spending a great deal of time in their new apartments which are usually an improvement over their previous homes , while Fun Seekers enjoy the sociability of retirement . When one Fun Seeker bought an apartment in Florida fully furnished , her friends were surprised . They could n't understand why an interior decorator would n't want to fix it up herself , put her stamp on it . But she had her reasons . " At this stage in my life , I do n't want to waste time fixing it up . I want to have fun . I do n't want to be running around fighting with contractors . " An internal alarm was buzzing .

But attitudes and behaviors that seem to be personality traits often turn out to be related to one 's stage of life and change as we age . This is not always welcome information .

But age as well as sex and class can influence our choices in our homes . Personality enters into it , too , in other ways .  | A RECENT EVENT in Cambridge , Massachusetts , qualifies as one of the Great Moments in Decorating . Psychologist Norbett Mintz had just been appointed to the staff of the Harvard Medical School . An office came with the territory . It was unrelievedly gray ? gray walls , a cold northern exposure , and a closeup view of the rear of a gray building . The office would have to be painted , he told the powers that be . That was impossible , he was informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would paint it himself , he said . That was completely out of the question , he was told . Union rules . Union rules ? " Either this office gets painted , " replied Mintz adamantly , " or I 'll bring down the union . " Within the week the office was painted the tannish yellow of his choice . Another professor might have made do . Academics are supposed to have loftier thoughts on their minds than the color of the walls . Decorative disarray and stylistic nonchalance are such staples of academia that when a scientist has an untidy laboratory , one study found , he is perceived as being important . Why , then , was Mintz so insistent upon sprucing up his office ? Very simple . If there is one person who has firsthand proof of  | the benefits of pleasant surroundings , it is Norbett Mintz . In 1955 , when he was a research fellow at Brandeis University , Mintz and his mentor , Abraham Maslow , the late renowned psychologist , were discussing the fact that people seem to behave differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of room esthetics on behavior . There had been studies of the effects of color ( Mintz had done some of those himself ) , and the effects of music , but never the effects of " beauty . " They decided to look into it . The first experiment Maslow and Mintz undertook was called " The Effects of Esthetic Surroundings : I. " It was designed to measure the short-term effects of three rooms ? one " beautiful , " one " average , " and one " ugly . " Would people , in looking at pictures and making judgments about them , evaluate them differently depending on the esthetic quality of the room in which the task was performed ? Three rooms were prepared as the experimental sites . The " beautiful " room was Maslow 's own comfortable beige-walled office furnished with mahogany desk and bookcase , club chair , Navajo rug , draperies , paintings on the walls , and sculpture by Mrs. Maslow . The " average " room was an ordinary no-frills , no personality , university-issue office with battleship-gray walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chair combinations , window shades , and a daybed covered with a neat green spread . Tidy but institutional . Creating an " ugly " room was more difficult . " What is ugliness ? " asked Mintz , reminiscing recently about the landmark experiment . " We finally settled on disarray and messiness as being unpalatable . " A basement room was tricked up to look like a janitor 's disheveled storeroom . There were two straight-backed chairs , a bare mattress and spring , dirty , torn window shades , tin cans for ashtrays , broom closet paraphernalia , and assorted refuse . To make sure that the rooms would , indeed , be perceived by  | others as beautiful , average , and ugly , a control group of students was asked to comment on them . The beautiful room was rated " very pleasant , " " very nice . " The average room evoked such responses as , " Well , how should it look , it 's an office . " And the ugly room elicited such remarks as " hideous , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " ugly . " In that case , how did the students in the control group feel about working in these rooms ? Did they think they would feel any different spending time in one or another of these rooms ? Good question . Certainly , no one wanted to spend any time in the ugly room . But neither did any of the students foresee a benefit from spending time in the beautiful room as opposed to the average room . Being in the beautiful or the average room would be " equal , " the students predicted . Were they right ? Did esthetics make no difference ? The decorators , furniture and wallpaper dealers , and paint manufacturers of America are going to like this . In fact , beauty seemed to make an appreciable difference . Stationed in each of the three different rooms , an " examiner " asked students , one at a time , to look at ten negative-print photos of people 's faces and to rate them for energy or fatigue , well-being or displeasure . Students judging photos in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the students who were rating them in the ugly room . And students in the beautiful room found even more energy and well-being in the faces than those judging the same photos in the average room . According to Maslow and Mintz , the only thing that could account for the different ratings was the esthetic differences in the three settings . In a follow-up experiment , Mintz examined the long-term effects on the examiners of working day after day in the beautiful room compared with working in the ugly room . Again there was a notable room effect . Examiners stationed in the beautiful room over the course of three weeks felt powerful , comfortable , energetic , enthusiastic , and were n't at all anxious to stop their tasks , while those working in the ugly room suffered a whole range of unpleasant reactions , from headaches to fatigue , irritability , hostility , and room-avoidance . When the examiners were asked what they thought might have accounted for their moods , only a few of them saw a possible connection between the room and their state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small  | percentage of the subjects involved were aware of it . For most , the effects of the environment were subliminal . If Maslow and Mintz were right , the more pleasant the room , the better people feel in it , the more energy they have there , and the more positively they regard the tasks they perform there . For anyone who needs a slipcover justification or a redecorating rationale , these studies should do nicely . Were furniture industry folks as well read in psychology as they are in flammability standards and housing starts , Maslow and Mintz would have been made Men of the Year by now . Of course , the idea that beauty is functional is hard for Americans to accept . Studies have shown that skepticism about the benefits of beauty and the usefulness of esthetic experience runs deep in our society , contributing to the attitude that beautiful surroundings are nice , but not a necessity . This undervaluation of a pleasant environment may stem from ignorance about the nature of esthetic experience . It is probably no coincidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esthetic choice as well as of biological survival , said Norbett Mintz . Infants develop a taste early on for foods that are good for them . Bad-tasting food can kill . And bad taste in surroundings ? that is , any taste that is not our taste ? makes many of us feel physically threatened . The esthetically sensitive repeatedly use food metaphors to describe environments that displease them . " Ugly rooms are like a bad meal , " said one designer . " Some rooms have so much color I could gag , " said another . " I hate those candy sweet colors , those pale yellow rooms with peach windows and mint on the furniture ? it 's like being force-fed pralines and cream . They make my gums ache . " These are apt metaphors . Esthetic experience is as much physical as it is psychic . It is the search for pleasure and the avoidance of pain , and involves attraction , arousal , stimulation , and satisfaction ? and their opposites . To endure surroundings that are not your taste gives you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Psychic satisfaction is related to physiological well-being , " said James Marston Fitch , the noted architecture  | critic and Columbia University professor . While we perceive our surroundings with our eyes and our senses , we react to the slightest changes in combinations and intensity of color ; to odor and order ; monotony , complexity , and disarray ; noise and music ; the familiar and the unknown physiologically , with gut reactions that reverberate throughout the immuno- , cardio- , and adrenal systems , affecting brain arousal , steroids , and hormonal balance . We ca n't really like a place unless it feels good physically . Human habitats are almost uterine , said Fitch , and the body reacts violently to extremes of sensory experience . It is known that sensory overload can destroy rationality , and sensory deprivation can reduce people to gibbering incoherence . So we should not be surprised that there are physiological responses to less radical situations . In fact , pleasant sensory stimuli can make the heart beat faster and provide a physical sense of well-being and satisfaction . Most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go out of their way to get those pleasure rewards from visual and other sensory stimuli . But mental satisfaction can also be had from esthetic experience . There is strong evidence that the appreciation of beauty has evolved from the basic human need to make sense of our environment ? to understand what is good and bad for us in our surroundings . Both humans and animals have to distinguish the noxious from the harmless . In order to predict events and plan behavior , experience has to be organized , every stimulus has to be noticed , evaluated , classified , and appropriate action taken . It is not only the obviously dangerous conditions such as fire or lack of oxygen that must be evaluated and acted on , but also the weather , the terrain , and the presence of other humans or animals . Decisions have to be made : Is this good for me or bad for me ? Will I feel good in this place or bad in it ? What can I do about it ? Esthetic judgment is developed by noticing relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacting to them . It involves recognizing balance , harmony , complexity , and rhythm ? the likeness tempered with difference in objects , sounds , sights , and smells ? and then relating these to previous experiences , deciding whether to eat an object , fight it , flee it , or ignore it . The capacity for making distinctions on which life and death decisions are based has developed over time into esthetic awareness , said animal biologist Nicholas Humphrey . Just as there is  | pleasure in sex without procreation , there is pleasure in sorting things out for no other reason than the enjoyment of looking at pictures , selecting a color scheme , searching for a special shell , naming that tune . Indeed , being sensitive to one 's surroundings is a sort of calisthenics for the mind , which is entertaining , challenging , satisfying , and good for you . But how do we know what sort of physical situations are good for us ? One way is to turn to studies . Certain environmental investigations have shown that we leave more packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions and in hot weather we are less helpful ; a request for a salary increase in a noisy room nets a smaller raise than if the request is made in a quiet room ; and we tend to disclose less to our therapists in cold , bare rooms than in cozy spaces . When scientists want to measure the effects of certain environmental stimuli ? the color of the walls or the level of light ? they hook their subjects up to sensors in the laboratory and chart how the heart and brain react to a red room or a dark room . But most of us ca n't spend our days tethered to machines to ascertain when the moderate and pleasurable arousal of novelty in a setting becomes the heartburn of too much complexity . We ca n't have technicians in attendance measuring how much overstimulation prompts the heart to compensate by slowing down heartbeat . And , luckily , we do n't have to . Each of us has a built-in mechanism for keeping the body from self-destructing . It 's called preference . An organism must prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said psychologists Stephen and Rachel Kaplan . Preferences may not replace stress tests but they " are important indicators of environments in which people can be constructive and effective . " But there 's a hitch . Even when we know what we like , we can be convinced otherwise . Beauty , unlike the color , form , weight , or odor of an object , is not an innate attribute . Designating something as beautiful is a subjective judgment , said Fitch , an award conferred by the mind . And the human mind has other priorities than pure pleasure . Every day we forgo gratification for social rewards . We give up sweets to be thin , meat for Lent , sex for religious or moral reasons . Similarly , we may reject houses , objects , and perfectly good solutions to our homemaking problems because we do n't like their connotations . Judgments of beauty or ugliness are  | never based purely on formal esthetics or gut level preference . They can always be prejudiced by the meanings that become connected to a style , pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials is embarrassed that her wood floor has an easy-care polyurethane finish . " It 's not what I believe in . " Another person wo n't have any patterns with birds in her home because she feels it 's bad luck ; people of one religion rule out patterns with crosses , those of a different religion reject designs that have a hint of a six-pointed star . And comes the revolution , of course , there is always a change in taste . What was coveted the day before is suddenly despised . After the French Revolution , Frenchmen did a taste about-face wanting nothing to do with the cabinetmakers popular with the court . If religion or politics or symbolism does n't prejudice us against a style , fashion will . Yesterday 's avant-garde favorites , such as supergraphics , log furniture , and arc lamps , are now as passe as bellbottom trousers . Fashion is a perpetual game of Us against Them , a balance between conforming to one group while setting ourselves apart from another . As soon as the group from which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must switch course , adopt a new style . If esthetic preferences can be so easily ruled and overruled by outside forces , what role does personality play in our place-making ? Psychologists believe that personality differences can reliably predict one individual 's fascination with possessions and another 's disdain for them , as well as different orientations to privacy , the penchant for antiquarianism or tinkering , the taste for the suburbs or the backwoods . Although theory is still in the formative stages , the hot topic in personality and environment research is dispositions ? and it is related to preferences . Human personality is composed of a complex variety of interconnecting needs , motives , values , attitudes , temperaments , actions , and traits that operate as a whole system . Psychologists believe that our preferences are clues to personality traits , but there is no agreement on whether traits remain constant over time and across situations . Therefore , many psychologists prefer to talk  | about dispositions . An infatuation with purple or Queen Anne style furniture is a passing pteference that may come and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a behavioral trend , an individual 's unique and recurring method of activity and problem solving , a style of operation , a modus operandi . Each of us tends to personalize space in characteristic ways , becoming a specialist in color coordination , tabletop arrangements , lawn maintenance , or other creative endeavors . To dope out your own dispositions , you do n't have to take elaborate psychological tests . According to Canadian psychologist Brian Little , all you have to know is this one rule of thumb : " You are what you prefer to do . " If you have a particular way of relating to your home , if you repeat it , and if you find it satisfying , it 's probably a disposition . Thus , recurrent choices , activities , or ways of attacking a project that a person finds salient add up to a summary statement of one 's personality . But do n't be misled . What appears to be a disposition for one thing can be a disposition for another . Taking on a major housebuilding project does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I built my house myself , " said Kansas State University architect and psychologist Paul Windley . " I did it for economic reasons . I would never have attempted it except for the fact that my father-in-law is a contractor . To think of building a house for fun is not in my repertoire . " Rather than a disposition to build , he said , " Perhaps it was a disposition to save money . " And when Francis Gabe , an Oregon housewife , built herself a Rube Goldberg-type wash-and-wear , self-cleaning house with sprinklers in the ceiling to dispense detergent spray , her motivation was not so much an interest in good housekeeping as a loathing for it . Cleaning was her excuse , but when someone works eight years on building a house , you can be sure she has a disposition to build . Abilities can influence dispositions . " The more competent you are in a domain , " said Little , " the more you like to do it , the more you do it , the better you get at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more it stands for you . " Certainly abilities have a lot to do with one 's choice of homemaking activities . Depending on how frequently you engage in them , and how skilled you are at them , these activities can be merely leanings or full-blown dispositions ? in which case you would incorporate them into your self-definition.  | As the kids would say , " A ' my name is Alice , my favorite color is avocado , I come from Alabama , and I adore antiquing . " The five modes that are most often used to make our homes our own are selecting and acquiring ; arranging and organizing ; housekeeping ; conserving and restoring ; and handiwork and gardening . ( Collecting is an aspect of selecting and acquiring , but because it is such a unique endeavor , it needs to be treated separately . ) If you become known by your compulsions or your pastimes , it 's a sure bet they are dispositions . Barbra Streisand is an antiques selector and acquirer nonpareil . Lady Diana is emerging as a compulsive organizer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put back precisely in line in the cupboard . She is obsessed that everything around her be perfect , " said a palace informant . Joan Crawford was known for her compulsive cleanliness , which was put to the test daily in her fabled white carpeted living room . New York consumer reporter Betty Furness is a dedicated needlepointer of rugs and pillows and her home was designed as a background for her handiwork . Jimmy Carter is a woodworker ; astronaut Colonel Jack Lousma likes to build things around the house , as does actor Hal Holbrook . And Joyce Ride , mother of astronaut Sally Ride , is casual about housework but a diligent gardener . Specialists in one or another of these areas tend to approach problems from their own perspective . Given a shortage of storage space , the shopper would think first of buying an armoire ; the arranger would turn some shoe boxes into space organizers ; the good housekeeper would clean out the cupboards to make room ; the conservator would convert an old wardrobe trunk into an extra closet ; and the builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting and acquiring material possessions for the home depends on how one relates to objects . In the course of our daily lives , we have all noticed that certain acquaintances care more for things than for people , or more for people than for things . Elsie de Wolfe 's biographer observed that Elsie found houses and furniture " a happier adventure " than the people she met or the parties she attended , and that she was " far  | more comfortable expressing her passion for buildings and objects than for people . " Apparently one 's disposition to things ? whether one can take them or leave them ? is a basic aspect of personality , which is just beginning to get the attention of social scientists . A recent study by two psychiatrists found that infants can be classified as either thing- or people-oriented . Thing-oriented tots learn the names of things first . When they play house they are interested in the equipment , and to calm them , parents have to offer an object ? a stuffed animal , a doll , a ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles when they play house . To calm a people-oriented child , parents have to offer themselves . Brian Little believes that two categories are n't enough . He has isolated four types of " specialists , " as he calls them : Thingspecialists , Person-specialists , Self-specialists , and Generalists . Thing-specialists not only care about things , said Little , but are also intrigued by them . They are fascinated by the physical properties of objects , their form and their function , often disregarding their social impact . So what if the chair is n't comfortable ? It looks good . Person-specialists are sentimental , they associate things and places with people and tend to personify them . Their homes may not be visually coordinated , said Little , " but every place in the house is sacred . " They want their chairs to be comfortable for family and friends , and to heck with the looks . Self-specialists see everything from a personal point of view ? the chair has to suit themselves alone . Generalists balance an interest in people and things . They care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer to be a generalist , " said Little . Every selection one makes for the home will be influenced by these attitudes to things . Picking and Choosing : Color Connections The rich may commission their homes and have a say in the design , but the majority of people " select rather than create , " as the late psychologist Donald Appleyard put it . Even when we 're not open to buy , we are choosing . When one passes a store window or looks at a mail-order catalog , one is constantly assessing whether an item of furniture or apparel is " For me or not for me . What could I use it for ? " Shopping and comparing is one of the  | ways we flex our visual senses . How much we like something has to do with its familiarity or its novelty . The familiar can range from comfortable to boring ; the novel from exciting to outre . But to avoid stimulus overload and total chaos , we all have to make choices of goods and activities . While it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be termed a disposition , an interest in color and color aptitude is a disposition . Color memory , the ability to match and discriminate among colors , is inborn , but the eye can be sharpened with training . Color is the front line in esthetic choice . That may be because infants can distinguish color before they can distinguish form . Experiments have shown that baby chicks will open wide for a red stick , mistaking it for the mother 's bill . Unless you are color blind or indifferent to visual discord , color coordination is the easiest way of ordering the environment . Besides , having a favorite color reduces anxiety on the way to the checkout counter . In a world where everything from candles to soap , scrub buckets , can openers , paper plates , tissues , and directors ' chairs are available in a rainbow of hues , having a preference is defensive ? it helps avoid time-wasting indecision . Once a decorating color identity is found , color coordination can be quite obsessive . Beige was the favorite of Elsie de Wolfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly exclaimed , " It 's my color . " Red is Diana Vreeland 's signature . Yellow is Dinah Shore 's . And who does n't know that lavender is shared by Miss Piggy and Liz Taylor ? Writer Phyllis Theroux defined color favoritism as a kind of loyalty : " I always pick blue gingham , if available . Blue gingham constellates a galaxy of memories ( beach , ocean , the first placemats in my first house ) that confirm me . " We tend to feel self-conscious about our color . choices because we have been told our color schemes will betray us . Color experts would have us believe that color preferences are related to character or personality and have the same meanings for and effects on all people . They advise us that the colors we choose have deep intrapsychic significance , that behavior can be controlled by the color of the walls and people can be analyzed by their choices . Color preferences are " as telling as body language , as revealing as psychology , as inescapable as astrology ... " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color authority Faber Birren . He called red the color of extroversion and manic depression , yel- low the color of high-mindedness and mental deficiency , a preference for green a trait of people who are probably overweight , middle class , and never engage in extramarital activity . In Psycho-Decorating , Margaret Harmon ( with a master 's degree in psychology ) proposed a system for doping people out from the colors of their living room decor . A room done in one color , Harmon said , means the woman who decorated it has " a highly developed conscience . . . . Bright red is associated with willingness to give in to other 's wishes . . . brown reflects a capable attitude . " Neutral colors on the sofa reflect an " independent manner , " but on the windows " self-doubt " ; black " reflects a rational attitude ... an interest in accomplishing things " and is related to " a desire to stand out from the crowd . " And green is popular with so many different types of people , said Harmon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares not what a color tells about you , but how it can influence your behavior . Alexander Schauss , a former counseling psychologist in the prison system , has gotten an extraordinary amount of media mileage from his claim that a raving mad prisoner could be calmed down for twenty minutes by placing him in a cell painted bubble-gum pink , although Mr. Schauss admitted there have been no controlled experiments to prove this claim , which many scientists have found questionable . But proof does n't stop Schauss from making this and other color presumptions . He advised against using pink in a bedroom . " Pink affects muscle strength and the penis is a muscle . Pink puts a male in a weakened condition . . . . Sex , after all , is an aggressive act , " he said . He also claimed to have found a color that will help manic depressives , as well as a shade of green that increases strength but he 'd rather not disclose its exact hue for fear " some sadistic individual might use it to drive a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color psychics ? Can color really control us or reveal us in predictable ways ? Beware of sweeping claims about the power of color . No aspect of psychology is as susceptible to review . " More nonsense has been written about color effects than about any similar phenomena , " cautioned Corwin Bennett , professor of industrial engineering at Kansas Mate University and author of Spaces for People . Many of the innumerable studies on color are contradictory , which may be due , he said , to poor research but more probably to the fact that " many  | reactions to color are very small effects . " Color undoubtedly affects people , but its effects vary from person to person , said Norbett Mintz . " Some people wish for colors that contrast with their personality , others want a similarity to their personality . " To be told that color analysis is specious is like being told there is no Santa Claus . We hate having color-voyancy debunked . We want color to have magic properties . We long for it to be significant , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color vibrations , " said actor Ken Page of Broadway 's Cats , who decorated his bedroom with purple walls and ceilings because " purple for me , being a Capricorn , is supposed to be a very good energy color . " What is underrated in most color preference work is the power of symbolism , context , custom , as well as fashion , all of which have influence on our reactions to color . This is a perfect example of " I know what I like but I can be convinced otherwise . " Color has at least as much power over us through its symbolism as through its wavelengths . All colors are not equal . Certain hues and shades are considered appropriate or inappropriate for certain situations . If you doubt it , just listen to people howl when someone commits a color crime . In Litchfield , Connecticut , the residents were up in arms when the Methodist Church was painted gold , blue , and brown , and in New York City there was a stir when the Art Commission tried to paint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's first symbols . In traditional cultures colors had power and their meanings were known and shared . Today , colors are still surrounded by a web of symbolism . Yellow , a popular theme color for weddings in this country , is not considered suitable for wedding decorations in France , where it is the symbolic color of the cuckold . White is the color of mourning in many cultures . But in the early twentieth century , white walls and kitchens signaled " sanitary awareness . " White rugs and upholstery , on the other hand , were a sign that one was wealthy enough not to have to worry about getting the furniture soiled . The allwhite room , often credited to decorator Syrie Maugham in the 1920s , was actually inspired by the wife of a wealthy British coal merchant who decorated her house all in white ? the antithesis of coal , and a symbolic color choice if ever there was one . While red is probably the most popular color in the world , there 's a big difference , as one psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast . With color , if you like it , it 's probably good for you . But what you like has a lot to do with other factors than color appeal . After people choose their color , they usually choose their style . The real estate agents want to know what kind of house is desired ? a house with a flat roof , a peaked roof , or a butterfly roof ; the furniture salesperson needs to know whether to show the shoppers through the Colonial Corner or the Urban Gallery ; the wedding guests want to know if the newlyweds are modem or traditional . Are they like the readers of Colonial Homes magazine who " do n't live in the past , they just visit " ? Which era do they visit ? The gift giver must decide between an ice bucket with clawfeet ( traditional ) , ball feet ( contemporary ) , or no feet ( modern ) . A strong and repeated style preference for country or traditional or modern , carried out with a passion , can be considered a disposition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than on some pure esthetic response to it . Perhaps you thought that style decisions were totally independent , free of outside pressure , a matter of formal esthetics between you and the pattern perception center in your brain . Sorry to disappoint you . Like color choices , decisions about form are influenced by outside forces . The associations a style has for you can influence your perception of it . What you pay attention to , what you prefer in forms , ornament , and proportions depends on your past experiences and the cultural meanings that attach to a particular type of design . It is almost impossible for most of us to separate our affection for furniture of a certain period from its meanings . If you do n't inherit prejudices for or against certain styles from your family , you pick them up along the way . Those who ca n't read the sign language of furniture can always turn to a semiotician who will interpret for them . In the nineteenth century architect Andrew Jackson Downing decreed that rustic arbors on a house give it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke Eastlake , pushing the quaint Queen Anne style , said the use of wooden pegs in a piece of furniture " had sincerity , ' a nail did  | not . " Later John D. Rockefeller called the Williamsburg , Virginia , restoration an example of high purpose and " unselfish devotion of our forefathers to the common good . " Styles represent moral judgments ? and affiliating with a style bears a certain resemblance to converting to a particular religion . If styles were n't meaningful , why , in 1967 , would NASA have furnished its Houston lunar reception area in imitation Colonial ? Colonial has been riding high ever since 1885 when the Daughters of the American Revolution and other reform groups , in a xenophobic reaction to European style , led a campaign to Americanize . Nothing is more popular today than some form of traditional styling , whether it is native American or Old World . Symbols of tradition link people to ancestors or family values , said Berkeley psychologists Maryann Jacobi and Daniel Stokols , providing " a sense of continuity and identity within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to carrying on a tradition , and emotional links to some other time and place . Often in decorating , however , the past people attempt to link up with is not their own family 's but a more illustrious one . Old furnishings give a sense of family genealogy ? the illusion of legitimacy . " Kinship is so entwined with social class , " said sociologist Anselm Strauss , " that a deficiency of kinship memories means also deficiency of class memories . " And to compensate for this , rooms must look as if the furnishings have been in the family for generations . This may explain why in order to snare the plum residential jobs , young designers who used to turn up their noses at traditional are all boning up on Eighteenth century . Rooms " must not look new , " said established New York decorators Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade . " They must give the impression that they evolved over generations , never touched by a decorator . " " Newness is something I generally find disagreeable , " said New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique is modern , Yi-Fu Tuan reminds us . Reverence for the old has to do with a culture 's concept of time . The Chinese do n't revere old furnishings , they revere old ideas . In Japan , the design of the Shinto temples , which arc rebuilt every twenty years , is considered more important than the original structure . In the Renaissance there was no compunction about using stones scavenged from the Colosseum to build other  | structures . Not until the eighteenth century when it was prestigious to collect odd relics was there real interest in the past . But perhaps the most subtle reason for the popularity of things that are old or look old is fear of the future . " When people . . . feel they are in control of their destiny , they have little cause for nostalgia , " said Tuan . What better example than the home of astronaut Sally Ride , which , according to published reports , is decorated with souvenirs of the space age . She faces her future squarely with space-shuttle dishes , NASA posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , when people think change is occurring too fast " nostalgia for the idyllic past waxes strong , " Tuan said . Americans may be fascinated with the future , but they do n't want to live in it . After spending an evening with Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi , they go to sleep in their Early American , Eighteenth-century , or Mediterranean beds . The home computer is the fastest growing consumer product category , but contemporary-style furniture has only a 27 percent market share . Even people who like new furniture are n't necessarily interested in new styling . In a recent Better Homes and Gardens survey the majority of readers preferred new furniture to " secondhand , " but only 15 percent of those people wanted the latest style . A taste for the new is often a reaction to the past , which is what worries the establishment . When Napoleon became emperor , he sent the contents of Versailles packing , stating he wanted to " make new , not buy old . " People who live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they read about extreme new styles . They see any home that is a radical departure from their own as a rejection of their values , and therefore their way of life . With limited money , the young rebels can shake up the establishment by merely declaring ' torn draperies beautiful . Two New Wave designers in New York who use glitter and pearlized paint and car upholstery proclaim that their work is " a process of breaking unwritten design laws . " That 's what worries the people who like things that are old . Another aspect of the new is its moral attitude toward excess . The old look in decor is full and complex , the new look is spare , simple , and " minimal . " Minimal is a style of restraint , an appetite suppressant for possessions , a room on a diet , in reaction to a  | lifetime binge on materialism . " My main project this fall is getting rid of things , " said an anonymous writer in The New Yorker 's Talk of the Town column . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize I do n't want to die and leave behind a pile of little boxes from Azuma . " But once you shed the tchotchkes , you have to go on a maintenance diet ? vow to live a life of unparalleled neatness , dedicate yourself to the upkeep of space rather than objects , resist buying the unnecessary , and if you ca n't , store your things in someone else 's house . For a room to qualify as minimal it 's not enough to dispose of everything . The emptiness must be designed . What this style lacks in clutter it makes up for in detail . When most people want their furnishings movable , the minimal look depends on elements that are unrelentingly immovable ? built-in steps , platforms , ledges , and niches . Plain backgrounds are as costly as embellished ones because it 's more difficult to get a perfectly smooth plaster doorjamb than it is to hide the joints under moldings . When designer Hazel Haire chose to simplify her life , she and her husband put themselves in the hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long to prepare a minimal space for occupancy , but as it turns out , minimal requires more work than maximal . " It all seems so simple , it looks as if we did n't do anything , but it took an army to get us to this stage , " said Mrs. Haire . What was supposed to be an eight-week job took a year . With the walls austerely blank , there was no place to put the books they absolutely could n't part with . So the Haires began looking for a second home in the country to house the overflow . Here again is a case of knowing what they liked ? books ? but being convinced otherwise . Minimalism is actually " conspicuous austerity . " Its exquisite emptiness is not a sign of poverty but the height of luxury . Like the Japanese tea ceremony , it is the epitome of consumption , not the rejection of it . Planning , making order out of chaos , seeing relationships and connections among disparate things , are all part of the arranging disposition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people who are drawn to this activity fall into two dis- tinct types ? the macroarrangers who concentrate on moving furniture and the microarrangers who see mantels and tabletops as their canvas . Macroarrangers think big . These are not the people who arrange their chairs , sofas , and tables once and forever . Fuzz balls do not grow under their breakfronts . They move their inventories continually , anxiously , always looking for better juxtapositions . The stereotypical chronic furniture mover is a neurotic housewife , presumably expressing her unhappiness by changing the position of her sofa rather than changing her life . Furniture moving can be a signal that aspects of one 's life are out of order , but it can also be a constructive attempt to improve on the existing order . We ca n't truly possess our furnishings until we control them and we make t hem our own by deciding how they 'll be deployed . Sometimes the macromover is a space planner trying to familiarize herself or himself with the terrain . " Man 's feeling about being properly oriented in space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is linked to " survival and sanity . " To be disoriented in space is to be " psychotic . " We need to be familiar with our spaces not only to live in them comfortably but also to be able to escape fast in an emergency . When the smoke alarm goes off , it 's good to know where the foot stools are . Other furniture movers are social directors trying to improve communication . How far chairs are from one another and whether they face or adjoin can influence how chummy people get . When your conversational partner is seated twelve feet across the room , it 's like having an intimate discussion on a speakerphone ? you hesitate to ask for unpublished details of the palace coup . The chronic furniture mover may also be an explorer , open to change . In a study of an Ithaca housing development it was found that 50 percent of the people who rearranged their furniture did it for variety . Nineteen-year-old Amy is known in her Boston college dorm for her furniture-moving disposition . By the middle of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times . Why ? " I do it when I 'm bored , " she explained . It 's also a way of getting approval . She and her roommate " had a lot of compliments " last year when they improvised bunk beds . Pamela , a California woman , moves furniture for stimulation . " I really love change , " she said . Some of her furniture moving episodes coincide with changes of season . In the summer she likes to  | put the secondhand dining table covered with the spiderweb scarf near the window and the view ; in the winter she sets it in front of the fireplace . " When I move furniture there 's so much energy , it starts my mind thinking about how I can make other changes in my life . After I move things I end up making changes in myself , my hairstyle , my work , my job . " Making small-scale arrangements is , in decorating jargon , " accessorizing , " which is not far from what hot-rodders do to their cars . Formerly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'd find in the storeroom of a natural history museum , accessorizing caught on with the bric-a-brac-mad Victorians , and interest in the art has never flagged . Shelter magazines show exquisite closeups of tabletops and mantels laden with bouquets , teensy picture frames with photos of the Queen Mother , marble eggs , china ladybugs , Battersea boxes , and bronze dogs , and homeowners feel obliged to accessorize . Every tabletop a still life . Ideally the memorabilia on your shelves and mantels and coffee tables should be accumulated over time and have meaning for you . But when you read in your favorite Home Section that accessories " can make or break rooms , " and that " tabletops should have a composition just as a painting does , " you almost feel obliged to go out and fill your shopping cart with the right objects . No selfrespecting amateur arranger will settle for less than the Billy Baldwin minimum ? a discreet and artful arrangement of exotica on each and every tabletop ; here a few turtles , there a cachepot , Oriental boxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a stand , a pair of candlesticks , a decoy . Accessory anxiety is not exclusive to the upper and upper middle class . Taking advantage of the middle-American woman 's accessory-inferiority complex is Mary Crowley , a Texas matron who poses for her publicity photos holding a mink-covered Bible . She heads a $400 million Home Interiors &; Gifts business that is modeled on the Mary Kay cosmetics sell-it-at-home sessions . To ensure " that no home in America is ever dull or unattractive , " Crowley pushes brass leaf wall plaques and flying gull wall ornaments , mirrors , candlesticks , and " permanent foliage , " meaning fake ferns . But once you have the stuff , you still have to arrange it . Loretta , a young Texas matron , used to depend on her mother to make her still lifes . " I 'm good at tearing down walls and picking  | colors , but I ca n't arrange things , " explained Loretta . " Mother was wonderful about putting knickknacks around and displaying things in the bookcase . " Since her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting Loretta every six months and reorganizing her accessories . In between visits , " if one of the kids moves something , " said Loretta , " it stays there until Aunt ' Rae comes back . " Styles of arrangement are grammatical , suggested psychologists Jurgen Ruesch and Weldon Kees . Some people arrange by " subject , " they said : all the ladybugs or horse pictures together . Others arrange by " predicate " such as high things or green things together . Books are a perfect example . Scholars often file their hooks by subject , putting a diminutive book on butterflies next to a large one on the same topic . The more visually oriented person tends to file by predicate . Architects , for instance , are prone to arrange books by size ? all books under nine inches in height grouped together ; and decorators are not above grouping books by jacket color , irrespective of subject . Making extreme predicate arrangements , perhaps putting lemons and yellow pencils in the same place , is supposed to be a sign of schizophrenia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her regiments of relics . Piling , filing , hanging , grouping , shelving , and aligning . A gentleman in San Francisco liked to arrange his towels side by side with the diagonal stripes heading in alternate directions so they formed a chevron pattern . Some people must have balance .

And the Duchess of Windsor once said , " I get ulcers if anything is crooked . " When objects are placed directly on a surface it is called " naked contact . " But some people must have an intervening membrane between object and tabletop , plaster rosettes between ceiling and chandelier , a doily under every teacup , coasters under crockery , and antimacassars between occupants ' arms and chair arms .

Many women , and even some men , define themselves by their housekeeping or cleanliness fetishes ? polishing , scrubbing , or tidying up diligently . In the housekeeping department they need to be " 10 's " all the time . Why ca n't they tolerate the sight of dirt ? " Dirt is matter out of place , " said Mary Douglas in her classic , Purity and Danger . " Dirt offends against order . " Getting rid of it is a constructive and creative endeavor to organize our surroundings . Thus , spills on the dining table , crumbs on the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing what belongs where gives us a sense of security . A New York dancer is so fastidious , he opened a house cleaning service to capitalize on his disposition . Theatrical agent Swifty Lazar is supposedly so obsessive about cleanliness , he refused to meet with client Dorothy Parker in her own house . " She was n't very tidy . " In the elegant barefoot world of Palm Beach , an obsessive Mrs. Clean has had all her furniture upholstered in white canvas . When her sockless husband falls asleep on the white chaise , she dashes to the kitchen for her bucket of suds and not so gently washes his feet and slips a towel under them . In that case , the husband seems to be matter out of place . Cleanliness is also " conspicuous morality " ? a prerequisite of respectibility . It is assumed the resident has some control over it . Of all the qualities that are valued in a residence or neighborhood , cleanliness and upkeep may be the most important , especially among people who are short on status in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but her housekeeping to speak for her . Cleaning is the way she personalizes and asserts her own and her family 's identity . " So they think at least I 'm a decent housekeeper , " said one resident of an Ithaca housing project .

But the well-to-do can be equally obsessed with their  | housekeeping . Estee Lauder " is pleased that her hardwood floors are shining , that there 's no dust on the antique side table . I love everything shiny and clean . . . it shows you care , " she told one interviewer . Cleaning can also serve a cathartic function . It takes a crisis to make some of us compulsive housekeepers .

Some people are obsessed with laundry , never allowing one family member 's clothes to be washed with another 's . Others focus on floors , kitchen counters , the inside of the refrigerator , mirrors , windowsills , toilets , or the ring around the bathtub . Some people are more fastidious in one room than another , especially parents of teenagers , who are finding it easier to condone matter out of place in their children 's rooms than to deal continually with anger out of place . But when cleaning is obsessive , it could be motivated by the repressed memory of past humiliations . Being a model housekeeper is an attempt to be perfect , because only then can one be loved .

" She remembers all too vividly her childhood when , if she forgot to make her bed , her father would strip the sheets off . When she was in a hurry to go out on a date and left clothes on her bed , her father took all the clothes out of her drawers and dumped them on the floor . She had been warned . Today , Beth is cleaner and more orderly than her parents . " I want everything perfect , " she admitted .

She is raising her kids the way she was raised . Recently , she said , she had had it with Dana . She dumped everything in one of Dana 's messy drawers on the floor and told her to fold it ; if it was n't folded right she would dump it again .

The urge to preserve , rescue , and reconstruct is basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring whole towns are all related to the need to conserve . Today , with housing prices out of sight , you can double your pleasure by saving money while salvaging a house . This twofold satisfaction has turned the urge to rescue houses into a boom activity , with close to a million people across the country involved in rehabing , restoring , and renovating ? and their ranks are increasing every day . After thirty years of married life , " said Harold Proshansky , " I realize that my wife and I are constantly engaged in a hidden practice . Every environment we pick to live in always has a lot wrong with it . We have to fix it up and change it . So I have rebuilt houses , ripped out partitions , extended bedrooms . " " I love seeing something really depressing made into something beautiful , " said British designer Jenny Hall after turning a decrepit 140-year-old house into an Architectural Digest subject . " Whenever I 've finished putting one house right , " she said , " I long to rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a missionary 's faith that the old place is worth redeeming . Restoration is part of a three-step process of " birth , death , and redemption , " said geographer J. B.  | Jackson . First there has to be a golden age , remote enough in time for us not to have any memory of it , which may account for the current rise in the popularity of Victorian ? a style that is finally sufficiently distant to inspire nostalgia . Then there has to be a period of decline and neglect . When the house has decayed sufficiently to take on a sacred quality it is ready to be rediscovered and gentrified . Some rescue operations gamer more respect than others . It is not enough to rehabilitate a house . You have to " rehab right " ( as the book of the same name advises ) . That means fixing up the house without sacrificing the sacred original architectural assets . Although lower-middle-class homeowners have been responsible for most improvements in urban housing since the late 1940s , middle-and upper-middle-class people outnumber them in rehabing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had their fill of deteriorating housing ; their dream is new housing , where the plumbing works . They do n't care to restore the past ? they want to improve on it . Their mission is better housing . Not concerned with authenticity , they " rehab wrong , " at least by the standards of the gentrifiers . Rehabing wrong means gift wrapping the house in a fake stone facade , adding elements and colors that were n't present in the original ; doing artificial restoration ? modernizing ? which may save the house but also transforms it into a new house . It may take a few decades before these houses are considered sacred vernacular architecture and worth saving . " The fellow that owns his own home is always just coming out of the hardware store , " said folk humorist Frank McKinney Hubbard over fifty years ago , and it still holds true . According to the I ) o-It-Yourself ( DIY ) Institute , more than four out of five Do-ItYourselfers are homeowners , and in 1982 for the first time more money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion to be exact . Do-It-Yourself home improvements ( home repairs and additions , painting , papering , floor laying , bathroom remodeling , lawn and garden projects ) have become such big business that more than three out of four American households did a  | major project in 1981 . Add to that all the stitching of pillows and curtains being done at home and you realize we 're not passive consumers . Many of the DIYers today are working women who could afford outside help but ca n't stay home and wait for repair people . It 's easier to do it themselves . But while a growing number of women are taking on heavy-duty chores , there are still many more men than women wielding skill saws and climbing ladders . Do-It-Yourself is the only home improvement activity in which men outnumber women . Men do 62 percent of home repairs and improvements ; and in spite of all the ladies ' garden clubs and flower-arranging courses , men do almost two-thirds of the lawn and garden work . Perhaps this accounts for the fact that when men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work they have put into them , not what they look like . Because research and observation have shown that women still make most of the style decisions and men still do most of the installations , Lowe 's , a major Do-It-Yourself chain , lays out its stores with carpet , wallpaper , lighting fixtures , vanities , and mirrors on " the women 's side , " and bulk lumber , electronics , and plywood " on the men 's side .

If we can believe a recent survey of our leisure activities , Americans spend more time gardening than making love . Perhaps that 's because gardening has something for everyone . It provides a wealth of beautiful and exotic natural materials with which to experiment and express oneself . And judging from the enormous number of members in garden clubs and begonia societies , it 's an extremely sociable endeavor , although at the same time it 's a fine way to get solitude ? even if portable telephones threaten to intrude on the tranquillity that gardens have traditionally offered .  | You can buy into this activity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you can plow a million into rearranging a few acres artfully as one gentleman landscaper is now doing in Bedford , New York . Both an outdoor and an indoor sport , gardening is a science , and an art form with a bountiful harvest of history and folklore . It is usually assumed that people garden because they like the activity of it , but there are those for whom the payoff is the end result . Beyond the joy of exchanging bulbs and know-how , getting righteous backaches and status thorn wounds , going on garden tours and finding seed catalogs in your mailbox , there is pragmatism . For those who like their activities to be productive , without too long a wait there is an abundance of parsley , sage , rosemary , and zucchini to share with neighbors ; for those who seek delight and centerpieces , there are 5,700 varieties of flowers ; and for the competitive , there are beefsteak tomato contests and specimen tree collecting .

Creating a view , replacing the tarmac or the wilderness with a planned landscape in the backyard is what motivates many other people to pick up trowel and hoe . According to one team of researchers , the attraction of plants is almost primordial , a genetic imprint dating from prehistory when vegetation was essential to human survival . Most people find green things as endlessly fascinating as fire and water and caves , although it is only since the seventeenth century when the pleasure garden , the flower garden with no other utility but beauty , superseded the garden of vegetables , spices , and 400-odd medicinal herbs . " I think of my garden as a place , not an activity , " said Rachel Kaplan who , with her husband Stephen , a psychology professor at the University of Michigan , has been studying the psychology of interest in nature . " I like to look out the window at our garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband garden not for the exercise or activity but for what they call " the content , " the end result , the garden itself . " We look on it as a park , a source of fascination . " Nature fascination accounts in large measure for the appeal of gardening , and fascination tends to increase as people move from  | growing vegetables , the first choice of the novice gardener , to flowers , the genre of the more experienced gardener . To garden successfuly requires a certain amount of technical information , but as you become more proficient , you can learn from the experience . " Keeping a garden makes you aware of how delicate , bountiful , and easily ruined the surface of this little planet is , " wrote playwright Arthur Miller . " Parsley wo n't grow in one part of the soil but loves another . " There is some indication that the fertilizer people choose may be an important clue to their attitudes about gardening . " The question is the same each year ? what method should we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have more control over their success but less pleasure , while people who use at least some organic fertilizers have less certainty but more pleasure ? a greater sense of closeness to nature . Having everything under control is not necessarily the peak experience in gardening . The thrill for many people is the tension between what you know and what you realize you have yet to learn . Demonstrating this , Arthur Miller said , " You simply have to face the moment when you must admit that the lettuce was planted too deep or was not watered enough . " There is no disputing that many people have a disposition and ability to garden , truly enjoying the experience and repeating it often . But it is questionable whether the cultivation of grass has the same motivations . The interest that neighbors take in one another 's front lawns and the embarrassment caused by weeds is fabled . The derision heaped on the lawn at the turn of the century by Thorstein Veblen , who called it a glorified cow pasture , did nothing to diminish its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Paar was the host of the " Tonight Show . " According to Chemcare , a major lawn care company , there are 25 to 30 million homes with lawns in America and their owner-caretakers , mostly Mow-It-Yourselfers , spend about $1.3 billion per year on lawn care . Why do they bother ? Because a front yard is a " national institution , " like having a Bible in the house , said J. B. Jackson . The care you give it " is an index of the taste and enterprise of the family who owns it . " And its appearance seems to be a neighborhood affair . People will put off other needs , and make sacrifices for their lawns that would seem out of proportion to their importance .  | In his study of the social meanings of suburban housing , Carl Werthman found that homeowners spent money they could barely afford and months of weekends bringing up their lawns ; failure to do so was taken by their neighbors as a sign that they did n't care what others thought of them . " Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the basis of self-respect , " lawns take on special significance . If you do n't maintain your lawn , you lose not only status but you also risk losing equity . The hidden motivation in lawn care is an attempt to maintain property values . One shaggy lawn , said Werthman , can " contaminate the status " of every home and family nearby and send resale values plummeting . Thus , the avid interest in the lawn may not be a disposition to garden as much as a disposition to be a respected citizen ? and to protect one 's nest egg . But that 's part of personality and preference , too .  | JOAN BAEDER SPENDS her days on urban safari in the jungle of executive headhunting and her nights and weekends at home in a lush suburb of Los Angeles amid hearts-and-flowers wallpaper and lacy pillow shams .

The proprietor of four shops in San Francisco , one that sells antiques , and three that are decorated with them , Lillian has put her obsession to work for her , full time .

It has been estimated that one out of every three Americans collects something . Of all the ways we acquire possessions , collecting is the most active , and it 's as much a disposition as cleaning or building or gardening . It involves gathering , discriminating , making decisions ? " I want this not that " ? and a strong sense of ownership . Collectors are constantly appraising their things ? pruning here , grafting there , reorganizing , trading up , or deaccessioning . The root of collecting is selectivity . A collector is not the same as an accumulator , who saves everything indiscriminately , or a furnisher who acquires chairs , books , cookware for everyday use . Usefulness , in the traditional sense , is rarely the goal of a collector . The collection is a special entity with its own natural order and raison d'etre . I " Three of anything is a collection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a collection , the items collected must have some similarity and interrelationship . By being part of the  | collection , each piece is transformed from its original function of toy , icon , bowl , picture , whatever , into an object with new meaning ? a member of an assemblage that is greater than the sum of its parts . Motivations for collecting have been variously described as curiosity , compulsion , competitiveness , delight in discovery , nostalgia , ancestor worship , miserliness , a reaction to a complex world , anal erotism , and instinct . " I 'm a compulsive saver ; it must stem from an insecure childhood , " wrote one woman in response to an article on compulsive collecting . " Most of us collect for profit , " said a New York Times reporter . " Money is out , things are in , " said another journalist . " There are just three reasons for collecting ? and always have been , " observed critic Russell Lynes : " love , greed , and ambition . " Does anyone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting ? Lita Furby , a psychologist , has done a major survey of the literature on " possession , " and a number of studies of people and things . One of the problems in studying collecting , said Furby , is that you ca n't do it in a laboratory with standard methods . It is hard to establish simple cause-and-effect relationships when collecting is so tangled up with an individual 's personal and social history . How much weight should a researcher give to the fact that Joan Baeder was praised often by her ex-husband , an artist , for her " eye for beauty " ? Is it significant that Dolph Gotelli learned very young that there was no Santa Claus ? And how relevant is it that Lillian Williams talks about her collecting ? " the tracking , stalking , and haunting , " of the past ? with the same words she uses to describe going hunting with her father when she was a child ? Most of the theorizing about collecting done in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries leaned heavily on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his autobiography that his own interest in naming plants and collecting coins , shells , seals , franks , and minerals was well developed by age eight , and he concluded his leaning was " innate " ? inborn , not bred . The instinct to collect was thought to be related to the animal  | instinct for hoarding food . But most animals do n't hoard yearround . They hoard food in winter when it is scarce in order to survive . How could the mania for stamp collecting , which swept the world after the introduction of prepaid postage in England in 1840 , be related to chipmunks stuffing seeds in their cheek pouches , squirrels burying nuts in the forest , and bears , wolves , and foxes stashing away food , or a leopard hanging a carcass in a tree for a month of snacking ? Surely the survival instinct had nothing to do with the ad placed in The Times of London in 1841 : a woman wanted enough canceled stamps to paper her dressing room . How many letters could she mail with a roomful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gotten from those stamps as there is nourishment in millionaire Malcolm Forbes 's collection of Faberge eggs . One turn-of-the century psychologist linked collecting to the impulse to construct that is found in many birds and rodents . Bowerbirds may be the most prodigious and tasteful collectorbuilders in the animal world . Each species is identified by its particular color preference ? for red , white , black , or pink ? in construction materials . But can you really compare a bowerbird to the early birds who catch the worm-eaten antiques at flea markets ? The bowerbird 's collecting activity is genetically built in . It 's a very purposeful mating game assuring the perpetuation of the species . In 1900 , Caroline Burk , an educational psychologist , was certain she had proved an instinct for collecting , based on a study of more than 1,200 California children . She found that all but 10 percent of them collected something , from cigar bands to rocks , leaves , marbles , and buttons . Burk counted 300 different types of collections . One boy alone had fifty-five collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her theory was cited and recited whenever collecting was discussed . Not until 1927 was the instinct for collecting debunked by a newer study which found a sizable decrease in children 's collecting activity from Burk 's day . During the intervening years , a number of pursuits , including the movies , had come along to vie for young people 's attention . If instinct was t he root of collecting , would n't there be as much collecting among children in the 1920s as there was in 1900 ? Perhaps collecting was n't instinctive at all , but a socially stimulated activity . Meanwhile , Freud linked the impulse to gather , collect , and  | hoard to the child 's fascination with its bodily wastes . In the Freudian view , a child moves from the pleasure it gets from its excretions and the power it gets from holding them back , through a stage of repression and disgust in the name of cleanliness , to playing with mud ? sanitized excreta ? and then with sand and putty . When pebbles , marbles , buttons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he reasoned , a collector is born . If the collector graduates to the next phase ? hoarding bright , shiny coins ? the evolution to miser is complete . Thus , according to Freudian scholar Ernest Jones , " all collectors are anal erotics , and the objects collected are nearly always typical copro-symbols " ? symbols of feces . Very interesting , said Ernest Beaglehole , author of the 1932 classic , Property : A Study in Social Psychology . He found Freud 's theory of anal erotism ingenious ? but unproven . And he did n't buy the instinct theory either . He did n't think instinct explained collecting any more than instinct explained the mania for crossword puzzles that preoccupied Americans during the winter of 1923-1924 . No , Beaglehole had another theory . Grasping , he said , is the germ of acquisitive behavior . The impulse to grasp objects is in the service of nutrition . The infant 's first focus is the mother 's breast or the bottle . Growing curiosity and interest lead the child to pay attention to almost anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is imitation and suggestion that lead a child into the " habit complex " called collecting . Grasping is instinctive , but collecting is a culturally determined activity . It is stimulated , reasoned Beaglehole , " by rivalry , by the desire for that admiration and approval lavished upon the child with better and more complete collections than his fellows ? by the desire to achieve , to exploit , to gain superiority and power which is only the reverse side of social approval . " Through collections , said Beaglehole , " we taste the joys of superiority , power , and selfesteem . " But what about love ? Over and over again we read articles attributing collecting to love ? the chemical attraction between collectors and the objects of their desire . " Blind love seems to be the tie that binds collectors together , " said one writer . " It 's like , well , having a love affair , " said another .  | Saying that love is what draws collectors to their collectibles " is no better than saying people eat food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphrey believes he has found a biological basis for collecting that is very similar to bird watching or what the English call " locospotting " ? the habit of collecting observations . Birds , plants , license plates , airplanes , and pub signs all have their dedicated spotters who risk life , limb , and pocketbook to collect observations , just as collectors go out on a limb for objects . Despite the emphasis on accumulation and ownership in collecting , said Humphrey , the real thrill of collecting is in the spotting and classifying . He believes that instead of being an innate tendency to acquire objects , collecting is an adaptive tendency to classify the environment . " Biologists generally assume that most behavior patterns they observe in animals are functional , " he wrote . " The traits necessary to be a good collector were once traits necessary for survival . " Whether they use the sense of smell or sight , or a combination , " Animals that devised precise methods of classification and enjoyed classifying became good candidates for survival because when they recognized objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classify , they had to be able to distinguish essential characteristics . Many humans have highly developed senses of observation , too . " Collectors of objects as well as collectors of observations are in it not for the material satisfaction but for the mental thrill it gives them . . . . They search for , and value , differences , " said Humphrey . Owning satisfies the ego , but classifying is its own reward , like solving a puzzle or doing a difficult mental exercise . You can spot the spotters ? they always talk about noticing minute differences that helped them select their prizes . Invariably , the eye is mentioned . " I have a tardy eye , " said one collector , describing how it took a little while for her to get used to 1980s art . " My eye , uncontrollable , is constantly reconnoitering the terrain for any bit of blue and white , Celadon , monochrome , " said journalist Bernard Kalb , a Chinese porcelain enthusiast , writing about his " endless affair with my own femme fatale , Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , like infants who delight in discovering stimuli that are different , but only slightly , from what they know , collectors get their biggest kicks from seeing new variations on familiar themes . A Santa slightly different from the thousands of Santas he already owns is what Dolph Gotelli looks for on his search and acquire missions to thrift shops , antiques stores , and flea markets all over the world . In a remote London doll museum he spotted his most prized piece , a " nodder , " a hundred-year-old wind-up Santa that nods its head . While scanning the crowded shop he made eye contact with the rarity that had eluded him for years ? there it was on a high shelf . How did he notice it ? By using the same highly developed discriminatory powers that an elephant uses to spot its favorite berries on the mukaita tree , that the koala uses to spot eucalyptus leaves , and that vegetarian animals use to select out their preferred grasses , shoots , barks , leaves , seeds , fungi , and lichens . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had known . Spotting has always been important to human survival . In landscapes that might appear empty or monotonous to outsiders , pastoralists and aborigines are extremely sensitive to minute differences in vegetation , animal tracks , , and signs of human presence . For them , said Amos Rapoport , " the empty ' landscape becomes very rich . " These same powers of observation can be called into service by a collector to distinguish delft from Staffordshire , Hepplewhite from Sheraton , a Ghiordes prayer rug from a Ladik , and better than that , to outwit the professionals . Spotting something first , or spotting what others have overlooked , is one of the peak experiences of collecting . A good eye helps in this , but so does the ability to put two and two together . There is more than luck involved in being in the right place at the right time . Most collectors do not stumble on their prizes by chance . Being able to predict the best fields for grazing , the direction the birds are flying , is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , intuition , the ability to make connections , and a keen intelligence , which may well be the most important trait of a collector . In fact , a study of young collectors showed that the more intelligent the children , the more collections they had .

The painting seemed too unbalanced to be the work of a master . But Hammer had a hunch that the work was authentic and did some research on its provenance . It seemed unlikely to him that John D. Rockefeller , its former owner , and a man with capable art advisers , would have bought a fake . So Hammer " stole " the picture for a mere $2,700 at auction . After some restoration work , it was discovered that the painting was unbalanced because a third child had been painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section was restored , " one of the great Lawrences of all time " was revealed . A major difference among collectors is whether they collect for completion or for repetition . For some collectors getting a complete set of something is a major motivation . Once the set is rounded out , it is auctioned off or donated it to a museum . Francis Garvan , one of the great Americana collectors , asked his agent to make a list of every major piece of American furniture , silver , pewter , brass , iron , and china so he could go after them one by one . He eventually gave the collection , which took twenty years to acquire , to Yale . Ryohei Ishikawa recently won a big prize in philately for putting together what is , in the words of one collector , " the most phenomenal collection of stamps in U.S. history . " Then he promptly sold his collection . The search was over . It was time to embark on a new pursuit . Success after a long quest can be a terrible letdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit Williams 's Masquerade followed clues and dug holes all over the British Isles in search of the jeweled rabbit buried by the author . " I felt right dejected , " said the man who finally found it . " It was all over . There was nothing to live for . " Finding the final object is a kind of death for the collector , said Jean Baudrillard . It 's the end of passion . " Let us congratulate the person who does not find the last piece , " he said . The beauty of many collections is their open-endedness . The series is never complete ? like a harem , said Baudrillard . And the  | collector is " the master of the secret seraglio , " at home in " the bosom of his objects . " There is always another prize to be found , giving each successive conquest an addictive quality . " I 'm a compulsive buyer , " explained New York designer Robert Metzger , who collects objects covered in scaly shagreen ? untanned sharkskin in washed-out greens , blues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I see a piece I like I feel a tremendous sense of excitement , " said Metzger . " I have to have it . Buying it makes my day . I bring it home and put it on my night table . The next day , I look at it a lot . Then I put it in my curio cabinet . It takes another day before I lose interest in it . " And the hunt starts all over again . There are always more hunters than desirable prey and so the competition can be quite vicious . But often the ruthless traders who delight in outwitting one another , who , as Bernard Kalb described , " have lied and cheated to throw a competitor off the scent " of a vase , have nurturing instincts , too , believing it 's their mission to save and preserve objects and ways of life . The goal is not to possess , but to rescue . It was partly the urge to preserve that motivated private collectors such as Henry Ford , John D. Rockefeller , Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the way in preserving Americana and interesting museums in historic preservation . " I 'm a rescue service , " said Lillian Williams . " It is gratifying to find things in disrepair and then breathe life into them . I am a custodian . I have an obligation to restore things and put them in good hands . " Whether or not she gets pleasure from rescuing because she still feels remorse for breaking one of her mother 's antique dolls when she was five , she does n't feel like the owner of her things , just the conservator . " I have chairs that are demented and twisted and broken and legless and armless and they 've all been restored because my husband and I are fanatical about restoring things . And restoring them correctly . . . . I am always desperate to find homes for my things ; they 're orphans , abandoned , lost . And our house is the orphanage . " Should a museum send out an SOS for eighteenth-century ainioires , lits a la Polonaise , harpsichords , candelabra , bonnets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Lillian , she would gladly donate her booty and start all over .  | The repetitive aspect of collecting is , like all compulsions , a way of feeling in control . " Everyone tries to develop programs to control life . Some are built in . Some are habit , " said Swedish psychologist Rikard Kuller . " Collecting is imposing your will . I must choose , I must control , I must collect . I must have that object . ' By buying it , it is in your possession . Like compulsive eating . The basic mechanism , " no matter what you collect , he said , " is an attempt to control anxiety . " If the ability to control an object is , as Lita Furby believes , the " central defining dimension of possession , " controlling a whole set of things should be even more satisfying . " You feel insecure , you do n't have control , so you amass a whole bunch of something and feel secure , " she said . The control you have over your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household things . It 's more total . Designating a possession as part of a collection changes it from an object that anyone in the family can use to an object of value in the collector 's exclusive jurisdiction . By calling your six flower prints a collection , you build a protective wall around them . Would your sister-in-law expect you to give her a print to hang in her guest room if it were part of The Collection ? Children may have to share their toys , and pass their clothes down to younger siblings , but what unfeeling parent would require a child to share a glass animal from The Collection ? A pebble in a collection is no longer an ordinary pebble but the special pink pebble , and in the transformation process the object is beatified . The collector decides who may touch The Collection and how it will be displayed . The collector decides when , if ever , coffee will be served in the cups and saucers from The Collection . Objects that would be inconsequential separately become powerful in a group . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of The Collection . When it is on loan , it is on loan from " the collection of ... " But where there is power , there are power struggles . Many collections , especially those based on kitsch objects that are n't  | costly , are susceptible to outside intervention . Julia , for instance , collects artifacts decorated with American flag imagery . Julia 's friends know that she collects Stars and Stripes . When they visit antiques stores and see a mug or cigar band with Old Glory screened on it , they think , " Julia would like that . " If it is n't too expensive , they 'll buy it and give it to her on her birthday , which is , not coincidentally , the Fourth of July . And occasionally it does please her . But Julia , like most collectors , can manage very nicely , thank you , without the intervention of a deus ex machina swooping in with some undiscriminating addition to her collection . Not that she 's against sentiment . It 's nice to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own selections . Butting in on another person 's collection is like looking over the shoulder of a crossword puzzle aficionado and suggesting the answer to 23-across without being asked for help . The reason some collectors resent these intrusions is that they enjoy the fishing as much as the catching ; the foreplay as much as the consummation . Searching , spotting , inspecting , comparing , bidding , and bagging the kill are all part of the joy of collecting . Receiving the object of your dreams as a bequest , without the quest , short-circuits the pleasure . The circumstances of discovery can also affect the pleasure . Certain collectors prefer buried treasures to easily found ones . Sally , a Boston collector of Americana , is admittedly " dying for a pair of Ammi Phillips portraits , really good ones . " Phillips was an itinerant painter in the early nineteenth century . Would it make any difference to Sally whether she found the paintings on her doorstep ? as a gift from a benefactor ? or discovered them herself ? " Oh , there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on your doorstep the whole discovery syndrome would n't be there . Having them handed to you takes the fun out . But if I found two of them in an antiques shop , I think I 'd go out of my mind . I 'd like to find them covered with dust in a little back road shop with an old man , chewing tobacco , minding the store . The fact that I had discovered them off the beaten track rather than on Madison Avenue would be thrilling . " Even collectors who have advisers do n't like anything acquired for them without their approval . Winterthur 's Henry Francis du Pont had a valued adviser but was still known as " a personal purchaser " who scrutinized every prospective acquisition .  | Because personal involvement is so important to collectors , they can rarely bond to inherited collections or collections acquired passively , as gifts , with the same intensity as collections acquired actively , by choice . Bill Blass found a saltshaker in the shape of an owl while stationed in England during the Second World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years friends who did n't know what to give the man who seemed to have everything gave him some 500 owls as gifts . " It got to the point where it was sickening , " said Blass . " It got out of hand . The only thing to do was to give them all away and keep the original . " Other " involuntary collectors " are equally unenthusiastic about their passively acquired collections . A woman who could n't stem the tide of gift frogs admitted being ambivalent about them ; a man who amassed sixty penguins as gifts said , " It 's a good time to call it quits . " The gift owl or frog or penguin bonds the recipient to the donor with ties of gratitude , but not necessarily to the owl or frog or penguin . What keeps people involved in their collections is the reinforcement and camaraderie they get from being a member of the collectors club . The sociability factor in collecting is greatly underrated . The fields of endeavor that hook people and keep them hooked are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its auctions , fairs , markets , conventions , exhibitions , guidebooks , lectures , and home-study courses ? can hold its own with politics or sports as an all-consuming organizing system for one 's life . Whether you pursue art or antiques , are a flea market follower or a collector of political memorabilia , there is a social circuit exclusive to your collection . And , frankly , being the conservator of a unique music box collection or the largest collection of souvenir state capital plates can be as effective in striking up a conversation as two Russian wolfhounds on a leash . The right collection , like the right dog , is an entree to people you would not ordinarily meet . American antiques buffs can ladle punch from a Paul Revere howl at Winterthur 's annual Twelfth Night Gala . Art pottery collectors get together once a year at the Holiday Inn in Zanesville , Ohio , for the American Art Pottery Association convention . Dolph  | Gotelli and other Santa collectors hold regular " Santa Summits . " Lillian Williams and her husband Teddy are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who all dress in period clothes . Sally , the folk art collector , attends the major folk art shows in Houston , New York , Philadelphia , and York , Pennsylvania . She and her husband spend summer weekends at country auctions . They even send their children to camp in Maine so they can antique on the way up to attend Visiting Day , always stopping in to see their special " picker , " a dealer who supplies other dealers . Robert Bechtel , a psychology professor at the University of Arizona , not only collects Arizona postmarks but also studies their history , gives lectures , attends meetings , leads expeditions to find lost towns ? all on the trail of postmarks . The activities related to the collection are so engrossing that to stop collecting would be like relocating or retiring ? one would be cut off from a whole constellation of events and friendships . " Our world is filled with exciting , stimulating , intellectual people , " said one art collector . " If I stopped collecting , I 'd grow old quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one collector is said to have done , is not required to prove your dedication , art collecting can be a total way of life requiring you to put your taste on the line . If a controversial field like modern art is your enthusiasm , your selections can alienate your friends and relatives , even your friend at the bank . But there are rewards . Modern art , if played to the hilt , can keep a collector 's Museum of Modern Art calendar filled seven days a week . Time spent tracking down and making the purchase is just a fraction of the time spent living la vie en art . The language must be studied and vocabulary built . Collecting art is never again having to worry about making conversation at a party . " What do ordinary people talk about ? " wondered one art collector who talks art on visits to artists ' studios , at vernissages , preopening dinners , postopening soirees ? and on the analyst 's couch . Speaking the language badly is the tipoff to people in the field about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art as " avant-garde " or " tough " ? decidedly retro language ? and ask " Where are the loft parties ? " they might as well turn in their Rauschenberg lithos and go back to buying LeRoy Neiman posters . They will not make it in the hardknock world of modern art collecting . This is a milieu built on  | scholarship . But do n't let that worry you ; getting your course credit is more fun than Christmas in Fort Lauderdale . Basic training in collecting requires steeping yourself in specialty magazines and participating in the ritual Tuesday evening openings and Saturday afternoon gallery walk-a-thons . Experts encourage beginning collectors to study before buying . They want you to send your eye to college , so to speak . " Spend your initial funds . . . on books and travel , " said one media adviser . Then , a small starter purchase of a drawing , getting on gallery mailing lists , and becoming " a friend " of a few museums will plug you right in to art collecting 's social network . Recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art community does its best to develop collectors by enticing them with prepackaged art-and-camaraderie experiences . In 1981 , fifty people were invited by New York 's New Museum ( an exhibition space catering to art so new the paint has hardly dried ) to put some fun in their lives by joining Art Quest : A Contemporary Collectors Forum . The $1,000 membership fee entitled members to ten meetings a year , six at the homes of other collectors ; at least four special days of visits to artists ' studios with curators present to discuss the artists ' work ; meetings with artists , critics , museum people ; a tip sheet on hot exhibits ; discounts on art , membership , and admission fees ; a chance to buy limited edition prints available only to members ; and a hot line to an art expert for advice . After all this grounding , it 's your eye , scholarship , shrewdness , devotion , charisma , and attendance record that will carry you along . Even if you missed the Jackson Pollack opening at the Beaubourg in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Vatican , the recent Documenta show in Kassel , West Germany , the Zeitgeist in Berlin , and the unfurling of Christo 's outer island project in Miami , you can still get in on the upcoming salute to U.S. art in Lucerne , the Venice Biennale , or take a trip down the Nile with a Harvard guide . " Collecting is a richer context for travel , " said dealer Holly Solomon . " It gives you an international family . " Wherever you go there are important collectors and dealers to visit ? people who will not only show you their etchings but also offer advice on the best doctors and the best tortellini . One of the satisfactions of the art trail is hobnobbing with artists . If you become friendly enough ,  | you might receive a painting for your birthday . This might be the only gift of art a collector would welcome , and a fairly rare one . While the social aspect of collecting has its satisfactions , the end product of all this looking and learning is taking possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the things you collect . The " decorating factor , " as art historian Joseph Alsop called it , is very much an issue in collecting . Should you or should n't you use a collection as an element of decor ? The collectors who have been derided the most on the art circuit are the ones who choose paintings as if they were wallpaper ? to match a color scheme . Actually , there is a long tradition of using collections as decor , at least in the West . In the East , during the high period of Chinese art , a collector would n't think of using his prized works of calligraphy to decorate his interiors . Collections were for the owner 's delight or to show other collectors ? treasures to be put away and protected . In the West , however , the tradition has been , if you 've got it , flaunt it . Collections have been used as decor since the very beginning of art collecting in the fourth and fifth centuries B.C. In Greece and Rome , collectors were not above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their houses . Today collectors buy according to the height and length of their walls and the dimensions of the elevators in their apartment houses . The obsession with housing the collection dates back to the seventeenth century , when having a collection signified that one had leisure , arcane knowledge , and money ? the marks of a true gentleman . But virtuosos and dilettanti , as collectors were called , needed places to display and store their curiosities ? the sharks ' teeth , stuffed serpents , amulets , carved cherry pits , books , inkwells , mathematical instruments , medals , and portraits . As the enthusiasm for collecting caught on , new types of rooms and furnishings ? libraries , tribunes , galleries , cabinets , and vitrineswere invented to house them . Creating an appropriate setting for the collection has always been of paramount interest to the collector . In the decorating scheme , The Collection is the favorite child , the guest of honor , the teacher 's pet .  | One Victoriana collector in the Midwest admits hunting for months for a condominium with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He finally settled for a place with a high-ceilinged stair landing to accommodate the piece . In California , a couple added a gallery to their house for their burgeoning collections . In Houston , collectors built platforms on two opposite ends of their large living room as display areas for their collection of French eighteenth-century marquetry chests . In BelAir , California , the Bob Newharts had cabinets designed to order for their Steuben glass collection , which started with a gift from Ethel Kennedy . And all over the country , collectors are shopping for proper cabinets for The Collection ? or having them made . Sometimes it seems as if the people profiting the most from the collecting boom are the cabinetmakers . In New Orleans , the Manheim Galleries has created a ten-foot-long Chinese Chippendalestyle breakfront that can be custom tailored to house as many as thirty-six Boehm birds . It retails for a mere $17,000 . The biggest enchilada , storage-wise , is the modern painting or sculpture , which can be as demanding a family member as any intransigent relative . In the 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory in SoHo 's wide-open industrial spaces , paintings started expanding in all directions like rolled out pizza dough . To be a modern art collector required space . One had to renovate or move . Ben Heller was in the forefront of renovationfor-art 's sake when he knocked out a wall in his apartment to make room for Jackson Pollock 's Blue Poles . " It 's ironic , " said one decorator , " you can buy a million dollar apartment on Park Avenue , and still end up with only two fourteen-foot-long walls and one twentyfive-foot one . " Even though houses are shrinking , the dimensions of paintings continue to expand ? especially the third dimension . Modern paintings are now pregnant with depth . When New York collectors Eugene and Barbara Schwartz bought Julian Schnable 's " aggressive " painting with antler horns that protrude two and a half feet from the canvas , they were hard pressed to find a spot to hang it where someone walking by would n't be decapitated . The only spot in their apartment with enough clearance was opposite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I go to the closet , " Barbara Schwartz laughed . And a large percentage of interior design work seems to be a response to the challenge of creating " a background  | for art , " a favorite phrase in house tour brochures . Sometimes it seems that collectors are more interested in housing The Collection than the family . People will move to find the right space for The Collection ; they will enlarge the house by three feet if necessary for The Collection ; they will sacrifice a closet to make space for an item in The Collection as one prominent Chicago collector did ( " That is the epitome of loving art , " remarked one Philadelphia woman on a private tour of Chicago collectors ' homes ) ; and they will spend thousands to relocate light switches and thermostats , and install special lighting for The Collection . California architect Barry Berkus has received notoriety of late as a builder of housing for mingles . But for himself and his family , he has built a palatial modern house in Santa Barbara to share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaulted ceilings , swooping skylights , and interior balconies suitable for a Pope 's appearances all give the house museum scale . " I designed the proportions of the house for the proportions of the paintings , " said Berkus . Once collectors give their art a suitable architectural hangar , they tend , as the Berkuses do , to open the house up on tours . It 's like living in a museum . It puts you in the same league with such personal museum founders as Malcolm Forbes , Norton Simon , Rodin collector B. G. Cantor , Duncan Phillips of the Phillips Collection , and Roy and Dale Evans , who have made their silver saddles , gun collection , and stuffed horse , Trigger , available to the public . " A museum of one 's own , " said Town &; Country , " for the impassioned collector , this is the crowning coup , the ultimate status , the surest collaboration with immortality . " You ca n't talk about collecting without mentioning status . Collections have been status vehicles for centuries . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? posters , prints , paintings ? are the most class related . The University of Chicago study on The Meaning of Things found that upper-middle-class people were almost three times as likely as lower-middle-class people to cherish a work of art ? whether expensive or inexpensive . Perhaps , said the researchers , this is because art has filtered down from churches  | and palaces to bourgeois homes as " symbols of affluence and sensitivity . " Even Sotheby 's is n't above hyping its sales with a reminder that collecting and status go together like love and marriage . In Victorian times , etageres , clock garnitures , bronzes , and silver tea services all " attested to the buying power of the owner , " said a Sotheby 's newsletter . The status game is still played with collections , although each collector may insist he or she is in it for noble motives while everyone else is collecting for status . It is obvious that status accrues to collections just as status accrues to people , through money . The most expensive collections and collectibles have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its rarity , condition , and beauty , the demand for it , and the status of the people who own it . It does not detract from the meaning of collecting , said psychologist Walter Durost , " to admit that it may also serve other uses " ? whether collecting helps one feel more powerful or whether it provides recognition one would n't otherwise be able to achieve . " Most collectors , especially those with new money , are in it for self-aggrandizement , " said one jaded New York decorator who has had a hand in improving his clients ' collections . Young doctors and lawyers change their collections as their situation improves , he said . " They start with Rhine wineglasses , move on to Doughty birds , and finally graduate to blanc de Chine ? white Chinese porcelain . " In certain social sets , people who do n't collect feel intimidated by those who do . " I feel pressured to collect , " said a New York woman . " All my friends collect . It 's one of the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment and it looks good when you entertain ? you can talk about your collection . " If your collection is large enough , you can invite the museum curator of porcelain or prints or Far Eastern art to dinner to discuss your collection and , one hopes , pronounce it worthy . Even the Philadelphia osteopath who stole his whole collection of small-scale art could n't resist inviting a curator from the Philadelphia Museum of Art for cocktails . He risked being found out for the thrill of impressing someone not easily impressed . One index of the social capital in a collection is the amount of inconvenience a collector will endure for the sake of it . In tribal Africa the status that accrues from a collection outweighs the discomfort of living with an overgrown inventory . In the African town  | of Sabo , the married women are ardent collectors of the brightly colored , enameled metal bowls made in Czechoslovakia . All businesswomen , they sink most of their profits from catering into amassing bowl collections , said anthropologist Abner Cohen . " These bowls have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status in proportion to the number of bowls they possess , " he said . Some women have amassed hundreds of them which they wash and rearrange carefully in tall columns when they are expecting honored guests . " Space is scarce in Sabo , " said Cohen , " and husbands are greatly annoyed by the mountains of bowls . " The typical complaint , he said , is that " because of the bowls , a man can not nowadays find space in his wife 's room for even his morning prayers . " But the women keep collecting because of the power they get from their bowl collections . The more bowls a woman accumulates , the more marriageable girls she will be able to attract to work in her business in return for a dowry of bowls when they marry . Just as collectors deny collecting for status , they also deny collecting for money , although money is never far from their minds . Collecting , like gambling , can break a person . Painter James McNeill Whistler went bankrupt buying Chinese porcelains . But collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pragmatic level , collecting is a way of feeling in control of the future , economically . Would n't you sleep better knowing your Chinese scrolls had been steadily rising in value since you started acquiring them ; that the Grueby vase you paid $15 for at the church auction could be sold for $6,000 ? Collections are money in the bank ? or the breakfront . This fact has not escaped one couple who are active in Philadelphia museum circles . They were the talk of the New York art circuit recently when , apparently eager to indoctrinate their children , age thirteen to twenty-four , into the pleasures of picking art and profiting from it , they took them to New York for a long weekend of intensive art immersion . After gallery visits , treks to artists ' studios , dinners with art aficionados , and the advice of consultants , each child was given an equally generous sum of money  | to spend as he or she pleased . In five years , so the story goes , the children will be rewarded according to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring that they do n't collect for money . " By and large , today 's collectors do not choose their acquisitions for their potential increase in value through the years , " said one journalist . " If they do appreciate , their owners say , it is a bonus . " If collectors do n't think about value , why are they constantly pricing their things ; and what accounts for the phenomenal success of the price guides that tell people the market value of various collectibles ? Do people study these guides only to learn how to recognize a steal when one is offered to them ? Sally , the folk art collector , does n't deny the profit potential of her hobby . " I love the products of our collecting . I like adding new things . I only buy what appeals visually . It 's exciting looking , making judgments . There 's also the element of chance ? like at the roulette table , one day you 'll hit a winner . " A winner ? " We constantly check the values , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see whether what we have is going up or going down . We never sell . But you know you could if you had to . Having made a good choice is thrilling . When something becomes valuable , you feel you made the right judgment . You spotted something that no one appreciated and then it went up in value . " Never for a second did director Billy Wilder think of collecting as a hedge against inflation . " I do n't want to sell it ? do you sell your dog ? " asked Wilder . If he did n't think about value , why did he reduce his collection of pre-Columbian art to his ten finest pieces ? Why not his ten favorite pieces ? But not every buy is a good buy , a ticket to the collectors ' pantheon . Early purchases made more from enthusiasm than from expertise can be embarrassments when one learns the fine points of a field . Condition , quality , rarity , and authenticity are constantly being assessed . The moment it is discovered that the beloved object is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be valued in the same way it was originally . What was deemed exquisite yesterday is suddenly homely . Unless appropriate measures are taken , the devalued item threatens to devalue the owner as well . Collectors must distance themselves from lesser pieces by disposing of them or disavowing them , announcing they are being retained in the collection for sentimental reasons . Reminiscing  | about the first piece of porcelain he ever bought , Bernard Kalb spoke of the disenchantment that came with his increased scholarship . " Occasionally I look at that vase and wonder how it could have aroused such lust . Now , I regard it affectionately as my ugly duckling . " As they demote their bad choices they promote their good ones , moving them to better positions in the house . There is more involved here than the satisfaction of having had 20/20 art vision . The value of a painting or object is of paramount interest to collectors not because they plan to sell it immediately , but precisely because they plan to keep it . An item 's value is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating measures how recognizable a TV star is , or a Dun &; Bradstreet measures how solid a business is . The higher the value of the object , the more honorable the collector . Raina , a California art collector , is not unaware that her painting collection has been steadily rising in value . On Raina 's coffee table is a thick and glossy book on New Realist painting . In the book are four paintings in Raina and Norman 's collection . " We bought these works of art when the artists were unknown . Now ten of our paintings are pictured in different art books . It 's fun because somebody who knows is saying that these artists made it . It affirms the fact that you had an insight , that you had a sense of taste in art or a sense of vision . You are a creator in your own right . I mean the artist is a creator , but the collector is a creator , too . " As Jean Baudrillard said in his essay on the art auction , the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equal of the canvas itself ' and a peer in the community of the privileged . Art creates not profit but legitimacy , " and it is with this that the art lover identifies . "  | N0 ONE BUT the telephone man and landlady has ever set foot in the apartment of one otherwise gregarious New Yorker . Not even his best friend has seen it in the six years he has lived there . He suffers from an exotic syndrome that has no research funding and no celebrity benefit committee ? fear of furnishing . People with this problem find it more satisfying to picture a penthouse than to risk botching it or having it fall short of their own expectations . The more severe their need to succeed , the less likely they are to start . " It 's a matter of not lowering your standards , " said Carson , a thirty-two  - -  year- old hairdresser . " My father taught me never to buy things I could n't afford and my mother taught me to be a perfectionist about my possessions . I know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford it , I wo n't settle for less . " A Westchester woman suffers from one of the most severe and prolonged cases of fear of furnishing . Hundreds of jonquils are beginning to bloom in the borders around Natalie and Harvey 's five-bedroom custom contemporary . But inside the house , the living room is almost empty . Natalie and Harvey have been seeing a marriage counselor for some time . The problem is not sex or  | money or in-laws ? the problem is furniture . For seven years Natalie has been unable to make any but the most makeshift decorating decisions in the living room and dining room . It would be easier to understand if Harvey , an amiable and successful insurance man , was difficult to please or tight with money . Or if Natalie was n't a decorator . " My mother says it 's a disgrace . I can order a whole house from bar cart to soup to nuts for a client , but for myself , I ca n't even choose a rug .

She said , You 're going to thank me in March . ' And she was right . They 're beautiful , " said Natalie . " But I ca n't help thinking , it would have been nice if I had done it myself . " The house still needs much more . It 's not comfortable . It 's not warm . Harvey wants to know when we 'll be able to invite people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends ' homes and he wants to reciprocate . He does n't care what style I do it in . He just wants it furnished . " To keep from making any decorating decisions , Natalie has developed a new habit of shopping in places that sell things she ca n't possibly afford . " I make sure I 'm not even in my price range . " Every once in a while it appears that Natalie is on the verge of a breakthrough . She 'll say , " I know I should give up this idea that I have to be so perfect . Maybe I should swallow my pride and hire a decorator . Just to get it done . But , who would I pick ? That means I 've got to make another decision . " This is odd . While so many people are talking about decorating , the personally conducted tour of the house has gone the way of the five-cent cup of coffee . Wherever you go , you hear : " I 'd love to invite you to dinner but the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a foot in the door , you 're invariably told , " Do n't look . It 's not done yet . " So you avert your eyes . What 's the big deal if the living room has no rug , the sofa has seen better days , and the dining room is furnished with a card table and folding chairs ? They function , do n't they ? That depends on how you define function . Since meaning is an aspect of function , certain connotations can make an object dysfunctional . And the meanings of tattered furniture and folding furniture are all wrong . When people present themselves before  | others , said Erving Gofftnan , their performances " will tend to incorporate and exemplify the officially accredited values of the society . " Anyone who has attended enough theatrical performances knows that the bare stage look is usually a workshop production . Did you ever see a sign in a model room that said , " Crystal chandelier coming when we can afford it " ? Examples of **32;2036;TOOLONG spaces shown in model rooms and home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that comes through strongest is " It 's necessary to be finished . " For some people , finished is when there is no longer a pile of sawdust in the middle of the room ; for others , finished is when the major furniture bills are paid and they can start taking vacations again ; and for still others , finished is when they work in the room instead of on it . But for almost everyone , finished is a euphemism for right ? the way it ought to be . To be " finished " is to be ready to be judged by those people whose approval matters ? the boss , a client , or new friends . As one woman who was in the midst of an endless renovation said , " I can have people to dinner , but I ca n't have a serious dinner party . " This is not frivolous materialism . Her embarrassment comes from an understanding of the rules of the social game in our society . Maintaining a proper front is a role requirement here . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how he conducts himself , he is still a prince . But in an open society , you have to show an interest in your status and " give a clue that the status is being maintained , " said sociologist Martin Weglinsky . A home furnished in keeping with one 's " position " is such a clue . And if you do n't measure up , you are embarrassed , exposed , as if you and your rooms were undressed . Entertaining in an empty room is not measuring up to role requirements in the middle or upper middle class . " If I like people , I do n't care if they are living with orange crates , " said one fully furnished designer , democratically . But if the people living with those crates believe they should be living with teak casegoods , the forgiveness of others feels like condescension . For many reasons , it is rare these days for homes to be ready for inspection and , therefore , embarrassment seems to be rampant . Getting on with one 's furnishing has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? with one 's assessment of job security , future  | earning power , and life expectancy . A widow in her seventies saw no hope for improvement in earnings and could n't imagine living long enough to get her money 's worth out of chairs she needed badly , so she refused to buy any . Not until she celebrated her eightieth birthday in good health did she have sufficent faith in her future to make the investment . Feelings of mortality can strike the young as well . A Los Angeles film producer could n't bring herself to invest in decorating her home until she passed her thirty-eighth birthday . Her mother had died at that age and she had a superstitious fear that she , too , would die at thirty-eight . Only after that birthday could she make a commitment to fixing up her home . Some people do n't start or finish personalizing because they lack commitment to a relationship , a neighborhood , a job , or a dwelling . Often they do n't even realize that they are in a commitment crisis . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , how to prove it ? Not in a laboratory . They chose a college dorm instead . Where else can you find forty blank decorating slates ? During the second week of the fall semester and again nine weeks later , the researchers detailed how forty-one pairs of freshman roommates in a men 's dorm at the University of Utah " personalized " their rooms ? classifying , counting , and photographing the walls over each student 's bed . Nothing escaped the researchers ' scrutiny . Snapshots of a student 's girl friend and family , peace posters , religious pictures , political cartoons , pictures of sunsets and art reproductions , Playboy centerfolds , Dylan posters , sports posters , calendars , clocks , radios , stereos , campus maps , film society schedules , skis , and astrology charts all were noted . With every square inch of wall decor accounted for , the researchers waited to see which students dropped out ? the highpercentage decorators or the low . It was expected that those who decorated more would drop out less . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as much wall space in their rooms as the " leavers , " who , when they did decorate , used more photos of family , perhaps reflecting loneliness . It proved that decorations can be symbolic of a state of mind in the same way that territorial marking is symbolic of " ownership and intended use . " Personalizing is also a sign of intentions . It can mean , " I like it here , I think I 'll stay . " If you do n't think you 'll stay , why waste the energy or the  | money making yourself at home ? This can be as true in an office or a house as in a dormitory . A few years ago , Alan Hirschfield , who had just been promoted to chairman of 20th Century-Fox after an eighteen-month power struggle , explained why the only things in the office that reflected his taste were one photograph and a tin of candy : " Since my future at the company seemed so precarious , " he said , " I did n't want to waste the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a defiant gesture ? a sign that you do n't want to be where you are . One woman who moved from a large house to a small one as her family contracted , hated the idea of the move and expressed her depression by refusing to fix up the new house . Just as a pain in the arm can signal heart problems , an inability to make simple decorating decisions can often signal relationship problems . Should they or should n't they renovate the kitchen ? wondered one couple . It seemed as if their interest in the kitchen fluctuated with the ups and downs of their relationship . When they fought , they tabled the kitchen design ; when they made up , they started planning again . The existing kitchen was a symbol of their poorly operating marriage , just as the plans for kitchen improvement stood for their hope that things would improve . Neither the marriage nor the kitchen did . Another couple were at an impasse over the sofa . The wife whose " job " it was to make decorating decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa . Should she slipcover it or reupholster it ? What color should she choose ? Her indecision dragged on for months . Her husband was pressing her to take action . He was ashamed of the way the house looked ? he felt he could n't invite people over until the sofa was redone . At the heart of the wife 's indecisiveness was the issue of whether she and her husband were going to stay together . They had given themselves six months to decide . What was the point of recovering the sofa , the wife reasoned , if the marriage was over ? The husband saw it differently . If he could n't invite people over , there would just be more disagreements ? which would doom the trial period . Finally , a therapist mediated the dispute and worked out a compromise . Anything either partner could not decide about , he or she would cease to have jurisdiction over . The results were quite amazing . The husband , who had previously seemed indifferent in matters of taste , took over the sofa project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at last report , the partners were still together . Sometimes the commitment is there , but there are genuine disagreements about taste that can keep people from reaching the finish line . If home is a symbol of self , whose self is the home a symbol of when there is more than one self living in it ? roommates , commune mates , spouses , lovers , siblings , parents , and children ? College roommates often divide their rooms down the middle ? two identities in one space , as separate and distinct as two species of fish in the same tank . On the left , the roommate with the Joni Mitchell poster , yellow flowered spread , pillow shams , and wicker wastebasket . On the right , the roommate with the Sex Pistols poster , an unmade bed , a collection of shot glasses , and a broken mirror on the table . And , oh , the disdain , if one roommate does n't like the other 's symbols of self . Crocheted driver heads on the golf clubs convinced one young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers . " Carmen , a student at the University of Hawaii , is perturbed that her roommate calls all the things she has on display " junk " : the cookie tins in which she stores her embroidery , the Bacardi bottles that remind her of parties past , the Confucius book her grandfather gave her , the worn quilt her grandmother made , the rock she found on Kona and painted to look like a wave , and the tennis ball canister she slammed a volley into and dented the first time she played tennis . Carmen scorns her roommate 's things , too . Her pet peeve is that her roommate uses her collection of disco glasses to drink from . In Carmen 's family , symbolic objects are kept on display ? revered . Traditional poi pounders are not turned into ashtrays . But even when your roommate is Ms. or Mr. Congeniality , there can be taste disagreements . Pairs of people who share apartments or houses , but not lives , feel no pressure to adopt each other 's values . They choose each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage " of economic convenience and defensive life-style matching . Each one is happy to find someone personable and  | solvent who has no bad habits . Do they have to see eye to eye on the decor as well ? Not till one housemate 's Andrew Wyeth posters face the other 's Russian Expressionists do they begin to understand the importance of esthetic compatibility . The roommates would like to give the living room a sense of grown-up coordination . But who has the final say ? Each one wants the place done in his or her image . In New York , the young composer thinks a home should be warm and colorful and would settle for framed posters ; his apartment mate , the young lyricist , wants substantial Art ? the real thing ? and he likes his rooms white and stark ; the composer calls that " sterile . " With close harmony out of the question , they have settled for counterpoint . If two people ca n't agree on what to hang over the bean bags , eight or ten people certainly ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't waste their energy trying to get a consensus on choosing a clan tartan for the living room . The group turf in a shared house tends to be as impersonal as a room in a Best Western motel . It is in the individual bedrooms that personal taste asserts itself . Indeed , marriage is the only residential situation where cohabitors are expected to make a taste merger and present a united front . Nothing can slow a decorating job down more than the need for consensus . Whose taste should prevail ? Whose identity be expressed ? His , hers , theirs , hers with his veto , his with her veto , hers in the living room , his in the den ? Decorating brings up issues and disagreements that couples never had to deal with before . One person wants the house homey , the other wants it " drop dead . " One values things for sentiment . The other despises anything but " good design . " One is a saver , the other a disposer . And because of these conflicts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How does the decorator reconcile the husband 's elephant tusk collection , trophies , and stuffed animal heads with the wife 's desire for light , plants , and music ? The decorator suggested doing the living room in deep terra cotta . The wife said sarcastically , " My husband will love that , it 's the color of dried blood . " Back to the drawing board . Decorating , for some couples , is a negotiated settlement , as any theatrical designer knows . When Paul Sylbert was designing the sets for Kramer vs . Kramer , a film about a couple in a child custody battle , he wanted to establish how the characters lived and
