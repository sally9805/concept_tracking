A strange malady in the sky <P> As a Hollywood horror flick , its title might be The Rash . Scenario : on Eastern Air Lines ' regular flights between New York City and Florida , stewardesses and a few stewards begin to contract a strange , oozing rash on their faces , chests and hands . The fluid escaping from their inflamed pores looks like blood , though it is not , and so the rash is called " red sweat . " Others are stricken by reddish blotches of pinprick-size dots . But either way , before a doctor can diagnose it , the mysterious rash disappears-until , perhaps , the next New York-Florida flight . <P> For Eastern 's baffled management , the story is all too real . Since January , more than 90 flight attendants have reported cases of red sweat , many of them more than once . Nearly all are women , and most have been stricken on Eastern 's new European-produced A300 Airbus jets flying between New York and Miami or Fort Lauderdale . No passengers or pilots have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving its victims wondering if the affliction is only skin deep . " We just ca n't track this thing down , " admits Dr. David Millett , Eastern 's flight medicine director . " It 's spooky , really spooky . " <P> A rash of theories has resulted . One is that the air in the new jet cabins is too dry and induces skin breakouts . Also suspect is a fluid used to clean the planes ' food ovens . Another possibility is a combination of factors , such as altitude changes , genetic susceptibility and even cosmetics . In an effort to solve the mystery , doctors from New York 's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center seemed ready to try a bit of shuttle dermatology : flying on Eastern 's New York-Florida jets to make on-the-spots diagnoses .
