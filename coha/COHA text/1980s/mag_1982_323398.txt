Lessons in waging a psychological war <P> One evening , just as the nightly television news came on , a Pole fed up with the daily dose of government propaganda got out of his chair , turned his TV set toward the window and went out for a stroll . No one in Swidnik , a factory town 100 miles southeast of Warsaw , claims to know just who made that first " news-walk , " but within days almost the entire population of 30,000 began to crowd the tree-lined main street for an evening promenade during the 7:30 newscast . When local authorities clamped on a 7 o'clock curfew to counter the protest , the resourceful residents of Swidnik took a walk during the 5 o'clock news broadcast .

Students who must take military courses at Warsaw University disturb lectures by applauding every mention of the Soviet Union . Theatergoers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actors and musicians who have publicly expressed support for martial law . Many show-business professionals boycott official television broadcasts . Painters now consider public exhibitions to be in bad taste : when the Ministry of Culture mounted a retrospective show of modern Polish art last April , some angry artists demanded that their canvases not be hung .
