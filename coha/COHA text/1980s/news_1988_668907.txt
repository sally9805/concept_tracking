In " The Devil ' s Dictionary , " an enduring delight from the early years of this not always delightful century , Ambrose Bierce set forth among his definitions of " riches " an appropriately immodest one from John D. Rockefeller : " A gift from Heaven signifying , ' This is my beloved son , in whom I am well pleased . ' " His namesake and great-grandson , Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia , might in the interest of family consistency echo the old fellow ' s faith in divine providence for the truly worthy , but most of John D. IV ' s 534 Senate and House colleagues likely would acknowledge that they look closer to home , at least for their political riches . And riches there are in growing abundance , which do seem to flow providently to those demonstrating worthiness by the fact of their incumbency . Someone , or something , somewhere , it would appear , is " well pleased " by incumbents . Though there are still individual angels who provide rewards for such deservedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Political Action Committees . Most of the vast array of interest groups represented by the proliferating PACs seem more interested in the influence they may have on incumbents than in political philosophy . Jean Cobb , associate editor of Common Cause magazine , wrote in a recent Tribune Perspective article that PACs gave House members $65 million in 1986 , 44 percent of their campaign funds . That was up from $40 million , or 37 percent , in 1982 . In 1986 , she noted by way of pointing out the obvious preference for incumbents , Democratic House members got an average of $174 , 731 from PACs while their Republican challengers averaged only $12 , 660 . But it is hard to say which came first : whether the available PAC money led to the scramble for huge warchests on the part of many incumbents or whether the orgy of fundraising extracted ever more golden eggs from willing but not disinterested geese . At the end of 1987 , House members had about $68 million in pocket , more than twice the amount held by incumbents four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 1986 election . Senators up for re-election this year have $36 million ; their challengers have less than $5 million . That gives you some sense of the advantage incumbents have over all but the very wealthiest challengers . But even that doesn ' t measure the breadth of the problem . Too many incumbents have learned a new game from some of the old warhorses of both parties . It ' s called running unopposed . There was a time when powerful machines or the weight of seniority could scare off any challengers of consequence . Now money can chill even the most worthy foe . With expensive television advertising considered the precinct captain of modern politics , few aspirants to a congressional seat can afford to take on an incumbent sitting on several hundred thousand dollars . Rep. David Dreier , a California Republican who won with 73 percent of the vote last time , led all his colleagues at the end of 1987 with $1. 1 million in the bank . He was just ahead of our own Rep. Dan Rostenkowski , who had $904 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll draw this year ? As for the Senate , the cost of most races there is well into seven figures . Occasionally , a politician may lose favor with the electorate by sitting on an obscenely large bundle of money . Jane Byrne ' s widely proclaimed millions almost surely contributed to her 1983 loss to Harold Washington . And sometimes if an incumbent becomes the target of a strong interest group as Sen. Charles Percy was for pro-Israeli forces in losing his seat to Paul Simon , the challenger may receive an outpouring of financial support . But those are exceptions . What usually rules is money and more money , chasing the perceived power of incumbency . Attempts at limiting spending have been fruitless , because ways of avoiding the ceilings seem limitless . And if ever there is agreement among incumbents of both persuasions it is on the foolhardiness of making things easier for challengers . " Never give a sucker an even break " has always been a way of life on the Hill . But somehow , in these big-money days , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess to honor and obey.
