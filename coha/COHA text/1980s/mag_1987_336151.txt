His first book , Oh , God ! , provided the base for three George Burns movies . His third sold few hardback copies , but everyone knew its name after Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep appeared in the film adaptation of Kramer vs . Kramer . This latest work , too , is scheduled to go before the cameras . Once again , viewers are likely to outnumber readers . A pity ; Avery Corman , 51 , has a literary gift for dialogue and predicament . Sealed in a time capsule , 50 could tell future generations more about contemporary middle-age mores than a library of sociological theses . <P> In his late 40s , Sports Columnist Doug Gardner is divorced . His ex-wife glamorously remarries and surrounds their teenagers with luxuries . Doug is suddenly uncertain of anything , even jogging : Do you get the benefits of extra endurance now , he wonders , " when you 're still able to eat a pastrami sandwich , or at the end when you 're already on a life-support system ? " The gloomy sportswriter imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that die . Corman offers savage , sparkling portraits of the hustlers and operators of professional sport , including a newspaper owner who believes in the lowest common dominator : the semiliterate reader who wants upbeat features . <P> Socially , Doug is a dependable loser . His technicolor fantasies fail to arouse young women , who think of him as a black-and-white rerun ; the older ones are even more bathetic than he is . Worse , the mirror reminds Doug that the half-century mark looms : " 50 ! 50 was General MacArthur . . . the school principal . . . 50 was Abby Meltzner , the delicatessen waiter his parents knew , who retired with the shakes . ' Put down the glass , Abby , ' his boss had said . ' You have to go home . ' ' I 'll go home , ' Abby replied . ' But I ca n't put down the glass . ' " <P> Unemployed , estranged from love and family , Doug wonders if redemption is possible in the throes of mid-life . It is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author seems to suffer a failure of nerve , as if the pain of his protagonist were too much for the reader ( or perhaps the screen ) to bear . Until its sun-washed finale , 50 maintains Corman 's gift for putting acute observations in a comic package . But this time out , buyers should discard the pretty pink wrap-up.
