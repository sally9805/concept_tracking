PINK FLOYD THE WALL <P> Maggots ! Corpses ! Brutal cops ! Fascist regalia ! Devouring moms ! Faithless wives ! And on every possible occasion blood spurting and puddling . At the center of the chaos an innocent everyboy ( Bob Geldof , lead singer with those punkers ' punkers , the Boomtown Rats ) broods about how iniquitous life is driving him crazy . It is a story so familiar that it requires almost no dialogue to tell . Simple-minded songs from the Pink Floyd 's 1979 five-time platinum seller do the job , along with banal , if sometimes lively , imagery supplied by Director Alan Parker ( Fame , Midnight Express ) . He has warmed over and slicked up an anthology of ' 60s cliches , which may engender a certain nostalgia for the drear old days in those who endured them . Today 's adolescents sit gap-mouthed and squirmless through them , mistaking them , it would seem , for profundities . Not to worry , though ; the movie is more irrelevant than incendiary and often just a hoot . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagoon that an air of innocent wonder can disarm all parental harrumphing about a movie that is essentially wall-to-wall sex and nudity . Now he has moved his operation from the Pacific to the Greek islands . Instead of titillating his young audience with a little sanitized incest , he offers them a genial disquisition on the joys of the menage a trois . Visually , however , the formula is as before-plenty of skin displayed before Arcadian scenery . The boy ( Peter Gallagher ) has a male-model pout for all emotions , and his American girlfriend ( Daryl Hannah ) obviously flunked elocution in high school , but their mutual friend from France ( Valerie Quennessen ) carries a nicely knowing quality about her . The writing and direction are appropriate to the setting : simple and primitive . <P> <P> FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 IN 3-D <P> Maybe all sequels should be made in 3-D . Imagine how tiresome it would be to see Jason , the monster in the hockey mask , polish off another group of dumb teenagers in an ordinary print . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths he endlessly stalks , the sundry sharp and blunt instruments that are always ready to his hand come at them and the audience with a certain vivid super-reality . It is all so gruesome that horror turns to humor and the fun comes from the appreciation of being cleverly conned by Director Steve Miner . The way the eyeball of one of Jason 's victims pops out of his skull and seems to sail out over the audience 's head is alone worth buying a ticket and putting on the funny glasses .
