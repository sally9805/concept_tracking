run back and forth , so shy , as if she had never considered this before . And suddenly !  --  her eyes look straight down and she knows now she loves him , so much she wants to cry . " Yes , " she says at last , and they marry forever . This was not my case . Instead , the village matchmaker came to ntv family when I was just two years old . No , nobody told Inc this , I remember it all . It was summertime , very hot and dust ) outside , and I could hear cicadas crying in the yard . We were under some trees in our orchard . The servants and my brothers were picking pears high above me . And I was sitting in my mother 's hot sticky arms . I was waving my hand this way and that , because in front of me floated a small bird with horns and colorful paper-thin wings . And then the paper bird flew away and in front of me were two ladies . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sounds . When I was older , I came to recognize this as a Peking accent , which sounds quite strange to Taiyuan people 's ears . The two ladies were looking at my face without talking . The lady with the watery voice had a painted face that was melting . The other lady had the dry face of an old tree trunk . She looked first at me , then at the painted lady . Of course , now I know the tree-trunk lady was the old village matchmaker , and the other was Huang Taitai , the mother of the boy I would be forced to marry . No , it 's not true what some Chinese say about girl babies being worthless . It depends on what kind of girl baby you are . In my case , people could see my value . I looked and smelled like a precious buncake , sweet with a good clean color . The matchmaker bragged about me : " An earth horse for an earth sheep . This is the best marriage combination . " She patted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered in her shrrhh-shrrhh voice that perhaps I had an unusually bad pimhi , a had temper . But the matchmaker laughed and said , " Not so , not so . She is a strong horse . She will grow up to be a hard worker who serves you well in your old age . " And this is when Huang Taitai looked down at me with a cloudy face as though she could penetrate my thoughts and seep51my future intentions . I will never forget her look . Her eyes opened wide , she searched my face carefully and then she smiled . I could see a large gold tooth staring at me like the blinding sun and then the rest of her teeth opened wide as if she were going to swallow me down in one piece . This is how I became betrothed to Huang Taitai 's son , who I later discovered was just a baby , one year younger than I. His name was Tyan-yu  --  tyan for " sky , " because he was so important , and yu , meaning " leftovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and his family thought he might die . Tyan-yu would be the leftover of his father 's spirit . But his father lived and his grandmother was scared the ghosts would turn their attention to this baby boy and take him instead . So they watched him carefully , made all his decisions , and he became very spoiled . But even if I had known I was getting such a bad husband , I had no choice , now or later . That was how backward families in the country were . We were always the last to give up stupid oldfashionedcustoms . In other cities already , a man could choose his own wife , with . his parents ' permission of course . But we were cut off from this type of new thought . You never heard if ideas were better in another city , only if they were worse . We were told stories of sons who were so influenced by bad wives that they threw their old , crying parents out into the street . So , Taiyuanese mothers continued to choose their daughters-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old people , and faithfully sweep the family burial grounds long after the old ladies had gone to their graves . Because I was promised to the Huangs ' son for marriage , my own family began treating me as if I belonged to somebody else . My mother would say to me when the rice bowl went up to my face too many times , " Look how much Huang Taitai 's daughter can eat . " My mother did not treat me this way because she did n't love me . She would say this biting back her tongue , so she would n't wish for something that was no longer hers . I was actually a very obedient child , but sometimes I had a sour look on my face  --  only because I was hot or tired or veryp52ill . This is when my mother would say , " Such an ugly face . The I luangs wo n't want you and our whole family will be disgraced . " And I would cry more to make my face uglier . " It 's no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a contract . It can not be broken . " And I would cry even harder . I did n't see my future husband until I was eight or nine . The world that I knew was our family compound in the village outside of Taiyuan . My family lived in a modest two-story house with a smaller house in the same compound , which was really just two side-by-side rooms for our cook , an everyday servant , and their families . Our house sat on a little hill . We called this hill Three Steps to Heaven , but it was really just centuries of hardenedlayers of mud washed up by the Fen River . On the east wall of our compound was the river , which my father said liked to swallow little children . He said it had once swallowed the whole town of Taiyuan . The river ran brown in the summer . In the winter , the river was blue-green in the narrow fast-moving spots . In the wider places , it was frozen still , white with cold . Oh , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and caught many fish  --  giant slippery creatures plucked while they were still sleeping in their frozen riverbeds  --  so fresh that even after they were gutted they would dance on their tails when thrown into the hot pan . That was also the year I first saw my husband as a little boy . When the firecrackers went off , he cried loud  --  wah !  --  with a big open mouth even though he was not a baby . Later I would see him at red-egg ceremonies when one-montholdboy babies were given their real names . He would sit on his grandmother 's old knees , almost cracking them with his weight . And he would refuse to eat everything offered to him , always turning his nose away as though someone were offering him a stinky pickle and not a sweet cake . So I did n't have instant love for my future husband the way you see on television today . I thought of this boy more like a troublesome cousin . I learned to be polite to the Huangs and especially to Huang Taitai . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What do you say to your mother ? " Andp53I would be confused , not knowing which mother she meant . So I would turn to my real mother and say , " Excuse me , Ma , " and then I would turn to Huang Taitai and present her with a little goodie to eat , saying , " For you , Mother . " I remember it was once a lump of syaumei , a little dumpling I loved to eat . My mother told Huang Taitai I had made this dumpling especially for her , even though I had only poked its steamy sides with my finger when the cook poured it onto the serving plate . My life changed completely when I was twelve , the summer the heavy rains came . The Fen River which ran through the middle of my family 's land flooded the plains . It destroyed all the wheat my family had planted that year and made the land useless for years to come . Even our house on top of the little hill became unlivable . When we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furniture were covered with sticky mud . The courtyards were littered with uprooted trees , broken bits of walls , and dead chickens . We were so poor in all this mess . You could n't go to an insurance company back then and say , Somebody did this damage , pay me a million dollars . In those days , you were unlucky if you had exhausted your own possibilities . My father said we had no choice but to move the family to Wushi , to the south near Shanghai , where my mother 's brother owned a small flour mill . My father explained that the whole family , except for me , would leave immediately . I was twelve years old , old enough to separate from my family and live with the Huangs . The roads were so muddy and filled with giant potholes that no truck was willing to come to the house . All the heavy furniture and bedding had to be left behind , and these were promised to the Huangs as my dowry . In this way , my family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , said my father . But he could not stop my mother from giving me her ( hang , a necklace made out of a tablet of red jade . When she put it around my neck , she acted very stern , so I knew she wasp54very sad . " Obey your family . Do not disgrace us , " she said . " Act happy when you arrive . Really , you 're very lucky . " The I luangs ' house also sat next to the river . While our house had been flooded , their house was . untouched . This is because their house sat higher up in the valley . And this was the first time I realized the Huangs had a much better position than my family . They looked down on us , which made me understand why Huang Taitai and Tyan-yu had such long noses . When I passed under the Huangs ' stone-and-wood gateway arch , I saw a large courtyard with three or four rows of small , low buildings . Some were for storing supplies , others for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main house . I walked closer and stared at the house that would be my home for the rest of my life . The house had been in the family for many generations . It was not really so old or remarkable , but I could see it had grown up along with the family . There were four stories , one for each generation : great-grandparents , grandparents , parents , and children . The house had a confused look . It had been hastily built and then rooms and floors and wings and decorations had been added on in every which manner , reflecting too many opinions . The first level was built of river rocks held together by straw-filled mud . The second and third levels were made of smooth bricks with an exposed walkway to give it the look of a palace tower . And the top level had gray slab walls topped with a red tile roof . To make the house seem important , there were two large round pillars holding up a verandaentrance to the front door . These pillars were painted red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably Huang Taitai , had added imperial dragon heads at the corners of the roof . Inside , the house held a different kind of pretense . The only nice room was a parlor on the first floor , which the Huangs used to receive guests . This room contained tables and chairs carved out of red lacquer , fine pillows embroidered with the Huangp55family name in the ancient style , and many ' precious things that gave the look of wealth and old prestige . The rest of the house was plain and uncomfortable and noisy with the complaints of twenty relatives . I think with each generation the house had grown smaller inside , more crowded . Each room had been cut in half to make two . No big celebration was held when I arrived . Huang Taitai did n't have red banners greeting me in the fancy room on the first floor . Tyan-yu was not there to greet me . Instead , Huang Taitai hurried me upstairs to the second floor and into the kitchen , which was a place where family children did n't usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I knew my standing . That first day , I stood in my best padded dress at the low wooden table and began to chop vegetables . I could not keep my hands steady . I missed my family and my stomach felt bad , knowing I had finally arrived where my life said I belonged . But I was also determined to honor my parents ' words , so Huang Taitai could never accuse my mother of losing face . She would not win that from our family . As I was thinking this I saw an old servant woman stooping over the same low table gutting a fish , looking at me from the corner of her eye . I was crying and I was afraid she would tell I Luang Taitai . So I gave a big smile and shouted , " What a lucky girl I am . I 'm going to have the best life . " And in this quickthinkingway I must have waved my knife too close to her nose because she cried angrily , " Shemma bende ren ! "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away this was a warning , because when I shouted that declaration of happiness , I almost tricked myself into thinking it might come true . I saw Tyan-yu at the evening meal . I was still a few inches hiller than he , but he acted like a big warlord . I knew what kind of husband he would be , because he made special efforts to make me cry . He complained the soup was not hot enough and Then spilled the bowl as if it were an accident . He waited untilh:td sat down to eat and then would demand another bowl of rkc . I le asked why I had such an unpleasant face when looking r ,  --  1 him . Over the next few years , Huang Taitai instructed the otherp56servants to teach me how to sew sharp corners on pillowcases and to embroider my future family 's name . How can a wife keep her husband 's household in order if she has never dirtied her own hands , Huang Taitai used to say as she introduced me to a new task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was very good at calling out orders and criticism . " Teach her to wash rice properly so that the water runs clear . Her husband can not eat muddy rice , " she 'd say to a cook servant . Another time , she told a servant to show me how to clean a chamber pot : " Make her put her own nose to the barrel to make sure it 's clean . " That was how I learned to be an obedient wife . I learned to cook so well that I could smell if the meat stuffing was too salty before I even tasted it . I could sew such small stitches it looked as if the embroidery had been painted on . And even Huang Taitai complained in a pretend manner that she could scarcely throw a dirty blouse on the floor before it was cleaned and on her back once again , causing her to wear the same clothes every day . After a while I did n't think it was a terrible life , no , not really . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any difference . What was happier than seeing everybody gobble down the shiny mushroomsand bamboo shoots I had helped to prepare that day ? What was more satisfying than having Huang Taitai nod and pat my head when I had finished combing her hair one hundred strokes ? How much happier could I be after seeing Tyan-yu eat a whole bowl of noodles without once complaining about its taste or my looks ? It 's like those ladies you see on American TV these days , the ones who are so happy they have washed out a stain so the clothes look better than new . Can you see how the Huangs almost washed their thinking into my skin ? I came to think of Tyan-yu as a god , someone whose opinions were worth much more than my own life . I came to think of Huang Taitai as my real mother , someone I wanted to please , someone I should follow and obey without question . When I turned sixteen on the lunar new year , Huang Taitai told me she was ready to welcome a grandson by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry , where would I go live instead ?  |p57Even  though I was strong as a horse , how could I run away ? The Japanese were in every corner of China . " The Japanese showed up as uninvited guests , " said Tyan-yu 's grandmother , " and that 's why nobody else came . " Huang Taitai had made elaborate plans , but our wedding was very small . She had asked the entire village and friends and family from other cities as well . In those days , you did n't do RSVP . It was not polite not to come . Huang Taitai did n't think the war would change people 's good manners . So the cook and her helpers prepared hundreds of dishes . My family 's old furniture had been shined up into an impressive dowry and placed in the front parlor . Huang Taitai had taken care to remove all the water and mud marks . She had even commissioned someone to write felicitous messages on red banners , as if my parents themselves had draped these decorations to congratulate me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red palanquin to carry me from her neighbor'shouse to the wedding ceremony . A lot of bad luck fell on our wedding day , even though the matchmaker had chosen a lucky day , the fifteenth day of the eighth moon , when the moon is perfectly round and bigger than any other time of the year . But the week before the moon arrived , the Japanese came . They invaded Shansi province , as well as the provinces bordering us . People were nervous . And the morningof the fifteenth , on the day of the wedding celebration , it began to rain , a very bad sign . When the thunder and lightning began , people confused it with Japanese bombs and would not leave their houses . I heard later that poor Huang Taitai waited many hours for more people to come , and finally , when she could not wring any more guests out of her hands , she decided to start the ceremony . What could she do ? She could not change the war . I was at the neighbor 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red palanquin , I was sitting at a small dressing table by an open window . I began to cry and thought bitterlyp58about my parents ' promise . I wondered why my destiny had been decided , why I should have an unhappy life so someone else could have a happy one . From my seat by the window I could see the Fen River with its muddy brown waters . I thought about throwing my body into this river that had destroyed my family 's happiness . A person has very strange thoughts when it seems that life is about to end . It started to rain again , just a light rain . The people from downstairs called up to me once again to hurry . And my thoughts became more urgent , more strange . I asked myself , What is true about a person ? Would I change in the same way the river changes color but still be the same person ? And then I saw the curtains blowing wildly , and outside rain was falling harder , causing everyone to scurry and shout . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I could see the power of the wind . I could n't sec the wind itself , but I could see it carried the water that filled the rivers and shaped the countryside . It caused men to yell ) and dance . I wiped my eyes and looked in the mirror . I was surprised at what I saw . I had on a beautiful red dress , but what I saw was even more valuable . I was strong . I was pure . I had genuine thoughts inside that no one could see , that no one could ever take away from me . I was like the wind . I threw my head back and smiled proudly to myself . And then I draped the large embroidered red scarf over my face and coveredthese thoughts up . But underneath the scarf I still knew who I was . I made a promise to myself : I would always remember my parents ' wishes , but I would never forget myself . When I arrived at the wedding , I had the red scarf over my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when I bent my head forward , I could see out the sides . Very few people had come . I saw the Huangs , the same old complaining relatives now embarrassed by this poor showing , the entertainers with their violins and flutes . And there were a few village people who had been brave enough to come out for a free meal . I even saw servants and their children , who must have been added to make the party look bigger . Someone took my hands and guided me down a path . I wasp59like a blind person walking to my fate . But I was no longer scared . I could see what was inside me . A high official conducted the ceremony and he talked too long about philosophers and models of virtue . Then I heard the matchmaker speak about our birthdates and harmony and fertility . I tipped my veiled head forward and I could see her hands unfolding a red silk scarf and holding up a red candle for everyone to see . The candle had two ends for lighting . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other with mine . The matchmaker lighted both ends and announced , " The marriage has begun . " Tyan yanked the scarf off my face and smiled at his friends and family , never even looking at me . He reminded me of a young peacock I once saw that acted as if he had just claimed the entire courtyard by fanning his still-short tail . I saw the matchmaker place the lighted red candle in a gold holder and then hand it to a nervous-looking servant . This servantwas supposed to watch the candle during the banquet and all night to make sure neither end went out . In the morning the matchmaker was supposed to show the result , a little piece of black ash , and then declare , " This candle burned continuously at both ends without going out . This is a marriage that can never be broken . " I still can remember . That candle was a marriage bond that was worth more than a Catholic promise not to divorce . It meant I could n't divorce and I could n't ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to seal me forever with my husband and his family , no excuses afterward . And sure enough , the matchmaker made her declaration the next morning and showed she had done her job . But I know what really happened , because I stayed up all night crying about my marriage . After the banquet , our small wedding party pushed us and half carried us up to the third floor to our small bedroom . People were shouting jokes and pulling boys from underneath the bed.  |p60The  matchmaker helped small children pull red eggs that had been hidden between the blankets . The boys who were about Tyan-yu 's age made us sit on the bed side by side and everybody made us kiss so our faces would turn red with passion . Firecrackersexploded on the walkway outside our open window and someone said this was a good excuse for me to jump into my husband 's arms . After everyone left , we sat there side by side without words for many minutes , still listening to the laughing outside . When it grew quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep on the sofa . " Ile threw a pillow and a thin blanket to me . I was so glad ! I waited until he fell asleep and then I got up quietly and went outside , down the stairs and into the dark courtyard . Outside it smelled as if it would soon rain again . I was crying , walking in my bare feet and feeling the wet heat still inside the bricks . Across the courtyard I could see the matchmaker 's servant through a yellow-lit open window . She was sitting at a table , looking very sleepy as the red candle burned in its special gold holder . I sat down by a tree to watch my fate being decided for me . I must have fallen asleep because I remember being startled awake by the sound of loud cracking thunder . That 's when I saw the matchmaker 's servant running from the room , scared as a chicken about to lose its head . Oh , she was asleep too , I thought , and now she thinks it 's the Japanese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thunder came , and she ran out of the courtyard and down the road , going so fast and hard I could see pebbles kicking up behind her . Where does she think she 's running to , I wondered , still laughing . And then I saw the red candle flickering just a little with the breeze . I was not thinking when my legs lifted me up and my feet ran me across the courtyard to the yellow-lit room . But I was hoping  --  I was praying to Buddha , the goddess of mercy , and the full moon  --  to make that candle go out . It fluttered a little and the flame bent down low , but still both ends burned strong . My throat filled with so much hope that it finally burst and blew out my husband 's end of the candle . I immediately shivered with fear . I thought a knife wouldp61appear and cut me down dead . Or the sky would open up and blow me away . But nothing happened , and when my senses came back , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning the matchmaker made her proud declarationin front of Tyan-yu , his parents , and myself . " My job is done , " she announced , pouring the remaining black ash onto the red cloth . I saw her servant 's shame-faced , mournful look . I learned to love Tyan-yu , but it is not how you think . From the beginning , I would always become sick thinking he would someday climb on top of me and do his business . Every time I went into our bedroom , my hair would already be standing up . But during the first months , he never touched me . He slept in his bed , I slept on my sofa . In front of his parents , I was an obedient wife , just as they taught me . I instructed the cook to kill a fresh young chicken every morning and cook it until pure juice came out . I would strain this juice myself into a bowl , never adding any water . I gave this to him for breakfast , murmuring good wishes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special tonic soup called tounau , which was not only very delicious but has eight ingredientsthat guarantee long life for mothers . This pleased my mother-in-law very much . But it was not enough to keep her happy . One morning , Huang Taitai and I were sitting in the same room , working on our embroidery . I was dreaming about my childhood , about a pet frog I once kept named Big Wind . Huang Taitai seemed restless , as if she had an itch in the bottom of her shoe . I heard her huffing and then all of a sudden she stood up from her chair , walked over to me , and slapped my face . " Bad wife ! " she cried . " If you refuse to sleep with my son , I refuse to feed you or clothe you . " So that 's how I knew what my husband had said to avoid his mother 's anger . I was also boiling with anger , but I said nothing , remembering my promise to my parents to be an obedient wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to touchp62me. gut he did n't . I was relieved . The next night , I lay straight down on the bed next to him . And still he did n't touch me . So the next night , I took off my gown . That 's when I could see what was underneath Tyan-yu . He was scared and turned his face . He had no desire for me , but it was his fear that made me think he had no desire for any woman . f le was like a little boy who had never grown up . After a while I was no longer afraid . I even began to think differently toward ' l an-vtl . It was not like the way a wife loves a husband , but more like the way a sister protects a younger brother . I put my gown back on and lay down next to him and rubbed his back . I knew I no longer had to be afraid . I was sleeping with Tyanu . I le would never touch me and I had a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my stomach and breasts remained small and flat , Huang Taitai flew into another kind of rage . " My son says he 's planted enough seeds for thousands of grandchildren . Where are they ? It must be you are doing something wrong . " And after that she confined me to the bed so that her grandchildren 's seeds would not spill out so easily . Oh , you think it is so much fun to lie in bed all day , never getting up . But I tell you it was worse than a prison . I think I luting Taitai became a little crazy . She told the servants to take all sharp things out of the room , thinking scissors and knives were cutting off her next generation . She forbade me from sewing . She said I must concentrate and think of nothing but having babies . And four times a day , a very nice servant girl would come into my room , apologizing the whole time while making me drink a terrible-tasting medicine . I envied this girl , the way she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my window , I would imagine I was that girl , standing in the courtyard , bargaining with the traveling shoe mender , gossiping with other servant girls , scolding a handsomedelivery man in her high teasing voice . One day , after two months had gone by without any results , Huang Taitai called the old matchmaker to the house . The matchmaker examined me closely , looked up my birthdate andp63the hour of my birth , and then asked Huang Taitai about my nature . Finally , the matchmaker gave her conclusions : " It 's clear what has happened . A woman can have sons only if she is deficientin one of the elements . Your daughter-in-law was born with enough wood , fire , water , and earth , and she was deficient in metal , which was a good sign . But when she was married , you loaded her down with gold bracelets and decorations and now she has all the elements , including metal . She 's too balanced to have babies . " This turned out to be joyous news for Huang Taitai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gold and jewelry to help me become fertile . And it was good news for me too . Because after the gold was removed from my body , I felt lighter , more free . They say this is what happens if you lack metal . You begin to think as an independent person . That day I started to think about how I would escape this marriage without breaking my promise to my family . It was really quite simple . I made the Huangs think it was their idea to get rid of me , that they would be the ones to say the marriage contract was not valid . I thought about my plan for many days . I observed everyone around me , the thoughts they showed in their faces , and then I was ready . I chose an auspicious day , the third day of the third month . That 's the day of the Festival of Pure Brightness . On this day , your thoughts must be clear as you prepare to think about your ancestors . That 's the day when everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the weeds and brooms to sweep the stones and they offer dumplings and oranges as spiritual food . Oh , it 's not a somber day , more like a picnic , but it has special meaning to someone looking for grandsons . On the morning of that day , I woke up Tyan-yu and the entire house with my wailing . It took Huang Taitai a long time to come into my room . " What 's wrong with her now , " she cried from her room . " Go make her be quiet . " But finally , after my wailing did n't stop , she rushed into my room , scolding me at the top of her voice . I was clutching my mouth with one hand and my eyes withp64another . My body was writhing as if I were seized by a terrible pain . I was quite convincing , because Huang Taitai drew back and grew small like a scared animal . " What 's wrong , little daughter ? Tell me quickly , " she cried . " Oh , it 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said betweengasps and more wailing . After enough wailing , I said what was so unthinkable . " I had a dream , " I reported . " Our ancestors came tome and said they wanted to see our wedding . So Tyan-yu and I held the same ceremony for our ancestors . We saw the matchmaker light the candle and give it to the servant to watch . Our ancestors were so pleased , so pleased .... " Huang Taitai looked impatient as I began to cry softly again . " But then the servant left the room with our candle and a big wind came and blew the candle out . And our ancestors became very angry . They shouted that the marriage was doomed ! They said that Tyan-yu 's end of the candle had blown out ! Our ancestorssaid Tyan-yu would die if he stayed in this marriage ! " Tyan-yu 's face turned white . But Huang Taitai only frowned . " What a stupid girl to have such bad dreams ! " And then she scolded everybody to go back to bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper . " Please do n't leave me ! I am afraid ! Our ancestors said if the matter is not settled , they would begin the cycle of destruction . " " What is this nonsense ! " cried Huang Taitai , turning back toward me . Tyan-yu followed her , wearing his mother 's same frowning face . And I knew they were almost caught , two ducks leaning into the pot . " They knew you would not believe me , " I said in a remorseful tone , " because they know I do not want to leave the comforts of my marriage . So our ancestors said they would plant the signs , to show our marriage is now rotting . " " What nonsense from your stupid head , " said Huang Taitai , sighing . But she could not resist . " What signs ? " " In my dream , I saw a man with a long beard and a mole on his cheek . " " Tyan-yu 's grandfather ? " asked Huang Taitai . I nodded , remembering the painting I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three signs . First , he has drawn a black spot on Tyan-yu 's back , and this spot will grow and eat away Tyan-yu 's flesh just as it ate away our ancestor 's face before he died . " Huang Taitai quickly turned to Tyan-yu and pulled his shirt up . " Ai-ya ! " she cried , because there it was , the same black mole , the size of a fingertip , just as I had always seen it these past five months of sleeping as sister and brother . " And then our ancestor touched my mouth , " and I patted my cheek as if it already hurt . " He said my teeth would start to fall out one by one , until I could no longer protest leaving this marriage . " Huang Taitai pried open my mouth and gasped upon seeing the open spot in the back of my mouth where a rotted tooth fell out four years ago . " And finally , I saw him plant a seed in a servant girl 's womb . He said this girl only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really from imperial blood , and ... I lay my head down on the pillow as if too tired to . go on . Huang Taitai pushed my shoulder , " What does he say ? " " He said the servant girl is Tyan-yu 's true spiritual wife . And the seed he has planted will grow into Tyan-yu 's child . " By mid-morning they had dragged the matchmaker 's servant over to our house and extracted her terrible confession . And after much searching they found the servant girl I liked so much , the one I had watched from my window every day . I had seen her eyes grow bigger and her teasing voice become smaller whenever the handsome delivery man arrived . And later , I had watched her stomach grow rounder and her face become longer with fear and worry . So you can imagine how happy she was when they forced her to tell the truth about her imperial ancestry . I heard later she was so struck with this miracle of marrying Tyan-yu she became a very religious person who ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , but once a day.  |p66There  's no more to the story . They did n't blame me so much . Huang Taitai got her grandson . I got my clothes , a rail ticket to Peking , and enough money to go to America . The Huangs asked only that I never tell anybody of any importance about the story of my doomed marriage . It 's a true story , how I kept my promise , how I sacrificed my life . See the gold metal I can now wear . I gave birth to your brothers and then your father gave me these two bracelets . Then I had you . And every few years , when I have a little extra money , I buy another bracelet . I know what I 'm worth . They 're always twenty-four carats , all genuine . But I 'll never forget . On the day of the Festival of Pure Brightness , I take off all my bracelets . I remember the day when I finally knew a genuine thought and could follow where it went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face under a red marriage scarf . I promised not to forget myself . How nice it is to be that girl again , to take off my scarf , to see what is underneath and feel the lightness come back into my body !  |p67For  all these years I kept my mouth closed so selfish desires would not fall out . And because I remained quiet for so long now my daughter does not hear me . She sits by her fancy swimmingpool and hears only her Sony Walkman , her cordless phone , her big , important husband asking her why they have charcoal and no lighter fluid . All these years I kept my true nature hidden , running along like a small shadow so nobody could catch me . And because I moved so secretly now my daughter does not see me . She sees a list of things to buy , her checkbook out of balance , her ashtray sitting crooked on a straight table . And I want to tell her this : We are lost , she and I , unseen and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not lose myself all at once . I rubbed out my face over the years washing away my pain , the same way carvings on stone are worn down by water . Yet today I can remember a time when I ran and shouted , when I could not stand still . It is my earliest recollection : telling the Moon Lady my secret wish . And because I forgot what I wished for , that memory remained hidden from me all these many years . But now I remember the wish , and I can recall the details ofp68that entire day , as clearly as I see my daughter and the foolishness of her life . In 1918 , the year that I was four , the Moon Festival arrived during an autumn in Wushi that was unusually hot , terribly hot . When I awoke that morning , the fifteenth day of the eighth moon , the straw mat covering my bed was already sticky . Everythingin the room smelled of wet grass simmering in the heat . Earlier in the summer , the servants had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Every bed was covered with a woven mat , our only bedding during the months of constant wet heat . And the hot bricks of the courtyard were crisscrossed with bamboo paths . Autumn had come , but without its cool mornings and evenings . And so the stale heat still remained in the shadows behind the curtains , heating up the acrid smells of my chamber pot , seeping into my pillow , chafing the back of my neck and puffing up my cheeks , so that I awoke that morning with a restless complaint . There was another smell , outside , something burning , a pungentfragrance that was half sweet and half bitter . " What 's that stinky smell ? " I asked my amah , who always managed to appear next to my bed the instant I was awake . She slept on a cot in a little room next to mine . " It is the same as I explained yesterday , " she said , lifting me out of my bed and setting me on her knee . And my sleepy mind tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning before . " We are burning the Five Evils , " I said drowsily , then squirmed out of her warm lap . I climbed on top of a little stool and looked out the window into the courtyard below . I saw a green coil curled in the shape of a snake , with a tail that billowed yellow smoke . The other day , Amah had shown me that the snake had come out of a colorful box decorated with five evil creatures : a swimming snake , a jumping scorpion , a flying centipede , a dropping-downspider , and a springing lizard . The bite of any one of these creatures could kill a child , explained Amah . So I was relieved to think we had caught the Five Evils and were burning their corpses . I did n't know the green coil was merely incense used to chase away mosquitoes and small flies.  |p69That  day , instead of dressing me in a light cotton jacket and loose trousers , Amah brought out a heavy yellow silk jacket and skirt outlined with black bands . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lined jacket . " Your mother has made you new tiger clothes for the Moon Festival . . . . " She lifted me into the pants . " Very important day , and now you are a big girl , so you can go to the ceremony . " " What is a ceremony ? " I asked as Amah slipped the jacket over my cotton undergarments . " It is a proper way to behave . You do this and that , so the gods do not punish you , " said Amah as she fastened my frog clasps . " What kind of punishment ? " I asked boldly . " Too many questions ! " cried Amah . " You do not need to understand . Just behave , follow your mother 's example . Light the incense , make an offering to the moon , bow your head . Do not shame me , Ying-ying . " I bowed my head with a pout . I noticed the black bands on my sleeves , the tiny embroidered peonies growing from curlicues of gold thread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out , gently nudging flowers and leaves and vines to bloom on the cloth . And then I heard voices in the courtyard . Standing on my stool , I strained to find them . Somebody was complaining about the heat : " . . . feel my arm , steamed soft clear to the bone . " Many relatives from the north had arrived for the Moon Festival and were staying for the week . Amah tried to pull a wide comb through my hair and I pretended to tumble off the stool as soon as she reached a knot . " Stand still , Ying-ying ! " she cried , her usual lament , while I giggled and wobbled on the stool . And then she yanked the full length of my hair like the reins of a horse and before I could fall off the stool again , she quickly twisted my hair into a single braid off to the side , weaving into it five strands of colorful silk . She wound my braid into a tight ball , then arranged and snipped the loose silk strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me around to inspect her handiwork . I was roasting in the lined silk jacket and pants obviously made with a coolerp70day in mind . My scalp was burning with the pain of Amah 's attentions . What kind of day could be worth so much suffering ? ' " Pretty , " pronounced Amah , even though I wore a scowl on my face . " Who is coming today ? " I asked . " Dajya "  --  All the family  --  she said happily . " We are all going to Tai Lake . The family has rented a boat with a famous chef . And tonight at the ceremony you will see the Moon Lady . " " The Moon Lady ! The Moon Lady ! " I said , jumping up and down with great delight . And then , after I ceased to be amazed with the pleasant sounds of my voice saying new words , I tugged Amah 's sleeve and asked : " Who is the Moon Lady ? " " Chang-o . She lives on the moon and today is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilled . " " What is a secret wish ? " " It is what you want but can not ask , " said Amah . " Why ca n't I ask ? " " This is because . . . because if you ask it . . . it is no longer a wish but a selfish desire , " said Amah . " Have n't I taught you  --  that it is wrong to think of your own needs ? A girl can never ask , only listen . " " Then how will the Moon Lady know my wish ? " " Ai ! You ask too much already ! You can ask her because she is not an ordinary person . " Satisfied at last , I immediately said : " Then I will tell her I do n't want to wear these clothes anymore . " " Ah ! Did I not just explain ? " said Amah . " Now that you have mentioned this to me , it is not a secret wish anymore . " During the morning meal nobody seemed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that always eating one more thing . And after breakfast everybody kept talking about things of little consequence . I grew more worried and unhappy by the minute . " ... Autumn moon warms . 0 ! Geese shadows return . " Baba was reciting a long poem he had deciphered from ancient stone inscriptions . " The third word in the next line , " explained Baba , " was wornp71off the slab , its meaning washed away by centuries of rain , almost lost to posterity forever . " " Ah , but fortunately , " said my uncle , his eyes twinkling , " you are a dedicated scholar of ancient history and literature . You were able to solve it , I think . " My father responded with the line : " Mist flowers radiant . 0 ! ... " Mama was telling my aunt and the old ladies how to mix various herbs and insects to produce a balm : " This you rub here , between these two spots . Rub it vigorously until your skin heats and the achiness is burned out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen foot ? " lamented the old lady . " Both inside and outside have a sour painful feeling . Too tender to even touch ! " " It is the heat , " complained another old auntie . " Cooking all your flesh dry and brittle . " " And burning your eyes ! " exclaimed my great-aunt . I sighed over and over again every time they started a new topic . Amah finally noticed me and gave me a mooncake in the shape of a rabbit . She said I could sit in the courtyard and eat it with my two little half-sisters , Number Two and Number Three . It is easy to forget about a boat when you have a rabbit mooncakein your hand . The three of us walked quickly out of the room , and as soon as we passed through the moongate that led to the inner courtyard , we tumbled and shrieked , running to see who could get to the stone bench first . I was the biggest , so I sat in the shady part , where the stone slab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke off a rabbit ear for each of them . The ears were just dough , no sweet filling or egg yolk inside , but my half-sisters were too little to know any better . " Sister likes me better , " said Number Two to Number Three . " Me better , " said Number Three to Number Two . " Do n't make trouble , " I said to them both . I ate the rabbit 's body , rolling my tongue over my lips to lick off the sticky bean paste . We picked crumbs off one another , and after we finished ourp72treat it grew quiet and once again I became restless . Suddenly I saw a dragonfly with a large crimson body and transparent wings . I leapt off the bench and ran to chase it , and my halfsistersfollowed me , jumping and thrusting their hands upward as it flew away . " Ying-ying ! " I heard Amah call , and Number Two and NumberThree ran off . Amah was standing in the courtyard and my mother and the other ladies were now coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smooth my yellow jacket . " Syin yifu ! Yidafadwo ! "  --  Your new clothes ! Everything , all over the place !  --  she cried in a show of distress . My mother smiled and walked over to me . She smoothed some of my wayward hairs back in place and tucked them into my coiled braid . " A boy can run and chase dragonflies , because that is his nature , " she said . " But a girl should stand still . If you are still for a very long time , a dragonfly will no longer see you . Then it will come to you and hide in the comfort of your shadow . " The old ladies clucked in agreement and then they all left me in the middle of the hot courtyard . Standing perfectly still like that , I discovered my shadow . At first it was just a dark spot on the bamboo mats that covered the courtyard bricks . It had short legs and long arms , a dark coiled braid just like mine . When I shook my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . We raised one leg . I turned to walk away and it followed me . I turned back around quickly and it faced me . I lifted the bamboo mat to see if I could peel off my shadow , but it was under the mat , on the brick . I shrieked with delight at my shadow 's own cleverness . I ran to the shade under the tree , watching my shadow chase me . It disappeared . I loved my shadow , this dark side of me that had my same restless nature . And then I heard Amah calling me again . " Ying-ying ! It is time . Are you ready to go to the lake ? " I nodded my head and began to run toward her , my self running ahead . " Slowly , go slowly , " admonished Amah . Our entire family was already standing outside , chatting excitedly . Everybody was dressed in important-looking clothes . Baba was in a new brown-colored gown , which while plain wasp73of an obviously fine-quality silk weave and workmanship . Mama had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse of mine : black silk with yellow bands . My half-sisters wore rosecoloredtunics and so did their mothers , my father 's concubines . My older brother had on a blue jacket embroidered with shapes resembling Buddha scepters for long life . Even the old ladies had put on their best clothes to celebrate : Mama 's aunt , Baba 's mother and her cousin , and Great-uncle 's fat wife , who still plucked her forehead bald and always walked as if she were crossing a slippery stream , two tiny steps and then a scared look . The servants had already packed and loaded a rickshaw with the day 's basic provisions : a woven hamper filled with tong ti  --  the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves , some filled with roasted ham , some with sweet lotus seeds ; a small stove for boiling water for hot tea ; another hamper containing cups and bowls and chopsticks ; a cotton sack of apples , pomegranates , and pears ; sweaty earthen jars of preserved meats and vegetables ; stacks of red boxes lined with four mooncakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon nap . Then everybody climbed into rickshaws , the younger children sitting next to their amahs . At the last moment , before we all set off , I wriggled out of Amah 's grasp and jumped out of the rickshaw . I climbed into the rickshaw with my mother in it , which displeased Amah , because this was presumptuous behavioron my part and also because Amah loved me better than her own . She had given up her own child , a baby son , when her husband had died and she had come to our house to be my nursemaid . But I was very spoiled because of her ; she had never taught me to think about her feelings . So I thought of Amah only as someone for my comfort , the way you might think of a fan in the summer or a heater in the winter , a blessing you appreciate and love only when it is no longer there . When we arrived at the lake , I was disappointed to feel no cooling breezes . Our rickshaw pullers were soaked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the dock , I watched as the old ladies and men started climbing aboard a large boat our family had rented . The boat looked like a floating teahouse , with an open-air pavilion larger than the one in ourp74courtyard . It had many red columns and a peaked tile roof , and behind that what looked like a garden house with round windows . When it was our turn , Amah grasped my hand tightly and we bounced across the plank . But as soon as my feet touched the deck , I sprang free and , together with Number Two and Number Three , I pushed my way past people 's legs enclosed in billows of dark and bright silk clothes  --  trying to see who would be the first to run the length of the boat . I loved the unsteady feeling of almost falling one way then another . Red lanterns hanging from the roof and railings swayed , as if pushed by a breeze . My half-sisters and I ran our fingers over benches and small tables in the pavilion . We traced our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poked our faces through openings to see the water below . And then there were more things to find ! I opened a heavy door leading into the garden house and ran past a room that looked like a large sitting area . My sisters followed behind laughing . Through another door , I saw people in a kitchen . A man holding a big cleaver turned and saw us , then called to us , as we shyly smiled and backed away . At the rear of the boat we saw poor-looking people : a man feeding sticks into a tall chimney stove , a woman chopping vegetables , and two rough-looking boys squatting close to the edge of the boat , holding what looked to be a piece of string attached to a wire-mesh cage lying just below the surface of the water . They gave us not even a glance . We returned to the front of the boat , just in time to see the dock moving away from us . Mama and the other ladies were already seated on benches around the pavilion , fanning themselvesfuriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes lighted . Baba and Uncle were leaning over a rail , talking in deep , serious voices . My brother and some of his boy cousins had found a long bamboo stick and were poking the water as if they could make the boat go faster . The servants were seated in a cluster at the front , heating water for tea , shellingroasted gingko nuts , and emptying out hampers of food for a noonday meal of cold dishes.  |p75Even  though Tai Lake is one of the largest in all of China , that day it seemed crowded with boats : rowboats , pedal boats , sailboats , fishing boats , and floating pavilions like ours . So we often passed other people leaning out to trail their hands in the cool water , some drifting by asleep beneath a cloth canopy or oil-coated umbrella . Suddenly I heard people crying , " Ahh ! Ahh ! Ahh ! " and I thought , At last , the day has begun ! I raced to the pavilion and found aunts and uncles laughing as they used chopsticks to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tiny legs bristling . So this was what the mesh cage beneath the water had contained , freshwater shrimp , which my father was now dipping into a spicy bean-curd sauce and popping into his mouth with two bites and a swallow . But the excitement soon waned , and the afternoon seemed to pass like any other at home . The same listlessness after the meal . A little drowsy gossip with hot tea . Amah telling me to lie down on my mat . The quiet as everyone slept through the hottest part of the day . I sat up and saw Amah was still asleep , lying askew on her sleeping mat . I wandered to the back of the boat . The roughlookingboys were removing a large , squawking long-necked bird from a bamboo cage . The bird had a metal ring around its neck . One boy held onto the bird , wrapping his arms around the bird 's wings . The other tied a thick rope to a loop on the metal neck ring . Then they released the bird and it swooped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat , then sat on top of the shiny water . I walked over to the edge and looked at the bird . He looked back at me warily with one eye . Then the bird dove under the water and disappeared . One of the boys threw a raft made of hollow reed flutes into the water and then dove in and emerged on top of the raft . In a few seconds , the bird also emerged , its head struggling to hold onto a large fish . The bird jumped onto the raft and then tried to swallow the fish , but of course , with the ring around its neck , it could not . In one motion , the boy on the raft snatched the fish from the bird 's mouth and threw it to the other boy on thep76boat . I clapped my hands and the bird dove under water again . For the next hour , while Amah and everybody else slept , I watched like a hungry cat waiting its turn , as fish after fish appeared in the bird 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . Then the boy in the water cried to the other , " Enough ! " and the boy on the boat shouted to someone high atop the part of the boat I could not see . And loud clanks and hissing sounds erupted as once again the boat began to move . Then the boy next to me dove into the water . Both boys got on the raft and crouched in the middle like two birds perched on a branch . I waved to them , envying their carefree ways , and soon they were far away , a little yellow spot bobbing on the water . It would have been enough to see this one adventure . But I stayed , as if caught in a good dream . And sure enough , I turned around and a sullen woman was now squatting in front of the bucket of fish . I watched as she took out a sharp , thin knife and began to slice open the fish bellies , pulling out the red slippery insides and throwing them over her shoulder into the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew in the air like shards of glass . And then there were two chickens that no longer gurgled after their heads were chopped off . And a big snapping turtle that stretched out its neck to bite a stick , and  --  whuck !  --  off fell its head . And dark masses of thin freshwater eels , swimming furiously in a pot . Then the woman carried everything , without a word , into the kitchen . And there was nothing else to see . It was not until then , too late , that I saw my new clothes  --  and the spots of bloods , flecks of fish scales , bits of feather and mud . What a strange mind I had ! In my panic , in hearing waking voices toward the front of the boat , I quickly dipped my hands in the bowl of turtle 's blood and smeared this on my sleeves , and on the front of my pants and jacket . And this is what I truly thought : that I could cover these spots by painting all my clothes crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would notice this change . That is how Amah found me : an apparition covered with blood . I can still hear her voice , screaming in terror , running over to see what pieces of my body were missing , what leaky holes hadp77appeared . And when she found nothing , after inspecting my ears and my nose and counting my fingers , she called me names , using words I had never heard before . But they sounded evil , the way she hurled and spat the words out . She yanked off my jacket , pulled off my pants . She said I smelled like " something evil this " and I looked like " something evil that . " Her voice was trembling not so much with anger as with fear . " Your mother , now she will be glad to wash her hands of you , " Amah said with great remorse . " She will banish us both to Kunming . " And then I was truly frightened , because I had heard that Kunming was so far away nobody ever came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a stone forest ruled by monkeys . Amah left me crying on the back of the boat , standing in my white cotton undergarments and tiger slippers . I had truly expected my mother to come soon . I imagined her seeing my soiled clothes , the little flowers she had worked so hard to make . I thought she would come to the back of the boat and scold me in her gentle way . But she did not come . Oh , once I heard some footsteps , but I saw only the faces of my halfsisterspressed to the door window . They looked at me wideeyed , pointed to me , and then laughed and scampered off . The water had turned a deep golden color , and then red , purple , and finally black . The sky had darkened and red lantern lights started to glow all over the lake . I could hear people talking and laughing , some voices from the front of our boat , some from other boats next to us . And then I heard the wooden kitchen door banging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells . The voices from the pavilion cried in happy disbelief , " Ai ! Look at this ! And this ! " I was hungry to be there . I listened to their banquet while dangling my legs over the back . And although it was night , it was bright outside . I could see my reflection , my legs , my hands leaning on the edge , and my face . And above my head , I saw why it was so bright . In the dark water , I could see the full moon , a moon so warm and big it looked like the sun . And I turned around so I could find the Moon Lady and tell her my secret wish . But right at that mo/ment , everybody else must have seen her too . Because firecrackersexploded , and I fell into the water not even hearing my own splash . I was surprised by the cool comfort of the water , so that at first I was not frightened . It was like weightless sleep . And I expected Amah to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I began to choke , I knew she would not come . I thrashed my arms and legs under the water . The sharp water had swum up my nose , into my throat and eyes , and this made me thrash even harder . " Amah ! " I tried to cry and I was so angry at her for abandoning me , for making me wait and suffer unnecessarily . And then a dark shape brushed by me and I knew it was one of the Five Evils , a swimming snake . It wrapped around me and squeezed my body like a sponge , then tossed me into the choking air  --  and I fell headlong into a rope net filled with writhing fish . Water gushed out of my throat , so that now I was choking and wailing . When I turned my head , I saw four shadows , with the moon in back of them . A dripping figure was climbing into the boat . " Is it too small ? Should we throw it back ? Or is it worth some money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others laughed . I became quiet . I knew who these people were . When Amah and I passed people like these in the streets , she would put her hands over my eyes and ears . " Stop now , " scolded the woman in the boat , " you 've frightenedher . She thinks we 're brigands who are going to sell her for a slave . " And then she said in a gentle voice , " Where are you from , little sister ? " The dripping man bent down and looked at me . " Oh , a little girl . Not a fish ! " " Not a fish ! Not a fish ! " murmured the others , chuckling . I began to shiver , too scared to cry . The air smelled dangerous , the sharp odors of gunpowder and fish . " Do not pay any attention to them , " said the woman . " Are you from another fishing boat ? Which one ? Do not be afraid . Point . " Out on the water I saw rowboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one , with a long bow and small house in the middle . I looked hard , my heart beating fast.  | " There ! " I said , and pointed to a floating pavilion filled with laughing people and lanterns . " There ! There ! " And I began to cry , desperate to reach my family and be comforted . The fishing boat glided swiftly over , toward the good cooking smells . " E ! " called the woman up to the boat . " Have you lost a little girl , a girl who fell in the water ? " There were some shouts from the floating pavilion , and I strained to see faces of Amah , Baba ; Mama . People were crowded on one side of the pavilion , leaning over , pointing , looking into our boat . All strangers , laughing red faces , loud voices . Where was Amah ? Why did my mother not come ? A little girl pushed her way through some legs . " That 's not me ! " she cried . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The people in the boat roared with laughter and turned away . " Little sister , you were mistaken , " said the woman as the fishing boat glided away . I said nothing . I began to shiver again . I had seen nobody who cared that I was missing . I looked out over the water at the hundreds of dancing lanterns . Firecrackers were exploding and I could hear more people laughing . The farther we glided , the bigger the world became . And I now felt I was lost forever . The woman continued to stare at me . My braid was unfurled . My undergarments were wet and gray . I had lost my slippers and was barefoot . " What shall we do ? " said one of the men quietly . " Nobody to claim her . " " Maybe she is a beggar girl , " said one of the men . " Look at her clothes . She is one of those children who ride the flimsy rafts to beg for money . " I was filled with terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beggar girl , lost without my family . " Anh ! Do n't you have eyes ? " said the woman crossly . " Look at her skin , too pale . And her feet , the bottoms are soft . " " Put her on the shore , then , " said the man . " If she truly has a family , they will look for her there . " " Such a night ! " sighed another man . " Always someone falling in on holiday nights . Drunken poets and little children . Luckyp80she did n't drown . " They chatted like this , back and forth , movingslowly toward shore . One man pushed the boat with a long bamboo pole and we glided between other boats . When we reached the dock , the man who had fished me out of the water lifted me out of the boat with his fishy-smelling hands . " Be careful next time , little sister , " called the woman as their boat glided away . On the dock , with the bright moon behind me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , shrunken and wildlooking . We ran together over to some bushes along a walkway and hid . In this hiding place I could hear people talking as they walked by . I could hear frogs and crickets . And then  --  flutes and tinkling cymbals , a sounding gong and drums ! I looked through the branches of the bushes and in front I could see a crowd of people and , above them , a stage holding up the moon . A young man burst out from the side of a stage and told the crowd , " And now the Moon Lady will come and tell her sad tale to you , in a shadow play , classically sung . " The Moon Lady ! I thought , and the very sound of those magic words made me forget my troubles . I heard more cymbals and gongs and then a shadow of a woman appeared against the moon . Her hair was undone and she was combing it . She began to speak . Such a sweet , wailing voice ! " My fate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long fingers through her hair , " to live here on the moon , while my husband lives on the sun . So that each day and each night , we pass each other , never seeing one another , except this one evening , the night of the mid-autumn moon . " The crowd moved closer . The Moon Lady plucked her lute and began her singing tale . On the other side of the moon I saw the silhouette of a man appear . The Moon Lady held her arms out to embrace him  --  " 0 ! Hou Yi , my husband , Master Archer of the Skies ! " she sang . But her husband did not seem to notice her . He was gazing at the sky . And as the sky grew brighter , his mouth began to open wide  --  in horror or delight , I could not tell . The Moon Lady clutched her throat and fell into a heap ,  |p81crying  , " The drought of ten suns in the eastern sky ! " And just as she sang this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine suns which burst open with blood . " Sinking into a simmering sea ! " she sang happily , and I could hear these suns sizzling and crackling in death . And now a fairy  --  the Queen Mother of the Western Skies !  --  was flying toward the Master Archer . She opened a box and held up a glowing ball  --  no , not a baby sun but a magic peach , the peach of everlasting life ! I could see the Moon Lady pretending to be busy with her embroidery , but she was watching her husband . She saw him hide the peach in a box . And then the Master Archer raised his bow and vowed to fast for one year to show he had the patience to live forever . And after he ran off , the Moon Lady wasted not one moment to find the peach and eat it ! As soon as she tasted it , she began to rise , then fly  --  not like the Queen Mother  --  but like a dragonfly with broken wings . " Flung from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her husband dashed back home , shouting , " Thief ! Lifestealingwife ! " He picked up his bow , aimed an arrow at his wife and  --  with the rumblings of a gong , the sky went black . Wyah ! Wyah ! The sad lute music began again as the sky on the stage lightened . And there stood the poor lady against a moon as bright as the sun . Her hair was now so long it swept the floor , wiping up her tears . An eternity had passed since she last saw her husband , for this was her fate : to stay lost on the moon , forever seeking her own selfish wishes . " For woman is yin , " she cried sadly , " the darkness within , where untempered passions lie . And man is yang , bright truth lighting our minds . " At the end of her singing tale , I was crying , shaking with despair . Even though I did not understand her entire story , I understood her grief . In one small moment , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to get it back . A gong sounded , and the Moon Lady bowed her head and looked serenely to the side . The crowd clapped vigorously . And now the same young man as before came out on the stage andp82announced , " Wait , everybody ! The Moon Lady has consented to grant one secret wish to each person here . . . . " The crowd stirred with excitement , people murmuring in high voices . " For a small monetary donation . . . " continued the young man . And the crowd laughed and groaned , then began to disperse . The young man shouted , " A once-a-year opportunity ! " But nobody was listening to him , except my shadow and me in the bushes . " I have a wish ! I have one ! " I shouted as I ran forward in my bare feet . But the young man paid no attention to me and walked off the stage . I kept running toward the moon to tell the Moon Lady what I wanted , because now I knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the stage , to the other side of the moon . I saw her , standing still for just a moment . She was beautiful , ablaze with the light from a dozen kerosene lamps . And then she shook her long shadowy tresses and began to walk down the steps . " I have a wish , " I said in a whisper , and still she did not hear me . So I walked closer yet , until I could see the face of the Moon Lady : shrunken cheeks , a broad oily nose , large glaring teeth , and red-stained eyes . A face so tired that she wearily pulled off her hair , her long gown fell from her shoulders . And as the secret wish fell from my lips , the Moon Lady looked at me and became a man . For many years , I could not remember what I wanted that night from the Moon Lady , or how it was that I was found again by my family . Both of these things seemed an illusion to me , a wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I was found  --  later that night after Amah , Baba , Uncle , and the others shouted for me along the waterway  --  I never believed my family found the same girl . And then , over the years , I forgot the rest of what happened that day : the pitiful story the Moon Lady sang , the pavilion boat , the bird with the ring on its neck , the tiny flowers blooming on my sleeve , the burning of the Five Evils.  |p83But  now that I am old , moving every year closer to the end of my life , I also feel closer to the beginning . And I remember everything that happened that day because it has happened many times in my life . The same innocence , trust , and restlessness , the wonder , fear , and loneliness . How I lost myself . I remember all these things . And tonight , on the fifteenth day of the eighth moon , I also remember what I asked the Moon Lady so long ago . I wished to be found.  |p89Rules  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of invisible strength . It was a strategy for winning arguments , respect from others , and eventually , though neither of us knew it at the time , chess games . " Bite back your tongue , " scolded my mother when I cried loudly , yanking her hand toward the store that sold bags of salted plums . At home , she said , " Wise guy , he not go against wind . In Chinese we say , Come from South , blow with wind  --  poom !  --  North will follow . Strongest wind can not be seen . " The next week I bit back my tongue as we entered the store with the forbidden candies . When my mother finished her shopping , she quietly plucked a small bag of plums from the rack and put it on the counter with the rest of the items . My mother imparted her daily truths so she could help my older brothers and me rise above our circumstances . We lived in San Francisco 's Chinatown . Like most of the other Chinese children who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think we were poor . My bowl was always full , three five-course meals every day , beginning with a soup full of mysterious things I did n't want to know the names of . We lived on Waverly Place , in a warm , clean , two-bedroomp90flat that sat above a small Chinese bakery specializing in steamed pastries and dim sum . In the early morning , when the alley was still quiet , I could smell fragrant red beans as they were cooked down to a pasty sweetness . By daybreak , our flat was heavy with the odor of fried sesame balls and sweet curried chicken crescents . From my bed , I would listen as my father got ready for work , then locked the door behind him , one-two-three clicks . At the end of our two-block alley was a small sandlot playgroundwith swings and slides well-shined down the middle with use . The play area was bordered by wood-slat benches where old-country people sat cracking roasted watermelon seeds with their golden teeth and scattering the husks to an impatient gathering of gurgling pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley itself . It was crammed with daily mysteries and adventures . My brothers and I would peer into the medicinal herb shop , watching old Li dole out onto a stiff sheet of white paper the right amount of insect shells , saffron-colored seeds , and pungent leaves for his ailing customers . It was said that he once cured a woman dying of an ancestral curse that had eluded the best of American doctors . Next to the pharmacy was a printer who specialized in gold-embossed wedding invitations and festivered banners . Farther down the street was Ping Yuen Fish Market . The front window displayed a tank crowded with doomed fish and turtles struggling to gain footing on the slimy green-tiled sides . A hand-written sign informed tourists , " Within this store , is all for food , not for pet . " Inside , the butchers with their bloodstainedwhite smocks deftly gutted the fish while customers cried out their orders and shouted , " Give me your freshest , " to which the butchers always protested , " All are freshest . " On less crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frogs and crabs which we were warned not to poke , boxes of dried cuttlefish , and row upon row of iced prawns , squid , and slippery fish . The sanddabs made me shiver each time ; their eyes lay on one flattenedside and reminded me of my mother 's story of a careless girl who ran into a crowded street and was crushed by a cab . " Was smash flat , " reported my mother.  |p91At  the corner of the alley was Hong Sing 's , a four-table cafe with a recessed stairwell in front that led to a door marked " Tradesmen . " My brothers and I believed the bad people emerged from this door at night . Tourists never went to Hong Sing 's , since the menu was printed only in Chinese . A Caucasian man with a big camera once posed me and my playmates in front of the restaurant . He had us move to the side of the picture window so the photo would capture the roasted duck with its head dangling from a juice-covered rope . After he took the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and eat dinner . When . he smiled and asked me what they served , I shouted , " Guts and duck 's feet and octopus gizzards ! " Then I ran off with my friends , shrieking with laughter as we scampered across the alley and hid in the entryway grotto of the China Gem Company , my heart pounding with hope that he would chase us . My mother named me after the street that we lived on : WaverlyPlace Jong , my official name for important American documents . But my family called me Meimei , " Little Sister . " I was the youngest , the only daughter . Each morning before school , my mother would twist and yank on my thick black hair until she had formed two tightly wound pigtails . One day , as she struggled to weave a hard-toothed comb through my disobedient hair , I had a sly thought . I asked her , " Ma , what is Chinese torture ? " My mother shook her head . A bobby pin was wedged between her lips . She wetted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pushed the pin in so that it nicked sharply against my scalp . " Who say this word ? " she asked without a trace of knowing how wicked I was being . I shrugged my shoulders and said , " Some boy in my class said Chinese people do Chinese torture . " " Chinese people do many things , " she said simply . " Chinese people do business , do medicine , do painting . Not lazy like American people . We do torture . Best torture . " My older brother Vincent was the one who actually got the chess set . We had gone to the annual Christmas party held at the First Chinese Baptist Church at the end of the alley . Thep92missionary ladies had put together a Santa bag of gifts donated by members of another church . None of the gifts had names on them . There were separate sacks for boys and girls of different ages . One of the Chinese parishioners had donned a Santa Claus costume and a stiff paper beard with cotton balls glued to it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing were too young to know that Santa Claus was not Chinese . When my turn came up , the Santa man asked me how old I was . I thought it was a trick question ; I was seven according to the American formula and eight by the Chinese calendar . I said I was born on March 17 , 1951 . That seemed to satisfy him . He then solemnly asked if I had been a very , very good girl this year and did I believe in Jesus Christ and obey my parents . I knew the only answer to that . I nodded back with equal solemnity . Having watched the other children opening their gifts , I already knew that the big gifts were not necessarily the nicest ones . One girl my age got a large coloring book of biblical characters , while a less greedy girl who selected a smaller box received a glass vial of lavender toilet water . The sound of the box was also important . A ten-year-old boy had chosen a box that jangled when he shook it . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . He must have thought it was full of dimes and nickels , because when he saw that it had just ten pennies , his face fell with such undisguised disappointment that his mother slapped the side of his head and led him out of the church hall , apologizing to the crowd for her son who had such bad manners he could n't appreciate such a fine gift . As I peered into the sack , I quickly fingered the remaining presents , testing their weight , imagining what they contained . I chose a heavy , compact one that was wrapped ' in shiny silver foil and a red satin ribbon . It was a twelve-pack of Life Savers and I spent the rest of the party arranging and rearranging the candy tubes in the order of my favorites . My brother Winston chose wisely as well . His present turned out to be a box of intricate plastic parts ; the instructions on the box proclaimed that when they were properly assembled he would have an authentic miniature replica of a World War II submarine.  |p93Vincent  got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent present to get at a church Christmas party , except it was obviously used and , as we discovered later , it was missing a black pawn and a white knight . My mother graciously thanked the unknown benefactor , saying , " Too good . Cost too much . " At which point , an old lady with fine white , wispy hair nodded toward our family and said with a whistling whisper , " Merry , merry Christmas . " When we got home , my mother told Vincent to throw the chess set away . " She not want it . We not want it , " she said , tossing her head stiffly to the side with a tight , proud smile . My brothers had deaf ears . They were already lining up the chess pieces and reading from the dog-eared instruction book . I watched Vincent and Winston play during Christmas week . The chess board seemed to hold elaborate secrets waiting to be untangled . The chessmen were more powerful than Old Li 's magic herbs that cured ancestral curses . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at stake that was greater than avoiding the tradesmen 's door to Hong Sing 's . " Let me ! Let me ! " I begged between games when one brother or the other would sit back with a deep sigh of relief and victory , the other annoyed , unable to let go of the outcome . Vincent at first refused to let me play , but when I offered my Life Savers as replacements for the buttons that filled in for the missing pieces , he relented . He chose the flavors : wild cherry for the black pawn and peppermint for the white knight . Winner could eat both . As our mother sprinkled flour and rolled out small doughy circles for the steamed dumplings that would be our dinner that night , Vincent explained the rules , pointing to each piece . " You have sixteen pieces and so do I. One king and queen , two bishops , two knights , two castles , and eight pawns . The pawns can only move forward one step , except on the first move Then they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving crossways like this , except in the beginning , when you can move ahead and take another pawn . "  | " Why ? " I asked as I moved my pawn . " Why ca n't they move more steps ? " " Because they 're pawns , " he said . " But why do they go crossways to take other men . Why are n't there any women and children ? " " Why is the sky blue ? Why must you always ask stupid questions ? " asked Vincent . " This is a game . These are the rules . I did n't make them up . See . Here . In the book . " He jabbed a page with a pawn in his hand . " Pawn . P-A-W-N . Pawn . Read it yourself . " My mother patted the flour off her hands . " Let me see book , " she said quietly . She scanned the pages quickly , not reading the foreign English symbols , seeming to search deliberately for nothing in particular . " This American rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out from foreign country , must know rules . You not know , judge say , Too bad , go back . They not telling you why so you can use their way go forward . They say , Do n't know why , you find out yourself . But they knowing all the time . Better you take it , find out why yourself . " She tossed her head back with a satisfied smile . I found out about all the whys later . I read the rules and looked up all the big words in a dictionary . I borrowed books from the Chinatown library . I studied each chess piece , trying to absorb the power each contained . I learned about opening moves and why it 's important to controlthe center early on ; the shortest distance between two points is straight down the middle . I learned about the middle game and why tactics between two adversaries are like clashing ideas ; the one who plays better has the clearest plans for both attacking and getting out of traps . I learned why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical understanding of all possible moves , and patience ; all weaknesses and advantages become evident to a strong adversary and are obscured to a tiring opponent . I discovered that for the whole game one must gather invisible strengths and see the endgame before the game begins . I also found out why I should never reveal " why " to others.  |p95A  little knowledge withheld is a great advantage one should store for future use . That is the power of chess . It is a game of secrets in which one must show and never tell . I loved the secrets I found within the sixty-four black and white squares . I carefully drew a handmade chessboard and pinned it to the wall next to my bed , where at night I would stare for hours at imaginary battles . Soon I no longer lost any games or Life Savers , but I lost my adversaries . Winston and Vincent decided they were more interested in roaming the streets after school in their Hopalong Cassidy cowboy hats . On a cold spring afternoon , while walking home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our alley . I saw a group of old men , two seated across a folding table playing a game of chess , others smoking pipes , eating peanuts , and watching . I ran home and grabbed Vincent 's chess set , which was bound in a cardboard box with rubber bands . I also carefully selected two prized rolls of Life Savers . I came back to the park and approached a man who was observing the game . " Want to play ? " I asked him . His face widened with surprise and he grinned as he looked at the box under my arm . " Little sister , been a long time since I play with dolls , " he said , smiling benevolently . I quickly put the box down next to him on the bench and displayed my retort . Lau Po , as he allowed me to call him , turned out to be a much better player than my brothers . I lost many games and many Life Savers . But over the weeks , with each diminishing roll of candies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names . The Double Attack from the East and West Shores . Throwing Stones on the Drowning Man . The Sudden Meeting of the Clan . The Surprise from the Sleeping Guard . The Humble Servant Who Kills the King . Sand in the Eyes of Advancing Forces . A Double Killing Without Blood . There were also the fine points of chess etiquette . Keep capturedmen in neat rows , as well-tended prisoners . Never announce " Check " with vanity , lest someone with an unseen sword slit your throat . Never hurl pieces into the sandbox after youp96have lost a game , because then you must find them again , by yourself , after apologizing to all around you . By the end of the summer , Lau Po had taught me all he knew , and I had become a better chess player . A small weekend crowd of Chinese people and tourists would gather as I played and defeated my opponents one by one . My mother would join the crowds during these outdoor exhibition games . She sat proudly on the bench , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A man who watched me play in the park suggested that my mother allow me to play in local chess tournaments . My mother smiled graciously , an answer that meant nothing . I desperately wanted to go , but I bit back my tongue . I knew she would not let me play among strangers . So as we walked home I said in a small voice that I did n't want to play in the local tournament . They would have American rules . If I lost , I would bring shame on my family . " Is shame you fall down nobody push you , " said my mother . During my first tournament , my mother sat with me in the front row as I waited for my turn . I frequently bounced my legs to unstick them from the cold metal seat of the folding chair . When my name was called , I leapt up . My mother unwrapped something in her lap . It was her chang , a small tablet of red jade which held the sun 's fire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my dress pocket . I turned to my opponent , a fifteen-yearoldboy from Oakland . He looked at me , wrinkling his nose . As I began to play , the boy disappeared , the color ran out of the room , and I saw only my white pieces and his black ones waiting on the other side . A light wind began blowing past my ears . It whispered secrets only I could hear . " Blow from the South , " it murmured . " The wind leaves no trail . " I saw a clear path , the traps to avoid . The crowd rustled . " Shhh ! Shhh ! " said the corners of the room . The wind blew stronger . " Throw sand from the East to distract him . " The knight came forward ready for the sacrifice . The wind hissed , louder and louder . " Blow , blow , blow . He can not see . He is blind now . Make him lean away from the wind so he is easier to knock down . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with laughter . The wind died down to little puffs , my own breath . My mother placed my first trophy next to a new plastic chess set that the neighborhood Tao society had given to me . As she wiped each piece with a soft cloth , she said , " Next time win more , lose less . " " Ma , it 's not how many pieces you lose , " I said . " Sometimes you need to lose pieces to get ahead . " " Better to lose less , see if you really need . " At the next tournament , I won again , but it was my mother who wore the triumphant grin . " Lost eight piece this time . Last time was eleven . What I tell you ? Better off lose less ! " I was annoyed , but I could n't say anything . I attended more tournaments , each one farther away from home . I won all games , in all divisions . The Chinese bakery downstairs from our flat displayed my growing collection of trophiesin its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . The day after I won an important regional tournament , the window encased a fresh sheet cake with whippedcreamfrosting and red script saying , " Congratulations , Waverly Jong , Chinatown Chess Champion . " Soon after that , a flower shop , headstone engraver , and funeral parlor offered to sponsor me in national tournaments . That 's when my mother decided I no longer had to do the dishes . Winston and Vincent had to do my chores . " Why does she get to play and we do all the work , " complainedVincent . " Is new American rules , " said my mother . " Meimei play , squeeze all her brains out for win chess . You play , worth squeeze towel . " By my ninth birthday , I was a national chess champion . I was still some 429 points away from grand-master status , but I was touted as the Great American Hope , a child prodigy and a girl to boot . They ran a photo of me in Life magazine next to a quote in which Bobby Fischer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . " " Your move , Bobby , " said the caption.  |p98The  day they took the magazine picture I wore neatly plaited braids clipped with plastic barrettes trimmed with rhinestones . I was playing in a large high school auditorium that echoed with phlegmy coughs and the squeaky rubber knobs of chair legs sliding across freshly waxed wooden floors . Seated across from me was an American man , about the same age as Lau Po , maybe fifty . I remember that his sweaty brow seemed to weep at my every move . He wore a dark , malodorous suit . One of his pockets was stuffed with a great white kerchief on which he wiped his palm before sweeping his hand over the chosen chess piece with great flourish . In my crisp pink-and-white dress with scratchy lace at the neck , one of two my mother had sewn for these special occasions , I would clasp my hands under my chin , the delicate points of my elbows poised lightly on the table in the manner my mother had shown me for posing for the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth like an impatient child riding on a school bus . Then I would pause , suck in my lips , twirl my chosen piece in midair as if undecided , and then firmly plant it in its new threatening place , with a triumphant smile thrown back at my opponent for good measure . I no longer played in the alley of Waverly Place . I never visited the playground where the pigeons and old men gathered . I went to school , then directly home to learn new chess secrets , cleverly concealed advantages , more escape routes . But I found it difficult to concentrate at home . My mother had a habit of standing over me while I plotted out my games . I think she thought of herself as my protective ally . Her lips would be sealed tight , and after each move I made , a soft " Hmmmmph " would escape from her nose . " Ma , I ca n't practice when you stand there like that , " I said one day . She retreated to the kitchen and made loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , I could see out of the corner of my eye that she was standing in the doorway . " Hmmmph ! " Only this one came out of her tight throat . My parents made many concessions to allow me to practice.  |p99One  time I complained that the bedroom I shared was so noisy that I could n't think . Thereafter , my brothers slept in a bed in the living room facing the street . I said I could n't finish my rice ; my head did n't work right when my stomach was too full . I left the table with half-finished bowls and nobody complained . But there was one duty I could n't avoid . I had to accompany my mother on Saturday market days when I had no tournament to play . My mother would proudly walk with me , visiting many shops , buying very little . " This my daughter Wave-ly Jong , " she said to whoever looked her way . One day , after we left a shop I said under my breath , " I wish you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother stopped walking . Crowds of people with heavy bags pushed past us on the sidewalk , bumping into first one shoulder , then another . " Aiii-ya . So shame be with mother ? " She grasped my hand even tighter as she glared at me . I looked down . " It 's not that , it 's just so obvious . It 's just so embarrassing . " " Embarrass you be my daughter ? " Her voice was cracking with anger . " That 's not what I meant . That 's not what I said . " " What you say ? " I knew it was a mistake to say anything more , but I heard my voice speaking . " Why do you have to use me to show off ? If you want to show off , then why do n't you learn to play chess . " My mother 's eyes turned into dangerous black slits . She had no words for me , just sharp silence . I felt the wind rushing around my hot ears . I jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun around , knocking into an old woman . Her bag of groceries spilled to the ground . " Aii-ya ! Stupid girl ! " my mother and the woman cried . Orangesand tin cans careened down the sidewalk . As my mother stooped to help the old woman pick up the escaping food , I tookoff . I raced down the street , dashing between people , not looking back as my mother screamed shrilly , " Meimei ! Meimei ! " I fledp100down an alley , past dark curtained shops and merchants washing the grime off their windows . I sped into the sunlight , into a large street crowded with tourists examining trinkets and souvenirs . I ducked into another dark alley , down another street , up another alley . I ran until it hurt and I realized I had nowhere to go , that I was not running from anything . The alleys contained no escape routes . My breath came out like angry smoke . It was cold . I sat down on an upturned plastic pail next to a stack of empty boxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagined my mother , first walking briskly down one street or another looking for me , then giving up and returning home to await my arrival . After two hours , I stood up on creaking legs and slowly walked home . The alley was quiet and I could see the yellow lights shining from our flat like two tiger 's eyes ih the night . I climbed the sixteen steps to the door , advancing quietly up each so as not to make any warning sounds . I turned the knob ; the door was locked . I heard a chair moving , quick steps , the locks turning  --  click ! click ! click !  --  and then the door opened . " About time you got home , " said Vincent . " Boy , are you in trouble . " He slid back to the dinner table . On a platter were the remains of a large fish , its fleshy head still connected to bones swimming upstream in vain escape . Standing there waiting for my punishment , I heard my mother speak in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This girl not have concerning for us . " Nobody looked at me . Bone chopsticks clinked against the insides of bowls being emptied into hungry mouths . I walked into my room , closed the door , and lay down on my bed . The room was dark , the ceiling filled with shadows from the dinnertime lights of neighboring flats . In my head , I saw a chessboard with sixty-four black and white squares . Opposite me was my opponent , two angry black slits . She wore a triumphant smile . " Strongest wind can not be seen , " she said.  |p101Her  black men advanced across the plane , slowly marching to each successive level as a single unit . My white pieces screamed as they scurried and fell off the board one by one . As her men drew closer to my edge , I felt myself growing light . I rose up into the air and flew out the window . Higher and higher , above the alley , over the tops of tiled roofs , where I was gathered up by the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me disappeared and I was alone . I closed my eyes and pondered my next move.  |p102The  Voice fromthe WallWhen I was little , my mother told me my great-grandfather had sentenced a beggar to die in the worst possible way , and that later the dead man came back and killed my great-grandfather . Either that , or he died of influenza one week later . I used to play out the beggar 's last moments over and over again in my head . In my mind , I saw the executioner strip off the man 's shirt and lead him into the open yard . " This traitor , " read the executioner , " is sentenced to die the death of a thousand cuts . " But before he could even raise the sharp sword to whittle his life away , they found the beggar 's mind had already broken into a thousand pieces . A few days later , my great-grandfather looked up from his books and saw this same man looking like a smashed vase hastily put back together . " As the sword was cuttingme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the worst I would ever have to endure . But I was wrong . The worst is on the other side . " And the dead man embraced my great-grandfatherwith the jagged pieces of his arm and pulled him through the wall , to show him what he meant . I once asked my mother how he really died . She said , " In bed , very quickly , after being sick for only two days . " " No , no , I mean the other man . How was he killed ? Did they slice off his skin first ? Did they use a cleaver to chop up his bones ? Did he scream and feel all one thousand cuts ? "  | " Annh ! Why do you Americans have only these morbid thoughts in your mind ? " cried my mother in Chinese . " That man has been dead for almost seventy years . What does it matter how he died ? " I always thought it mattered , to know what is the worst possiblething that can happen to you , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn by the magic of the unspeakable . Because , even as a young child , I could sense the unspoken terrors that surrounded our house , the ones that chased my mother until she hid in a secret dark corner of her mind . And still they found her . I watched , over the years , as they devoured her , piece by piece , until she disappeared and became a ghost . As I remember it , the dark side of my mother sprang from the basement in our old house in Oakland . I was five and my mother tried to hide it from me . She barricaded the door with a wooden chair , secured it with a chain and two types of key locks . And it became so mysterious that I spent all my energies unraveling this door , until the day I was finally able to pry it open with my small fingers , only to immediately fall headlong into the dark chasm . And it was only after I stopped screaming  --  I had seen the blood of my nose on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about the bad man who lived in the basement and why I should never open the door again . He had lived there for thousands of years , she said , and was so evil and hungry that had my mother not rescued me so quickly , this bad man would have planted five babies in me and then eaten us all in a six-course meal , tossing our bones on the dirty floor . And after that I began to see terrible things . I saw these things with my Chinese eyes , the part of me I got from my mother . I saw devils dancing feverishly beneath a hole I had dug in the sandbox . I saw that lightning had eyes and searched to strike down little children . I saw a beetle wearing the face of a child , which I promptly squashed with the wheel of my tricycle . And when I became older , I could see things that Causasian girls at school did not . Monkey rings that would split in two and send a swinging child hurtling through space . Tether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playground in front of laughing friends . I did n't tell anyone about the things I saw , not even my mother . Most people did n't know I was half Chinese , maybe because my last name is St. Clair . When people first saw me , they thought I looked like my father , English-Irish , big-boned and delicate at the same time . But if they looked really close , if they knew that they were there , they could see the Chinese parts . Instead of having cheeks like my father 's sharp-edged points , mine were smooth as beach pebbles . I did n't have his straw-yellow hair or his white skin , yet my coloring looked too pale , like something that was once darker and had faded in the sun . And my eyes , my mother gave me my eyes , no eyelids , as if they were carved on a jack-o ' - lantern with two swift cuts of a short knife . I used to push my eyes in on the sides to make them rounder . Or I 'd open them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when I walked around the house like that , my father asked me why I looked so scared . I have a photo of my mother with this same scared look . My father said the picture was taken when Ma was first released from Angel Island Immigration Station . She stayed there for three weeks , until they could process her papers and determine whether she was a War Bride , a Displaced Person , a Student , or the wife of a Chinese-American citizen . My father said they did n't have rules for dealing with the Chinese wife of a Caucasian citizen . Somehow , in the end , they declared her a Displaced Person , lost in a sea of immigration categories . My mother never talked about her life in China , but my father said he saved her from a terrible life there , some tragedy she could not speak about . My father proudly named her in her immigration papers : Betty St. Clair , crossing out her given name of Gu Ying-ying . And then he put down the wrong birthyear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pen , my mother lost her name and became a Dragon instead of a Tiger . In this picture you can see why my mother looks displaced . She is clutching a large clam-shaped bag , as though someonep105might steal this from her as well if she is less watchful . She has on an ankle-length Chinese dress with modest vents at the side . And on top she is wearing a Westernized suit jacket , awkwardly stylish on my mother 's small body , with its padded shoulders , wide lapels , and oversize cloth buttons . This was my mother 's wedding dress , a gift from my father . In this outfit she looks as if she were neither coming from nor going to someplace . Her chin is bent down and you can see the precise part in her hair , a neat white line drawn from above her left brow then over the black horizon of her head . And even though her head is bowed , humble in defeat , her eyes are staring up past the camera , wide open . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . And my father explained : It was only because he said " Cheese , " and my mother was struggling to keep her eyes open until the flash went off , ten seconds later . My mother often looked this way , waiting for something to happen , wearing this scared look . Only later she lost the struggle to keep her eyes open . " Do n't look at her , " said my mother as we walked through Chinatown in Oakland . She had grabbed my hand and pulled me close to her body . And of course I looked . I saw a woman sitting on the sidewalk , leaning against a building . She was old and young at the same time , with dull eyes as though she had not slept for many years . And her feet and her hands  --  the tips were as black as if she had dipped them in India ink . But I knew they were rotted . " What did she do to herself ? " I whispered to my mother . " She met a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby she did n't want . " And I knew that was not true . I knew my mother made up anything to warn me , to help me avoid some unknown danger . My mother saw danger in everything , even in other Chinese people . Where we lived and shopped , everyone spoke Cantonesep106or English . My mother was from Wushi , near Shanghai . So she spoke Mandarin and a little bit of English . My father , who spoke only a few canned Chinese expressions , insisted my mother learn English . So with him , she spoke in moods and gestures , looks and silences , and sometimes a combination of English punctuatedby hesitations and Chinese frustration : " Shwo buchulai "  --  Words can not come out . So my father would put words in her mouth . " I think Mom is trying to say she 's tired , " he would whisper when my mother became moody . " I think she 's saying we 're the best darn family in the country ! " he 'd exclaim when she had cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were alone , my mother would speak in Chinese , saying things my father could not possibly imagine . I could understand the words perfectly , but not the meanings . One thought led to another without connection . " You must not walk in any direction but to school and back home , " warned my mother when she decided I was old enough to walk by myself . " Why ? " I asked . " You ca n't understand these things , " she said . " Why not ? " " Because I have n't put it in your mind yet . " " Why not ? " " Aii-ya ! Such questions ! Because it is too terrible to consider . A man can grab you off the streets , sell you to someone else , make you have a baby . Then you 'll kill the baby . And when they find this baby in a garbage can , then what can be done ? You 'll go to jail , die there . " I knew this was not a true answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from happening in the future . I often lied when I had to translate for her , the endless forms , instructions , notices from school , telephone calls . " Shemma yisz ? '  --  What meaning ?  --  she asked me when a man at a grocery store yelled at her for opening up jars to smell the insides . I was so embarrassedI told her that Chinese people were not allowed to shop there . When the school sent a notice home about a polio vaccination , I told her the time and place , and added that all stu/dents were now required to use metal lunch boxes , since they had discovered old paper bags can carry polio germs . " We 're moving up in the world , " my father proudly announced , this being the occasion of his promotion to sales supervisor of a clothing manufacturer . " Your mother is thrilled . " And we did move up , across the bay to San Francisco and up a hill in North Beach , to an Italian neighborhood , where the sidewalk was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from school each day . I was ten and I was hopeful that we might be able to leave all the old fears behind in Oakland . The apartment building was three stories high , two apartments per floor . It had a renovated facade , a recent layer of white stucco topped with connected rows of metal fire-escape ladders . But inside it was old . The front door with its narrow glass panes opened into a musty lobby that smelled of everybody 's life mixed together . Everybody meant the names on the front door next to their little buzzers : Anderson , Giordino , Hayman , Ricci , Sorci , and our name , St. Clair . We lived on the middle floor , stuck between cooking smells that floated up and feet sounds that drifted down . My bedroom faced the street , and at night , in the dark , I could see in my mind another life . Cars struggling to climb the steep , fog-shrouded hill , gunning their deep engines and spinning their wheels . Loud , happy people , laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A beagle scrambling to his feet to start his yipping yowl , answered a few seconds later by fire truck sirens and an angry woman hissing , " Sammy ! Bad dog ! Hush now ! " And with all this soothing predictability , I would soon fall asleep . My mother was not happy with the apartment , but I did n't see that at first . When we moved in , she busied herself with getting settled , arranging the furniture , unpacking dishes , hangingpictures on the wall . It took her about one week . And soon after that , when she and I were walking to the bus stop , she met a man who threw her off balance . He was a red-faced Chinese man , wobbling down the sidewalkp108as if he were lost . I lis runny eyes saw us and he quickly stood up straight and threw out his arms , shouting , " I found you ! Suzie Wong , girl of my dreams ! Hah ! " And with his arms and mouth wide open , he started rushing toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body with her arms as if she were naked , unable to do anything else . In that moment as she let go , I started to scream , seeing this dangerous man lunging closer . I was still screaming after two laughing men grabbed this man and , shaking him , said , " Joe , stop it , for Chrissake . You 're scaringthat poor little girl and her maid . " The rest of the day  --  while riding on the bus , walking in and out of stores , shopping for our dinner  --  my mother trembled . She clutched my hand so tightly it hurt . And once when she let go of my hand to take her wallet out of her purse at the cash register , I started to slip away to look at the candy . She grabbed my hand back so fast I knew at that instant how sorry she was that she had not protected me better . As soon as we got home from grocery shopping , she began to put the cans and vegetables away . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cans from one shelf and switched them with the cans on another . Next she walked briskly into the living room and moved a large round mirror from the wall facing the front door to a wall by the sofa . " What are you doing ? " I asked . She whispered something in Chinese about " things not being balanced , " and I thought she meant how things looked , not how things felt . And then she started to move the larger pieces : the sofa , chairs , end tables , a Chinese scroll of goldfish . " What 's going on here ? " asked my father when he came home from work . " She 's making it look better , " I said . And the next day , when I came home from school , I saw she had again rearranged everything . Everything was in a different place . I could see that some terrible danger lay ahead . " Why are you doing this ? " I asked her , afraid she would give me a true answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something goes against your nature , you are not in balance . Thisp109house was built too steep , and a bad wind from the top blows all your strength back down the hill . So you can never get ahead . You are always rolling backward . " And then she started pointing to the walls and doors of the apartment . " See how narrow this doorway is , like a neck that has been strangled . And the kitchen faces this toilet room , so all your worth is flushed away . " " But what does it mean ? What 's going to happen if it 's not balanced ? " I asked my mother . My father explained it to me later . " Your mother is just practicingher nesting instincts , " he said . " All mothers get it . You 'll see when you 're older . " I wondered why my father never worried . Was he blind ? Why did my mother and I see something more ? And then a few days later , I found out that my father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walked into my bedroom , and saw it . My mother had rearranged my room . My bed was no longer by the window but against a wall . And where my bed once was  --  now there stood a used crib . So the secret danger was a ballooning stomach , the source of my mother 's imbalance . My mother was going to have a baby . " See , " said my father as we both looked at the crib . " Nesting instincts . Here 's the nest . And here 's where the baby goes . " He was so pleased with this imaginary baby in the crib . He did n't see what I later saw . My mother began to bump into things , into table edges as if she forgot her stomach contained a baby , as if she were headed for trouble instead . She did not speak of the joys of having a new baby ; she talked about a heaviness around her , about things being out of balance , not in harmony with one another . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's stomach and this crib in my room . With my bed against the wall , the nighttime life of my imaginationchanged . Instead of street sounds , I began to hear voices coming from the wall , from the apartment next door . The frontdoorbuzzer said a family called the Sorcis lived there . That first night I heard the muffled sound of someone shouting . A woman ? A girl ? I flattened my ear against the wall andp110heard a woman 's angry voice , then another , the higher voice of a girl shouting back . And now , the voices turned toward me , like fire sirens turning onto our street , and I could hear the accusations fading in and out : Who am I to say ! . . . Why do you keep buggin ' met . . . Then get out and stay out ! . . . rather die rather be dead ! . . . Why doncha then ! " Then I heard scraping sounds , slamming , pushing and shouts and then whack ! whack ! whack ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouts , a mother had a sword high above a girl 's head and was starting to slice her life away , first a braid , then her scalp , an eyebrow , a toe , a thumb , the point of her cheek , the slant of her nose , until there was nothing left , no sounds . I lay back against my pillow , my heart pounding at what I had just witnessed with my ears and my imagination . A girl had just been killed . I had n't been able to stop myself from listening . I was n't able to stop what happened . The horror of it all . But the next night , the girl came back to life with more screams , more beating , her life once more in peril . And so it continued , night after night , a voice pressing against my wall telling me that this was the worst possible thing that could happen : the terror of not knowing when it would ever stop . Sometimes I heard this loud family across the hallway that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs going up to the third floor . Ours was by the stairs going down to the lobby . " You break your legs sliding down that banister , I 'm gon na break your neck , " a woman shouted . Her warnings were followed by the sounds of feet stomping on the stairs . " And do n't forget to pick up Pop 's suits ! " I knew their terrible life so intimately that I was startled by the immediacy of seeing her in person for the first time . I was pulling the front door shut while balancing an armload of books . And when I turned around , I saw her coming toward me just a few feet away and I shrieked and dropped everything . She snickeredand I knew who she was , this tall girl whom I guessed top111be about twelve , two years older than I was . Then she bolted down the stairs and I quickly gathered up my books and followed her , careful to walk on the other side of the street . She did n't seem like a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no traces of blood-stained clothes ; she wore a crisp white blouse , a blue cardigan sweater , and a blue-green pleated skirt . In fact , as I watched her , she seemed quite happy , her two brown braids bouncing jauntily in rhythm to her walk . And then , as if she knew that I was thinking about her , she turned her head . She gave me a scowl and quickly ducked down a side street and walked out of my sight . Every time I saw her after that , I would pretend to look down , busy rearranging my books or the buttons on my sweater , guilty that I knew everything about her . My parents ' friends Auntie Su and Uncle Canning picked me up at school one day and took me to the hospital to see my mother . I knew this was serious because everything they said was unnecessary but spoken with solemn importance . " It is now four o'clock , " said Uncle Canning , looking at his watch . " The bus is never on time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , she seemed half asleep , tossing back and forth . And then her eyes popped open , staring at the ceiling . " My fault , my fault . I knew this before it happened , " she babbled . " I did nothing to prevent it . " " Betty darling , Betty darling , " said my father frantically . But my mother kept shouting these accusations to herself . She grabbed my hand and I realized her whole body was shaking . And then she looked at me , in a strange way , as if she were begging me for her life , as if I could pardon her . She was mumbling in Chinese . " Lena , what 's she saying ? " cried my father . For once , he had no words to put in my mother 's mouth.  |p112And  for once , I had no ready answer . It struck me that the worst possible thing had happened . That what she had been fearing had come true . They were no longer warnings . And so I listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she murmured , " I could already hear him screaming inside my womb . His little fingers , they were clinging to stay inside . But the nurses , the doctor , they said to push him out , make him come . And when his head popped out , the nurses cried , His eyes are wide open ! He sees everything ! Then his body slipped out and he lay on the table , steaming with life . " When I looked at him , I saw right away . His tiny legs , his small arms , his thin neck , and then a large head so terrible I could not stop looking at it . This baby 's eyes were open and his head  --  it was open too ! I could see all the way back , to where his thoughts were supposed to be , and there was nothing there . No brain , the doctor shouted ! his head is just an empty eggshell ! " And then this baby , maybe he heard us , his large head seemed to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The head turned to one side , then to the other . It looked right through me . I knew he could see everything inside me . How I had given no thought to killing my other son ! How I had given no thought to having this baby ! " I could not tell my father what she had said . He was so sad already with this empty crib in his mind . How could I tell him she was crazy ? So this is what I translated for him : " She says we must all think very hard about having another baby . She says she hopes this baby is very happy on the other side . And she thinks we should leave now and go have dinner . " After the baby died , my mother fell apart , not all at once , but piece by piece , like plates falling off a shelf one by one . I never knew when it would happen , so I became nervous all the time , waiting . Sometimes she would start to make dinner , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink , her knife poised in the air over half-chopped vegetables , silent , tears flowing . And sometimes we 'd be eating and we would have to stopp113and put our forks down because she had dropped her face into her hands and was saying , " Mei gwansyi "  --  It does n't matter . My father would just sit there , trying to figure out what it was that did n't matter this much . And I would leave the table , knowing it would happen again , always a next time . My father seemed to fall apart in a different way . He tried to make things better . But it was as if he were running to catch things before they fell , only he would fall before he could catch anything . " She 's just tired , " he explained to me when we were eating dinner at the Gold Spike , just the two of us , because my mother was lying like a statue on her bed . I knew he was thinking about her because he had this worried face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with worms instead of spaghetti . At home , my mother looked at everything around her with empty eyes . My father would come home from work , patting my head , saying , " How 's my big girl , " but always looking past me , toward my mother . I had such fears inside , not in my head but in my stomach . I could no longer see what was so scary , but I could feel it . I could feel every little movement in our silent house . And at night , I could feel the crashing loud fights on the other side of my bedroom wall , this girl being beaten to death . In bed , with the blanket edge lying across my neck , I used to wonder which was worse , our side or theirs ? And after thinking about this for a while , after feeling sorry for myself , it comforted me somewhat to think that this girl next door had a more unhappy life . But one night after dinner our doorbell rang . This was curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lena , could you see who it is ? " called my father from the kitchen . He was doing the dishes . My mother was lying in bed . My mother was now always " resting " and it was as if she had died and become a living ghost . I opened the door cautiously , then swung it wide open with surprise . It was the girl from next door . I stared at her with undisguisedamazement . She was smiling back at me , and she looked ruffled , as if she had fallen out of bed with her clothes on.  | " Who is it ? " called my father . " It 's next door ! " 1 shouted to my father . " It 's ... " " Teresa , " she offered quickly . " It 's Teresa ! " I yelled back to my father . " Invite her in , " my father said at almost the same moment that Teresa squeezed past me and into our apartment . Without being invited , she started walking toward my bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braids that were bouncing like whips beating the back of a horse . She walked right over to my window and began to open it . " What are you doing ? " I cried . She sat on the window ledge , looked out on the street . And then she looked at me and started to giggle . I sat down on my bed watching her , waiting for her to stop , feeling the cold air blow in from the dark opening . " What 's so funny ? " I finally said . It occurred to me that perhapsshe was laughing at mc , at my life . Maybe she had listened through the wall and heard nothing , the stagnant silence of our unhappy house . " Why are you laughing ? " I demanded . " My mother kicked me out , " she finally said . She talked with a swagger , seeming to be proud of this fact . And then she snickereda little and said , " We had this fight and she pushed me out the door and locked it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door until I 'm sorry enough to apologize . But I 'm not going to . " " Then what are you going to do ? " I asked breathlessly , certain that her mother would kill her for good this time . " I 'm going to use your fire escape to climb back into my bedroom , " she whispered back . " And she 's going to wait . And when she gets worried , she 'll open the front door . Only I wo n't be there ! I 'll be in my bedroom , in bed . " She giggled again . " Wo n't she be mad when she finds you ? " " Nah , she 'll just be glad I 'm not dead or something . Oh , she 'll pretend to be mad , sort of . We do this kind of stuff all the time . " And then she slipped through my window and soundlessly made her way back home . I stared at the open window for a long time , wondering about her . How could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? Did n't she recognize it would never stop ? I lay down on my bed waiting to hear the screams and shouts . And late at night I was still awake when I heard the loud voices next door . Mrs. Sorci was shouting and crying , You stupida girl . You almost gave me a heart attack . And Teresa was yelling back , I coulda been killed . I almost fell and broke my neck . And then I heard them laughing and crying , crying and laughing , shouting with love . I was stunned . I could almost see them hugging and kissing one another . I was crying for joy with them , because I had been wrong . And in my memory I can still feel the hope that beat in me that night . I clung to this hope , day after day , night after night , year after year . I would watch my mother lying in her bed , babbling to herself as she sat on the sofa . And yet I knew that this , the worst possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad things in my mind , but now I found ways to change them . I still heard Mrs. Sorci and Teresa having terrible fights , but I saw something else . I saw a girl complaining that the pain of not being seen was unbearable . I saw the mother lying in bed in her long flowing robes . Then the girl pulled out a sharp sword and told her mother , " Then you must die the death of a thousand cuts . It is the only way to save you . " The mother accepted this and closed her eyes . The sword came down and sliced back and forth , up and down , whish ! whish ! whisk ! And the mother screamed and shouted , cried out in terror and pain . But when she opened her eyes , she saw no blood , no shredded flesh . The girl said , " Do you see now ? " The mother nodded : " Now I have perfect understanding . I have already experienced the worst . After this , there is no worst possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must come back , to the other side . Then you can see why you were wrong . " And the girl grabbed her mother 's hand and pulled her through the wall.  |p116Half  and HalfAs proof of her faith , my mother used to carry a small leatherette Bible when she went to the First Chinese Baptist Church every Sunday . But later , after my mother lost her faith in God , that leatherette Bible wound up wedged under a too-short table leg , a way for her to correct the imbalances of life . It 's been there for over twenty years . My mother pretends that Bible is n't there . Whenever anyone asks her what it 's doing there , she says , a little too loudly , " Oh , this ? I forgot . " But I know she sees it . My mother is not the best housekeeper in the world , and after all these years that Bible is still clean white . Tonight I 'm watching my mother sweep under the same kitchen table , something she does every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table leg propped up by the Bible . I watch her , sweep after sweep , waiting for the right moment to tell her about Ted and me , that we 're getting divorced ; When I tell her , I know she 's going to say , " This can not be . " And when I Say that it is certainly true , that our marriage is over , I know what else she will say : " Then you must save it . " And even though I know it 's hopeless  --  there 's absolutelyp117nothing left to save  --  I 'm afraid if I tell her that , she 'll still persuade me to try . I think it 's ironic that my mother wants me to fight the divorce . Seventeen years ago she was chagrined when I started dating Ted . My older sisters had dated only Chinese boys from church before getting married . Ted and I met in a politics of ecology class when he leaned over and offered to pay me two dollars for the last week 's notes . I refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was during my second semester at UC Berkeley , where I had enrolled as a liberal arts major and later changed to fine arts . Ted was in his third year in pre-med , his choice , he told me , ever since he dissected a fetal pig in the sixth grade . I have to admit that what I initially found attractive in Ted were precisely the things that made him different from my brothersand the Chinese boys I had dated : his brashness ; the assurednessin which he asked for things and expected to get them ; his opinionated manner ; his angular face and lanky body ; the thickness of his arms ; the fact that his parents immigrated from Tarrytown , New York , not Tientsin , China . My mother must have noticed these same differences after Ted picked me up one evening at my parents ' house . When I returned home , my mother was still up , watching television . " He is American , " warned my mother , as if I had been too blind to notice . A waigoren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And it 's not as if I 'm going to marry him or something . " Mrs. Jordan also had a few words to say . Ted had casually invited me to a family picnic , the annual clan reunion held by the polo fields in Golden Gate Park . Although we had dated only a few times in the last month  --  and certainly had never slept together , since both of us lived at home  --  Jed introduced me to all his relatives as his girlfriend , which , until then , I did n't know I was.  |p118Later  , when Ted and his father went off to play volleyball with the others , his mother took my hand , and we started walking along the grass , away from the crowd . She squeezed my palm warmly but never seemed to look at me . " I 'm so glad to meet you finally , " Mrs. Jordan said . I wanted to tell her I was n't really Ted 's girlfriend , but she went on . " I think it 's nice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . So I hope you wo n't misunderstand what I have to say . And then she spoke quietly about Ted 's future , his need to concentrate on his medical studies , why it would be years before . he could even think about marriage . She assured me she had nothing whatsoever against minorities ; she and her husband , who owned a chain of office-supply stores , personally knew many fine people who were Oriental , Spanish , and even black . But Ted was going to be in one of those professions where he would be judged by a different standard , by patients and other doctors who might not be as understanding as the Jordans were . She said it was so unfortunate the way the rest of the world was , how unpopular the Vietnam War was . " Mrs. Jordan , I am not Vietnamese , " I said softly , even though I was on the verge of shouting . " And I have no intention of marrying your son . When Ted drove me home that day , I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me why , I shrugged . When he pressed me , I told him what his mother had said , verbatim , without comment . " And you 're just going to sit there ! Let my mother decide what 's right ? " he shouted , as if I were a co-conspirator who had turned traitor . I was touched that Ted was so upset . " What should we do ? " I asked , and I had a pained feeling I thought was the beginning of love . In those early months , we clung to each other with a rather silly desperation , because , in spite of anything my mother or Mrs. Jordan could say , there was nothing that really prevented us from seeing one another . With imagined tragedy hovering over us , we became inseparable , two halves creating the whole : yin and yang . I was victim to his hero . I was always in dangerp119and he was always rescuing mc . I would fall and he would lift me up . It was exhilarating and draining . The emotional effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . And that , as much as anything we ever did in bed , was how we made love to each other : conjoined where my weaknesses needed protection . " What should we do ? " I continued to ask him . And within a year of our first meeting we were living together . The month before Ted started medical school at UCSF we were married in the Episcopal church , and Mrs. Jordan sat in the front pew , crying as was expected of the groom 's mother . When Ted finished his residency in dermatology , we bought a run-down threestoryVictorian with a large garden in Ashbury Heights . Ted helped me set up a studio downstairs so I could take in work as a free-lance production assistant for graphic artists . Over the years , Ted decided where we went on vacation . He decided what new furniture we should buy . He decided we should wait until we moved into a better neighborhood before having children . We used to discuss some of these matters , but we both knew the question would boil down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After a while , there were no more discussions . Ted simply decided . And I never thought of objecting . I preferred to ignore the world around me , obsessing only over what was in front of me : my T-square , my X-acto knife , my blue pencil . But last year Ted 's feelings about what he called " decision and responsibility " changed . A new patient had come to him asking what she could do about the spidery veins on her cheeks . And when he told her he could suck the red veins out and make her beautiful again , she believed him . But instead , he accidentallysucked a nerve out , and the left side of her smile fell down and she sued him . After he lost the malpractice lawsuit  --  his first , and a big shock to him I now realize  --  he started pushing me to make decisons . Did I think we should buy an American car or a Japanese car ? Should we change from whole-life to term insurance ? What did I think about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I thought about things , the pros and the cons . But in the endp120I would be so confused , because I never believed there was ever any one right answer , yet there were many wrong ones . So whenever I said , " You decide , " or " I do n't care , " or " Either way is fine with me , " Ted would say in his impatient voice , " No , you decide . You ca n't have it both ways , none of the responsibility , none of the blame . " I could feel things changing between us . A protective veil had been lifted and Ted now started pushing me about everything . He asked me to decide on the most trivial matters , as if he were baiting me . Italian food or Thai . One appetizer or two . Which appetizer . Credit card or cash . Visa or MasterCard . Last month , when he was leaving for a two-day dermatology course in Los Angeles , he asked if I wanted to come along and then quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind , I 'd rather go alone . " " More time to study , " I agreed . " No , because you can never make up your mind about anything , " he said . And I protested , " But it 's only with things that are n't impor-tant . " " Nothing is important to you , then , " he said in a tone of disgust . " Ted , if you want me to go , I 'll go . " And it was as if something snapped in him . " How the hell did we ever get married ? Did you just say I do ' because the minister said repeat after me ' ? What would you have done with your life if I had never married you ? Did it ever occur to you ? " This was such a big leap in logic , between what I said and what he said , that I thought we were like two people standing apart on separate mountain peaks , recklessly leaning forward to throw stones at one another , unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize Ted knew what he was saying all along . He wanted to show me the rift . Because later that evening he called from Los Angeles and said he wanted a divorce . Ever since Ted 's been gone , I 've been thinking , Even if I had expected it , even if I had known what I was going to dop121with my life , it still would have knocked the wind out of me . When something that violent hits you , you ca n't help but lose your balance and fall . And after you pick yourself up , you realize you ca n't trust anybody to save you  --  not your husband , not your mother , not God . So what can you do to stop yourself from tilting and falling all over again ? cam ' My mother believed in God 's will for many years . It was as if she had turned on a celestial faucet and goodness kept pouring out . She said it was faith that kept all these good things coming our way , only I thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " th " sound in " faith . " And later , I discovered that maybe it was fate all along , that faith was just an illusion that somehow you 're in control . I found out the most I could have was hope , and with that I was not denying any possibility , good or bad . I was just saying , If there is a choice , dear God or whatever you are , here 's where the odds should be placed . I remember the day I started thinking this , it was such a revelation to me . It was the day my mother lost her faith in God . She found that things of unquestioned certainty could never be trusted again . We had gone to the beach , to a secluded spot south of the city near Devil 's Slide . My father had read in Sunset magazine that this was a good place to catch ocean perch . And although my father was not a fisherman but a pharmacist 's assistant who had once been a doctor in China , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put his mind to . My mother believed she had nengkan to cook anything my father had a mind to catch . It was this belief in their nengkan that had brought my parents to America . It had enabled them to have seven children and buy a house in the Sunset district with very little money . It had given them the confidence to believe their luck would never run out , that God was on their side , that the house gods had only benevolentthings to report and our ancestors were pleased , thatp122lifetime warranties meant our lucky streak would never break , that all the elements were in balance , the right amount of wind and water . So there we were , the nine of us : my father , my mother , my two sisters , four brothers , and myself , so confident as we walked along our first beach . We marched in single file across the cool gray sand , from oldest to youngest . I was in the middle , fourteen years old . We would have made quite a sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bare feet trudging , nine pairs of shoes in hand , nine black-haired heads turned toward the water to watch the waves tumbling in . The wind was whipping the cotton trousers around my legs and I looked for some place where the sand would n't kick into my eyes . I saw we were standing in the hollow of a cove . It was like a giant howl , cracked in half , the other half washed out to sea . My mother walked toward the right , where the beach was clean , and we all followed . On this side , the wall of the cove curved around and protected the beach from both the rough surf and the wind . And along this wall , in its shadow , was a reef ledge that started at the edge of the beach and continued out past the cove where the waters became rough . It seemed as though a person could walk out to sea on this reef , although it looked very rocky and slippery . On the other side of the cove , the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was pitted with crevices , so when the waves crashed against the wall , the water spewed out of these holes like white gulleys . Thinking back , I remember that this beach cove was a terrible place , full of wet shadows that chilled us and invisible specks that flew into our eyes and made it hard for us to see the dangers . We were all blind with the newness of this experience : a Chinese family trying to act like a typical American family at the beach . My mother spread out an old striped bedspread , which flapped in the wind until nine pairs of shoes weighed it down . My father assembled his long bamboo fishing pole , a pole he had made with his own two hands , remembering its design from his childhood in China . And we children sat huddled shoulder to shoulder on the blanket , reaching into the grocery sack full of bolognap123sandwiches , which we hungrily ate salted with sand from our fingers . Then my father stood up and admired his fishing pole , its grace , its strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the edge of the beach and then onto the reef to the point just before it was wet . My two older sisters , Janice and Ruth , jumped up from the blanket and slapped their thighs to get the sand off . Then they slapped each other 's back and raced off down the beach shrieking . I was about to get up and chase there , but my mother nodded toward my four brothers and reminded me : " Dangsying tamende shenti , " which means " Take care of them , " or literally , " Watch out for their bodies . " These bodies werei the anchors of my life : Matthew , Mark , Luke , and Bing . I fell back onto the sand , groaning as my throat grew tight , as I made the same lament : " Why ? " Why did I have to care for them ? And she gave me the same answer : " Yiding . " I must . Because they were my brothers . My sisters had once taken care of me . How else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what my parents had done for me ? Matthew , Mark , and Luke were twelve , ten , and nine , old enough to keep themselves loudly amused . They had already buried Luke in a shallow grave of sand so that only his head stuck out . Now they were starting to pat together the outlines of a sand-castle wall on top of him . But Bing was only four , easily excitable and easily bored and irritable . He did n't want to play with the other brothers because they had pushed him off to the side , admonishing him , " No , Bing , you 'll just wreck it . " So Bing wandered down the beach , walking stiffly like an ousted emperor , picking up shards of rock and chunks of driftwoodand flinging them with all his might into the , surf . I trailed behind , imagining tidal waves and wondering what I would do if one appeared . I called to Bing every now and then , " Do n't go too close to the water . You 'll get your feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my mother , always worried beyond reason inside , but at the same time talking about the danger as if it were less than it really was . The worry surrounded me , likep124the wall of the cove , and it made me feel everything had been considered and was now safe . My mother had a superstition , in fact , that children were predisposed to certain dangers on certain days , all depending on their Chinese birthdate . It was explained in a little Chinese book called The Twenty-Six Malignant Gates . There , on each page , was an illustration of some terrible danger that awaited young innocentchildren . In the corners was a description written in Chinese , and since I could n't read the characters , I could only see what the picture meant . The same little boy appeared in each picture : climbing a brokentree limb , standing by a falling gate , slipping in a wooden tub , being carried away by a snapping dog , fleeing from a bolt of lightning . And in each of these pictures stood a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a big crease in his forehead , or maybe it was actually that he had two round horns . In one picture , the lizard man was standing on a curved bridge , laughing as he watched the little boy falling forwardover the bridge rail , his slippered feet already in the air . It would have been enough to think that even one of these dangers could befall a child . And even though the birthdates corresponded to only one danger , my mother worried about them all . This was because she could n't figure out how the Chinese dates , based on the lunar calendar , translated into American dates . So by taking them all into account , she had absolute faith she could prevent every one of them . The sun had shifted and moved over the other side of the cove wall . Everything had settled into place . My mother was busy keeping sand from blowing onto the blanket , then shaking sand out of shoes , and tacking corners of blankets back down again with the now clean shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reef , patiently casting out , waiting for nengkan to manifest itself as a fish . I could see small figures farther down on the beach , and I could tell they were my sisters by their two dark heads and yellow pants . My brothers ' shrieks were mixed with those of seagulls . Bing had found an empty soda bottle andp125was using this to dig sand next to the dark cove wall . And I sat on the sand , just where the shadows ended and the sunny part began . Bing was pounding the soda bottle against the rock , so I called to him , " Do n't dig so hard . You 'll bust a hole in the wall and fall all the way to China . " And I laughed when he looked at me as though he thought what I said was true . He stood up and started walking toward the water . He put one foot tentatively on the reef , and I warned him , " Bing . " " I 'm gon na see Daddy , " he protested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the water , " I said . " Stay away from the mean fish . " And I watched as he inched his way along the reef , his back hugging the bumpy cove wall . I still see him , so clearly that I almost feel I can make him stay there forever . I see him standing by the wall , safe , calling to my father , who looks over his shoulder toward Bing . How glad I am that my father is going to watch him for a while ! Bing starts to walk over and then something tugs on my father 's line and he 's reeling as fast as he can . Shouts erupt . Someone has thrown sand in Luke 's face and he 's jumped out of his sand grave and thrown himself on top of Mark , thrashing and kicking . My mother shouts for me to stop them . And right after I pull Luke off Mark , I look up and seei Bing walking alone to the edge of the reef . In the confusion of the fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Bing is doing . Bing walks one , two , three steps . His little body is movingso quickly , as if he spotted something wonderful by the water'sedge . And I think , He 's going to fall in . I 'm expecting it . And just as I think this , his feet are already in the air , in a moment of balance , before he splashes into the sea and disappears without leaving so much as a ripple in the water . I sank to my knees watching that spot where he disappeared , not moving , not saying anything . I could n't make sense of it . Ip126was thinking , Should I run to the water and try to pull him out ? Should I shout to my father ? Can I rise on my legs fast enough ? Can I take it all back and forbid Bing from joining my father on the ledge ? And then my sisters were back , and one of them said , " Where 's Bing ? " There was silence for a few seconds and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water 's edge . I stood there unable to move as my sisters looked by the cove wall , as my brothers scrambled to see what lay behind pieces of driftwood . My mother and father were trying to part the waves with their hands . We were there for many hours . I remember the search boats and the sunset when dusk came . I had never seen a sunset like that : a bright orange flame touching the water 's edge and then fanning out , warming the sea . When it became dark , the boats turned their yellow orbs on and bounced up and down on the dark shiny water . As I look hack , it seems unnatural to think about the colors of the sunset and boats at a time like that . But we all had strange thoughts . My father was calculating minutes , estimating the temperatureof the water , readjusting his estimate of when Bing fell . My sisters were calling , " Bing ! Bing ! " as if he were hiding in some bushes high above the beach cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic books . And when the boats turned off their yellow orbs , my mother went for a swim . She had never swum a stroke in her life , but her faith in her own nengkan convinced her that what these Americans could n't do , she could . She could find Bing . And when the rescue people finally pulled her out of the water , she still had her nengkan intact . Her hair , her clothes , they were all heavy with the cold water , but she stood quietly , calm and regal as a mermaid queen who had just arrived out of the sea . The police called off the search , put us all in our car , and sent us home to grieve . I had expected to be beaten to death , by my father , by my mother , by my sisters and brothers . I knew it was my fault . Ip127had n't watched him closely enough , and yet I saw him . But as we sat in the dark living room , I heard them , one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go fishing , " said my father . " We should n't have gone for a walk , " said Janice , while Ruth blew her nose yet another time . " Why 'd you have to throw sand in my face ? " moaned Luke . " Why 'd you have to make me start a fight ? " And my mother quietly admitted to me , " I told you to stop their fight . I told you to take your eyes off him . " If I had had any time at all to feel a sense of relief , it would have quickly evaporated , because my mother also said , " So now I am telling you , we must go and find him , quickly , tomorrow morning . " And everybody 's eyes looked down . But I saw it as my punishment : to go out with my mother , back to the beach , to help her find Bing 's body . Nothing prepared me for what my mother did the next day . When I woke up , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table was a thermos , a teacup , the white leatheretteBible , and the car keys . " Is Daddy ready ? " I asked . " Daddy 's not coming , " she said . " Then how will we get there ? Who will drive us ? " She picked up the keys and I followed her out the door to the car . I wondered the whole time as we drove to the beach how she had learned to drive overnight . She used no map . She drove smoothly ahead , turning down Geary , then the Great Highway , signaling at all the right times , getting on the Coast Highway and easily winding the car around the sharp curves that often led inexperienced drivers off and over the cliffs . When we arrived at the beach , she walked immediately down the dirt path and over to the end of the reef ledge , where I had seen Bing disappear . She held in her hand the white Bible . And looking out over the water , she called to God , her small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began with " Dear God " and ended with " Amen , " and in between she spoke in Chinese.  | " I have always believed in your blessings , " she praised God in that same tone she used for exaggerated Chinese compliments . " We knew they would come . We did not question them . Your decisions were our decisions . You rewarded us for our faith . " In return we have always tried to show our deepest respect . We went to your house . We brought you money . We sang your songs . You gave us more blessings . And now we have misplaced one of them . We were careless . This is true . We had so many good things , we could n't keep them in our mind all the time . " So maybe you hid him from us to teach us a lesson , to be more careful with your gifts in the future . I have learned this . I have put it in my memory . And now I have come to take Bing back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrifed . And I began to cry when she added , " Forgive us for his bad manners . My daughter , this one standing here , will be sure to teach him better lessons of obedience before he visits you again . " After her prayer , her faith was so great that she saw him , three times , waving to her from just beyond the first wave . " Nale ! "  --  There ! And she would stand straight as a sentinel , until three times her eyesight failed her and Bing turned into a dark spot of churning seaweed . My mother did not let her chin fall down . She walked back to the beach and put the Bible down . She picked up the thermos and teacup and walked to the water 's edge . Then she told me that the night before she had reached back into her life , back when she was a girl in China , and this is what she had found . " I remember a boy who lost his hand in a firecracker accident , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm , his tears , and then I heard his mother 's claim that he would grow back another hand , better than the last . This mother said she would pay back an ancestral debt ten times over . She would use a water treatment to soothe the wrath of Chu Jung , the three-eyed god of fire . And true enough , the next week this boy was riding a bicycle , both hands steering a straight course past my astonished eyes ! " And then my mother became very quiet . She spoke again in a thoughtful , respectful manner.  | " An ancestor of ours once stole water from a sacred well . Now the water is trying to steal back . We must sweeten the temper of the Coiling Dragon who lives in the sea . And then we must make him loosen his coils from Bing by giving him another treasure he can hide . " My mother poured out tea sweetened with sugar into the teacup , and threw this into the sea . And then she opened her fist . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift from her mother , who had died many years before . This ring , she told me , drew coveting stares from women and made them inattentiveto the children they guarded so jealously . This would make the Coiling Dragon forgetful of Bing . She threw the ring into the water . But even with this , Bing did not appear right away . For an hour or so , all we saw was seaweed drifting by . And then I saw her clasp her hands to her chest , and she said in a wondrous voice , " See , it 's because we were watching the wrong direction . " And I too saw Bing trudging wearily at the far end of the beach , his shoes hanging in his hand , his dark head bent over in exhaustion . I could feel what my mother felt . The hunger in our hearts was instantly filled . And then the two of us , before we could even get to our feet , saw him light a cigarette , grow tall , and become a stranger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly as possible . " He 's there , " she said firmly . She pointed to the jagged wall across the water . " I see him . He is in a cave , sitting on a little step above the water . He is hungry and a little cold , but he has learned now not to complain too much . " And then she stood up and started walking across the sandy beach as though it were a solid paved path , and I was trying to follow behind , struggling and stumbling in the soft mounds . She marched up the steep path to where the car was parked , and she was n't even breathing hard as she pulled a large inner tube from the trunk . To this lifesaver , she tied the fishing line from my father 's bamboo pole . She walked back and threw the tube into the sea , holding onto the pole . " This will go where Bing is . I will bring him back , " she saidp130fiercely . I had never heard so much nengkan in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It drifted out , toward the other side of the cove where it was caught by stronger waves . The line became taut and she strained to hold on tight . But the line snapped and then spiraled into the water . We both climbed toward the end of the reef to watch . The tube had now reached the other side of the cove . A big wave smashed it into the wall . The bloated tube leapt up and then it was sucked in , under the wall and into a cavern . It popped out . Over and over again , it disappeared , emerged , glistening black , faithfully reporting it had seen Bing and was going back to try to pluck him from the cave . Over and over again , it dove and popped hack up again , empty but still hopeful . And then , after a dozen or so times , it was sucked into the dark recess , and when it came out , it was torn and lifeless . At that moment , and not until that moment , did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that I 'll never forget . It was one of complete despair and horror , for losing Bing , for being so foolish as to think she could use faith to change fate . And it made me angry  --  so blindingly angry  --  that everything had failed us . I know now that I had never expected to find Bing , just as I know now I will never find a way to save my marriage . My mother tells me , though , that I should still try . " What 's the point ? " I say . " There 's no hope . There 's no reason to keep trying . " " Because you must , " she says . " This is not hope . Not reason . This is your fate . This is your life , what you must do . " " So what can I do ? " And my mother says , " You must think for yourself , what you must do . If someone tells you , then you are not trying . " And then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I think about Bing , how I knew he was in danger , how I let it happen . I think about my marriage , how I had seen the signs ,  |p131really  I had . But I just let it happen . And I think now that fate is shaped half by expectation , half by inattention . But somehow , when you lose something you love , faith takes over . You have to pay attention to what you lost . You have to undo the expectation . My mother , she still pays attention to it . That Bible under the table , I know she sees it . I remember seeing her write in it before she wedged it under . I lift the table and slide the Bible out . I put the Bible on the table , flipping quickly through the pages , because I know it 's there . On the page before the New Testament begins , there 's a section called " Deaths , " and that 's where she wrote " Bing Hsu " lightly , in erasable pencil. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in America . You could open a restaurant . You could work for the government and get good retirement . You could buy a house with almost no money down . You could become rich . You could become instantly famous . " Of course you can be prodigy , too , " my mother told me when I was nine . " You can be best anything . What does Auntie Lindo know ? Her daughter , she is only best tricky . " America was where all my mother 's hopes lay . She had come here in 1949 after losing everything in China : her mother and father , her family home , her first husband , and two daughters , twin baby girls . But she never looked back with regret . There were so many ways for things to get better . We did n't immediately pick the right kind of prodigy . At first my mother thought I could be a Chinese Shirley Temple . We 'd watch Shirley 's old movies on TV as though they were training films . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  You watch . And I would see Shirley tapping her feet , or singing a sailor song , or pursing her lips into a very round 0 while saying , " Oh my goodness . "  | " Ni kan , " said my mother as Shirley 's eyes flooded with tears . " You already know how . Do n't need talent for crying ! " Soon after my mother got this idea about Shirley Temple , she took me to a beauty training school in the Mission district and put me in the hands of a student who could barely hold the scissors without shaking . Instead of getting big fat curls , I emerged with an uneven mass of crinkly black fuzz . My mother dragged me off to the bathroom and tried to wet down my hair . " You look like Negro Chinese , " she lamented , as if I had done this on purpose . The instructor of the beauty training school had to lop off ' these soggy clumps to make my hair even again . " Peter Pan is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I now had hair the length of a boy 's , with straight-across bangs that hung at a slant two inches above my eyebrows . I liked the haircut and it made me actually look forward to my future fame . In fact , in the beginning , I was just as excited as my mother , maybe even more so . I pictured this prodigy part of me as many different images , trying each one on for size . I was a dainty ballerina girl standing by the curtains , waiting to hear the right music that would send me floating on my tiptoes . I was like the Christ child lifted out of the straw manger , crying with holy indignity . I was Cinderella stepping from her pumpkin carriage with sparkly cartoon music filling the air . In all of my imaginings , I was filled with a sense that I would soon become perfect . My mother and father would adore me . I would be beyond reproach . I would never feel the need to sulk for anything . But sometimes the prodigy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and get me out of here , I 'm disappearing for good , " it warned . " And then you 'll always be nothing . " Every night after dinner , my mother and I would sit at the Formica kitchen table . She would present new tests , taking her examples from stories of amazing children she had read in Ripley 's Believe It or Not , or Good Housekeeping , Reader 's Digest , and a dozen other magazines she kept in a pile in our bathroom . My mother got these magazines from people whose houses she cleaned . Andp134since she cleaned many houses each week , we had a great assortment . She would look through them all , searching for stories about remarkable children . The first night she brought out a story about a three-year-old boy who knew the capitals of all the states and even most of the European countries . A teacher was quoted as saying the little boy could also pronounce the names of the foreign cities correctly . " What 's the capital of Finland ? " my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew was the capital of California , because Sacramento was the name of the street we lived on in Chinatown . " Nairobi ! " I guessed , saying the most foreign word I could think of . She checked to see if that was possibly one way to pronounce " Helsinki " before showing me the answer . The tests got harder  --  multiplying numbers in my head , findingthe queen of hearts in a deck of cards , trying to stand on my head without using my hands , predicting the daily temperaturesin Los Angeles , New York , and London . One night I had to look at a page from the Bible for three minutes and then report everything I could remember . " Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance and . . . that 's all I remember , Ma , " I said . And after seeing my mother 's disappointed face once again , something inside of me began to die . I hated the tests , the raised hopes and failed expectations . Before going to bed that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw only my face staring back  --  and that it would always be this ordinary face  --  I began to cry . Such a sad , ugly girl ! I made highpitchednoises like a crazed animal , trying to scratch out the face in the mirror . And then I saw what seemed to be the prodigy side of me  --  because I had never seen that face before . I looked at my reflection , blinking so I could see more clearly . The girl staring back at me was angry , powerful . This girl and I were the same . I had new thoughts , willful thoughts , or rather thoughts filled with lots of won'ts . I wo n't let her change me , I promised myself . I wo n't be what I 'm not.  |p135So  now on nights when my mother presented her tests , I performed listlessly , my head propped on one arm . I pretended to be bored . And I was . I got so bored I started counting the bellows of the foghorns out on the bay while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was comforting and reminded me of the cow jumping over the moon . And the next day , I played a game with myself , seeing , if my mother would give up on me before eight bellows . After a while I usually counted only one , maybe two bellows at most . At last she was beginning to give up hope . Two or three months had gone by without any mention of my being a prodigy again . And then one day my mother was watching The Ed Sullivan Show on TV . The TV was old and the sound kept shorting out . Every time my mother got halfway up from . the sofa to adjust the set , the sound would go back on and Ed would be talking . As soon as she sat down , Ed would go silent again . She got up , the TV broke into loud piano music . She sat down . Silence . Up and down , back and forth , quiet and loud . It was like a stiff embraceless dance between her and the TV set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sound dial . She seemed entranced by the music , a little frenzied piano piece with this mesmerizing quality , sort of quick passages and then teasing lilting ones before it returned to the quick playful parts . " Ni kan , " my mother said , calling me over with hurried hand gestures , " Look here . " I could see why my mother was fascinated by the music . It was being pounded out by a little Chinese girl , about nine years old , with a Peter Pan haircut . The girl had the sauciness of a Shirley Temple . She was proudly modest like a proper Chinese child . And she also did this fancy sweep of a curtsy , so that the fluffy skirt of her white dress cascaded slowly to the floor like the petals of a large carnation . In spite of these warning signs , I was n't worried . Our family had no piano and we could n't afford to buy one , let alone reams of sheet music and piano lessons . So I could be generous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Play note right , but does n't sound good ! No singing sound , " complained my mother . " What are you picking on her for ? " I said carelessly . " She 's pretty good . Maybe she 's not the best , but she 's trying hard . " I knew almost immediately I would be sorry I said that . " Just like you , " she said . " Not the best . Because you not trying . " She gave a little huff as she let go of the sound dial and sat down on the sofa . The little Chinese girl sat down also to play an encore of " Anitra 's Dance " by Grieg . I remember the song , because later on I had to learn how to play it . " Three days after watching The Ed Sullivan Show , my mother told me what my schedule would be for piano lessons and piano practice . She had talked to Mr. Chong , who lived on the first floor of our apartment building . Mr. Chong was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services for weekly lessons and a piano for me to practice on every day , two hours a day , from four until six . When my mother told me this , I felt as though I had been sent to hell . I whined and then kicked my foot a little when I could n't stand it anymore . " Why do n't you like me the way I am ? I 'm not a genius ! I ca n't play the piano . And even if I could , I would n't go on TV if you paid me a million dollars ! " I cried . My mother slapped me . " Who ask you be genius ? " she shouted . " Only ask you be your best . For you sake . You think I want you be genius ? Hnnh ! What for ! Who ask you ! " " So ungrateful , " I heard her mutter in Chinese . " If she had as much talent as she has temper , she would be famous nowtMr . Chong , whom I secretly nicknamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers to the silent music of an invisible orchestra . He looked ancient in my eyes . He had lost most of the hair on top of his head and he wore thick glasses and had eyes that always looked tired and sleepy . But he must have been younger than I thought , since he lived with his mother and was not yet married.  |p137I  met Old Lady Chong once and that was enough . She hadthis peculiar smell like a baby that had done something in itspants . And her fingers felt like a dead person 's , like an old peachI once found in the back of the refrigerator ; the skin just slid off the meat when I picked it up . I soon found out why Old ( Thong had retired from teachingpiano . He was deaf . " Like Beethoven ! " he shouted to me . " We 're both listening only in our head ! " And he would start toconduct his frantic silent sonatas . Our lessons went like this . He would open the book and pointto different things , explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sharps or flats ! So this is C major ! Listen now and play afterme ! " And then he would play the C scale a few times , a simplechord , and then , as if inspired by an old , unreachable itch , hegradually added more notes and running trills and a poundingbass until the music was really something quite grand . I would play after him , the simple scale , the simple chordand then I just played some nonsense that sounded like a cat running up and down on top of garbage cans . Old Chong smiledand applauded and then said , " Very good ! But now you must learn to keep time ! " So that 's how I discovered that Old Chong 's eyes were too slow to keep up with the wrong notes I was playing . He went through the motions in half-time . To help me keep rhythm , hestood behind me , pushing down on my right shoulder for every beat . He balanced pennies on top of my wrists so I would keepthem still as I slowly played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around an apple and keep that shape when playingchords . He marched stiffly to show me how to make each finger dance up and down , staccato like an obedient little soldier . He taught me all these things , and that was how I also learned I could be lazy and get away with mistakes , lots of mistakes . If I hit the wrong notes because I had n't practiced enough , I never corrected myself . I just kept playing in rhythm . And Old Chong kept conducting his own private reverie . So maybe I never really gave myself a fair chance . I did pick up the basics pretty quickly , and I might have become a goodp138pianist at that young age . But I was so determined not to try , not to be anybody different that I learned to play only the most ear-splitting preludes , the most discordant hymns . Over the next year , I practiced like this , dutifully in my own way . And then one day I heard my mother and her friend Lindo Jong both talking in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was after church , and I was leaning against the brick wall wearing a dress with stiff white petticoats . Auntie Lindo 's daughter , Waverly , who was about my age , was standing farther down the wall about five feet away . We had grown up together and shared all the closeness of two sisters squabbling over crayons and dolls . In other words , for the most part , we hated each other . I thought she was snotty . Waverly Jong had gained a certain amount of fame as " Chinatown 's Littlest Chinese Chess Champion . " She bring home too many trophy , " lamented Auntie Lindo that Sunday . " All day she play chess . All day I have no time do nothing but dust off her winnings . " She threw a scolding look . at Waverly , who pretended not to see her . " You lucky you do n't have this problem , " said Auntie Lindo with a sigh to my mother . And my mother squared her shoulders and bragged : " Our problem worser than yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but music . It 's like you ca n't stop this natural talent . " And right then , I was determined to put a stop to her foolish pride . A few weeks later , Old Chong and my mother conspired to have me play in a talent show which would be held in the church hall . By then , my parents had saved up enough to buy me a secondhand piano , a black Wurlitzer spinet with a scarred bench . It was the showpiece of our living room . For the talent show , I was to play a piece called " Pleading Child " from Schumann 's Scenes from Childhood . It was a simple , moody piece that sounded more difficult than it was . I was supposed to memorize the whole thing , playing the repeat partsp139twice to make the piece sound longer . But I dawdled over it , playing a few bars and then cheating , looking up to see what notes followed . I never really listened to what I was playing . I daydreamed about being somewhere else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice best was the fancy curtsy : rightfoot out , touch the rose on the carpet with a pointed foot , sweep to the side , left leg bends , look up and smile . My parents invited all the couples from the Joy Luck Club towitness my debut . Auntie Lindo and Uncle Tin were there . Waverly and her two older brothers had also come . The first tworows were filled with children both younger and older than I was . The littlest ones got to go first . They recited simple nursery rhymes , squawked out tunes on miniature violins , twirled Hula Hoops , pranced in pink ballet tutus , and when they bowed or curtsied , the audience would sigh in unison , " Awww , " and then clap . enthusiastically . When my turn came , I was very confident . I remember my childish excitement . It was as if I knew , without a doubt , that the prodigy side of me really did exist . I had no fear whatsoever , no nervousness . I remember thinking to myself , This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the audience , at my mother 's blank face , my father 's yawn , Auntie Lindo 's stiff-lipped smile , Waverly 's sulky expression . I had on a white dress layered with sheets oflace , and a pink bow in my Peter Pan haircut . As I sat down I envisioned people jumping to their feet and Ed Sullivan rushing up to introduce me to everyone on TV . And I started to play . It was so beautiful . I was so caught up in how lovely I looked that at first I did n't worry how I wouldsound . So it was a surprise to me when I hit the first wrong note and I realized something did n't sound quite right . And then I hit another and another followed that . A chill started at the top of my head and began to trickle down . Yet I could n't stop playing , as though my hands were bewitched . I kept thinking my fingers would adjust themselves back , like a train switching to the right track . I played this strange jumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to the end.  |p140When  I stood up , I discovered my legs were shaking . Maybe I had just been nervous and the audience , like Old Chong , had seen me go through the right motions and had not heard anything wrong at all . I swept my right foot out , went down on my knee , looked up and smiled . The room was quiet , except for Old Chong , who was beaming and shouting , " Bravo ! Bravo ! Well done ! " But then I saw my mother 's face , her stricken face . The audience clapped weakly , and as I walked back to my chair , with my whole face quivering as I tried not to cry , I heard a little boy whisper loudly to his mother , " That was awful , " and the mother whispered back , " Well , she certainly tried . " And now I realized how many people were in the audience , the whole world it seemed . I was aware of eyes burning into my back . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat stiffly throughout the rest of the show . We could have escaped during intermission . Pride and some strange sense of honor must have anchored my parents to their chairs . And so we watched it all : the eighteen-year-old boy with a fake mustache who did a magic show and juggled flaming hoops while riding a unicycle . The breasted girl with white makeup who sang from Madama Butterfly and got honorable mention . And the eleven-year-old boy who won first prize playing a tricky violin song that sounded like a busy bee . After the show , the Hsus , the Jongs , and the St. Clairs from the Joy Luck Club came up to my mother and father . " Lots of talented kids , " Auntie Lindo said vaguely , smiling broadly . " That was somethin ' else , " said my father , and I wondered if he was referring to me in a humorous way , or whether he even remembered what I had done . Waverly looked at me and shrugged her shoulders . " You are n't a genius like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't felt so bad , I would have pulled her braids and punched her stomach . But my mother 's expression was what devastated me : a quiet , blank look that said she had lost everything . I felt the same way , and it seemed as if everybody were now coming up , like gawkersp141at the scene of an accident , to see what parts were actually missing . When we got on the bus to go home , my father was humming the busy-bee tune and my mother was silent . I kept thinking she wanted to wait until we got home before shouting at me . But when my father unlocked the door to our apartment , my mother walked in and then went to the back , into the bedroom . No accusations . No blame . And in a way , I felt disappointed . I had been waiting for her to start shouting , so I could shout back and cry and blame her for all my misery . I assumed my talent-show fiasco meant I never had to play the piano again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of the kitchen and saw me watching TV . " Four clock , " she reminded me as if it were any other day . I was stunned , as though she were asking me to go through the talent-show torture again . I wedged myself more tightly in front of the TV . " Turn off TV , " she called from the kitchen five minutes later . I did n't budge . And then I decided . I did n't have to do what my mother said anymore . I was n't her slave . This was n't China . I had listened to her before and look what happened . She was the stupid one . She came out from the kitchen and stood in the arched entrywayof the living room . " Four clock , " she said once again , louder . " I 'm not going to play anymore , " I said nonchalantly . " Why should I ? I 'm not a genius . " She walked over and stood in front of the TV . I saw her chest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! " I said , and I now felt stronger , as if my true self had finally emerged . So this was what had been inside me all along . " No ! I wo n't ! " I screamed . She yanked me by the arm , pulled me off the floor , snapped off the TV . She was frighteningly strong , half pulling , half car-. rying me toward the piano as I kicked the throw rugs under my feet . She lifted me up and onto the hard bench . I was sobbing by now , looking at her bitterly . Her chest was heaving evenp142more and her mouth was open , smiling crazily as if she were pleased I was crying . " You want me to he someone that I 'm not ! " I sobbed . " I 'll never he the kind of daughter you want me to be ! " " Only two kinds of daughters , " she shouted in Chinese . " Those who are obedient and those who follow their own mind ! Only one kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " "  --  Then I wish I was n't your daughter . I wish you were n't my mother , " I shouted . As I said these things I got scared . It felt like worms and toads and slimy things crawling out of my chest , but it also felt good , as if this awful side of me had surfaced , at last. " 1'oo late change this , " said my mother shrilly . And I could sense her anger rising to its breaking point . I wanted to see it spill over . And that 's when I remembered the babies she had lost in China , the ones we never talked about . ' Men I wish I 'd never been born ! " I shouted . " I wish I were dead ! Like them . " It was as if I had said the magic words . Alakazam !  --  and her face went blank , her mouth closed , her arms went slack , and she backed out of the room , stunned , as if she were blowing away like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not the only disappointment my mother felt in me . In the years that followed , I failed her so many times , each time asserting my own will , my right to fall short of expectations . I did n't get straight As . I did n't become class president . I did n't get into Stanford . I dropped out of college . For unlike my mother , I did not believe I could be anything I wanted to be . I could only be me . And for all those years , we never talked about the disaster at the recital or my terrible accusations afterward at the piano bench . All that remained unchecked , like a betrayal that was now unspeakable . So I never found a way to ask her why she had hoped for something so large that failure was inevitable.  |p143And  even worse , I never asked her what frightened me the most : Why had she given up hope ? For after our struggle at the piano , she never mentioned my playing again . The lessons stopped . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust , my misery , and her dreams . So she surprised me . A few years ago , she offered to give methe piano , for my thirtieth birthday . I had not played in all thoseyears . I saw the offer as a sign of forgiveness , a tremendous burden removed . " Are you sure ? " I asked shyly . " I mean , wo n't you and Dadmiss it ? " " No , this your piano , " she said firmly . " Always your piano . You only one can play . " " Well , I probably ca n't play anymore , " I said . " It 's been years . " " You pick up fast , " said my mother , as if she knew this wascertain . " You have natural talent . You could been genius if you want to . " " No I could n't . " " You just not trying , " said my mother . And she was neither angry nor sad . She said it as if to announce a fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But I did n't at first . It was enough that she had offered it to me . And after that , every time I saw it in my parents ' living room , standing in front of the bay windows , it made me feel proud , as if it were a shiny trophy I had won back . Last week I sent a tuner over to my parents ' apartment and had the piano reconditioned , for purely sentimental reasons . My mother had died a few months before and I had been getting things in order for my father , a little bit at a time . I put the jewelry in special silk pouches . The sweaters she had knittedin yellow , pink , bright orange  --  all the colors I hated  --  I put those in moth-proof boxes . I found some old Chinese silk dresses , the kind with little slits up the sides . I rubbed the old silk against my skin , then wrapped them in tissue and decided to take themhome with me.  |p144After  I had the piano tuned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded even richer than I remembered . Really , it was a very good piano . Inside the bench were the same exercise notes with handwritten scales , the same secondhand music books with their covers held together with yellow tape . I opened up the Schumann book to the dark little piece I had played at the recital . It was on the left-hand side of the page , " Pleading Child . " It looked more difficult than I remembered . I played a few bars , surprised at how easily the notes came back to me . And for the first time , or so it seemed , I noticed the piece on the right-hand side . It was called " Perfectly Contented . " I tried to play this one as well . It had a lighter melody but the same flowing rhythm and turned out to be quite easy . " PleadingChild " was shorter but slower ; " Perfectly Contented " was longer , but faster . And after I played them both a few times , I realized they were two halves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother has the mysterious ability to see things before they happen . She has a Chinese saying for what she knows . Chunwang chihan : If the lips are gone , the teeth will be cold . Which means , I suppose , one thing is always the result of another . But she does not predict when earthquakes will come , or how the stock market will do . She sees only bad things that affect our family . And she knows what causes them . But now she laments that she never did anything to stop them . One time when I was growing up in San Francisco , she looked at the way our new apartment sat too steeply on the hill . She said the new baby in her womb would fall out dead , and it did . When a plumbing and bathroom fixtures store opened up across the street from our bank , my mother said the bank would soon have all its money drained away . And one month later , an officer of the bank was arrested for embezzlement . And just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would happen . Because a philodendron plant my father had given her had withered and died , despite the fact that she watered it faithfully . She said the plant had damaged its roots and no water could get to it . The autopsy report she later received showed my father had had ninety-percent blockage of the arteriesp150before he died of a heart attack at the age of seventy-four . My father was not Chinese like my mother , but English-Irish American , who enjoyed his five slices of bacon and three eggs sunnysideup every morning . I remember this ability of my mother 's , because now she is visiting my husband and me in the house we just bought in Woodside . And I wonder what she will see . I larold and I were lucky to find this place , which is near the summit of Highway 9 , then a left-right-left down three forks of unmarked dirt roads , unmarked because the residents always tear down the signs to keep out salesmen , developers , and city inspectors . We are only a forty-minute drive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixty-minute ordeal coming back from San Francisco , when my mother was with us in the car . After we got to the two-lane winding road to the summit , she touched her hand gently to Harold 's shoulder and softly said , " Ai , tire squealing . " And then a little later , " Too much tear and wear on car . " Harold had smiled and slowed down , but I could see his hands were clenched on the steering wheel of the Jaguar , as he glanced nervously in his rearview mirror at the line of impatient cars that was growing by the minute . And I was secretly glad to watch his discomfort . He was always the one who tailgated old ladies in their Buicks , honking his horn and revving the engine as if he would run them over unless they pulled over . And at the same time , I hated myself for being mean-spirited , for thinking Harold deserved this torment . Yet T could n't help myself . I was mad at Harold and he was exasperated with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had said , " You should pay for the exterminators , because Mirugai is your cat and so they 're your fleas . It 's only fair . " None of our friends could ever believe we fight over something as stupid as fleas , but they would also never believe that our problems are much , much deeper than that , so deep I do n't even know where bottom is . And now that my mother is here  --  she is staying for a week ,  |p151or  until the electricians are done rewiring her building in San Francisco  --  we have to pretend nothing is the matter . Meanwhile she asks over and over again why we had to pay so much for a renovated barn and a mildew-lined pool on four acres of land , two of which arc covered with redwood trees and poison oak . Actually she does n't really ask , she just says , " Aii , so much money , so much , " as we show her different parts of the house and land . And her laments always compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you see , it 's the details that cost so much . Like this wood floor . It 's hand-bleached . And the walls here , this marbleized effect , it 's hand-sponged . It 's really worth it . " And my mother nods and agrees : " Bleach and sponge cost so much . " During our brief tour of the house , she 's already found the flaws . She says the slant of the floor makes her feel as if she is " running down . " She thinks the guest room where she will be staying  --  which is really a former hayloft shaped by a sloped roof  --  has " two Topsides . " She sees spiders in high corners and even fleas jumping up in the air  --  pah ! pah ! pah !  --  like little spatters of hot oil . My mothers knows , underneath all the fancy details that cost so much , this house is still a barn . She can see all this . And it annoys me that all she sees are the bad parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said is true . And this convinces me she can see what else is going on , between Harold and me . She knows what 's going to happen to us . Because I remember something else she saw when I was eight years old . My mother had looked in my rice bowl and told me I would marry a bad man . " Aii , Lena , " she had said after that dinner so many years ago , " your future husband have one pock mark for every rice you not finish . " She put my bowl down . " I once know a pock-mark man . Mean man , bad man . " And I thought of a mean neighbor boy who had tiny pits inp152his cheeks , and it was true , those marks were the size of rice grains . This boy was about twelve and his name was Arnold . Arnold would shoot rubber bands at my legs whenever I walked past his building on my way home from school , and one time he ran over my doll with his bicycle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want this cruel boy to be my future husband . So I picked up that cold bowl of rice and scraped the last few grains into my mouth , then smiled at my mother , confident my future husband would be not Arnold but someone whose face was as smooth as the porcelain in my now clean bowl . But my mother sighed . " Yesterday , you not finish rice either . " I thought of those unfinished mouthfuls of rice , and then the grains that lined my bowl the day before , and the day before that . By the minute , my eight-year-old heart grew more and more terror-stricken over the growing possibility that my future husband was fated to be this mean boy Arnold . And thanks to my poor eating habits , his hideous face would eventually resemblethe craters of the moon . This would have been a funny incident to remember from my childhood , but it is actually a memory I recall from time to time with a mixture of nausea and remorse . My loathing for Arnold had grown to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . I let one thing result from another . Of course , all of it could have been just loosely connected coincidences . And whether that 's true or not , I know the intention was there . Because when I want something to happen  --  or not happen  --  I begin to look at all events and all things as relevant , an opportunity to take or avoid . I found the opportunity . The same week my mother told me about the rice bowl and my future husband , I saw a shocking film at Sunday school . I remember the teacher had dimmed the lights so that all we could see were silhouettes of one another . Then the teacher looked at us , a roomful of squirmy , well-fed Chinese-American children , and she said , " This film will show you why you should give tithings to God , to do God 's work . " She said , " I want you to think about a nickel 's worth of candy money , or however much you eat each week  --  your Good andp153Plentys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to what you are about to see . And I also want you to think about what your true blessings in life really are . " And then she set the film projector clattering away . The film showed missionaries in Africa and India . These good souls worked with people whose legs were swollen to the size of tree trunks , whose numb limbs had become as twisted as jungle vines . But the most terrible of the afflictions were men and women with leprosy . Their faces were covered with every kind of misery I could imagine : pits and pustules , cracks and bumps , and fissures that I was sure erupted with the same vehemence as snails writhingin a bed of salt . If my mother had been in the room , she would have told me these poor people were victims of future husbands and wives who had failed to eat platefuls of food . After seeing this film , I did a terrible thing . I saw what I had to do so I would not have to marry Arnold . I began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended my prodigal ways beyond Chinese food . I did not finish my creamed corn , broccoli , Rice Krispies , or peanut butter sandwiches . And once , when I bit into a candy bar and saw how lumpy it was , how full of secret dark spots and creamy goo , I sacrificed that as well . I considered that probably nothing would happen to Arnold , that he might not get leprosy , move to Africa and die . And this somehow balanced the dark possibility that he might . He did n't die right away . In fact , it was some five years later , by which time I had become quite thin . I had stopped eating , not because of Arnold , whom I had long forgotten , but to be fashionably anorexic like all the other thirteen-year-old girls who were dieting and finding other ways to suffer as teenagers . I was sitting at the breakfast table , waiting for my mother to finish packing a sack lunch which I always promptly threw away as soon as I rounded the corner . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his bacon into the egg yolks with one hand , while holding the newspaper with the other . " Oh my , listen to this , " he said , still dabbing . And that 's when he announced that Arnold Reisman , a boy who lived in our old neighborhood in Oakland , had died of complications fromp154measles . He had just been accepted to Cal State Hayward and was planning to become a podiatrist . " Doctors were at first baffled by the disease , which they report is extremely rare and generally attacks children between the ages of ten and twenty , months to years after they have contracted the measles virus , ' " read my father . " The boy had had a mild case of the measles when he was twelve , reported his mother . Problems this year were first noticed when the boy developed motor coordination problems and mental lethargy which increased until he fell into a coma . The boy , age seventeen , never regained consciousness . ' " Did n't you know that boy ? " asked my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame , " said my mother , looking at me . " This is terrible shame . " And I thought she could see through me and that she knew I was the one who had caused Arnold to die . I was terrified . That night , in my room , I gorged myself . I had stolen a halfgallonof strawberry ice cream from the freezer , and I forced spoonful after spoonful down my throat . And later , for several hours after that , I sat hunched on the fire escape landing outside my bedroom , retching back into the ice cream container . And I remember wondering why it was that eating something good could make me feel so terrible , while vomiting something terriblecould make me feel so good . The thought that I could have caused Arnold 's death is not so ridiculous . Perhaps he was destined to be my husband . BecauseI think to myself , even today , how can the world in all its chaos come up with so many coincidences , so many similarities and exact opposites ? Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that he contracted measles the same year I began consciously to hate him ? And why did I think of Arnold in the first place  --  when my mother looked in my rice bowl  --  and then come to hate him so much ? Is n't hate merely the result of wounded love ? And even when I can finally dismiss all of this as ridiculous ,  |p155I  still feel that somehow , for the most part , we deserve what we get . I did n't get Arnold . I got Harold . Harold and I work at the same architectural firm , Livotny &; Associates . Only Harold Livotny is a partner and I am an asso-s ciate . We met eight years ago , before he started Livotny &; Associates . I was twenty-eight , a project assistant , and he was thirty-four . We both worked in the restaurant design and developmentdivision of Harned Kelley &; Davis . We started seeing each other for working lunches , to talk about the projects , and we would always split the tab right in half , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to gain weight easily . Later , when we started meeting secretly for dinner , we still divided the bill . And we just continued that way , everything right down the middle . If anything , I encouraged it . Sometimes I insisted onpaying for the whole thing : meal , drinks , and tip . And it really did n't bother me . " Lena , you 're really extraordinary , " Harold said after six months of dinners , five months of post-prandial lovemaking , and one week of timid and silly love confessions . We were lying in bed , between new purple sheets I had just bought for him . His old set of white sheets was stained in revealing places , not very romantic . And he nuzzled my neck and whispered , " I do n't think I 've ever met another woman , who 's so together ... "  --  and I rememberfeeling a hiccup of fear upon hearing the words " another woman , " because I could imagine dozens , hundreds of adoringwomen eager to buy Harold breakfast , lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their skin . Then he bit my neck and said in a rush , " Nor anyone who 's as soft and squishy and lovable as you are . " And with that , I swooned inside , caught off balance by this latest revelation of love , wondering how such a remarkable personas Harold could think I was extraordinary . Now that I 'm angry at Harold , it 's hard to remember what was so remarkable about him . And I know they 're there , thep156good qualities , because I was n't that stupid to fall in love with him , to marry him . All I can remember is how awfully lucky I felt , and consequently how worried I was that all this undeserved good fortune would someday slip away . When I fantasized about moving in with him , I also dredged up my deepest fears : that he would tell me I smelled bad , that I had terrible bathroom habits , that my taste in music and television was appalling . I worried that Harold would someday get a new prescription for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look me up and down , and say , " Why , gosh , you are n't the girl I thought you were , are you ? " And I think that feeling of fear never left me , that I would he caught someday , exposed as a sham of a woman . But recently , a friend of mine , Rose , who 's in therapy now because her marriagehas already fallen apart , told me those kinds of thoughts are commonplace in women like us . " At first I thought it was because I was raised with all this Chinese humility , " Rose said . " Or that maybe it was because when you 're Chinese you 're supposed to accept everything , flow with the Tao and not make waves . But my therapist said , Why do you blame your culture , your ethnicity ? And I remembered reading an article about baby boomers , how we expect the best and when we get it we worry that maybe we should have expectedmore , because it 's all diminishing returns after a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt better about myself and I thought , Of course , Harold and I are equals , in many respects . He 's not exactly handsome in the classic sense , although clearskinnedand certainly attractive in that wiry intellectual way . And I may not be a raving beauty , but a lot of women in my aerobics class tell me I 'm " exotic " in an unusual way , and they 're jealous that my breasts do n't sag , now that small breasts are in . Plus , one of my clients said I have incredible vitality and exuberance . So I think I deserve someone like Harold , and I mean in the good sense and not like bad karma . We 're equals . I 'm also smart . I have common sense . And I 'm intuitive , highly so . I was thep157one who told Harold he was good enough to start his own firm . When we were still working at Harned Kelley &; Davis , I said , " Harold , this firm knows just what a good deal it has with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg . If you started your own business today , you 'd walk away with more than half of the restaurant clients . " And he said , laughing , " Half ? Boy , that 's love . " And I shouted back , laughing with him , " More than half ! You 're that good . You 're the best there is in restaurant design and development . You know it and I know it , and so do a lot of restaurant developers . " That was the night he decided to " go for it , " as he put it , which is a phrase I have personally detested ever since a bank I used to work for adopted the slogan for its employee productivitycontest . But still , I said to Harold , " Harold , I want to help you go for it , too . I mean , you 're going to need money to start this busi-ness . " He would n't hear of taking any money from me , not as a favor , not as a loan , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a partnership . He said he valued our relationship too much . I le did n't want to contaminate it with money . He explained , " I would n't want a handout any more than you 'd want one . As longas we keep the money thing separate , we 'll always be sure of our love for each other . " I wanted to protest . I wanted to say , " No ! I 'm not really this way about money , the way we 've been doing it . I 'm really intogiving freely . I want . . . " But I did n't know where to begin . I wanted to ask him who , what woman , had hurt him this way , that made him so scared about accepting love in all its wonderfultoxins . But then I heard him saying what I 'd been waiting to hear for a long , long time . " Actually , you could help me out if you moved in with me. mean , that way I could use the five hundred dollars ' rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful idea , " I said immediately , knowing how embarrassed he was to have to ask me that way . I was so delir/iously happy that it did n't matter that the rent on my studio was really only four hundred thirty-five . Besides , Harold 's place was much nicer , a two-bedroom flat with a two-hundred-forty-degree view of the bay . It was worth the extra money , no matter whom I shared the place with . So within the year , Harold and I quit Harned Kelley &; Davis and he started Livotny &; Associates , and I went to work there as a project coordinator . And no , he did n't gek half the restaurant clients of Harned Kelley &; Davis . In fact , Harned Kelley &; Davis threatened to sue if he walked away with even one client over the next year . So I gave him pep talks in the evening when he was discouraged . I told him how he should do more avantgardethematic restaurant design , to differentiate himself'from the other firms . " Who needs another brass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who wants another pasta place in sleek Italian moderno ? How many places can you go to with police cars lurching out of the walls ? This town is chockablock with restaurants that are just clones of the same old themes . You can find a niche . Do something different every time . Get the Hong Kong investors who are willing to sink some bucks into American ingenuity . " He gave me his adoring smile , the one that said , " I love it when you 're so naive . " And I adored his looking at me like that . So I stammered out my love . " You . . . you . . . could do new theme eating places . . . a . . . a . . . Home on the Range ! All the home-cooked mom stuff , mom at the kitchen range with a gingham apron and mom waitresses leaning over telling you to finish your soup . " And maybe . . . maybe you could do a novel-menu restaurant . . . foods from fiction . . . sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ephron 's Heartburn . And something else with a magic theme , or jokes and gags , or ... " Harold actually listened to me . He took those ideas and he applied them in an educated , methodical way . He made it happen . But still , I remember , it was my idea . And today Livotny &; Associates is a growing firm of twelvep159full-time people , which specializes in thematic restaurant design , what I still like to call " theme eating . " Harold is the conceptman , the chief architect , the designer , the person who makes the final sales presentation to a new client . I work under the interior designer , because , as Harold explains , it would not seem fair to the other employees if he promoted me just because we are now married  --  that was five years ago , two years after he started Livotny &; Associates . And even though I am very good at what I do , I have never been formally trained in this area . When I was majoring in Asian-American studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , for a college production1 of Madama Butterfly . At Livotny &; Associates , I procure the theme elements . For one restaurant called The Fisherman 's Tale , one of my prized findings was a yellow varnished wood boat stenciled with the name " Overbored , " and I was the one who thought the menus should dangle from miniature fishing poles , and the napkins be printed with rulers that have inches translating into feet . For aLawrence of Arabia deli called Tray Sheik , I was the one who thought the place should have a bazaar effect , and I found thereplicas of cobras lying on fake Hollywood boulders . I love my work when I do n't think about it too much . And when I do think about it , how much I get paid , how hard I work , how fair Harold is to everybody except me , I get upset . So really , we 're equals , except that Harold makes about seven times more than what I make . He knows this , too , because hesigns my monthly check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lately , however , this business about being equals started tobother me . It 's been on my mind , only I did n't really know it . I just felt a little uneasy about something . And then about a weekago , it all became clear . I was putting the breakfast dishes away and Harold was warming up the car so we could go to work . And I saw the newspaper spread open on the kitchen counter , Harold'sglasses on top , his favorite coffee mug with the chipped handle off to the side . And for some reason , seeing all theselittle domestic signs of familiarity , our daily ritual , made mep160swoon inside . But it was as if I were seeing Harold the first time we made love , this feeling of surrendering everything to him , with abandon , without caring what I got in return . And when I got into the car , I still had the glow of that feeling and I touched his hand and said , " Harold , I love you . " And he looked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I love you , too . Did you lock the door ? " And just like that , I started to think , It 's just not enough . Harold jingles the car keys and says , " I 'm going down the hill to buy stuff for dinner . Steaks okay ? Want anything special ? " " We 're out of rice , " I say , discreetly nodding toward my mother , whose back is turned to me . She 's looking out the kitchen window , at the trellis of bougainvillea . And then Harold is out the door and I hear the deep rumble of the car and then the sound of crunching gravel as he drives away . My mother and I are alone in the house . I start to water the plants . She is standing on her tiptoes , peering at a list stuck on our refrigerator door . The list says " Lena " and " Harold " and under each of our names are things we 've bought and how much they cost : Lena HAROLDchicken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bathroom stuff $5.41beer $19.63 Car stuff $6.57Maria ( clean + tip ) $65 Light Fixtures $87.26groceries Road gravel $19.99 ( see shop list ) $55.15 Gas $22.00petunias , potting soil Car Smog Check $35$14.11 Movies &; Dinner $65Photo developing Ice Cream $4.50 $13.83The way things are going this week , Harold 's already spent over a hundred dollars more , so I 'll owe him around fifty from my checking account . " What is this writing ? " asks my mother in Chinese.  | " Oh , nothing really . Just things we share , " I say as casually as I can . And she looks at me and frowns but does n't say anything . She goes hack to reading the list , this time more carefully , moving her finger down each item . And I feel embarrassed , knowing what she 's seeing . I 'm relievedthat she does n't see the other half of it , the discussions . Through countless talks , Harold and I reached an understanding about not including personal things like " mascara , " and " shaving lotion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tampons , " or " athlete 's foot powder . " When we got married at city hall , he insisted on paying the fee . I got my friend Robert to take photos . We held a party at our apartment and everybody brought champagne . And when eve bought the house , we agreed that I should pay only a perentageof the mortgage based on what I earn and what he earns , and that I should own an equivalent percentage of community property ; this is written in our prenuptial agreement . Since Haroldpays more , he had the deciding vote on how the house should look . It is sleek , spare , and what he calls " fluid , " nothing to disrupt the line , meaning none of my cluttered look . As for vacations , the one we choose together is fifty-fifty . The others Harold pays for , with the understanding that it 's a birthday or Christmas present , or an anniversary gift . And we 've had philosophical arguments over things that have gray borders , like my birth control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are really his clients or my old friends from college , or food magazines that I subscribe to but he also reads only because he 's bored , not because he would have chosen them for himself . And we still argue about Mirugai , the cat  --  not our cat , or my cat , but the cat that was his gift to me for my birthday last near . " ' Phis , you do not share ! " exclaims my mother in an astonished voice . And I am startled , thinking she had read my thoughts About Mirugai . But then I see she is pointing to " ice cream " on Harold 's list . My mother must remember the incident on thep162fire escape landing , where she found me , shivering and exhausted , sitting next to that container of regurgitated ice cream . I could never stand the stuff after that . And then I am startled once again to realize that Harold has never noticed that I do n't eat any of the ice cream he brings home every Friday evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wounded sound in her voice , as if I had put the list up to hurt her . I think how to explain this , recalling the words Harold and I have used with each other in the past : " So we can eliminate false dependencies . . . be equals . . . love without obligation . . . " But these are words she could never understand . So instead I tell my mother this : " I do n't really know . It 's something we started before we got married . And for some reason we never stopped . " When Harold returns from the store , he starts the charcoal . I unload the groceries , marinate the steaks , cook the rice , and set the table . My mother sits on a stool at the granite counter , drinking from a mug of coffee I 've poured for her . Every few minutes she wipes the bottom of the mug with a tissue she keeps stuffed in her sweater sleeve . During dinner , Harold keeps the conversation going . He talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding the deck , planting flower beds of tulips and crocuses , clearing the poison oak , adding another wing , building a Japanese-style tile bathroom . And then he clears the table and starts stacking the plates in the dishwasher . " Who 's ready for dessert ? " he asks , reaching into the freezer . " I 'm full , " I say . " Lena can not eat ice cream , " says my mother . " So it seems . She 's always on a diet . " " No , she never eat it . She does n't like . " And now Harold smiles and looks at me puzzled , expecting me to translate what my mother has said . " It 's true , " I say evenly . " I 've hated ice cream almost all my life . "  |p163Harold  looks at me , as if I , too , were speaking Chinese and he could not understand . " I guess I assumed you were just trying to lose weight . . . . Oh well . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says my mother . " She like a ghost , disappear . " " That 's right ! Christ , that 's great , " exclaims Harold , laughing , relieved in thinking my mother is graciously trying to rescue him . After dinner , I put clean towels on the bed in the guest room . My mother is sitting on the bed . The room has Harold 's minimalistlook to it : the twin bed with plain white sheets and white blanket , polished wood floors , ' a bleached oakwood chair , and nothing on the slanted gray walls . The only decoration is an odd-looking piece right next to the bed : an end table made out of a slab of unevenly cut marble and thin crisscrosses of black lacquer wood for the legs . My mother puts her handbag on the table and the cylindrical black vase on top starts to wobble . The freesias in the vase quiver . " Careful , it 's not too sturdy , " I say . The table is a poorly designed piece that Harold made in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so proud of it . The lines are clumsy . It does n't bear any of the traits of " fluidity " that are so important to Harold these days . " What use for ? " asks my mother , jiggling the table with her hand . " You put something else on top , everything fall down . Chunwang chihan . " I leave my mother in her room and go back downstairs . Harold is opening the windows to let the night air in . He does this every evening . " I 'm cold , " I say . " What 's that ? " " Could you close the windows , please . " He looks at me , sighs and smiles , pulls the windows shut , and then sits down cross-legged on the floor and flips open a magazine . I 'm sitting on the sofa , seething , and I do n't knowp164why . It 's not that Harold has - done anything wrong . Harold is just Harold . And before I even do it , I know I 'm starting a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do it anyway . I go to the refrigerator and I cross out " ice cream " on Harold 's side of the list . " What 's going on here ? " " I just do n't think you should get credit for your ice cream anymore . " He shrugs his shoulders , amused . " Suits me . " " Why do you have to be so goddamn fair ! " I shout . Harold puts his magazine down , now wearing his openmouthedexasperated look . " What is this ? Why do n't you saywhat 's really the matter ? " " I do n't know . . . . I do n't know . Everything . . . the way we account for everything . What we share . What we do n't share . I 'm so tired of it , adding things up , subtracting , making it come out even . I 'm sick of it . " " You were the one who wanted the cat . " " What are you talking about ? " " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll both pay for it . " " That 's not the point ! " " Then tell me , please , what is the point ? " I start to cry , which I know Harold hates . It always makes him uncomfortable , angry . He thinks it 's manipulative . But I ca n't help it , because I realize now that I do n't know what the point of this argument is . Am I asking Harold to support me ? Am I asking to pay less than half ? Do I really think we should stop accounting for everything ? Would n't we continue to tally things up in our head ? Would n't Harold wind up paying more ? And then would n't I feel worse , less than equal ? Or maybe we should n't have gotten married in the first place . Maybe Harold is a bad man . Maybe I 've made him this way . None of it seems right . Nothing makes sense . I can admit to nothing and I am in complete despair . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say when I thinkp165I can control my voice . Only the rest comes out like whining . " We need to think about what our marriage is really based on . . . not this balance sheet , who owes who what . " " Shit , " Harold says . And then he sighs and leans back , as if he were thinking about this . Finally he says in what sounds like a hurt voice , " Well , I know our marriage is based on a lot more than a balance sheet . A lot more . And if you do n't then I think you should think about what else you want , before you change things . " And now I do n't know what to think . What am I saying ? What 's he saying ? We sit in the room , not saying anything . The air feels muggy . I look out the window , and out in the distance is the valley beneath us , a sprinkling of thousands of lights shimmering in the summer fog . And then I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair scrapes across a wood floor . Harold starts to get up , but I say , " No , I 'll go see . " The door is open , but the room is dark , so I call out , " Ma ? " I see it right away : the marble end table collapsed on top of its spindly black legs . Off to the side is the black vase , the smooth cylinder broken in half , the freesias strewn in a puddle of water . And then I see my mother sitting by the open window , her dark silhouette against the night sky . She turns around in her chair , but I ca n't see her face . " Fallen down , " she says simply . She does n't apologize . " It does n't matter , " I say , and I start to pick up the broken glass shards . " I knew it would happen . " " Then why you do n't stop it ? " asks my mother . And it 's such a simple question.  |p166Four  DirectionsI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese restaurant in hopes of putting her in a good mood , but it was a disaster . When we met at the Four Directions Restaurant , she eyed me with immediate disapproval . " Ai-ya ! What 's the matter with your hair ? " she said in Chinese . " What do you mean , What 's the matter , ' " I said . " I had it cut . " Mr. Rory had styled my hair differently this time , an asymmetrical blunt-line fringe that was shorter on the left side . It was fashionable , yet not radically so . " Looks chopped off , " she said . " You must ask for your money back . " I sighed . " Let 's just have a nice lunch together , okay ? " She wore her tight-lipped , pinched-nose look as she scanned the menu , muttering , " Not too many good things , this menu . " Then she tapped the waiter 's arm , wiped the length of her chopsticks with her finger , and sniffed : " This greasy thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She made a show of washing out her rice bowl with hot tea , and then warned other restaurant patrons seated near us to do the same . She told the waiter to make sure the soup was very hot , and of course , it was by her tongue 's expert estimate " not even lukewarm . "  | " You should n't get so upset , " I said to my mother after she disputed a charge of two extra dollars because she had specified chrysanthemum tea , instead of the regular green tea . " Besides , unnecessary stress is n't good for your heart . " " Nothing is wrong with my heart , " she huffed as she kept a disparaging eye on the waiter . And she was right . Despite all the tension she places on herself  --  andothers  --  the doctors have proclaimed that my mother , at age sixty-nine , has the blood pressure of a sixteen-year-old and the strength of a horse . And that 's what she is . A Horse , born in 1918 , destined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I make a bad combination , because I 'm a Rabbit , born in 1951 , supposedly sensitive , with tendencies towardbeing thin-skinned and skittery at the first sign of criticism . After our miserable lunch , I gave up the idea that there would ever be a good time to tell her the news : that Rich Schields and I were getting married . " Why are you so nervous ? " my friend Marlene Ferber had asked over the phone the other night . " It 's not as if Rich is the scum of the earth . He 's a tax attorney like you , for Chrissake . I low can she criticize that ? " " You do n't know my mother , " I said . " She never thinks anybody is good enough for anything . " " So elope with the guy , " said Marlene . " That 's what I did with Marvin . " Marvin was my first hushand , my high school sweetheart . " So there you go , " said Marlene . " So when my mother found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " And that was just for openers . " My mother had never met Rich . In fact , every time I brought up his name  --  when I said , for instance , that Rich and I had gone to the symphony , that Rich had taken my four-year-old daughter , Shoshana , to the zoo  --  my mother found a way to change the subject . " Did I tell you , " I said as we waited for the lunch bill at Fourp168Directions , " what a great time Shoshana had with Rich at the Exploratorium ? Ile  --  " " Oh , " interrupted my mother , " I did n't tell you . Your father , doctors say maybe need exploratory surgery . But no , now they say everything normal , just too much constipated . " I gave up . And then we did the usual routine . I paid for the bill , with a ten and three ones . My mother pulled back the dollar bills and counted out exact change , thirteencents , and put that on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She tossed her head back with a triumphant smile . And while my mother used the restroom , I slipped the waiter a five-dollar bill . He nodded to me with deep understanding . While she was gone , I devised another plan . " Chosdle ! "  --  Stinks to death in there !  --  muttered my mother when she returned . She nudged me with a little travel package of Kleenex . She did not trust other people 's toilet paper . " Do you need to use ? " I shook my head . " But before I drop you off , let 's stop at my place real quick . There 's something I want to show you . " My mother had not been to my apartment in months . When I was first married , she used to drop by unannounced , until one day I suggested she should call ahead of time . Ever since then , she has refused to come unless I issue an official invitation . And so I watched her , seeing her reaction to the changes in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce , when all of a sudden I had too much time to keep my life in order  --  to this present chaos , a home full of life and love . The hallway floor was littered with Shoshana 's toys , all bright plastic things with scattered parts . There was a set of Rich 's barbells in the living room , two dirty snifters on the coffee table , the disemboweled remains of a phone that Shoshana and Rich took apart the other day to see where the voices came from . " It 's back here , " I said . We kept walking , all the way to the back bedroom . The bed was unmade , dresser drawers were hanging out with socks and ties spilling over . My mother stepped over running shoes , more of Shoshana 's toys , Rich 's black loaf/ers , my scarves , a stack of white shirts just back from the cleaner 's . Her look was one of painful denial , reminding me of a time long ago when she took my brothers and me down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle went into my brother 's arm and he screamed , my mother looked at me with agony written all over her face and assured me , " Next one does n't hurt . But now , how could my mother not notice that we were living together , that this was serious and would not go away even if she did n't talk about it ? She had to say something . I went to the closet and then came back with a mink jacket that Rich had given me for Christmas . It was the most extravagantgift I had ever received . I put the jacket on . " It 's sort of a silly present , " I said nervously . " It 's hardly ever cold enough in San Francisco to wear mink . But it seems to be a fad , what people are buying their wives and girlfriends these days . " My mother was quiet . She was looking toward my open closet , bulging with racks of shoes , ties , my dresses , and Rich 's suits . She ran her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said at last . " It is just leftover strips . And the fur is too short , no long hairs . " " How can you criticize a gift ! " I protested . I was deeply wounded . " He gave me this from his heart . " " That is why I worry , " she said . And looking at the coat in the mirror , I could n't fend off the strength of her will anymore , her ability to make me see black where there was once white , white where there was once black . The coat looked shabby , an imitation of romance . " Are n't you going to say anything else ? " I asked softly . " What I should say ? " " About the apartment ? About this ? " I gestured to all the signs of Rich lying about . She looked around the room , toward the hall , and finally she said , " You have career . You are busy . You want to live like mess , what I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve . And the pain I feel is worse than any other kind of misery . Because what she does always comes as a shock , exactly like an electric jolt , that grounds itself permanently in my memory . I still remember the first time I felt it . I was ten years old . Even though I was young , I knew my ability to play chess was a gift . It was effortless , so easy . I could see things on the chessboard that other people could not . I could create harriers to protect myself that were invisible to my opponents . And this gift gave me supreme confidence . I knew what my opponents would do , move for move . I knew at exactly what point their faces would fall when my seemingly simple and childlike strategy would reveal itself as a devastating and irrevocablecourse . I loved to win . And my mother loved to show me off , like one of my many trophies she polished . She used to discuss my games as if she had devised the strategies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the enemy , " she informed one shopkeeper . " She won very quickly this way . " And of course , she had said this before the game  --  that and a hundred other useless things that had nothing to do with my winning . To our family friends who visited she would confide , " You do n't have to be so smart to win chess . It is just tricks . You blow from the North , South , East , and West . The other person becomesconfused . They do n't know which way to run . " I hated the way she tried to take all the credit . And one day I told her so , shouting at her on Stockton Street , in the middle of a crowd of people . I told her she did n't know anything , so she should n't show off . She should shut up . Words to that effect . That evening and the next day she would n't speak to me . She would say stiff words to my father and brothers , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten fish she had thrown away but which had left behind its bad smell.  |p171I  knew this strategy , the sneaky way to get someone to pounce back in anger and fall into a trap . So I ignored her . I refused to speak and waited for her to come to me . After many days had gone by in silence , I sat in my room , staring at the sixty-four squares of my chessboard , trying to think of another way . And that 's when I decided to quit playing chess . Of course I did n't mean to quit forever . At most , just for a few days . And I made a show of it . Instead of practicing in my room every night , as I always did , I marched into the living room and sat down in front of the television set with my brothers , who stared at me , an unwelcome intruder . I used my brothers to further my plan ; I cracked my knuckles to annoy them . " Ma ! " they shouted . " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother did not say anything . Still I was not worried . But I could see I would have to make a stronger move . I decided to sacrifice a tournament that was coming up in one week . I would refuse to play in it . And my mother would certainly have to speak to me about this . Because the sponsors and the benevolent associations would start calling her , asking , shouting , pleading to make me play again . And then the tournament came and went . And she did not come to me , crying , " Why are you not playing chess ? " But I was crying inside , because I learned that a boy whom I had easily defeated on two other occasions had won . I realized my mother knew more tricks than I had thought . But now I was tired.of her game . I wanted to start practicing for the next tournament . So I decided to pretend to let her win . I would be the one to speak first . " I am ready to play chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined she would smile and then ask me what special thing I wanted to eat . But instead , she gathered her face into a frown and stared into my eyes , as if she could force some kind of truth out of me . " Why do you tell me this ? " she finally said in sharp tones . " You think it is so easy . One day quit , next day play . Everything for you is this way . So smart , so easy , so fast . " " I said I 'll play , " I whined.  | " No ! " she shouted , and I almost jumped out of my scalp . " It is not so easy anymore . " I was quivering , stunned by what she said , in not knowing what she meant . And then I went back to my room . I stared at my chessboard , its sixty-four squares , to figure out how to undo this terrible mess . And after staring like this for many hours , I actually believed that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everything would be all right . And sure enough , I won her back . That night I developed a high fever , and she sat next to my bed , scolding me for going to school without my sweater . In the morning she was there as well , feeding me rice porridge flavored with chicken broth she had strained herself . She said she was feeding me this because I had the chicken pox and one chicken knew how to fight another . And in the afternoon , she sat in a chair in my room , knitting me a pink sweater while telling me about a sweater that Auntie Suyuan had knit for her daughter June , and how it was most unattractive and of the worst yarn . I was so happy that she had become her usual self . But after I got well , I discovered that , really , my mother had changed . She no longer hovered over me as I practiced different chess games . She did not polish my trophies every day . She did not cut out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she had erected an invisible wall and I was secretly groping each day to see how high and how wide it was . At my next tournament , while I had done well overall , in the end the points were not enough . I lost . And what was worse , my mother said nothing . She seemed to walk around with this satisfied look , as if it had happened because she had devised this strategy . I was horrified . I spent many hours every day going over in my mind what I had lost . I knew it was not just the last tournament . I examined every move , every piece , every square . And I could no longer see the secret weapons of each piece , the magic within the intersection of each square . I could see only my mistakes , my weaknesses . It was as though I had lost my magic armor . And everybody could see this , where it was easy to attack me.  |p173Over  the next few weeks and later months and years , I continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence . I fought hard , with fear and desperation . When I won , I was grateful , relieved . And when I lost , I was filled with growing dread , and then terror that I was no longer a prodigy , that I had lost the gift and had turned into someone quite ordinary . When I lost twice to the boy whom I had defeated so easily a few years before , I stopped playing chess altogether . And nobody protested . I was fourteen . " You know , I really do n't understand you , " said Marlene when I called her the night after I had shown my mother the mink jacket . " You can tell the IRS to piss u'p a rope , but you ca n't stand up to your own mother . " " I always intend to and then she says these little sneaky things , smoke bombs and little barbs , and ... " " Why do n't you tell her to stop torturing you , " said Marlene . " Tell her to stop ruining your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hilarious , " I said with a half-laugh . " You want me to tell my mother to shut up ? " " Sure , why not ? " " Well , I do n't know if it 's explicitly stated in the law , but you ca n't ever tell a Chinese mother to shut up . You could be charged as an accessory to your own murder . " I was n't so much afraid of my mother as I was afraid for Rich . I already knew what she would do , how she would attack him , how she would criticize him . She would be quiet at first . Then she would say a word about something small , something she had noticed , and then another word , and another , each one flung out like a little piece of sand , one from this direction , another from behind , more and more , until his looks , his character , his soul would have eroded away . And even if I recognized her strategy , her sneak attack , I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , blur what I was seeing and transform him from the divine man I thought he was into some/one quite mundane , mortally wounded with tiresome habits and irritating imperfections . This happened to my first marriage , to Marvin Chen , with whom I had eloped when I was eighteen and he was nineteen . When I was in love with Marvin , he was nearly perfect . He graduated third in his class at Lowell and got a full scholarship to Stanford . He played tennis . He had bulging calf muscles and one hundred forty-six straight black hairs on his chest . He made everyone laugh and his own laugh was deep , sonorous , masculinelysexy . He prided himself on having favorite love positions for different days and hours of the week ; all he had to whisper was " Wednesday afternoon " and I 'd shiver . But by the time my mother had had her say about him , I saw his brain had shrunk from laziness , so that now it was good only for thinking up excuses . He chased golf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye wandered up and down other girls ' legs , so he did n't know how to drive straight home anymore . He liked to tell big jokes to make other people feel little . He made a loud show of leaving ten-dollar tips to strangers but was stingy with presents to family . He thought waxing his red sports car all afternoon was more important than taking his wife somewhere in it . My feelings for Marvin never reached the level of hate . No , it was worse in a way . It went from disappointment to contempt to apathetic boredom . It was n't until after we separated , on nights when Shoshana was asleep and I was lonely , that I wondered if perhaps my mother had poisoned my marriage . Thank God , her poison did n't affect my daughter , Shoshana . I almost aborted her , though . When I found out I was pregnant , I was furious . I secretly referred to my pregnancy as my " growing resentment , " and I dragged Marvin down to the clinic so he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the wrong kind of clinic . They made us watch a film , a terrible bit of puritanical brainwash . I saw those little things , babies they called them even at seven weeks , and they had tiny , tiny fingers . And the film said that the baby 's translucent fingers could move ,  |p175chance  , this miracle of life . If they had shown anything else excepttiny fingers  --  so thank God they did . Because Shoshana really was a miracle . She was perfect . I found every detail about her to be remarkable , especially the way she flexed and curled her fingers . From the very moment she flung her fist away from her mouth to cry , I knew my feelings for her were inviolable . But I worried for Rich . Because I knew my feelings for him were vulnerable to being felled by my mother 's suspicions , passingremarks , and innuendos . And I was afraid of what I would then lose , because Rich Schields adored me in the same way I adored Shoshana . His love was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me ; my mere existence was enough . And at the same time , he said that he had changed  --  for the better  --  because of me . He was embarrassingly romantic ; he insistedhe never was until he met me . And this confession made his romantic gestures all the more ennobling . At work , for example , when he would staple " FYI  --  For Your Information " notes to legal briefs and corporate returns that I had to review , he signed them at the bottom : " FYI  --  Forever You &; I. " The firm did n't know about our relationship , and so that kind of reckless behavior on his part thrilled me . The sexual chemistry was what really surprised me , though . I thought he 'd be one of those quiet types who was awkwardly gentle and clumsy , the kind of mild-mannered guy who says , " Am I hurting you ? " when I ca n't feel a thing . But he was so attuned to my every movement I was sure he was reading my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered I had he 'd pry away from me like little treasures . He saw all those private aspects of me  --  and I mean not just sexual private parts , but my darker side , my meanness , my pettiness , my selfloathing  --  allthe things I kept hidden . So that with him I was completely naked , and when I was , when I was feeling the most vulnerable  --  when the wrong word would have sent me flying out the door forever  --  he always said exactly the right thing at the right moment . He did n't allow me to cover myself up . He would grab my hands , look me straight in the eye and tell me something new about why he loved me.  |p176I  'd never known love so pure , and I was afraid that it would become sullied by my mother . So I tried to store every one of these endearments about Rich in my memory , and I planned to call upon them again when the time was necessary . After much thought , I came up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother and win her over . In fact , I arranged it so my mother would want to cook a meal especially for him . I had some help from Auntie Suyuan . Auntie Su was my mother 's friend from way back . They were very close , which meant they were ceaselessly tormenting each other with boasts and secrets . And I gave Auntie Su a secret to boast about . After walking through North Beach one Sunday , I suggested to Rich that we stop by for a surprise visit to my Auntie Su and Uncle Canning . They lived on Leavenworth , just a few blocks west of my mother 's apartment . It was late afternoon , just in time to catch Auntie Su preparing Sunday dinner . " Stay ! Stay ! " she had insisted . " No , no . It 's just that we were walking by , " I said . " Already cooked enough for you . See ? One soup , four dishes . You do n't eat it , only have to throw it away . Wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Auntie Suyuan had a thank-you letter from Rich and me . " Rich said it was the best Chinese food he has ever tasted , " I wrote . And the next day , my mother called me , to invite me to a belated birthday dinner for my father . My brother Vincent was bringing his girlfriend , Lisa Lum . I could bring a friend , too . I knew she would do this , because cooking was how my mother expressed her love , her pride , her power , her proof that she knew more than Auntie Su . " Just be sure to tell her later that her cooking was the best you ever tasted , that it was far better than Auntie Su 's , " I told Rich . " Believe me . " The night of the dinner , I sat in the kitchen watching her cook , waiting for the right moment to tell her about our marriage plans , that we had decided to get married next July , about seven months away . She was chopping eggplant into wedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She can only cook looking at a recipe . My instructions are in my fingers . I know what secret ingredients to put in just by using my nose ! " And she was slicing with such a ferocity , seemingly inattentive to her sharp cleaver , that I was afraid her fingertips would become one of the ingredients of the red-cooked eggplant and shredded pork dish . I was hoping she would say something first about Rich . I had seen her expression when she opened the door , her forced smile as she scrutinized him from head to toe , checking her appraisal of him against that already given to her by Auntie Suyuan . I tried to anticipate what criticisms she would have . Rich was not only not Chinese , he was a few years younger than I was . And unfortunately , he looked much younger with his curly red hair , smooth pale skin , and the splash of orange freckles across his nose . He was a bit on the short side , compactly built . In his dark business suits , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a funeral . Which was why I did n't notice him the first year we worked together at the firm . But my mother noticed everything . " So what do you think of Rich ? " I finally asked , holding my breath . She tossed the eggplant in the hot oil and it made a loud , angry hissing sound . " So many spots on his face , " she said . I could feel the pinpricks on my back . " They 're freckles . Freckles are good luck , you know , " I said a bit too heatedly in trying to raise my voice above the din of the kitchen . " Oh ? " she said innocently . " Yes , the more spots the better . Everybody knows that . " She considered this a moment and then smiled and spoke in Chinese : " Maybe this is true . When you were young , you got the chicken pox . So many spots , you had to stay home for ten days . So lucky , you thought . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't save him later at the dinner table . He had brought a bottle of French wine , something he did not know my parents could not appreciate . My parents did notp178even own wineglasses . And then he also made the mistake of drinking not one but two frosted glasses full , while everybody else had a half-inch " just for taste . " When I offered Rich a fork , he insisted on using the slippery ivory chopsticks . He held them splayed like the knock-kneed legs of an ostrich while picking up a large chunk of sauce-coated eggplant . Halfway between his plate and his open mouth , the chunk fell on his crisp white shirt and then slid into his crotch . It took several minutes to get Shoshana to stop shrieking with laughter. , And then he had helped himself to big portions of the shrimp and snow peas , not realizing he should have taken only a polite spoonful , until everybody had had a morsel . He had declined the sauteed new greens , the tender and expensive leaves of bean plants plucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat them also , pointing to Rich : " He did n't eat them ! He did n't eat them ! " He thought he was being polite by refusing seconds , when he should have followed my father 's example , who made a big show of taking small portions of seconds , thirds , and even fourths , always saying he could not resist another bite of something or other , and then groaning that he was so full he thought he would burst . But the worst was when Rich criticized my mother 's cooking , and he did n't even know what he had done . As is the Chinese cook 's custom , my mother always made disparaging remarks about her own cooking . That night she chose to direct it toward her famous steamed pork and preserved vegetable dish , which she always served with special pride . " Ai ! This dish not salty enough , no flavor , " she complained , after tasting a small bite . " It is too bad to eat . " This was our family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever made . But before we could do so , Rich said , " You know , all it needs is a little soy sauce . " And he proceeded to pour a riverful of the salty black stuff on the platter , right before my mother 's horrified eyes . And even though I was hoping throughout the dinner that myp179mother would somehow see Rich 's kindness , his sense of humor and boyish charm , I knew he had failed miserably in her eyes . Rich obviously had had a different opinion on how the evening had gone . When we got home that night , after we put Shoshana to bed , he said modestly , " Well . I think we hit it off A-o-kay . " He had the look of a dalmatian , panting , loyal , waiting to be petted . " Uh-hmm , " I said . I was putting on an old nightgown , a hint that I was not feeling amorous . I was still shuddering , rememberinghow Rich had firmly shaken both my parents ' hands with that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda , Tim , " he said , " we 'll see you again soon , I 'm sure . " My parents ' names are Lindo and Tin Jong , and nobody , except a few older family friends , ever calls them by their first names . " So what did she say when you told her ? " And I knew he was referring to our getting married . I had told Rich earlier that I would tell my mother first and let her break the news to my father . " I never had a chance , " I said , which was true . How could I have told my mother I was getting married , when at every possiblemoment we were alone , she seemed to remark on how much expensive wine Rich liked to drink , or how pale and ill he looked , or how sad Shoshana seemed to be . Rich was smiling . " How long does it take to say , Mom , Dad , I 'm getting married ? " " You do n't understand . You do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whew ! You can say that again . Her English was so bad . You know , when she was talking about that dead guy showing up on Dynasty , I thought she was talking about something that happened in China a long time ago . " That night , after the dinner , I lay in bed , tense . I was despairing over this latest failure , made worse by the fact that Rich seemed blind to it all . He looked so pathetic . So pathetic , those words ! My mother was doing it again , making me see black where Ip180once saw white . In her hands , I always became the pawn . I could only run away . And she was the queen , able to move in all directions , relentless in her pursuit , always able to find my weakestspots . I woke up late , with teeth clenched and every nerve on edge . Rich was already up , showered , and reading the Sunday paper . " Morning , doll , " he said between noisy munches of cornflakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , got into the car , and drove to my parents ' apartment . Marlene was right . I had to tell my mother  --  that I knew what she was doing , her scheming ways of making me miserable . By the time I arrived , I had enough anger to fend off a thousand flying cleavers . My father opened the door and looked surprised to see me . " Where 's Ma ? " I asked , trying to keep my breath even . He gestured to the living room in back . I found her sleeping soundly on the sofa . The back of her head was resting on a white embroidered doily . Her mouth was slack and all the lines in her face were gone . With her smooth face , she looked like a young girl , frail , guileless , and innocent . One arm hung limply down the side of the sofa . Her chest was still . All her strength was gone . She had no weapons , no demons surrounding her . She looked powerless . Defeated . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this because she was dead . She had died when I was having terrible thoughts about her . I had wished her out of my life , and she had acquiesced , floating out of her body to escape my terrible hatred . " Ma ! " I said sharply . " Ma ! " I whined , starting to cry . And her eyes slowly opened . She blinked . Her hands moved with life . " Shemma ? Meimei-ah ? Is that you ? " I was speechless . She had not called me Meimei , my childhood name , in many years . She sat up and the lines in her face returned , only now they seemed less harsh , soft creases of worry . " Why are you here ? Why are you crying ? Something has hap-pened ! " I did n't know what to do or say . In a matter of seconds , itp181seemed , I had gone from being angered by her strength , to being amazed by her innocence , and then frightened by her vulnerability . And now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unplugged me and the current running through me had stopped . " Nothing 's happened . Nothing 's the matter . I do n't know why I 'm here , " I said in a hoarse voice . " I wanted to talk to you . . . . I wanted to tell you . . . Rich and I are getting married . " I squeezed my eyes shut , waiting to hear her protests , her laments , the dry voice delivering some sort of painful verdict . Jrdaule "  --  I already know this  --  she said , as if to ask why I was telling her this again . " You know ? " " Of course . Even if you did n't tell me , " she said simply . This was worse than I had imagined . She had known all along , when she criticized the mink jacket , when she belittled his freckles and complained about his drinking habits . She disapproved of him . " I know you hate him , " I said in a quavering voice . " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hate ? Why do you think I hate your future husband ? " " You never want to talk about him . The other day , when I started to tell you about him and Shoshana at the Exploratorium , you . . . you changed the subject . . . you started talking about Dad 's exploratory surgery and then ... " " What is more important , explore fun or explore sickness ? " I was n't going to let her escape this time . " And then when you met him , you said he had spots on his face . " She looked at me , puzzled . " Is this not true ? " " Yes , but , you said it just to be mean , to hurt me , to ... " " Ai-ya , why do you think these bad things about me ? " Her face looked old and full of sorrow . " So you think your mother is this bad . You think I have a secret meaning . But it is you who has this meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat straight and proud on the sofa , her mouth clamped tight , her hands clasped together , her eyes sparkling with angry tears . Oh , her strength ! her weakness !  --  both pulling me apart . My mind was flying one way , my heart another . I sat down on the sofa next to her , the two of us stricken by the other.  |p182I  felt as if I had lost a battle , but one that I did n't know I had been fighting . I was weary . " I 'm going home , " I finally said . " I 'm not feeling too good right now . " " You have become ill ? " she murmured , putting her hand on my forehead . " No , " I said . I wanted to leave . " I ... I just do n't know what 's inside me right now . " " Then I will tell you , " she said simply . And I stared at her . " Half of everything inside you , " she explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is natural . They are the Jong clan , Cantonese people . Good , honest people . Although sometimes they are bad-tempered and stingy . You know this from your father , how he can be unless I remind him . " And I was thinking to myself , Why is she telling me this ? What does this have to do with anything ? But my mother continued to speak , smiling broadly , sweeping her hand . " And half of everything inside you is from me , your mother 's side , from the Sun clan in Taiyuan . " She wrote the characters out on the back of an envelope , forgetting that I can not read Chinese . " We are a smart people , very strong , tricky , and famous for winning wars . You know Sun Yat-sen , hah ? " I nodded . " He is from the Sun clan . But his family moved to the south many centuries ago , so he is not exactly the same clan . My family has always live in Taiyuan , from before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wei ? " I shook my head . And although I still did n't know where this conversation was going , I felt soothed . It seemed like the first time we had had an almost normal conversation . " He went to battle with Genghis Khan . And when the Mongol soldiers shot at Sun Wei 's warriors  --  heh !  - -  - their arrows bounced off the shields like rain on stone . Sun Wei had made a kind of armor so strong Genghis Khan believed it was magic ! " " Genghis Khan must have invented some magic arrows , then , " I said . " After all , he conquered China . " My mother acted as if she had n't heard me right . " This is true , we always know how to win . So now you know what is inside you , almost all good stuff from Taiyuan. "  | " I guess we 've evolved to just winning in the toy and electronicsmarket , " I said . " How do you know this ? " she asked eagerly . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai ! " she cried loudly . " I 'm not from Taiwan ! " And just like that , the fragile connection we were starting to build snapped . " I was born in China , in Taiyuan , " she said . " Taiwan is not China . " " Well , I only thought you said Taiwan ' because it sounds the same , " I argued , irritated that she was upset by such an unintentionalmistake . " Sound is completely different ! Country is completely different ! " she said in a huff . " People there only dream that it is China , because if you are Chinese you can never let go of China in your mind . " We sank into silence , a stalemate . And then her eyes lighted up . " Now listen . You can also say the name of Taiyuan is Bing . Everyone from that city calls it that . Easier for you to say . Bing , it is a nickname . " She wrote down the character , and I nodded as if this made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she added in English . " You call Apple for New York . Frisco for San Fran-cisco . " " Nobody calls San Francisco that ! " I said , laughing . " People who call it that do n't know any better . " " Now you understand my meaning , " said my mother triumphantly . I smiled . And really , I did understand finally . Not what she had just said . But what had been true all along . I saw what I had been fighting for : It was for me , a scared child , who had run away a long time ago to what I had imagined was a safer place . And hiding in this place , behind my invisible barriers , I knew what lay on the other side : Her side attacks . Her secret weapons . Her uncanny ability to find my weakest spots . But in the brief instant that I had peered over the barriers I could finally see what was really there : an old woman , a wokp184for her armor , a knitting needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited patiently for her daughter to invite her in . Rich and I have decided to postpone our wedding . My mother says July is not a good time to go to China on our honeymoon . She knows this because she and my father have just returned from a trip to Beijing and Taiyuan . " It is too hot in the summer . You will only grow more spots and then your whole face will become red ! " she tells Rich . And Rich grins , gestures his thumb toward my mother , and says to me , " Can you believe what comes out of her mouth ? Now I know where you get your sweet , tactful nature . " " You must go in October . That is the best time . Not too hot , not too cold . I am thinking of going back then too , " she says authoritatively . And then she hastily adds : " Of course not with you ! " I laugh nervously , and Rich jokes : " That 'd be great , Lindo . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not eating snakes or dogs by mistake . " I almost kick ' him . " No , this is not my meaning , " insists my mother . " Really , I am not asking . " And I know what she really means . She would love to go to China with us . And I would hate it . Three weeks ' worth of her complaining about dirty chopsticks and cold soup , three meals a day  --  well , it would be a disaster . Yet part of me also thinks the whole idea makes perfect sense . The three of us , leaving our differences behind , stepping on the plane together , sitting side by side , lifting off , moving West to reach the East.  |p185Without  WoodI used to believe everything my mother said , even when I did n't know what she meant . Once when I was little , she told me she knew it would rain because lost ghosts were circling near our windows , calling " Woo-woo " to be let in . She said doors would unlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice . She said a mirror could see only my face , but she could see me inside out even when I was not in the room . And all these things seemed true to me . The power of her words was that strong . She said that if I listened to her , later I would know what she knew : where true words came from , always from up high , above everything else . And if I did n't listen to her , she said my ear would bend too easily to other people , all saying words that had no lasting meaning , because they came from the bottom of their hearts , where their own desires lived , a place where I could not belong . The words my mother spoke did come from up high . As I recall , I was always looking up at her face as I lay on my pillow . In those days my sisters and I all slept in the same double bed . Janice , my oldest sister , had an allergy that made one nostril sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whistling Nose . Ruth was Ugly Foot because she could spread her toes out in thep186shape of a witch 's claw . I was Scaredy Eyes because I would squeeze shut my eyes so I would n't have to see the dark , which Janice and Ruth said was a dumb thing to do . During those early years , I was the last to fall asleep . I clung to the bed , refusing to mother would whisper in Chinese . According to my mother , Old Mr. Chou was the guardian of a door that opened into dreams . " Are you ready to go see Old Mr. Chou , too ? " And every night I would shake my head . " Old Mr. Chou takes me to bad places , " I cried . Old Mr. Chou took my sisters to sleep . They never rememberedanything from the night before . But Old Mr. Chou would swing the door wide open for me , and as I tried to walk in , he would slam it fast , hoping to squash me like a fly . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But eventually Old Mr. Chou would get tired and leave the door unwatched . The bed would grow heavy at the top and slowly tilt . And I would slide headfirst , in through Old Mr. Chou 's door , and land in a house without doors or windows . I remember one time I dreamt of falling through a hole in Old Mr. Chou 's floor . I found myself in a nighttime garden and Old Mr. Chou was shouting , " Who 's in my backyard ? " I ran away . Soon I found myself stomping on plants with veins of blood , running through fields of snapdragons that changed colors like stoplights , until I came to a giant playground filled with row after row of square sandboxes . In each sandbox was a new doll . And my mother , who was not there but could see me inside out , told Old Mr. Chou she knew which doll I would pick . So I decided to pick one that was entirely different . " Stop her ! Stop her ! " cried my mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chased me , shouting , " See what happens when you do n't listen to your mother ! " And I became paralyzed , too scared to move in any direction . The next morning , I told my mother what happened , and she laughed and said , " Do n't pay attention to Old Mr. Chou . He is only a dream . You only have to listen to me . " And I cried , " But Old Mr. Chou listens to you too . "  |p187More  than thirty years later , my mother was still trying to make me listen . A month after I told her that Ted and I were getting a divorce , I met her at church , at the funeral of China Mary , a wonderful ninety-two-year-old woman who had played godmother to every child who passed through the doors of the First Chinese Baptist Church . " You are getting too thin , " my mother said in her pained voice when I sat down next to her . " You must eat more . " " I 'm fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And besides , was n't it you who said my clothes were always too tight ? " " Eat more , " she insisted , and then she nudged me with a little spiral-bound book hand-titled " Cooking the Chinese Way by China Mary Chan . " They were selling them at the door , only five dollars each , to raise money for the Refugee Scholarship Fund . The organ music stopped and the minister cleared his throat . He was not the regular pastor ; I recognized him as Wing , a boy who used to steal baseball cards with my brother Luke . Only later Wing went to divinity school , thanks to China Mary , and Luke went to the county jail for selling stolen car stereos . " I can still hear her voice , " Wing said to the mourners . " She said God made me with all the right ingredients , so it 'd be a shame if I burned in hell . " " Already cre-mated , " my mother whispered matter-of-factly , nodding toward the altar , where a framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger to my lips the way librarians do , but she did n't get it . " That one , we bought it . " She was pointing to a large spray of yellow chrysanthemums and red roses . " Thirty-four dollars . All artificial , so it will last forever . You can pay me later . Janice and Matthew also chip in some . You have money ? " " Yes , Ted sent me a check . " Then the minister asked everyone to bow in prayer . My mother was quiet at last , dabbing her nose with Kleenex while the minister talked : " I can just see her now , wowing the angels with her Chinese cooking and gung-ho attitude . " And when heads lifted , everyone rose to sing hymn numberp188335 , China Mary 's favorite : " You can be an an-gel , ev-ery day on earth ... " But my mother was not singing . She was staring at me . " Why does he send you a check ? " I kept looking at the hymnal , singing : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And so she grimly answered her own question : " He is doing monkey business with someone else . " Monkey business ? Ted ? I wanted to laugh  --  her choice of words , but also the idea ! Cool , silent , hairless Ted , whose breathing pattern did n't alter one bit in the height of passion ? I could just see him , grunting " Ooh-ooh-ooh " while scratching his armpits , then bouncing and shrieking across the mattress trying to grab a breast . " No , I do n't think so , " I said . " Why not ? " " I do n't think we should talk about Ted now , not here . " " Why can you talk about this with a psyche-atric and not with mother ? " " Psychiatrist . " " Psyche-atricks , " she corrected herself . " A mother is best . A mother knows what is inside you , " she said above the singing voices . " A psyche-atricks will only make you hulihudu , make you see heimongmong . " Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was true . Lately I had been feeling hulihudu . And everything around me seemed to be heimongmong . These were words I had never thought about in English terms . I suppose the closest in meaning would be " confused " and " dark fog . " But really , the words mean much more than that . Maybe they ca n't be easily translated because they refer to a sensation that only Chinese people have , as if you were falling headfirst through Old Mr. Chou 's door , then trying to find your way back . But you 're so scared you ca n't open your eyes , so you get on your hands and knees and grope in the dark , listening for voices to tell you which way to go . I had been talking to too many people , my friends , everybody it seems , except Ted . To each person I told a different story.  |p189Yet  each version was true , I was certain of it , at least at the moment that I told it . To my friend Waverly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I saw how much he could hurt me . I felt such pain , literally a physical pain , as if someone had torn off both my arms without anesthesia , without sewing me back up . " Have you ever had them torn off with anesthesia ? God ! I 've never seen you so hysterical , " said Waverly . " You want my opinion , you 're better off without him . It hurts only because it 's taken you fifteen years to see what an emotional wimp he is . Listen , I know what it feels like . " To my friend Lena , I said I was better off without Ted . After the initial shock , I realized I did n't miss him at all . I just missed the way I felt when I was with him . " Which was what ? " Lena gasped . " You were depressed . You were manipulated into thinking you were nothing next to him . And now you think you 're nothing without him . If I were you , I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . Get even . " I told my psychiatrist I was obsessed with revenge . I dreamt of calling Ted up and inviting him-to dinner , to one of those trendy who's-who places , like Cafe Majestic or Rosalie 's . And after he started the first course and was nice and relaxed , I would say , " It 's not that easy , Ted . " From my purse I would take out a voodoo doll which Lena had already lent me from her props department . I would aim my escargot fork at a strategic spot on the voodoo doll and I would say , out loud , in front of all the fashionable restaurant patrons , " Ted , you 're just such an impotentbastard and I 'm going to make sure you stay that way . " Wham ! Saying this , I felt I had raced to the top of a big turning point in my life , a new me after just two weeks of psychotherapy . But my psychiatrist just looked bored , his hand still propped under his chin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , " he said , sleepy-eyed . " I think we should think about them more next week . " And so I did n't know what to think anymore . For the nextp190few weeks , I inventoried my life , going from room to room trying to remember the history of everything in the house : things I had collected before I met Ted ( the hand-blown glasses , the macramewall hangings , and the rocker I had recaned ) ; things we bought together right after we were married ( most of the big furniture ) ; things people gave us ( the glass-domed clock that no longer worked , three sake sets , four teapots ) ; things he picked out ( the signed lithographs , none of them beyond number twentyfivein a series of two hundred fifty , the Steuben crystal strawberries ) ; and things I picked out because I could n't bear to see them left behind ( the mismatched candlestick holders from garagesales , an antique quilt with a hole in it , odd-shaped vials that once contained ointments , spices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got a letter from Ted , a note actually , written hurriedly in ballpoint on his prescription notepad . " Sign 4x where indicated , " it read . And then in fountain-pen blue ink , " enc : check , to tide you over until settlement . " The note was clipped to our divorce papers , along with a check for ten thousand dollars , signed in the same fountain-pen blue ink on the note . And instead of being grateful , I was hurt . Why had he sent the check with the papers ? Why the two different pens ? Was the check an afterthought ? How long had he sat in his office determining how much money was enough ? And why had he chosen to sign it with that pen ? I still remember the look on his face last year when he carefully undid the gold foil wrap , the surprise in his eyes as he slowly examined every angle of the pen by the light of the Christmas tree . He kissed my forehead . " I 'll use it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remembering that , holding the check , all I could do was sit on the edge of the couch feeling my head getting heavy at the top . I stared at the x 's on the divorce papers , the wording on the prescription notepad , the two colors of ink , the date of the check , the careful way in which he wrote , " Ten thousand only and no cents . " I sat there quietly , trying to listen to my heart , to make thep191right decision . But then I realized I did n't know what the choices were . And so I put the papers and the check away , in a drawer where I kept store coupons which I never threw away and which I never used either . My mother once told me why I was so confused all the time . She said I was without wood . Born without wood so that I listened to too many people . She knew this , because once she had almost become this way . " A girl is like a young tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to your mother standing next to you . That is the only way to grow strong and straight . But if you bend to listen to other people , you will grow crooked and weak . You will fall to the ground with the first strong wind . And then you will be like a weed , growing wild in any direction , running along the ground until someone pulls you out and throws you away . " But by the time she told me this , it was too late . I had already begun to bend . I had started going to school , where a teacher named Mrs. Berry lined us up and marched us in and out of rooms , up and down hallways while she called out , " Boys and girls , follow me . " And if you did n't listen to her , she would make you bend over and whack you with a yardstick ten times . I still listened to my mother , but I also learned how to let her words blow through me . And sometimes I filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English  --  so that when she looked at me inside out , she would be confused by what she saw . Over the years , I learned to choose from the best opinions . Chinese people had Chinese opinions . American people had American opinions . And in almost every case , the American version was much better . It was only later that I discovered there was a serious flaw with the American version . There were too many choices , so it was easy to get confused and pick the wrong thing . That 's how I felt about my situation with Ted . There was so much to think about , so much to decide . Each decision meant a turn in another direction . The check , for example . I wondered if Ted was really trying to trick me , to get me to admit that I was giving up , that Ip192would n't fight the divorce . And if I cashed it , he might later say the amount was the whole settlement . Then I got a little sentimentaland imagined , only for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he truly loved me ; he was telling me in his own way how much I meant to him . Until I realized that ten thousand dollars was nothing to him , that I was nothing to him . I thought about putting an end to this torture and signing the divorce papers . And I was just about to take the papers out of the coupon drawer when I remembered the house . I thought to myself , I love this house . The big oak door that opens into a foyer filled with stained-glass windows . The sunlight in the breakfast room , the south view of the city from the front parlor . The herb and flower garden Ted had planted . He used to work in the garden every weekend , kneeling on a green rubber pad , obsessively inspecting every leaf as if he were manicuring fingernails . He assigned plants to certain planter boxes . Tulips could not be mixed with perennials . A cutting of aloe vera that Lena gave me did not belong anywhere because we had no other succulents . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen and turned brown , the daisies had been crushed down by their own weight , the lettuce gone to seed . Runner weeds were growingbetween the flagstone walkways that wound between the planter boxes . The whole thing had grown wild from months of neglect . And seeing the garden in this forgotten condition reminded me of something I once read in a fortune cookie : When a husband stops paying attention to the garden , he 's thinking of pulling up roots . When was the last time Ted pruned the rosemary back ? When was the last time he squirted Snail B-Gone around the flower beds ? I quickly walked down to the garden shed , looking for pesticidesand weed killer , as if the amount left in the bottle , the expiration date , anything would give me some idea of what was happening in my life . And then I put the bottle down . I had the sense someone was watching me and laughing.  |p193I  went back in the house , this time to call a lawyer . But as I started to dial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What could I say ? What did I want from divorce  --  when I never knew what I had wanted from marriage ? The next morning , I was still thinking about my marriage : fifteen years of living in " Ted 's shadow . I lay in bed , my eyes squeezed shut , unable to make the simplest decisions . I stayed in bed for three days , getting up only to go to the bathroom or to heat up another can of chicken noodle soup . But mostly I slept . I took the sleeping pills Ted had left behind in the medicine cabinet . And for the first time I can recall , I had no dreams . All I could remember was falling smoothly into a dark space with no feeling of dimension or direction . I was the only person in this blackness . And every time I woke up , I took another pill and went back to this place . But on the fourth day , I had a nightmare . In the dark , I could n't see Old Mr. Chou , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , he would squish me into the ground . He was sounding a bell , and the louder the bell rang the closer he was to finding me . I held my breath to keep from screaming , but the bell got louder and louder until I burst awake . It was the phone . It must have rung for an hour nonstop . I picked it up . " Now that you are up , I am bringing you leftover dishes , " said my mother . She sounded as if she could see me now . But the room was dark , the curtains closed tight . " Ma , I ca n't . . . " I said . " I ca n't see you now . I 'm busy . " " Too busy for mother ? " " I have an appointment . . . with my psychiatrist . " She was quiet for a while . " Why do you not speak up for yourself ? " she finally said in her pained voice . " Why can you not talk to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling drained . " Please . Do n't tell me to save my marriage anymore . It 's hard enough as it is . " " I am not telling you to save your marriage , " she protested . " I only say you should speak up . " When I hung up , the phone rang again . It was my **30;16618;TOOLONG . I had missed my appointment that morning , as well as two days ago . Did I want to reschedule ? I said I would look at my schedule and call back . And five minutes later the phone rang again . " Where 've you been ? " It was Ted . I began to shake . " Out , " I said . " I 've been trying to reach you for the last three days . I even called the phone company to check the line . " And I knew he had done that , not out of any concern for me , but because when he wants something , he gets impatient and irrational about people who make him wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said with obvious irritation . " Two weeks ? " " You have n't cashed the check or returned the papers . I wanted to be nice about this , Rose . I can get someone to officially serve the papers , you know . " " You can ? " And then without missing a beat , he proceeded to say what he really wanted , which was more despicable than all the terrible things I had imagined . He wanted the papers returned , signed . He wanted the house . He wanted the whole thing to be over as soon as possible . Becausehe wanted to get married again , to someone else . Before I could stop myself , I gasped . " You mean you were doing monkey business with someone else ? " I was so humiliated I almost started to cry . And then for the first time in months , after being in limbo all that time , everything stopped . All the questions : gone . There were no choices . I had an empty feeling  --  and I felt free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear someone laughing ; . " What 's so funny ? " said Ted angrily . " Sorry , " I said . " It 's just that . . . " and I was trying hard to stifle my giggles , but one of them escaped through my nose with a snort , which made me laugh more . And then Ted 's silence made me laugh even harder . I was still gasping when I tried to begin again in a more evenp195voice : " Listen , Ted , sorry . . . I think the best thing is for you to come over after work . " I did n't know why I said that , but I felt right saying it . " There 's nothing to talk about , Rose . " " I know , " I said in a voice so calm it surprised even me . " I just want to show you something . And do n't worry , you 'll get your papers . Believe me . " I had no plan . I did n't know what I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted to see me one more time before the divorce . What I ended up showing him was the garden . By the time he arrived , the late-afternoon summer fog had already blown in . I had the divorce papers in the pocket of my windbreaker . Ted was shivering in his sports jacket as he surveyed the damage to the garden . " What a mess , " I heard him mutter to himself , trying to shake his pant leg loose of a blackberry vine that had meandered onto the walkway . And I knew he was calculating how long it would take to get the place back into order . " I like it this way , " I said , patting the tops of overgrown carrots , their orange heads pushing through the earth as if about to be born . And then I saw the weeds : Some had sprouted in and out of the cracks in the patio . Others had anchored on the side of the house . And even more had found refuge under loose shingles and were on their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out once they 've buried themselves in the masonry ; you 'd end up pulling the whole building down . Ted was picking up plums from the ground and tossing them over the fence into the neighbor 's yard . " Where are the papers ? " he finally said . I handed them to him and he stuffed them in the inside pocket of his jacket . He faced me and I saw his eyes , the look I had once mistaken for kindness and protection . " You do n't have to move out right away , " he said . " I know you 'll want at least a month to find a place . " " I 've already found a place , " I said quickly , because **29;16650;TOOLONG long to get married and move out . ) At two she phoned again , but her mother said there 'd been nothing for her . That evening , walking to choir practice , she counted up the days once more and realized that Mr. Moran might not have received her letter on Tuesday after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remembered . This made her feel better . She started walking faster , waving at Serena when she spotted her on the steps of the church . Mr. Nichols was late , and the choir members joked and gossiped while they waited for him . They were all a little heady now that spring was here  --  even old Mrs. Britt . The church windows were open and they could hear the neighborhood childrenplaying out on the sidewalk . The night air smelled of newly cut grass . Mr. Nichols , when he arrived , wore a sprig of lavender in his buttonhole . He must have bought it from the street vendor , who had only that morning appeared with his cart for the first time that year . " Sony , ladies and gentlemen , " Mr. Nichols said . He set his briefcase on a pew and rooted through it for his notes . The church door opened again and in walked Ira Moran . He was very tall and somber , in a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and slim black trousers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were something lumpy in his mouth . Maggie felt her heart stop . She felt icy at first and then overheated , but she stared through him blankly with dry , wide eyes , keeping her thumb in place in the hymnbook . Even in that first moment , she knew he was n't a ghost or a mirage . He was as real as the gummy varnished pews , not so flawlessly assembled as she had pictured but more intricately textured  --  more physical , somehow ; more complicated . Mr. Nichols said , " Oh , Ira . Glad to see you . " " Thanks , " Ira said . Then he filed through the folding chairs toward the rear , where the men sat , and he took a seat . But Maggie saw how his gaze first skimmed the women in front ,  |p101resting  finally on her . She could tell he knew about the letter . She felt a flush pass over her face . Ordinarily graceful out of pure caution , pure timidity , she had been caught in an error so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet another person 's eyes . She sang numbly , standing and sitting as ordered . She sang " Once to Every Man and Nation " and " Shall We Gather at the River . " Then Mr. Nichols had the men do " Shall We Gather at the River " on their own , and then he asked the accompanist to repeat a certain passage . While this was going on , Maggie leaned toward Mrs. Britt and whispered , " Was n't that the Moran boy ? The one who came in late ? " " Why , yes , I believe it was , " Mrs. Britt said pleasantly . " Did n't you tell us he 'd been killed ? " " I did ? " Mrs. Britt asked . She looked surprised and sat back in her chair . A moment later , she sat forward again and said , " That was the Rand boy who was killed . Monty Rand . " " Oh , " Maggie said . . Monty Rand had been a little pale dishcloth of a person with an incongruously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After choir practice she gathered her belongings as quickly as possible and was first out the door , scuttling down the sidewalk with her purse hugged to her chest , but she had n't even reached the corner when she heard Ira behind her . " Maggie ? " he called . She slowed beneath a streetlight and then stopped , not lookingaround . He came up next to her . His legs made a shadow like scissors on the sidewalk . " Mind if I walk your way ? " he said . " Do what you like , " she told him shortly . He fell into step beside her . " So how 've you been ? " he asked . " I 'm okay . " " You 're out of school now , right ? "  |p102She  nodded . They crossed a street . " Got a job ? " he asked . " I work at the Silver Threads Nursing Home . " " Oh . Well , good . " He started whistling the last hymn they had practiced : " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands in his pockets . They passed a couple kissing at a bus stop . Maggie cleared her throat and said , " Silly me ! I mixed you up with the Rand boy . " " Rand ? " " Monty Rand ; he got killed in boot camp and I thought they said it was you . " She still did n't look at him , although he was near enough so she could smell his fresh-ironed shirt . She wondered who had ironed it . One of his sisters , probably . What did that have to do with anything ? She tightened her hold on her purse and walked faster , but Ira kept up with her . She was conscious of his dark , hooked presence at her elbow . " So now will you write to Monty 's father ? " he asked her . When she risked a sidelong glance she saw the humorous pleat at the corner of his mouth . " Go ahead and laugh , " she told him . " I 'm not laughing . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you hear me laughing ? " They had reached her block now . She could see her house up ahead , part of a string of row houses , the porch glowing orange beneath the bugproof light . This time when she stopped she looked directly into his face , and he returned the look without a hint of a smile , keeping his hands shoved in his pockets . She had n't expected his eyes to be so narrow . He could have been Asian , rather than Indian . " Your father must have split his sides , " she said . " No , he was just . . . he just asked me what it could mean . "  |p103She  tried to think what words she had used in the letter . Special , she 'd written . Oh , Lord . And worse yet : wonderful . She wished she could disappear . " I remember you from choir practice , " Ira said . " You 're Josh 's sister , right ? But I guess we never really knew each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Goodness ! We were total strangers . " She tried to sound brusque and sensible . He studied her a moment . Then he said , " So do you think we might get to know each other now ? " " Well , " she said , " I do go out with someone . " " Really ? Who ? " " Boris Drumm , " she said . " Oh , yes . " She looked off toward her house . She said , " We 'll probably get married . " " I see , " he said . " Well , goodbye , " she told him . He lifted a hand in silence , thought a moment , and then turned and walked away . That Sunday , though , he came to sing with the choir at the morning service . Maggie felt relieved , almost lightweight with relief , as if she 'd been given a second chance , and then her heart sank when he just melted into the crowd again after church . But Thursday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home when it was over . They talked about trivial subjects-Mrs . Britt 's splintery voice , for instance . Maggie grew more comfortable . When they reached her house she saw her neighbor 's dog out front , peeing on Maggie 's mother 's one rosebush , with the neighbor standing there watching ; so she called , " Hey , lady ! Get your dog out of our yard , you hear ? " She was joking ; it was the rough style of humor she had picked up from her brothers . But Ira did n't know that and he looked taken aback . Then Mrs. Wright laughed and said , " You and who else going to make me , kid ? " and Ira relaxed . But Maggie felt she 'd beenp104clumsy once again , and she murmured a hasty good night and went inside . Soon enough it became a pattern  --  Thursday nights and Sunday mornings . People started to notice . Maggie 's mother said , " Maggie ? Does Boris know about this new friendship of yours ? " and Maggie snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at best a half-truth . ( Maggie 's mother thought Boris was God 's gift to women . ) But Serena said , " Good for you ! High time you dumped Mr. Holier-than-Thou . " " I have n't dumped him ! " " Why not ? " Serena asked . " When you compare him to Ira ! Ira 's so mysterious . " " Well , he is part Indian , of course , " Maggie said . " And you have to admit he 's attractive . " Oh , Jesse was not the only one who 'd been swayed by a single friend ! Certainly Serena had more than a little to do with all that happened afterward . She asked Maggie and Ira to sing a duet at her wedding , for instance . Out of the blue ( for Ira had never been thought to have a particularly striking voice ) , she took it into her head that they should sing " Love is a Many Splendored Thing " before the exchange of vows . So of course they had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house . They commiserated with each other and they clucked over Serena 's musical taste , but it never occurred to them to refuse her . Maggie 's mother kept tiptappingin and out with folded laundry that had no business in the living room . " Once , ' " they sang , " on a high and windy hill , ' " and then Maggie sputtered into laughter , but Ira remainedsober . Maggie seemed to be turning into someone else , those days  --  someone giddy and unstable and accident-prone . Sometimes she imagined that that sympathy note had thrown her permanently off balance . She knew by then that Ira ran his father 's frame shop singlehanded  --  Sam 's " weak heart " had got to him the day after Ira'sp105high-school graduation  --  and that he lived above the shop with his father and his two much older sisters , one of whom was a little slow and the other just shy or retiring or something . He wanted to go to college , though , if he could ever scrape together the money . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told her this in a neutral tone ; he did n't seem discouragedabout the way his life was turning out . Then he said maybe she 'd like to come home with him sometime and meet his sisters ; they did n't get to talk to very many people . But Maggie said , " No ! " and then flushed and said , " Oh , I guess I 'd better not , " and pretended not to notice his amusement . She was afraid she 'd run into his father . She wondered if his sisters knew about the letter too , but she did n't want to ask . Never , not once in all this time , did he act any more than mildly friendly . When necessary he would take her arm  --  just to steer her through a crowd , say  --  and his hand felt firm and warm on her bare skin ; but as soon as they 'd passed the crowd he would release her . She was n't even sure what he thought of her . She was n't sure what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was Boris to consider . She went on writing Boris regularly  --  if anything , a little more often than usual . Serena 's wedding rehearsal was a Friday evening . It was n't a very formal rehearsal . Max 's parents , for instance , did n't even bother attending , although Serena 's mother showed up with her hair in a million pink rollers . And events happened out of order , with Maggie ( standing in for the bride , for good luck ) coming down the aisle ahead of all the musical selections because Max had a trainload of relatives to meet in half an hour . She walked alongside Anita , which was one of Serena 's more peculiar innovations . " Who else could give me away ? " Serena asked . " You surely do n't imagine my father would do it . " Anita herself , however , did n't seem so happy with this arrangement . She teeteredand staggered in her spike-heeled shoes and dug her long red nails into Maggie 's wrist in order to keep her balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoot , maybe he 'd just settle for her instead ; and Serena , sitting in a center pew , called , " That 'll be quite enough of that , Max Gill ! " Max was the same freckled , friendly , overgrown boy he 'd always been . It was hard for Maggie to picture him married . After the vows Max left for Penn Station and the rest of them practiced the music . They all performed in a fairly amateurishstyle , Maggie thought , which was fine with her because she and Ira did n't sound their best that night . They started off raggedly , and Maggie forgot that they had planned to split up the middle verse . She sailed right into the first two lines along with Ira , then stopped in confusion , then missed her own cue and fell into a fit of giggles . At that moment , the laughter not yet faded from her face , she saw Boris Drumm in the foremost pew . He wore a baffled , rumpled frown , as if someone had just awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for the summer , but he had n't told her which day . She pretended not to recognize him . She and Ira finished their song , and then she reverted to Serena 's role and marched back up the aisle , minus Max , so Sugar could practice the timing on " Born to Be with You . " After that Serena clapped her hands and shouted , " Okay , gang ! " and they prepared to leave , all talking at once . They were thinking of going out for pizza . They swarmed toward Maggie , who waited at the rear of the church , but Boris stayed where he was , facing forward . He would be expecting Maggie to join him . She studied the back of his head , which was block-like and immobile . Serena handed her her purse and said , " You 've got company , I see . " Right behind Serena was Ira . He stopped in front of Maggie and looked down at her . He said , " Will you be going for pizza ? " Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blank-faced , and left . But he walked in a differentdirection from the others , as if he did n't feel they wouldp107welcome him without Maggie . Which of course was nonsense . Maggie went back up the aisle and sat next to Boris , and they kissed . She said , " How was your trip ? " and he said , " Who was that you were singing with ? " at exactly the same instant . She pretended she had n't heard . " How was your trip ? " she asked again , and he said , " Was n't that Ira Moran ? " " Who , the one singing ? " she asked . " That was Ira Moran ! You told me he was dead ! " " It was a misunderstanding , " she said . " I heard you say it , Maggie . " " I mean I misunderstood that he was dead . He was only , um , wounded . " " Ah , " Boris said . He turned that over in his mind . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie told him . " A scalp wound . " She wondered if the two terms contradicted each other . She riffled quickly through various movies she had seen . " So then what ? He just comes walking in one day ? " Boris asked . " I mean he just pops up , like some kind of ghost ? How did it happen , exactly ? " " Boris , " Maggie said , " I fail to comprehend why you keep dwelling on this in such a tiresome fashion . " " Oh . Well . Sorry , " Boris said . ( Had she really sounded so authoritative ? She found it hard to imagine , looking back . ) On the morning of the wedding , Maggie got up early and walked to Serena 's apartment the second floor of a formstone row house  --  to help her dress . Serena seemed unruffled but her mother was all in a dither . Anita 's habit when she was nervous was to speak very fast and with practically no punctuation , like someone in a hard-sell commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else when I told her way last week I said hon nobody wears long hair anymore you ought to go to the beauty shop and get you a nice little flip to peek out under your veil . . . " She was rushing around the shabby , sparsely equippedp108kitchen in a dirty pink satin bathrobe , with a cigarette dangling from her lips . She was making a great clatter but not much was getting accomplished . Serena , lazy and nonchalant in one of Max 's big shirts , said , " Take it easy , Mom , will you ? " She told Maggie , " Mom thinks we ought to change the whole ceremony . " Change it how ? " Maggie asked . " She does n't have any bridesmaids ! " Anita said . " She does n't have a maid of honor even and what 's worse there 's no kind of masculine person to walk her down the aisle ! " " She 's upset she has to walk me down the aisle , " Serena told Maggie . " Oh if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Anita cried . " Maybe we should move the wedding up a week and give him another chance because the way you have it now is all cockeyed it 's too oddball I can just picture how those hoity-toity Gills will be scrupulizing me and smirking amongst themselves and besides that last perm I got scorched the tip-ends of my hair I ca n't walk down the aisle . " " Let 's go get me dressed , " Serena told Maggie , and she led her away . In Serena 's room , which was really just half of Anita 's room curtained off with a draggled aqua bed sheet , Serena sat down at her vanity table . She said , " I thought of giving her a belt of whiskey , but I worried it might backfire . " Maggie said , " Serena , are you sure you ought to be marrying Max ? " Serena squawked and wheeled to face her . She said , " Maggie Daley , do n't you start with me ! I 've already got my wedding cake frosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How can you be certain you chose the right man ? " " I can be certain because I 've come to the end of the line , " Serena said , turning back to the mirror . Her voice was at normalp109level now . She patted on liquid foundation , expertly dotting her chin and forehead and cheeks . " It 's just time to marry , that 's all , " she said . " I 'm so tired of dating ! I 'm so tired of keeping up a good front ! I want to sit on the couch with a regular , normal husband and watch TV for a thousand years . It 's going to be like getting out of a girdle ; that 's exactly how I picture it . " " What are you saying ? " Maggie asked . She was almost afraid of the answer . " Are you telling me you do n't really love Max ? " " Of course I love him , " Serena said . She blended the dots into her skin . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson our sophomore year  --  remember him ? But it was n't time to get married then , so Terry is not the one I 'm marrying . " Maggie did n't know what to think . Did everybody feel that way ? Had the grownups been spreading fairy tales ? " The minute I saw Eleanor , " her oldest brother had told her once , " I said , That girl is going to be my wife someday . ' " It had n't occurred to Maggie that he might simply have been ready for a wife , and therefore had his eye out for the likeliest prospect . So there again , Serena had managed to color Maggie 's view of things . " We 're not in the hands of fate after all , " she seemed to be saying . " Or if we are , we can wrest ourselves free any time we care to . " Maggie sat down on the bed and watched Serena applying her rouge . In Max 's shirt , Serena looked casual and sporty , like anybody 's girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told Maggie , " I 'm going to dye my wedding dress purple . Might as well get some use out of it . " Maggie gazed at her thoughtfully . The wedding was due to start at eleven , but Anita wanted to get to the church much earlier , she said , in case of mishaps . Maggie rode with them in Anita 's ancient Chevrolet . Serena drove because Anita said she was too nervous , and since Serena 's skirt billowed over so much of the seat , Maggie and Anita satp110in back . Anita was talking nonstop and sprinkling cigarette ashes across the lap of her shiny peach mother-of-the-bride dress . " Now that I think of it Serena I ca n't imagine why you 're holding your reception in the Angels of Charity building which is so damn far away and every time I 've tried to find it I 've gotten all turned around and had to ask directions from passing strangers ... " They came to the Alluring Lingerie Shop , and Serena double-parked and heaved her cascades of satin out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Knowlton , her employer . While they waited for her , Anita said , " Honestly you 'd suppose if you can rent a man to come tend your bar or fix your toilet or check on why your door wo n't lock it would n't be any problem at all to engage one for the five eentsy minutes it takes to walk your daughter down the aisle do n't you agree ? " " Yes , ma'am , " Maggie said , and she dug absently into ahole in the vinyl seat and pulled out a wad of cotton batting . " Sometimes I think she 's trying to show me up , " Anita said . Maggie did n't know how to answer that . Finally Serena returned to the car , bearing a wrapped gift . " Mrs. Knowlton told me not to open this till our wedding night , " she said . Maggie blushed and slid her eyes toward Anita . Anita merely gazed out the window , sending two long streamers of smoke from her nostrils . In the church , Reverend Connors led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to wait for the other singers . Mary Jean was already there , and soon Sissy arrived with her husband and her mother-in-law . No Ira , though . Well , there was plenty of time . Maggie took her long white choir robe from its hanger and slipped it over her head , losing herself in its folds , and then of course she emerged all tousled and had to go off to comb her hair . But even when she returned , Ira was not to be seen . The first of the guests had arrived . Boris sat in one of thep111pews , uncomfortably close . He was listening to a lady in a spotted veil and he was nodding intelligently , respectfully , but Maggie felt there was something tense about the set of his head . She looked toward the entrance . Other people were straggling in now , her parents and the Wrights next door and Serena 's old baton teacher . No sign of the long , dark shape that was Ira Moran . After she had let him walk off alone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Excuse me , " she said . She bumped down the row of folding chairs and hurried through the vestibule . One of her full sleeves caught on the knob of the open door and yanked her up short in a foolish way , but she shook herself loose before anybody noticed , she thought . She paused on the front steps . " Well , hi ! " an old classmate said . " Urn . . . " Maggie murmured , and she shaded her eyes and looked up and down the street . All she saw were more guests . She felt a moment 's impatience with them ; they seemed so frivolous . They were smiling and greeting each other in that gracious style they used only at church , and the women turned their toes out fastidiously as they walked , and their white gloves glinted in the sunlight . In the doorway , Boris said , " Maggie ? " She did n't turn around . She ran down the steps with her robe flowing behind her . The steps were the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she was forced to adopt a limping , uneven rhythm . " Maggie ! " Boris cried , so she had to run on after reaching the sidewalk . She shouldered her way between guests and then was past them , skimming down the street , ballooning white linen like a sailboat in a wind . Sam 's Frame Shop was only two blocks from the church , but they were long blocks and it was a warm June morning . She was damp and breathless when she arrived . She pulled open the plate-glass door and stepped into a close , cheerlessp112interior with a worn linoleum floor . L-shaped samples of moldingshung from hooks on a yellowing pegboard wall , and the counter was painted a thick , cold gray . Behind this counter stood a bent old man in a visor , with shocks of white hair poking every which way . Ira 's father . She was surprised to find him there . The way she 'd heard it , he never set foot in the shop anymore . She hesitated , and he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought Ira had the darkest eyes she 'd ever seen , but this man 's eyes were darker . She could n't even tell where they were focused ; she had the fleeting notion that he might be blind . " I was looking for Ira , " she told him . " Ira 's not working today . He 's got some kind of event . " " Yes , a wedding ; he 's singing at a wedding , " she said . " But he has n't shown up yet , so I came to get him . " " Oh ? " Sam said . He moved his head closer to her , leading with his nose , not lessening in the least his impression of a blind man . " You would n't be Margaret , would you ? " he asked . " Yes , sir , " she said . He thought that over . He gave an abrupt , wheezy chuckle . " Margaret M. Daley , " he said . She stood her ground . " So you assumed Ira was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " He 's upstairs , dressing . " " Could you call him , please ? " " How did you suppose he 'd died ? " he asked her . " I mistook him for someone else . Monty Rand , " she said , mumbling the words . " Monty got killed in boot camp . " " Boot camp ! " " Could you call Ira for me , please ? " " You 'd never find Ira in boot camp , " Sam told her . " Ira 's got dependents , just as much as if he was married . Not that hep113ever could be married in view of our situation . My heart has been acting up on me for years and one of his sisters is not quite right in the head . Why , I do n't believe the army would have him even if he volunteered ! Then me and the girls would have to go on welfare ; we 'd be a burden on the government . Get along with you , ' those army folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you . We 've got no use for you here . ' " Maggie heard feet running down a set of stairs somewhere  --  a muffled , drumming sound . A door opened in the pegboard wall behind the counter and Ira said , " Pop  --  " He stopped and looked at her . He wore a dark , ill-fitting suit and a stiff white shirt , with a navy tie dangling unknotted from his collar . " We 'll be late for the wedding , " she told him . He shot back a cuff and checked his watch . " Come on ! " she said . It was n't only the wedding she was thinking of . She felt there was something dangerous about stayingaround Ira 's father . And sure enough , Sam said , " Me and your little friend here was just discussing you going into the army . " " Army ? " ? " Ira could n't join the army , I told her . He 's got us . " Ira said , " Well , anyhow , Pop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours . " " You really have to take that long ? That 's most of the morning ! " Sam turned to Maggie and said , " Saturday 's our busiest day at work . " Maggie wondered why , in that case , the shop was empty . She said , " Yes , well , we should be  --  " " In fact , if Ira joined the army we 'd just have to close this place up , " Sam said . " Sell it off lock , stock , and barrel , when it 's been in the family for forty-two years come October . " " What are you talking about ? " Ira asked him . " Why would I want to join the army ? "  | " Your little friend here thought you 'd gone into the army and got yourself killed , " Sam told him . " Oh , " Ira said . Now the danger must have dawned on him too , for this time it was he who said , " We should be going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot camp , " Sam told him . He gave another of his wheezy chuckles . There was something mole-like and relentless about that way he led with his nose , Maggie felt . " Ups and writes me a letter of condolence , " he said . " Ha ! " He told Maggie , " Gave me quite a start . I had this half-second or so where I thought , Wait a minute . Has Ira passed ? First I knew of it , if so . And first I 'd heard of you . First I 'd heard of any girl , matter of fact , in years . I mean it 's not like he has any friends anymore . His chums at school were that brainy crowd that went away to college and by now they 've all lost touch with him and he does n't see a soul his own age . Look here ! ' I told him . A girl at last ! ' After I 'd withstood the shock . Better grab her while you got the chance , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira said to Maggie . He lifted a hinged section of the counter and stepped through it , but Sam went on talking . " Trouble is , now you know she can manage fine without you , " he said . Ira paused , still holding up the hinged section . " She writes a little note of condolence and then continues with her life , as merry as pie , " Sam told him . " What did you expect her to do , throw herself in my grave ? " " Well , you got to admit she bore up under her grief mighty well . Writes me a nice little note , sticks a postage stamp in one corner , then carries on with her girlfriend 's wedding arrangements . " " Right , " Ira said , and he lowered the counter and came over to Maggie . Was he totally impenetrable ? His eyes were flat , and his hand , when he took her arm , was perfectly steady . " You 're wrong , " Maggie told Sam.  | " Huh ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely existing . " " No need to get all het up about it , " Sam said . " And for your information , there 's any number of girls who think he 's perfectly wonderful and I am not the only one and also it 's ridiculous to say he ca n't get married . You have no right ; anyone can get married if they want to . " " He would n't dare ! " Sam told her . " He 's got me and his sisters to think of . You want us all in the poorhouse ? Ira ? Ira , you would n't dare to get married ! " " Why not ? " Ira asked calmly . " You 've got to think of me and your sisters ! " " I 'm marrying her anyhow , " Ira said . Then he opened the door and stood back to let Maggie walk through it . On the stoop outside , they stopped and he put his arms around her and drew her close . She could feel the narrow bones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating in her ear . His father must have been able to see everything through the plate-glass door , but even so Ira bent his head and kissed her on the lips , a long , warm , searching kiss that turned her knees weak . Then they started off toward the church , although first there was a minor delay because the hem of her choir robe caught her up short . Ira had to open the door once again ( not even glancing at his father ) and set her loose . But to look at Serena 's movie , would you guess what had come just before ? They seemed an ordinary couple , maybe a bit mismatched as to height . He was too tall and thin and she was too short and plump . Their expressions were grave but they certainly did n't look as if anything earth-shattering had recently taken place . They opened and closed their mouths in silence while the audience sang for them , poking gentle fun , intoning melodramatically . " Love is Nature 's way of giving , a reasonp116to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand had braced the small of her back . Then the Barley twins leaned into each other and sang the processional , their faces raised like baby birds ' faces ; and the camera swung from them to Serena all in white . Serena sailed down the aisle with her mother hanging on to her . Funny : From this vantage neither one of them seemed particularly unconventional . Serena stared straight ahead , intent . Anita 's makeup was a little too heavy but she could have been anybody 's mother , really , anxious-looking and outdated in her tight dress . " Look at you ! " someone told Serena , laughing . Meanwhile the audience sang , " Though I do n't know many words to say .. But then the camera jerked and swooped and there was Max , waiting next to Reverend Connors in front of the altar . One by one , the singers trailed off . Sweet Max , pursing his chapped lips and squinting his blue eyes in an attempt to seem fittingly dignified as he watched Serena approaching . Everything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like metal spangles across his broad cheeks . Maggie felt tears welling up . Several people blew their noses . No one , she thought , had suspected back then that it would all turn out to be so serious . But of course the mood brightened again , because the song went on too long and the couple had to stand in position , with Reverend Connors beaming at them , while the Barley twins wound down . And by the time the vows were exchanged and Sugar rose to sing the recessional , most of the people in the audience were nudging each other expectantly . For who could forget what came next ? Max escorted Serena back down the aisle far too slowly , employing a measured , hitching gait that he must have thought appropriate . Sugar 's song was over and done with before they had finished exiting . Serena tugged at Max 's elbow , spoke ur/gently in his ear , traveled almost backward for the last few feet as she towed him into the vestibule . And then once they were out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispers , rising to hisses , rising to shouts ! " If you 'd stayed through the goddamn rehearsal , " Serena had cried , " instead of tearing off to Penn Station for your never-ending relatives and leaving me to practiceon my own so you had no idea how fast to walk me  --  " The congregation had remained seated , not knowing where to look . They 'd grinned sheepishly at their laps , and finally broke into laughter . " Serena , honey , " Max had said , " pipe down . For Lord 's sake , Serena , everyone can hear you , Serena , honey pie ... " Naturally none of this was apparent from the movie , which was finished anyhow except for a few scarred numerals flashing by . But all around the room people were refreshing other people'srecollections , bringing the scene back to life . " And then she stalked out  --  " " Slammed the church door  --  " " Shook the whole building , ' remember ? " " Us just staring back toward the vestibule wondering how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serena herself . The room was filled with light . Serena was smiling but her cheeks were wet . People were saying , " And then , Serena . . . " and , " Remember , Serena ? " and she was nodding and smiling and crying . The old lady next to Maggie said , " Dear , dear Maxwell , " and sighed , perhaps not even aware of the others ' merriment . Maggie rose and collected her purse . She wanted Ira ; she felt lost without Ira . She looked around for him but saw only the others , meaningless and bland . She threaded her way to the dining alcove , but he was n't among the guests who stood picking over the platters of food . She walked down the hall and peeked into Serena 's bedroom . And there he was , seated at the bureau . He 'd pulled a chairp118up close and moved Linda 's graduation picture out of the way so he could spread a solitaire layout clear across the polished surface . One angular brown hand was poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and shut the door . She set her purse down and wrapped her arms around him from behind . " You missed a good movie , " she said into his hair . " Serena showed a film of her wedding . " " Is n't that just like her , " Ira said . He placed the jack on a queen . His hair smelled like coconut  --  its natural scent , which always came through sooner or later no matter what shampoo he used . " You and I were singing our duet , " she said . " And I suppose you got all teary and nostalgic . " " Yes , I did , " she told him . " Is n't that just like you , " he said . " Yes , it is , " she said , and she smiled into the mirror in front of them . She felt she was almost boasting , that she 'd made a kind of proclamation . If she was easily swayed , she thought , at least she had chosen who would sway her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least she had chosen what that pattern would be . She felt strong and free and definite . She watched Ira scoop up a whole row of diamonds , ace through ten , and lay them on the jack . " We looked like children , " she told him . " Like infants . We were hardly older than Daisy is now ; just imagine . And thought nothing of deciding then and there who we 'd spend the next sixty years with . " " Mmhmm , " Ira said . He pondered a king , while Maggie laid her cheek on the top of his head . She seemed to have fallen in love again . In love with her own husband ! The convenience of it pleased her  --  like finding right in her pantry all the fixings she needed for a new recipe . " Remember the first year we were married ? " she asked him . " It was awful . We fought every minute . " " Worst year of my life , " he agreed , and when she movedp119around to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lap . His thighs beneath her were long and bony  --  two planks of lumber . " Careful of my cards , " he told her , but she could feel he was getting interested . She laid her head on his shoulder and traced the stitching of his shirt pocket with one finger . " That Sunday we invited Max and Serena to dinner , remember ? Our very first guests . We rearranged the furniture five times before they got there , " she said . " I 'd go out in the kitchen and come back to find you 'd shifted all the chairs into corners , and I 'd say , What have you done ? ' and shift them all some other way , and by the time the Gills arrived , the coffee table was upside down on the couch and you and I were having a shouting quarrel . " " We were scared to death , is what it was , " Ira said . He had his arms around her now ; she felt his amused , dry voice vibrating through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grownups but we did n't know if we could pull it off . " " And then our first anniversary , " Maggie said . " What a fiasco ! Mother 's etiquette book said it was either the paper anniversaryor the clock anniversary , whichever I preferred . So I got this bright idea to construct your gift from a kit I saw advertisedin a magazine : a working clock made out of paper . " " I do n't remember that . " " That 's because I never gave it to you , " Maggie said . " What happened to it ? " " Well , I must have put it together wrong , " Maggie said . " I mean I followed all the directions , but it never really acted like it was supposed to . It dragged , it stopped and started , one edge curled over , there was a ripple under the twelve where I 'd used too much glue . It was . . . makeshift , amateur . I was so ashamed of it , I threw it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I was afraid it was a symbol or something , I mean a symbol of our marriage . We were makeshift ourselves , is what I was afraid of . "  |p120He  said , " Shoot , we were just learning back then . We did n't know what to do with each other . " " We know now , " she whispered . Then she pressed her mouth into one of her favorite places , that nice warm nook where his jaw met his neck . Meanwhile her fingers started traveling down to his belt buckle . Ira said , " Maggie ? " but he made no move to stop her . She straightened up to loosen his belt and unzip his fly . " We can sit right here in this chair , " she whispered . " No one will ever guess . " Ira groaned and pulled her against him . When he kissed her his lips felt smooth and very firm . She thought she could hear her own blood flooding through her veins ; it made a rushing sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Ira started violently and Maggie jumped up from his lap . Serena stood frozen with one hand on the doorknob . She was gaping at Ira , at his open zipper and his shirttail flaring out . Well , it could have gone in either direction , Maggie figured . You never knew with Serena . Serena could have just laughed it off . But maybe the funeral had been too much for her , or the movie afterward , or just widowhood in general . At any rate , she said , " I do n't believe this . I do not believe it . " Maggie said , " Serena  --  " " In my own house ! My bedroom ! " " I 'm sorry ; please , we 're both so sorry . . . " Maggie said , and Ira , hastily righting his clothes , said , " Yes , we honestly did n't  --  " " You always were impossible , " Serena told Maggie . " I suspectit 's deliberate . No one could act so goofy purely by chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nursinghome . And now this ! At a funeral gathering ! In the bedroom I shared with my husband ! " " It was an accident , Serena . We never meant to  --  "  | " An accident ! " Serena said . " Oh , just go . " " What ? " " Just leave , " she said , and she wheeled and walked away . Maggie picked up her purse , not looking at Ira . Ira collected his cards . She went through the doorway ahead of him and they walked down the hall to the living room . People stood back a little to let them pass . She had no idea how much they had heard . Probably everything ; there was something hushed and thrilled about them . She opened the front door and then turned around and said , " Well , bye now ! " " Goodbye , " they murmured . " Bye , Maggie , bye , Ira ... " Outside , the sunlight was blinding . She wished they 'd driven over from the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and picked her way along the gravel next to the road , fixing her eyes on her pumps , which had developed a thin film of dust . " Well , " Ira said finally , " we certainly livened up that little gathering . " " I feel just terrible , " Maggie said . " Oh , it 'll blow over , " Ira told her . " You know how she is . " Then he gave a snort and said , " Just look on the bright side . As class reunions go  --  " " But it was n't a Glass reunion ; it was a funeral , " Maggie said . " A memorial service . I went and ruined a memorial service ! She probably thinks we were showing off or something , taunting her now that she 's a widow . I feel terrible . " " She 'll forgive us , " he told her . A car swished by and he changed places with her , setting her to the inside away from the traffic . Now they walked slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal selves . Or almost back . Not entirely . Some trick of light or heat blurred Maggie 's vision , and the stony old house they were passing seemed to shimmer for a moment . It dissolved in a gentle , radiant haze , and then it regrouped itself and grew solid again.  |p125For  the past several months now , Ira had been noticing the human race 's wastefulness . People were squandering their lives , it seemed to him . They were splurging their energies on petty jealousies or vain ambitions or long-standing , bitter grudges . It was a theme that emerged wherever he turned , as if someone were trying to tell him something . Not that he needed to be told . Did n't he know well enough all he himself had wasted ? He was fifty years old and had never accomplished one single act of consequence . Once he had planned to find a cure for some major disease and now he was framing petit point instead . His son , who could n't carry a tune , had dropped out of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those people who fritter themselves away on unnecessary worries ; she chewed her fingernails to nubbins and developed blinding headaches before exams and agonized so over her grades that their doctor had warned of ulcers . And his wife ! He loved her , but he could n't stand how she refused to take her own life seriously . She seemed to believe it was a sort of practice life , something she could afford to play around with as if they offered second and third chances to getp126it right . She was always making clumsy , impetuous rushes towardnowhere in particular  --  side trips , random detours . Like today , for instance : this Fiona business . Fiona was no longer any relation , not their daughter-in-law and not even an acquaintance , in Ira 's opinion . But here Maggie sat , trailing a hand out the window as they whizzed down Route One toward home , and what did she return to ( just when he was hoping she 'd forgotten ) but her whim to pay Fiona a visit . Bad enough they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of side trip in itself  --  but now she wanted to plunge off in a whole new direction . She wanted to swing by Cartwheel , Pennsylvania , just so she could offer to baby-sit while Fiona went on her honeymoon . A completely pointless proposal ; for Fiona did have a mother , did n't she , who 'd been tending Leroy all along and surely could be counted on for the next little bit as well . Ira pointed that out . He said , " What 's the matter with what's-hername ? Mrs. Stuckey ? " " Oh , Mrs. Stuckey , " Maggie said , as if that were answer enough . She brought in her hand and rolled up the window . Her face glowed in the sunlight , round and pretty and intense . The breeze had ruffled her hair so it stood out in loops all over her head . It was a hot , gasoline-smelling breeze and Ira was n't sorry to have lost it . However , this constant opening and shutting of the window was getting on his nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never looked any distance ahead . A spasm of irritation darted raggedly through his temples . Here was a woman who had once let a wrong number consume an entire evening . " Hello ? " she 'd said into the phone , and a man had said , " Laverne , stay right there safe in your house . I just talked to Dennis and he 's coming to fetch you . " And then had hung up . Maggie cried , " Wait ! "  --  speaking into a dead receiver ; typical . Whoever it was , Ira had told her , deservedwhat he got . If Dennis and Laverne never managed to connect , why , that was their problem , not hers . But Maggie had gone on and on about it . " Safe , ' " she moaned . " Safep127in the house , ' he told me . Lord only knows what that poor Laverne is going through . " And she had spent the evening dialing all possible variations of their own number , every permutationof every digit , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cartwheel , Pennsylvania , was so close it could practically reach out and grab them , to hear her talk . " It 's on that cutoff right above the state line . I forget the name , " she was saying . " But I could n't see it anywhere on that map you got at the service station . " No wonder she 'd been so little help navigating ; she 'd been hunting Cartwheel instead . Traffic was surprisingly sparse for a Saturday . Mostly it was trucks  --  small , rusty trucks carrying logs or used tires , not the sleek monsters you 'd see on I-95 . They were traveling through farm country at this point , and each truck as it passed left another layer of dust on the wan , parched , yellowing fields that lined the road . " Here 's what we 'll do , " Maggie told him . " Stop by Fiona 's just for an instant . A teeny , eeny instant . Not accept even a glass of iced tea . Make her our offer and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ira said . " No , I could n't ! " " Telephone when we get back to Baltimore , if you 're so set on baby-sitting . " " That child is not but seven years old , " Maggie told him , " and she must just barely remember us . We ca n't take her on for a week just cold ! We have to let her get reacquainted first . " " How do you know it 's a week ? " Ira asked . She was riffling through her purse now . She said , " Hmm ? " " How do you know the honeymoon will last a week , Maggie ? " " Well , I do n't know . Maybe it 's two weeks . Maybe even a month , I do n't know . " He wondered , all at once , if this whole wedding was ap128myth  --  something she 'd invented for her own peculiar reasons . He would n't put it past her . " And besides ! " he said . " We could never stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not away : in Baltimore . We 'd take her back down to Baltimore . " " But then she 'd be missing school , " he said . " Oh , that 's no problem . We 'll let her go to school near us , " Maggie said . " Second grade is second grade , after all , the same all over . " Ira had so many different arguments against that that he was struck speechless . Now she dumped her purse upside down in her lap . " Oh , dear , " she said , studying her billfold , her lipstick , her comb , and her pack of Kleenex . " I wish I 'd brought that map from home . " It was another form of wastefulness , Ira thought , to search yet again through a purse whose contents she already knew byheart . Even Ira knew those contents by heart . And it was wasteful to continue caring about Fiona when Fiona obviously had no feeling for them , when she had made it very clear that she just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that , even ? " I just want to get on with my life "  --  it had a familiar ring . Maybe she had shouted it during that scene before she left , or maybe later during one of those pathetic visits they used to pay after the divorce , with Leroy bashful and strange and Mrs. Stuckey a single accusatory eye glaring around the edge of the living room door . Ira winced . Waste , waste , and more waste , all for nothing . The long drive and the forced conversation and the long drive home again , for absolutely nothing . And it was wasteful to devote your working life to people who forgot you the instant you left their bedsides , as Ira was forever pointing out . Oh , it was also admirably selfless , he supposed . But he did n't know how Maggie endured the im/permanence , the lack of permanent results  --  those feeble , senile patients who confused her with a long-dead mother or a sister who 'd insulted them back in 1928 . It was wasteful too to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer children anyhow  --  not even Daisy . ) Consider , for instance , the cigarette papers that Maggie had found last spring on Daisy 's bureau . She had picked them up while she was dusting and come running to Ira . " What 'll we do ? What are we going to do ? " she had wailed . " Our daughter 's smoking marijuana ; this is one of the telltale clues they mention in that pamphlet that the school gives out . " She 'd got Ira all involved and distressed ; that happened more often than he liked to admit . Together they had sat up far into the night , discussing ways of dealing with the problem . " Where did we go wrong ? " Maggie cried , and Ira hugged her and said , " There now , dear heart . I promise you we 'll see this thing through . " All for nothing yet again , it turned out . Turned out the cigarette papers were for Daisy 's flute . You slid them under the keys whenever they started sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take umbrage . Ira had felt ridiculous . He 'd felt he had spent something scarce and real  --  hard currency . Then he thought of how a thief had once stolen Maggie 's pocketbook , marched right into the kitchen where she was shelvinggroceries and stolen it off the counter as bold-faced as you please ; and she took after him . She could have been killed ! ( The efficient , the streamlined thing to do was to shrug and decide she was better off without that pocketbook  --  had never cared for it anyhow , and surely could spare the few limp dollars in the billfold . ) It was February and the sidewalks were sheets of glare ice , so running was impossible . Ira , returning from work , had been astonished to see a young boy shuffling toward him at a snail 's pace with Maggie 's red pocketbook dangling from his shoulder , and behind him Maggie herself came jogging alongp130inch by inch with her tongue between her teeth as she concentrated on her footing . The two of them had resembled those mimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . In fact , it had looked sort of comical , Ira reflected now . His lips twitched . He smiled . " What , " Maggie ordered . " You were crazy to go after that pocketbook thief , " he told her . " Honestly , Ira . How does your mind work ? " Exactly the question he might have asked her . " Anyhow , I did get it back , " she said . " Only by chance . What if he 'd been armed ? Or a little bigger ? What if he had n't panicked when he saw me ? " " You know , come to think of it , I believe I dreamed about that boy just a couple of nights ago , " Maggie said . " He was sitting in this kitchen that was kind of our kitchen and kind of not our kitchen , if you know what I mean .... " Ira wished she would n't keep telling her dreams . It made him feel fidgety and restless . Maybe if he had n't gotten married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was too great a price to pay ; even in his darkest moods he realized that . Well , if he had put his sister Dorrie in an institution , then  --  something state-run that would n't cost too much . And told his father , " I will no longer provide your support . Weak heart or not , take over this goddamn shop of yours and let me get on with my original plan if I can cast my mind back far enough to remember what it was . " And made his other sister venture into the world to find employment . " You think we 're not all scared ? " he would ask her . " But we go out anyway and earn our keep , and so will you . " But she would die of terror . He used to lie in bed at night when he was a little boy and pretend he was seeing patients . His drawn-up knees were his desk and he 'd look across his desk and ask , kindly , " What seems to be the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuredp131he might be an orthopedist , because bonesetting was so immediate . Like furniture repair , he had thought . He had imaginedthat the bone would make a clicking sound as it returned to its rightful place , and the patient 's pain would vanish utterly in that very instant . " Hoosegow , " Maggie said . " Pardon ? " She scooped up her belongings and poured them back in her purse . She set the purse on the floor at her feet . " The cutoff to Cartwheel , " she told him . " Was n't it something like Hoosegow ? " " I would n't have the faintest idea . " " Moose Cow . Moose Lump . " " I 'm not going there , whatever it 's called , " Ira told her . " Goose Bump . " " I would just like to remind you , " he said , " about those other visits . Remember how they turned out ? Leroy 's second birthday , when you phoned ahead to arrange things , telephoned , and still Fiona somehow forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we had to wait on the doorstep forever and finally turn around and come home . " Carrying Leroy 's gift , he did n't say : a gigantic , blankly smilingRaggedy Ann that broke his heart . " And her third birthday , when you brought her that kitten unannounced even though I warned you to check with Fiona beforehand , and Leroy started sneezing and Fiona said she could n't keep it . Leroy cried all afternoon , remember ? When we left , she was still crying . " " She could have taken shots for that , " Maggie said , stubbornlymissing the point . " Lots of children take allergy shots and they have whole housefuls of pets . " " Yes , but Fiona did n't want her to . She did n't want us interfering , and she really did n't want us visiting , either , which is why I said we should n't go there anymore . " Maggie cut her eyes over at him in a quick , surmising way.  |p132Probably  she was wondering if he knew about those other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if she had cared about keeping them secret you 'd think she would have filled the gas tank afterward . " What I 'm saying is  --  " he said . " I know what you 're saying ! " she cried . " You do n't have to keep hammering at it ! " He drove in silence for a while . A row of dotted lines stitched down the highway ahead of him . Dozens of tiny birds billowed up from a grove of trees and turned the blue sky cindery , and he watched them till they disappeared . " My Grandma Daley used to have a picture in her parlor , " Maggie said . " A little scene carved in something yellowish like ivory , or more likely celluloid . It showed this old couple sitting by the fireplace in their rocking chairs , and the title was etched across the bottom of the frame : Old Folks at Home . ' The woman was knitting and the man was reading an enormous book that you just knew was the Bible . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that was the whole idea , that the old folks were left at home while the childrenwent away . But they were so extremely old ! They had those withered-apple faces and potato-sack bodies ; they were people you would classify in an instant and dismiss . I never imagined that I would be an Old Folk at Home . " " You 're plotting to have that child come live with us , " Ira said . It hit him with a thump , as clearly as if she had spoken the words . " That 's what you 've been leading to . Now that you 're losing Daisy you 're plotting for Leroy to come and fill her place . " " I have no such intention ! " Maggie said  --  too quickly , it seemed to him . " Do n't think I do n't see through you , " he told her . " I suspectedall along there was something fishy about this baby-sitting business . You 're counting on Fiona to agree to it , now that she 's all caught up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shows how little you know , then , because I have no earthly intention of keeping Leroy for good . All I want to do is drop in on them this afternoon and make my offer , which might just incidentally cause Fiona to reconsider a bit about Jesse . " " Jesse ? " " Jesse our son , Ira . " " Yes , Maggie , I know Jesse 's our son , but I ca n't imagine what you think she could reconsider . They 're finished . She walked out on him . Her lawyer sent him those papers to sign and he signed them every one and sent them back . " " And has never , ever been the same since , " Maggie said . " He or Fiona , either . But anytime he makes a move to reconcile , she is passing through a stage where she wo n't speak to him , and then when she makes a move he has slammed off somewhere with hurt feelings and does n't know she 's trying . It 's like some awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mistake . " " Well ? So ? " Ira said . " I would think that ought to tell you something . " " Tell me what ? " " Tell you those two are a lost cause , Maggie . " " Oh , Ira , you just do n't give enough credit to luck , " Maggie said . " Good luck or bad luck , either one . Watch out for that car in front of you . " She meant the red Chevy  --  an outdated model , big as a barge , its finish worn down to the color of a dull red rubber eraser . Ira was already watching it . He did n't like the way it kept drifting from side to side and changing speeds . " Honk , " Maggie instructed him . Ira said , " Oh , I 'll just  --  " He would just get past the fellow , he was going to say . Some incompetent idiot ; best to put such people far behind you . He pressed the accelerator and checked the rearview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jab his horn . The long , insistent blare startled him . He seized Maggie 's hand and returnedit firmly to her lap . Only then did he realize that the Chevy driver , no doubt equally startled , had slowed sharply just feet ahead . Maggie made a grab for the dashboard . Ira had no choice ; he swerved right and plowed off the side of the road . Dust rose around them like smoke . The Chevy picked up speed and rounded a curve and vanished . " Jesus , " Ira said . Somehow their car had come to a stop , although he could n't recall braking . In fact , the engine had died . Ira was still gripping the wheel , and the keys were still swinging from the ignition , softly jingling against each other . " You just had to butt in , Maggie , did n't you , " he said . " Me ? You 're blaming this on me ? What did I do ? " " Oh , nothing . Only honked the horn when I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what last few wits he had . Just once in your life , Maggie , I wish you would manage not to stick your nose in what does n't concern you . " " And if I did n't , who would ? " she asked him . " And how can you say it does n't concern me when here I sit in what 's known far and wide as the death seat ? And also , it was n't my honking that caused the trouble ; it was that crazy driver , slowing down for no apparent reason . " Ira sighed . " Anyway , " he said . " Are you all right ? " " I could just strangle him ! " she said . He supposed that meant she was fine . He restarted the engine . It coughed a couple of times and then took hold . He checked for traffic and pulled out onto the highway again . After the gravelly roadside , the pavement felt too frictionless , too easy . He noticed how his hands were shaking on the steering wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Good thing we had our seat belts fastened . "  | " We ought to report him . " " Oh , well . So long as no one was hurt . " " Go faster , will you , Ira ? " He glanced over at her . " I want to get his license number , " she said . Her tangled curls gave her the look of a wild woman . Ira said , " Now , Maggie . When you think about it , it was really as much our doing as his . " " How can you say that ? When he was driving by fits and starts and wandering every which way ; have you forgotten ? " Where did she find the energy ? he wondered . How come she had so much to expend ? He was hot and his left shoulder ached where he 'd slammed against his seat belt . He shifted position , relieving the pressure of the belt across his chest . " You do n't want him causing a serious accident , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Probably he 's been drinking . Remember that public-service message on TV ? We have a civic duty to report him . Speed up , Ira . " He obeyed , mostly out of exhaustion . They passed an electrician 's van that had passed them earlier and then , as they crested a hill , they caught sight of the Chevy just ahead . It was whipping right along as if nothing had happened . Ira was surprised by a flash of anger . Damn fool driver . And who said it had to be a man ? More likely a woman , strewing chaos everywhere without a thought . He pressed harder on the accelerator . Maggie said , " Good , " and rolled down her window . " What are you doing ? " he asked . " Go faster . " " What did you open your window for ? " " Hurry , Ira ! We 're losing him . " " Be funny if we got a ticket for this , " Ira said . But he let the speedometer inch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chevy . Its rear window was so dusty that Ira had trouble seeing inside . All he could tell was that the driver wore a hat of some kind and sat very low in the seat . There did n't seem to be any passengers . The license plate was dusty too  --  a Pennsylvania plate , navy and yellow , the yellowmottled with gray as if mildewed . " Y two eight  --  " Ira read out . " Yes , yes , I have it , " Maggie said . ( She was the type who could still reel off her childhood telephone number . ) " Now let 's pass him , " she told Ira . " Oh , well .. " You see what kind of driver he is . I think we ought to pass . " Well , that made sense . Ira veered left . Just as they came alongside the Chevy , Maggie leaned out her window and pointed downward with her index finger . " Your wheel ! " she shouted . " Your wheel ! Your front wheel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He checked the mirror . Sure enough , the Chevy had slowed and was moving toward the shoulder . " Well , he believed you , " he said . He had to admit it was sort of a satisfaction . Maggie twisted around in her seat , gazing out the rear window . Then she turned to Ira . There was a stricken look on her face that he could n't account for . " Oh , Ira , " she said . " Now what . " " He was old , Ira . " Ira said , " These goddamn senior-citizen drivers ... " " Not only was he old , " she said . " He was black . " " So ? " " I did n't see him clearly till I 'd said that about the wheel , " she said . " He did n't mean to run us off the road ! I bet he does n't even know it happened . He had this wrinkled , dignified facep137and when I told him about the wheel his mouth dropped open but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hat ! His gray felt hat like my grandfather wore ! " Ira groaned . Maggie said , " Now he thinks we played a trick on him . He thinks we 're racist or something and lied about his wheel to be cruel . " " He does n't think any such thing , " Ira said . " As a matter of fact , he has no way of knowing his wheel is n't falling off . How would he check it ? He 'd have to watch it in motion . " " You mean he 's still sitting there ? " " No , no , " Ira said hastily . " I mean he 's probably back on the road by now but he 's traveling a little slower , just to make sure it 's all right . " " I would n't do that , " Maggie said . " Well , you 're not him . " " He would n't do that , either . He 's old and confused and alone and he 's sitting there in his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Lord , " Ira said . " We have to go back and tell him . " Somehow , he 'd known that was coming . " We wo n't say we deliberately lied , " Maggie said . " We 'll tell him we just were n't sure . We 'll ask him to make a test drive while we watch , and then we 'll say , Oops ! Our mistake . Your wheel is fine ; we must have misjudged . ' " " Where 'd you get this we ' business ? " Ira asked . " I never told him it was loose in the first place . " " Ira , I 'm begging you on bended knee , please turn around and go rescue that man . " " It is now one-thirty in the afternoon , " Ira said . " With luck we could be home by three . Maybe even two-thirty . I could open the shop for a couple of hours , which may not be much but it 's better than nothing . "  | " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him not knowing what to do , " Maggie said . " He 's still hanging on to the steering wheel . I can see him as plain as day . So could Ira . He slowed as they came to a large , prosperous-looking farm . A grassy lane led toward the barn , and he veered onto that without signaling first , in order to make the turn seem more sudden and more exasperated . Maggie 's sunglasses scooted the length of the dashboard . Ira backed up , waited for a stream of traffic that all at once materialized , and then spun out onto Route One again , this time heading north . Maggie said , " I knew you could n't be heartless . " " Just imagine , " Ira told her . " All up and down this highway , other couples are taking weekend drives together . They 're travelingfrom Point A to Point B. They 're holding civilized discussionsabout , I do n't know , current events . Disarmament . Apartheid . " " He probably thinks we belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started chewing her lip the way she always did when she was worried . " No stops , no detours , " Ira said . " If they take any break at all , it 's for lunch in some classy old inn . Someplace they researchedahead of time , where they even made reservations . " He was starving , come to think of it . He had n't eaten a thing at Serena 's . " It was right about here , " Maggie said , perking up . " I recognizethose silos . It was just before those mesh-looking silos . There he is . " Yes , there he was , not sitting in his car after all but walking around it in a wavery circle  --  a stoop-shouldered man the color of a rolltop desk , wearing one of those elderly suits than seem longer in front than in back . He was studying the tires of the Chevy , which might have been abandoned years ago ; it had ap139settled , resigned appearance . Ira signaled and made a U-turn , arriving neatly behind so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and stepped out . " Can we help ? " he called . Maggie got out too but seemed willing for once to let Ira do the talking . " It 's my wheel , " the old man said . " Lady back up the road a ways pointed out my wheel was falling off . " " That was us , " Ira told him . " Or my wife , at least . But you know , I believe she might have been wrong . That wheel seems fine to me . " The old man looked at him directly now . He had a skulllike , deeply lined face , and the whites of his eyes were so yellow they were almost brown . " Oh , well , surely , seems fine , " he said . " When the car is setting stark still like it is . " " But I mean even before , " Ira told him . " Back when you were still on the road . " The old man appeared unconvinced . He prodded the tire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Mighty nice of you folks to stop . " Maggie said , " Nice ! It 's the least we could do . " She stepped forward . " I 'm Maggie Moran , " she said . " This is my husband , Ira . " My name 's Mr. Daniel Otis , " the old man said , touching the brim of his hat . " Mr. Otis , see , I had this sort of , like , mirage as we were driving past your car , " Maggie said . " I thought I noticed your wheel wobbling . But then the very next instant I said , No , I believe I imagined it . ' Did n't I , Ira ? Just ask Ira . ' I believe I made that driver stop for no good reason , ' I told him . " " They 's all kindly explanations why you might have seen it wobble , " Mr. Otis said . " Why , certainly ! " Maggie cried . " Heat waves , maybe , ripplingabove the pavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Might have been a sign , too , " Mr. Otis said.  | " Sign ? " " Might have been the Lord was trying to warn me . " " Warn you about what ? " " Warn me my left front wheel was fixing to drop off . " Maggie said , " Well , but  --  " " Mr. Otis , " Ira said . " I think it 's more likely my wife just made a mistake . " " Now , you ca n't know that . " " An understandable mistake , " Ira said , " but all the same , a mistake . So what we ought to do is , you get into your car and drive it just a few yards down the shoulder . Maggie and I will watch . If your wheel 's not loose , you 're free and clear . If it is , we 'll take you to a service station . " " Oh , why , I appreciate that , " Mr. Otis said . " Maybe Buford , if it ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buford Texaco . It 's up ahead a piece ; my nephew works there . " " Sure , anywhere , " Ira said , " but I 'm willing to bet  --  " " In fact , if it ai n't too much trouble you might just go on and carry me there right now , " Mr. Otis said . " Now ? " " I do n't relish driving a car with a wheel about to drop off . " " Mr. Otis , " Ira said . " We 'll test the wheel . That 's what I 've been telling you . " " I 'll test it , " Maggie said . " Yes , Maggie will test it . Maggie ? Honey , maybe I should be the one . " " Shoot , yes ; it 's way too risky for a lady , " Mr. Otis told her . Ira had been thinking of the risk to the Chevy , but he said , " Right . You and Mr. Otis watch ; I 'll drive . " " No , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Otis said . " I appreciate it , but I ca n't allow it . Too much danger . You folks just carry me to the Texaco , please , and my nephew will come fetch the car with the tow truck . "  |p141Ira  looked at Maggie . Maggie looked back at him helplessly . The sounds of traffic whizzing past reminded him of those TV thrillers where spies rendezvoused in modern wastelands , on the edges of superhighways or roaring industrial complexes . " Listen , " Ira said . " I 'll just come right out with this  --  " " Or do n't carry me ! Do n't , " Mr. Otis cried . " I already inconveniencedyou-all enough , I know that . " " The fact is , we feel responsible , " Ira told him . " What we said about your wheel was n't so much a mistake as a plain and simple , urn , exaggeration . " " Yes , we made it up , " Maggie said . " Aw , no , " Mr. Otis said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from worrying . " " A while back you kind of , like , more or less , slowed downtoo suddenly in front of us , " Maggie said , " and caused us torun off the road . Not intending to , I realize , but  --  " " I did that ? " " Not intending to , " Maggie assured him . " And besides , " Ira said , " you probably slowed because we accidentally honked . So it 's not as if  --  " " Oh , I declare . Florence , that 's my niece , she is all the time after me to turn in my driver 's license , but I surely never expected  --  " " Anyhow , I did a very inconsiderate thing , " Maggie told him . " I said your wheel was falling off when really it was fine . " " Why , I call that a very Christian thing , " Mr. Otis said . " When I had caused you to run off the road ! You folks been awful nice about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  " " Many would 've let me ride on to my death , " Mr. Otis said . " The wheel was fine ! " Maggie told him . " It was n't wobbling in the slightest . " Mr. Otis tipped his head back and studied her . His lowered eyelids gave him such a haughty , hooded expression that it seemed he might finally have grasped her meaning . But thenp142he said , " Naw , that ca n't be right . Can it ? Naw . I tell you : Now that I recollect , that car was driving funny all this morning . I knew it and yet did n't know it , you know ? And I reckon it must 've hit you-all the same way  --  kindly like you half glimpsed it out of the corner of your vision so you were moved to say what you did , not understanding just why . " That settled it ; Ira took action . " Well , then , " he said , " nothing to do but test it . Keys inside ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and slid in . " Aw , now ! " Mr. Otis cried . " Do n't you go risking your neck for me , mister ! " " He 'll be all right , " Maggie told him . Ira gave Mr. Otis a reassuring wave . Even though the window was open , the Chevy was pulsing with heat . The clear plastic seat cover seemed to have partially melted , and there was a strong smell of overripe banana . No wonder : The remains of a bag lunch sat on the passenger seata crumpled sack , a banana peel , and a screw of cellophane . Ira turned the key in the ignition . When the engine roared up he leaned out toward Maggie and Mr. Otis and said , " Watch carefully . " They said nothing . For two people who looked so little alike , they wore oddly similar expressions : wary and guarded , as if braced for the worst . Ira put the car in gear and started rolling along the shoulder . He felt he was driving something that stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance . Also , there was a rattle in the exhaust system . After a few yards , he braked and cocked his head out the window . The others had not moved from where they stood ; they 'd merely turned their faces in his direction . " Well ? " he called . There was a pause . Then Mr. Otis said , " Yessir , seem like I did see a bit of a jiggling motion to it . "  | " You did ? " Ira asked . He quirked an eyebrow at Maggie . " But you did n't , " he said . " Well , I 'm not certain , " Maggie told him . " Excuse me ? " " Maybe I just imagined it , " she said , " but I thought there was a little , sort of , I do n't know ... " Ira shifted gears and backed up with a jolt . When he was alongside them once more he said , " Now I want you both to watch very , very closely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . They were forced to follow him . He glanced in the side-view mirror and saw Maggie scurrying along with her arms folded beneath her bosom . He stopped the car and climbed out to face them . " Oh , that wheel is loose , all right , " Mr. Otis called as he arrived . Ira said , " Maggie ? " " It reminded me of a top , just before it stops spinning and falls over , " Maggie said . " Now listen here , Maggie  --  " " I know ! I know ! " she said . " But I ca n't help it , Ira ; I really saw it wobble . And also it looked kind of squashy . " " Well , that 's a whole different problem , " Ira said . " The tire may be underinflated . But that wheel is on tight as a drum , I swear it . I could feel it . I ca n't believe you 're doing this , Maggie . " " Well , I 'm sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't see what I saw with my own two eyes . I just think we 're going to have to take him to that Texaco . " Ira looked at Mr. Otis . " You got a lug wrench ? " he asked . " A . . . sir ? " " If you 've got a lug wrench , I could tighten that wheel myself . " " Oh , why . . . Is a lug wrench like a ordinary wrench ? "  | " You probably have one in your trunk , " Ira told him , " where you keep your jack . " " Oh ! But where do I keep my jack , I wonder , " Mr. Otis said . " In your trunk , " Ira repeated doggedly , and he reached inside the car for the keys and handed them over . He was keeping his face as impassive as possible , but inwardly he felt the way he felt anytime he stopped by Maggie 's nursing home : utterly despairing . He could n't see how this Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along as he did . " Lug wrench , lug wrench , " Mr. Otis was murmuring . He unlocked the trunk and flung the lid up . " Now let me just ... " At first glance , the trunk 's interior seemed a solid block of fabric . Blankets , clothes , and pillows had been packed inside so tightly that they had congealed together . " Oh , me , " Mr. Otis said , and he plucked at a corner of a graying quilt , which did n't budge . " Never mind , " Ira told him . " 1 ' 11 get mine . " He walked back to the Dodge . It suddenly seemed very well kept , if you overlooked what Maggie had done to the left front fender . He took his keys from the ignition and unlocked the trunk and opened it . Nothing . Where once there 'd been a spare tire , tucked into the well beneath the floor mat , now there was an empty space . And not a sign of the gray vinyl pouch in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She turned lazily from her position by the Chevy and tilted her head in his direction . " What happened to my spare tire ? " he asked . " It 's on the car . " " On the car ? " She nodded vigorously . " You mean it 's in use ? "  | " Right . " " Then where 's the original tire ? " " It 's getting patched at the Exxon back home . " " Well , how did . . . ? " No , never mind ; better not get sidetracked . " So where are the tools , then ? " he called . " What tools ? " He slammed the lid down and walked back to the Chevy . There was no point shouting ; he could see his lug wrench was not going to be anywhere within reach . " The tools you changed the tire with , " he told her . " Oh , I did n't change the tire . A man stopped and helped me . " Did he use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . " " Did he put them back ? " " Well , he must have , " Maggie said . She frowned , evidently trying to recall . " They 're not there , Maggie . " " Well , I 'm sure he did n't steal them , if that 's what you 're thinking . He was a very nice man . He would n't even accept any money ; he said he had a wife of his own and  --  " " I 'm not saying he stole them ; I 'm just asking where they are . Maggie said , " Maybe on the . . . " and then mumbled something further , he was n't sure what . " Pardon ? " " I said , maybe on the corner of Charles Street and Northern Parkway ! " she shouted . Ira turned to Mr. Otis . The old man was watching him withhis eyes half closed ; he appeared to be falling asleep on his feet . " I guess we 'll have to unpack your trunk , " Ira told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to begin . " Shall we just unload it ? " Ira asked  | " Well , we could do that , " Mr. Otis said doubtfully . There was a pause . Ira said , " Well ? Shall we start ? " " We could start if you like , " Mr. Otis told him , " but I 'd bevery much surprised if we was to find a wheel wrench . " " Everybody has a wheel wrench . Lug wrench , " Ira said . " Itcomes with the car . " " I never saw it . " " Oh , Ira , " Maggie said . " Ca n't we just drive him to the Texaco and get his nephew to fix it properly ? " " And how do you think he would do that , Maggie ? He 'd take a wrench and tighten the lug nuts , not that they need it . " Mr. Otis , meanwhile , had managed to remove a single item from the trunk : a pair of flannel pajama bottoms . He held them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face , or maybe it was the pajamas themselves  --  crinkled and withered , trailing a frazzled drawstring  --  but at any rate , Ira all at once gave in . " Oh , what the hell , " he said . " Let 's just go to the Texaco . " " Thank you , Ira , " Maggie told him sweetly . And Mr. Otis said , " Well , if you sure it ai n't too much trouble . " " No , no . . . " Ira passed a hand across his forehead . " So I guess we 'd better lock up the Chevy , " he said . Maggie said , " What Chevy ? " " That 's what kind of car this is , Maggie . " " Ai n't hardly no point locking it with a wheel about to fly off , " Mr. Otis said . Ira had a brief moment when he wondered if this whole situation might be Mr. Otis 's particularly passive , devilish way of getting even . He turned and walked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trunk lid clanging shut and the sound of their feet on the gravel , but he did n't wait for them to catch up.  |p147Now  the Dodge was as hot as the Chevy , and the chrome shaft of the gearshift burned his fingers . He sat there with the motor idling while Maggie helped Mr. Otis settle in the back seat . She seemed to know by instinct that he would require assistance ; he had to be folded across the middle in some complicatedfashion . The last of him to enter was his feet , which he gathered to him by lifting both knees with his hands . Then he let out a sigh and took his hat off . In the mirror Ira saw a bony , plated-looking scalp , with two cottony puffs of white hair snarling above his ears . " I surely do appreciate this , " Mr. Otis said . " Oh , no trouble ! " Maggie told him , flouncing onto the front seat . Speak for yourself , Ira thought sourly . He waited for a cavalcade of motorcyclists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long S-curves , as free as birds ) , and then he pulled onto the highway . " So whereabouts are we headed ? " he asked . " Oh , why , you just drive on past the dairy farm and make a right , " Mr. Otis told him . " It ai n't but three , four miles . " Maggie craned around in her seat and said , " You must live in this area . " " Back-air a ways on Dead Crow Road , " Mr. Otis told her . " Or used to , till last week . Lately I been staying with my sister Lurene . " Then he started telling her about his sister Lurene , who worked off and on at the K Mart when her arthritis was n't too bad ; and that of course led to a discussion of Mr. Otis 's own arthritis , the sneaky slow manner it had crept up on him and the other things he had thought it was first and how the doctor had marveled and made over his condition when Mr. Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had seen what I have seen , " Maggie said . " Peoplein the nursing home where I work just knotted over ; don'tp148I know it . " She had a tendency to fall into other people 's rhythms of speech while she was talking to them . Close your eyes and you could almost fancy she was black herself , Ira thought . " It 's a evil , mean-spirited ailment ; no two ways about it , " Mr. Otis said . " This here is the dairy farm , mister . You want to take your next right . " Ira slowed down . They passed a small clump of cows moonilychomping and staring , and then they turned onto a road not two full lanes wide . The pavement was patchy , with handpaintedsigns tilting off the grassy embankment : DANGER LIVESTOCKMAY BE LOOSE and SLOW THIS MEANS YOU and HOUNDS AND HORSES CROSSING . Now Mr. Otis was explaining how arthritis had forced him to retire . He used to be a roofer , he said , down home in North Carolina . He used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't manage the lowest rung of a ladder . Maggie made a clucking sound . Ira wondered why Maggie always had to be inviting other people into their lives . She did n't feel a mere husband was enough , he suspected . Two was not a satisfactory number for her . He remembered all the strays she had welcomed over the years  --  her brother who spent a winter on their couch when his wife fell in love with her dentist , and Serena that time that Max was in Virginia hunting work , and of course Fiona with her baby and her mountains of baby equipment , her stroller and her playpen and her wind-up infant swing . In his present mood , Ira thought he might include their own children as well , for were n't Jesse and Daisy also outsiders  --  interrupting their most private moments , wedging between the two of them ? ( Hard to believe that some people had children to hold a marriage together . ) And neither one had been planned for , at least not quite so soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had hopes of going back to school . It was supposed to be the next thing in line , after paying off his sister 's medical bills and hisp149father 's new furnace . Maggie would keep on working full time . But then she found out she was pregnant , and she had to take leave from her job . And after that Ira 's sister developed a whole new symptom , some kind of seizures that required hospitalization ; and a moving van crashed into the shop one Christmas Eve and damaged the building . Then Maggie got pregnant with Daisy , another surprise . ( Had it been unwise , perhaps , to leave matters of contraception to someone so accident-prone ? ) But that was eight years after Jesse , and Ira had more or less abandonedhis plans by then anyhow . Sometimes  --  on a day like today , say , this long , hot day in this dusty car  --  he experienced the most crushing kind of tiredness . It was an actual weight on his head , as if the ceiling had been lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and again . Maggie was telling Mr. Otis the purpose of their trip . " My oldest , closest friend just lost her husband , " she was saying , " and we had to go to his funeral . It was the saddest occasion . " " Oh , gracious . Well , now , I want to offer my sincere condolences , " Mr. Otis said . Ira slowed behind a round-shouldered , humble-looking car from the forties , driven by an old lady so hunched that her head was barely visible above the steering wheel . Route One , the nursing home of highways . Then he remembered that this was n't Route One anymore , that they had drifted sideward or maybe even backward , and he had a dreamy , floating sensation . It was like that old spell during a change of seasons when you momentarily forget what stage the year is going through . Is it spring , or is it fall ? Is the summer just beginning , or is it coming to an end ? They passed a modern , split-level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch boy and girl bobbing delicately toward each other so their lips were almost touching . Then a trailer park and assorted signs for churches , civic organizations ,  |p150Al  's Lawn and Patio Furnishings . Mr. Otis sat forward with a grunt , clutching the back of the seat . " Right up-air is the Texaco , " he said . " See it ? " Ira saw it : a small white rectangle set very close to the road . Mylar balloons hovered high above the pumps  --  three to each pump , red , silver , and blue , twining lazily about one another . He turned onto the concrete apron , carefully avoiding the signal cord that stretched across it , and braked and looked back at Mr. Otis . But Mr. Otis stayed where he was ; it was Maggie who got out . She opened the rear door and set a hand beneath the old man 's elbow while he uncurled himself . " Now , just where is your nephew ? " she asked . Mr. Otis said , " Somewheres about . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not working today ? " " Why , he must be working . Ai n't he ? " Oh , Lord , they were going to prolong this situation forever . Ira cut the engine and watched the two of them walking across the apron . Over by the full-service island , a white boy with a stringy brown ponytail listened to what they asked and then shook his head . He said something , waving an arm vaguely eastward . Ira groaned and slid down lower in his seat . Then here came Maggie , clicking along , and Ira took heart ; but when she reached the car all she did was lean in through the passenger window . " We have to wait a minute , " she told him . " What for ? " " His nephew 's out on a call but he 's expected back in no time . " " Then why ca n't we just leave ? " Ira asked . " I could n't do that ! I would n't rest easy . I would n't know how it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came out ? His wheel is perfectly fine , remember ? "  | " It wobbled , Ira . I saw it wobble . " He sighed . " And maybe his nephew wo n't show up for some reason , " she said , " so Mr. Otis will be stranded here . Or maybe it will cost money . I want to make sure he 's not out any money . " " Look here , Maggie  --  " " Why do n't you fill the tank ? Surely we could use some gas . " We do n't have a Texaco credit card , " he told her . " Pay cash . Fill the tank and by then I bet Lamont will be pulling into the station . " " Lamont , " already . Next thing you knew , she 'd have adopted the boy . He restarted the engine , muttering , and drew up next to the self-serve island and got out . They had an older style of pump here that Baltimore no longer used  --  printed flip-over numerals instead of LED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ira had to readjust , cast his mind back a couple of years in order to get the thing going . Then while the gas flowed into the tank he watched Maggie settle Mr. Otis on a low , whitewashedwall that separated the Texaco from someone 's vegetable garden . Mr. Otis had his hat back on and he was hunkered under it like a cat under a table , peering forth reflectively , chewing on a mouthful of air , as old men were known to do . He was ancient , and yet probably not so many years older than Ira himself . It was a thought to give you pause . Ira heard the jolt as the gas cut off , and he turned back to the car . Overhead , the balloons rustled against each other with a sound that made him think of raincoats . While he was paying inside the station he noticed a snack machine , so he walked over to the others to see if they wanted something . They were deep in conversation , Mr. Otis going on and on about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato chips , " Ira said . " The kind you like : barbecue. "  |p152Maggie  waved a hand at him . " I think you were absolutely justified , " she told Mr. Otis . " And bacon rinds ! " Ira said . " You hardly ever find bacon rinds these days . " She gave him a distant , abstracted look and said , " Have you forgotten I 'm on a diet ? " " How about you , then , Mr. Otis ? " " Oh , why , no , thank you , sir ; thank you kindly , sir , " Mr. Otis said . He turned to Maggie and went on : " So anyways , I axes her , Duluth , how can you hold me to count for that , woman ? ' " " Mr. Otis 's wife is mad at him for something he did in her dream , " Maggie told Ira . Mr. Otis said , " Here I am just as unaware as a babe and I come down into the kitchen , I axes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . ' I say , Huh ? ' " " That is just so unfair , " Maggie told him . Ira said , " Well , I believe I 'll have a snack , " and he walked back toward the station , hands stuffed into his pockets , feeling left out . Dieting too , he thought ; dieting was another example of Maggie 's wastefulness . The water diet and the protein diet and the grapefruit diet . Depriving herself meal after meal when in Ira 's opinion she was just exactly right as she was  --  not even what you 'd call plump ; just a satisfying series of handfuls , soft , silky breasts and a creamy swell of bottom . But since when had she ever listened to Ira ? He dropped coins glumly into the snack machine and punched the key beneath a sack of pretzels . When he got back , Maggie was saying , " I mean think if we all did that ! Mistook our dreams for real life . Look at me : Two or three times a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing . This totally bland neighbor named Mr. Simmons who looks like a salesman of something , I do n't know , insurance or real estate or something . In the daytime I do n't give him ap153thought , but at night I dream we 're kissing and I long for him to unbutton my blouse , and in the morning at the bus stop I 'm so embarrassed I ca n't even meet his eyes but then I see he 's just the same as ever , bland-faced man in a business suit . " " For God 's sake , Maggie , " Ira said . He tried to picture this Simmons character , but he had no idea who she could be talking about . " I mean what if I was held to blame for that ? " Maggie asked . " Some thirty-year-old . . . kid I do n't have the faintest interest in ! I 'm not the one who designed that dream ! " " No , indeed , " Mr. Otis said . " And anyways , this here of Duluth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dreamed it . She claim I was standing on her needlepoint chair , her chair seat she worked forever on , so she order me off but when I stepped down I was walking on her crocheted shawl and her embroidered petticoat , my shoes was dragging lace and ruffles and bits of ribbon . If that ai n't just like you , ' she tell me in the morning , and I say , What did I do ? Show me what I did . Show me where I ever trompled on a one of them things . ' She say , You are just a mowing-down type of man , Daniel Otis , and if I knew I 'd have to put up with you so long I 'd have made a more thoughtful selection when I married . ' So I say , Well , if that 's how you feel , I 'm leaving , ' and she say , Do n't forget your things , ' and off I go . " " Mr. Otis has been living in his car these last few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that right , " Ira said . " So it matters quite a heap to me that my wheel not pop off , " Mr. Otis added . Ira sighed and sat down on the wall next to Maggie . The pretzels were the varnished kind that stuck in his teeth , but he was so hungry that he went on eating them . Now the ponytailed boy walked toward them , so direct and purposeful in his tap-heeled leather boots that Ira stood up again ,  |p154imagining  they had some business to discuss . But all the boy did was coil the air hose that had been hissing on the concrete all this time without their noticing . In order not to look indecisive , Ira went on over to him anyhow . " So ! " he said . " What 's the story on this Lamont ? " " He 's out , " the boy told him . " No chance we could get you to come , I guess . Run you over to the highway in our car and get you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nope , " the boy said , hanging the hose on its hook . Ira said , " I see . " He returned to the wall , and the boy walked back to the station . " I think it might be Moose Run , " Maggie was telling Mr. Otis . " Is that the name ? This cutoff that leads into Cartwheel . " " Now , I do n't know about no Moose Run , " Mr. Otis said , " but I have heard tell of Cartwheel . Just ca n't say right off exactly how you 'd get there . See , they 's so many places hereabouts that sound like towns , call theyselves towns , but really they ai n't much more than a grocery store and a gas pump . " " That 's Cartwheel , all right , " Maggie said . " One main street . No traffic lights . Fiona lives on a skinny little road that does n't even have a sidewalk . Fiona 's our daughter-in-law . Exdaughter-in-law , I suppose I should say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now they 're divorced . " " Yes , that is how they do nowadays , " Mr. Otis said . " Lamontis divorced too , and my sister Florence ' girl Sally . I do n't know why they bother getting married . " Just as if his own marriage were in perfect health . " Have a pretzel , " Ira said . Mr. Otis shook his head absently but Maggie dug down deep in the bag and came up with half a dozen . " Really it was all a misunderstanding , " she told Mr. Otis . She bit into a pretzel . " They were perfect for each other . Theyp155even looked perfect : Jesse so dark and Fiona so blond . It 's just that Jesse was working musician 's hours and his life was sort of , I do n't know , unsteady . And Fiona was so young , and inclined to fly off the handle . Oh , I used to just ache for them . It broke Jesse 's heart when she left him ; she took their little daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart was broken too , I know , but do you think she would say so ? And now they 're so neatly divorced you would think they had never been married . " All true , as far as it went , Ira reflected ; but there was a lot she 'd left out . Or not left out so much as slicked over , somehow , like that image of their son  --  the " musician " plying his trade so busily that he was forced to neglect his " wife " and his " daughter . " Ira had never thought of Jesse as a musician ; he 'd thought of him as a high-school dropout in need of permanent employment . And he had never thought of Fiona as a wife but rather as Jesse 's teenaged sidekick  --  her veil of gleaming blond hair incongruous above a skimpy T-shirt and tight jeans  --  while poor little Leroy had not been much more than their pet , their stuffed animal won at a carnival booth . He had a vivid memory of Jesse as he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sixteen . He 'd been picked up for public drunkenness with several of his friends  --  a onetime occurrence , as it turned out , but Ira had wanted to make sure of that and so , intending to be hard on him , he had insisted Maggie stay home while he went down alone to post bail . He had sat on a bench in a public waiting area and finally there came Jesse , walking doubled over between two officers . Evidentlyhis wrists had been handcuffed behind his back and he had attempted , at some point , to step through the circle of his own arms so as to bring his hands in front of him . But he had given up or been interrupted halfway through the maneuver , and so he hobbled out lopsided , twisted like a sideshow freak with his wrists trapped between his legs . Ira had experiencedp156the most complicated mingling of emotions at the sight : anger at his son and anger at the authorities too , for exhibiting Jesse 's humiliation , and a wild impulse to laugh and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been pushed up his forearms in the modern style ( something boys never did in Ira 's day ) and that had made him seem even more vulnerable , and so had his expression , once he was unlocked and could stand upright , although it was a fiercely defiant expression and he would n't acknowledge Ira 's presence . Now when Ira thought of Jesse he always pictured him as he 'd been that night , that same combination of infuriating and pathetic . He wondered how Maggie pictured him . Maybe she delved even farther into the past . Maybe she saw him at age four or age six , a handsome , uncommonly engaging little kid with no more than the average kid 's problems . At any rate , she surely did n't view him as he really was . No , nor their daughter , either , he thought . Maggie saw Daisy as a version of Maggie 's mother  --  accomplished , efficient  --  andshe fluttered around her , looking inadequate . She had fluttered ever since Daisy was a little girl with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her homework . But Daisy was pitiable too , in her way . Ira saw that clearly , even though she was the one he felt closer to . She seemed to be missing out on her own youth  --  had never even had a boyfriend , so far as Ira could tell . Whenever Jesse got into mischief as a child Daisy had taken on a pinch-faced expression of disapproval , but Ira would almost rather she had joined in the mischief herself . Was n't that how it was supposed to work ? Was n't that how it worked in other families , those jolly , noisy families Ira used to watch wistfully when he was a little boy ? Now she was packed for college  --  had been packed for weeks  --  and had no clothes left but the throwaways that she was n't taking with her ; and she walked around the house looking bleak and joyless as a nun in her limp , frayed blouses and fadedp157skirts . But Maggie thought she was admirable . " When I was her age I had n't even begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daisy wanted to be a quantum physicist . " I 'm just so impressed with that , " Maggie said , till Ira said , " Maggie , just what is a quantum physicist ? "  --  honestly wanting to know . " Do you have the foggiest inkling ? " he asked . Then Maggie thought he was belittling her and she said , " Oh , I admit I 'm not scientific ! I never said I was scientific ! I 'm just a geriatric nursing assistant , I admit it ! " and Ira said , " All I meant was  --  Jesus ! All I meant was  --  " and Daisy poked her head in the door and said , " Would you please , please not have another one of your blowups ; I 'm trying to read . " " Blowup ! " Maggie cried . " I make the simplest little re-mark  --  " And Ira told Daisy , " Listen here , miss , if you 're so easily disturbed as all that , you can just go read in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Maggiehad buried her head in her hands . " Same old song and dance "  --  that was how Jesse had once referred to marriage . This was one morning when Fiona had left the breakfast table in tears , and Ira had asked Jesse what was wrong . " You know how it is , " Jesse had answered . " Same old song and dance as always . " Then Ira ( who had asked not out of empty curiosity but as a means of implying This matters , son ; pay her some heed ) had wondered what that " you know " signified . Was Jesse saying that Ira 's marriage and his own had anything in common ? Because if so , he was way out of line . They were two entirely different institutions . Ira 's marriage was as steady as a tree ; not even he could tell how wide and deep the roots went . Still , Jesse 's phrase had stuck in his memory : same old song and dance . Same old arguments , same recriminations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty and gestures of support and consolations no one else knew howp158to offer ; but also the same old resentments dragged up year after year , with nothing ever totally forgotten : the time Ira did n't act happy to hear Maggie was pregnant , the time Maggie failed to defend Ira in front of her mother , the time Ira refused to visit Maggie in the hospital , the time Maggie forgot to invite Ira 's family to Christmas dinner . And the unvaryingness  --  ah , Lord ; who could blame Jesse for chafing against that ? Probably the boy had been watching his parents sideways all the years of his childhood , swearing he would never put up with such.a life : plugging along day after day , Ira heading to his shop every morning , Maggie to the nursing home . Probably those afternoons that Jesse had spent helping out at the shop had been a kind of object lesson . He must have recoiled from it  --  Ira sitting endlessly on his high wooden stool , whistling along with his easy-listening radio stationas he measured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in asking him to frame their cross-stitched homiliesand their amateur seascapes and their wedding photos ( two serious people in profile gazing solely at each other ) . They brought in illustrations torn from magazines  --  a litter of puppies or a duckling in a basket . Like a tailor measuring a half-dressed client , Ira remained discreetly sightless , appearing to form no judgment about a picture of a sad-faced kitten tangled in a ball of yarn . " He wants a pastel-colored mat of some kind , would n't you say ? " the women might ask . ( They often used personal pronouns , as if the pictures were animate . ) " Yes , ma'am , " Ira would answer . " Maybe a pale blue that would pick up the blue of his ribbon . " " Yes , we could do that . " And through Jesse 's eyes he would see himself all at once as a generic figure called The Shopkeeper : a drab and obsequious man of indeterminate age . Above the shop he could usually hear the creak , pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hesitant footsteps of one of his sisters crossing the living room floor . Their voices , of course , were n't audible , and for this reason Ira had fallen into the habit of imagining that his family never spoke during the day  --  that they were keeping very still till Ira came . He was the backbone of their lives ; he knew that . They depended on him utterly . In his childhood he had been extraneous  --  a kind of afterthought , half a generation younger than his sisters . He had been so much the baby that he 'd called every family member " honey , " because that was how all those grownups or almostgrownupsaddressed him and he 'd assumed it was a universal term . " I need my shoes tied , honey , " he would tell his father . He did n't have the usual baby 's privileges , though ; he was never the center of attention . If any of them could be said to occupy that position it was his sister Dorrie  --  mentally handicapped , frail and jerky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected air and tended to sit by herself on the outskirts - of a room . Their mother suffered from a progressive disease that killed her when Ira was fourteen , that left him forever afterward edgy and frightened in the presence of illness ; and anyhow she had never shown much of a talent for mothering . She devoted herself instead to religion , to radio evangelists and inspirational pamphlets left by door-to-door missionaries . Her idea of a meal was saltines and tea , for all of them . She never got hungry like ordinary mortals or realized that others could be hungry , but simply took in sustenance when the clock reminded her . If they wanted real food it was up to their father , for Dorrie was not capable of anything complicated and Junie was subject to some kind of phobia that worsened over the years till she refused to leave the house for so much as a quart of milk . Their father had to see to that when he was finished down at the shop . He would trudge upstairs for the grocery list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans , and putter around the kitchen withp160the girls . Even after Ira was old enough , his assistance was not required . He was the interloper , the one rude splash of color in a sepia photograph . His family gave him a wide berth while addressing him remotely and kindly . " You finish your homework , honey ? " they would ask , and they asked this even in the summer and over the Christmas holidays . Then Ira graduated  --  had already paid his deposit at the University of Maryland , with dreams of going on to medical school  --  and his father suddenly abdicated . He just . . . imploded , was how Ira saw it . Declared he had a weak heart and could not continue . Sat down in his platform rocker and stayed there . Ira took over the business , which was n't easy because he 'd never played the smallest part in it up till then . All at once he was the one his family turned to . They relied on him for money and errands and advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . It was , " Honey , is this dress out of style ? " and , " Honey , can we afford a new rug ? " In a way , Ira felt gratified , especially at the beginning , when this seemed to be just a temporary , summer-vacation state of affairs . He was no longer on the sidelines ; he was central . He rooted through Dorrie 's bureau drawers for the mate to her favorite red sock ; he barbered Junie 's graying hair ; he dumped the month 's receipts into his father 's lap , all in the knowledge that he , Ira , was the only one they could turn to . But summer stretched into fall , and first the university granted him a semester 's postponement and then a year 's postponement , and then after a while the subject no longer cameup . Well , face it , there were worse careers than cutting fortyfive-degreeangles in strips of gilded molding . And he did have Maggie , eventually  --  dropping into his lap like a wonderful gift out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe his life was n't exactly what he had pictured when he was eighteen , but whose was ? That was how things worked , most often.  |p161Although  he knew that Jesse did n't see it that way . No compromises for Jesse Moran , no , sir . No modifications , no lowering of sights for Jesse . " I refuse to believe that I will die unknown , " he had said to Ira once , and Ira , instead of smiling tolerantly as he should have , had felt slapped in the face . Unknown . Maggie said , " Ira , did you happen to notice a soft-drink machine inside the station ? " He looked at her . " Ira ? " He pulled himself together and said , " Why , yes , I think so . " With diet soft drinks ? " " Um " I 'll go check , " Maggie said . " Those pretzels made me thirsty . Mr. Otis ? Want something to drink ? " " Oh , no , I 'm doing all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , her skirt swinging . Both men watched her go . " A fine , fine lady , " Mr. Otis said . Ira let his eyes close briefly and rubbed the ache in his forehead . " A real angel of mercy . " Mr. Otis said . In stores sometimes Maggie would bring her selections to a clerk and say , " I suppose you expect me to pay for these , " in the fake-tough tone that her brothers used when they were joking . Ira always worried she had overstepped , but the clerk would laugh and say something like : " Well , that thought had occurred to me . " So the world was not as Ira had perceived it , evidently . It was more the way Maggie perceived it . She was the one who got along in it better , collecting strays who stuck to her like lint and falling into heart-to-heart talks with total strangers . This Mr. Otis , for instance : his face alight with enthusiam , his eyes stretched into crepe-edged triangles . " She putsp162me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling Ira . " I knew it was someone ; just could n't think who . " " Chimney ? " " White lady I did not know from Adam , " Mr. Otis said . " She was leaking round her chimney she say and she call me to come give a estimate . But I misstepped somehow and fell right off her roof while I was walking about . Only knocked the wind out as it happened , but Lordy , for a while there I thought I was a goner , laid there on the ground not able to catch my breath , and this lady she insist on driving me to the hospital . On the way , though , my breath come back to me and so I say , ' Mrs. , let 's not go after all , they 'll only take my life savings to say I got nothing wrong with me , ' so she say fine but then has to buy me a cup of coffee and some hash browns at McDonald 's , which happen to lie next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind if we run in afterwards and bought a little red wagon for her nephew whose birthday it was tomorrow ? And I say no and in fact she buy two , one for my niece 's son Elbert also , and next to that is this gardening place  --  " " Yes , that is Maggie , all right , " Ira said . " Not a straight-line kind of person . " " No indeedy , " Ira said . That seemed to use up all their topics of conversation . They fell silent and focused on Maggie , who was returning with a soft-drink can held at arm 's length . " Darn thing just bubbled up all over me , " she called cheerfully . " Ira ? Want a sip ? " " No , thanks . " " Mr. Otis ? " " Oh , why , no , I do n't believe I do , thanks anyhow . " She settled between them and tipped her head back for a long , noisy swig . Ira started wishing for a game of solitaire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way those balloons were bobbing about , though , he guessed his cards might blow away ,  |p163and  so he tucked his hands in his armpits and slouched lower on the wall . They sold balloons like that at Harborplace , or next to it . Lone , grim men stood on street corners with trees of Mylar lozenges floating overhead . He remembered how entranced his sister junie had been when she first saw them . Poor Junie : in a way more seriously handicapped than Dorrie , even  --  more limited , more imprisoned . Her fears confounded them all , becausenothing very dreadful had ever befallen her in the outside world , at least not so far as anyone knew . In the beginning they tried to point that out . They said useless things like : " What 's the worst that could happen ? " and " I 'll be with you . " Then gradually they stopped . They gave up on her and let her stay where she was . Except for Maggie , that is . Maggie was too obstinate to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she conceived the notion that Junie might be persuaded to go out if she could go in costume . She bought Junie a bright-red wig and a skintightdress covered with poppies and a pair of spike-heeled patent-leathershoes with ankle straps . She plastered Junie 's face with heavy makeup . To everyone 's astonishment , it worked . Giggling in a terrified , unhappy way , Junie allowed Maggie and Ira to lead her to the front stoop . The next day , slightly farther . Then finally to the end of the block . Never without Ira , though . She would n't do it with just Maggie ; Maggie was not a blood relation . ( Ira 's father , in fact , would n't even call Maggie by name but referred to her as " Madam . " " Will Madam be coming too , Ira ? "  --  a title that exactly reflected the mocking , skeptical attitude he had assumed toward her from the start . ) " You see what 's at work here , " Maggie said of Junie . " When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; it 's someone else . Her real self is safe at home . " Evidently she was right . Clinging to Ira 's arm with both hands , Junie walked to the pharmacy and requested a copy ofp164Soap Opera Digest . She walked to the grocery store and placed an order for chicken livers in an imperious , brazen manner as if she were another kind of woman entirely  --  a flamboyant , maybe even trampish woman who did n't care what people thought of her . Then she collapsed into giggles again and asked Ira how she was doing . Well , Ira was pleased at her progress , of course , but after a while the whole thing got to be a nuisance . She wanted to venture this place and that , and always it was such a production  --  the preparations , the dress and the makeup , the assurances he was forced to offer . And those ridiculous heels hampered her so . She walked like someone navigating a freshly mopped floor . Really it would have been simpler if she 'd gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself for the thought . Then she got this urge to visit Harborplace . She had watched on TV when Harborplace first opened and she had somehow come to the conclusion that it was one of the wonders of the world . So naturally , after she 'd gained some confidence , nothingwould do but that she must see it in person . Only Ira did n't want to take her . To put it mildly , he was not a fan of Harborplace . He felt it was un-Baltimorean  --  in fact , a glorified shopping mall . And parking would be bound to cost an arm and a leg . Could n't she settle for somewhere else ? No , she could n't , she said . Could n't just Maggie take her , then ? No , she needed Ira . He knew she needed him ; how could he suggest otherwise ? And then their father wanted to come too , and then Dorrie , who was so excited that she already had her " suitcase " ( a Hutzler 's coat box ) packed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to it . They scheduled the trip for a Sunday  --  Ira 's only day off . Unfortunately , it turned out to be a misty , lukewarm morning , with showers predicted for afternoon . Ira suggested a postponementbut no one would hear of it , not even Maggie , who had become as fired up as the others . So he drove them all down/town , where by some miracle he found a parking spot on the street , and they got out and started walking . It was so foggy that buildings just a few yards away were invisible . When they reached the corner of Pratt and Light streets and looked across to Harborplace they could n't even see the pavilions ; they were merely denser patches of gray . The traffic signal , turning green , was the one little pinprick of color . And nobody else was in sight except for a single balloon man , who took shape eerily on the opposite corner as they approached . It was the balloons that snagged Junie 's attention . They seemed made of liquid metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges like sofa cushions . Junie cried , " Oh ! " She stepped up onto the curb , gaping all the while . " What are those ? " she cried . " Balloons , of course , " Ira said . But when he tried to lead her past , she craned back to look at them and so did Dorrie , who was hanging on his other arm . He could see what the problem was . TV had kept Junie informed of the world 's important developments but not the trivial ones , like Mylar ; so those were what stopped her in her tracks . It was perfectly understandable . At that moment , though , Ira just did n't feel like catering to her . He did n't want to be there at all , and so he rushed them forward and around the first pavilion . Junie 's hand was like a claw on his arm . Dorrie , whose left leg had been partially paralyzed after her latest seizure , leaned on his other arm and hobbled grotesquely , her Hutzler 's coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them , Maggie murmured encouragement to his father , whose breathing was growing louder and more effortful . " But those are not any balloons I have had experience of ! " Junie said . " What material is that ? What do they call it ? " By then they had reached the promenade around the water 's edge , and instead of answering , Ira gazed pointedly toward the view . " Is n't this what you were dying to see ? " he reminded her.  |p166But  the view was nothing but opaque white sheets and a fuzzy-edged U.S.S. Constellation riding on a cloud , and Harborplacewas a hulking , silent concentration of vapors . Well , the whole trip ended in disaster , of course . Junie said everything had looked better on TV , and Ira 's father said his heart was flapping in his chest , and then Dorrie somehow got her feelings hurt and started crying and had to be taken home before they 'd set foot inside a pavilion . Ira could n't remember now what had hurt her feelings , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this glaringly sunlit Texaco , was the sensation that had come over him as he stood there between his two sisters . He 'd felt suffocated . The fog had made a tiny room surrounding them , an airless , steamy room such as those that house indoor swimming pools . It had muffled every sound but his family 's close , oppressively familiar voices . It had wrapped them together , locked them in , while his sisters ' hands dragged him down the way drowning victims drag down whoever tries to rescue them . And Ira had thought , Ah , God , I have been trapped with these people all my life and I am never going to be free . And he had known then what a failure he 'd been , ever since the day he took over his father 's business . Was it any wonder he was so sensitive to waste ? He had given up the only serious dream he 'd ever had . You ca n't get more wasteful than that . " Lamont ! " Maggie said . She was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a tow truck , towing nothing . It stopped with a painful screeching sound and the engine died . A black man in a denim jacket swung out of the cab . " That 's him , all right , " Mr. Otis said , rising by inches from his seat . Lamont walked to the rear of the truck and examined something . He kicked a tire and then started toward the cab . He was not as young as Ira had expected  --  no mere boy but a solidlyp167built , glowering man with plum-black skin and a heavy way of walking . " Well , hey there ! " Mr. Otis called . Lamont halted and looked over at him . " Uncle Daniel ? " he said . " How you been , son ? " " What you doing here ? " Lamont asked , approaching . When he reached the wall , Maggie and Ira stood up , but Lamont did n't glance in their direction . " Ai n't you gone back to Aunt Duluth yet ? " he asked Mr. Otis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourn , " Mr. Otis said . " What for ? " " Believe my left front wheel is loose . " " What ? Where 's it at ? " " Out on Route One . This here fellow kindly give me a lift . " Lamont briefly skimmed Ira with his eyes . " We just happened to be driving past , " Ira told him . " Hmm , " Lamont said in an unfriendly tone , and then , turning again to his uncle , " Now let 's see what you telling me . Your car is out on the highway someplace ... " " It was Mrs. here caught on to it , " Mr. Otis said , and he gestured toward Maggie , who beamed up at Lamont trustfully . A slender thread of soft-drink foam traced her upper lip ; it made Ira feel protective . " I wo n't offer you my hand , " she told Lamont . " This Pepsi has just fizzed all over me . " Lamont merely studied her , with the corners of his mouth pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Your wheel ! ' " Mr. Otis said . " Your front wheel is falling off ! ' " " Really that was a fabrication , " Maggie told Lamont . " I made it up . " Sweet Jesus.  |p168Lamont  said , " Say what ? " " I fibbed , " Maggie said blithely . " We admitted as much to your uncle , but I do n't know , it was kind of hard to convince him . " " You saying you told him a lie ? " Lamont asked . " Right . " Mr. Otis smiled self-consciously down at his shoes . " Well , actually  --  " Ira began . " It was after he almost stopped dead in front of us , " Maggie said . " We had to veer off the road , and I was so mad that as soon as we caught up with him I said that about his wheel . But I did n't know he was old ! I did n't know he was helpless ! " " Helpless ? " Mr. Otis asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it did seem his wheel was acting kind of funny , " Maggie told Lamont . " So we brought him here to the Texaco . " Lamont looked no more threatening than he 'd seemed all along , Ira was relieved to see . In fact , he dismissed the two of them entirely . He turned instead to his uncle . " Hear that ? " he asked . " See there ? Now it comes to you running folks off the road . " " Lamont , I 'll tell you the truth , " Mr. Otis said . " I do believe when I think back on it that wheel has not been acting properly for some days now . " " Did n't I say you ought to give up driving ? Did n't we all say that ? Did n't Florence beg you to hand in your license ? Next time you might not be so lucky . Some crazy white man going to shoot your head off next time . " Mr. Otis appeared to shrink , standing there quietly with his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with Aunt Duluth where you belong , none of this would n't be happening , " Lamont told him . " Cruising about on the interstate ! Sleeping here and there like some hippie ! "  | " Well , I had thought I was driving real cautious and careful , " Mr. Otis said . Ira cleared his throat . " So about the wheel  --  " he said . " You just got to go on back home and make up , " Lamont told Mr. Otis . " Quit drawing this thing out and apologize to Aunt Duluth and get that rust heap out of folkses ' way . " " I ca n't apologize ! I ai n't done nothing to be sorry for , " Mr. Otis said . " What 's the difference , man ? Apologize even so . " " See , I could n't have done it ; it was only in her dream . Duluth went and had this dream , see  --  " " You been married fifty-some years to that woman , " Lamont said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snit about something . She ai n't speaking to you or you ai n't speaking to her or she moves out or you moves out . Shoot , man , one time you both moves out and leaves your house standing empty . Plenty would give their right arms for a nice little house like you-all 's , and what do you do ? Leave it stand empty while you off careening about in your Chevy and Aunt Duluth 's sleeping on Florence 's couch discommoding her family . " A reminiscent smile crossed Mr. Otis 's face . " It 's true , " he said . " I had thought I was leaving her , that time , and she thought she was leaving me . " " You two act like quarrelsome children , " Lamont told him . " Well , at least I 'm still married , you notice ! " Mr. Otis said . " At least I 'm still married , unlike some certain others I could name ! " Ira said , " Well , at any rate  --  " " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had n't heard . " Children at least got the time to spare , but you two are old and coming to the end of your lives . Pretty soon one or the other of you going to die and the one that 's left behind will say , Why did I act so ugly ? That was who it was ; that person wasp170who I was with ; and here we threw ourselves away on spitefulness , ' you 'll say . " " Well , it 's probably going to be me that dies first , " Mr. Otis said , " so I just ai n't going to worry about that . " " I 'm serious , Uncle . " " I 'm serious . Could be what you throw away is all that really counts ; could be that 's the whole point of things , would n't that be something ? Spill it ! Spill it all , I say ! No way not to spill it . And anyhow , just look at the times we had . Maybe that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have us a time . We were a real knock-down , drag-out , heart-and-soul type of couple , ' I 'll say . Something to reflect on in the nursing home . " Lamont rolled his eyes heavenward . Ira said , " Well , not to change the subject , but is this wheel business under control now ? " Both men looked over at him . " Oh , " Mr. Otis said finally . " I reckon you two will want to be moving on . " " Only if you 're sure you 're all right , " Maggie told him . " He 'll be fine , " Lamont said . " Get on and go . " " Yes , do n't you give me another thought , " Mr. Otis said . " Let me squire you to your car . " And he walked off between the two of them . Lamont stayed behind , looking disgusted . " That boy is just so cranky , " Mr. Otis told Ira . " I do n't know who he takes after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Oh , surely . He just want to rant and carry on some first . " They reached the Dodge , and Mr. Otis insisted on opening Maggie 's door for her . It took longer than if she had done it herself ; he had to get positioned just right and gain some leverage . Meanwhile he was saying to Ira , " And it ai n't like he had room to criticize . A divorced man ! Handing out advice like a expert ! " He closed the door after Maggie with a loose , ineffectual sound so that she had to reopen it and give it a good slam . " Ap171man who ups and splits at the first little setback , " he told Ira . " Lives alone all pruned and puckerish , drying out like a raisin . Sets alone in front of the TV , night after night , and wo n't go courting nobody new for fear she 'll do him like his wife did . " " Tsk ! " Maggie said , looking up at him through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " " But do you think he sees it ? " Mr. Otis asked . " Naw . " He followed Ira around to the driver 's side of the car . " He believe that 's just a regular life , " he told Ira . " Well , listen , " Ira said as he slid behind the wheel . " If there 's any kind of expense with the tow truck I want to hear about it , understand ? " He shut the door and leaned out the window to say , " I 'd better give you our address . " " There wo n't be no expense , " Mr. Otis said , " but I appreciatethe thought . " He tipped his hat back slightly and scratched his head . " You know I used to have this dog , " he said . " Smartest dog I ever owned . Bessie . She just loved to chase a rubber ball . I would throw it for her and she would chase it . Anytime the ball landed on a kitchen chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spindles of the chair-back and whine and moan and whimper , never dreaming she could just walk around and grab the ball from in front . " Ira said , " Urn ... " " Puts me in mind of Lamont , " Mr. Otis said . " Lamont . " " Blind in spots . " " Oh ! Yes , Lamont ! " Ira said . He was relieved to find the connection . " Well , I do n't want to hold you up , " Mr. Otis told him , and he offered Ira his hand . It felt very light and fragile , like the skeleton of a bird . " You-all take care driving now , hear ? " He bent forward to tell Maggie , " Take care ! " " You too , " she told him . " And I hope things work out with Duluth. "  | " Oh , they will , they will . Sooner or later . " He chuckled and stepped back as Ira started the engine . Like a host seeing off his guests , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and he disappeared from Ira 's rearview mirror . " Well ! " Maggie said , bouncing into a more comfortable position in her seat . " So anyhow ... " As if that whole excursion had been only a little hiccup in the midst of some long story she was telling . Ira turned on the radio but all he could find was the most local kind of news  --  crop prices , a fire in a Knights of Columbus building . He turned it off . Maggie was rooting through her purse . " Now , where on earth ? " she said . " What 're you looking for ? " " My sunglasses . " " On the dashboard . " " Oh , right . " She reached for them and perched them on the end of her nose . Then she rotated her face , staring all around as if testing their effectiveness . " Does n't the sunlight bother your eyes ? " she asked him finally . " No , I 'm fine . " " Maybe I should drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't taken a single turn this whole day , " she said . " That 's all right . Thanks anyhow , sweetheart . " " Well , you just let me know if you change your mind , " she told him , and she sank back in her seat and gazed out at the view . Ira cocked an elbow on the window ledge . He started whistlinga tune . Maggie stiffened and looked over at him . " You just think I 'm some sort of harum-scarum lady driver , " she told him . " Huh ? " he said.  | " You 're just wondering what kind of fool you are even to consider allowing me behind the wheel . " He blinked . He had assumed the subject was concluded . " Lord , Maggie , " he said , " why do you always take things so personally ? " " I just do , that 's why , " she told him , but she spoke without heat , as if uninterested in her own words , and then returned to studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira picked up speed . Traffic had grown heavier , but it was moving briskly . The farms gave way to patches of commercial land  --  a mountain of bald tires , a stepped , angular cliff of cinder blocks , a field of those windowed enclosures that fit over the beds of pickup trucks and turn them into campers . Ira was n't sure what those were called . It bothered him ; he liked to know the names of things , the specific , accurate term that would sum an object up . " Spruce Gum , " Maggie said . " Pardon ? " She was twisted around in her seat , gazing behind her . She said , " Spruce Gum ! That was the cutoff to Fiona 's ! We just now passed it . " " Oh , yes , Spruce Gum , " he said . It did ring a bell . " Ira , " Maggie said . " Hmm ? " " It 's not so far out of the way . " He glanced at her . She had her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth bunched up a little as if she were willing certain words from him ( the way she used to will the right answer out of Jesse when she was drilling him on his multiplication tables ) . " Is it ? " she said . " No , " he said . She misunderstood him ; she drew in a breath to start arguing . But he said , " No , I guess it 's not . "  | " What : You mean you 'll take me there ? " " Well , " he said . And then he said , " Oh , well , we 've already pretty much shot the day , right ? " And he flicked his blinker on and looked for a place to turn the car around . " Thank you , Ira , " she told him , and she slid over as far as her seat belt allowed and planted a little brush stroke of a kiss below his ear . Ira said , " Hmf , " but he sounded more grudging than he really felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he headed back up Route One and took a left onto Spruce Gum Road . They were facing into the sun now . Dusty shafts of light filmed the windshield . Maggie pushed her glasses higher on her nose , and Ira flipped his visor down . Was it the haze on the windshield that made him think again of their trip to Harborplace ? At any rate , for some reason he suddenly remembered why Dorrie had started crying that day . Standing at the water 's edge , hemmed in by fog , she had been moved to open her suitcase and show him its contents . None of what she 'd brought was much different from any other time . There were the usual two or three comic books , he recalled , and probably a snack for her sweet tooth  --  a squashed Hostess cupcake perhaps , with the frosting smashed into the cellophane  --  and of course the rhinestone hatband that had once belonged to their mother . And finally her greatest treasure : a fan magazine with Elvis Presley on the cover . King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ordinarily Ira humored her , even bought her posters whenever he came across them , but on that particular morning he was feeling so burdened , he just had n't had the patience . " Elvis , " Dorrie said happily , and Ira said , " For God 's sake , Dorrie , do n't you know the guy is dead and buried ? " Then she had stopped smiling and her eyes had filled withp175tears , and Ira had felt pierced . Everything about her all at once saddened him  --  her skimpy haircut and her chapped lips and her thin face that was so homely and so sweet , if only people would see . He put an arm around her . He hugged her bony little body close and gazed over her head at the Constellation floating in the fog . The tops of the masts had dwindled away and the ropes and chains had dissolved and the old ship had looked its age for once , swathed in clouds of mist you could mistake for the blurring of time . And Junie had pressed close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadfastly , waiting for him to say what to do next . He had known then what the true waste was ; Lord , yes . It was not his having to support these people but his failure to notice how he loved them . He loved even his worn-down , defeated father , even the memory of his poor mother who had always been so pretty and never realized it because anytime she approached a mirror she had her mouth drawn up lopsided with shyness . But then the feeling had faded ( probably the very next instant , when Junie started begging to leave ) and he forgot what he had learned . And no doubt he would forget again , just as Dorrie had forgotten , by the time they reached home , that Elvis Presley was no longer King of Rock.  |p179Maggie  had a song that she liked to sing with Ira when they were traveling . " On the Road Again , " it was called  --  not the Willie Nelson chestnut but a blues-sounding piece from one of Jesse 's old Canned Heat albums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boom-da-da , boom-da-da , boom-da-da , boom ! boom ! " Maggie sang the melody . " Take a hint from me , Mama , please ! do n't you cry no more , ' " she sang . The telephone poles appeared to be flashing by in rhythm . Maggie felt rangy and freewheeling . She tipped her head back against the seat and swirled one ankle , keeping time . In the old days , when she 'd driven this road alone , the countryside had seemed unwelcoming  --  enemy territory . Among these woods and stony pastures her only grandchild was being held hostage , and Maggie ( smothered in scarves , or swathed in an anonymous trench coat , or half obscured by Junie 's bubbly red wig ) had driven as if slipping between something . She 'd had a sense of slithering , evading . She had fixed her mind on that child and held her face firmly before her : a bright baby face as round as a penny , eyes that widened with enthusiasm whenever Maggie walked into the room , dimpledp180fists revving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leroy ! Do n't forget me ! But then over and over again those trips had proved so unsatisfactory , ending with that last awful time , when Leroy had twisted in her stroller and called , " Mom-Mom ? "  --  hunting her other grandmother , her lesser grandmother , her pretender grandmother ; and Maggie had finally given up and limited herselfthereafter to the rare official visits with Ira . And even those had stopped soon enough . Leroy had begun to fade and dwindle , till one day she was no larger than somebody at the wrong end of a telescope  --  still dear , but very far removed . Maggie thought of last summer when her old cat , Pumpkin , had died . His absence had struck her so intensely that it had amounted to a presence  --  the lack of his furry body twining between her ankles whenever she opened the refrigerator door , the lack of his motorboat purr in her bed whenever she woke up at night . Stupidly , she had been reminded of the time Leroy and Fiona had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here was something even stupider : A month or so later , when cold weather set in , Maggie switched off the basement dehumidifier as she did every year and even that absence had struck her . She had mourned in the most personal way the silencing of the steady , faithful whir that used to thrum the floorboards . What on earth was wrong with her ? she had wondered . Would she spend the rest of her days grieving for every loss equally  --  a daughter-in-law , a baby , a cat , a machine that dries the air out ? Was this how it felt to grow old ? Now the fields were a brassy color , as pretty as a picture on a calendar . They held no particular significance . Maybe it helped that Ira was with her  --  an ally . Maybe it was just that sooner or later , even the sharpest pain became flattened . " But I ai n't going down that long old lonesome road all by myself , ' " she sang automatically , and Ira sang , " Boom-dada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely acquire a new mother-in-law . Maggie had n't considered that . She wondered if Fiona and this woman would be close . Would they spend their every free moment together , as cozy as two girlfriends ? " And suppose she has another baby ! " Maggie said . Ira broke off his boom-das to ask , " Huh ? " " I saw her through that whole nine months ! What will she do without me ? " " Who 're you talking about ? " " Fiona , of course . Who do you think ? " " Well , I 'm sure she 'll manage somehow , " Ira said . Maggie said , " Maybe , and maybe not . " She turned away from him to look out at the fields again . They seemed unnaturallytextureless . " I drove her to her childbirth classes , " she said . " I drilled her in her exercises . I was her official labor coach . " " So now she knows all about it , " Ira said . " But it 's something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " You have to keep at it . " She thought of how she had kept at Fiona , whom pregnancy had turned lackadaisical and vague , so that if it had n't been for Maggie she 'd have spent her entire third trimester on the couch in front of the TV . Maggie would clap her hands briskly  --  " Okay ! "  --  and snap off the Love Boat rerun and fling open the curtains , letting sunshine flood the dim air of the living room and the turmoil of rock magazines and Fresca bottles . " Time for your pelvic squats ! " she would cry , and Fiona would shrink and raise one arm to shield her eyes from the light . " Pelvic squats , good grief , " she would say . " Abdominal humps . It all sounds so gross . " But she would heave to her feet , sighing . Even in pregnancy , her body was a teenager 's  --  slender and almost rubbery , reminding Maggie of those scantily clad girls she 'd glimpsed on beaches who seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mound of thep182baby was a separate burden , a kind of package jutting out in front of her . " Breathing lessons  --  really , " she said , dropping to the floor with a thud . " Do n't they reckon I must know how to breathe by now ? " " Oh , honey , you 're just lucky they offer such things , " Maggietold her . " My first pregnancy , there was n't a course to be found , and I was scared to death . I 'd have loved to take lessons ! And afterward : I remember leaving the hospital with Jesse and thinking , Wait . Are they going to let me just walk off with him ? I do n't know beans about babies ! I do n't have a license to do this . Ira and I are just amateurs . ' I mean you 're given all these lessons for the unimportant things  --  piano-playing , typing . You 're given years and years of lessons in how to balance equations , which Lord knows you will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parenthood ? Or marriage , either , come to think of it . Before you can drive a car you need a state-approved course of instruction , but driving a car is nothing , nothing , compared to living day in and day out with a husband and raising up a new human being . " Which had not been the most reassuring notion , perhaps ; for Fiona had said , " Jimmy , " and dropped her head in her hands . " Though I 'm certain you 'll do fine , " Maggie said in a hurry , " And of course you have me here to help you . " " Oh , jimmy , " Fiona said . Ira turned down a little side road called Elm Lane  --  a double string of tacky one-story cottages with RVs in most of the drivewaysand sometimes a sloping tin trailer out back . Maggie asked him , " Who will wake up in the night now and bring her the baby to nurse ? " " Her husband , one would hope , " Ira said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , the way you should have had her do last time . " Then he gave his shoulders a slight shake , as if ridding himself of something , and said , " What baby ? Fi/ona 's not having a baby ; she 's just getting married , or so you claim . Let 's put first things first here . " Well , but first things were n't put first the time before ; Fiona had been two months pregnant when she married Jesse . Not that Maggie wanted to remind him of that . Besides , her thoughts were on something else now . She was caught by an unexpected , piercingly physical memory of bringing the infant Leroy in to Fiona for her 2 a. m. feeding  --  that downy soft head wavering on Maggie 's shoulder , that birdlike mouth searching the bend of Maggie 's neck inside her bathrobe collar , and then the close , sleep-smelling warmth of Jesse 's and Fiona 's bedroom . " Oh , " she said without meaning to , and then , " Oh ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not really a yard at all ) stood a wiry little girl with white-blond hair that stopped short squarely at her jawline . She had just let go of a yellow Frisbee , which sailed shuddering toward their car and landed with a thump on the hood as Ira swung into the driveway . " That 's not  --  " Maggie said . " Is that  --  ? " " Must be Leroy , " Ira told her . " It 's not ! " But of course , it had to be . Maggie was forced to make such a leap across time , though  --  from the infant on her shoulder to this gawky child , all in two seconds . She was experiencing some difficulty . The child dropped her hands to her sides and stared at them . Frowning gave her forehead a netted look . She wore a pink tank top with some kind of red stain down the front , berry juice or Kool-Aid , and baggy shorts in a blinding Hawaiian print . Her face was so thin it was triangular , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow white stems . " Maybe it 's a neighbor girl , " Maggie told Ira  --  a last-ditch effort . He did n't bother replying . As soon as he switched the ignition off , Maggie opened the door and stepped out . She called " Leroy ? "  | " What . " " Are you Leroy ? " The child deliberated a moment , as if uncertain , and then nodded . " So , " Maggie said . " Well , hi there ! " she cried . Leroy went on staring . She did n't seem one grain less suspicious . Actually , Maggie reflected ( already adjusting to new developments ) , this was one of the most interesting ages . Seven and a half  --  old enough to converse with but not yet past willing to admire a grownup , provided the grownup played her cards right . Cagily , Maggie rounded the car and approached the child with her purse in both hands , resisting the urge to fling out her arms for a hug . " I guess you must not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Leroy shook her head . " Why , sweetie , I 'm your grandma ! " " You are ? " Leroy said . She reminded Maggie of someone peering through a veil . " Your other grandma . Your Grandma Moran . " It was crazy to have to introduce herself to her own flesh and blood . And crazier still , Maggie thought , that Jesse would have needed to do the same thing . He had not laid eyes on his daughter since  --  when ? Since just after he and Fiona split up  --  before Leroy was a year old , even . What a sad , partitioned life they all seemed to be living ! " I 'm from your father 's side of the family , " she told Leroy , and Leroy said , " Oh . " So at least she did know she had a father . " And this is your grandpa , " Maggie said . Leroy shifted her gaze to Ira . In profile , her nose was seen to be tiny and extremely pointed . Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of the car by now , but he did n't come over top185Leroy immediately . Instead he reached for the Frisbee on the hood . Then he crossed the yard to them , meanwhile studying the Frisbee and turning it around and around in his hands as if he 'd never seen one before . ( Was n't this just like him ? AllowingMaggie to rush in while he hung back all reserved , but you notice he did tag along , and would share the benefit of anything she accomplished . ) When he arrived in front of Leroy he tossed the Frisbee toward her lightly , and both her hands came up like two skinny spiders to grab it . " Thanks , " she said . Maggie wished she had thought of the Frisbee . " We do n't seem familiar at all ? " she asked Leroy . Leroy shook her head . " Why ! I was standing by when you were born , I 'll have you know . I was waiting in the hospital for you to be delivered . You stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " " I did ? " " You do n't remember staying with us ? " " How could she , Maggie ? " Ira asked . " Well , she might , " Maggie said , for she herself had a very clear memory of a scratchy-collared dress she used to hate being stuffed into as an infant . And besides , you would think all that loving care had to have left some mark , would n't you ? She said , " Or Fiona might have told her about it . " " She told me I lived in Baltimore , " Leroy said . " That was us , " Maggie said . " Your parents lived with us in your daddy 's old boyhood room in Baltimore . " " Oh . " " Then you and your mother moved away . " Leroy rubbed her calf with the instep of her bare foot . She was standing very straight , militarily straight , giving the impressionshe was held there only by a sense of duty . " We visited on your birthdays afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was just a little thing , Maggie , " Ira said . " We came for your first three birthdays , " Maggie persisted . ( Sometimes you could snag a memory and reel it in out of nowhere , if you used the proper hook . ) " But your second birthdayyou were off at Hershey Park , and so we did n't get to see you . " I 've been to Hershey Park six times , " Leroy said . " Mindy Brant has only been twice . " " Your third birthday , we brought you a kitten . " Leroy tilted her head . Her hair wafted to one side  --  corn silk , lighter than air . " A tiger kitten , " she said . " Right . " " Stripy all over , even on its tummy . " " You do remember ! " " That was you-all brought me that kitten ? " " That was us , " Maggie said . Leroy looked back and forth between the two of them . Her skin was delicately freckled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That must come from the Stuckey side . Maggie 's family never freckled , and certainly Ira 's did n't , with their Indian connections . " And then what happened ? " she was asking . " What happened when ? " " What happened to the kitten ! You must 've took it back . " " Oh , no , honey , we did n't take it back . Or rather , we did but only because you turned out to be allergic . You started sneezing and your eyes got teary . " " And after that , what ? " Leroy asked . " Well , I wanted to visit again , " Maggie said , " but your grandpa told me we should n't . I wanted to with all my heart , but your grandpa told me  --  " " I meant , what did you do with the kitten , " Leroy said . " Oh . The kitten . Well . We gave it to your grandpa 's twosisters , your . . . great-aunts , I suppose they 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? "  | " No , actually it was hit by a car , " Maggie said . " Oh . " " It was n't used to traffic and somehow it slipped out when someone left the door open . " Leroy stared ahead , fixedly . Maggie hoped she had n't upset her . She said , " So tell me ! Is your mother home ? " " My mother ? Sure . " " Could we see her , maybe ? " Ira said , " Maybe she 's busy . " " No , she 's not busy , " Leroy said , and she turned and started toward the house . Maggie did n't know if they were supposed to follow or not . She looked over at Ira . He was standing there slouched with his hands in his trouser pockets , so she took her cue from him and stayed where she was . " Ma ! " Leroy called , climbing the two front steps . Her voice had a certain mosquito quality that went with her thin face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen door . " Hey , Ma ! " Then all at once there was Fiona leaning in the doorway , one arm outstretched to keep the screen door from banging shut again . She wore cut-off denim shorts and a T-shirt with some kind of writing across it . " No need to shout , " she said . At that moment she saw Maggie and Ira . She stood up straighter . Maggie moved forward , clutching her purse . She said , " How are you , Fiona ? " " Well . . . fine , " Fiona said . And then she looked beyond them . Oh , Maggie was not mistaken about that . Her eyes swept the yard furtively and alighted on the car for just the briefest instant . She was wondering if Jesse had come too . She still cared enough to wonder . Her eyes returned to Maggie . " I hope we 're not disturbing you , " Maggie said . " Oh , urn , no , ... " " We were just passing through and thought we 'd stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and smoothed her hair off herp188forehead with the back of her hand  --  a gesture that exposed the satiny white inner surface of her wrist , that made her seem distracted , at a loss . Her hair was still fairly long but she had done something to it that bushed it out more ; it did n't hang in sheets now . And she had gained a bit of weight . Her face was slightly broader across the cheekbones , the hollow of her collarbonewas less pronounced , and although she was translucentlypale , as always , she must have started using makeup , for Maggie detected a half-moon of powdered shadow on each eyelid  --  that rose-colored shadow that seemed to be so popular lately , that made women look as if they were suffering from a serious cold . Maggie climbed the steps and stood next to Leroy , continuing to hold her purse in a way that implied she was n't expecting so much as a handshake . She was able now to read the writing on Fiona 's shirt : LIME SPIDERS , it said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio this morning . " she said . " Radio , " Fiona said , still distracted . " On AM Baltimore . " " Baltimore , " Fiona said . Leroy , meanwhile , had ducked under her mother 's arm and then turned so she was facing Maggie , side by side with Fiona , gazing up with the same unearthly clear-aqua eyes . There was n't a trace of Jesse in that child 's appearance . You 'd think at least his coloring would have won out . " I told Ira , Why not just stop off and visit , ' " Maggie said . " We were up this way anyhow , for Max Gill 's funeral . RememberMax Gill ? My friend Serena 's husband ? He died of cancer . So I said , Why not stop off and visit Fiona . We would n't stay but a minute . ' " " It feels funny to see you , " Fiona said . " Funny ? " " I mean . . . Come inside , why do n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie said.  | " No , I 'm not busy . Come on in . " Fiona turned and led the way into the house . Leroy followed , with Maggie close behind . Ira took a little longer . When Maggie looked over her shoulder she found him kneeling in the yard to tie his shoe , a slant of hair falling over his forehead . " Well , come on , Ira , " she told him . He rose in silence and started toward her . Her annoyance changed to something softer . Sometimes Ira took on a gangling aspect , she thought , like a bashful young boy not yet comfortable in public . The front door opened directly into the living room , where the sun slipping through the venetian blinds striped the green shag rug . Heaps of crocheted cushions tumbled across a couch upholstered in a fading tropical print . The coffee table bore sliding stacks of magazines and comic books , and a green ceramicashtray shaped like a rowboat . Maggie remembered the ashtray from earlier visits . She remembered staring at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which case it would make a perfect bathtub toy for Leroy . Now that came back to her , evidently having lurked all these years within some cupboard in her brain : " Have a seat , " Fiona said , plumping a cushion . She asked Ira , " So how 're you doing ? " as he ducked his head in the doorway . " Oh , passably , " he told her . Maggie chose the couch , hoping Leroy would sit there too . But Leroy dropped to the rug and stretched her reedy legs out in front of her . Fiona settled in an armchair , and Ira remained standing . He circled the room , pausing at a picture of two basset puppies nestled together in a hatbox . With the tip of one finger , he traced the gilded molding that lined the frame . " Would you like some refreshments ? " Fiona asked . Maggie said , " No , thank you . " " Maybe a soda or something . "  | " We 're not thirsty , honestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're not who I was asking . " Fiona told her . Maggie wished she 'd brought Leroy some sort of present . They had so little time to make connections ; she felt pushed and anxious . " Leroy , " she said too brightly , " is Frisbee a big interest of yours ? " " Not really , " Leroy told her bare feet . " Oh . " " I 'm still just learning , " Leroy said . " I ca n't make it go where I want yet . " " Yes , that 's the tricky part , all right , " Maggie said . Unfortunately , she had no experience with Frisbees herself . She looked hopefully at Ira , but he had moved on to some kind of brown metal appliance that stood in the corner  --  a box fan , perhaps , or a heater . She turned back to Leroy . " Does it glow in the dark ? " she asked after a pause . Leroy said , " Huh ? " " Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Does your Frisbee glow in the dark ? Some do , I believe . " " Not this one , " Leroy said . " Ah ! " Maggie cried . " Then maybe we should buy you one that does . " Leroy thought about that . Finally she asked , " Why would I want to play Frisbee in the dark ? " " Good question , " Maggie said . She sat back , spent , wondering where to go from there . She looked again at Ira . He was hunkered over the appliance now , inspecting the controls with total concentration . Well , no point avoiding this forever . Maggie made herself smile . She tilted her head receptively and said , " Fiona , we were so surprised to hear about your wedding plans . " " My what ? " " Wedding plans . "  | " Is that supposed to be a joke ? " " Joke ? " Maggie asked . She faltered . " Are n't you getting married ? " " Not that I 'm aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Fiona said , " What is this radio business ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " On WNTK , " Maggie said . " You called in and said  --  " " The station I listen to is WXLR , " Fiona told her . " No , this was  --  " " Excellent Rock Around the Clock . A Brittstown station . " " This was WNTK , " Maggie said . " And they claimed I was getting married ? " " You claimed it . You called in and claimed your wedding was next Saturday . " " Not me , " Fiona said . There was a kind of alteration of rhythm in the room . Maggie experienced a surge of relief , followed by acute embarrassment . How could she have been so sure ? What on earth had got into her , not even to question that the voice she 'd heard was Fiona 's ? And on such a staticky , inadequate radio ; she 'd known perfectly well how inadequate it was , with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high fidelity . She braced herself for Ira 's I-told-you-so . He still seemed absorbed in the appliance , though , which was nice of him . " I guess I made a mistake , " she said finally . " I guess you did , " Fiona said . And Leroy said , " Married ! " and uttered a little hiss of amusementand wiggled her toes . Each toenail , Maggie saw , bore the tiniest dot of red polish , almost completely chipped off . " So who was the lucky guy ? " Fiona asked . " You did n't say , " Maggie told her . " What : I just came on the air and announced my engagement ? " " It was a call-in talk show , " Maggie said . She spoke slowly ;  |p192she  was rearranging her thoughts . All at once Fiona was not getting married . There was still a chance , then ! Things could still be worked out ! And yet in some illogical way Maggie continued to believe the wedding really had been planned , so that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to discuss their marriages with the host , " she said . Fiona knit her pale brows , as if considering the possibility that she might have been one of them . She was so pretty , and Leroy was so endearingly spiky and unusual ; Maggie felt how thirsty her eyes were , drinking them in . It was like the early days with her children , when every neck-crease , every knuckle-dent , could send her into a reverie . Look at Fiona 's hair shining like ribbons , like bands of crinkle gift ribbon ! Look at the darling little gold studs in Leroy 's earlobes ! Ira , speaking into the grille of the appliance , said , " This thing really do much good ? " His voice rang back at them tinnily . " So far as I know , " Fiona said . " Fairly energy-efficient ? " She lifted both hands , palms up . " Beats me . " " How many BTUs does it give off ? " " That 's just something Mom runs in the wintertime to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have paid it much heed , to tell the truth . " Ira leaned farther forward to read a decal on the appliance 's rear . Maggie seized on a change of subject . She said , " How is your mother , Fiona ? " " Oh , she 's fine . Right now she 's at the grocery store . " " Wonderful , " Maggie said . Wonderful that she was fine , she meant . But it was also wonderful that she was out . She said , " And you 're looking well too . You 're wearing your hair a little fuller , are n't you ? " " It 's crimped , " Fiona said . " I use this special iron , like ; you know bigger hair has a slimming effect . "  | " Slimming ! You do n't need slimming . " " I most certainly do . I put on seven pounds over this past summer . " Oh , you did n't , either . You could n't have ! Why you 're just a  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just a stick . But she got mixed up and combined the two words : " You 're just a twick ! " Fiona glanced at her sharply , and no wonder ; it had sounded vaguely insulting . " Just skin and bones , I mean , " Maggie said , fighting back a giggle . She remembered now how fragile their relationship had been , how edgy and defensive Fiona had often seemed . She folded her hands and placed her feet carefully together on the green shag rug . So Fiona was not getting married after all . " How 's Daisy ? " Fiona asked . " She 's doing well . " Leroy said , " Daisy who ? " " Daisy Moran , " Fiona said . Without further explanation , she turned back to Maggie . " All grown up by now , I bet . " " Daisy is your aunt . Your daddy 's little sister , " Maggie told Leroy . " Yes ; tomorrow she leaves for college , " she said to Fiona . " College ! Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . . . but it 's true she won a full scholarship . " " Little bitty Daisy , " Fiona said . " Just think . " Ira had finished with the appliance , finally . He moved on to the coffee table . The Frisbee rested on a pile of comic books , and he picked it up and examined it all over again . Maggie stole a peek at him . He still had not said , " I told you so , " but she thought she detected something noble and forbearing in the set of his spine . " You know , I 'm in school myself , in a way , " Fiona said . " Oh ? What kind of school ? " " I 'm studying electrolysis . " " Why , that 's lovely , Fiona , " Maggie said . She wished she could shake off this fulsome tone of voice.  |p194It  seemed to belong to someone else entirely  --  some elderly , matronly , honey-sweet woman endlessly marveling and exclaiming . " The beauty parlor where I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiona said . " They want their own licensed operator . They say I 'm sure to make heaps of money . " " That 's just lovely ! " Maggie said . " Then maybe you can move out and find a place of your own . " And leave the pretender grandma behind , was what she was thinking . But Fiona gave her a blank look . Leroy said , " Show them your practice kit , Ma . " " Yes , show us , " Maggie said . " Oh , you do n't want to see that , " Fiona said . " Yes , we do . Do n't we , Ira ? " Ira said , " Hmm ? Oh , absolutely . " He held the Frisbee up level , like a tea tray , and gave it a meditative spin . " Well , then , wait a sec , " Fiona said , and she got up and left the room . Her sandals made a dainty slapping sound on the wooden floor of the hallway " They 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leroy told Maggie . " Professionally painted with Ma 's name . " " Is n't that something ! " " It 's a genuine science , Ma says . You 've got to have trained experts to teach you how to do it . " Leroy 's expression was cocky and triumphant . Maggie resistedthe urge to reach down and cup the complicated small bones of her knee . Fiona returned , carrying a rectangular yellow kitchen sponge and a short metal rod the size of a ballpoint pen . " First we practice with a dummy instrument , " she said . She dropped onto the couch beside Maggie . " We 're supposed to work at getting the angle exactly , perfectly right . " She set the sponge on her lap and gripped the rod between her fingers . There was a needle at its tip , Maggie saw . For somep195reason she had always thought of electrolysis as , oh , not quite socially mentionable , but Fiona was so matter-of-fact and so skilled , targeting one of the sponge 's pores and guiding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help feeling impressed . This was a highly technical field , she realized  --  maybe something like dental hygiene . Fiona said , " We travel into the follicle , see , easy , easy . . . " and then she said , " Oops ! " and raised the heel of her hand an inch or two . " If this was a real person I 'd have been leaning on her eyeball , " she said . " Pardon me , lady , " she told the sponge . " I did n't mean to smush you . " Mottled black lettering was stamped acrossthe sponge 's surface : STABLER 'S DARK BEER . MADE WITH MOUNTAINSPRING WATER . Ira stood over them now , with the Frisbee dangling from his fingers . He asked , " Does the school provide the sponge ? " " Yes , it 's included in the tuition , " Fiona said . " They must get it free , " he reflected . " Courtesy of Stabler 's . Interesting . " " Stabler 's ? Anyhow , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Us students all work on each other : eyebrows and mustache and such . This girl that 's my partner , Hilary , she wants me to do her bikini line . " Ira pondered that for a moment and then backed off in a hurry . " You know these high-cut swimsuits nowadays , they show everything you 've got , " Fiona told Maggie . " Oh , it 's becoming impossible ! " Maggie cried . " I 'm just making do with my old suit till the fashions change . " Ira cleared his throat and said , " Leroy , what would you say to a game of Frisbee . " Leroy looked up at him . " I could show you how to make it go where you want , " he told her . She took so long deciding that Maggie felt a pang for Ira'sp196sake , but finally she said , " Well , okay , " and unfolded herself from the floor . " Tell about the professionally painted sign , " she told Fiona . Then she followed Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like a harmonica chord before it banged shut . So . This was the first time Maggie had been alone with Fiona since that awful morning . For once the two of them were free of Ira 's hampering influence and the hostile , suspicious presence of Mrs. Stuckey . Maggie edged forward on the couch . She clasped her hands tightly ; she pointed her knees intimately in Fiona 's direction . " The sign 's going to read FIONA MORAN , " Fiona was saying . " LICENSED ELECTROLOGIST . PAINLESS REMOVAL OF SUPERFLUOUS HAIR . " " I ca n't wait to see it , " Maggie said . She thought about that last name : Moran . If Fiona really hated Jesse , would she have kept his name all these years ? " On the radio , " she said , " you told the man you were marryingfor security . " " Maggie , I swear to you , the station I listen to is  --  " " WXLR , " Maggie said . " Yes , I know . But I just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I ... " She watched Fiona set the sponge and needle in the rowboat ashtray . " Anyway , " she said . " Whoever it was who called , she said the first time she 'd married for love and it had n't worked out . So this time she was aiming purely for security . " " Well , what a ninny , " Fiona said . " If marriage was such a drag when she loved the guy , what would it be like when she did n't ? " " Exactly , " Maggie said . " Oh , Fiona , I 'm so glad that was n't you ! " " Shoot , I do n't even have a steady boyfriend , " Fiona said.  | " You do n't ? " But Maggie found the phrasing of that a bit worrisome . She said , " Does that mean . . . you have someone not steady ? " " I just barely get to date at all , " Fiona said . " Well ! What a pity , " Maggie said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy ? Mark Derby ? I went out with him for about three months , but then we had a fight . I bashed his car in after I had borrowed it , was the reason . But it really was n't my fault . I was starting to make a left turn , when these teenage boys came up from behind and passed me on the left and so of course I hit them . Then they had the nerve to claim it was all my doing ; they claimed I had my right-turn signal on instead of my left . " " Well , anyone who 'd get mad about that you do n't want to date anyhow , " Maggie told her . " I said , I had my left-turn signal on . Do n't you think I know my left from my right ? ' " " Of course you do , " Maggie said soothingly . She lifted her left hand and flicked an imaginary turn signal , testing . " Yes , left is down and right is . . . or maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's exactly the same , " Fiona told her . " At least , I think itis . D ) " Then maybe it was the windshield wipers , " Maggie said . " I 've done that , lots of times : switched on my wipers instead of my blinkers . " Fiona considered . Then she said , " No , because something was lit up . Otherwise they would n't say I was signaling a right turn . " " One time I had my mind elsewhere and I went for my blinkers and shifted gears instead , " Maggie said . She started laughing . " Going along about sixty miles an hour and shifted into reverse . Oh , Lord . " She pulled the corners of her mouthp198down , recollecting herself . " Well , " she told Fiona , " I 'd say you 're better off without the man . " " What man ? Oh . Mark , " Fiona said . " Yes , it 's not like we were in love or anything . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mom is friends with his mom . He has the nicest mother ; real sweet-faced woman with a little bit of a stammer . I always feel a stammer shows sincerity of feeling , do n't you ? " Maggie said , " Why , c-c-certainly I do . " It took Fiona a second to catch on . Then she laughed . " Oh , you 're such a card , " she said , and she tapped Maggie 's wrist . " I 'd forgotten what a card you are . " " So is that the end of it ? " Maggie asked . " End of what ? " " This . . . thing with Mark Derby . I mean suppose he asks you out again ? " " No way , " Fiona said . " Him and his precious Subaru ; no way would I go out with him . " " ' That 's very wise of you , " Maggie told her . " Shoot ! I 'd have to be a moron . " " Ile was a moron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Hey . How 's about a beer . " " Oh , I 'd love a beer ! " Fiona jumped up , tugging down her shorts , and left the room . Maggie sank lower on the couch and listened to the sounds drifting in through the window  --  a car swishing past and Leroy 's throaty chuckle . If this house were hers , she thought , she would get rid of all this clutter . You could n't see the surface of the coffee table , and the layers of sofa cushions nudged her lower back uncomfortably . " Only thing we 've got is Bud Light is that okay ? " Fiona asked when she returned . She was carrying two cans and a sack of potato chips . " It 's perfect ; I 'm on a diet , " Maggie said . She accepted one of the cans and popped the tab , whilep199Fiona settled next to her on the couch . " I ought to go on a diet , " Fiona said . She ripped open the cellophane sack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , mine too , " Maggie said . She took a sip of her beer . It was crisp-tasting and bitter ; it brought memories flooding in the way the smell of a certain perfume will . How long had it been since she 'd last had a beer ? Maybe not since Leroy was a baby . Back then ( she recalled as she waved away the potato chips ) , she sometimes drank as many as two or three cans a day , keeping Fiona company because beer was good for her milk supply , they 'd heard . Now that would probably be frowned upon , but at the time they had felt dutiful and virtuous , sipping their Miller High Lifes while the baby drowsily nursed . Fiona used to say she could feel the beer zinging directly to her breasts . She and Maggie would start drinking when Maggie came home from work  --  midafternoon or so , just the two of them . They would grow all warm and confiding together . By the time Maggiegot around to fixing supper she would be feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism , and then later at the table she might act a bit more talkative than usual . It was nothing the others would notice , though . Except perhaps for Daisy . " Really , Mom . Honestly , " Daisy would say . But then , she was always saying that . As was Maggie 's mother , come to think of it . " Honestly , Maggie . " She had stopped by late one afternoon and caught Maggie lounging on the couch , a beer balanced on her midriff , while Fiona sat next to her singing " Dust in the Wind " to the baby . " How have you let things get so common ? " Mrs. Daley had asked , and Maggie , looking around her , had all at once wondered too . The cheap , pulpy magazines scattered everywhere , the wadded wet diapers , the live-in daughter-in-law  --  it did look common . How had it happened ? " I wonder if Claudine and Peter ever married , " Maggie said now , and she took another sip of her beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On that soap opera we used to watch . Remember ? His sister Natasha was trying to split them up . " " Oh , Lord , Natasha . She was one mean lady , " Fiona said . She dug deep into the sack of potato chips . " They had just got engaged when you left us , " Maggie said . " They were planning to throw a big party and then Natasha found out about it remember ? " " She looked kind of like this girl I always detested in elementaryschool , " Fiona said . " Then you left us , " Maggie said . Fiona said , " Actually , now that you mention it she must not have managed to split them up after all , because a couple of years later they had this baby that was kidnapped by a dementedairline stewardess . " " At first I could n't believe you had really gone for good , " Maggie said . " Whole months passed by when I 'd come home and switch on the TV and check what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill you in when you got back . " " Anyhow , " Fiona said . She set her beer on the coffee table . " Silly of me , was n't it ? Wherever you had gone , you surely would have been near a TV . It 's not like you had abandoned civilization . But I do n't know ; maybe I just wanted to keep up with the story for my own sake , so that after you came back we could carry on like before . I was positive you 'd be coming back . " " Well , anyhow . What 's past is past , " Fiona said . " No , it 's not ! People are always saying that , but what 's past is never past ; not entirely , " Maggie told her . " Fiona , this is a marriage we 're talking about . You two had so much sunk into it ; such an exhausting amount was sunk in . And then one day you quarreled over nothing whatsoever , no worse than any other time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrugged your shoulders and walked away from it ! How could that be possible ? " " It just was , all right ? " Fiona said . " Jiminy ! Do we have top201keep rehashing this ? " And she reached for her beer can and drank , tipping her head far back . She wore rings on every one of her fingers , Maggie saw  --  some plain silver , some set with turquoise stones . That was new . But her nails were still painted the pearly pink that had always seemed her special color , that could bring her instantly to mind whenever Maggie caught sight of it somewhere . Maggie rotated her own can thoughtfully , meanwhile stealingsideways peeks at Fiona . " I wonder where Leroy 's got to , " Fiona said . Another evasion . It was obvious where she 'd got to ; she was right outside the window . " Give her a little more spin , now , " Ira was saying , and Leroy called , " Watch out , here comes a killer ! " " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , " Maggie told Fiona . " Look . How many times  --  " " Yes , yes , " Maggie said hastily , " that was n't you ; I understand . But still , something about what the girl on the radio was saying . . . I mean it 's like she was speaking for more than just herself . It 's like she was talking about what the whole world was doing . Next Saturday I 'm marrying for security , ' she said , and I just suddenly had this sense that the world was sort of drying up or withering away or something , getting small and narrow and pinched . I felt so  --  I do n't know  --  so unhopeful , all of a sudden . Fiona , maybe I should n't mention this , but last spring Jesse brought this young woman he 'd met to supper  --  oh , no one important ! not anybody important !  --  and I thought to myself , Well , she 's all very well and good , I suppose , but she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second best , I thought . We 're only making do here . Oh , why is everyone settling for less ? is what I thought . And I feel the same way about what's-his-name , Mark Derby . Why bother dating someone merely because he asks you , when you and Jesse love each other so much ? "  | " You call it love when he signed that lawyer 's papers without a word and sent them back , not putting up the slightest token of a fight ? " Fiona asked . " When he 's two or three or even four months late with his support check and then mails it without a letter or a note , not even my full name on the envelope but only F. Moran ? " " Well , that 's pure pride , Fiona . Both of you are way too " " And when he has n't laid eyes on his daughter since her fifth birthday ? Try explaining that to a child . Oh , he 's just proud , Leroy , honey  --  ' " " Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering why all the other kids have fathers . Even the kids whose parents are divorced  --  at least they get to see their fathers on weekends . " " He visited on her fifth birthday ? " Maggie asked . " Look at that ! He did n't even bother telling you . " " What : He just showed up ? Or what ? " " He showed up out of the blue in a car packed to the teeth with the most unsuitable presents you ever saw , " Fiona said . " Stuffed animals and dolls , and a teddy bear so big he had to strap it in the front seat like a human because it would n't fit through the rear door . It was much too big for a child to cuddle , not that Leroy would have wanted to . She is n't a cuddly type of person . She 's more the sporty type . He should have brought her athletic equipment ; he should have brought her  --  " " But , Fiona , how was he to know that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; she grieved for her son with his earful of wrongheaded gifts that he must have spent his last penny on , because heaven knows he was n't well off . She said , " He was trying his best , after all . He just did n't realize . " " Of course he did n't realize ! He did n't have the faintest idea ; the last time he visited , she was still a baby . So here he comes with this drink-and-wet doll that cries Mama , ' and when hep203catches sight of Leroy in her dungarees he stops short ; you can see he 's not pleased . He says , Who is that ? ' He says , But she 's so  --  ' I had had to run fetch her from the neighbor 's and quick smooth down her hair on the way through the alley . In the alley I told her , Tuck your shirt in , honey . Here , let me lend you my barrette , ' and Leroy stood still for it , which she would n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrette I said , Stand back and let me look at you , ' and she stood back and licked her lips and said , Am I okay ? Or not . ' I said , Oh , honey , you 're beautiful , ' and then she walks into the house and Jesse says , But she 's so  --  ' " " He was surprised she had grown , that 's all it was , " Maggie said . " I could have cried for her , " Fiona said . " Yes , " Maggie said gently . She knew how that felt . Fiona said , " She 's so what , Jesse ? ' I ask him . She 's so what ? How dare you come tromping in here telling me she 's so something or other when the last time you sent us a check was December ? And instead you waste your money on this trash , this junk , ' I tell him , this poochy-faced baby doll when the only doll she 'll bother with is G.I. Joe . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , what did he expect ? " " Oh , why does this always happen between you two ? He loves you , Fiona . He loves you both . He 's just the world 's most inept at showing it . If you knew what it must have cost him to make that trip ! I ca n't tell you how often I 've asked him , I 've said , Are you planning to let your daughter just drift on out of your life ? Because that 's what she 's bound to do , Jesse ; I 'm warning you , ' and he said , ' No , but I do n't . . . but I ca n't figure how to . . . I ca n't stand to be one of those artificial fathers , ' he said , with those busywork visits to zoos and smalltalksuppers at McDonald 's . ' And I said , Well , it 's better than nothing , is n't it ? ' and he said , No , it is not better than nothing.  |p204It  's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , anyhow ? '  --  thatway he does , you 've seen how he does , where he acts so furious but if you look at his eyes you 'll notice these sudden dark rings beneath them that he used to get when he was just a little fellow trying not to cry . " Fiona ducked her head . She started tracing the rim of her beer can with one finger . " On Leroy 's first birthday , " Maggie said , " he was all set to come with us and visit , I told you that . I said , Jesse , I really feel it would mean a lot to Fiona if you came , ' and he said , Well , maybe I will , then . Yes , ' he said , I could do that , I guess , ' and he asked me about fifty times what kind of present a year-old baby might enjoy . Then he went shopping all Saturdayand brought back one of those shape-sorter boxes , but Monday after work he exchanged it for a woolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem like he was pushing her intellectuallyor anything . ' I do n't want to be like Grandma Daley , always popping up with these educational toys , ' he said , and then on Thursday  --  her birthday was a Friday that year , remember ?  --  heasked me exactly how you had phrased your invitation . ' I mean , ' he said , did it sound to you like maybe she was expecting me to stay on over the weekend ? Because if so then I might borrow Dave 's van and drive up separately from you and Dad . ' And I said , Well , you could do that , Jesse . Yes , what a good idea ; why do n't you . ' He said , But how did she word it , is what I 'm asking , ' and I said , Oh , I forget , ' and he said , Think . ' I said , Well , as a matter of fact . . . ' I said , ' Urn , in fact , she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight out , ' and he said , Wait . I thought she told you it would mean a lot to her if I came . ' I said , No , it was me who said that , but I know it 's true . I know it would mean a great deal to her . ' He said , What 's going on here ? You told me clearly that it was Fiona who said that . ' I said , I never told you any such thing ! Or at least I do n't think I did ; unless maybe perhaps by accident I  --  ' He said , Are you saying she did n't ask for me ? '  |p205Well  , I just know she would have , ' I told him , if the two of you were not so all-fired careful of your dignity . I just know she wanted to , Jesse  --  ' But by then he was gone . Slammed out of the house and vanished , did not come home all Thursday night , and Friday we had to set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were disappointed ! " Fiona said . " You had promised you would be bringing him . I waited , I dressed up , I got myself a make-over at the beauty parlor . Then you turn into the driveway and he 's not with you . " " Well , I told him when we got home , " Maggie said , " I told him , We tried our best , Jesse , but it was n't us Fiona dressed up for , you can be certain . It was you , and you should have seen her face when you did n't get out of the car . ' " Fiona slapped a sofa cushion with the flat of her palm . She said , " I might have known you would do that . " " Do what ? " " Oh , make me look pitiful in front of Jesse . " " I did n't make you look pitiful ! I merely said  --  " " So then he calls me on the phone . I knew that was why he called me . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his voice that he was sorry for me . I knew what you must have told him . I say , What do you want ? Are you calling for a reason ? ' He says , No , urn , no reason . . . ' I say , Well , then , you 're wasting your money , are n't you ? ' and I hang up . " " Fiona , for Lord 's sake , " Maggie said . " Did n't it occur to you he might have called because he missed you ? " Fiona said , " Ha ! " and took another swig of beer . " I wish you could have seen him the way I saw him , " Maggie said . " After you left , I mean . He was a wreck ! A shambles . His most cherished belonging was your tortoiseshell soapbox . " " My what ? " " Do n't you remember your soapbox , the one with the tortoiseshelllid ? " " Well , yes . "  | " He would open it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I saw him ! I promise ! The day you left , that evening , I found Jesse in the bedroom with his nose buried deep in your soapbox and his eyes closed . " " Well , what in the world ? " Fiona said . " I believe he must have inherited some of my sense of smell , " Maggie told her . " You 're talking about that little plastic box . The one I used to keep my face soap in . " " Then as soon as he saw me he hid it behind his back , " Maggie said . " He was embarrassed I had caught him . He always liked to act so devil-may-care ; you know how he acted . But a few days later , when your sister came for your things , I could n't find your soapbox anywhere . She was packing up your cosmetic case , is how I happened to think of it , so I said , Let 's see , now , somewhere around . . . ' but that soapbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse because he had walked out as soon as your sister walked in , so I started opening his bureau drawers and that 's where I found it , in his treasure drawer among the things he never throws away  --  his old-time baseball cards and the clippings about his band . But I did n't give it to your sister . I just shut the drawer again . In fact , I believe he has kept that soapbox to this day , Fiona , and you ca n't tell me it 's because he feels sorry for you . He wants to remember you . He goes by smell , just the way I do ; smell is what brings a person most clearly to his mind . " Fiona gazed down at her beer can . That eye shadow was oddly attractive , Maggie realized . Sort of peach-like . It gave her lids a peach 's pink blush . " Does he still look the same ? " Fiona asked finally . " The same ? " " Does he still look like he used to ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh.  |p207There  was a moment of quiet , during which Leroy said , " Durn ! Missed . " A car passed , trailing threads of country music . I 've had some bad times , lived through some sad times .. . " You know , " Fiona said , " there 's nights when I wake up and think , How could things have gotten so twisted ? They started out perfectly simple . He was just this boy I was crazy about and followed anyplace his band played , and everything was so straightforward . When he did n't notice me at first , I sent him a telegram , did he ever mention that ? Fiona Stuckey would like to go with you to Deep Creek Lake , that 's what it said , because I knew he was planning to drive there with his friends . And so he took me along , and that 's where it all began . Was n't that straightforward ? But then , I do n't know , everything sort of folded over on itself and knotted up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's times I think , Shoot , maybe I ought to just fire off another telegram . Jesse , I 'd say , I love you still , and it begins to seem I always will . He would n't even have to answer ; it 's just something I want him to know . Or I 'll be down in Baltimore at my sister 's and I 'll think , Why not drop by and visit him ? Just walk in on him ? Just see what happens ? " " Oh , you ought to , " Maggie said . " But he 'd say , What are you doing here ? ' Or some such thing . I mean it 's bound and determined to go wrong . The whole cycle would just start over again . " " Oh , Fiona , is n't it time somebody broke that cycle ? " Maggieasked . " Suppose he did say that ; not that I think he would . Could n't you for once stand your ground and say , I 'm here because I want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these hurt feelings and these misunderstandings . Say , ' I 'm here because I 've missed you . So there ! ' " " Well , maybe I should do that , " Fiona said slowly . " Of course you should . " " Maybe I should ride back down with you . " " With us ? "  | " Or maybe not . " " You 're talking about . . . this afternoon ? " " No , maybe not ; what am I saying ? Oh , Lord . I knew I should n't drink in the daytime ; it always makes my head so muzzy " But that 's a wonderful idea ! " Maggie said . " Well , if Leroy came with me , for instance ; if we just made a little visit . I mean visiting you two , not Jesse . After all , you 're Leroy 's grandparents , right ? What could be more natural ? And then spent the night at my sister 's place  --  " " No , not at your sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house . " There was a crunch of gravel outside  --  the sound of a car rolling up . Maggie tensed , but Fiona did n't seem to hear . " And then tomorrow after lunch we could catch the Greyhound bus , " she was saying , " or let 's see , midafternoon at the latest . The next day 's a working day and Leroy has school , of course  --  " A car door clunked shut . A high , complaining voice called , " Leroy ? " Fiona straightened . " Mom , " she said , looking uneasy . The voice said , " Who 's that you got with you , Leroy ? " And then , " Why . Mr. Moran . " What Ira answered , Maggie had no idea . All that filtered through the venetian blinds was a brief rumble . " My , my , " Mrs. Stuckey said . " Is n't this . . . " something or other . " It 's Mom , " Fiona told Maggie . " Oh , how nice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie said unhappily . " She is going to have a fit . " " A fit ? " " She would kill me if I was to go and visit you . " Maggie did n't like the uncertain sound of that verb construction . The screen door opened and Mrs. Stuckey plodded in  --  ap209gray , scratchy-haired woman wearing a ruffled sundress . She was lugging two beige plastic shopping bags , and a cigarette drooped from her colorless , cracked lips . Oh , Maggie had never understood how such a woman could have given birth to Fiona  --  finespun Fiona . Mrs. Stuckey set the bags in the center of the shag rug . Even then , she did n't glance up . " One thing I despise , " she said , removing her cigarette , " is these new-style plastic grocery bags with the handles that cut your fingers in half . " " How are you , Mrs. Stuckey ? " Maggie asked . " Also they fall over in the car trunk and spill their guts out , " Mrs. Stuckey said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We just stopped by for a second , " Maggie said . " We had to go to a funeral in Deer Lick . " " Hmm , " Mrs. Stuckey said . She took a drag of her cigarette . She held it like a foreigner , pinched between her thumb and her index finger . If she had calculated outright , she could not have chosen a more unbecoming dress . It completely exposed her upper arms , which were splotched and doughy . Maggie waited for Fiona to mention the trip to Baltimore , but Fiona was fiddling with her largest turquoise ring . She slid it up past her first knuckle , twisted it , and slid it down again . So Maggie had to be the one . She said , " I 've been trying to talk Fiona into coming home with us for a visit . " " Fat chance of that , " Mrs. Stuckey said . Maggie looked over at Fiona . Fiona went on fiddling with her ring . " Well , she 's thinking she might do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cigarette to glare at the long tube of ash at its tip . Then she stubbed it out in the rowboat , perilously close to the yellow sponge . A strand of smoke wound toward Maggie . " Me and Leroy might go just for the weekend , " Fiona said faintly . " For the what ? "  | " For the weekend . " Mrs. Stuckey stooped for the grocery bags and started wading out of the room , bending slightly at the knees so her arms looked too long for her body . At the door she said , " I 'd sooner see you lying in your casket . " " But , Mom ! " Fiona was on her feet now , following her into the hallway . She said , " Mom , the weekend 's half finished anyhow . We 're talking about just one single night ! One night at Leroy 's grandparents ' house . " " And Jesse Moran would be nowhere about , I suppose , " Mrs. Stuckey said at a distance . There was a crash  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Jesse might be around maybe , but  --  " " Yah , yah , " Mrs. Stuckey said on an outward breath . " Besides , so what if he is ? Do n't you think Leroy should get to know her daddy ? " Mrs. Stuckey 's answer to that was just a mutter , but Maggie heard it clearly . " Anyone whose daddy is Jesse Moran is better off staying strangers . " Well ! Maggie felt her face grow hot . She had half a mind to march out to the kitchen and give Mrs. Stuckey what for . " Listen , " she would say . " You think there have n't been times I 've cursed your daughter ? She hurt my son to the bone . There were times I could have wrung her neck , but have you ever heard me speak a word against her ? " In fact , she even stood up , with a sudden , violent motion that creaked the sofa springs , but then she paused . She smoothed down the front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and instead of heading for the kitchen she collected her purse and went off to find a bathroom , clamping her lips very tightly . Please , God , do n't let the bathroom lie on the other side of the kitchen . No , there it was  --  the one open door at the end of the hall . She caught the watery green of a shower curtain.  |p211After  she had used the toilet , she turned on the sink faucet and patted her cheeks with cool water . She bent closer to the mirror . Yes , definitely she had a flustered look . She would have to get hold of herself . She had n't finished even that one beer , but she thought it might be affecting her . And it was essential just now to play her cards right . For instance , about Jesse . Although she had failed to mention it to Fiona , Jesse lived in an apartment uptown now , and therefore they could n't merely assume that he would happen by while Fiona was visiting . He would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other plans . Saturday : That could mean trouble . She checked her watch . Saturday night he might very well be singing with his band , or just going out with his friends . Sometimes he even dated  --  no one important , but still .. . She flushed the toilet , and under cover of the sound she slipped out of the bathroom and opened the door next to it . This room must be Leroy 's . Dirty clothes and comic books lay everywhere . She closed the door again and tried the one opposite . Ah , a grownup 's room . A decorous white candlewick bedspread , and a telephone on the nightstand . " After all you done to free yourself , you want to go back to that boy and get snaggled up messy as ever , " Mrs. Stuckey said , clattering tin cans . " Who says I 'm getting snaggled ? I 'm just paying a weekend visit . " " He 'll have you running circles around him just like you was before . " " Mom , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snippet I used to be . " Maggie closed the door soundlessly behind her and went over to lift the receiver . Oh , dear , no push buttons . She winced each time the dial made its noisy , rasping return to home base . The voices in the kitchen continued , though . She relaxed and pressed the receiver to her ear.  |p212One  ring . Two rings . It was a good thing Jesse was working today . For the last couple of weeks , the phone in his apartment had not been ringing properly . He could call other people all right , but he never knew when someone might be calling him . " Why do n't you get it fixed ? Or buy a new one ; they 're dirt cheap these days , " Maggie had said , but he said , " Oh , I do n't know , it 's kind of a gas . Anytime I pass the phone I just pick it up at random . I say , Hello ? ' Twice I 've actually found a person on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering that . There was something so . . . oh , so lucky about Jesse . He was so fortunate and funny and haphazard . " Chick 's Cycle Shop , " a boy said . " Could I speak to Jesse , please ? " The receiver at the other end clattered unceremoniously against a hard surface . " Jess ! " the boy called , moving off . There was a silence , overlaid by the hissing sound of long distance . Of course this was stealing , if you wanted to get picky about it using someone else 's phone to call out of state . Maybe she ought to leave a couple of quarters on the nightstand . Or would that be considered an insult ? With Mrs. Stuckey , there was no right way to do a thing . Jesse said , " Hello . " " Jesse ? " " Ma ? " His voice was Ira 's voice , but years younger . " Jesse , I ca n't talk long , " she whispered . " What ? Speak up , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " What ? " She cupped the mouthpiece with her free hand . " I was wondering , " she said . " Do you think you could come to supper tonight ? " " Tonight ? Well , I was sort of planning on  --  "  | " It 's important , " she said . " How come ? " " Well , it just is , " she said , playing for time . She had a decision to make , here . She could pretend it was on Daisy 's account , for Daisy 's going away . ( That was safe enough . In spite of their childhood squabbles he was fond of Daisy , and had asked her only last week whether she would forget him after she left . ) Or she could tell him the truth , in which case she might set in motion another of those ridiculous scenes . But had n't she just been saying it was time to cut through all that ? She took a deep breath . She said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're what ? " " Do n't hang up ! Do n't say no ! This is your only daughter ! " she cried in a rush . And then glanced anxiously toward the door , fearing she 'd been too loud . " Now , slow down , Ma , " Jesse said . " Well , we 're up here in Pennsylvania , " she said more quietly , " because we happened to be going to a funeral . Max Gill died  --  I do n't know if Daisy 's had a chance to tell you . And considering that we were in the neighborhood . . . and Fiona told me in so many words that she wanted very much to see you . " Oh , Ma . Is this going to be like those other times ? " " What other times ? " " Is this like when you said she phoned and I believed you and phoned her back  --  " " She did phone then ! I swear it ! " " Somebody phoned , but you had no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that part , did you ? " Maggie said , " The telephone rang , I picked it up . I said ,  |p214Hello  ? ' No answer . It was just a few months after she left ; who else could it have been ? I said , Fiona ? ' She hung up . If it was n't Fiona , why did she hang up ? " " Then all you tell me is : Jesse , Fiona called today , ' and I break my neck getting to the phone and make a total fool of myself . I say , Fiona ? What did you want ? ' and she says , To whom am I speaking , please ? ' I say , Goddamn it , Fiona , you know perfectly well this is Jesse , ' and she says , Do n't you use that language with me , Jesse Moran , ' and I say , Now , look here . It was n't me who called you , may I remind you , ' and she says , But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , are n't you , ' and I say , But goddamn it  --  ' " " Jesse , " Maggie said , " Fiona says she sometimes thinks of sending you another telegram . " " Telegram ? " " Like the first one . You remember the first one . " " Yes , " Jesse said . " I remember . " " You never told me about that . But at any rate , " she hurried on , " the telegram would read , Jesse , I love you still , and it begins to seem I always will . " A moment passed . Then he said , " You just do n't quit , do you ? " " You think I 'd make such a thing up ? " " If she really wanted to send it , then what stopped her ? " he asked . " Why did n't I ever get it ? Hmm ? " " How could I make it up when I did n't even know about the first one , Jesse ? Answer me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm able to tell you exactly how she worded it . I remember because it was one of those unintentional rhymes . You know the way things can rhyme when you do n't want them to . It 's so ironic , because if you did want them to , you 'd have to rack your brain for days and comb through special dictionaries . . . . " She was babbling whatever came to mind , just to give Jessep215time to assemble a response . Was there ever anyone so scared of losing face ? Not counting Fiona , of course . Then she imagined she heard some change in the tone of his silence  --  a progression from flat disbelief to something less certain . She let her voice trail off . She waited . " If I did happen to come , " he said finally , " what time would you be serving supper ? " " You 'll do it ? You will ? Oh , Jesse , I 'm so glad ! Let 's say six-thirty , " she told him . " Bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some further , more resistant stage . She stood beside the bed a moment . In the front yard , Ira called , " Whoa , there ! " She picked up her purse and left the room . Fiona was kneeling in the hallway , rooting through the bottom of a closet . She pulled out a pair of galoshes and threw them aside . She reached in again and pulled out a canvas tote bag . " Well , I talked to Jesse , " Maggie told her . Fiona froze . The tote bag was suspended in midair . " He 's really pleased you 're coming , " Maggie said . " Did he say that ? " Fiona asked . " He certainly did . " " I mean in so many words ? " Maggie swallowed . " No , " she said , because if there was a cycle to be broken here , she herself had had some part in it ; she knew that . She said , " He just told me he 'd be there for supper . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied her doubtfully . " He said , I ' 11 be there ! ' " Maggie told her . Silence . " I ' 11 be there right after work , Ma ! You can count on me ! ' " Maggie said . " Goddamn ! I would n't miss it for the world ! ' " " Well , " Fiona said finally . Then she unzipped the tote bag.  | " If I were traveling alone I 'd make do with just a toothbrush , " she told Maggie . " But once you 've got a kid , you know how it is . Pajamas , comics , storybooks , coloring books for the car . . . and she has to have her baseball glove , her everlasting baseball glove . You never know when you might rustle up a game , she says . " " No , that 's true , you never do , " Maggie said , and she laughed out loud for sheer happiness.  |p217Ira  had a way , when he was truly astonished , of getting his face sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be angry , but no , he just took a step backward and stared at her and then his face locked , blank and flat like something carved of hardwood . He said , " Fiona 's what ? " " She 's coming for a visit , " Maggie said . " Wo n't that be nice ? " No reaction . " Fiona and Leroy , both , " Maggie told him . Still no reaction . Maybe it would have been better if he 'd got angry . She moved past him , keeping her smile . " Leroy , honey , your mother wants you , " she called . " She needs you to help her pack . " Leroy was less easily surprised than Ira , evidently . She said , " Oh . Okay , " and give the Frisbee an expert flip in Ira 's direction before skipping toward the house . The Frisbee ricocheted off Ira 's left knee and landed in the dirt . He gazed down at it absently . " We should have cleaned the car out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known we would be riding so many passengers today ... " She went over to the Dodge , which was blocked now by a red Maverick that must be Mrs. Stuckey 's . You could tell the Dodge had recently traveled some distance . It had a beatendown , dusty look . She opened a rear door and tsked . A stack of library books slumped across the back seat , and a crocheted sweater that she had been hunting for days lay there all squinched and creased , no doubt from being sat upon by Otis . The floor was cobbled with cloudy plastic lids from soft-drink cups . She reached in to gather the books  --  major , important novels by Dostoevsky and Thomas Mann . She had checked them out in a surge of good intentions at the start of the summer and was returning them unread and seriously overdue . " Open the trunk , will you ? " she asked Ira . He moved slowly toward the trunk and opened it , not changinghis expression . She dumped in the books and went back for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her . " Well , we were discussing her soapbox , see , and  --  " " Her what ? I mean it came about so quickly . So all of a sudden . I leave you alone for a little game of Frisbee and the next thing I know you 're out here with beer on your breath and a whole bunch of unexpected houseguests . " " Why , Ira , I would think you 'd be glad , " she told him . She folded the sweater and laid it in the trunk . " But it 's like the second I shut the door behind me , you two got down to business , " he said . " How do you accomplish these things ? " Maggie started collecting soft-drink lids from the floor of the car . " You can close the trunk now , " she told him . She carried a fistful of lids around to the rear of the house and dropped them in a crumpled garbage can . The cover was only a token cover , a battered metal beret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's siding was speckled withp219mildew , and rust stains trailed from a fuel tank affixed beneath the window . " How long will they be staying ? " Ira asked when she returned . " Just till tomorrow . " " We have to take Daisy to college tomorrow , did you forget ? " " No , I did n't forget . " " Aha , " he said . " Your fiendish plot : Throw Jesse and Fionatogether on their own . I know you , Maggie Moran . " " You do n't necessarily know me at all , " she told him . If things went the way she hoped they would this evening , she would have no need of plots for tomorrow . She opened the front door on her side of the Dodge and sank onto the seat . Inside , the car was stifling . She blotted her upper lip on the hem of her skirt . " So how do we present this ? " Ira asked . " Surprise , surprise , Jesse boy ! Here 's your ex-wife , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted company years ago ; we 've decided you 're getting back together now . ' " " Well , for your information , " she said , " I 've already toldhim they 're coming , and he 'll be at our house for supper . " Ira bent to look in on her . He said , " You told him ? " " Right . " " How ? " he asked . " By phone , of course . " " You phoned him ? You mean just now ? " " Right . " " And he 'll be there for supper ? " " Right . " He straightened up and leaned against the car . " I do n't get it , " he said finally . " What 's to get ? " " There 's something too simple about it . " All she could see of him was his midsection  --  a hollow/looking white shirt wilting over a belt . Would n't he be baking ? This metal must radiate heat like a flatiron . Although it was true that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less direct , already starting to slip behind a faraway scribble of trees . " I 'm worried about that Maverick , " she said , speaking to Ira 's belt buckle . " Hmm ? " " Mrs. Stuckey 's Maverick . I 'd hate to ask her to move it , and I 'm not sure we have room to get around it . " That caught him , as she 'd guessed it would  --  a question of logistics . He left , abruptly ; she felt the car rock . He wandered off to check the Maverick 's position , and Maggie tipped her head back against the seat and closed her eyes . Why was Ira so negative about Jesse ? Why did he always have that skeptical twist to his voice when he discussed him ? Oh , Jesse was n't perfect good heavens , no  --  but he had all kinds of endearing qualities . He was so generous and affectionate . And if he lost his temper easily , why , he regained it easily too , and had never been known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say for Ira . Was it plain old envy  --  a burdened , restrained man 's envy of someone who was constitutionally carefree ? When Jesse was just a baby Ira was always saying , " Do n't pick him up every time he cries . Do n't feed him every time he 's hungry . You 'll spoil him . " " Spoil him ? " Maggie had asked . " Feeding him when he 's hungry is spoiling him ? That 's nonsense . " But she had sounded more confident than she 'd felt . Was she spoiling him ? This was her very first experience with an infant . She had been the youngest in her family and never had the casual contact with babies that some of her friends had had . And Jesse was such a puzzling baby  --  colicky , at the start , giving no hint of the merry little boy he would later turn out to be.  |p221He  had flown into tiny , red-faced rages for no apparent reason in the middle of the night . Maggie had had to walk him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room table . Was it possible , she had wondered , that this baby just plain did n't like her ? Where was it written that a child was always compatible with his parents ? When you thought about it , it was amazing that so many families got along as well as they did . All they had to rely on was luck  --  the proper personality genes turning up like dice . And in Jesse 's case , maybe the luck had been poor . She felt he was chafing against his parents . They were too narrow , too sedate , too conservative . Once , carrying a squalling Jesse down the aisle of a city bus , Maggie had been surprised to feel him suddenly relax in her arms . He had hushed , and she had looked at his face . He was staring at a dressed-up blonde in one of the seats . He started smiling at her . He held out his arms . His kind of person , at last ! Unfortunately , though , the blonde was reading a magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then the minute he discovered other children  --  all of whom instantly loved him  --  why , he hit the streets running and was hardly seen at home anymore . But that , too , Ira found fault with , for Jesse missed his curfews , forgot to appear for dinner , neglected his schoolwork in favor of a pickup basketball game in the alley . Mr. Moment-by-Moment , Ira used to call him . And Maggie had to admit the name was justified . Were some people simply born without the ability to link one moment to the next ? If so , then Jesse was one of them : a disbeliever in consequences , mystified by others ' habit of holding against him things that had happened , why , hours ago ! days ago ! way last week , even ! He was genuinely perplexed that someone could stay angry at something he himself had immediately forgotten . Once when he was eleven or twelve he 'd been horsing around with Maggie in the kitchen , punching his catcher 's mitt while he teased her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Huh ? Mr. Bunch ? " Mr. Bunch was his sixth-grade teacher , so Maggie assumed the call was for Jesse and she turned back to her work . Jesse said , " Huh ? " He said , " Wait a minute ! You ca n't blame me for that ! " Then he slammed the phone down , and Maggie , glancing over , saw those telltale dark rings beneath his eyes . " Jesse ? Honey ? What 's the matter ? " she had asked . " Nothing , " he told her roughly , and he walked out . He left his catcher 's mitt on the table , worn and deeply pocketed and curiously alive . The kitchen echoed . But not ten minutes later she noticed him in the front yard with Herbie Albright , laughing uproariously , crashing through the little boxwood hedge as he 'd been told not to a hundred times . Yes , it was his laughter that she pictured when she thought of him  --  his eyes lit up and dancing , his teeth very white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of his throat . ( And why was it that Maggie remembered the laughter while Ira remembered the tantrums ? ) In a family very nearly without a social life , Jesse was intensely , almost ridiculously social , knee deep in friends . Classmates came home with him from school every afternoon , and sometimes as many as seven or eight stayed over on weekends , their sleeping bags taking up all the floor space in his room , their cast-off jackets and six-guns and model airplane parts spilling out into the hallway . In the morning when Maggie went to wake them for pancakes the musky , wild smell of boy hung in the doorway like curtains , and she would blink and back off and return to the safety of the kitchen , where little Daisy , swathed to her toes in one of Maggie 's aprons , stood on a chair earnestly stirring batter . He took up running one spring and ran like a maniac , throwing himself into it the way he did with everything that interested him , however briefly . This was when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sometimes asked Maggie for a lift to his favorite track , the Ralston School 's cedar-chip/carpeted oval in the woods out in Baltimore County . Maggie would wait for him in the car , reading a library book and glancingup from time to time to check his progress . She could always spot him , even when the track was crowded with middle-aged ladies in sweat suits and Ralston boys in numbered uniforms . Jesse wore tattered jeans and a black T-shirt with the sleeves ripped off , but it was n't only his clothes that identified him ; it was his distinctive style of running . His gait was free and open , as if he were holding nothing in reserve for the next lap . His legs flew out and his arms made long reaching motions , pulling in handfuls of the air in front of him . Every time Maggie located him , her heart would pinch with love . Then he would vanish into the forested end of the track and she would go back to her book . But one day he did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't appear . And yet the others came , even the slowest , even the silly-looking Swedish-walker people with their elbows pumping like chicken wings . She got out of the car finally and went over to the track , shading her eyes . No Jesse . She followed the bend of the oval into the woods , her crepe-soled work shoes sinking into the cedar chips so her calf muscles felt weighted . People pounded past her , glancing over momentarily , giving her the impression they were leaving their faces behind . In the woods to her left , she noticed a flash of white . It was a girl in a white shirt and shorts , lying on her back in the leaves , and Jesse was lying on top of her . He was fully clothed but , yes , smack on top of her , and the girl 's white arms were twined around his neck . " Jesse , I have to be getting home soon , " Maggiecalled . Then she turned and walked back toward the car , feeling plain and clumsy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtook her and sped past , his amazingly long gym shoes landing deftly , plop-plop , and his muscular brown arms scooping the air . So then it was girls , girls , girls  --  a jostling parade of girls ,  |p224all  of them fair and slender and pretty , with soft , unformed faces and a tidy style of dressing . They called him on the phone and sent letters reeking of perfume and sometimes simply arrived on the doorstep , treating Maggie with a deference that made her feel ancient . They paid her vivacious compliments  --  " Oh , Mrs. Moran , I love that blouse ! "  --  meanwhile searching behind her for Jesse . Maggie had to fight down the urge to bristle , to bar their entrance . Who would know better than she how deviouslygirls could behave ? Why , a boy did n't stand a chance ! But then Jesse would saunter out , not even rearranging his face at the sight of them , making no effort whatsoever , his T-shirt giving off the yeasty smell of fresh sweat and his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perkiness , and Maggie knew it was they who did n't stand a chance . She felt rueful and proud , both . She was ashamed of herself for feeling proud , and to make up for it she acted especially kind to every girl who came . Sometimes she acted so kind that the girls continued to visit her for months after Jesse had dropped them . " They 'd sit in the kitchen and confide in her , not just about Jesse but about other things as well , problems with their parents and such . Maggie enjoyed that . Usually Daisy would be sitting there too , her head bent over her homework , and Maggie had the feeling they were all three part of a warm community of females , a community she had missed out on when she was growing up with her brothers . Was it about that time that the music began ? Loud music , with a hammering beat . One day it just flooded the house , as if Jesse 's turning adolescent had opened a door through which the drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck into the kitchen for a sandwich and the clock radio would start blaring out " Lyin ' Eyes . " Let him dash up to his room for his catcher 's mitt and his stereo would swing into " Afternoon Delight . " And of course he never turned anything off again , so long after he 'd left the house the music would stillp225be playing . Maybe he intended it that way . It was his signature , his footprint on their lives . " I 'll be out in the world now , but do n't forget me , " he was saying , and there they sat , two stodgy grownups and a prim little girl , while " When Will I Be Loved " jangled through the emptiness he left behind him . Then he stopped liking what his classmates liked and he claimed the Top Forty was dentist music , elevator music . ( " Oh , " Maggie said sadly , for she had enjoyed that music  --  or some of it , at least . ) The songs that filled the house grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sung by scroungy , beatnik-looking groups dressed in rags and tags and bits of military uniforms . ( Meanwhile the old albums filtered downstairs to line the shelf beneath the living room hi-fi , each new stage Jesse entered adding to Maggie 's collection of castoffs , which she sometimes played secretly when she was all alone in the house . ) And then he started writing his own songs , with peculiar modern names like " Microwave Quartet " and " Cassette RecorderBlues . " A few of these he sang for Maggie when Ira was n't around . He had a nasal , deadpan style of singing that was more like talking . To Maggie it sounded very professional , very much like what you might hear on the radio , but then , of course , she was only his mother . Although his friends were impressed , too ; she knew that . His friend Don Burnham , whose second cousin had come this close to being hired as a roadie for the Ramones , said Jesse was good enough to form a group of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly nice , well-raised boy who had transferred to Jesse 's school at the start of eleventh grade . When Jesse first brought him home , Don had made conversation with Maggie ( not something you would take for granted , in a boy that age ) and sat politely through Daisy 's exhibit of her state-capitals postcard collection . " Next time I come , " he 'd told Maggie out of the blue , " I 'll bring you myp226Doonesbury scrapbook . " Maggie had said , " Oh , why , I 'll look forward to that . " But the next time he came he had his acoustic guitar along , and Jesse sang one of his songs for him while Don strummed beneath it . Seems like this old world is on fast forward nowadays . . . Then Don told Jesse he ought to sing in public , and from that moment ever afterward ( or so it seemed in retrospect ) , Jesse was gone . He formed a band called Spin the Cat  --  he and a bunch of older boys , high-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found them . He began to dress more heavily , as if for combat ; he wore black denim shirts and black jeans and crumpled leather motorcycle boots . He came in at all hours smelling of beer and tobacco or , who knows , maybe worse than tobacco . He developed a following of a whole new type of girl , crisper and flashier , who did n't bother making up to Maggie or sitting in her kitchen . And in the spring it emerged that he had n't attended school in some time , and would not be promotedfrom junior year to senior . Seventeen and a half years old and he 'd thrown away his future , Ira said , all for a single friendship . Never mind that Don Burnham was n't even part of Jesse 's band , and had passed smoothly on to senior year himself . In Ira 's version of things , Don 's one piece of advice had landed with a ping ! and life had never been the same again . Don was some kind of providential instrument , fate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up or ship out , Ira told Jesse . Earn the missing credits in summer school , or otherwise find a job and move to his own apartment . Jesse said he 'd had a bellyful of school . He would be glad to get a job , he said , and he could n't wait to move to his own apartment , where he could come and go as he pleased , with nobody breathing down his neck . Ira said , " Good riddance , " and went upstairs without another word . Jesse left the house , tramping across the porch in his motorcycle boots . Maggiestarted crying.  |p227How  could Ira imagine Jesse 's life ? Ira was one of those people who are born competent . Everything came easy to him . There was no way he could fully realize how Jesse used to feel plodding off to school every morning  --  his shoulders already hunched against defeat , his jacket collar standing up crooked , and his hands shoved deep in his pockets . What it must be like to be Jesse ! To have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infallible ! Really his only saving grace was his mother , his harum-scarum klutzy mother , Maggie said to herself . She was making one of her wry private jokes but she meant it , all the same . And she wished he 'd taken more from her . Her ability to see the best in things , for instance . Her knack for accepting , for adapting . But no . Slit-eyed and wary , all his old light-heartedness gone , Jesse prowled the city in search of work . He was hoping for a job in a record store . He did n't even have pocket money ( at this point that band of his still played for free  --  for the " exposure , " was how they put it ) and was forced to borrow bus fare from Maggie . And each day he came back glummer than the day before , and each evening he and Ira fought . " If you showed up for your interviews dressed like a normal person  --  " Ira told him . " A place puts that much stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow , " Jesse said . " Fine , then you 'd better learn how to dig ditches , because that 's the only job where they do n't put stock in appearance . " Then Jesse would slam out of the house once again , and how flat things seemed after he left ! How shallow , how lacking in spirit ! Maggie and Ira gazed at each other bleakly across the living room . Maggie blamed Ira ; he was too harsh . Ira blamed Maggie ; she was too soft . Sometimes , deep down inside , Maggie blamed herself too . She saw now that there was a single theme to every decision she had made as a parent : The mere fact that her children werep228children , condemned for years to feel powerless and bewildered and confined , filled her with such pity that to add any further hardship to their lives seemed unthinkable . She could excuse anything in them , forgive them everything . She would have made a better mother , perhaps , if she had n't remembered so well how it felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead  --  that in fact he had died years ago , back when he was still a sunny , prankish little boy , and she had somehow failed to realize it . She dreamed she was sobbing uncontrollably ; there was no way to survive such a loss . Then she saw in the crowd on deck ( for she was taking a boat trip , all at once ) a child who resembled Jesse , standing with his parents , whom she had never seen before . He glanced over at her and looked quickly away , but she could tell that he thought she seemed familiar . She smiled at him . He glanced at her again and then looked away again . She edged a few inches closer , meanwhile pretending to study the horizon . He had come back to life in another family ; that was how she explained it to herself . He was n't hers now , but never mind , she would start over . She would win him to her side . She felt his eyes alight on her once more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half not ; and she knew it meant that underneath , he and she would always love each other . Now , at this point Daisy was nine years old , or just about to turn nine  --  enough of a child still , you would think , to keep Maggie fully occupied . But the fact was that at that very moment , Daisy took it into her head to start growing away too . She had always been a bit precocious . In her infancy Ira had called her Lady-Baby , because she was so mature and reserved , her small face a knot of opinion . At thirteen months she had undertaken her own toilet training . In first grade she had set her alarm for an hour earlier than anyone else in the household and slipped downstairs each morning to sort through the launderedclothes for a proper outfit . ( She could iron better thanp229Maggie even then , and liked to look neat as a pin and colorcoordinated . ) And now she seemed to have leapt ahead to that stage where the outside world took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like-minded friends , including one , LaviniaMurphy , whose mother was perfect . Perfect Mrs. Murphy headed the PTA and the Bake Sale and ( since she did n't work ) was free to drive the little girls to every kind of cultural event , and she hosted wonderful slumber parties , with treasure hunts . The spring of ' 78 , Daisy practically lived with the Murphys . Maggie would come home from work and call , " Daisy ? " but all she found was a silent house and a note on the front-hall bookshelf . Then one afternoon the house was n't silent after all but murmury and conspiratorial , she could sense it the moment she entered , and upstairs , Jesse 's bedroom door was closed . She knocked . After a startled pause , Jesse called , " Just a second . " She heard rustles and whispers . When he came out he had a girl in tow . Her long blond hair was rumpled and her lips had a bruised look . She sidled past Maggie with her eyes downcast and descended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she heard Jesse saying goodbye in a low voice . As soon as he came back upstairs ( unashamedly heading straight to Maggie ) , she told him that the mother of that girl , whoever she was , would be horrified to know her daughter had been alone with a boy in his bedroom . Jesse said , " Oh , no , her mom lives in Pennsylvania somewhere . Fiona stays with her sister , and her sister does n't mind . " " Well , I do , " Maggie said . Jesse did n't argue with that , and the girl stopped coming around . Or at least she was out of sight when Maggie returned from work each day . Though Maggie had a feeling ; she picked up certain clues . She noticed that Jesse was gone more than ever , that he returned abstracted , that his brief spells at home were marked by long private conversations on the upstairs tele/phone and it was always the same girl 's voice  --  soft and questioning  --  whenMaggie happened to lift the receiver . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do with shipping , and started looking for an apartment . The only trouble was , the rents were so high and his paycheck was so puny . Good , Ira said . Now maybe he would have to face a few hard facts . Maggie wished Ira would just shut up . " Do n't worry , " she told Jesse . " Something will come along . " That was toward the end of June . In July he was still living at home . And one Wednesday evening in August , he caught Maggie alone in the kitchen and informed her , very calmly and directly , that he seemed to have got this girl he knew in trouble . The air in the room grew oddly still . Maggie wiped her hands on her apron . She said , " Is it that Fiona person ? " He nodded . " So now what ? " Maggie asked . She was as cool as he was ; she surprised herself . This seemed to be happening to someone else . Or maybe she had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been heading their way all along , like a glacier bearing down on them . " Well , " Jesse said , " that 's what I needed to discuss with you . I mean , what I want and what she wants are two different things . " " What is it you want ? " Maggie asked , thinking she knew . " I want her to keep the baby . " For a moment , that did n't register . Even the word itself  --  " baby "  --  seemed incongruous on Jesse 's lips . It seemed almost , in an awful way , cute . She said , " Keep it ? " " I thought I 'd start hunting an apartment for the three of us . " You mean get married ? " " Right . "  | " But you 're not even eighteen years old , " Maggie said . " And I bet the girl is n't , either . You 're too young . " " My birthday 's in two weeks , Ma , and Fiona 's is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; half the time she skips class and hangs out with me instead . Besides , I 've always looked forward to having a kid . It 's exactly what I 've been needing : something of my own . " " Something of your own ? " " I 'll just have to find a better-paying job , is all . " " Jesse , you 've got a whole family of your own ! What are you talking about ? " " But it 's not the same , " Jesse said . " I 've just never felt .. . I do n't know . So anyhow , I 've been looking for a job that pays more money . See , a baby takes a lot of equipment and such . I 've written down a list from Dr. Spock . " Maggie stared at him . The only question she could come up with was : " Where on earth did you get hold of a Dr. Spock ? " " At the bookstore ; where else ? " " You went into a bookstore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That seemed the biggest surprise of all . She could n't pictureit . " I 've learned a lot , " he told her . " I think Fiona ought to breast-feed . " " Jesse  --  " " I found these plans in Home Hobby journal for building a cradle . " " Honey , you do n't know how hard it is . You 're children yourselves ! You ca n't take on a baby . " " I 'm asking you , Ma . I 'm serious , " Jesse said . And he did have that sharply etched look to his lips that he always got when he felt strongly about something . " But just what are you asking me ? " Maggie said . " I want you to go and talk to Fiona . "  | " What ? Talk about what ? " " Tell her you think she should keep it . " " You mean she wants to put it up for adoption , " Maggie said . " Or else . . . urn . . . stop the pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but --  " " Which ? " Maggie asked . " The second thing . " " Ah . " " But she does n't really want that . I know she does n't , " he said . " It 's just that she 's so stubborn . She expects the worst of me , seems like . She takes it for granted I 'm going to , like , ditch her or something . Well , first off , she did n't even tell me about it  --  can you believe it ? Hid it from me ! Went through weeks of worrying and never breathed a hint of it even though she saw me every day , near about . And then when the test came out positive , what does she do ? Asks me for the money to get rid of the baby . I say , ' Iluh ? To do what ? Now , hold on a sec , ' I tell her . ' Are n't you skipping over a few of the usual steps here ? Whatever happened to " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we two going to settle on ? " Are n't you going to offer inc a chance ? ' I ask her . She says , ' Chance for what ? ' Well , what about marrige ? ' I ask her . ' What about me taking on my proper responsibilities , for God 's sake ? ' She says , ' Do n't do me any favors , Jesse Moran . ' I say , ' Favors ? You 're talking about my son , here . ' She says , ' Oh , I have no illusions '  --  that is how she talks when she gets on her high horse . ' I have no illusions , ' she says . ' I knew what you were when I first laid eyes on you . Footloose and fancy-free , ' she says , ' lead singer in a hard-rock band . You do n't have to explain yourself to me . ' I felt I 'd been , like , stenciled or something . I mean where did she get this picture of me ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . So I say , ' No , I will not give you the money ; no , sir , no way , ' and she says , ' I might have known to expect that '  --  purposely misunderstanding . I hate when peo/ple do that , purposely acting so wronged and martyred . I might have figured , ' she says , that I could n't count on you for the simplest little abortion fee . ' Says the word right out , kind of like she cracked the air with it ; I honestly could n't speak for a second . I say , Goddammit , Fiona  --  ' and she says , Oh , fine , great , just cuss at me too on top of everything else , ' and I say " Jesse . Honey , " Maggie said . She rubbed her left temple . She had a sense that she was losing track of some importantthread here . " I really think that if Fiona has made up her mind  --  " she said . " She 's got an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Whitside Avenue . Monday is her sister 's day off ; her sister 's going with her . See there ? She does n't invite me to go with her . And I have talked to her till I 'm blue in the face . There 's nothing more I can say . So here 's what I 'm asking : You be the one . You go to the clinic and stop her . " " Me ? " " You always get along so well with my girlfriends . You can do it ; I know you can . Tell her about my job . I 'm quitting at the envelope factory . I 've applied at this computer store , where they 'll train me to fix computers , pay me while I 'm learning . They said I have a good chance of getting hired . And also Dave in the band , his mother owns a house in Waverly near the stadium and the whole top floor 's an apartment that 'll be vacant by November , cheap as dirt , Dave says , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the baby sleep in a separate room from its parents ; I 've been reading up on that . You 'd be amazed how much I know ! I 've decided I 'm for pacifiers . Some people do n't like the looks of them , but if you give a baby a pacifier he wo n't suck his thumb later on . Also , it is absolutely not true that pacifiers push their front teeth out of line . " He had n't talked so much in months , but the sad part was that the more he talked , the younger he seemed . His hair wasp234tangled where he 'd run his fingers through it , and his body was all sharp angles as he tore around the kitchen . Maggie said , " Jesse , honey , I know you 're going to make a wonderful father someday , but the fact of the matter is , this really has to be the girl 's decision . It 's the girl who has to go through the pregnancy . " " Not alone , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would take care of her . I want to do this , Ma . " She did n't know what more to say , and Jesse must have realized that . He stopped his pacing . He stood squarely in front of her . He said , " Look . You 're my only hope . All I 'm asking is , you let her know how I feel . Then she can decide whichever way she likes . What could be the harm in that ? " " But why ca n't you let her know how you feel ? " Maggie said . " Do n't you think I 've tried ? I 've talked till I 'm blue in the face . But everything I say seems to come out wrong . She takes offense , I take offense ; we just get all tangled in knots , somehow . By now we 're used up . We 're worn down into the ground . " Well , she certainly knew what that felt like . " Could n't you just consider it ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility ? " " Oh , " she said , " the possibility , maybe ... " He said , " Yes ! That 's all I 'm asking ! Thanks , Ma . Thanks a million . " " But , Jesse  --  " " And you wo n't tell Dad yet , will you ? " " Well , not for the time being , " she said lamely . " You can picture what he would say , " he said . Then he gave her one of his quick hugs , and he was gone . For the next few days she felt troubled , indecisive . Examplescame to mind of Jesse 's fickleness  --  how ( like most boys his age ) he kept moving on to new stages and new enthusiasms , leavingthe old ones behind . You could n't leave a wife and baby behind !  |p235But  then other pictures came too : for instance , the year they 'd all got the flu except for Jesse , and he had had to take care of them . She had glimpsed him blurrily through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the bed and fed her a bowl of chicken soup , spoonful by spoonful , and when she fell asleep between swallows he had waited without complaint until she jerked awake , and then he fed her another spoonful . " You have n't forgotten , have you ? " Jesse asked now wheneverhe met up with her . And , " You wo n't go back on your promise , will you ? " " No , no . . . " she would say . And then , " What promise ? " What had she let herself in for , exactly ? He tucked a slip of paper into her palm one evening  --  an address on Whitside Avenue . The clinic , she supposed . She dropped it in her skirt pocket . She said , " Now you realize I ca n't  --  " But Jesse had already evaporated , dexterous as a cat burglar . Ira was in a good mood those days , because he 'd heard about the computer job . It had come through , as Jesse had foreseen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is more like it , " Ira told Maggie . " This is something with a future . And who knows ? Maybe after a bit he 'll decide to go back to school . I 'm sure they 'll want him to finish school before they promote him . " Maggie was quiet , thinking . She had to work on Saturday , so that kept her mind off things , but Sunday she sat a long time on the porch . It was a golden hot day and everyone seemed to be out walking infants . Carriages and strollers wheeled past , and men lunged by with babies in backpacks . Maggie wondered if a backpack was one of the pieces of equipment Jesse considered essential . She would bet it was . She cocked her head toward the house , listening . Ira was watching a ball game on TV and Daisy was away at Mrs. Perfect 's . Jesse was still asleep , having come in late from playing at a dance in Howard County . She 'd heard him climbp236the stairs a little after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I would put you on defrost .. . " Music is so different now , " she had said to Jesse once . " It used to be Love Me Forever ' and now it 's Help Me Make It Through the Night . ' " " Aw , Ma , " he had said , " do n't you get it ? In the old days they just hid it better . It was always Help Me Make It Through the Night . ' " A line came to her from a song that was popular back when Jesse was a little boy . I must think of a way , it went , tactfully , tentatively , into your heart .. . When Jesse was a little boy he liked to tell her stories while she cooked ; he seemed to believe she needed entertaining . " Once there was a lady who never fed her children anything but doughnuts , " he might begin , or , " Once there was a man who lived on top of a Ferris wheel . " All of his stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw that they had had in common the theme of joyousness , of the triumph of sheer fun over practicality . He strung one particular story out for weeks , something about a retarded father who bought an electric organ with the grocery money . The retarded part came from his aunt Dorrie , she supposed . But the way he told it , the father 's handicap was a kind of virtue . The father said , " What do we need food for anyhow ? I like better for my children to hear nice music . " Maggie laughed when she repeated the story to Ira , but Ira had n't seen the humor . He took offense first on Dorrie 's account ( he did n't like the word " retarded " ) and then on his own . Why was it the father who was retarded ? Why not the mother , was probably what he meant  --  much more realistic , given Maggie 's shortcomings . Or maybe he did n't mean that at all , but Maggie imagined he did , and it developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was born , it seemed now , always taking the same stances . Ira criticized ,  |p237Maggie  excused . Ira claimed that Jesse would n't keep a civil tongue in his head , refused to wipe that obstinate expression off his face , acted hopelessly inept when helping out at the shop . He just had to come into his own , Maggie said . For some it took longer than for others . " Decades longer ? " Ira asked . She said , " Have a little patience , Ira . " ( A switch . Ira was the one with the patience . Maggie was the rusher-in . ) How was it that she had never realized the power of the young back when she was young herself ? She saw it now as a missed opportunity . In her girlhood she 'd been so easily cowed ; she had n't dreamed that children were capable of setting up such storms in a family . She and Ira tried to keep their own storms private , but no doubt Jesse overheard at least a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more , as he entered his teens , it was to Maggie that he offered his few crumbs of conversation , while he grew steadily more distant from Ira . By the time he told her about the baby , Maggie felt fairly distant from Ira herself . They 'd been through too many arguments , rehashed the subject of Jesse too many thousand times . It was n't merely her promise that kept Maggie from telling Ira about the baby ; it was battle fatigue . Ira would hit the roof ! And rightly so , of course . But she thought of how Jesse had nudged her lips with the soup spoon , coaxing her to eat . Sometimes , at the height of her fever , she had wakened to hear thin , sad , faraway music emerging from the earphones on his head , and she had been convinced that they were the sounds of his innermost thoughts made clear to her at long last . Monday morning she went to work as usual at seven but begged off sick at a quarter till nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remodeled store of some kind , with a curtained plate-glass window . She spotted it first not by its street number but by the knot of picketers outside . There werep238three women , several children , and a small , dapper man . THISCLINIC MURDERS THE INNOCENT , one sign said , and anothershowed a blown-up photo of a beautiful smiling baby with GIVE HER A CHANCE printed in white across her mop of black curls . Maggie parked in front of an insurance agency next door . The picketers glanced over at her and then went back to watching the clinic . A car drew up and a girl in jeans got out , followed by a young boy . The girl bent to say something to the driver , after which she waved and the car moved on . The couple walked briskly toward the clinic , while the picketers swarmed around them . " God sees what you 're about to do ! " one woman called , and another blocked the girl 's path , but she veered away . " Where is your conscience ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished behind the door . The picketers straggled back to their places . They were discussing something heatedly ; they appeared to be disagreeing . Maggie had the impression that some of them felt they should have been more forceful . A few minutes later , a woman alighted from a taxi . She was maybe Maggie 's age , very well dressed and all by herself . The picketers seemed to feel they had to make up for past defeats . They circled her ; they had so much to say that it came to Maggie 's ears as a garble of bee sounds . They pressed pamphlets on her . The largest of the women put an arm around her shoulders . The patient , if that was what she was , cried , " Let go of me ! " and jabbed an elbow into the picketer 's rib cage . Then she was gone too . The picketer bent over  --  in pain , Maggie thought at first , but she was merely lifting one of the children . They returned to their original positions . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked striven-for and counterfeit . Maggie rooted through her purse for a piece of paper to fan herself with . She would have liked to get out of the car , but then where would she stand ? Alongside the picketers ?  |p239Footste|ps  approached , a double set , and she glanced up to see Fiona and a slightly older girl , who must have been her sister . She had worried she would n't recognize Fiona , having caught sight of her only the once . But she knew her right off  --  the long fair hair , the pale face with nothing yet written upon it . She wore jeans and a bright , shrimp-pink T-shirt . As it happened , Maggie had a prejudice against shrimp pink . She thought it was lower-class . ( Oh , how strange it was to remember now that she had once viewed Fiona as lower-class ! She had imagined there was something cheap and gimcrack about her ; she had mistrusted the bland pallor of her face , and she had suspected that her sister 's too-heavy makeup concealed the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , having come to see Fiona 's good points . ) At any rate , she got out of the car . She walked over to them and said , " Fiona ? " The sister murmured , " Told you they 'd try something . " She must have thought Maggie was a picketer . And Fiona walked on , eyelids lowered so they were two white crescents . " Fiona , I 'm Jesse 's mother , " Maggie said . Fiona slowed and looked at her . The sister came to a stop . " I wo n't interfere if you 're certain you know what you 're doing , " Maggie said , " but , Fiona , have you considered every angle ? " " Not all that many to consider , " the sister said bluntly . " She 's seventeen years old . " Fiona allowed herself to be led away then , still gazing at Maggie over her shoulder . " Have you talked about it with Jesse ? " Maggie asked . She ran after them . " Jesse wants this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called back , " Is he going to bear it ? Is he going to walk it at night and change its diapers ? " " Yes , he is ! " Maggie said . " Well , not bear it , of course ... "  |p240They  had reached the picketers by now . A woman held out one of the pamphlets . On the front was a color photo of an unborn baby who seemed a good deal past the embryo stage , in fact almost ready to be delivered . Fiona shrank away . " Leave her alone , " Maggie told the woman . She said , " Fiona , Jesse really cares about you . You have to believe me . " " I have seen enough of Jesse Moran to last me a lifetime , " the sister said . She shoved past a fat woman with two toddlers and an infant in a sling . " You 're just saying that because you have him cast in this certain role , " Maggie told her , " this rock-band member who got your little sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not so cut-and-dried ! He bought a Dr. Spock book  --  did he mention that , Fiona ? He 's already researched pacifiers and he thinks you ought to breast-feed . " The fat woman said to Fiona , " All the angels in heaven are crying over you . " Listen , " Maggie told the woman . " Just because you 've got too many children is no reason to wish the same trouble on other people . " " The angels call it murder , " the woman said . Fiona flinched . Maggie said , " Ca n't you see you 're upsetting her ? " They had reached the door of the clinic now , but the dapper little man was barring their way . " Get out of here , " Maggie told him . " Fiona ! Just think it over ! That 's all I ask of you . The man held his ground , which gave Fiona time to turn to Maggie . She looked a little teary . " Jesse does n't care , " she said . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Do n't worry , Fiona , I wo n't let you down . ' Like I am some kind of obligation ! Some charitable cause ! " " He did n't mean it that way . You 're misreading him . He honestly wants to marry you . "  | " And live on what money ? " the sister asked . She had a braying , unpleasant voice , much deeper than Fiona 's . " He does n't even have a decent-paying job . " " He 's getting one ! Computers ! Opportunity for advancement ! " Maggie said . She was forced to speak so telegraphically because Fiona 's sister had somehow cleared the door of picketers and was tugging it open . A woman held a postcard in front of Fiona 's face : the curly-haired baby again . Maggie batted it aside . " At least come home with me so you and Jesse can talk it over , " she told Fiona . " That wo n't commit you to anything . " Fiona hesitated . Her sister said , " For God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . She took Fiona by the wrist and led her back through the crowd , keeping up a steady stream of encouragement . " He says he 's building a cradle ; he 's already got the plans . It 's enough to break your heart . Leave her alone , dammit ! Do I have to call the police ? Who gave you the right to pester us ? " " Who gave her the right to murder her baby ? " a woman called . " She has every right in the world ! Fiona , this is a naturalborncaretaker we 're talking about here . You should have seen him during the Hong Kong flu . " " The what ? " " Or Bangkok , or Sing Sing , or one of those flus . . . Anyway , it 's nothing to do with charity . He wants this baby more than anything . " Fiona peered into her face . She said , " And he 's buildinga ... ? " " He 's building a cradle . A beautiful one , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have a hood she could always say she had been mistaken . Fiona 's sister scurried alongside them , her heels clicking busily . She said , " Fiona , if you do n't get back in there this instant I am washing my hands of this whole affair , I tell you.  |p242Fiona  , they have scheduled you ! " And the picketers milled uncertainly a few feet behind . Fiona 's wrist was smooth and impossibly thin , like a stalk of bamboo . Maggie released it , reluctantly , in order to open the car door . " Climb in , " she said . " Buzz off , " she told the picketers . And to the sister she said , " Nice meeting you . " The picketers dropped back . One said , " Now look , uh ... " " We have constitutional permission to do this , I 'll have you know , " Maggie said . The woman looked confused . " I hunt up a clinic , " Fiona 's sister said , " I take her to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly good day off when I could have gone to Ocean City with my boy-friend  --  " " You could still do that , " Maggie said , checking her watch . She hurried around to the driver 's side , fearful that Fiona would try to escape , but when she got in , Fiona was sitting there limply with her head tipped back and her eyes closed . Her sister bent in through the open window . " Fiona , just tell me this much , " she said . " If Jesse Moran was so hot for this baby , how come it was n't him who came down here to fetch you ? " Fiona raised her lids and looked over at Maggie . " Well , he tried , " Maggie told her . " He 's been trying for days , you know he has , but somehow you 're always at cross-purposes . " Fiona closed her eyes again . Maggie started the car and drove off . The strange part was that having won  --  at least temporarily  --  shedid n't feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to tell the truth . How was it things had ended up this way , when all along she 'd been telling Jesse he was nowhere near old enough ? Oh , Lord . What had she gone and done ? She glanced secretly at Fiona . Fiona 's skin seemed slick , almost glazed . " Are you feeling ill ? " Maggie asked her . " I believe I might upchuck , " Fiona said , barely moving her lips.  | " You want me to stop the car ? " " Let 's just get there . " Maggie drove more carefully , as if transporting a basket ofeggs . In front of the house she parked , got out , and came around to help Fiona from her seat . Fiona was a dead weight . She leaned heavily against Maggie . But she had a young smellfresh-ironedcotton and those sugary beginner cosmetics you find in dime stores  --  and that gave Maggie some reassurance . Oh , this girl was not bad at heart ! She was barely older than Daisy ; she was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . They crossed the sidewalk slowly and climbed the steps to the porch . Their shoes made a hollow sound on the floorboards . " Sit here , " Maggie said , and she helped Fiona into the chair where she herself had sat all yesterday afternoon . " You need the air , " she said . " Take deep , deep breaths . I 'm going to go find Jesse . " Fiona closed her eyes . Inside , the rooms were cool and dark . Maggie climbed the stairs to Jesse 's room and knocked on his door . She poked her head in . " Jesse ? " she said . " Mmf . " His window shades were lowered so she could barely make out the shapes of the furniture . His bed was a tangle of twisted sheets . " Jesse , I 've brought Fiona , " she said . " Could you come down to the porch ? " " Huh ? " " Could you come down to the porch and talk with Fiona ? " He stirred a little and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She went back downstairs and into the kitchen , where she poured a glass of iced tea from a pitcher in the refrigerator . She put the glass on a china plate , encircled it with saltine crackers , and carried it out to Fiona . " Here , " she said . " Take little bites of these saltines . Take tiny sips of tea . "  |p244Fiona  was already looking better , sitting upright now in her chair , and she said , " Thank you , " when Maggie laid the plate on her knees . She nibbled at a corner of a cracker . Maggie settled in a rocker next to her . " When I was expecting Daisy , " Maggie said , " I lived on tea and saltines for two solid months . It 's a wonder we did n't both get malnutrition . I was so sick with Daisy I thought I would die , but with Jesse I never had a moment 's discomfort . Is n't that funny ? You 'd think it would have been the other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should 've stayed at the clinic , " she said . " Oh , honey , " Maggie said . She felt suddenly depressed . She had an instantaneous , chillingly clear vision of how Ira 's face would look when he learned what she had done . " Fiona , it 's not too late , " she said . " You 're only here to discuss it all , right ? You 're not committed to a thing . " Although even as she spoke she saw the clinic receding steadily . This was something like rushing toward a jump rope , she imagined . Miss that split second where entry is possible and you 've flubbed up everything . She reached out and touched Fiona 's arm . " And after all , " she said , " you do love each other , do n't you ? Do n't you love each other ? " " Yes , but maybe if we got married he would start to hold it against me , " Fiona said . " I mean , he 's a lead singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia or some such after he gets famous . And meanwhile , his band has just barely started earning any money . Where would we live ? How would we work this ? " " At first you could live here with us , " Maggie said . " Then in November you can move to an apartment Jesse knows about in Waverly . Jesse has it all figured out . " Fiona stared toward the street . " If I had stayed on at the clinic everything would be over by now , " she said after a minute.  | " Oh , Fiona . Please . Oh , tell me I did n't do wrong ! " Maggie said . She looked around for Jesse . What was keeping him ? It should n't be up to her to carry on this courtship . " Wait here , " she said . She got up and hurried into the house . " Jesse ! " she cried . But he did n't answer , and she heard the shower running . That boy would insist on showering first if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran upstairs and pounded on the bathroom door . " Jesse , are you coming ? " she called . He cut the water off . " What ? " he said . " Come out , I tell you ! " No answer . But she heard the shower curtain screech across the rod . She went into his bedroom and snapped up both window shades . She wanted to find his Dr. Spock book . It would serve as a kind of selling point till he came downstairs ; or at least it would provide a topic of conversation . But she could n't find it just dirty clothes , French-fry cartons , records left out of their jackets . She looked for the cradle plans then . What would they be  --  blueprints ? Not a sign of them . Well , of course , he 'd have taken them to the basement , where Ira kept his tools . She tore back down the stairs , calling toward the porch as she passed , " He 's on his way ! " ( She could picture Fiona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a set of narrow wooden steps , over to Ira 's workbench . No plans there , either . Ira 's tools hung neatly on the backboard , each matching its own painted outline  --  a sure sign Jesse had not been near them . On the workbench itself were two squares of sandpaper and a sheaf of doweling rods still bound together by rubber bands , part of a drying rack that Ira had promised to build into a corner of the back porch . She seized the doweling rods and raced back up the basement steps . " Look , " she told Fiona , slamming out the screen door . " Jesse 's cradle . " Fiona lowered her glass . She accepted the rods and gazed at them . " Cradle ? " she said doubtfully.  | " It 's going to have . . . spindles ; that 's what they are , " Maggie said . " Antique style . " You would think those rods could be read , the way Fiona studied them . Then Jesse came out , bringing with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tousled and his skin was radiant . He said , " Fiona ? You did n't go through with it ? " and she lifted her face , still holding the rods like a kind of scepter , and said , " Well , all right , Jesse , if you want . I guess we could get married if you want . " Then Jesse wrapped his arms around her and dropped his head to her shoulder , and something about that picture  --  his dark head next to her blond one  --  reminded Maggie of the way she used to envision marriage before she was married herself . She had thought of it as more different than it really was , somehow , more of an alteration in people 's lives  --  two opposites drawn together with a dramatic crashing sound . She had supposed that when she was married all her old problems would fall away , something like when you go on vacation and leave a few knotty tasks incomplete as if you 'd never have to come back and face them . And of course , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could almost believe that that early vision was the right one . She slipped into the house , shutting the screen door very softly behind her , and she decided everything was going to work out after all . They were married in Cartwheel , in Mrs. Stuckey 's living room . Just family attended . Ira was grim-faced and silent , Maggie'smother sat stiff with outrage , and Maggie 's father seemed befuddled . Only Mrs. Stuckey showed the proper festive attitude . She wore a fuchsia corduroy pantsuit and a corsage as big as her head , and before the ceremony she told everybody that her one regret was that Mr. Stuckey had not lived to see thisp247day . Although maybe , she said , he was here in spirit ; and then she went on at some length about her personal theory of ghosts . ( They were the completions of the dead 's intended gestures , their unfinished plans still hanging in the air  --  something like when you ca n't remember what it was you went to the kitchen for and so you pantomime the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reminds you you had come out to turn the dripping faucet off . So was n't there a chance that Mr. Stuckey was right here in the living room , having dreamed of walking both his precious daughters down the aisle someday ? ) Then she said that to her mind , marriage was just as educational as high school and maybe more so . " I mean I dropped out of school myself , " she said , " and have never once regretted it . " Fiona 's sister rolled her eyes . But it was a good thing Mrs. Stuckey felt that way , since Fiona would n't turn eighteen till January and required parental permission for a marriage license . Fiona herself wore a beige , loose-waisted dress that she and Maggie had gone shopping for together , and Jesse looked very distinguished in a suit and tie . He looked like a grownup , in fact . Daisy acted shy around him , and kept hanging on to Maggie 's arm and looking over at him . " What 's the matter with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling very irritable , for some reason . She worried that Ira was going to be angry at her forever . He seemed to be holding her solely accountablefor this entire situation . After the wedding , Jesse and Fiona went to Ocean City for a week . Then they came home to Jesse 's room , where Maggie had moved in an extra bureau and exchanged his old bunks for a double bed from J. C. Penney . The house grew more crowded , of course , but it was a pleasant sort of crowdedness , cheerful and expectant . Fiona seemed to fit right in ; she was so agreeable , so ready to let Maggie take charge  --  more so than Maggie 's own children had ever been . Jesse set off happily every morning for his computer job , and returned every evening with some newp248baby-care gadget  --  a pack of bunny-shaped diaper pins or an ingenious spouted training cup . He was reading up on childbirth and kept embracing different theories , each more peculiar than the last . ( For instance , at one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't find a doctor who would agree to it . ) Daisy and her friends forgot Mrs. Perfect entirely and camped in Maggie 's living room  --  five dumbstruck , enchanted little girls reverently eyeing Fiona 's stomach . And Fiona played up to them , sometimes inviting them to her room to admire her growing layette , after which she might seat them one by one at the mirror and experiment with their hair . ( Her sister was a beautician and had taught Fiona everything she knew , Fiona said . ) Then in the evening , if Jesse 's band had an engagementsomewhere , he and Fiona would go out together and not return till 2 or 3 a.m. , and Maggie , half waking , would hear their whispers on the stairs . The lock on their bedroom door would click stealthily and Maggie would sink back into sleep , contented . Even Ira seemed resigned , after he 'd got over the shock . Oh , at first he was so disgusted that Maggie had feared he would walk out of the house forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse entered the room he would leave . But gradually he came around . He was most comfortable , Maggie thought , when he could act tolerant and long-suffering , and surely he had the opportunity for that now . Here all his apprehensions had been confirmed : His son had got a girl in trouble and his wife had meddled unforgivably and now the girl was living in Jesse 's bedroom among the Iggy Pop posters . He could sigh and say , " Did n't I tell you ? Did n't I always warn you ? " ( Or at least he could give that impression ; not that he said it aloud . ) Fiona drifted past him into the bathroom every morning , wearing her fluffy pink robe and her big pink powder-puff slippers and carryingher tortoiseshell soapbox , and Ira flattened himself against the wall as if she were twice as big as she was . But he treatedp249her with unfailing courtesy . He even taught her his complicated brand of solitaire , when the boredom of sitting at home got to be too much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books  --  a whole row of memoirs by people who had sailed alone around the world and such . He had been trying to press them on his children for years . ( " As far as I 'm concerned , " Fiona told Maggie , " those books are just more of that How I took Route So-and-so ' that men always think is so fascinating . " But she did n't let on to Ira . ) And by November , when the Waverly apartment was supposed to become available , Ira did n't ask why they were n't moving out . Nor did Maggie ; she carefully avoided the subject . In fact , for all she knew , the apartment had fallen through somehow . Maybe the current tenants had changed their plans . At any rate , Jesse and Fiona said nothing about leaving . Fiona followed Maggie around now the way the children had followed her when they were tiny . She trailed her from room to room , asking fractious questions . " Why do I feel so logy ? " she asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " She had started attending childbirth classes and wanted Maggie to go with her to the labor room . Jesse , she said , might pass out or something . Maggie said , " Why , Jesse 's dying to go with you , " but Fiona said , " I do n't want him to see me like that ! He is n't even kin . " Nor was Maggie , Maggie could have said . Although it seemed she really was , in some ways . In Jesse 's company , Fiona began to take on an aggrieved and nagging tone . She complained about the unfairness  --  how Jesse got to go off to work every day while she sat home growing fatter . She should have stayed in school after all , she said , at least through fall semester ; but no , no , Jesse had to have things his way : homebody wife , the Little Mother act . When she spoke like this there was something old-ladyish in her voice , and Jesse when he answered sounded sullen . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiona would ask , and Jesse would say , " Ip250heard , I heard . " What was it that struck Maggie as so familiar ? It was a tune , almost . It was the tune of the arguments Jesse used to have with his parents ; that was it . Jesse and Fiona were more like a boy and his mother than husband and wife . But Fiona was n't feeling well ; no wonder she was snappish . That early-pregnancy sleepiness never left her , even in her seventhand eighth months , when most women were bundles of energy . Jesse would say , " Put on your clothes ! We 're booked at the Granite Tavern tonight and they 're paying us real money , " and she would say , " Oh , I do n't know ; maybe I 'll let you go on without me . " " Without you ? " he would ask . " You mean alone ? " And his face would get all hurt and surprised . But he would go . Once , he did n't even eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't coming with him , although it was barely 6 p.m . Then Fiona did n't eat , either , but sat there at the table playing with her food , a tear slipping down her cheek from time to time , and afterward she put on the hooded windbreaker that did n't button over her stomach anymore and she went for a long , long walk . Or she might have gone to visit her sister ; Maggie had no idea . At eight or so Jesse phoned and Maggie had to tell him she was out someplace . " What do you mean , out ? " he asked . " Just out , Jesse . I 'm sure she 'll be coming back soon . " " She said she was too tired to go out . She could n't come to the Granite Tavern because she was too tired . " " Oh , maybe she  --  " But he had already hung up , a metallic clunk in her ear . Well , these things happened . ( Did n't Maggie know they happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had reconciled at some point and acted more loving than ever . Maggie had been anxious for no reason , it turned out . .  |p251The  baby was due in early March , but on February first Fiona woke up with a backache . Maggie was excited the instant she heard . " This is it , I bet , " she told Fiona . " It ca n't be ! " Fiona said . " I 'm not ready . " " Of course you 're ready . You 've got your layette ; your suitcaseis packed  --  " " But Jesse has n't built the cradle yet . " It was true . Whatever other equipment he 'd laid in , that cradle had not materialized . Maggie said , " Never mind ; he can do it while you 're in the hospital . " " This is a plain old backache anyhow , " Fiona said . " I'vehad this feeling often , before I was pregnant , even . " At noon , though , when Maggie phoned from work , Fionasounded less certain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystomach , " she said . " Can you please come home early ? " " I 'll be there , " Maggie told her . " Have you called Jesse yet ? " " Jesse ? No . " " Why do n't you call him . " " Okay , but promise you 'll come home ? Start right now . " " I 'm on my way . " She arrived to find Jesse timing Fiona 's contractions , using an official-looking stopwatch he 'd bought especially for this occasion . He was jubilant . " We 're moving right along ! " he told Maggie . Fiona looked scared . She kept giving little moans , not during the contractions but between them . " Hon , I do n't think you 're breathing right , " Jesse told her . Fiona said , " Lay off about my breathing ! I 'll breathe any way I choose . " " Well , I just want you to be comfortable . Are you comfortable ? Is the baby moving ? " " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiona ? You must have some idea . "  | " I do n't know , I tell you . No . He 's not . " " The baby is n't moving , " Jesse told Maggie . " Do n't worry . He 's just getting ready , " Maggie said . " Something must be wrong . " " Nothing 's wrong , Jesse . Believe me . " But he did n't believe her , which is why they ended up leaving for the hospital far too early . Maggie drove . Jesse said he might crash the car if he drove , but then he spent the whole trip protesting every move Maggie made . " What possessed you to get behind a bus ? Switch lanes . Not now , for God 's sake ! Check your rearview mirror . Oh , God , we 'll all be killed and they 'll have to cut the baby out of her stomach in the middle of Franklin Street . " Fiona shrieked at this , which so unnerved Maggie that she slammed on the brakes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Let us out ! Better we go by foot ! Let her give birth on the sidewalk ! " " Fine , " Maggie said . " Get out of the car . " Fiona said , " What ? " " Now , Ma , just cool it , " Jesse said . " No need to get hysterical . Depend on Ma to fall apart in any little emergency , " he told Fiona . They rode the rest of the way in silence , and Maggie left them at the hospital entrance and went off to park . When she located them in Admissions , Fiona was just settlinginto a wheelchair . " I want my mother-in-law to come with me , " she told the nurse . " Only Daddy can come with you , " the nurse said . " Grandma has to stay in the waiting room . " Grandma ? " I do n't want Daddy , I want Grandma ! " Fiona cried , soundingabout six years old . " Here we go now , " the nurse said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt , undefended expression Maggiehad seen so often lately.  |p253Maggie  went to the waiting room , which was the size of a football field . A vast expanse of beige carpeting was broken up by clustered arrangements of beige vinyl couches and chairs . She settled on an empty couch and chose a ruffle-edged magazinefrom the beige wooden end table . " How to Keep the Zing ! in Your Marriage , " the first article was called . It instructed her to be unpredictable ; greet her husband after work wearing nothing but a black lace apron . Ira would think she had lost her mind . Not to mention Jesse and Fiona and the five enchanted little girls . She wished she had thought to bring her knitting . She was n't that much of a knitter  --  her stitches had a way of galloping along for a few inches and then squinching up in tight little puckers , reminding her of a car that bucks and stalls  --  but lately she had thrown herself into a purple football jersey for the baby . ( It was going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' names had been considered . ) She set the magazine aside and went over to the flank of pay phones that lined one wall . First she dialed the number at home . When no one answered  --  not even Daisy , who was usuallyback from school by three  --  she checked her watch and discovered it was barely two o'clock . She had thought it was much later . She dialed Ira 's work number . " Sam 's Frame Shop , " he answered . " Ira ? " she said . " Guess what I 'm at the hospital . " " You are ? What 's wrong ? " " Nothing 's wrong . Fiona 's having her baby . " " Oh , " he said . " I thought you 'd crashed the car or some-thing . " " You want to come wait with me ? It 's going to be a while yet . " Well , maybe I should go home to watch Daisy , " Ira said . Maggie sighed . " Daisy 's at school , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching in years . " " You 'll want someone to put supper on , though . " She gave up on him . ( Lord forbid her deathbed should bep254in a hospital ; he would probably not attend it . ) She said , " Well , suit yourself , Ira , but I would think you 'd want to see your own grandchild . " " I 'll see him soon enough , wo n't I ? " Ira asked . Maggie glimpsed Jesse across the waiting room . " I have to go now , " she said , and she hung up . " Jesse ? " she said , hurrying toward him . " What 's the news ? " " Everything 's fine . Or so they claim . " " How 's Fiona ? " " She 's scared , " he said , " and I try to calm her down , but those hospital people keep shooing me out . Anytime someone official comes they ask me to leave . " So much for modern developments , Maggie thought . Men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Fiona but kept Maggie posted , reappearing every half hour or so to speak knowingly of stages and centimeters . " It 's going pretty fast now , " he said once , and another time , " Many people believe that an eight-months baby is more at risk than a seven-months baby , but that 's an old wives ' tale . It 's just a superstition . " His hair stood up in thick tufts , like wind-tossed grass . Maggie restrained herself from reaching out to smooth it . Unexpectedly , he reminded her of Ira . However different the two might be in other ways , they both had this notion that reading up on something , getting equipped for something , would put them in control . She considered going home for a while ( it was nearly five o'clock ) but she knew she would only fret and pace , so she stayed where she was and kept in touch by telephone . Daisy reported that Ira was fixing a pancake supper . " No green vegetable ? " Maggie asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone to assure her that he was serving spiced crab-apple rings on the side . " Spiced crab-apple rings are not green , Ira , " Maggie said . She felt herself growing weepy . She ought to be at home supervising her family 's nutrition ; she ought to bep255storming the labor room to comfort Fiona ; she ought to take Jesse in her arms and rock him because he was nothing but a child still , much too young for what was happening to him . But here she stood , clutching a salty-smelling receiver in a public phone hutch . Her stomach felt all knotted and tight . It had n't been so long since she was a patient in the labor room herself , and her muscles recalled it exactly . She told Ira goodbye and went through the doors where Jesse kept disappearing . She traveled down a corridor , hoping for , oh , at least a nursery full of newborns to cheer her up . She passed another , smaller waiting room , perhaps leading to some lab or private office . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and across from them sat a burly man in paintspatteredcoveralls . As Maggie slowed to glance in , a nurse called , " Mr. Plum ? " and the elderly man rose and went toward a back room , leaving behind a brand new magazine . Maggie breezed in as if she had a perfect right to be there and scooped up the magazine , at the same time performing a clumsy halfcurtsyto show the old woman she meant no intrusion . She settled beside the man in coveralls . Never mind that this was just another ladies ' magazine ; at least the pages still gave off a shellacked , unused smell and the movie stars spilling their secretswere wearing up-to-date hairdos . She skimmed an article about a new kind of diet . You picked one favorite food and ate all you wanted , three times a day , nothing else besides . Maggie would have chosen beef-and-bean burritos from Lexington Market . In the back room , the nurse said , " Now , Mr. Plum , I 'm giving you this jar for urine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that ? " " It 's for urine ! " " Speak up  --  I ca n't hear you . "  | " Urine , I said ! You take this jar home ! You collect all your urine ! For twenty-four hours ! You bring the jar back ! " In the chair across from Maggie , the wife gave an embarrassedtitter . " He 's deaf as a doorknob , " she told Maggie . " Has to have everything shouted out for all and sundry to hear . " Maggie smiled and shook her head , not knowing how else to respond . Then the man in coveralls stirred . He placed his great , furry fists on his knees . He cleared his throat . " You know , " he said , " it 's the funniest thing . I can catch that nurse 's voice all right but I do n't understand a single word she 's saying . " Maggie 's eyes filled with tears . She dropped her magazine and groped in her purse for a Kleenex , and the man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell him it was his kindness that had undone her  --  such delicacy , in such an unlikely-looking person  --  and so she said , " It 's my son , he 's having a baby . I mean my son 's wife is . " The man and the old woman waited , their faces prepared to take on the proper look of shock and pity as soon as they heard the bad part . And she could n't tell them , " It 's all my fault , I set everything pell-mell in motion not once considering the consequences , " so instead she said , " It 's months and months too early , it 's nowhere near her due date ... " The man clicked his tongue . His forehead furrowed upon itself like cloth . The old woman said , " Oh , my stars , you must be worried sick . But do n't you give up hope , because my nephew Brady 's wife , Angela ... " And that was why , when Jesse passed down the corridor from the delivery room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little side cubicle surrounded by a huddle of strangers . They were patting her and murmuring consolations  --  an old woman , a workman of some sort , a nurse with a clipboard , and a stooped old man clutching a gigantic empty jar . " Ma ? " Jesse said , steppingin . " The baby 's here , and both of them are fine . " .  | " Praise Jesus ! " the old woman shouted , flinging her hands toward the ceiling . " The only trouble is , " Jesse said , eyeing the woman dubiously , " it 's a girl . I was n't counting on a girl , somehow . " " You would let a thing like that bother you ? " the old woman demanded . " At a moment such as this ? That child was snatched from the jaws of death ! " " From . . . ? " Jesse said . Then he said , " No , it 's just a superstition that an eight-months  --  " " Let 's get out of here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the huddle to grab his arm and steer him away . How that baby took over the house ! Her cries of fury and her mourning-dove coos , her mingled smells of powder and ammonia , her wheeling arms and legs . She had Fiona 's coloring but Jesse 's spirit and his feistineess ( no Lady-Baby this time ) . Her small , fine features were scrunched very close together low down in her face , so when Fiona combed her bit of hair into a sprout on top of her head she resembled a Kewpie doll ; and like a doll she was trundled everywhere by the enchanted little girls , who would have cut school if permitted , just to lug her about by the armpits and shake her rattle too close to her eyes and hang over her , breathing heavily , while Maggie bathed her . Even Ira showed some interest , although he pretended not to . " Let me know when she 's big enough to play baseball , " he said , but as early as the second week , Maggie caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept , and by the time she had learned to sit up , the two of them were deep in those exclusive conversations of theirs . And Jesse ? He was devoted  --  always offering to help out , sometimes making a nuisance of himself , to hear Fiona tell it . He walked Leroy during her fussy spells , and he left his warm bed to burp her and then carry her back to Maggie 's room afterp258the two o'clock feeding . And once , when Maggie took Fiona shopping , he spent a whole Saturday morning solely in charge , returning Leroy none the worse for wear , although the careful way he had dressed her  --  with her overall straps mistakenly clamping down her collar , severely mashing the double row of ruffles  --  made Maggie feel sad , for some reason . He claimed that he had never wanted a boy at all ; or if he had , he could n't remember why . " Girls are perfect , " he said . " Leroy is perfect . Except , you know ... " " Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that . . . shoot , before she was born I had this sort of , like , anticipation . And now I 've got nothing to anticipate , you know ? " " Oh , that 'll pass , " Maggie said . " Do n't worry . " But later , to Ira , she said , " I never heard of a father getting postpartum blues . " Maybe if the mother did n't , the father did ; was that the way it worked ? For Fiona herself was cheerful and oblivious . Often as she flitted around the baby she seemed more like one of the enchanted little girls than like a mother . She paid too much heed to Leroy 's appurtenances , Maggie felt to her frilly clothes , her ribboned sprout of hair . Or maybe it just seemed so . Maybe Maggie was jealous . It was true that she hated to relinquish the baby when she went off to work every morning . " How can I leave her ? " she wailed to Ira . " Fiona does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , only one way she 's ever going to learn , " Ira said . And so Maggie left , hanging back internally , and called home several times a day to see how things were going . But they were always going fine . In the nursing home one afternoon she heard a middle-aged visitor talking to his mother  --  a vacant , slack-jawed woman in a wheelchair . He told her how his wife was , how the kids were . His mother smoothed her lap robe . He told her how his jobp259was . His mother plucked at a bit of lint and flicked it onto the floor . He told her about a postcard that had come for her at the house . The church was holding an Easter bazaar and they wanted her to check off which task she would volunteer for . This struck the son as comical , in view of his mother 's disabilities . " They offered you your choice , " he said , chuckling .

" Maggie knew just how she felt . Leroy was a long , thin infant , and Fiona worried she was outgrowing the bureau drawer she slept in . " When are you going to get started on that cradle ? " she asked Jesse , and Jesse said , " Any day now . " Maggie said , " Maybe we should just buy a crib . A cradle 's for a newborn ; she would n't fit it for long . " But Fiona said , " No , I set my heart on a cradle . " She told Jesse . " You promised . " " I do n't remember promising . " " Well , you did , " she said . " All right ! I 'll get to it ! Did n't I tell you I would ? " " You do n't have to shout at me , " she said . " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Am not . " " Are too . " " Children ! Children ! " Maggie said , pretending she was joking . But only pretending . Once , Fiona spent the night at her sister 's , snatching up the baby and stomping out after a fight . Or not a fight exactly but a little misunderstanding : The band was playing at a club in downtown Baltimore and Fiona planned to come along , asp260usual , till Jesse worried aloud that Leroy had a cold and should n't be left . Fiona said Maggie would tend her just fine and Jesse said a baby with a cold needed her mother and then Fiona said it was amazing how he was so considerate of that baby but so inconsiderate of his wife and then Jesse said .. . Well . Fiona left and did not come back until morning ; Maggie feared she was gone for good , endangering that poor sick baby , who needed much more nursing than Fiona could provide . She must have been planning to desert them all along , in fact . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd that for almost a year now she had borne off to the bathroom twice daily a tortoiseshell soapbox , a tube of Aim toothpaste ( not the Morans ' brand ) , and a toothbrush in a plastic cylinder ? And that her toilet supplies were continually stored in a clear vinyl travel case on the bureau ? She might as well be a guest . She had never meant to settle in permanently . " Go after her , " Maggie told Jesse , but Jesse asked , " Why should I ? She 's the one who walked out . " He was at work when Fiona returned the next day , wan and puffy-eyed . Strands of her uncombed hair mingled with the fake-fur trim of her windbreakerhood , and Leroy was wrapped clumsily in a garish daisysquareafghan that must have belonged to the sister . What Maggie 's mother said was true : The generations were sliding downhill in this family . They were descending in every respect , not just in their professions and their educations but in the way they reared their children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you let things get so common ? " Maggie heard again in her memory . ) Mrs. Daley stood over the sleeping Leroy and pleated her lips in disapproval . " They would put an infant in a bureau drawer ? They would let her stay in here with you and Ira ? What can they be thinking of ? It must be that Fiona person . Really , Maggie , that Fiona is so . . . Why , she is n't even a Baltimore girl ! Anyone who would pronounce Wi/comico as Weeko-Meeko ! And what is that racket I 'm hearing ? " Maggie tilted her head to listen . " It 's Canned Heat , " she decided . " Candide ? I 'm not asking the name of it ; I mean why is it playing ? When you children were small I played Beethoven and Brahms , I played all of Wagner 's operas ! " Yes , and Maggie could still recall her itch of boredom as Wagner 's grandiose weight crashed through the house . And her frustration when , beginning some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she had been cut short by her mother . ( " Emma and I , ' if you please . " ) She had sworn never to do that to her own children , preferring to hear what it was they had to say and let the grammar take care of itself . Not that it had done so , at least not in Jesse 's case . Maybe her own downhill slide was deliberate . If so , she owed Jesse an apology . Maybe he was just carrying out her secret scheme for revolution , and would otherwise  --  who knows ?  --  have gone on to be a lawyer like Mrs. Daley 's father . Well , too late now . Leroy learned to crawl and she crawled right out of her bureau drawer , and the next day Ira came home with a crib . He assembled it , without comment , in his and Maggie 's bedroom .

They would take a huge picnic lunch and a ten-dollar bill for each person to bet with . In times past the whole family had squeezed into Ira 's car , but of course that was no longer possible . This year they had Jesse and Fiona ( who had been away on their honeymoon the year before ) ,
