Flight <P> The Atlantic in its immense indifference was not aware that man-made cables on its slimy bottom contained news , that the silent heavens above pulsed with news-news that would set thousands of printing presses in motion , news that would make sirens scream in every U. S. city , news that would cause housewives to run out into backyards and shout to their children : " Lindbergh is in Paris ! " <P> Late one evening last week Capt . Charles A. Lindbergh studied weather reports and decided that the elements were propitious for a flight from New York to Paris . He took a two-hour sleep , then busied himself with final preparations at Roosevelt Field , L. I. Four sandwiches , two canteens of water and emergency army rations , along with 451 gallons of gasoline were put into his monoplane , Spirit of St. Louis . " When I enter the cockpit , " said he , " it 's like going into the death chamber . When I step out at Paris it will be like getting a pardon from the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. he was roaring down the runway , his plane lurching on the soft spots of the wet ground . Out of the safety zone , he hit a bump , bounced into the air , quickly returned to earth . Disaster seemed imminent ; a tractor and a gully were-ahead . Then his plane took the air , cleared the tractor , the gully ; cleared some telephone wires . Five hundred onlookers believed they had witnessed a miracle . It was a miracle of skill . <P> Captain Lindbergh took the shortest route to Paris-the great circle-cutting across Long Island Sound , Cape Cod , Nova Scotia , skirting the coast of Newfoundland . He later told some of his sky adventures to the aeronautically alert New York Times for syndication : " Shortly after leaving Newfoundland , I began to see icebergs . . . . Within an hour it became dark . Then I struck clouds and decided to try to get over them . For a while I succeeded at a height of 10,000 feet . I flew at this height until early morning . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I felt just as if I was driving a motor car over a smooth road , only it was easier . Then it began to get light and the clouds got higher . . . . Sleet began to cling to the plane . That worried me a great deal and I debated whether I should keep on or go back . I decided I must not think any more about going back . . . . <P> " Fairly early in the afternoon I saw a fleet of fishing boats . . . . On one of them I saw some men and flew down almost touching the craft and yelled at them , asking if I was on the right road to Ireland . They just stared . Maybe they did n't hear me . Maybe I did n't hear them . Or maybe they thought I was just a crazy fool . <P> " An hour later I saw land . . . I flew quite low enough over Ireland to be seen , but apparently no great attention was paid to me . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Channel , followed the Seine to Paris , where he circled the city before recognizing the flying field at Le Bourget . Said he : " I had intended taxiing up to the front of the hangars , but no sooner had my plane touched the ground than a human sea swept toward it . I saw there was danger of killing people with my propeller and I quickly came to a stop . "
