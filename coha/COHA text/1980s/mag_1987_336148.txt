It was a week for unburning the books . In two major cases just two days apart , Fundamentalist Christians were dismayed to see federal appeals courts throw out earlier rulings against public school textbooks . As a result , pupils returning to reading classes in Hawkins County , Tenn. , can still be required to tackle the themes in The Wizard of Oz and The Diary of Anne Frank , among a * host of other books deemed " godless " by a group of parents . And in Alabama , teachers will still be using 44 texts that Fundamentalists had sued to remove for promoting the " religion " of secular humanism . <P> In the Tennessee case , a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Appeals Court in Cincinnati ruled unanimously that public school students can be required to read and discuss the disputed books , even though parts of those books might conflict with their beliefs . In a suit they brought in 1983 , seven Fundamentalist families had contended that exposing their children to such material violated the First Amendment right to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages , the parents charged that the readings taught such taboo topics as evolution , feminism , situational ethics and belief in the occult . <P> In 1986 Federal Judge Thomas Hull ruled for the families , ordering that their children be allowed to sit out the reading classes . He also ordered the school board to pay the families more than $50,000 in damages . In overturning the decision last week , Appellate Judge Pierce Lively wrote that Hull had failed to distinguish between simply reading or talking about other beliefs and being compelled to adopt them . " There was no evidence , " Lively declared , " that the conduct required of the students was forbidden by their religion . " <P> The Alabama case , which also involved a group of Fundamentalist parents as plaintiffs , hinged upon a different provision of the First Amendment , the establishment clause , which undergirds church and state separation . In March , Federal Judge W. Brevard Hand ruled that 44 history , social studies and home economics books used throughout the state violated the establishment clause by promoting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " that salvation is through one 's self rather than through a deity . " <P> In unanimously overturning Hand 's decision , the three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Appeals Court in Atlanta sidestepped the issue of whether secular humanism is a religion . Even assuming that it were a religion , wrote Appellate Judge Frank Johnson Jr. , the plaintiffs had failed to show that the books promoted secular humanism . The information in the books , Johnson argued , was " essentially neutral in its religious content . " Hand had also maintained that the history and social studies texts had been drained of virtually all mentions of the role of religion in society . That may be true , Johnson &; responded , but it did not constitute " an advancement of secular humanism or an active hostility toward theistic religion . "
