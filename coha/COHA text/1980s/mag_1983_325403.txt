Many states defy Washington by closing roads to monster trucks <P> When Congress last December passed the 5-per-gal. increase in the gasoline tax , designed to patch the nation 's pothole-pocked highway system , it made a deal with the trucking industry . In addition to having to pay more at the pump beginning April 1 , truckers found their highway-use taxes and registration fees raised , as of July 1984 , from $240 a year to $1,600 for the largest rigs . As a palliative , Congress created rules to permit tandem-trailer trucks , some of them 40 tons in weight when loaded , unprecedented access to the interstate highway system and most of the nation 's 260,000 miles of " primary " federally aided roads . <P> The provision , which went into effect last week , put the U.S. Government and a handful of states on a collision course . The state legislature of Connecticut , which has outlawed tandem trailers on all roads since 1949 , voted to continue its ban , thus becoming the first state to defy the new law . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant rigs to interstate highways and two other major roads and proscribing them from roads the new federal law had opened up . By week 's end Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Vermont , Virginia and South Carolina pointedly announced that state troopers would continue to ticket truckers using tandem trailers , at least on certain highways . <P> The new federal legislation spelled out the first uniform , national standards for truck weights and measurements . It allows trucks up to 80,000 Ibs. in weight , 102 in. wide and 56 ft. long ( plus the cab ) to operate the full length of the 42,268-mile interstate system . The law also requires each state to designate other highways that could handle these loads . <P> The response from the states varied from cooperation to defiance . Some opened all their primary roads , others agreed to give the big rigs right-of-way over 50% or more of these highways . But the Federal Government was not taking no for an answer ; when some states balked , the Department of Transportation as an interim measure added about 38,000 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the states still refuse to comply , they could lose their federal highway funds . <P> Some recalcitrant states , in reply , charged that DOT was sloppy in selecting the routes for the interim list . According to the New Jersey transportation department , DOT opened to 40-ton trucks a portion of Route 9 in the state that includes a bridge currently posted with a twelve-ton weight limit . The designations will also permit bigger trucks to rumble through the traffic-clogged streets of New York City , Philadelphia , Trenton and other metropolitan areas on their way to delivery terminals . <P> Regardless of the size of the road , the rigs themselves may pose a safety hazard : critics say they are harder to control and more prone to jackknife than smaller trucks . Truck drivers assert , however , that tandem trailers , known in the industry as " double bottoms , " are safer than smaller rigs because they have extra axles and better weight distribution . But there is little question that the larger rigs will batter the nation 's interstate highway system , initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
