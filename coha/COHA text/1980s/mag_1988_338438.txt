At the tenth-anniversary dinner for his spunky little journal , the Washington Monthly , Editor Charles Peters stood up and baptized his iconoclastic movement . " We 're neoliberals , " he told his disciples . That was in 1979 , and since then , they have worked a quiet revolution . By exposing the dusty tenets of American liberalism to some fresh ideas and empirical questioning , Peters and his followers have helped rescue it from the clutches of interest groups , entrenched bureaucratic thinking and post-Viet Nam neuroses . Now , in Tilting at Windmills , Peters offers an amiable tract designed to elucidate what he jocularly refers to as " the one true faith . " <P> In the gospel according to Peters , the most fundamental maxim is that ideas can not be divorced from experience . Consequently , his book comes cloaked as an autobiography . As he ambles through the events of his life , Peters collects simple lessons and weaves them into a political creed . From his childhood in Charleston , W. Va. , he developed an ideal of community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From his Army service , he picked up a lasting disdain for class distinctions . And a stint as a Peace Corps administrator left him with a sharp eye for the foibles of Government bureaucracies . <P> With the Washington Monthly 's piquant mixture of myth-piercing reporting and clear-eyed opinions , Peters created a new style of journalism that looked at Washington , in his words , " the way that an anthropologist looks at a South Sea island . " Equally important , he trained a cadre of young followers who went on to apply his rigorously intellectual approach at larger publications . <P> For nondisciples , Peters ' book is destined to be disappointing in parts . It tends to treat issues involving race and poverty as grist for abstract ideas rather than emotional commitment . It occasionally lapses into homilies rather than serious expositions of a philosophy . Yet it is the simple goodness of these homilies that accounts for much of Peters ' allure . With a sweetness and grace that make him the least jaded journalist in Washington , Peters turns Windmills into an inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense and for deeds that can make a difference .
