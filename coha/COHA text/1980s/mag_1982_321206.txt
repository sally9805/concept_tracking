The Senate has long been a congenial home for flamboyant independent thinkers . <P> In races in Connecticut and California , a pair of the nation 's leading political iconoclasts is trying to keep it that way . Two hard-fought House races show the struggle of minority candidates-one a Hispanic Republican , the other a black Democrat from Mississippi-to build the coalitions necessary for victory . <P> <P> Title fight <P> In speech after speech , at fair after fair and parade after parade , Republican Senator Lowell Weicker stresses his maverick ways . NOBODY 'S MAN BUT YOURS his billboards proclaim . But that is just the problem , retorts his rival , four-term Democratic Congressman Toby Moffett : " Nobody 's man is part of nobody 's plan . " Weicker is so independent , suggests Moffett , that he is a political hermit devoid of effectiveness . <P> The Weicker-Moffett match-up is the long-awaited title fight between two of Connecticut 's best-known politicians . Even before Weicker , 51 , came to national prominence as a member of the Senate Watergate committee , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lately he has been following a more conventional Republican line , consistently supporting President Reagan on economic , military and even environmental policy . On the campaign trail , however , the two-term incumbent stresses his liberal stance on social issues . Weicker portrays himself as a modern knight wielding the Constitution as a shield to ward off the dragon of the New Right . " Please do n't let them politicize our Constitution , " he pleads . " If I go down , you go down . " <P> Moffett , 38 , irritatedly replies that Weicker is not part of the solution but , as a Republican in the Republican-controlled Senate , part of the problem : Moffett 's own liberal credentials on both economic and social issues are letter-perfect , and his sharp criticism of Administration policies has given him a high profile in the House . An earnest former Nader Raider who came to the House as part of the reform-bent class of ' 74 in Watergate 's wake , he asserts that Reaganomics is " cruel and destructive . " He contends that the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessly isolated , Moffett constantly stresses the argument that his own election will help the Democrats regain control of the Senate by 1984 . <P> In the past , Weicker depended on the votes of disillusioned Democrats . Now he is wooing traditional Republicans by claiming that an independent Republican is better than no Republican at all . Says he : " I think I 'm a very good Republican , because , No. 1 , I get elected . " Whether he does so again could depend on Conservative Candidate Lucien DiFazio , 39 , a Hartford lawyer who entered the race only nine weeks ago . Although DiFazio has no chance of winning , he has substantial financial backing from the New Right and might siphon off votes from Weicker . With Weicker leading Moffett by only a few points in the polls , even a small swing to DiFazio could affect the outcome . <P> Survival course
