A LITTLE ORIGINAL SIN : THE LIFE AND WORK OF JANE BOWLES by Millicent Dillon ; Holt , Rinehart &; Winston ; 464 pages ; $18.95 <P> When Jane Bowles was just turning 20 , she wrote a childhood friend : " Life suddenly seems as short as a pistol shot . " She must have meant the good parts . The achievements of her 56 years-a funny , excruciating novel , Two Serious Ladies , a haunted , talky play , In the Summer House , and a handful of short stories-were chiefly completed before she was 30 . These bits and fragments of rather gentle despair , jagged as broken glass , brilliant as diamond chips , have made Jane Bowles a minor cult figure ( Tennessee Williams has called her " the most underrated American writer of this century " ) . But it was Bowies ' life that made her a legend even before she died in 1973 . <P> Millicent Dillon , a novelist herself , has taken all the melancholy details and produced much more than a horror story , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her subject . <P> The description of Jane as a child fitted her throughout most of her life : " An elf with large luminous eyes and a ski-jump nose . " At parties she loved to sit on men 's laps , and was known to dance on tables-a flapper too late for the jazz age . <P> Jane began cruising gay bars in Greenwich Village at the age of 18 , but she was unfamiliar with the ways of men when she married the composer Paul Bowles in 1938 at the age of 20 . All her life people found something simultaneously " prim and outrageous " about her . Friends tended to adopt Jane as if she were a slightly dangerous exotic pet . Her wit came with sharp little teeth-she was a devastating mimic-and she could turn in an instant from purring flirtation to inexplicable rage . Yet , in an oddly old-fashioned way , she dispensed food , hospitality and unstinting affection to those who , like herself , found life difficult . <P> Behind the amusing , naughty little girl , capable of charming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capote , there squirmed an agonized idealist . She believed that everything in life was a moral choice , yet remained so indecisive that she could hardly select a meal in a restaurant . <P> Writing involved the most torturous choices of all . She found the process " nauseous " and her writing materials so menacing that she referred to blank paper and her pens as " Nazis . " All her indecisiveness came out in writing , as she immersed herself now in one character , now in another-then , as often as not , reversed them . Indecisiveness was the torment of her life , and the living center of her art . " What shall we do ? " Williams recalls the question , frivolous Millicent Dillon and terror-stricken , as her leitmotiv . <P> She hated to travel , and she traveled everywhere : Mexico , Paris , Ceylon , North Africa . Nowhere did she find peace , least of all in Tangier , where the Bowleses made their home from 1948 on . She took woman after woman as lover , yet her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
