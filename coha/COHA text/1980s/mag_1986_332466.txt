After five years of hard labor on a farm outside Peking and 16 years of internal exile in the remote province of Xinjiang , Writer Wang Meng was officially confirmed last week as China 's new Minister of Culture . Prior to his appointment , he said he did not want the position but , if chosen , would have to accept . <P> In 1957 Novelist Wang fell victim to Chairman Mao Tse-tung 's " antirightist " cam- paign . On the basis of one short story published during the surge of creativity that followed the preceding Hundred Flowers movement , Wang was accused of " destructive , anti-party " sentiments . <P> Wang 's appointment marks an attempt by Deng Xiaoping and other top Communist Party officials to convince Chinese intellectuals that the repression of the Cultural Revolution will not recur . Writers , however , remain skeptical . Despite his advocacy of creative freedom , Wang has proved a staunch supporter of party policy on the arts .                  @ @ @
