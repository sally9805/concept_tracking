The origins of the Mafia are lost in the mists of Sicily 's tortured history . Scholars disagree on whether the term came from maehfil , meaning union in the language of the 9th century Arab conquerors of Sicily , or from the Tuscan word maffia , signifying poverty or misery . But there is little doubt that centuries of foreign occupation and feudal oppression turned Sicily into a unique breeding ground for organized crime . <P> The precursors of the modern Mafia were the compagnie d'armi , small private armies that feudal overlords employed to enforce their authority . In the absence of law courts , these armies dispensed a hideous kind of primitive justice . Peasants who found a corpse with a hand chopped off knew that a petty thief had been punished . A body with severed genitals stuffed in his mouth meant that the dead man had " offended " the wife of a compagnie member . A missing tongue signified that someone had violated the code of omerta , or silence . <P> By the time the term Mafia came into general usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old compagnie d'armi had evolved into a secret hierarchical organization , divided into specialized sectors that controlled Sicily 's cattle and pasturelands , slaughterhouses , fruit plantations , market gardens and ports . The nucleus of the " honored association , " as the Mafia 's members euphemistically referred to their organization , was the family , whose members were linked by blood or marriage . A group of families would be allied in a cosca ( artichoke ) , a cluster of separate leaves forming a single unit . <P> The Mafia entered the U.S. along with the wave of immigration that peaked in the first decades of this century . Legendary Sicilian Mafia Chief Don Vito Cascio Ferro is said to have traveled to the U.S. in 1900 to help found the Black Hand , a Mafia-affiliated organization . Back home , Don Vito liked to boast of how he murdered New York City Police Detective Giuseppe Petrosino , an Italian American who had traveled to Palermo in 1909 to investigate the links between the Black Hand and the Sicilian Mafia . On the day the policeman arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sicilian deputy of the Italian parliament , shot Petrosino outside Palermo 's courthouse and returned in the deputy 's carriage to finish his meal . The deputy saved Don Vito from murder charges by swearing that his guest had never left his home . <P> <P> In order to consolidate his dictatorship , Benito Mussolini decided to crush the Mafia in the mid-1920s . Using such draconian methods as torture and summary execution , the police weakened the Mafia 's stranglehold on Sicily . Don Vito was arrested and convicted for smuggling . When the president of the court asked Don Vito if he had something to say in his defense , the tall , distinguished-looking old man with a flowing beard declared , " Gentlemen , since you have been unable to find any evidence for the numerous crimes I really have committed , you are reduced to condemning me for the only one I have not .
