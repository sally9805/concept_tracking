The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is surely the season 's strangest book title . Nonetheless , the collection of literate yet authoritative case studies by Neurologist Oliver Sacks , 52 , has been on bestseller lists across the country these past 13 weeks . " I am equally interested in diseases and people , " says Sacks , who teaches and practices in New York City , and his accounts of loss , excess and aberration always seek the individual behind the disorder . Perhaps because such a readable combination of erudition and compassion is so rare , Sacks ' four books have earned him a quasineurological disorder of his own : the assault of fame . " There are too many letters and phone calls , " he laments . " After a while I long to get away . " He has just done so , visiting his home in London . One 's roots can , after all , inspire one to keep going . His father is a physician who still practices at 90.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
