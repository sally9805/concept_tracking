DALLAS  --  American Airlines , moving to shore up profit that has been eroded by discount fares , said it will increase restrictions on discount fares starting May 23 . American plans to boost cancellation fees on fares that require advance ticket purchases and will consolidate its fare structure . The move will make it more difficult for consumers to obtain inexpensive fares without cancellation fees . But it also could simplify fare choices , reducing dozens of different fare levels to only six . And if the other major carriers go along , it could help avoid fare wars during peak summer travel months and could improve airline profits in the second half , analysts said . Most major airlines said they were still studying American ' s action . But if they eventually match American , as they have in the past , travelers seeking the cheapest fare would have to pay fees ranging from 10% to 50% of the ticket price to change or cancel any discount flight . Previously , the highest cancellation fee was 25% , and most fares requiring one-week and two-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It certainly says good things for the second half if we see more rational pricing , " said Edward J. Starkman , an airline research assistant with PaineWebber Inc . He called American ' s announcement " encouraging " for industry profits . But Robert Joedicke , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. , said he doesn ' t plan to revise any of his earnings estimates because he expected profits to improve anyway during the second half . The new structure might boost profits because some travelers who usually would use the advance-purchase fares might now be forced to pay full fares or accept a higher discount fare with a smaller cancellation fee . Some analysts were skeptical that American would be able to make its new fare structure stick . " It may just be pie in the sky to think that the industry is going to follow , " said David Sylvester of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco . " There are still enough loose cannons in the marketplace " that may force American to abandon its plan , he said . American said it hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to reverse course . " We ' re not locked into anything , " a spokesman said . " We haven ' t put on a pair of concrete boots . " Spokesmen for Miami-based Eastern Airlines and Trans World Airlines , New York , said the two carriers likely will begin something similar to American ' s plan , making market-by-market decisions . In St. Paul , Minn . , Northwest Airlines , a unit of NWA Inc. said it would match American ' s plan . Chicago-based United Airlines , a unit of UAL Inc. and the nation ' s largest carrier , and Minneapolis-based Republic Airlines said they could decide whether to match American as early as today . Atlanta-based Delta Airlines said it is studying the changes , and Houston-based Continental Airlines , a unit of Texas Air Corp. , declined comment on American ' s new fare structure . Analysts predicted that most major carriers would follow American , a unit of AMR Corp. , but said the danger is that low-cost carriers , like Continental Airlines and People Express Airlines , likely wouldn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major carriers . American ' s new fare structure would put it more in line with the simpler structure of most low-cost carriers . Many low-cost airlines recently have begun restricting their fares , but they have retained only a few fare levels and their fares have fewer restrictions than their major competitors . By contrast , the major carriers currently have dozens of different fare types . American ' s plan essentially would reduce this to six : first class ; full coach ; and advance-purchase discount fares requiring travelers to buy tickets seven days , 14 days , 21 days or 30 days before the flight . All would require round-trip travel and would require a stay over a Saturday night at the destination . On the 21-day and 30-day advance purchase fares , American will have peak and off-peak fare levels , charging $40 more round trip for flights Thursday through Monday than for flights on Tuesday and Wednesday . All other fares would be eliminated . For example , American offers three-day advance purchase fares in some markets . It also offers discount fares on one-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t carry any cancellation penalties . American said that while it may retain a few different fares in individual markets " for competitive reasons , " it plans to rid itself of more than 90 different fare types it currently has in its computers . The penalty for canceling or changing the cheapest 30-day advance purchase fares , which offer discounts of around 70% off full fare , will rise to 50% from 25% . And American will add a 10% cancellation fee to seven-day and 14-day advance-purchase fares , which offer discounts of about 20% and 40% , respectively . Neither fare previously had cancellation penalties . The 21-day advance-purchase fare  --  a level American previously didn ' t have  --  will offer discounts of about 65% off full coach and carry a 25% cancellation penalty .
