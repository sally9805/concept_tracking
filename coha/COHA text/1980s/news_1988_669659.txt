Ambroise Vollard , a Parisian art dealer from the early 1890s to the start of World War II , did just that . In fact he did it with unusual brilliance and foresight. // // Una E. Johnson has written : ' ' It is a recognized fact that most of the great paintings created during the last decades of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th had passed through Vollard ' s hands . ' ' This may be a slight exaggeration . But it is true that you can hardly read a book about any of the major artists of late-19th- and early-20th-century Paris without encountering Vollard. // He was the first dealer to give Cezanne ( in 1895 , when the painter was 54 ) a one-man show , and the first to exhibit Picasso in Paris , in 1901 , soon after his arrival from Spain . He encouraged Renoir , very late in his career , to start making sculptures - and got exclusive rights as agent for them. // Rouault occupied a studio in Vollard ' s residence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . And he stimulated the artist ' s interest in engraving , which became a central facet of his art . And it was Vollard who helped to make Gauguin ' s financially precarious self-exile in the south seas somewhat less impossible. // Vollard ' s enterprise was of benefit to his chosen artists as well as to himself . As his wealth grew , he spent much of it on publishing illustrated books and original prints , often by ' ' his ' ' artists , of high quality. // Vollard opened his gallery in the early 1890s , having come to the French capital from one of France ' s colonies , the island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean , near Madagascar . His father was a notary , and Ambroise was the eldest of 10 children . He claims he ' ' commenced collecting ' ' at the age of 4 . He wrote , ' ' I simply had a lively sense of property . ' ' At that time he collected pebbles and bits of broken crockery. // Eventually the young Vollard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure of art proved far more attractive , and he embarked daringly on his preferred career . He didn ' t care what anyone thought of him , least of all the other dealers and the general public , who were outraged by the art of les jeunes - the young and modern artists he espoused. // If Vollard turns up often in books about the period , his face and figure also recur in its paintings . It is clear from these portraits that the dealer - once described by another Parisian gallery owner , Rene Gimpel , as ' ' a sort of alert old bear ' ' - was recognized by his contemporaries as one of the more colorful individuals of the Parisian art world ; he became something of a myth in his own lifetime. // Gertrude Stein , the American writer , once drew an unnamed verbal silhouette - which Vollard recognized as himself . He refers to it in his ' ' Recollections of a Picture Dealer . ' ' He comments : ' ' . . . incapable though I am of putting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the silhouette Miss Stein has drawn of me I recognized myself at once , as the fellow leaning with both hands on the doorposts , glaring at the passers-by as though he were calling down curses on them . That is a thing seen . How many times have I not regretted that nature has not endowed me with an easy-going , jovial manner ! ' ' // By the 1930s , when Vollard had become a virtual recluse and no longer needed to sell paintings , he did admit to sometimes taking a rather high-handed attitude toward hopeful buyers . He refused to sell to some buyers because he wanted to retain his stock and watch the prices go up. // Such tactics must have been at the back of less-than-flattering characterizations like the one in Pierre Cabanne ' s book on Picasso : ' ' Ambroise Vollard was no ordinary man . He was said to doze most of the time , between naps turning away potential customers , for each time he awoke , the requested paintings had gone up in price . No one knew exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Rue Lafitte , where he crawled , virtually on all fours , among stacked Cezannes , Renoirs , and Gauguins. ' ' // But in the visual portraits of him , Vollard does not appear to be as cantankerous or eccentric as all this suggests . The almost-caricature of Bonnard ' s etching of him suggests massive amiability - that large , comfortable hulk completely swamping whatever seat was only just supporting him , his chin burying itself in his beard , his hefty hand poised to stroke the cat . The print is striking evidence of Vollard ' s appeal as an impressive , and also compliant , figure to depict . That he was also a sort of patron probably has bearing on the number of times artists portrayed him. // Vollard was a hospitable man . He was inexhaustibly fond of telling anecdotes . He wrote books on Cezanne and Renoir , and a volume of his own recollections that is really just a string of anecdotes . Many of these brief episodes ( though not always strictly accurate ) offer revealing insights into the artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sense of humor. // Vollard seems to have remained on fairly good terms with most of the artists whose work he bought ; Cezanne , particularly , could be very difficult indeed , but seems to have tolerated Vollard. // Vollard ' s description of how he sat for Cezanne is telling . It suggests not only Vollard ' s patience , but also the unrelenting and exacting character of Cezanne ' s efforts. // The dealer had to sit as still as a jug , and felt it necessary to be very careful not to say anything that could annoy the painter - who might at any moment have cut the canvas to shreds with his palette knife . After ' ' a hundred and fifteen sittings ' ' the portrait was abandoned , still unfinished , the artist observing that ' ' the front of the shirt is not bad. ' ' // Fortunately the picture survived in all its penetratingly solid frontality and rocklike repose. // As for Picasso ' s Cubist portrait of him , now in Moscow , Vollard tells a story about this ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can be about the difficulties of ' ' seeing ' ' Cubist paintings. // He wrote : ' ' The son of one of my friends , a boy of four , standing in front of the picture , put a finger on it and said without hesitation : ' That ' s Yoyard. ' ' ' // //
