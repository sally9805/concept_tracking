The book President Reagan apparently regarded last year as most important for his work is a novel about a limited nuclear war that results in the col- lapse of the Soviet empire . The New York Times Book Review asked Reagan and others what was " the most important book they read for their work and what was the best book they read for pleasure " in 1983 . Here is the President 's reply , in its entirety , as it appeared in the December 4 issue : " John Hackett 's The Third World War : August 1985 , ' Joanna Stratton 's Pioneer Women , ' and David Lamb 's ' The Africans . ' The Third World War , published in 1979 , is a former NATO commander 's account of a limited nuclear war fought in 1985 between the Soviet Union and the West . Pioneer Women is a description of life on the Kansas frontier , based on 800 women 's memoirs written down in the 1920s by the author 's great-grandmother . The Africans is a personal view of contemporary black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles Times there from 1976 to 1980 . From the order in which Reagan listed the three titles , we may deduce that he regarded Hackett 's as the most important book for his work in 1983 , Stratton 's as the most pleasurable and Lamb 's , apparently , as the second most important for his work . Strangely  --  even remarkably  --  the press did not ask him why Hackett 's book was so important to him . Until his retirement , in 1968 , Gen. Sir John Hackett was Commander in Chief of the British Army of the Rhine and the Commander of NATO 's Northern Army Group . The title page lists the authors as Sir John " and other top-ranking NATO generals and advisors , " and according to published reports , subsequently confirmed by Hackett , his collaborators included an air chief marshal , a vice admiral , a major general and a former British delegate to the organization , all retired . Several active NATO officials reportedly read the book before it was published . In his acknowledgments Hackett conveys the impression that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texas Observer , is the author of On Reagan , published by McGraw-Hill last year . originating in high-level alliance circles . " We have had invaluable advice , " he writes , " from a great variety of sources , including the Ministry of Defence in London , Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe , Allied Forces Central Europe , the British Royal Military College of Science , and elsewhere . " According to promotional statements in the paperback edition , British Prime Minister James Callaghan gave President Jimmy Carter a copy of the book " as a warning . " The New York Times reported that Carter was said to keep it next to his Bible in the Oval Office . When I asked Carter about this , he replied , " Mr. Callaghan gave me the book , not as a warning . I read it and did not keep it on my desk or near the Bible . " Hackett 's acknowledged purpose in writing the book was to stimulate a military buildup in the West by convincing his readers that given the balance of forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe in a conventional war . The writing in The Third World War is pedestrian , and much of the substance is dry and flat . Long passages on strategy and tactics , cast in the acronym-scarred gobbledygook of military history , are practically unreadable . The book 's commercial success is probably attributable to its quasi-official status and to the public 's anxiety about nuclear war . In Hackett 's first draft , Soviet troops occupy West Germany , apparently after it has been devastated by a nuclear attack . " It was made clear to me , " he later told Judy Klemesrud of The Times , " that NATO could not survive that . So . . . I tore up 30,000 words and started again . " Clearly , the general was deliberately manipulating the events in his story so that his war could end with the Western victory that President Reagan read about last year . According to the novel , in 1984 a Republican from the South , whom Hackett calls Governor Thompson , campaigned for the Presidency against " the soft-centered international liberalism " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In August 1985 , the Soviet Union invades Western Europe , using conventional weapons and chemical warfare ( nerve gas and the like , one assumes , although Hackett does not say outright ) . The battle is joined , and American F-4 Phantoms and U.S.-supplied British and West German artillery units retaliate in kind . After three weeks of fighting , the Soviet offensive is brought to a halt . The Russians also lose " the Battle of the Atlantic , " which Hackett describes with a kind c f fascination peculiar to the military mind . Hackett tells us that the Soviet strategists do not draw a sharp line between nuclear and conventional weaponry . " Nuclear and non-nuclear warfare had never been regarded in the Red Army 's philosophy as alternatives , " he writes . " Each fitted in as an element in a total war-fighting capability , to be exploited as policy and occasion demanded . " Nevertheless , in Hackett 's story a faction in the Politburo opposes the use of nuclear weapons , only to be outmaneuvered by what he calls the nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Russians become desperate and decide they will attack the city of Birmingham , England , with a nuclear bomb . This strike is to be accompanied by a demand that the United States agree that the world be divided into American and Soviet spheres of influence , " failing which further selective strikes would be carried out . " By portraying the Russians as losing the conventional war in Europe , Hackett avoids having the West use nuclear bombs first . Had he let the war go against the West , he would have had to deal with the well-known NATO doctrine that stipulates the United States will use nuclear weapons rather than lose to the Soviet Union in a conventional war in Europe . He bases the Soviet Union 's " first use " on the absurd idea that the Russians would believe they could successfully blackmail the West by destroying an English city and threatening further attacks . As Stanley Hoffman wrote in The New York Times Book Review concerning this , the Russians might use nuclear weapons first , " but it is not reasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply drop a bomb on one city and then sit back . It is just as plausible to assume that the NATO forces , having been pushed back , would be the first to ' go nuclear ' ( as NATO strategic doctrine provides ) . " Hackett has the Russians destroy Birmingham , a city of about 2 million people , with one nuclear warhead carried by an SS-17 missile . The explosion kills more than 300,000 people " within minutes " and flattens the center of the city . Hackett does not tell us how many more people die in the aftermath , although the events in the story are be.ing described as if he were writing two years later . " A few minutes after the detonation of the nuclear weapon over Birmingham , " Hackett and his NATO col-leagues write , " the President of the United States was speaking to the British Prime Minister . . . . It was at once agreed that immediate retaliation was necessary , if only to avoid a catastrophic decline in civilian and military morale . The French President was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American and a British submarine each fire two missiles at Minsk , a city of 1.25 million people in the western part of the Soviet Union . The submarines appear to be of the Polaris type , and each missile is armed with multiple warheads . If Hackett intended the missiles to be Polaris A-3s , which were first deployed in 1964 , they would have three warheads which are not independently targeted . ( Poseidon missiles , first deployed in U.S. submarines in 1971 , carry ten independently targeted warheads . ) In compliance with the orders of the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister , the French President concurring , the multiple warheads from the four missiles , " tailored exactly to their task , " explode " on target in quick succession . " Although he takes seventeen pages to describe the destruction and chaos in Birmingham , Hackett devotes only two sentences to what happens in Minsk : " The effect was cataclysmic . It was the horror of Birmingham repeated , only many times worse , scarcely mitigated at all by civil defense precautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , exploded among those 1.25 million people , killed nearly all of them . Now we come to the good part . The impact of the destruction of Minsk , Sir John writes , " was everywhere enormous but nowhere more so than within the Soviet Union and its satellites . " Minsk , he tells us , had been " a well-chosen target , close to Poland on the West , capital of the theoretically autonomous republic of Byelorussia , and the Ukraine 's neighbor on the north . " The Soviet satellites and colonies revolt , and soon there follows " the collapse of the U.S.S.R. " and , of course , " the collapse of the Warsaw Pact . " Confining oneself to well-known facts , one may be able to deduce what aspects of The Third World War : August 1985 the President found so valuable for his work . First , the book describes a limited nuclear war that does not become a worldwide holocaust . During Reagan 's first autumn as President he said , " I could see where you could have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without it bringing either one of the nuclear powers to pushing the button . " Second , the fictional American President , who has just defeated Walter Mondale , " agreed at once that immediate retaliation was necessary " and gave no thought to other responses that would have been less barbaric and possibly more effective . If Sir John feels any practical or ethical qualms about immediate retaliation ordered " to avoid a catastrophic decline in civilian and military morale , " he does not discuss them . Third , in retaliation for the explosion of a nuclear bomb over Birmingham , the United States and Britain loose perhaps a dozen nuclear warheads on Minsk , the consequences of which are " many times worse . " Hackett expresses no grief or ? remorse over the disproportionate Western response In fact , he tells us that when the Russians were deciding to explode their nuclear bomb , they reasoned : " It had to be expected that some retaliation would occur , but if the signals were understood this should be limited to a more or less comparable strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet and just . Fourth , in 1980 George Bush said that a nuclear war is winnable , and Reagan agreed that " you could start again " after such a war . By 1983 Reagan was declaring that " a nuclear war can not be won , " but according to a Pentagon five-year Defense Guidance leaked in 1982 , the United States " must prevail " in a nuclear war . In the book the President values , a nuclear war is won by the United States and its allies , leaving a " defeated " Soviet Union . Fifth , in Hackett 's war the joint U.S.-British nuclear attack is calculated " to spark off the explosions in subject nations which were in the end to bring the Soviet Union down . " The nuclear exchange " proved to be the trigger which set off the smouldering nationalist explosion . " Hackett 's nuclear war is not merely won , it is triumphantly won . Writing as if in 1987 , he muses , " What especially distinguishes the scene we now see about us is . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baleful , expansive , intractably dogmatic imperialism of Soviet Russia . " That brings to mind Reagan 's March 1983 speech to the National Association of Evangelicals : not the widely publicized declaration that the Russians are the " focus of evil " in the modern world but the little-noticed peroration . Since the spiritual source of our strength in the cause of human freedom has no limitations , Reagan told the evangelicals , it " must terrify and ultimately triumph " over the totalitarians . Seen not as a novel in the usual sense but as a parable ( which is the way one guesses that Reagan sees it ) , Hackett 's book teaches that the Russians may well invade Western Europe , that they are ready and willing to use nuclear weapons against cities , that the United States and Great Britain should retaliate against one Soviet nuclear bomb on a Western city with about a dozen on a Soviet city and that the glory-be consequences of such a war of conventional , chemical and nuclear weapons could be the final end of the Soviet empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of life in the Northern Hemisphere but to victory for the West In Hackett 's 1982 sequel , The Third World War : The Untold Story , he doctors the facts in very suggestive ways but keeps his main story line intact. * Reviewing the sequel in The New York Times , Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called attention to " a lot of wishful thinking involved in the gen " e Hackett names his collaborators , now including Soviet emigres Viktor Suvorov and Vladimir Bukovsky Making " some adjustment to the record , " Hackett backs off from the four-missile , multiple-warhead attack on Minsk Now it is " four missiles , each of between 200 and 300 kilotons " Although Minsk is " totally destroyed , " only 50,000 people are " killed instantly , " one-sixth the number so killed in Birmingham , and the suffering in Minsk is given five pages . Minsk is said to have been chosen " because of its general comparability with Birmingham " The Western peace movements are alleged to have been orchestrated and subsidized by the Soviet Union ( and in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fidel Castro and the emergence of a non-Communist Cuba are added benefits of the war eral 's scenario . " The disintegration of the Soviet empire , Lehmann-Haupt continued , " is just highly exhilarating as an exercise in fantasy . It 's almost dizzying to contemplate a world in which the Soviet empire is no longer a threatening presence . " In the President 's canon , another text helps further explain his high regard for Hackett 's book . Between 1975 and 1979 Reagan made hundreds of short ' radio broadcasts . In one of those in 1975 , the year before his first campaign for the Presidency , he gave his overview about the conflict with the Russians : The Russians have told us over and over again their goal is to impose their incompetent and ridiculous system on the world . We invest in armaments to hold them off , but what do we envision as the eventual outcome ? Either that they will see the fallacy of their way and give up their goal , or their system will collapse , or ( and we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use our weapons one day . As we read The Third World War , we do " let ourselves think of this . " That is why Ronald Reagan regards General Hackett 's book as important for his work as President of the United States . ?
