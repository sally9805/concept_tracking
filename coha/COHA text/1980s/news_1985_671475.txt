The announcement came as the crisis entered its third week amid signs that snags had developed in discussions with the Lebanese Shiite leader , Nabih Berri , and various governments and international organizations on how to resolve the standoff. // Mr. Berri has said he is mediating on behalf on the Shiite hijackers who commandeered a Trans World Airlines jet June 14 . The hijackers ' principal demand has been that Israel free more than 700 mainly Shiite detainees who have been held without charges for up to 19 months . <> <> News Blackout Maintainted // For a second day , the Reagan Administration maintained a news blackout on diplomatic efforts , which centered on Israel , France , Syria and Mr. Berri. // One well-placed American official , giving his personal opinion , said : " This may take longer to work out than you think . There are so many players that any one of them can hold it up. " // One approach under intense discussion on Wednesday - moving the 39 hostages to the French Embassy in Beirut , where they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - seemed today to have collapsed . <> <> Idea Described as Dead // Israeli sources said the idea was " dead . " Mr. Berri - who proposed Wednesday that the hostages might first be moved to a Western embassy in Beirut or to Syria - gave the same assessment in a CBS News interview. // France and Switzerland said in separate announcements today that they were willing to take the 39 American hostages into their Beirut embassies , but were not willing to act , in effect , as jailers . In Jerusalem , Israeli officials said tonight that they were still waiting for a clear signal from Washington before they reacted formally to any French , Swiss or other proposed initiatives for solving the crisis . Page A6 . The demand for the freedom of the seven missing Americans came after the Administration had asserted for days that the seven were in a different category from the 39 hostages from T.W.A. Flight 847. // Some officials here said the new insistence that " all 46 Americans " be freed held out the potential of delaying completion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Shiite Amal militia has had no control over those who might be holding the seven Americans and that Amal had been unable to find out where they were. // Six of the Americans are believed to be in the hands of militants who seized them in Beirut , and their whereabouts are unknown . The seventh , a librarian at the American University of Beirut who failed to show up for work in December 1984 , is officially listed as missing , and no group has claimed responsibilty for abducting him. // Diplomatic sources said Secretary of State George P. Shultz was in telephone contact on Wednesday with both Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel and Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France to discuss the possibility of moving the 39 T.W.A. hostages temporarily to the French Embassy in Beirut , with the Israelis following that up by announcing that they would release the 735 detainees. // But they said this effort had failed so far because the French Government had refused to hold the American hostages for more than 48 hours. // Mr. Dumas telephoned Mr. Peres , on Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detainees would be released promptly . But after an emergency meeting of his key Cabinet aides , Mr. Peres declined to make any promises about the timing of the release of the detainees . <> <> Clear U.S. Signal Sought // Israeli and French sources said today that the United States had to be much clearer about what it wanted them to do before their Governments could act. // When Mr. Berri proposed moving the hostages to the custody of a third party , his condition was that the government or governments involved agree not to free the Americans before the Israelis agreed to return the 735 detainees , who were taken from southern Lebanon in April . The United States and the International Committee of the Red Cross at the time regarded the transfer of the detainees to Israel as a violation of the Geneva convention dealing with civilians in occupied territory . Israel denies it violated the convention. // The initial American preference for moving the hostages , diplomatic sources said , was to use the French Embassy . But after the inconclusive discussions on Wednesday night , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American hostages with the conditions attached by Mr. Berri . Neither wanted to be in the position of being perceived as a new jailer of the Americans. // Washington , unwilling to appear to yield to the demands of the hijackers , has striven to insure that the release of the hostages and of the detainees would be seen as entirely independent steps . This makes it difficult for the Administration to ask Israel to agree to a prompt release of the detainees , and Israel refuses to do so on its own , without an American request. // It is believed that at least six of the seven missing Americans are under the custody of the shadowy Islamic Holy War group , which is based in Baalbek in eastern Lebanon . <> <> New Insistence in Shultz Speech // The first indication of the new stress on including the seven Americans in the group came from Mr. Shultz Wednesday night . He had flown to San Francisco for a dinner speech on the United Nations , and he inserted a paragraph on the hostages into the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grave significance not only for the United States but for the entire civilized international community , " he said . " Tonight , I have this and only this to say about the terrorism in Beirut . We are working intensively on this matter , and we insist on the return of our hostages , all 46 of them , immediately , unharmed and unconditionally. " // Today , both the White House and the State Department repeated with firmness that " all 46 " had to be freed. // Various explanations were offered for the new formulation that included the seven missing Americans . One was that the Administration was surprised on Wednesday when Mr. Berri announced that as part of his proposal , two of the four French citizens who had also been abducted in Beirut would be freed with the 39 Americans . He said the kidnappers of those two had contacted the Amal leadership and volunteered to return them . <> <> Demands From Relatives of 7 // The families of some of the seven Americans have been publicly calling in recent weeks for more determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T.W.A. hijacking on June 14 , relatives have been complaining publicly that the seven might end up forgotten if they are not freed with the hijacking victims. // It was unclear , however , whether the Administration would refuse to agree to an arrangement for the release of the 39 T.W.A. hostages that might otherwise be acceptable unless it include the seven other Americans. // Mr. Berri said in the CBS News interview that he would discuss with the hijackers , said to be from the extremist Party of God , a proposal by the Swiss Government that the Swiss be allowed to take the American hostages to Switzerland and free them , without regard to what the Israelis do about the detainees . But he said he was not optimistic this would be acceptable to the hijackers , who throughout have insisted on simultaneous releases. // Less was known publicly about the possibility of Syria ' s assuming responsibility for the hostages . A front-page editorial today in Al Baath , the organ of the ruling Syrian party , said Damascus was " actively helping in putting an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also criticized the United States for not doing enough to force Israel to return the detainees and for threatening military and economic retaliation against Lebanon . <> <> Contact With Assad Reported // Mr. Berri said Mr. Reagan had held telephone conversations with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria , but this could not be confirmed here. // On Tuesday , the White House said that if diplomatic channels do not produce a resolution of the crisis in " the next few days , " Mr. Reagan was ready to take economic and military action to close the Beirut airport and blockade Lebanese ports . It is not clear if this timetable is still in effect , given the latest flurry of diplomatic contacts. // Peggy Say , sister of one of the seven missing Americans , said today that the pressure of press coverage had led the Administration to link the release of their relatives with that of the T.W.A. hostages. // Mrs. Say - sister of Terry A. Anderson , an Associated Press correspondent kidnapped on March 16 - said she and relatives of some of the other six had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down. // " Then I look at television and I see President Reagan making time to meet with families from the T.W.A. airliner , " she said . " I felt like I had been slapped in the face. " // The White House said Mr. Reagan , while in Chicago on Friday , would meet with relatives of Father Jenco , the kidnapped priest. //
