HONG KONG  --  Making his debut in Hong Kong high society early last year with his Rolls-Royce and lavish parties , Luis Chang told an acquaintance that he owed his fancy life style to none other than China ' s aging leader , Deng Xiaoping . " The old fellow looks after me , " the hitherto obscure young man said . When next he started speculating in Hong Kong real estate , Mr. Chang again suggested that Mr. Deng was in on it , too . " I ' ve got to consult the old man before making a decision , " he would say in the middle of property negotiations . Not that he always sounded entirely convincing . But many Chinese officials did wine and dine with him as if they knew him well . One of them went so far as to sit on the board of his company , S. Zhong Shan International Investments Ltd . All this suggested that Mr. Chang must be some Beijing bigwig ' s offspring thrust into the capitalist world . So the Hong Kong business community embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , all involved seem to have fallen victim to Mr. Chang ' s excesses . Unable to raise the money he needed to pay for two big property purchases , he has had to forfeit 64 million Hong Kong dollars ( US$8. 2 million ) in down payments . Despite its denials , Beijing can ' t shake off the impression that it has had a part in his affairs . All this has left the local business community utterly perplexed . No one seems to know whether the fiasco is a result of official folly or just one man ' s speculative ruse gone awry . The backdrop for the Chang affair is Beijing ' s plan to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 . Anxiety over this prospect makes Hong Kong businessmen inclined to ingratiate themselves with anybody who claims a pipeline to China ' s leaders . And Beijing officials have ample excuse to wheel and deal in this capitalist hub . Starting with just a few hundred in the early 1980s , China-related concerns in Hong Kong now total more than 3 , 000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s profitable property market . China International Trust &; Investment Corp. , which is supposed to facilitate trade and investment , trades in Hong Kong real estate . So does the People ' s Liberation Army . The Guangdong Water Authority , a provincial unit in charge of fresh-water supplies , hasn ' t missed out either . As they proliferate , the Communist Chinese government is losing its grip even on legitimate Chinese companies that operate in Hong Kong , let alone others that enterprising officials or their kin run for personal gain . " It isn ' t easy to figure out which is and which isn ' t a genuinely Beijing-backed company , " says Vincent Lo , chairman of Shui On Group Ltd . Mr. Lo ought to know . Shui On is owner of Shui On Center , one of the two properties that Mr. Chang had agreed to buy  --  but didn ' t . Mr. Chang also defaulted after striking a purchase agreement for Hong Kong ' s Carlton Hotel . Mr. Chang hasn ' t surfaced since his problems became public knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be interviewed for this article . Before gaining notoriety , Mr. Chang claimed to be from Latin America  --  the son of Chinese emigrants made good . Only 27 years old , he is also supposed to have developed Canadian property and designed computer software in the U.S. But subsequent accounts make the mysterious young man seem an unlikely speculator  --  let alone a jet-setter with business interests spread over several continents . He has told at least one associate he speaks no English . Others involved in his transactions recall that , even when negotiations took place in the local Cantonese dialect , he rarely did much besides name a price . They say he seemed unable to keep up whenever the talks progressed to simple technicalities such as balance sheets . At that point , professional middlemen would take over . The stage for Mr. Chang ' s emergence was set by a social event  --  a big party that his company , S. Zhong Shan , threw Jan. 21 last year in the ballroom of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel . The event was billed then as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational projects in China and run by Communist Party officials . One of them , Feng Lingan , traveled from Beijing to give a speech for the occasion . In attendance was Qiao Zonghuai , China ' s No. 2 diplomat in Hong Kong and son of a former foreign minister . The party ' s cozy atmosphere suggested that Mr. Chang was endorsed by Beijing . To some who expressed curiosity about his wealth , he claimed he was an orphaned son of a Communist comrade of Mr. Deng , the Chinese leader . Going by this account , it is Mr. Deng  --  both associates were told  --  who gave Mr. Chang several hundred million dollars to start a business . Whatever the real story , last August Mr. Chang undertook the first of three transactions that grew rapidly in scale . That month he bought a 51% stake in a small listed construction firm , Sun On Estate Co. , for about HK$54 million . In October he committed HK$238 million to the purchase of the Carlton Hotel . And with his HK$2. 5 billion offer for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big spender helped send Hong Kong ' s stock market soaring . He claimed his local real estate interests totaled HK$7 billion . Once catapulted into the limelight , Mr. Chang said little publicly about his China ties . But the local press began drawing conclusions . Some recalled the Hilton party ; others noted that Mr. Feng , the Chinese official who spoke at that party , was an S. Zhong Shan director . Not surprisingly , consensus soon had Mr. Chang as a protege of some powerful Beijing figure . " Shui On Center buyer has Deng connection , " proclaimed a headline in the Nov. 22 edition of the South China Morning Post , Hong Kong ' s biggest English-language daily newspaper . But the excitement soon turned into confusion . On Jan. 3 , the foundation denied in a statement that it had any role in Mr. Chang ' s affairs . The only link was an investment arrangement through which he contributed to the charity . But even that link was said to have been terminated , as was Mr. Feng ' s appointment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place without the Chinese official ' s knowledge or consent . The official denial rattled the local business community . It also dealt a fatal blow to Mr. Chang ' s aspirations as a property speculator . Having made down payments of HK$50 million for Shui On Center and HK$14 million for the Carlton Hotel , he only had about two weeks before further payments were required . He tried to arrange joint ventures with developers . He offered the properties for sale . He implored bankers to help . All to no avail . Nowadays , no one professes to know who Mr. Chang is and precisely what his relationship is with the Chinese ruling elite . Says a local businessman who has represented Mr. Chang in some of his property negotiations : " If you were to make a movie out of everything that Luis Chang has said and done , people probably would say that such things never happen in real life .
