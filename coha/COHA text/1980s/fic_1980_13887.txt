The single setting is the brand new Haydakor Coffee House on Graben , or The Ditch , not far from St. Stephens , where the old man who is sometimes called THE LARK , unseen , is working his fingers vibrato upon the keys of his music-box and chanting falsetto something that sounds like homage to forgotten truth and places and people , and longing for the angels and light of the last place , so to put it . There is an easy indifference among the people in the Haydakor to the tensions of reality itself and the enjoyment of art , including the falsetto chant , although now and then one of the people at one of the four tiny round-top tables puts down his paper or book to put his head sideways in order to listen a little more . Two tiny round-top tables at which two dummies sit , each with a removable head , for variety from one scene to another . One table with handbag on newspaper , at which ALICE sits . A table , across the room , with book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody smokes cigarettes , cigars , or pipes . The coffee cups are bright red , the saucers dark black . Two other tables , for ALFIE and the GIRL , first at one table , then each at a separate table . The tables are painted bright chalk white . The dropcurtain is a large painting of various parts of Vienna brought together into something like a work of art . VAN Hayek , Bahrone ? ( Puts down cup of coffee ) p. 3 SCHMIDT Alec ? Aroon ? Who is Alec Aroon ? VAN Is that a name ? Are you Alec Aroon ? SCHMIDT Oh , no , Sigmund Freud . VAN I am the owner of the Haydakor Coffee House , this , Sigmund Freud , I am an expert in dreams . I would have been only a writer except that there is really less and less fame in it , and not very much money , either . VAN An expert in dreams ? How ? Why ? Who remembers dreams ? SCHMIDT I do , you do , but women especially do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women and children , now and forever . Women really dream . VAN Like that one over there ? Do n't turn quickly , she 'll know we 're talking about her . Desdemona , Cleopatra , St. Joan , Mata Hari , Florence Nightingale , and let me see who she said she was this morning when she came in and sat down . Oh yes , Lily of the Valley . ALICE Not Lily of the Valley , Sir . Lily of Laguna . Laguna , Laguna , do you understand ? Spanish for lagoon . A body of water . A mulatto , as I am , entirely imaginary , the darling of the English song-writer Leslie Stuart who went to Alabama and found her waiting and wrote his best song . Have you no sense of history at all ? Do you concern yourself only with fame and fortune ? Of course , of course , how silly of me , you are the owner of the Haydakor Coffee House . Well , then , bring me another coffee , please , and when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can look down into my bodice . Why do you do that ? p. 4 VAN Why do you believe I do that ? I do not do that . I am owner and waiter . I set down a small cup of coffee on a small saucer in a proper place on the small table . One coffee , please ! THE VOICE Ho . VAN Why do you announce a new character every time you come in and sit down ? Are you an actress ? Are you waiting to be called by Shakespeare or Moliere , or Lope de Vega ? ( The chanting stops ) SCHMIDT Lope de Vega ? You know about such people as Lope de Vega ? ALICE Something 's changed . What is it that 's changed ? Something 's different . I have got to get things straight . Something just happened . What was it ? Is there nobody else in Vienna who wants to understand everything ? VAN The Lark just stopped singing , that 's all , Madame . ALICE Do n't Madame me , whoever you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to stop . This is not Vienna if he is not singing . St. Stephens is not St. Stephens . Restored , to be sure  --  after the carnage of the battle of the monsters . Graben is not Graben , the Ditch is not the Ditch . You are not you and I am not Lily of Laguna if the Lark stops singing . Sing again , please . I command you to sing again . ( THE LARK begins a new chant ) I thank you , and I shall be kind to you with all of myself , as you see fit , if you dare . Oh , and this song is even better than the other . More human . We do not really need to be ashamed of being human , although it would be preposterous if we took pride in it . We have been taking pride in it since we learned to talk . It 's about time we tried not talking . Think of it , everybody going about his business in total silence  --  just looking , just smelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame . Oh , forgive me . Lily of Laguna . ALICE Thank you . You may put your hand anywhere you like . VAN Here , on top of your head , then ( To SCHMIDT ) @x Perhaps the statue of Schubert in the Park is seen on the screen , and a very familiar piece of his music is heard , such as " Traumerei , " to which ALICE moves as in dream-dance , while SCHMIDT holds his face high as if remembering or trying to think , while VAN moves among the tables at which dummy men and women sit , removing cups and saucers . A young man comes in cautiously , chooses a table , sits , and waves to the door , whereupon a young woman comes in , looks around , and goes and sits at the table . They look at one another while ALICE dances slowly around the table . The Schubert fades away , and is followed first by silence , and then by special tinkling music composed by an appropriate composer , perhaps Loris Tjeknavorian : music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marble-top table , as in vaudeville of Germany about a hundred years ago , along the lines of " Oh , Tannenbaum , " or " Silent Night . " Slowly , steadily a dream scene gives way to reality , or at any rate coffee-house reality . SCHMIDT Who ? I mean , who did you say ? Beethoven ? Was that the name you said ? Well , not that it really matters all that much , but I believe I can tell you this about Beethoven  --  he was not anything at all like your typical Viennese . I did n't know him . At least I did n't know him well , but Beethoven for a number of very important years of his life lived in our neighborhood , and now and then as a dog I saw him finding his way to a bone . He was very facial , there was much face to Beethoven . But behind the face was all that activity , you know . Music , but almost insane  --  but perhaps you prefer the music by the other Viennese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth is I do n't understand the part about the dog . I mean , if you really want to know , I do n't know who the dog is . At first I thought it was yourself , and since you are not a dog I presumed you meant dog as certain writers do , as when jolly young men speak to one another about jolly young women and say you dog you . And then I thought you were speaking of Beethoven , but not the man , you were speaking of Beethoven the dog , and I felt sure you had something in mind in this transformation that perhaps you would not be unwilling to explain . My work is simple , as we see , but God knows how swiftly I suspect all manner of complicated things , almost without question , and perhaps that is the secret of the success of the Haydakor Coffee House , only a short time on the Graben . People who come here suspect that anything they say or think or dream or remember , or forget , even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that Vienna neighborhood , or was it Beethoven ? SCHMIDT I believe the Lovers would like a coffee . Please inform them that if they will not be offended let it be with my compliments , and put a little brandy in each cup , if they like the idea . Ideas mean so much , you might say , to each of us while we are young , although of course we really never stop being young . The muscles settle down , that 's all . VAN The gentleman would like to offer you coffee , is that all right ? In other words , no charge . He also offers to have a drop of brandy poured into each cup , if you like . No charge . Is that all right ? ( The BOY looks at the GIRL , and they both nod to VAN , and then to SCHMIDT ) @x There is now a ballet in which breathing , inhale and exhale , ebb and flow , high tide and low tide , intermingle with touches of music by first Schubert , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally by the composer of the score for this work : " Tales from the Vienna Woods , " " The Blue Danube , " " The Dragonfly , " " Barcarole . " And from the Street the sudden participation of THE LARK . The LOVERS do an amateur pas de deux . ALICE invites SCHMIDT to dance , but he brings out his wallet and gives her a piece of currency which she folds and puts into her bodice . Quietude . VAN sets two coffees on the table for the BOY and GIRL. @x Music and dance interval SCHMIDT I gather , it comes to me in a manner of speaking , I tend to notice such things , it is not exactly a gift , it is rather the opposite of a gift , a taking away , but whatever it is , let me remark , if you do n't mind , that I gather this , which I feel I must make known . ALICE Are you talking to me ? ALFIE No , I believe he 's talking to me . Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , or in my rapture , did I forget ? THE GIRL Your rapture ? What about my rapture ? Which I am sure you somewhat suspect ? How terrible it is for me to be so fragile as to feel both rapture and terror , but it is the truth , I am absolutely in a panic about this thing . Why did we do it ? Surely he is talking to me , is that so , sir , whoever you are ? SCHMIDT Well , yes , and then again no , not really . What can I say in a casual conversation in a coffee house , in a little coffee-time idle chitchat ? What can I say to you that is not being said to you by everybody and everything all the time in the only language that has any meaning ? I refer to your joining of the human procedure . I refer to becoming a living party of the first part . I refer to being part of the continuation . I refer to the fact that you are at this moment a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true decisions and by that means keeps us all in place , give or take who each of us turns out to be or learns how to become . You are nature itself , indeed the whole universe with its endless solar systems growing in your belly , so what could I possibly say to you that could mean anything at all ? I am hushed by the hush of your connection to the reality of the happening in your belly , by the way you are still able to dance , and to dispute with your husband about who is who and what is what . p. 13 THE GIRL He 's not my husband , but let 's not make a big deal out of that , he is certainly the man I did not drive off . I certainly took part in the game , so all the things you said may turn out to be untrue , after all , is that not so ? SCHMIDT Please do not discourage me from the habit of believing that the things I say mean something . I have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory now and then , but I must confess not too often . If he is not your husband , why is n't he ? Is it because he is the husband of somebody else ? ALICE Or might it be slightly more accurate to say the wife ? I know such men , and I 'm rather fond of them as of course so is the dear child manufacturing herself and a smidgen of himself inside her belly for all of us to behold with incurable curiosity and even something like happiness . Of course she is fond of him , but not the way I am . She is fond of him as a man , and I as an amusing protest of nature itself against the rigidity of itself , nature quarreling with nature and all of it in the form of funny sayings , tones of voice , and gossip . He knows pretty much everything about everybody , now , do n't you , dear boy ? ALFIE What nonsense . What 's going on here ? This is silly . Why did you insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of any one of a dozen others ? Do you know these people ? Are they members of your family ? Have you brought me here to embarrass me ? What is this place , the Last Stop ? Are we all dreaming , or are we being dreamed ? Waiter , I insist on paying for my own coffee , although I can not afford to pay for the brandy , which was n't my idea in the first place . Kindly present me with the tab and I 'll pay and go . p. 14 VAN Everything is paid , but if you would like another coffee I will be glad to call out as I do , One coffee . THE VOICE Ho . ALFIE No thanks , I do not want another coffee . VAN Cancel one coffee . THE VOICE Ho . ALFIE This is where I came in , this is where I go out . THE GIRL What 's the matter with you ? ( He goes ) @x From far away a voice that might be Richard Tauber 's sings " Dein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large dog with a face that resembles Beethoven 's walks from the kitchen among the tables , and nobody pays much attention to him . He stands up , removes the mask , looks at it , puts it back on , gets down on his hands and knees and goes back into the kitchen . A soprano sings " Golden Days " by Franz Lehar or somebody , even though in The Student Prince it is always a tenor who sings that song . When she comes to " how we laughed , " she stops . There is silence , and she breaks into tears , but it turns out to be the Girl crying softly @x During the preceding interval of opera , ballet , tableau , or whatever , as perhaps each of the earlier ones , SCHMIDT has got up for a change of costume and character , nothing more than a coat or cape , hat or walking stick , something more haberdashic than profound . The same sort of thing has happened to ALICE . SCHMIDT , the father of the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . But each might just be the Step-Father and the Step-Mother , too . Their leaving of their places to make these superficial changes are to be noticed , and VAN is to go to them each time as if to confirm the old customer , or to be at the service of the new one. @x During this interval of song , dance , tableau , parade , mime , acrobatics , Olympic athletic events like weight-lifting until the world itself is hoisted overhead by somebody , during whatever constitutes this interval the voice of THE LARK out on the Graben , or the Ditch , comes so close as to be impossible not to listen to very carefully . And then as if from an old phonograph , and an early record is heard the voice of somebody like the famous singer Maria Jeritza , meanwhile ALICE coming back to her place , this time as a rather special street-walker , not showy at all , but somehow clearly available for special transactions involving half an hour or half a century if that makes sense and somebody can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
