World automakers do not rank among big league players until they sell their cars in the U.S. , the world 's richest auto showroom . Last week South Korea announced its bid for a place in that market . Executives of Hyundai Motor America , a subsidiary of South Korea 's largest industrial conglomerate ( est. 1984 sales : $10.3 billion ) , said that they will begin selling cars in the U.S. this fall . <P> Hyundai is nothing if not ambitious . Max Jamiesson , 51 , a former Toyota official who is the new executive vice president of Hyundai Motor America , told participants at the convention of the National Automobile Dealers Assoc. in San Francisco that his goal is to sell 100,000 vehicles in the 1986 model year . That would be less than 1% of the total U.S. market of 10 million vehicles and 4% of all imports vs. about 18% for all Japanese makes . But it would be far more than the 288 cars that Toyota sold in America in 1958 , its ) first full year in the U.S. <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a front-wheel-drive subcompact and a rear-wheel-powered compact , both made in its modern factory on an 86-acre site in the port city of Ulsan . This year the plant 's production capacity will be increased from 150,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year in anticipation of U.S. sales . Just what the subcompact will look like is known only to Hyundai officials , who have code named it the X car . It will be unveiled in March and is expected to sell for as little as $5,000 . That would make it cheaper than the Japanese-made Suzuki ( base price : $5,151 ) , a mini sold by Chevrolet as the Sprint in nine Western states and the lowest-priced car in America . The larger car , the Stellar , will begin at $7,000 . Hyundai intends to begin assaulting the American market in California , where the Japanese also started . <P> As a warmup for its American offensive , Hyundai last year introduced its Pony subcompact into Canada , anticipating sales of no more than 5,000 cars in the first year . Thanks largely to its attractive base price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales topped 25,000 , or 11% of the Canadian import market . <P> No one in Detroit underestimates the new challenge . Says Ford Chairman Donald Petersen : " The Koreans are bound to be one more very unsettling dynamic in the worldwide car market . " He believes the Japanese will export more up- scale models to the U.S. and leave the less expensive sector to Korea . <P> American auto-industry experts say that the biggest task facing the Koreans will be to manufacture cars that meet U.S. standards . Despite remarkable strides in the past few years , Korean automakers still lag behind Japan and the U.S. in quality production . The fits and finishes on Canada 's Pony , for example , are below par . Says Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald : " They 've got the will . The question is if they have the ability . " Hyundai officials admit they have a long way to go . Said H.B.
