" What on earth is going on in the Soviet Union ? " I asked Sochek , my shoe repairman . " The Soviet people have had it up to here , " Sochek said . " Gorbachev knows this so he is hoping to change the system without toppling the entire party . One of the worst things is the corruption . No matter what is going on , someone always has his hand out demanding a bribe . " " Can Gorbachev make a difference ? " " No , but they will print his picture in the newspapers showing him in a crowd , promising it . " " Why did you leave Russia ? " I asked . " I was in charge of manufacturing shoes in Minsk . My responsibility was to get them made before winter set in . You have to know a lot of people to get shoes made in Russia . It was no fun , but I did it . I had only one major problem . I couldn ' t get any heels for my shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pinsk . They said that they didn ' t have any heels and told me I should call back in two years . " How much will you take under the table for the heels you don ' t have ? " I wanted to know . " The manager told me , Four hundred rubles a heel . If you don ' t want them , the Smolensk Moccasin Cooperative will take all the heels they can get . ' I paid him under the table for the rubber . " " Where did you get the money to pay him ? " " Anyone in Minsk who wanted a pair of shoes had to pay me under the table . " " Nobody could complain about that as long as they got their shoes . " " That ' s the problem , " Sochek said . " They didn ' t get the shoes . Some big shot in Moscow ordered that my shoes be sent to his brother-in-law in Kiev . " " For which , " I wondered aloud , " he was paid under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stinks . Even corruption doesn ' t work in a Communist country . The bureaucrats are too corrupt to let it work . In a democratic society if you bribe somebody , he stays bribed . " " Did you get into a lot of trouble because you couldn ' t honor your contracts for the shoes ? " " The party chief in Minsk attacked me on local television for letting Marx and Engels down . He claimed that I was part of the Brezhnev era ' s do-nothing managers , who deserved 20 years of hard labor in Finsk . " " That sounds serious . What did you do ? " " Just what any loyal Soviet citizen would do . I bribed someone in the Ministry of Emigration to get me out of the country . " " I ' ll bet you didn ' t mind paying that final bribe . " " It wasn ' t the last bribe . What makes you think that you can get on a Russian airliner for just the price of a ticket ? " " It sounds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to change the Communist system you have to change the people who are running the country . How do you get them out of office ? " Sochek ' s eyes lit up . " The only way is to bribe somebody else to do it. "
