The circumstances were chillingly similar . Last Aug. 31 a small private plane took off from a suburban Los Angeles airfield , flew into the restricted airspace that protects Los Angeles International Airport without informing controllers , and collided with an Aeromexico jetliner . Eighty-two people died . Last week a single-engine Mooney aircraft lifted off from a municipal airfield 15 miles south of Salt Lake City , intruded without warning into the restricted zone around the city 's international airport , and struck a SkyWest commuter airliner . All ten people in the two planes were killed . <P> In each case visibility was excellent . In each , the pilots of the commercial aircraft were being guided by airport controllers . And in each , the small planes were flying under " see and avoid " rules in which controllers are not responsible for their flight paths . <P> " We 'll never know if anybody was looking out the window , " an air-traffic- control expert said of the two-man crew in the SkyWest Metro and the pilot and flight instructor occupying the Mooney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are monitoring a flight , is that someone must always be watching for other air traffic . When the two planes collided about 2,400 ft. above the Salt Lake valley , visibility was 20 miles . <P> Investigators said Pilot Chester Baker , owner of the Mooney , and Instructor Paul Lietz had been practicing " touch and go " landings and takeoffs at an airport near Kearns , Utah . At about 12:50 p.m . Baker touched down briefly , then lifted off and climbed sharply upward . The Metro , en route from Pocatello , Idaho , with six passengers and two crew members , was about to make a turn for its approach to the international airport . <P> The SkyWest aircraft " was inbound and doing exactly what he was supposed to do , " said Tom Doyle , an assistant air-traffic manager at the main airport . As for the Mooney , Doyle said , " I do n't know where that aircraft was . " Investigators said the Mooney may have been " squawking " with a transponder  --  a device that amplifies its radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one radar screen . If so , why had the controller not warned the commuter pilot ? A possible explanation : the Mooney was not transmitting information on its altitude , and thus the danger was not apparent . <P> The Mooney pilot , moreover , had not checked in with controllers as required . " He busted the ARSA , " said Don Moffit , a Salt Lake City tower manager , referring to the Airport Radar Service Area in which all planes must be directed by controllers . <P> The collision was a postscript to a year in which 828 near-midairs were reported to the Federal Aviation Administration . The agency 's boss , Donald Engen , noted that the FAA will soon introduce new air-collision warning devices for airliners and more sophisticated computers for the air-traffic control system , but he suggested that the " solution to the midair collision threat will still be the pilot . " There is no substitute , Engen said , " for a vigilant airman 's eye . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
