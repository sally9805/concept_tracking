The buyer was Jerry J. Moore , a 58-year-old Houston shopping center tycoon , who in an interview before the auction had called the Bugatti " ugly . " The car was one of more than 230 classic cars from the collection of the late William F. Harrah - regarded as the finest collection of its kind in the world - up for sale during the weekend. // Mr. Moore opened the bidding at $3 million and it jumped quickly to $5 million , when other bidders , including Thomas Monaghan , the owner of the Detroit Tigers , dropped out . Then the bidding settled into a duel between Mr. Moore and William Lyon , chief executive of Aircal airline . In successive bids greeted by cheers from a large audience , they raised the price until Mr. Lyon dropped out at $6 , 450 , 000. // // ' Ugly Enough to Be Unusual ' // Asked how he felt about his purchase of the 1931 Bugatti Royale Berline de Voyage , Mr. Moore said , " I was happy to buy it for less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the car to Houston ? " Probably , " he said . In the pre-auction interview , Mr. Moore had called the Bugatti a " very ugly car , but ugly enough to be unusual. " // The previous auction record for a car was set last June , when a Rolls-Royce purchased in 1966 by John Lennon , painted in a psychedelic motif and used by the Beatles went for $2. 3 million . <> <> End of the Harrah Collection // The sale of the Bugatti in the Reno-Sparks Convention Center was the highlight of a weekend auction at which the collection of Mr. Harrah , the Nevada gambling tycoon , was dissolved . It was put on the block by the Holiday Inn hotel people , who acquired the collection six years ago when they purchased Harrah ' s hotels and casinos , and then spurned international appeals to keep the collection intact. // Piece by piece , the collection - exquisitely restored Packards , Marmons , Duesenbergs , Rolls-Royces , Pierce-Arrows and cars bearing other classic marques from a bygone era - came apart today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the cars , two airplanes and railroad equipment were up for bid. // Although many rare cars were on the block , the Bugatti Royale dwarfed all others in its value and importance to collectors . At almost 20 feet along , it is one of the longest production cars ever made and one of the rarest . Completed in 1931 , with an original price tag of $42 , 000 , and tailored for the carriage trade of the Depression , the car is one of six Bugatti Royales still known to exist . Only seven were made. // Of the other five , one will remain here for display in a new Harrah ' s museum ; one is at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn , Mich. ; one is at the Briggs Cunningham Museum in Costa Mesa , Calif. , and two are the Schlumpf Collection in Mulhouse , France. // The yellow and black Bugatti weighs more than 7 , 000 pounds - more than two and a half times the average weight of American production cars - and is powered by a 300-horsepower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge car was once sold for $1 , 500 by European aristocrats briefly made impecunious by World War II . It gets about 10 miles to the gallon. // Even before tonight ' s event , the final dissolution of Harrah ' s automobile collection had been a most unusual sale of used cars . Mr. Moore , whose net worth has been estimated at more than $700 million , had started the day with a winning bid of $70 , 000 for a handsomely restored blue 1938 Bugatti 4-door sedan. // Mr. Moore is a one-time vacuum cleaner salesman who said he went into business " with minus nothing . " <> <> Had No Car When He Was Young // " I buy cars , " he said , " mainly because when I was a kid I didn ' t have one . Second , they ' re good investments , one that 10 years from now will have done considerably better than C.D. ' s , a savings account or anything else. " // Mr. Moore , with a $40 million line of credit for the auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have established credit lines of more than $1 million each . Most of the high rollers - some of whom are looked askance at by less affluent collectors as publicity-seeking plungers who artificially inflate the marketplace - are entrepreneurs and corporate executives. // Among those expected to play major roles are Mr. Monaghan , founder of Domino ' s Pizza , who paid $1 million for a 1929 Duesenberg at an earlier auction of Harrah ' s cars ; Jack Nethercutt , chairman of the Merle Norman cosmetics company , the owner of an $800 , 000 Duesenberg ; Mr. Lyon , who once paid $710 , 000 for a 1934 Packard , and Robert Bahre , a wealthy businessman . Malcolm Forbes , the publisher , said he might appear as a bidder. // The collection was put together by a man who regarded automobiles as works of art and gathered them up as if he were a Rothschild collecting old masters . During the Great Depression , while operating a nickel-a-card bingo parlor in Venice , a coastal town near Los Angeles , Mr. Harrah made a discovery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when times are tough. // Within a few years he had moved from Venice to Nevada , where he began creating a gambling empire in Reno and later at Lake Tahoe that would make him wealthy enough to cater , in an obsessive way , to a boyhood fascination with cars . Sending scouts worldwide looking for rare cars and entire collections , he amassed what became , by far , the largest collection of automobiles in the world , along with a smattering of airplanes , boats and railroad rolling stock. // He assembled more than 150 specialized mechanics , upholsterers , painters and other expert artisans to restore the cars to factory condition . If a part was missing , it was duplicated by hand in one of his workshops. // Mr. Harrah exhibited the cars in a warren of buildings in the town of Sparks , just outside Reno . It was a seemingly endless panorama of more than 1 , 400 cars - virtually every kind ever made . Lined up bumper to bumper , they were a unique showcase of what has been called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws allowed Mr. Harrah to satiate his desire and fulfill his dream of owning at least one model of every important car ever made . Because the cars were owned by his corporation and displayed in a museum that was an adjunct to one of his casinos , he could spend millions on the collection that might otherwise have gone as taxes on his casino profits . His goal , he said , was to take the cars out of the warehouse and build a huge theme park called Autoland . <> <> A Kind of Tax Shelter // But death , and his use of the collection as a kind of tax shelter , caught up with him . Mr. Harrah died in 1978 at the age of 67 , and in 1980 the casinos and other properties were purchased by the Holiday Inn organization , now known as the Holiday Corporation . With them went the cars . The auction , conducted by I.T.T. Kruse International , which handles most major auctions of collector cars in the country , began with an apology . Richard Wells , a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible for Holiday to keep the cars because " they were corporate assets in a public company. " // " Many have viewed the sale as a tragedy , " he said , " but there ' s another way to look at it . " Once sold , Mr. Wells said , the cars will be put on display and enjoyed by their new owners. // His voice choked , Clyde Wade , curator of Harrah ' s car collection , said of its dissolution : " It ' s been like the breaking up of a family . We ' ve had some great times , and we ' ve had some sad times . Now we won ' t see the collection as it has been ever again. " //
