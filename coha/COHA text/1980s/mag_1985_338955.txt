Can microchips mix with potato chips ? Do electric typewriters go well with pasta ? Will photocopiers blend with hamburgers ? Far from being a recipe for corporate indigestion , this is just the kind of formula favored by Carlo De Benedetti , 50 , chairman of Olivetti , Italy 's giant maker of office automation and data-processing equipment . <P> Three months ago , De Benedetti , through a family holding company , became the principal owner of Industrie Buitoni Perugina , one of Italy 's largest food producers . Last week he took another big bite by announcing that he would pay $250 million for 51% of SME , a food subsidiary of IRI , the Italian government 's vast holding company . The acquisition package includes more than 14 companies , which have 20,000 employees , operate 300 restaurants and 80 supermarkets as well as plants turning out everything from ice cream to tomato paste . Buitoni and SME together will have annual revenues of $2 billion . <P> Last week 's deal added luster both to De Benedetti 's reputation as a manager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his trademark for his nearly eight years at Olivetti . Says he : " This is the first time in Italy that a private businessman bought a state-controlled company and ! paid for it with real money , not pieces of paper or promises for future returns . " After the new agreement is completed , Olivetti and the Buitoni- SME food group will remain separate corporate entities , but they will both come under De Benedetti 's direction . <P> When De Benedetti took over in 1978 as Olivetti 's managing director , the company was almost moribund . It had not paid a dividend in four years , had more than $1 billion in debts and was losing $6 million a month . Olivetti is now the most profitable Italian industrial company . Last year sales increased 22.5% , to $2.6 billion , and profits rose to $201 million . <P> Putting companies together is nothing new for De Benedetti . He earned a degree in engineering from Turin 's Polytechnic in 1958 and ten years later took over as manager of his father 's flexible-metal-pipe plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the younger De Benedetti expanded the firm by buying up small , mostly unprofitable companies . By 1976 his company was Italy 's largest producer of car components and had annual sales of more than $46 million . <P> That same year , De Benedetti accepted the post of managing director of Fiat . But after 100 days on the job , he submitted his resignation for reasons that neither he nor Fiat has ever revealed . In early 1978 , Olivetti 's board of directors offered him the same job with its company . He bought $17.3 million worth of the stock to become Olivetti 's largest shareholder . <P> At the time , Olivetti sorely lacked the kind of foresight and strategic thinking necessary for a company in modern office equipment . Among De Benedetti 's first moves was stepping up research and development  --  from $28.3 million in 1978 to $130 million last year . He abandoned the manufacture of money-losing mechanical equipment like typewriters . He also began paring down a swollen payroll .
