The test was granted by the presiding judge , David S. Ritter of Orange County Court , who wanted some evidence that Miss Boudin did not have a violent past before he would agree to the reduced charges . Her lawyers insisted that she had never acted violently , even during the robbery , and Kenneth Gribetz , the Rockland County District Attorney , said he knew of nothing to the contrary. // She had not been armed during the Brink ' s incident , Mr. Gribetz wrote in a letter to the judge during the talks that led to the plea-bargaining agreement , " nor do we have evidence to prove she shot anyone . " He added later that neither the Federal Bureau of Investigation nor any other law enforcement agency had evidence that she " ever shot a weapon or took a human life. " // A lie detector test was suggested and Judge Ritter agreed . " She had to pass that test for the agreement to take effect , " said Leonard I. Weinglass , one of her lawyers , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years to life in prison and be eligible for parole in 2001 , at the age of 58 . <> <> Trials Were Moved // One guard and two police officers were killed on Oct. 20 , 1981 , during the $1. 6 million robbery in Nanuet and in a shooting that occurred when the robbers were stopped at a roadblock in Nyack , in Rockland County . One trial was moved from Rockland to Orange County because of possible prejudicial publicity . The trial of Miss Boudin and one other defendant was then moved to Westchester County for the same reason. // Mr. Weinglass said that " the case , as a whole , was only marginally tryable and we felt from the start that we would have to find a propitious moment to make the bid " for the plea bargain . That moment came , he said " when we perceived a change in the perception of Kathy. " // Mr. Weinglass spoke briefly outside the eighth-floor courtroom of Westchester County Court yesterday and elaborated today in his Manhattan office . " She was seen originally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was gradually mitigated by what the judge saw every day in court , what the prosecutor learned from evidence in the Federal trial and interviews of Kathy in The Village Voice and The Washington Post. " // What Judge Ritter saw was an alert , involved and nondisruptive defendant , in contrast to three other defendants in the first trial who had shouted slogans and insulted him . As for the Federal trial , a separate but related action in Manhattan , " informers testified they had never met Kathy , " Mr. Weinglass said , while the two published interviews of Miss Boudin in jail portrayed her sympathetically . <> <> ' She Was Peripheral ' // " Then it came down to a question of whether she was peripheral or central to the crime , " Mr. Weinglass said . Mr. Gribetz , he added , " had made her a central figure , but in reality she was peripheral. " // Although her role in the robbery was that of " backup , " or " providing and driving getaway vehicles , " as Mr. Gribetz had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a participant . And as a participant , even a peripheral one , in a robbery that results in murder , she shares responsibility for that murder under felony murder law. // " We thought a jury would acquit her of the murders of the police officers " who were shot at the roadblock when Miss Boudin had her hands in the air , Mr. Weinglass said , " but the felony murder of the guard was another matter. " // So the stage was set for Miss Boudin , who is 40 years old , to admit complicity in the death of the guard . And it was up to Judge Ritter to grant his approval for the reduced sentence instead of three consecutive terms of 25 years to life . That was when he sought additional evidence that there was no violence in Miss Boudin ' s past . <> <> Lie Test Is Arranged // It was agreed that Nat Laurendi , a retired New York City police detective who is an expert in administering polygraph tests , would be asked to come to the Rockland County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Weinglass. // She was asked 10 questions , including three that pertained directly to violence , according to a law enforcement source . The three questions were : had she sought to distract police officers at the roadblock , had she been armed during the incident and had she ever been involved in a bombing or shooting or any other violent act. // Miss Boudin answered no to all three and passed the test , according to Mr. Weinglass . He was asked if Miss Boudin ' s presence in a Greenwich Village town house that blew up in 1970 , while it was being used by radicals as a bomb factory , represented involvement in a violent act. // " She was asleep on the fifth floor when the explosion occurred , " Mr. Weinglass said . The three who died in the explosion , he added , " were all in the basement . " She was a fugitive after the blast until she re-emerged in the Brink ' s case. // Meanwhile , the trial of Samuel Brown , who had been Miss Boudin ' s co- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Court officials say that concrete barriers will remain in place around the building , while metal detectors will continue to be manned in the lobby and on the eighth floor. // Court officials also are indicating that the metal detectors , similar to those used at airports and some other courthouses , may remain in place after Mr. Brown ' s trial . Guards have indicated informally that they have been surprised by what has been uncovered by the devices - from knives to a gun. // Mr. Brown , 43 , a former convict identified by Mr. Gribetz as " one of the shooters " in the Brink ' s incident , is undergoing a competency hearing . Two court-appointed psychiatrists who tested him during a three-week period have testified that he is competent to stand trial . Judge Ritter will make the final ruling. // Mr. Brown , who has said he was severely beaten by law enforcement officers while in jail , also will undergo a brutality hearing next week .
