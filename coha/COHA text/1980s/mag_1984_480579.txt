CASPAR w . WEINBERGER . I can assure Your Highness that this is a very good agreement and that it 's to the advantage of the Arabs , or at least of one Arab nation . It is n't a perfect agreement , but it establishes the principle of Israeli withdrawal from an Arab state , and that in itself should receive the support of the Arabs , and especially our friends among them . The United States is depending on its friends to accept the agreement so that they can persuade other nations to accept it . SULTAN : In reality , I know what my esteemed friend Weinberger means . Every day I read and hear in the newspapers and on television that the key to the whole solution is in the hands of the Saudis and that the Saudis are able to force the Syrians and the PLO to withdraw . There is to this talk some exaggeration .. n is true the Kingdom works quietly and in special ways , without any threats or hysterics , but our influence with the Syrians is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave these matters to His Loftiness the King , to President Reagan , and to the exalted Minister Shultz . I and my good friend Weinberger are ministers of defense , and it is not for us to trespass on the internal affairs of other ministries . We should speak about defense matters only . WEINBERGER : I agree with Your Highness . There are two matters concerning defense that I 'd like to discuss with you . I assure you that discussing them wo n't be considered interference in the affairs of Secretary Shultz and Prince Saud . These two matters worry us , and I 'm sure they worry you even more . One is the increased Soviet presence in Syria the increase in the number of Soviet ex-perts as well as in the number of SA-5 and S10 sic missiles , which , according to our information , are capable of being equipped with nuclear warheads . Syria has become another Afghanistan , but with no official Soviet donqUest . It 's a friendly invasion . The Syrians believe the Russians are giving them the missiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria , but of course this is n't so . As Your Highness mentioned at our last meeting in Riyadh , the Russians are looking for murky water to fish in and warm water to sit in . After the embarrassing failTHE DISINFORMED Maybe , by Craig S. Karpel ure of Soviet weaponry last year , they want to prove via the Syrians the good quality of their weapons . Their arms sales have dried up in most of the Third World . Countries are turning elsewhere for arms especially to France and to another country . Also , there 's the war between Iraq and Iran , which we can classify as entering the attrition stage . Secretary Shultz reported to me about his meeting with Mr. Tariq Aziz two days ago . Mr. Aziz conveyed Iraq 's desire to end the war and to stop the killing of so many young men from both nations . According to the information we have , Iraq has the desire and the ability to cease hostilities almost unconditionally . However , it seems that the leadership of Iran wants personal revenge against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are dying by the hundreds every day . We feel that our friends ' itifluence is im-  --  portant at this point because Syria his good relations with the Tehran regime . All of this has begun to have a very dangerous effect on Lebanon , and by that I mean the increase of Shiite extremism in Baalbek and in the Bekaa. which Iran feeds and Syria protects . U.S. policy is to remain completely neutral in this war , and we are n't going to sell any weapons to either side . We have no connection with either side , but we support efforts that may persuade both sides to agree to a cease-fire and negotiations . As you well know , we 've been working quietly to keep the war from spreading , and within this framework we 've attempted to improve our relations with Iraq . The meeting between Mr. Shultz and Mr. Aziz was part of this effort to extend contacts between us and Iraq , as you know . But to our distress , one thing that has prevented , the continuation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding terror , especially by groups such as Abu Nidal . SULTAN : In realitt I &gee; with my friend the exalted minister about all the points he mentioned , and we are trying our best to help Iraq remain steadfast , but the United States has to take a bigger role in this area . WEINBERGER : To the great distress of the United States , we do n't have relations with the two sides and have no influence on them . Of course , we 're working quietly by diplomatic means and recently succeeded in bringing both sides together to discuss the problem of the oil spill in the Gulf . We hope these contacts will result in further contacts . SULTAN : In reality , I would like to discuss with the exalted minister the matter of cooperative defense and military efforts between the Kingdom and the United States . It is true that we are in continuous contact by means of the American-Saudi mutual consultations . However , Prince Bandar informs me that the Reagan Administration until now has not presented the Kingdom 's request for twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get 4111 them as soon as possible , because the Iranian danger increases every day . Our pilots are ready , and every day a new group of pilots is graduated . In reality , we now have more pilots than aircraft . And we should get planes from any side to keep our pilots always ready . This , in reality , causes a problem for us . WEINBERGER : Your Highness , let 's speak frankly . SULTAN : Yes . Yes , frankness before anything . We should speak frankly because we are friends . And between friends there should always be frankness . This has been the nature of our relationship for more than twentyyears . WEINBERGER : All right . In all frankness ? we know that you 're in contact with the French regarding acquisition of armaments as well as aircraft . This is all right . This is no business of the United States . It 's the Kingdom 's business . We do n't want to interfere with your internal policy regarding weapons acquisitions , but the United States is ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft . Though I suggest that we should n't present this matter to Congress before 1984 , and it 's better after 1984 . I assure Your Highness that , as Prince Bandar is aware , President Reagan does n't know anything about your request . There 's a sensible reason for that . As you know , the government suffers from the problem of leakage of classified information . If we were to pass on your request to the President , the matter would leak to Congress and the press and it would be difficult to supply new weapons to the Kingdom . PRINCE BANDAR : If the exalted prince and Mr. Weinberger will permit me ? in reality , we would like to buy non-American weapons for exactly that reason . We do not want to face a new battle like the AWACS battle . In reality , the AWACS battle was an embarrassing and scandalous situation for the Kingdom , although we won in the end .. Also , the Saudi air force wants to diversify its weapons and aircraft . It would be a mistake militarily for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of weapons and aircraft . At the time of the AWACS battle , the United States promised to sell us a squadron of F-15 aircraft and to supply us with bomb racks and fuel tanks . WEINBERGER : No , no , no ! Please wait . I do n't think we promised you . BANDAR : Yes , the AWACS covered everything . But nobody has brought up the F-15 matter again , and we have not received the additional bomb racks for the planes we have or the additional fuel tanks . WEINBERGER : I think General ( Wendelmeyer ) discussed that matter . GENERAL ( WENDELMEYER ) : This week we discussed this question with the responsible parties at the National Security Council in Washington . And think the council is preparing a report on the subject that will be ready next week . WEINBERGER : Can we give a copy to Prince Bandar when the report is ready ? But I 'm able to say at this time that the report says the United States is n't comfortable with the Kingdom 's trying to buy non-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf state that 's done this . Kuwait and other nations in the Gulf have begun to buy French weaponry and Mirage 2000 aircraft . There 's public criticism that I 'm always traveling to sell American weapons , but I think that Mr. Hernu , the French defense minister , is a good deal ahead of me . In any case , the only thing that worries us is the future of the ( Riyadh ) RIADS ( Regional Integrated Air Defense System ) program , which demands a uniform infrastructure of weapons and aircraft to create a unified air-defense system to protect the Gulf states . If the nations of the Gulf are going to buy non-American weapons , we 'll be forced to radically change the structure of the RIADS system , and that 'll cost a lot of money and time . All the effort we 've invested in structuring this system will have been in vain . SULTAN : In reality , if my exalted friend Weinberger will allow me ? after the AWACS battle , the Kingdom lost its desire to work with the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be presented to Congress until after 1984 , and this , in reality , is our problem with America . ? Whenever we begin to present any idea , only a short time is left , in the president 's term and he is busy with the election campaign . You always ask us to postpone everything until a new Congress is chosen and a new president is elected . Frankly , if this Administration ? or any administration , Democratic or Republican ? raises a battle like the AWACS battle , the Kingdom will be forced to change its defense policies completely , because our enemies are many and they use the nearest chance to attack the Kingdom , the royal family , and its honor . They produce cinema and television films about the royal family . Every day we see an article ANNOTATION 53 about extravagance and corruption . This does not suit us . It is understandable that you have a democratic system and understandable that you are not able to shut up the newspapers . Yes , but- WEINBERGER : There are other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington I suggest that Prince Bandar meet with General ( Se-cord ) and General ( Wendelmeyer ) to find a suitable way of solving the F-15 problem . Now , with your permission , Your Highness , I 'd like to move to the matter of the M-1 tanks . SULTAN : Excuse me . If my dear friend will allow me , before we discuss the M-1 tanks ? we have heard that the United States is going to supply Israel with motors to produce an advanced aircraft ... WEINBERGER . Yes , yes , you mean the Lavi aircraft . Israel will produce this plane in the 1990s . The military relations between us and Israel are extremely important to Israel 's security preparedness , and also to force her to back down from inflexible positions in Arab-Israeli negotiations . If we do n't give assurances to Israel , and if we do n't give her guarantees of this nature to ensure her security , she wo n't negotiate with us about matters that concern us and our Arab friends . In other words , at times we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up her rigid positions . In the last few weeks , during the negotiations that Secretary Shultz arranged between Israel and Lebanon , Israel gave up a lot and made concessions on many difficult demands that Lebanon was n't able to accept . Israel would n't have done so if President Reagan had n't decided to free the planes that had been blocked . Was something said about the M-1 ? SULTAN : Yes . In reality , this is a subject that concerns us . Much time has passed and it is still not known if the Kingdom will get these tanks , and when , and how many . Prince Bandar told me . WEINBERGER : Your Highness , permit me to say that the delay was n't from our side . We 've been trying for more than a year or a year and a half to persuade you to come to the United States to see a demonstration of this new tank , but you never agreed to do that . And now we 've agreed to your wishes and are going to bring the tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them may join the Rapid Deployment Force exercise that 'll take place in the Gulf this year . But as you know , the American Army does n't have this kind of tank yet . On the number we can agree , but delivery wo n't begin before 1986 , ' 87 , or ' 88 . General ( Wendelmeyer ) may know the number . SULTAN : The truth is , if my dear friend will allow me ? frankly , if there is a problem in America and in Congress about these tanks and their sale to the Kingdom , we do not want them , because we do not want to open a battle like the AWACS battle . About 54 HARPER 'S / AUGUST the number : if we ask for 2,000 , you will tell us , " No , 1,000 is enough , " and if we request 1,000 , you will tell us , " 500 is enough . " In reality , we want to get as many as we can . Prince Bandar reminded me that the Gulf maneuvers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't expect a battle with Congress on the matter of the tanks and their number because our dealings with the Israelis show us that they are n't going to stir up any opposition ? perhaps they 'll stir up token opposition . The number will be decided by the capability of the Saudi army to absorb the tanks . And I assure Your High* ness that there wo n't be differences of opinion between us on this matter . SULTAN : Of course not . We hope there will not be differences of opinion on any matter . WEINBERGER : I see that Ambassador ( Catto ) is signaling me that the time has come to return to Washington . Unless you have another subject you want to bring up before we finish this meeting . SULTAN : As you wish . wErliBERGER : A group from the Pentagon will come to the Kingdom in the near future to discuss the CENTERCON system and to set up forward head quarters with you . I think that our correspondence last year and this year and also the Gulf situation are creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as possible . Prince Bandar has told me that the Kingdom is ready , but without drums and bugles . We 'll stay in touch . We 're happy that Prince Bandar will be in Washington , because it 'll make it easier for us to develop a direct line of communication with you . Before we leave we 'll stay in touch , and in the meetings in the coming days I hope we 'll find satisfactory solutions for you and for us on the subjects of the F-15 , the M-1 , and CENTERCON . SULTAN : Good . And I would like to thank the exalted minister . WEINBERGER : If reporters surround us on our way out , I think it 's appropriate that we say that our meeting was in the framework of the periodic meetings we have in the context of the Saudi-American joint committee , and that we 've discussed matters of defense that concern the two countries . I do n't think the reporters will be satisfied with this , but ? SULTAN : I think the reporters already wrote in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meeting . WEINBERGER : No doubt . Henry E. Catto Jr. , assistant defense secretary . Latin characters in al-Safir . Actually , USCENTCOM . " Auditory error " suggests ? contrived to suggest ? ? transcription from tape . USCENTCOM is based at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa . Forward headquarters since December 1983 is aboard USS LaSalle , flagship of U.S. fleet in Persian Gulf . But here , HQ to be ( in Arabic ) " Ldctikum . " No way of knowing original English locution ? if there was one . Arabic implies HQ on Saudi territory . If true ( unlikely ) , explosive revelation . United States long eager for land HQ . " Confirms " HQ planned for Saudi soil . If HQ on a ship , for what must Saudi Arabia be ready ? Passage seems to rule out U.S. origin for " protocol . " Could Saudis be running HQ up flagpole to see if anyone cuts it down ? Could it be Saudi whistle-blow from Crown Prince Abdullah 's traditionalist camp , exposing Sultan 's Occidentophilia ? " Protocol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be marble cake of fact/ blarney ? an accurate account , leaked by Saudis to show noncollusion with United States over Syrian pullout , into which hostile player inserted USCENTCOM fib , burr under Saud 's saddle . There is some truth to nearly every story in leftist Arab press . But separating the wheat from the chaff in masterworks of disinformation is complicated by the difficulty of telling the fake wheat from the real chaff.
