They ' re called hard-core unemployables , discouraged workers or the army of unskilled nonworkers . They are Americans who would like to work but have given up looking . They lost their jobs for a variety of reasons , including layoffs , plant and office closings or relocations , phaseouts of their departments , being replaced by modern technology or offshore manufacturing or being fired . They ' ve looked and looked for work but believe they have no chance of being hired . Today , unemployment for women and men is 6 percent for each , a total of more than 7 million people . But discouraged workers are not included in the statistics of the nation ' s unemployed . In a separate counting , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 6 million Americans in the doleful category of " nonworkers . " And a startling 67 percent of these labor force " dropouts " are women . An economist pondering that statistic is Barbara R. Bergmann , professor of economics at the University of Maryland in College Park , Md . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women , " ( Basic Books , $19. 95 ) . A veteran researcher on women ' s economic issues , she views the discouraged worker from a sociological and statistical point of view . " In a way , these are the saddest of the unemployed , " Bergmann said . " They are people who would like jobs , would like to work , would like to support themselves and their families , and who , at least for the moment , have lost hope . " She believes the number of discouraged male workers is underreported . " There ' s a sociological difference between women and men that makes it easier for women to admit the truth , that they are not actively looking for work , " the economist said . " Men are less likely to say they have slacked off in their efforts to find a job . They represent themselves as looking for work because that ' s what men are supposed to do . " The economist also believes the number of female unemployed is underreported . " The statistics come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor , in which people come to your door and ask you questions , " she said . " In this case , the question is : ' Do you have a job or are you looking for a job ? ' They don ' t really ask you if you want a job . They don ' t ask if you would accept a job as good as your last job , one that also pays as well . " The result , Bergmann said , is that " you don ' t get counted as unemployed unless you have looked for a job in the previous week . Instead , you are described as a ' discouraged ' worker . " The way the question is asked , the economist said , " hides an important problem , namely high unemployment . " The bottom line , Bergmann said , is that " we really ought to have a reform of the way we measure unemployment , especially the category of people who are discouraged from looking but who would want a job if they could get one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among women and men , she says . " If the questions were adequately revised , they would show that women suffer more from unemployment than men do , " the economist said . Inaccurate statistics do additional damage . " The reason we have unemployment numbers at all is to show where the economy is deficient in providing what ' s needed , " Bergmann said . " If they show women aren ' t looking , you don ' t have to do anything for them . " Actually , women ' s need for jobs is getting more crucial , not less . More and more women are supporting themselves and their families . " And that ' s why , the economist said , " the true numbers of unemployed women and their inability to get jobs are increasingly vital to know . " The statistics may be skewed , but they do suggest the scope of the problem that women , especially the nation ' s 10 million women who head families , have in finding good-paying jobs . Bergmann ' s solutions for unemployed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women , paying salaries sufficient to support a family , raising the minimum wage , expanding openings in the military for women and enforcing affirmative action . As she notes in her book , the problem of the numbers of women who are unemployed or discouraged workers won ' t go away . " Women are in the labor market to stay , " Bergmann said . " It ' s an economic phenomenon that won ' t reverse itself . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Economist Barbara R. Bergmann says the " discouraged workers " are " in a way . . . the saddest of the unemployed .
