It all happened in a single year , just a half-century ago . The dark days seemed to have ended at last  --  the years of the Depression and the dust bowl  --  and Americans were regaining their pride and self-confidence . They had touched bottom , but they had pulled themselves up . As the ' 30s ended , the New York World 's Fair summed up the nation 's suddenly buoyant mood with its official march , Dawn of a New Day . And who , in the atmosphere of optimism that marked the start of 1939 , could have doubted that it was so ? <P> Certainly not Hollywood , which was beginning the greatest year of its Golden Age . In fact , it was to be the most memorable twelve months in the history of the American cinema . There was Gone With the Wind , of course , whose production attracted more intense public curiosity than any other film ever made . When Vivien Leigh  --  beautiful , talented , but indisputably English  --  was cast in the role of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with patriotic fury , as if the Redcoats had burned Washington again . " Why not cast Chiang Kai-shek and change the part to Gerald O'Hara ? " a correspondent indignantly demanded of Movie Mirror , one of the era 's many fan magazines . <P> But Gone With the Wind was just one in the astonishing list of movies released in 1939 . There was also The Wizard of Oz , the grandest and most glorious of all fantasies , and Stagecoach , the model for all westerns to come . There was the dark , gothic romance of Wuthering Heights ; adventure stories like Gunga Din , Beau Geste and Drums Along the Mohawk ; sophisticated comedies like Ninotchka , The Women and Idiot 's Delight . <P> Historical dramas ? Of course . In 1939 there was something for everyone . Try Juarez , Union Pacific and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell . Tearjerkers ? Take a box of Kleenex and see Dark Victory , Intermezzo , Goodbye , Mr. Chips and The Light That Failed . Politics ? Just think of Frank Capra 's populist parable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mice and Men . The list goes on and on : Babes in Arms ; Destry Rides Again ; The Hunchback of Notre Dame ; W.C. Fields ' You Ca n't Cheat an Honest Man ; The Roaring Twenties ; and The Cat and the Canary , which gave Bob Hope his first starring role . <P> In those days of studio czars and long-term contracts , there was no time to watch the waves in Malibu while waiting for inspiration , the right script or more money . Everyone worked in the fantasy factories of 1939 , and nearly every major figure was represented by at least one picture . Jimmy Stewart 's fans , for example , had no fewer than five to choose from ( Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , Destry Rides Again , Made for Each Other , It 's a Wonderful World and Ice Follies of 1939 ) , and so did Henry Fonda enthusiasts ( Jesse James , Young Mr. Lincoln , Drums Along the Mohawk , Let Us Live and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell ) .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
