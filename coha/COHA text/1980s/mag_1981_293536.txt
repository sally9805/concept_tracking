THE RECRUITING OFFICER by George Farquhar <P> Restoration comedy is famous for its bawdry , but its bounty can be a trifle daunting . It would take a whiz in algebra to resolve all the plot equations in The Recruiting Officer , this season 's second repertory offering at the Brooklyn Academy of Music . The production reveals grand ambitions and a dearth of acting skills - champagne tastes on a beer income . <P> It is wisest to focus on the two romantic couples in the action . If the course of true love never does run smooth , it traverses some pretty funny country . The play , dating from 1706 , takes place in the sleepy village of Shrewsbury . Captain Plume ( Brian Murray ) , a recruiting officer , has come to the place to rook and hook the local lads into military service . <P> A rake of renown , Plume stirs the love of Silvia ( Laurie Kennedy ) , who disguises herself in male uniform and eventually hooks him . Plume 's best friend , Mr. Worthy ( Frank Maraden ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heiress named Melinda , played in an impish comic vein by Laura Esterman . Bumpkins , worldlings , gulls and wits populate the evening . Toward the end of the play , it becomes evident that Plume is not a womanizing gourmand , as he pretends to the world , but a moonstruck child of sentiment who has found in the chaste but frolicsome Silvia his true heart 's love . - T.E.K.
