BEYOND THERAPY by Christopher Durang <P> Back in the ' 20s , when the subject was new , everybody enjoyed a good joke about analysis , and even Sigmund Freud was heard to repeat a popular limerick : <P> A progressive young lady of Rheims <P> Had confessed some astonishing dreams <P> And was justly annoyed <P> When the great Doctor Freud <P> Said : " A surfeit of chocolate creams . " <P> The jokes have never stopped , but rarely have they been so funny as they are in Christopher Durang 's newest comedy , which opened on Broadway last week . Screwball and scatty , with as much owed to the Marx brothers as to the Viennese brethren , Beyond Therapy offers the best therapy of all : guaranteed laughter . <P> Bruce is a lawyer who has put an ad in a sex paper for a female companion . Prudence is a writer from PEOPLE magazine who has answered it , and the two meet for dinner . It is hate at first bite , and next morning the two retreat to their analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious . Despite some astonishing dreams , Prudence ( Dianne Wiest ) is all prudence , afraid of saying yes , no or maybe , while Bruce ( John Lithgow ) is bisexual . He wants to get married and move to the suburbs-where his lover Bob would live above the garage . <P> Durang 's analysts are not much help . In fact , they seem to be more in need of assistance than their patients . Her analyst ( Peter Michael Goetz ) bitterly complains that none of his patients talk . His analyst ( Kate McGregor-Stewart ) belongs to the I'm-O.K. , you're-O.K. school , which tells the kooks that they are fine-everyone else is crazy . " When you were mad at me , you pulled out your toy gun and shot me , " she tells Bob ( Jack Gilpin ) . " That 's the beginning of mental health . " <P> Boy , of course , meets girl again-and boy too-as Durang 's plot , which has more odd bounces than a pinball game , goes from the unexpected to the unpredicted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily jolts it with another that is neither common or in place , providing two hours of hilarious surprises . He has a fine ensemble cast trying on his Freudian slips . Lithgow and Wiest are both funny and touching as the couch-crossed lovers , while Goetz and McGregor-Stewart , who could not shrink a wool sock , provide more than a few expansive belly laughs . Director John Madden is wise enough to know that the humor is not only in the words , but in the pauses between . - By Gerald Clarke
