A baseball season with the potential of a Canadian sunset <P> Fair territory in baseball , as defined by the foul lines , extends in theory to infinity , but whoever thought it reached Saskatoon ? For half a season , Montreal and Toronto have been leading half the divisions in the major leagues , and now a Canadian World Series is more than just a chilling thought . It 's a possibility , God save the Queen . <P> At last week 's All-Star game , the northern influence was evident from the first sentimental bars of O Canada . The National League lineup was top-heavy with the bright particular talents of the Montreal Expos : the admirable catcher Gary Carter , the ageless hitter Al Oliver , the young speedster Tim Raines , and the man a New York Times poll has found to be the most respected player in the game today , Centerfielder Andre Dawson . Since Willie Mays left , baseball has had a soft spot for centerfielders with all-round gifts . Dawson won the Gold Glove at his position the past three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hitting or home runs or runs batted in , almost everyone thinks he should . <P> On the American League side , right-handed Pitcher Dave Stieb was the only All-Star from the Toronto Blue Jays , but he started the game and won it . Back when Toronto was a last-place team , just last year as a matter of fact , Stieb was good enough to pitch five shutouts and win 17 games . Now his record is 10-7 with an earned run average of 2.54 , but it is misleading to consider him the Blue Jays ' only star . Jim Clancy and Luis Leal have been formidable pitchers , and the able hitters include First Baseman Willie Upshaw , Outfielder Lloyd Moseby and Cliff Johnson , the old designated hitter , whose varied sojourns included a memorable pause with the New York Yankees . <P> In a clubhouse scuffle , Johnson wrecked Reliever Goose Gossage for 13 weeks in 1979 . Mindful that the Yankees represent their primary opposition ( along with the Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers ) , the Blue Jays have loaded up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed Yankee contract ( $400,000 this year , $500,000 next year , $850,000 the year after that ) by just $22,500 in the delicious hope that releasing Alexander will turn out to be a more expensive mistake for New York than signing him . <P> The Blue Jays are bubbling , but the Expos , division champs in 1981 and on the verge of a pennant for years , are less taken with the standings . " We have n't sparkled , " says Oliver , the defending batting champion . " We 've been lucky that the rest of the division Philadelphia , St. Louis , et al. ) has been pretty lousy too . " Emotionally , neither team reflects its customers . As Stieb says , " Montreal has a lot of French Canadians , hot-blooded and spirited types . Toronto fans are English Americans , a bit more staid . " However , he has noticed increased fan enthusiasm in Toronto since the team began winning and started selling beer .                 @ @ @ @
