With a little champagne in the Rose Garden and a good deal of sentiment from Ronald Reagan , the White House troika marched into the history books last week to become another chapter in the arcane world of staffing and running the presidency . Meese , Baker , Deaver , sounding  --  and often acting  --  like an infield in the American League , now will be part of the lore that includes Nicolay and Hay , who served Lincoln , Colonel House , who advised Wilson , Kennedy 's Irish Mafia and the infamous Berlin Wall , Haldeman and Ehrlichman , Nixon 's unfortunate duo who ended up in jail . <P> For four years Jim Baker , Mike Deaver and Ed Meese were the powers within the power , and they were about as good as you can be at that strange business . There have been stories , of course , about occasional stress backstage , and there may be some new revelations as the books and reminiscences roll out . But it will be hard to dim the luster of these four years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and successfully support a President . <P> The Rose Garden affair was a private salute to Deaver , who went off into his own public relations business , the last of the three to find new work . Baker , the Secretary of the Treasury , ribbed him about being an expert " leak " and brought appreciative snorts by invoking the standard White House parry to outsiders : " And remember , Mike , do n't call us , we 'll call you . " Deaver , in reply , pronounced Baker 's words " the best speech " that Margaret Tutwiler , Baker 's assistant , ever wrote . <P> The President promised not to raise " golf balls " in anybody 's throat , but did . Nancy cast her eyes down . Meese , the new Attorney General , beamed at everybody . White House switchboard operators , advancemen and journalists , all acknowledging some admiration of the troika era , nibbled shrimps and watched the shadows along the White House lengthen and history move on . <P> How did the troika do it ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power arbiters , Henry Kissinger , predicted that such a division of authority around the President might not work . It did , and now many of the same people are predicting that power will be too centralized under the new chief , Don Regan . Washington is slow to learn . <P> It is simply not possible to define or chart what those three men did for Reagan or how they did it . " It 's a people business , " explains Baker , adding as much mystery as he dispels . If he ever writes a book about what went on in those four years , it will be more of a psychology text than a manual on technique . <P> " It was the loyalty to the President that made the thing go , " says Meese , a thought that all three endorse . They loved the man , to put it in its purest terms . They would do almost anything to help him , and almost anything to avoid embarrassing him . Reagan did not want strife in this staff , so the troika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they did on anything .
