AUGUSTA , Ga . - A year ago Craig Stadler arrived at the Masters as a chubby , temperamental longshot , apparently destined to be mainly the butt of newspaper gags . Stadler ' s nickname , The Walrus , evolves from his hefty silhouette and droopy moustache . The fact that his golf bag advertised Taylor ' s Steak House added impetus to the humor about the 26-year-old Californian . " Members of Stadler ' s gallery should be called The Weight Watchers , " wrote Atlanta ' s Furman Bisher . " He moves down the fairway like a moose stalking his dinner . " It was noted by this typist that Stadler , at the time , seemed out of place at Augusta . " Craig would look more appropriate with a group of Gerela ' s Gorillas riding a bus to Three Rivers Stadium , " it was suggested . " I ' ve been called everything from the bartender to the bouncer , " chuckled Stadler this week . " Doesn ' t bother me anymore . They don ' t post your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who estimated his playing weight at 215 pounds to a skeptical audience at Greensboro last week , can afford to be more casual about his bulk . He ' s now the second-leading money winner on the tour ( $117,611 already in 1980 ) and the writers are taking more questions about his golf than his size . " The key difference in my game is confidence . Winning the Hope Classic ( in January ) and Greensboro ( last week ) has changed my attitude . I was beginning to wonder last year if I ever would win a decent event on the tour , " said Stadler . The only tourney Craig had won in three years on tour before this was the 1978 Magnolia , a satellite played on Masters week . That was what gained Stadler his invitation here a year ago when he made his surprising debut . For two days at Augusta last year Craig looked like Jack Nicklaus in mint condition . He shot 69 and 66 and was co-leader after 36 holes at 9-under-par 135 . The fact that he fell off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discourage Stadler . " I made a few stupid shots , sprayed drives , poor club selection , " he explained this week . " But it wasn ' t a shattering experience . I just got a little greedy and the course ate me up . " I came in here last year , my first visit to Augusta as a pro , really looking forward to the tourney . I thought I could play the course well , that it suited my game , and I proved that to myself with those first two rounds . " The difference this year is that I can drive up Magnolia Lane bubbling over with confidence . I had been in contention many times in past tourneys . But until the Hope , I never had been close at the end . " Many of his fellow pros chalk up Stadler ' s improvement to maturity as much as to confidence . The native of San Diego always has possessed the talent . His golfing history includes a National Amateur title back in 1973 , All-America status at Southern Cal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 75 . But Craig also was noted for some juvenile temper tantrums . He wouldn ' t get upset with his competitors or gallery , just himself . His one or two high rounds in each tourney could be attributed to brooding over a bad shot or hole , then losing his concentration . He admitted this problem here a year ago but he seems to have calmed down at the age of 26 and in the state of matrimony . Now Craig Stadler can coolly concentrate on each shot for the full 72 holes . " That is one of the vital factors in playing championship golf , " said Lee Trevino this week . " And the problem is that you tend to lose it as you get older . As you lose your stamina , you lose your concentration , the major advantage the younger guys ( like Stadler ) possess . " How about an example , Lee ? " Well , when I was younger , I used to hit 400 , 500 balls a day and concentrate on every one . " Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen balls , they begin to get blurry . The ball starts looking back at me , " said Trevino . Stadler ' s confidence , established by finally finding his winning touch , is bolstered by the fact he played so well at Greensboro last week . He led the tourney at the 36- and 54-hole pitstops and calmly birdied the first two holes on Sunday . " After that it was a walk in the park , " he said about the six- stroke victory , largest margin on this tour this year . Another Stadler asset this week is how well the Augusta National suits his golf game . Craig may look like a blacksmith walking up to these huge , fast greens but he has the touch of a locksmith in his short game . The fairways here are very wide and there is no rough - perfect conditions for a driver like Stadler . He ranks 18th among the PGA tourists in driving distance with anaverage of 261.4 yards off the tee , but is only 135th in driving accuracy , hitting his tee ball into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter at his Lake Tahoe , Nev. , home Stadler grew a luxuriant , reddish-hued beard . " I was up there with my wife Sue , chopping wood and skiing , and I just let it grow , " he explained . He was wearing that beard when he won the Hope Desert Classic in January but he shaved it off last week in Greensboro . " We ' ve had other bearded players on the tour , several in the last five years , " said PGA spokesman Tom Place . " But Craig Stadler does have one distinction . He is the first person in PGA history to win one tourney with a beard and another without it in the same year . "
