Texas Gemmologist Roy Whetstine discovered the egg-size violet-and-blue rock in a Tupperware bin at an annual gem-and-mineral bazaar in Tucson last February . The amateur who had found the stone wanted $15 for it but readily sold it to the Texan for $10 . Said Whetstine : " I was used to handling rocks and saying ' Yeah , that 's a keeper ' or ' That 's no good . ' " This one was a keeper . <P> After months of appraisal , Whetstine last week went public with his treasure : a 1,905-carat star sapphire with an estimated uncut value of $2.28 million . Said he : " I 'm astounded that this one pebble out of God 's universe will take care of my children 's lives . That makes me feel very good . " But somewhere a rock hound is crying .
