Passers-by were pressing their noses against the glass , as usual . Almost everybody who walks down Fifth Avenue , it seems , is curious about the men ' s clothing store at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street with the tiny gold sign that says , " By Appointment Only. " // Inside the locked front door , the white-gloved doorman , Victor Stabler , stood guard . His mission : To ward off what the owner , Bijan Pakzad , calls " untasty people . " Such people , he believes , do not have the taste or the money for suits that cost about $2 , 000 or shirts that are $400 or ties that sell for $150 . Nor would they probably have any interest in a $120 , 000 chinchilla bedspread. // Bijan himself is nowhere in sight . He is " with a prime minister , " one of his employees says . The store , which many regard as the most exclusive in Manhattan , looks deserted . Such is the case when you have only five or six customers a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25 , 000 a visit , he said. // This store and another on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills have brought fame and fortune to Bijan , a 45-year-old Iranian immigrant who uses only his first name professionally . His 15 , 000 customers , he said , include 4 kings and 16 presidents . Among his customers are President Reagan , Cary Grant , Walter H. Annenberg , King Juan Carlos of Spain , Frank Sinatra , Jack Nicholson , Henry A. Kissinger , King Hussein of Jordan , Stevie Wonder , Adnan Khashoggi and the Rev. Jesse Jackson . They have spent , he said , $150 million in his two stores since he went into business in Beverly Hills in 1973 . He opened the New York store two years ago . Some of that money went for items that helped to give Bijan a flamboyant reputation : a $10 , 000 gold inlaid . 38-caliber pistol , a line of bulletproof clothing and a men ' s perfume that costs $1 , 500 for six ounces. // " Sorry I am late , " the intense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to finish my hour with the prime minister . " He would not reveal the prime minister ' s identity except to say that he is from a country " very close to the United States . " <> <> ' A Doctor to My Clients ' // " I don ' t want to sound snobby , " he said , " but even if he didn ' t care if I gave you his name , I would care . I am a doctor to my clients , if I do not sound snobby . I know how they feel , I know what color is right for them , I know how they should dress . I don ' t want to take advantage of them in the news media . " But he did say the prime minister spent $20 , 000. // Bijan said he had canceled his two other appointments that afternoon to protect his clients ' privacy while a reporter was in the store . Nevertheless , he keeps framed photographs of some clients in his customer lounge and he has a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best clients . They are set to the local time of each client ' s hometown. // " Those clients that do not have their names on clocks , " he said , grinning , " they are a bit envious. " // Bijan , who is 5 feet 7 inches tall , exudes a kind of frantic affability in conversation , and he accompanies his words with dramatic gestures . He was wearing a black cashmere suit , a black tie and a black-and-white striped silk shirt . The clothes , like all of those sold in his store , were designed by Bijan . He said he makes only a few copies of each garment. // " I think simplicity and honesty are the two words that best describe my line of clothing , " he said . " I work from A to Z. I design the fabric , I design the clothing , I have the clothing made in my factory in Italy . Then when a customer comes in , I study the man . If he ' s a judge , for example , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictate , in a conservative way , how I feel my clients should dress. " // What happens if a client disagrees with his assessment ? Bijan frowns . " Sometimes , " he says , " a client ' s girlfriend or mistress might decide she does not like what I ' m introducing . In that case , I say , ' Excuse me , ' and then take the man to the door . I shake his hand and say , ' Goodbye. ' " // Bijan does business in luxurious , $10 million surroundings that include a Baccarat crystal chandelier , a double brass and glass stairway , a 17th century Flemish tapestry , antique furniture and many Persian rugs. // New York , Bijan says , has been good to him . " I do twice as much business here as I do in Beverly Hills , " he said . " I love New York . New York is a town where a man can be very well dressed . New York is a town where if you show quality , people will go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what might be called house calls , usually to Europe or the Middle East , to see customers who find it inconvenient to visit his stores. // " I recently visited a businessman in Europe who spent half a million dollars in an hour and a half , " he said , beaming . " This man is powerful and very , very smart . And two months ago I made a trip to England , where I saw a member of the royal family , and did over 100 , 000 pounds while I was there . " <> <> ' I Have Connections ' // He lights a cigarette , takes a deep puff and says : " Please , I do not want to sound snobby , but I have power , I have connections with all those people , I have homes all over the world , all you want for a 45-year-old man . I am a multimillionaire myself. " // The telephone rings . It is a woman from Geneva calling to say that the $34 , 000 topcoat with the chinchilla lining that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 monogrammed shirts for her husband . " That ' s $36 , 000 , " Bijan said , looking pleased as he hung up. // Bijan Pakzad was born April 4 , 1940 , in Teheran , Iran , to a well-to-do family in the steel business . His parents wanted him to be an electrical engineer , but he chose fashion , studying in Switzerland and Italy . He moved to the United States 15 years ago and became a citizen 3 years later . He has one child , Daniela , 24 , from a marriage that ended in divorce . She works in his Beverly Hills store . <> <> His Homes and Cars // Bijan owns a penthouse in New York City , an estate in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles , and a villa in Florence . His fleet of cars , he said , includes two Rolls-Royces , a Ferrari , an Aston Martin , two Mercedes-Benzes and a Cadillac . Romantically , he is involved with Tracy Hayakawa , a model who appears in some of his advertisements , including one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You chauvinist ! " And Bijan has appeared in controversial advertisements with nuns and rabbis who appear to be enjoying the " heavenly scent " of his perfume. // Bijan ' s plans include opening a store in London and introducing a $40-to-$120 version of his men ' s perfume for sale in department stores . As for women ' s clothes , he said he has " no interest - I have so much to do for men , why should I go to women ? " // American men especially need his help , Bijan says . " This country ' s men desperately need somebody to teach them simplicity and color combination , " he said . " Too many of them wear polyester pants that are too short and wash-and-wear shirts . I do believe that for every man , clothes are the key to success - from the President to my doorman. " //
