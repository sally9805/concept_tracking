txt ELAFIELD , Wis. ? In the city where I live , there are four million people . When I woke up on a Saturday morning , much of the news of those people was unhappy . In the criminal courts building , a man was on trial for , allegedly murdering 33 boys and young men , the most killings charged to one person in United States histbry . The city 's school teachers were fighting with the Board of Education ; children had not been to classes in two weeks . The firefighters were angry , too ; they talked of walking out on their jobs . An arson-for-profit ring was being investigated , in which human lives were traded for insurance dollars . The choice i had was the choice a newspaper reporter makes every day : which of those big-city crises to think about before the end of the shift , and the deadline for the next column . But on this Saturday , I chose none . Instead I borrowed a ride just two hours to the north , and here I sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below freezing . I am in the living room of a house where I have never been . Out the window , Lake Nagawicka is frozen solid . There is a small island out in the middle of the lake . In the summer , the townspeople approach it by boat . This afternoon , though , children are walking out over the frozen surface of the lake , their black rubber boots flopping against their ankles , heading for that island on foot . ON A MAP , I am not far from the big city in which I make my living ; indeed , the sounds of the big city 's radio stations stayed clear most of the way up here . It was only in the last 20 minutes or so of the ride that the city voices disappeared , and were replaced by the voices of the smaller Wisconsin broadcast outlets . It is quiet here . I feel like an intruder ; I am a stranger in the house , and as I walk around the first floor I realize that this place has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . If I were to talk about the important news stories of the city , the people here would be puzzled. , as well they should . Up here , those stories seem to have no true importance , no relation to life as real people live it . I look at the framed photographs on the wall of Ibis house . Generations of a family I know nothing about , the faces smiling proudly for photographers If I were to talk about the important news stories of the city , the people here would be puzzled , as well they should . Up here , those stories seem to have no true importance . going back to almost a century ago . The history in this house has nothing to do with stories that once appeared on the front pages of newspapers ; the history here is a personal history , and walking in the midst of it I sense a significance that could never be matched by news stories that appear one Monday and are forgotten two weeks hence . AROUND THE EDGE of the lake , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ice . The Leprechaun , the Light House ; to a visitor they look the same , but each has its own clientele , its own personality . There are pool tables , and racks of potato chips and pretzels for sale . The faces , it is easy to sense , are here every Saturday afternoon . Some of the people of Delafield talk over their beer ; some play a hand of cards . A few read the region 's daily paper , the Waukesha Freeman . There are wire service stories about the White House and the Kremlin and the FBI , but those are not the ones that have caught the fancy of this afternoon 's readers . Instead , the men and women in the Leprechaun read that Waukesha North High School lost in overtime , 61-55 , to West Allis Hale last night . This was not the only important basketball game up . here ; West Bend East beat Oconomowoc , 67-65 , and Kettle Moraine defeated Slinger , 59-56 . AND THERE IS other news . Anne Dennis , daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be married to Richard Jonas , son of Mr. and Mrs. William Jonas of Pewaukee . The prospective bridegroom works at the Quality Aluminum Casting Co. ; the wedding will be on July 26 at St. Mary Catholic Church . Ruth Heinzen of Waukesha has been named the No. 1 Sales Associate of the year by Relocation Realty . James Burmeister will present an organ recital at the North Shore Presbyterian Church in Shorewood . The town 's Choral Union will hold auditions in Carroll College 's Shattuck Auditorium ; the auditions are open to any interested singer . Surely there is heartache and crime and unhappiness here in Delafield ; this is 1980 , and the plagues of the real world can not be kept at bay , not anywhere . But from where I sit on a freezing afternoon , all is quiet . I watch those children tromping out toward the island , over the ice ; one pulls a sled behind him . It is silent here in the house ; only the sound of the dog pacing around on the wooden floor upstairs pro- vides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those children will return from the island . Their parents will be waiting . It will be time to go to dinner at Karl and Gretchen 's , the restaurant which has served the families of Delafield on Saturday nights for generations . Dusk ; time for me to return , also . In a few hours I will be back in the city of deadlines and crises and news that never stops . For now , though , the only news that matters is right out that window , over the frozen lake . It is news of another kind ; news that there is more than one way to live a life . That is today 's news from Delafield , ChIcago Tribune ProsiService
