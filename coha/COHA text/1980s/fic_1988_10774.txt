remembering the sequence of numbers to reach Masqat , he dialed O for an operator . Suddenly the dial tone disappeared and for a moment he panicked , his eyes wide , glancing around at the windows . " Yeah , twenty-three ? " came the hoarse male voice over the line . " I was trying to call the operator . " " You dial even an area code you get the board here . " " I . . . I have to make an overseas call , " stammered Evan , bewildered . " Not on this phone you do n't . " " On a credit card . How do I get an operator  --  I 'm charging it to my credit card number . " " I 'll listen in till I hear you give the number and it 's accepted for real , understand ? " He did not understand ! Was it a trap ? Had he been traced to a run-down motel in Woodbridge , Virginia ? " I do n't really think that 's acceptable , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fancy that , " replied the voice derisively . " Then go find yourself a pay phone . There 's one at the diner about five miles down the road . Ta-ta , asshole , I 've been stuck enough  --  " " Wait a minute ! All right , stay on the line . But when the operator clears it , I want to hear you click off , okay ? " " Well , actually , I was gon na call Louella Parsons . " " Who ? " " Forget it , asshole . I 'm dialing . People who stay all day are either sex freaks or shooting up . " Somewhere in the far reaches of the Persian Gulf an English-speaking , Arabic-accented operator volunteered that there was no exchange in Masqat , Oman , with the prefix 555 . " Dial it , please ! " insisted Evan , adding a more plaintive " Please . " Eight rings passed until he heard Ahmat 's harried voice . " Iwah ?

" " I never did that , I never said it ! " " Your world did ! The way it keeps saying it again and again and again , until it 's pretty fucking obvious you want us all in chains ! And the latest goddamned scenario is yours ! " " No ! " protested Kendrick , shouting . " Not mine ! " " Read your press . Watch it ! " " That 's the press , not you and me !

" By them ' I assume you mean like a kid from one of those thousands upon thousands of families marched under guns into camps fit for pigs . For pigs , not families ! Not for mothers and fathers and children ! ... Good gracious , Mr. all-knowing , eminently fair American . If I sound like one of them , gosh , I 'm sorry ! And I 'll tell you what else I 'm sorry about : I got here so late . I understand so much more today than I did yesterday . " " What the hell does that mean . " " I repeat .

" Those Israelis saved my life ! " " You 're damned right they did , but you were incidental ! You were just a bridge to what they really flew in here for . "  | " What are you talking about ? " " I might as well tell you because no one else will , nobody 's going to print that . They did n't give a shit about you , Mr. Hero . That unit came here to get one man out of the embassy , a Mossad agent , a high-ranking strategist posing as a naturalized American under contract to the State Department . " " Oh , my God , " whispered Evan . " Did Weingrass know ? " " If he did he kept his mouth shut . He forced them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved your life . It was n't planned .

Who are these intelligence agents of yours running around my country ? Who are all those contacts you reached ? " " Mustapha , for one ! " " Killed .

An American-Israeli cover-up ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , stop it ! I did n't know anything about a Mossad agent at the embassy until you just told me . If I did I would have told you ! And while we 're at it , my sudden young fanatic , I had nothing to do with the refugee camps or marching families into them under guns  --  " " You all did ! " shouted the sultan of Oman . " One genocide for another , but we had nothing to do with the other ! Out ! " The line went dead . A good man and a good friend who had been instrumental in saving his life was gone from his life . As were his plans to return to a part of the world he dearly loved . Before he showed himself in public , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen and why ! I lc had to start somewhere andp303that somewhere was the State Department and a man named Frank Swann . A frontal assault on State was , of course , out of the question . The minute he identified himself alarms would go off , and insofar as his face was seen repeatedly , ad nauseam , on television and half of Washington was searching for him , his every move had to be carefully thought out . First things first : how to reach Swann without Swann or his office knowing it . His office ? Evan remembered . A year ago he had walked into Swann 's office and spoken to a secretary , giving her several words in Arabic so as to convey the urgency of his visit . She had disappeared into another office and ten minutes later he and Swann were talking in the underground computer complex . That secretary was not only efficient but also exceedinglyprotective , as apparently were most secretaries in serpentine Washington . And since that protective secretary was very much aware of one Congressman Kendrick , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be receptive to another voice also protective of her boss . It was worth a try ; it was also the only thing he could think of . He picked up the phone , dialed the 202 area code for Washington , and waited for the hoarse manager of the Three Bears motel to come on the line . " Consular Operations , Director Swann 's office , " said the secretary . " Hi , this is Ralph over in ID , " began Kendrick . " I 've got some news for Frank . " " Who 's this ? " " It 's okay , I 'm a friend of Frank 's . I just want to tell him that there may be an interdivision meeting called for later this afternoon  --  " " Another one ? He does n't need that . " " How 's his schedule ? " " Overworked ! He 's in conference until four o'clock . " " Well , if he does n't want to be put on the grill again , maybe he should have a short day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll parachute into the jungles of Nicaragua , but he wo n't take chances in Washington traffic . " " You know what I mean . Things are a little jumpy around here . He could be put on the spit . " " He 's been on it since six this morning . " " Just trying to help out a buddy . " " Actually , he 's got a doctor 's appointment , " said the secretary suddenly . " Ile does ? " " Ile does now . Thanks , Ralph . "  | " I never called you . " " Of course not , sweetie . Someone in ID was just checking schedules . " Evan stood in the crowd waiting for a bus at the corner of Twenty-first Street within clear sight of the entrance to the Department of State . After speaking to Swann 's secretary , he had left the cabin and driven rapidly up to Washington , stopping briefly at a shopping mall in Alexandria where he bought dark glasses , a wide-brimmed canvas fishing hat and a soft cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secretary had pursued her protective inclinations , Frank Swann , deputy director of Consular Operations , would be coming out of the huge glass doors within the next fifteen or twenty minutes . He did . At 4:03 and in a hurry , turning left on the pavement away from the bus stop . Kendrick rushed out of the crowd and started after the man from the State Department , staying thirty feet behind him , wondering what means of transportation the nondriving Swann would take . If he intended to walk , Kendrick would stop him in front of a vest-pocket park , or someplace else where they could talk undisturbed . He was not going to walk ; he was about to take a bus heading east on Virginia Avenue . Swann joined several others waiting for the same vehicle now lumbering down the street toward the stop . Evan hurried to the corner ; he could not allow the Cons Op director to get on that bus . He approached Swann and touched his shoulder . " Hello , Frank , " said Kendrickpleasantly , taking off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished Swann , startling the other passengers as the doors of the bus cracked open. " lt ' 7e , " admitted Evan quietly . " I think we 'd better talk . " " Good Christ ! You 've got to be out of your mind ! " " If I am , you 've driven me there , even if you do n't drive  --  " It was as far as their brief conversation got , for suddenly an odd voice filled the street , echoing off the side of the bus . " It 's him ! " roared a strange-looking , disheveled man with wide , popping eyes and long , wild hair that fell over his ears and his forehead . " See ! Look ! It 's him ! CommandoKendrick ! I seen him all day long on the television  --  I got seven televisions in my apartment ! Nothin ' goes on I do n't know about ! It 's him ! " Before Evan could react the man grabbed the fishing hat off his head . " Hey ! " shouted Kendrick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get out of here ! " cried Swann.  |p305They  started running up the street , the odd-looking man in pursuit , his baggy trousers flopping in the wind he created , Evan 's hat in his hand , his arms flailing . " He 's following us ! " said the Cons Op director , looking back . " He 's got my hat ! " said Kendrick . Two blocks later , a doddering blue-haired lady with a cane was climbing out of a cab . " There ! " yelled Swann . " The taxi ! " Dodging traffic , they raced across the wide avenue . Evan climbed in the near door as the man from the State Department ran around the trunk to the far side ; he helped the elderly passenger out and inadvertently kicked the cane with his foot . It fell to the pavement ; so did the blue-haired lady . " Sorry , dear , " said Swann , jumping into the backseat . " Let 's go ! " yelled Kendrick . " Hurry up ! Get out of here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , " said the driver , shifting into gear . " You 'll be richer for it if you 'll just hurry , " added Evan . " I 'm hurryin ' , I 'm hurryin ' . I ai n't got no pilot 's license . I got ta stay earthbound , y'know what I mean ? " As one , Kendrick and Swann whipped around to look out the rear window . Back at the corner the odd-looking man with the wild hair and baggy trousers was writing something down on a newspaper , Evan 's hat now on his head . " The name of the company and the cab 's number , " said the Cons Op director quietly . " Wherever we 're going , we 'll have to switch vehicles at least a block behind this one . " " Why ? Not the switch but the block away ? " " So our driver does n't see which cab we get into . " " You even sound like you know what you 're doing . " " I hope you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiping his sweat-drenched face . Twenty-eight minutes and a second taxi later , the Congressman and the man from the Department of State walked rapidly down the street in a run-down section of Washington . They looked up at a red neon sign with three letters missing . It was a seedy bar that belonged in its environs . They nodded to each other and walked inside , somewhat startled by the intensely dark interior , if only in contrast to the bright October day out in the street . The single glaring , blaring source of light was a television set bolted into the wall above the shabby distressed bar . Several hunchedover , disheveled , bleary-eyed patrons confirmed the status of the establishment . Both squinting in the receding dim wash of light , Kendrick and Swann moved toward the darker regions to the right of the bar ; they found a frayed booth and slid in opposite each other.  | " You really insist we talk ? " asked the gray-haired Swann , breathing deeply , his face flushed and still perspiring . " I insist to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Watch it , I 'm a black belt . " " In what ? " Swann frowned . " I was never quite sure , but it always works in themovies when they show us doing our thing . I need a drink . " " You signal a waiter , " said Kendrick . " I 'll stay in the shadows . " " Shadows ? " questioned Swann , raising his hand cautiously for a heavyblack waitress with flaming red hair . " Where 's any light in here ? " " When did you last do three push-ups in succession , Mr. Karate Kid ? " " Sometime in the sixties . Early , I think . " " That 's when they replaced the light bulbs in this place .... Now about me . How the hell could you , you liar ? " " How the hell could you think I would ? " cried the man from State , suddenly silent as the grotesque waitress stood by the table , arms akimbo . " What 'll you have ? " he asked Evan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Or healthy , I suspect . Two ryes , double , thank you . Canadian , if you have it . " " Forget it , " said the waitress . " Forgotten , " agreed Swann as the waitress left , his eyes again on Kendrick . " You 're funny , Mr. Congressman , I mean really hilarious . Consular Operations wants my head ! The Secretary of State has put out a directive that makes it clear he does n't know who I am , that vacillating , academic fleabag ! And the Israelis are screaming because they think their precious Mossad may be compromised by anyone digging , and the Arabs on our payroll are bitching because they 're not getting any credit ! And at three-thirty this afternoon the President  --  the goddamned President  --  ischewing me out for dereliction of duty . ' Let me tell you , he intoned that phrase just like he knew what the hell he was talking about , which meant I knew there were at least two other people on the line . ... You 're running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dumb business  --  " " That 's what I called it , " interrupted Evan quickly , quietly . " Sorry . " " You should be , " said Swann without missing a beat . " Because who'sgoing to do this shit except us bastards dumber than the system ? You needus , Charlie , and do n't you forget it . The problem is we do n't have muchto show for it . I mean I do n't have to rush home to make sure the poolin my backyard has been treated for algae because of the heat : ... Maiulfp307because I do n't have a pool , and my wife got the house in the divorce settlement because she was sick and tired of my going out for a loaf of bread and coming back three months later with the dirt of Afghanistan still in my ears ! Oh , no , Mr. Undercover Congressman , I did n't blow the whistle on you . Instead , I did my best to stop the blowing . I have n't got much left , but I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You tried to stop the blowing ? The whistle ? " " Low-key , very offhand , very professional . I even showed him a copy of the memo I sent upstairs rejecting you . " " Him ? " Swann looked forlornly at Kendrick as the waitress brought their drinks and stood there , tapping the tabletop while the man from State reached into his pocket , glanced at the bill and paid it . The woman shrugged at the tip and walked away . " Him ? " repeated Evan . " Go ahead , " said Swann , his voice flat , drinking a large portion of his whisky . " Drive another nail in , what difference does it make ? There 's not that much blood left . " " I assume that means you do n't know who he is . Who him is . " " Oh , I 've got a name and a position and even a first-rate recommenda-tion . " " Well ? " " He does n't exist . " " What ? " " You heard me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frustrated Kendrick . " Well , one of them does , but not the man who came to see me . " Swann finished his first drink . " I do n't believe this  --  " " Neither did Ivy , that 's my secretary . Ivy the terrible . " " What are you talking about ? " asked Kendrick plaintively . " Ivy got a call from Senator Allison 's office , from a guy she used to date a couple of years ago . He 's one of the Senator 's top aides now . He asked her to set up an appointment for a staffer doing some confidential work for Allison , so she did . Well , he turns out to be a blond spook with an accent I placed somewhere in middle Europe , but he 's for real , he had you down cold . If you 've got a scar that only your mother knows about , believe me , he has a close-up of it . " " That 's crazy , " broke in Evan softly . " I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions he asked were loaded with PD  --  " " I beg your pardon ? "  | " Prior data on you . He was giving almost as much as he could get from me . He was so pro I was ready to offer him a Eurc-job on the spot . " " But why me ? " " As I said , I wondered , too . So I asked Ivy to check with Allison 's office . To begin with , why would a laid-back senator have that kind of SS  --  " " What ? " " Not what you think . Super-spook . ' Come to t1-.ink of it , I suppose there 's a connection . " " Will you please stick to the point ! " " Sure , " said Swann , drinking his second whisky . " Ivy calls her old boyfriend , and he does n't know what she 's talking about . He never made any call to her and he never heard of any staffer named  --  whatever his name was . " But she had to know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His voice  --  the small talk , what they said to each other " " Her old beau was thick from Georgia and had laryngitis when he phoned her , that 's what Ivy claimed . But the cracker who really called her knew the places they went  --  even down to a couple of motels in Maryland that Ivy would rather not have her husband know about . " " Christ , it 's an operation . " Kendrick reached over and took Swann 's drink . " Why . " " Why did you just take my whisky ? I do n't have a swimming pool , remember ? Or even a house . " Suddenly the blaring television set above the bar burst forth with the sharply consonated name of " Kendrick ! " Both men snapped their heads over to the source , their eyes wide , unbelieving . " Newsbreak ! The story of the hour , perhaps the decade ! " yelled a TV journalist among a crowd of leering faces peering into the camera . " For the last twelve hours all Washington has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hero of Oman , but to no avail . The worst fears , of course , center around the possibility of Arab retaliation . We 're told the government has directed the police , the hospitals and the morgues to be on the alert . Yet only minutes ago he was seen on this very street corner , specifically identified by one Kasimer Bola  --  Bola . . slawski . Where are you from , sir ? " " Jersey City , " replied the wild-eyed man with Kendrick 's hat on his head , " but my roots are in Warsaw ! God 's holy Warsaw ! " " You were born in Poland , then . " " Not exactly . In Newark . " " But you saw Congressman Kendrick ' "  | " Positively . He was talking to a gray-haired man a couple blocks back outside a bus . Then when I shouted Commando Kendrick , it 's him , ' they started running ! I know ! I got television sets in every room , including the toilet . I never miss anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , sir , you 're actually referring to a corner two and a half streets from the Department of State , are you not ? " " You betcha ! " " We 're certain , " added the sincerely confidential newscaster looking into the camera , " that the authorities are checking State to see if any such person as our witness has described could be a part of this extraordinary rendezvous . " " I chased them ! " yelled the witness in baggy pants , removing Evan 's hat . " I got his hat ! See , it 's the commando 's own hat ! " " But what did you hear , Mr. Bolaslawski ? Back by the bus ? " " I tell you , things are not always what they seem ! You ca n't be too careful . Before they ran away , the man with gray hair gave Commando Kendrick an order . I think he had a Russian accent , maybe Jewish ! The Commies and the Jews  --  you ca n't trust ' em , you know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They do n't know what the Holy Mass isThe television channel abruptly switched to a commercial extolling the virtues of an underarm deodorant . " I surrender , " said Swan , forcibly taking his drink back from Evan and swallowing it whole . " Now I 'm a mole . A Russian Jew from the KGB who does n't know what Mass is . Anything else you want to do for me ? " " No , because I believe you . But you can do something for me , and it 's in both our interests . I 've got to find out who 's doing this to me , who 's done what you 're being blamed for , and why . " " And if you do find out , " interrupted Swann , leaning forward , " you 'll tell me ? That 's in my interest , my only interest right now . I 've got to get off this hook and put someone else on it . " " You 'll be the first to know . " " What do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Masqat . " " That 's not a list , it 's a tight little circle . " Swann shook his head , not so much to be negative as to explain . " There would n't have been that if you had n't said you might need us if it came down to something you could n't handle . I made it clear . We could n't afford to acknowledge you because of the hostages . " " I low tight is the circle ? " " Ii ; verything was verbal , you understand . "  | " Understood . How tight ? " " Nonoperational was restricted to that unmitigated prick , Herbert Dennison , the ball-breaking White House chief of staff , then to the secretaries of State and Defense , and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs . I was the liaison to all four , and you can rule them out . They all had too much to lose and nothing to gain by your surfacing . " Swann leaned back in the booth , frowning . " The operational section was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He was kicking up a fuss about letting you and Weingrass out of his area , thinking the Company had gone nuts and was plowing right into one of those caught-in-the-act situations . Caught-In-the-Act , CIA , get it ? " " I 'd rather not . " " Then there were four or five on-scene Arabs , the best we and the Company have , each of whom studied your photograph but were n't given your identity . They could n't tell what they did n't know . The last two did know who you were ; one was on the scene , the other here at OHIO-FourZerorunning the computers . " " The computers ? " asked Kendrick . " Printouts ? " " You were programmed only on his ; you were zapped from the central unit .

He 'll run Cons Op someday if the girls leave him alone long enough to punch a clock . " " A playboy ? " " Land sakes , Reverend , shall we go to vespers ? The kid 's twenty-six and better-looking than he has a right to be . He 's also unmarried , and one hell of a cocksman  --  others talk about it ; he never does . I think that 's why I like him . There are n't too many gentlemen left in this world . " " I like him already . Who was the last person , the one on the scene who knew me ? " Frank Swann leaned forward , fingering his empty glass , staring at it before raising his eyes to Kendrick . " I thought you might have figured that out for yourself . " " What ? Why ? " " Adrienne Rashad . " " Does n't mean a thing . " " She used a cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Swann nodded . Evan frowned , then *p311suddenly opened his eyes wide , his brows arched . " Khalehla ? " he whispered . The man from the State Department nodded again . " She was one of you ? " " Well , not one of mine , but one of us . " " Christ , she got me out of the airport in Bahrain ! That big son of a bitch MacDonald slammed me into the concourse traffic  --  I was damn near killed and did n't know where I was . She got me out of there  --  how the hell she did it I do n't know ! " " I do , " said Swann . " She threatened to blow the heads off a few Bahrainian police unless they passed her code name up the line and got clearance to take you out . She not only got clearance but also a car from the royal garage . " " You say she was one of us , but not one of you . What does that mean ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouchable . She has contactsall over the Gulf and the Mediterranean ; the CIA does n't allow anyone to mess with her . " " Without her my cover might have been blown at the airport . " " Without her you would have been a target for every terrorist walking around Bahrain , including the Mandi 's soldiers . " Kendrick was briefly silent , his eyes wandering , his lips parted , a memory . " Did she tell you where she hid me ? " " She refused . " " She could do that ? " " I told you , she 's special . " " I see , " said Evan softly . " I think I do , too , " said Swann . " What do you mean by that ? " " Nothing . She got you out of the airport and roughly six hours later made contact . " " Is that unusual ? " " Under the circumstances , you could say it was extraordinary . Her job was to keep you under surveillance and to immediately report any drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was to reach me for instructions . She did n't do that , and in her official debriefing , she omitted any reference to those six hours . " " She had to protect the place where we were hiding . " " Of course . It had to be royal , and nobody screws around with the Emir or his family . " " Of course . " Kendrick again was silent and again he looked into the dark regions of the decrepit bar . " She was a nice person , " he said slowly , hesitantly . " We talked . She understood so many things . I admired her . "  | " Hey , come on , Congressman . " Swann leaned over his empty glass . " You think it 's the first time ? " " What ? " " Two people in a hairy situation , a man and a woman , neither one knowing whether he or she 'll see another day or another week . So they get together , it 's natural . So what ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " " All right , I 'll be blunt . I do n't think you meant anything to her .

" " Area of Operations  --  " " They used that in the newspapers . " " Not my fault . If it was up to me , I 'd neutralize every bastard who wrote those articles . " " Please do n't tell me what neutralize ' means . " " I wo n't . I 'm only telling you that in the field we all slip now and then when we 're exhausted , or just plain scared . We take a few hours of secure pleasure and write it off as a long-overdue bonus . Would you believe we even have lectures on the subject for people we send out ? " " I believe it now . To be honest with you  --  the circumstances crossed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off . She 's strictly Mediterranean and has n't anything to do with the local scene . For starters , you 'd probably have to fly to North Africa to find her . " " So all I 've got is a man named Crawford in Langley and a station chief in Bahrain . " " No . You 've got a blond man with a Middle European accent operating here in Washington . Operating very deep . He got information somewhereand not from me , not from OHIO-Four-Zero . Find him . " Swann gave Evan the standard private numbers at both his office and his apartment and rushed out of the dark , seedy bar as if he needed air . Kendrick ordered a rye from the heavy black waitress with the flaming red hair , and asked her where the pay telephone was , if it existed . She told him . " If you slam it twice on the lower left corner , you 'll get your quarter back . " offered the woman . " If I do , I 'll give it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your friend , " replied the woman . " Crumbs in suits never leave no tips , white or black , makes no difference . " Kendrick got up from the booth and walked cautiously to the ( lark wall '  |p313and  the phone . It was time to call his office . He could not put any more pressure on Mrs. Ann Mulcahy O'Reilly . Squinting , he inserted the coin and dialed . " Congressman Kendrick 's  --  " " It 's me , Annie , " broke in Evan . " My God , where are you ? It 's after five and this place is still a mad-house ! " " That 's why I 'm not there . " " Before I forget ! " cried Mrs. O'Reilly breathlessly . " Manny called a while ago and was very emphatic but not loud  --  which I think means he 's as serious as he can be . " " What did he say ? " " That you 're not to reach him on the Colorado line . " " What ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell that is . " " It 's very clear , Annie .

If Manny was right , a trace could be lasered out and the origin of any incoming call identified in a matter of moments . " I wo n't make any calls to Colorado , " added Evan . " He said to tell you that when things calm down , he 'll drive to Mess Verde and call me here and give me a number where you can reach him . ' " I 'll check back with you .

It 's his private line and lie made sure I understood that less than ten people in Washingtoi had it  --  "  | " I wonder if the President 's one of them , " interrupted Kendrick only half facetiously . " He claimed he is , and in point of fact he said it 's a direct presidential order that you call his chief of staff immediately . " " A direct what ? " " Presidential order . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislativebranch of this government does not take direct orders from the executive , presidential or otherwise .

" " He said they understood why you were keeping out of sight , and that they 'd arrange an unmarked pickup for you wherever you say . . . . Now , may I speak as your elder here in Funny Town , sir ? " " Please . " " You ca n't keep on running , Evan . Sooner or later you 'll have to show up , and it 's better that you know what 's on their minds over there before you do .

"  |p315Herbert  Dennison , White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom and reached for the bottle of Maalox , which he kept in the right-hand corner of the marble counter . In precise sequence , he ingested four swallows of the chalklike liquid , knowing from experience that it would eliminate the hot flashes in his upper chest . Years ago in New York , when the attacks had begun , he had been so frightened that he could barely eat or sleep , so convinced was he that after surviving the hell of Korea he was going to die in the street of cardiac arrest . His then wife  --  the first of three  --  had also been beside herself , unable to decide whether to get him first to a hospital or to their insurance agent for an expanded policy . Without his knowing about it she accomplished the latter , and a week later Herbert bit the bullet and admitted himself to the Cornell Medical Center for a thorough examination . Relief came when the doctors pronounced his heart as strong as a young bull 's , explaining to him that the sporadic fits of discomfort were brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , by stress . From that day forward , in bedrooms , offices , automobiles and briefcases , bottles of the white pacifying liquid were always available to him . Tension was a part of his life . ' I'hc doctors ' diagnosis had been so accurate that over the years he could reasonably predict when , give or take an hour or two , the acid attacksp316would grip him . During his days on Wall Street they invariably came with wild fluctuations in the bond market or when he fought with his peers , who were continually trying to thwart him in his drive for both wealth and position . They were all pukey shits , thought Dennison . Fancy boys from fancy fraternities who belonged to fancy clubs that would n't spit on him , much less consider him for membership . Who gave a nun 's fart ? Those same clubs let in yids and niggers and even spies these days ! All they had to do was speak like fairy actors and buy their clothes from Paul Stuart or from some French faggot . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had the gut instincts of a street fighter in the market and he had cornered so much , made so much that the fucking firm had to make him president or he would have walked out , taking millions with him . And he had shaped up that corporation until it was the sharpest , most aggressivefirm on the Street . He had done so by getting rid of the whining deadwood and that stupid corps of so-called trainees who ate up money and wasted everybody 's time . He had two maxims that became corporate holy writ . The first was : Beat last year 's figures or beat feet out of here . The second was equally succinct : You do n't get trained here , you get here trained . Herb Dennison never gave a damn whether he was liked or disliked ; the theory that the end justified the means suited him splendidly , thank you . He had learned in Korea that soft-nosed officers were often rewarded with GI caskets for their lack of harsh discipline and harsher authority in the field . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where he never dropped his guard against being fragged by a U.S. grenade , and regardless of the losses , he was convinced they would have been far greater had the loosey-goosies been in charge . Like the crybabies on Wall Street : " We want to build trust , Herb , continuity ... " Or : " The youngster of today is the corporate officer of tomorrow  --  a loyal one . " Crap ! You did n't make profits on trust or continuityor loyalty . You made profits by making other people money , that was all the trust and continuity and loyalty they looked for ! And he had been proved right , swelling the client lists until the computers were ready to burst , pirating talent from other firms , making damn sure he got what he paid for or the new boys , too , were out on their asses . Sure , he was tough , perhaps even ruthless , as many called him both to his face and in print , and , yes , he had lost a few good people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the percentages he was right . He had proved it in both military and civilian life . . . and yet in the end , in both , the pukeys had dumped on him . In Korea the regimental CO had damned near promised him the rank of full colonel upon discharge ; it never 0p317happened . In New York  --  Christ , if possible it was worse !  --  his name had been floated around as the newest member of the Board of Directors for Wellington-Midlantic Industries , the most prestigious board in internationalfinance . It never happened . In both cases the old-school-tie fraternitieshad shot him down at the moment of escalation . So he took his millions and said Screw all of you ! Again , he had been right , for he found a man who needed both his money and his considerable talents : a senator from Idaho who had begun ' to raise his startlingly sonorous , impassioned voice , saying things Herb Dennison fervently believed in , yet a politician who could laugh and amuse his growing audiences while at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , with a smile that had not been seen since Eisenhower and Shirley Temple , full of anecdotes and homilies that espoused the old values of strength , courage , self-reliance and , above all  --  for Dennison  --  freedom of choice . Herb had flown down to Washington and a pact was made with that senator . For three years Dennison threw all his energies and several million  --  plus additional millionsfrom numerous anonymous men for whom he had made fortunesuntil they had a war chest that could buy the papacy if it were more obviously on the market . Herb Dennison belched ; the chalky-white liquid pacifier was working , but not rapidly enough ; he had to be ready for the man who would walk into his office in a matter of minutes . He took two more swallows and looked at himself in the mirror , unhappy at the sight of his continuously thinning gray hair that he combed straight back on both sides , the sharply defined part on the left , the top of his head consistent with his nononsenseimage . Peering into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened them as wide as he could ; they were still too narrow . And the slight wattle under his chin reinforced the hint of jowls , remindinghim that he must get some exercise or eat less , neither of which appealed to him . And why , with all the goddamned money he paid for his suits , did n't he look more like the men in the ads his British tailors sent him . Still , there was about him an imposing air of strength , emphasizedby his rigid posture and the thrust of his jaw , both of which he had perfected over the years . He belched again and swallowed another mouthful of his personal elixir . Goddamn Kendrick son of a bitch ! he swore to himself . That nobody-suddenly-somebody was the cause of his anger and discomfort . ... Well , if he were to he honest with himself , and he always tried to be honest with himself , if not always with others , it was not the nobody/ somebody by himself , it was the bastard 's effect on Langford Jennings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vinegar ! What did Langford have in mind ? ( In his thoughts Herb had actually pulled himself short , substituting " the President " for " Langford , " and that made him angrier still ; it was part of the tension , part of the distance that White House authority demanded and Dennison hated it . . . . After the inauguration and three years of calling him by his first name , Jennings had spoken quietly to his chief of staff during one of the inaugural balls , spoken to him in that soft , jocular voice that dripped with self-deprecation and good humor . " You know I do n't give a damn , Herb , but I think the office  --  not me , but the office  --  sort of calls for you to address me as Mr. President , ' do n't you think so , too ? " Damn ! That had been that ! ) What did Jennings have in mind ? Regarding this Kendrick freak , the President had casually agreed with everything Herb had proposed , but the responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bothered the chief of staff . Jennings 's mellifluous voice sounded unconcerned , but his eyes did not convey any lack of concern at all . Every now and then Langford Jennings surprised the whole goddamned bunch of them at the White House . Dennison hoped this was not one of those frequently awkward times . The bathroom telephone rang , its proximity causing the chief of staff to spill Maalox over his Savile Row suit coat . Awkwardly he grabbed the phone off the wall with his right hand while turning on the hot water faucet with his left and dousing a washcloth under the stream . As he answered he frantically rubbed the wet cloth over the white spots , grateful that they disappeared into the dark fabric . " Yes ? " " Congressman Kendrick has arrived at the East Gate , sir . The strip search is in progress . " " The what ? " " They 're checking him for weapons and explosives  --  " " Jesus , I never said he was a terrorist ! He 's in a government car with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate a strong degree of apprehension and displeas-ure- " Send him up here at once ! " " He may have to get dressed , sir . " " Shit ! " Six minutes later a quietly furious Evan Kendrick was ushered through the door by an apprehensive secretary . Rather than thanking the woman , Evan 's expression conveyed another message , more like Get out of here ,  |p319lady  , I want this man to myself . She left quickly as the chief of staff approached , his hand extended . Kendrick ignored it . " I 've heard about your fun and games over here , Dennison , " said Evan , his voice a low , ice-like monotone , " but when you presume to search a member of the House who 's here at your invitation  --  that 's what it had better be , you fucker ; you do n't give orders to me  --  you 've gone too far . " " A complete foul-up of instructions , Congressman ! My God , how can you think anything else ? " " With you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had too many run-ins with you . The horror stories are rampant , including the one in which you threw a punch at the member from Kansas who , I understand , flattened you out on the floor . " " That 's a lie ! He disregarded White House procedures , for which I 'm responsible . I may have touched him , merely to keep him in place , but that 's all . And that 's when he took me by surprise . " " I do n't think so . I heard he called you a two-bit major ' and you went up . " Distortion . Complete distortion ! " Dennison winced ; the acid was erupting . " Look , I apologize for strip search  --  " " Do n't . It did n't happen . I accepted removing the jacket , figuring it was standard , but when the guard mentioned my shirt and trousers , my far brighter escorts moved in . " " Then what the hell are you so uptight about ? " " That you even considered it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentality here that would . " " I could defend that accusation , but I wo n't bother . Now we 're going into the Oval Office and , for Christ 's sake , do n't confuse the man with all that Arab bullshit . Remember , he does n't know what happened and it wo n't do any good trying to explain positions . I 'll clarify everything for him later . " " How do I know you 're capable of that ? " " What ? " " You heard me . How do I know you 're either capable or reliable ? " " What are you talking about ? " " I think you 'd clarify whatever you want to clarify , telling him whatever you want him to hear . " " Who the hell are you to talk to me this way ? " " Someone probably as rich as you are . Also someone who 's getting out of this town , as I 'm sure Swann told you , so your political benediction is meaningless to me  --  I would n't accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I think you 're a bona fide rat . Not the cute Mickey Mouse variety , but the original animal . An ugly , scavenging , long-tailed rodent who spreads a lousy disease . It 's called nonaccountability . " " You do n't spare words , do you , Congressman ? " " I do n't have to . I 'm leaving . " " But he is n't ! And I want him strong , persuasive . He 's taking us into a new era . We 're standing tall again and it 's about time . We 're telling the crumbs of this world to shit or get off the pot ! " " Your expressions are as banal as you are . " " What are you ? Some fucking Ivy Leaguer with a degree in English ? Get with it , Congressman . We 're playing hardball here ; this is it ! Peoplein this administration move their bowels or they 're out . Got that ? " " I 'll try to remember . " " While you 're at it , remember he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? No waves at all ; everybody 's happy , got that ? " " You repeat yourself , do n't you ? " " I get things done , Kendrick . That 's the name of the hardball game . " " You 're a lean , mean machine , you are . " " So we do n't like each other . So what ? It 's no big deal  --  " I 've got that , " agreed Evan . " Let 's go . " " Not so fast , " said Kendrick firmly , turning away from Dennison and walking to a window as if the office were his , not that of the President 's man . " What 's the scenario ? That is the term , is n't it ? " " What do you mean ? " " What do you want from me ? " asked Kendrick , looking out at the White House lawn . " Since you 're doing the thinking , why am I here ? " " Because ignoring you would be counterproductive . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House 's chief of staff . " Counterproductive ? " " You 've got to be acknowledged , is that clear enough ? He ca n't sit on his ass and pretend you do n't exist , right ? " " Oh , I see . Say that during one of his entertaining although not terribly enlightening press conferences someone brings up my name , which is inevitable now . He ca n't very well say that he 's not sure whether I play for the Jets or the Giants , can he ? " " You got it . Let 's go . I 'll shape the conversation . " " You mean control it , do n't you ? " " Call it what you like , Congressman . He 's the greatest President of the twentieth century , and do n't you forget it . My job is to maintain the status quo. "  | " It 's not my job . " " The hell it is n't ! It 's all our jobs . I was in combat , young fella , and I watched men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , it was a goddamned holy things to see ! And this man , this President , has brought those values back , those sacrifices we prize so much . He 's moved this country in the right direction by the sheer force of his will , his personality , if you like . He 's the best ! " " But not necessarily the brightest , " interrupted Kendrick . " That does n't mean shit . Galileo would have made a lousy Pope and a worse Caesar . " " I suppose you 've got a point . " " I certainly do . Now the scenario  --  the explanation is simple and all too damned familiar . Some son of a bitch leaked the Oman story and you want it forgotten as soon as possible . " " I do ? " Dennison paused , studying Evan 's face as if it were decidedly unattractive . " That 's based directly on what that jerk Swann told the chairman of the Joint Chiefs  --  " " Why is Swann a jerk ? He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who came to see him . " " He let it happen . He was the CO of that operation and he let it happen and I 'll see him hung . " " Wrong past tense . " " What ? " " Never mind . But just to make sure we 're both using the same scenario , why do I want everything forgotten as soon as possible ? " " Because there could be reprisals against your lousy Arab friends over there . That 's what you told Swann and that 's what he told his superiors . You want to change it ? " " No , of course not , " said Kendrick softly . " The scenario 's the same . " " Good . We 'll schedule a short ceremony showing him thanking you on behalf of the whole damn country . No questions , just a restricted photo session and then you fade . " Dennison gestured toward the door ; both men started toward it . " You know something , Congressman ? " remarked the chief of staff , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has ruined one of the best whispering campaigns any administration could ask forpublic-relations-wise , that is . " " A whispering campaign ? " " Yeah . The longer we kept quiet , deflecting questions on the basis of national security , the more people thought the President forced tilt Oman settlement all by himself . "  | " He certainly conveyed that , " said Evan , smiling , not unkindly , as if he admired a talent he did not necessarily approve of . " I tell you he may not be an Einstein , but he 's still a fucking genius . " Dennison opened the door . Evan did not move . " May I remind you that eleven men and women were murdered in Masqat ? That two hundred others will have nightmares for the rest of their lives ? " " That 's right ! " replied Dennison . " And he said it  --  with goddamned tears in his eyes ! He said they were true American heroes , as brave as those who fought at Verdun , Omaha Beach , Panmunjom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant it , and we stood tall ! " " He said it as he narrowed the options , making his message clear , " agreed Kendrick . " If any one person was responsible for saving those two hundred thirty-six hostages , it must have been him . " " So ? " " Never mind . Let 's get this over with . " " You 're a fruitcake , Congressman . And you 're right , you do n't belong in this town . " Evan Kendrick had met the President of the United States only once . The meeting lasted for approximately five , perhaps six , seconds , during a White House reception for the freshmen congressmen of the chief executive'sparty . It had been mandatory for him to attend , according to Ann Mulcahy O'Reilly , who practically threatened to blow up the office if Evan refused to go to the affair . It was not that Kendrick disliked the man , he kept telling Annie ; it was just that he did not agree with a lot of things Langford Jennings espoused  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in answer to Mrs. O'Reilly 's question as to why he had run on the ticket , he could only reply that in an election the other party did not stand a chance of being elected . The predominant impression Evan had while briefly shaking hands with Langford Jennings in that reception line was more in the abstract than in the immediate , yet not totally so . The office was both intimidating and overwhelming . That a single human being could be entrusted with such awesome global power stretched any thinking man 's mind to its limits . A miscue during some horrible miscalculation could blow up the planet . Yet . . . yet . . . despite Kendrick 's personal evaluation of the man himself , which included a less than brilliant intellect and a proclivity for oversimplification as well as tolerance for such zealous clowns as Hcrlrt Dennison , there was about Langford Jennings a striking image that wasp323larger than life , an image that the ordinary citizen of the republic desperatelylonged for in the presidency . Evan had tried to understand the gossamer veil that shielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that scrutiny itself was irrelevant compared with his impact . So were the impacts of Nero , Caligula , any number of mad . authoritarian popes and emperors , and the ultimate villains of the twentiethcentury , Mussolini , Stalin and Hitler . Yet this man displayed none of the evil inherent in those others ; instead , he conveyed a strong , pervasivetrustworthiness that seemed to radiate from his inner self . Jenning : was also blessed with a large , attractive physique , and a much larger belief and the purity of his belief was everything to him . He was also one of the most charming , ingratiating men Kendrick had ever observed . " Damn , it 's good to meet you , Evan ! May I call you Evan , Mr. Con gressman ? " " Of course , Mr. President . " Jennings came around the desk in the Oval Office to shake hands gripping Kendrick 's left arm as their hands clasped . " I 've just finishec reading all that secret stuff about what you did , and I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a lot of others involved , sir . Without them I 'd have beet killed . " " I understand that . Sit down , Evan , sit , sit ! " The President returnee to his chair ; Herbert Dennison remained standing . " What you did , Evan as a single individual , will be a textbook lesson for generations of young people in America . You took the whip in your hands and made the dam thing snap . " " Not by myself , sir . There 's a long list of people who risked their live to help me  --  and several lost their lives . As I said , I 'd be dead if it weren ' for them . There were at least a dozen Omanis , from the young sultai down , and an Israeli commando unit that reached me when I literally ha ( only a few hours to live . My execution was already scheduled  --  " " Yes , I understand all that , Evan , " interrupted Langford Jennings nodding and frowning compassionately . " I also understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of their involvement , and ou intelligence community here in Washington refuses to risk exposing ou personnel in the Persian Gulf . " " The Gulf of Oman , Mr. President . " " I 'm on your side , " said Jennings , grinning his famous self-deprecatin grin that had charmed a nation . " I 'm not sure I know one from the othe but I 'll learn tonight . As my hatchet cartoonists would balloon it , my wif wo n't give inc my cookies and milk till I get it all straight . "  | " That would be unfair , sir . It 's a geographically complex part of the world if a person 's not familiar with it . " " Yes , well , somehow I think even I might master it with a couple of grammar school maps . " " I never meant to imply  --  " " It 's okay , Evan , it 's my fault . I slip now and then . The main issue here is what do we do with you . What do we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protecting the lives of agents and subagents who are working for us in an explosive part of the globe ? " " I 'd say those necessary restrictions call for keeping everything quiet , classified  --  " " It 's a little late for that , Evan , " broke in Jennings . " National security alibis can only go so far . Beyond a certain point you arouse too much curiosity ; that 's when things can get sticky  --  and dangerous . " " Also , " added Herbert Dennison , gruffly breaking his silence , " as I mentioned to you , Congressman , the President ca n't simply ignore you . It would n't be the generous or patriotic thing to do . Now , the way I see it  --  and the President agrees with me  --  we 'll schedule a short photo sessionhere in the Oval Office , where you 'll be congratulated by the President , along with a series of shots showing you both in what 'll look like confidential conversation . That 'll be consistent with the intelligence grayoutrequired by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't tip off your tactics to those Arab scumballs . " " Without a lot of Arabs I would n't have gotten anywhere , and you goddamned well know it , " said Kendrick , his angry eyes rigid on the chief of staff . " Oh , we know it , Evan , " interrupted Jennings , his own eyes obviously amused by what he observed . " At least I know it . By the way , Herb , I had a call from Sam Winters this afternoon and I think he has a hell of an idea that would n't violate any of our security concerns , and , as a matter of fact , could explain them . " " Samuel Winters is not necessarily a friend , " countered Dennison . " He 's withheld a number of policy endorsements we could have used with Congress . " " Then he did n't agree with us . Does that make him an enemy ? Hell , if it does , you 'd better send half the marine guards up to our family quarters . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to presidents of both parties for as long as I can remember . Only a damn fool would n't accept calls from him . " " He should have been routed through mc. " r " You see , Evan ? " said the President , his head askew , grinning mischievously . " I can play in the sandbox but I ca n't choose my friends . " " That 's hardly what I  --  " " It certainly is what you meant , Herb , and that 's okay with me . You get things done around here  --  which you constantly remind me of , and that 's okay , too . " " What did Mr. Winters  --  Professor Winters  --  suggest ? " asked Dennison , the academic title spoken sarcastically . " Well , he 's a professor , ' Herb , but he 's not your average run-of-themillteacher , is he ? I mean , if he wanted to , I suppose he could buy a couple of pretty decent universities . Certainly the one I got out of could be his for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his idea ? " pressed the chief of staff anxiously . " That I award my friend , Evan , here , the Medal of Freedom . " The President turned to Kendrick . " That 's the civilian equivalent of the CongressionalMedal of Honor , Evan . " " I know that , sir . I do n't deserve it , nor do I want it . " " Well , Sam made a couple of things clear to me and I think he 's right . To begin with , you do deserve it , and whether you want it or not , I 'd look like a chintzy bastard not awarding it to you . And that , fellas , I will not accept . Is that clear , Herb ? " " Yes , Mr. President , " said Dennison , his voice choked . " However , you should know that although Representative Kendrick is standing unopposedfor reelection to guarantee you a congressional seat , he intends to resign his office in the near future . There 's no point , since he has his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The point , Herb , is that I wo n't be a chintzy bastard . Anyway , he looks like he could be my younger brother  --  we could get mileage out of that . Sam Winters brought it to my attention . The image of a go-getting American family , he called it . Not bad , would n't you say ? " " It 's not necessary , Mr. President , " rejoined Dennison , now frustrated , his hoarse voice conveying the fact that he could not push much further . " The Congressman 's fears are valid . He thinks there could be reprisals against friends of his in the Arab world . " The President leaned back in his chair , his eyes fixed blankly on his chief of staff . " That does n't wash with me . This is a dangerous world , and we 'll only make it more dangerous by knuckling under to such speculative crap . But in that vein I 'll explain to the country  --  from a position of strength , not fear  --  that I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy . You were right about thatp326part , Herb . Actually , Sam Winters said it to me first . Also , I will not look like a chintzy bastard . It simply is n't me . Understood , Herb ? " " Yes , sir . " " Evan , " said Jennings , his infectious grin again creasing his face . " You 're my kind of man . What you did was terrific  --  what I read about it  --  and this President wo n't stint ! By the way , Sam Winters mentioned that I should say we worked together . What the hell , my people worked with you , and that 's the gospel truth . " " Mr. President  --  " " Schedule it , Herb . I looked at my calendar , if that does n't offend you . Next Tuesday , ten o'clock in the morning . That way we 'll hit all the networks ' nightly news , and Tuesday 's a heavy night . " " But Mr. President  --  " began a flustered Dennison . " Also , Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room . I 'll be damned if I 'll be a chintzy bastard ! It 's not me ! " A furious Herbert Dennison walked back to his office with Kendrick in tow for the purpose of carrying out the presidential order : Shake out the specifics for the award ceremony in the Blue Room on the followings , Tuesday . With the Marine Band . So intense was the chief of staff 's anger that his large , firm jaw was locked in silence . " I 'm really on your case , are n't I , Herbie ? " said Evan , noting the bull-like quality of Dennison 's stride . " You 're on my case and my name is n't Herbie . " " Oh , I do n't know . You looked like a Herbie back there . The man cut you down , did n't he ? " " There are times when the President is inclined to listen to the wrong people . " Kendrick looked over at the chief of staff as they'marched down the wide hallway . Dennison ignored the tentative greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several of whom stared wide-eyed at Evan , obviously recognizing him . " I do n't get it , " said Kendrick . " Our mutual dislike aside , what 's your problem ? I 'm the one being stuck where I do n't want to be , not you . Why are you howling ? " " Because you talk too goddamned much . I watched you on the Foxley show and that little display in your office the next morning . You 're counterproductive . " " You like that word , do n't you ? "  --  " I 've got a lot of others I can use . "  | " I 'm sure you do . Then again I may have a surprise for you . " " Another one ? What the hell is it ? " " Wait till we get to your office . " Dennison ordered his secretary to hold all calls except those on Priority Red . She nodded her head rapidly in obedient acknowledgment , but in a cowed voice explained . " You have more than a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent callback . " " Are they Priority Red ? " The woman shook her head . " What did I just tell you ? " With these courteous words the chief of staff propelled the Congressman into his office and slammed the door shut . " Now , what 's this surprise of yours ? " " You know , Herbie , I really must give you some advice , " replied Evan , walking casually over to the window where he had stood previously ; he turned and looked at Dennison . " You can be rude to the help as much as you like or as long as they 'll take it , but do n't you ever again put your hand on a member of the House of Representatives and shove him into your office as if you were about to administer a strap . " " I did n't shove you ! " " I interpreted it that way and that 's all that matters . You have a heavy hand , Herbie . I 'm sure my distinguished colleague from Kansas felt the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Herbert Dennison paused , then laughed softly . The prolonged deep chuckle was reflective , neither angry nor antagonistic ; more the sound of relief than anything else . He loosened his tie anc casually sat down in a leather armchair in front of his desk . " Christ , I wish 1 were ten or twelve years younger , Kendrick , and I 'd whip your tail  --  1 could have done it even at that age . At sixty-three , however , you learn that caution is the better part of valor , or whatever it is . I do n't care to be decked again ; it 's a little harder to get up these days . " " Then do n't ask for it , do n't provoke it . You 're a very provocative man . " Sit down , Congressman  --  in my chair , at my desk . Go on , go ahead . ' Evan did so . " How does it feel ? You get a tingling in your spine , a rush of blood to your head ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , well , I guess we 're different . You see , down the hall is the most powerful man on earth , and he relies on me , and to tell you the truth , I'rr no genius , either . I just keep the booby hatch running . I oil the machiner so the wheels turn , and the oil I use has a lot of acidity in it , just like me But it 's the only lubricant I 've got and it works . " " I suppose there 's a point to this , " said Kendrick.  | " I suppose there is and I do n't think you 'll be offended . Since I 've been here  --  since we 've been here  --  everybody bows like gooks in front of me , saying all kinds of flattering things with big smiles . . . only with eyes that tell me they 'd rather put a bullet in my head . I 've been through it before ; it does n't bother me . But here you show up and you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshing . I can deal with that . I mean I like your not liking me and my not liking you  --  does that make sense ? " " In a perverse sort of way , I suppose . But then you 're a perverse man . " " Why ? Because I 'd rather talk straight than in circles ? Pointless lip service and ass-kissing drivel only waste time . If I could get rid of both , we 'd all accomplish ten times what we do now . " " Did you ever let anyone know that ? " " I 've tried , Congressman , so help me God , I 've tried . And you know something ? Nobody believes me . " " Would you if you were they ? " " Probably not , and maybe if they did the booby hatch would turn into a certifiable looney bin . Think about it , Kendrick . There 's more than one side to my perversity . " " I 'm not qualified to comment on that , but this conversation makes things easier for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to lay on me ? " " Yes , " agreed Evan . " You see , up to a point I 'll do what you want me to do  --  for a price . It 's my pact with the Devil . " " You flatter me . " " I do n't mean to . I 'm not given to ass-kissing drivel , either , because it wastes my time . As I read you , I 'm counterproductive ' because I 've made some noise about several things I feel pretty strongly about and what you 've heard goes against your grain . Am I right , so far ? " " Right on the tiny tin dime , kiddo . You may look different , but to me there 's a lot of that stringy , long-haired protest crap in you . " " And you think that if I 'm given any kind of platform there might be more to come , and that really frosts your apricots . Right again ? " " Right in the fly 's asshole . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments . He 's taken us out of the pansy patch ; we 're riding a strong Chinook wind and it feels good . " " I wo n't try to follow that . " " You probably could n't  --  " " But basically you want two things from me , " continued Evan rapidly . " The first is for me to say as little as possible and nothing at all that calls into question the wisdom emanating from this booby hatch of yours . Ali I close ? "  | " You could n't get closer without being arrested . " " And the second is in what you said before . You want me to fade  --  and fade fast . How am I doing ? " " You 've got the brass ring . " " All right , I 'll do both  --  up to a point . After this little ceremony next Tuesday , which neither of us wants but we lose to the man , my office will be flooded with demands from the media . Newspapers , radio , television , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm news and they want to sell their merchandise  --  " " You 're not telling me anything I do n't know or do n't like , " interruptedDennison . " I 'll turn everything down , " said Kendrick flatly . " I wo n't grant any interviews . I wo n't speak publicly on any issue , and I 'll fade just as fast as I can . " " I 'd kiss you right now except that you mentioned something kind of counterproductive , like up to a point . ' What the hell does that mean ? " " It means that in the House I 'll vote my conscience , and if I 'm challengedon the floor I 'll give my reasons as dispassionately as I can . But that 's in the House ; off the Hill I 'm not available for comment . " " We get most of our PR flak off the Hill , not on it , " said the White House chief of staff reflectively . " The Congressional Record and cable 's C-Span cameras do n't put a dent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks to that smooth son of a bitch Sam Winters , your offer is so irresistible I wonder what the price is . You have a price , I assume . " " I want to know who blew the whistle on me . Who leaked the Oman story so very , very professionally . " " You think I do n't ? " erupted Dennison , bouncing forward . " I 'd have the bastards deep-sixed fifty miles off Newport News in torpedo cans ! " " Then help me find out . That 's my price , take it or take me replaying the Foxley show all over the country , calling you and your crowd exactly what I honestly thin you are . A bunch of bumbling Neanderthals faced with a complicated world you ca n't understand . " " You 're the fucking expert ? " " Hell , no . I just know that you 're not . I watch and I listen and see you cutting off so many people who could help you because there 's a zig or a zag in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I learned something this afternoon ; I saw it , heard it . The President of the United States talked to Samuel Winters , a man you disapprove of , but when you explained why you did n't like him , that he withheld endorsementsthat could help you with Congress , Langford Jennings saidp330something that impressed the hell out of me . He said to you that if this Sam Winters disagreed with some policy or other , it did not make him an enemy . " The President frequently does n't understand who his enemies are . He spots ideological allies quickly and sticks by them  --  sometimes too long , frankly  --  but often he 's too generous to detect those who would erode what he stands for . " " That 's about the weakest and most presumptuous argument I 've ever heard , Herbie . What are you shielding your man from ? Diverse opin-ions ? " " Let 's go back to your big surprise , Congressman . I like the topic better . " " I 'm sure you do . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us find out who leaked the Oman story ? " " Essentially what I learned from Frank Swann . As head of the OHIOFour-Zerounit , he was the liaison to the secretaries of Defense and State as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , all of whom knew about me . He told me to rule them out as possible leaks , however  --  " " Far out , " interrupted Dennison . " They 've got soft-boiled eggs all over their faces . They ca n't answer the simplest questions , which makes them look like prime idiots . Incidentally , they 're not idiots and they 've been around long enough to know what maximum-classified is and why it 's there . What else ? " " Then outside of you  --  and frankly I rule you out only because my surfacing is about as counterproductive ' as your fractured gray cells could conjure  --  that leaves three other people . " " Who are they ? " " The first is a man named Lester Crawford at the Central Intelligence Agency ; the second , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a woman , Adrienne Rashad , who 's apparently special property and operates out of Cairo . " " What about them ? " " According to Swann , they 're the only ones who knew my identity when I was flown over to Masqat . " " That 's our personnel , " said Dennison pointedly . " What about your people over there ? " " I ca n't say it 's impossible , but I think it 's remote . The few I reached , except for the young sultan , are so removed from any contact with Washingtonthat I 'd have to consider them last , if at all . Ahmat , whom I 've known for years , certainly would n't for a lot of reasons , starting with hisA0p331throne and , equally important , his ties with this government . Of the four men I spoke to on the telephone , only one responded and he was killed for it  --  undoubtedly with the consent of the others . They were frightened out of their skins . They did n't want anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that included anyone they knew who did meet with me and who might make them suspect . You 'd have to have been there to understand . They all live with the terrorist syndrome , with daggers at their throats  --  and at the throat of every member of their families . There 'd been reprisals , a son killed , a daughter raped and disfigured because cousins or uncles called for action against the Palestinians . I do n't believe any of those men would have spoken my name . to a deaf dog . " " Christ , what kind of a world do those goddamned Arabs live in ? " " One in which the vast majority try to survive and make lives for themselves and their children . And we have n't helped , you bigoted bas-tard . " Dennison cocked his head and frowned . " I may have deserved that shot , Congressman , I 'll have to think about it . Not so long ago it was fashionable not , . to like Jews , not to trust them , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scheme of our dislikes . Maybe it 's all bullshit , who knows ? . . . But what I want to know now is who sprung you out of the top-secret woodwork . You figure it 's someone from our ranks . " " It has to be . Swann was approached  --  fraudulently approached , as it turns out  --  by a blond-haired man with a European accent who had in-depth data on me . That information could only have come from governmentfiles  --  my congressional background check probably . He tried to tie me in with the Oman situation , but Swann firmly denied it , saying he had specifically turned me down . However , Frank had the impression that the man was n't convinced . " " We know about the blond spook , " broke in Dennison . " We ca n't find him . " " But he dug and found someone else , someone who confirmed either intentionally or unintentionally what he was tracking down . If we rule you out , and if we also rule out State , Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grayson or the Rashad woman . " " Cross out the first two , " said the White House chief of staff . " Early this morning I grilled Crawford right here in this office , and he was ready to challenge me to a game of Saigon roulette for even suggesting the possibility . As far as Grayson is concerned , I reached him in Bahrain five hours ago and lie danuied near had apoplexy thinking we even conside'rcclp332him the leak . He read the black-operations book to me as if I were the dumbest kid on the block who should be thrown into solitary for calling him on an unsecured line in foreign territory . Like Crawford , Grayson 's an old-line professional . Neither one would risk throwing away his life 's work over you , and neither could be tricked into doing it . " Kendrick leaned forward in Dennison 's chair , his elbows on the desk . He stared at the far wall of the office , conflicting thoughts racing through his mind . Khalehla , born Adrienne Rashad , had saved his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She was also a close friend of Ahmat , who could be damaged by his association with her , and Evan had hurt the young sultan enough without adding a turned intelligence agent to the list . Yet Khalehla had understood him when he needed understanding ; she was kind when he needed kindness because he was so afraid  --  both for his life and for his inadequacies . If she had been tricked into revealing him and he exposed her ineptness , she was finished in a job she intensely believed in . . . . Yet if she had not been tricked , if for reasons of her own she had exposed him  --  then all he would expose was her betrayal . Which was the truth ? Dupe or liar ? Whichever it was , he had to find out for himself without the specter of official scrutiny . Above all , dupe or liar , he had to know whom she had reached or who had reached her . For only the " who " could answer the " why " he had been exposed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Then out of the seven of you , there 's only one unaccountedfor . " " The woman , " agreed Dennison , nodding his head . " I 'll put her on a revolving spit over the hottest goddamn fire you ever saw . " " No , you wo n't , " countered Kendrick . " You and your people wo n't get near her until I give you the word  --  if I give it . And we 're going to go one step further . No one 's to know you 're flying her back here  --  under cover , I think is the term . Absolutely no one . Is that understood ? " " Who the hell are you  --  " " We 've been through this , Herbie . Remember next Tuesday in the Blue Room ? With the Marine Band and all those reporters and television cameras ? I 'll have a great big platform to climb on if I want to and express a few opinions . Believe me , you 'll be among the first targets , decked ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being blackmailed be so bold as to ask why this female spook gets preferred treatment ? " " Sure , " replied Evan , his gaze settled on the chief of staff . " That woman saved my life and you 're not going to ruin hers by letting her own people know you 've got her tinder your well-advertised White House shotgun . You 've done enough of that around here . "  | " All right , all right ! But let 's get one thing clear . If she 's the sieve , you turn her over to me . " " That 'll depend , " said Kendrick , sitting back . " On what , for Christ 's sake ? " " On the how and the why . " " More riddles , Congressman ? " " Not for me , " answered Evan , suddenly rising from the chair . " Get me out of here , Dennison . Also , since I ca n't go home , either to my house in Virginia or even out to Colorado , without being swamped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a cabin in the country under another name ? I 'll pay for a month or whatever 's necessary . I just want a few days to figure things out before I go back to the office . " " It 's been taken care of , " said the chief of staff abruptly . " Actually , it was Jennings 's idea  --  to put you on ice over the weekend in one of those sterile houses in Maryland . " " What the hell is a sterile house ? Please use language I can under-stand . " " Let 's put it this way . You 're the guest of the President of the United States in a place no one can find that is reserved for people we do n't want found . It dovetailed with my considered opinion that Langford Jennings should make the first public statements about you . You 've been seen here , and as sure as rabbits have little rabbits the word 'll get out . " " You 're the scenario writer . What do we say  --  what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's easy . Your safety . It 's the President 's primary concern after conferring with our counterterrorist experts . Do n't worry , our writers will come up with something that 'll make the women cry into their handkerchiefsand the men want to go out and march in a parade . And since Jennings has the last word in these things , it 'll probably include some whacked-up image of a powerful knight of the Round Table looking after a brave younger brother who carried out a joint dangerous mission . Shit ! " " And if there 's any truth to the reprisal theory , " added Kendrick , " it 'll make me a target . " " That 'd be nice , " agreed Dennison , nodding again . " Call me when you 've made arrangements for the Rashad woman . " Evan sat in the leather lounge chair in the study of the impressive sterile house on Maryland 's Eastern Shore in the township of Cynwid Hollow . Outside , within the walls of the floodlit grounds , guards moved in and outp334of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rifles at the ready , their eyes alert . Kendrick snapped off the third replay he had watched on television of President Langford Jennings 's suddenly called press conference regarding one Congressman Evan Kendrick of Colorado . It was more outrageous than Dennison had projected , filled with gut-wrenching pauses accompanied by a constant series of well-rehearsed grins that so obviously conveyedthe pride and the agony beneath the surface of the man smiling . The President once again said everything in general terms and nothing specific  --  except in one area : Until all proper security measures are in place , I have asked Congressman Kendrick , a man we are all so proud of , to remain in protective seclusion . And with this request , I hereby give dire warning . Should cowardly terrorists anywhere make any attempt on the life of my good friend , my close colleague , someone I look upon no less than I would a younger brother , the full might of the United States will be employed by ground , sea and air against determined enclaves of those responsible . Determined ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around trying to find out where it was . It was across the room on a desk ; he swung his legs off the lounger and walked to the startlingly intrusive instrument . " Yes ? " " She 's flying over on military transport with a senior attache from the embassy in Cairo . She 's listed as a secretarial aide , the name 's unimportant . The ETA is seven o'clock in the morning our time . She 'll be in Maryland by ten at the latest . " " What does she know ? " " Nothing . " " You had to say something , " insisted Kendrick . " She was told it was new and urgent instructions from her government , instructions that could be transmitted only in person over here . " " She bought that nonsense ? " " She did n't have a choice . She was picked up at her flat in Cairo and has been in protective custody ever since . Have a lousy night , you bas-tard . " " Thanks , Herbie . " Evan hung up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning 's confrontation with the woman he had known as Khalehla , a woman he had made love to in a frenzy of fear and exhaustion . That impulsive act and the desperation that led to it had to be forgotten . He had to determine whether he wasp335re-meeting an enemy or a friend . Regardless , there was now a schedule , at least for the next twelve or fifteen hours . It was time to call Ann O'Reilly and , through her , reach Manny . It did not matter who knew where he was ; he was the official guest of the President of the United States.  |p336Emmanuel  Weingrass sat in the red Naugahyde booth with the stocky , mustached owner of the Mesa Verde cafe . The past two hours had been stressful for Manny , somewhat reminiscent of those crazy days in Paris when he had worked with the Mossad . The current situation was nowhere near as melodramatic and his adversaries were hardly lethal , but still he was an elderly man who had to get from one place to another without being seen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terrorist scouts without being noticed from Sacre-Coeur to the Boulevard de la Madeleine . Here in Colorado he had to get from Evan 's house to the town of Mesa Verde without being stopped and locked up by his team of nurses , all of whom were charging about because of the activity outside . " How did you do it ? " asked Gonzalez-Gonzalez , the cafe 's owner as he poured Weingrass a glass of whisky . " Civilized man 's second oldest need for privacy , Gee-Gee . The toilet . I went to the toilet and climbed out a window . Then I mingled with the crowd taking pictures with one of Evan 's cameras , like a real photographer , you know , until I got a taxi here . " " Hey , man , " interrupted Gonzalez-Gonzalez . " Those cats are making dineros today ! " " Thieves , they are ! I climbed in and the first thing the Boni f f said to me was One hundred dollars to the airport , mister . ' So I said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission will be interested to hear about the new Verde rates , ' and he says to me , ' Oh , it 's you , Mr. Weingrass , just a joke , Mr. Weingrass , ' and then I tell him , ' Charge ' em two hundred and take me to Gee-Gee 's ! ' " Both men broke into loud laughter as the pay telephone on the wall beyond the booth erupted in a staccato ring . Gonzalez placed his hand on Manny 's arm . " Let Garcia get it , " he said . " Why ? You said my boy called twice before ! " " Garcia knows what to say . I just told him . " " Tell me ! " " He 'll give the Congressman the number of my office phone and tell him to call back in two minutes . " " Gee-Gee , what the hell are you doing ? " " A couple of minutes after you came in , a gringo I do n't know arrived . " " So what ? You get plenty of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't belong here , Manny . He ai n't got no raincoat or no hat or no camera , but he still do n't belong here . He 's got on a suit  --  with a vest . " Weingrass started to turn his head . " Do n't , " ordered Gonzalez , now gripping Weingrass 's arm . " Every now and then he looks over here from his table . He 's got you on his mind . " " So what do we do ? " " Just wait and get up when I tell you to . " The waiter named Garcia hung up the pay phone , coughed once , and went over to the dark-suited , red-haired man with a vest . He leaned down and said something close to the well-dressed customer 's face . The man stared coldly at his unexpected messenger ; the waiter shrugged and crossed back to the bar . The man slowly , unobtrusively , put several bills on the table , got up , and walked out the nearby entrance . " Now , " whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ten seconds later they were in the owner 's disheveled office . " The Congressman will call back in about a minute , " said GeeGee , indicating the chair behind a desk that had seen better days decades ago . " You 're sure it was Kendrick ? " asked Weingrass . " Garcia 's cough told me yes . " " What did Jose say to the guy at the table ? " " That he believed the message on the telephone must be for him , since no other customer fit his description . " " What was the message ? " " Quite simple , amigo . It was important for him to reach his people outside . "  | " Just that ? " " He left , did n't he ? That tells us something , does n't it ? " " Like what ? " " Uno , he has people to reach , no ? Dos , they are either outside this grand establishment or he can talk to them by other means of communication  --  namely , a fancy telephone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in here in his also-fancy suit to have a Tex-Mex beer that practically chokes him  --  as my fine sparkling wine often chokes you , no ? Cuatro , he is no doubt f ederale . " " Government ? " asked Manny , astonished . " Personally , of course , I have never been involved with illegals crossing the borders from my beloved country to the south , but the stories reach even such innocents as myself . . . . We know what to look for , my friend . Comprende , hombre ? " " I always said , " said Weingrass , sitting behind the desk . " Find the classiest non-class joints in town and you can learn more about life than in all the sewers of Paris . " " Paris , France , means a great deal to you , does n't it , Manny ? " " It 's fading , amigo . I 'm not sure why , but it 's fading . Something 's happening here with my boy and I ca n't understand it . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes ? " " He is my son . " The telephone rang , and Weingrass yanked it up to his ear as Gonzalez-Gonzalez went out the door . " Air-head , is that you ? " " What have you got out there , Manny ? " asked Kendrick over the line from the sterile house on Maryland 's Eastern Shore . " A Mossad unit covering you ? " " Far more effective , " answered the old architect from the Bronx . " There are no accountants , no CPAs counting the shekels over an egg cream . Now , you . What the hell happened ? " " I do n't know , I swear I do n't know ! " Evan recounted his day in detail , from Sabri Hassan 's startling news about the Oman revelations while he was in his pool to his hiding out in a cheap motel in Virginia ; from his confrontation with Frank Swann of the State Department to his arrival at the White House under escort ; from his hostile meeting with the White House chief of staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , who proceeded to louse up everything by scheduling an award ceremony in the Blue Room next Tuesday  --  with the Marine Band . Finally , to the fact that the woman named Khalehla , who had first saved his life in Bahrain , was in reality a case officer in the Central Intelligence Agency and was being flown over for him to question.  | " From what you 've told me , she had nothing to do with exposing you . " " Why not ? " " Because you believed her when she said she was an Arab filled with shame , you told me that . In some ways , Air-head , I know you better than you know yourself . You are not easily fooled about such matters . It 's what made you so good with the Kendrick Group . . . . For this woman to expose you would only add to her shame and further inflame the crazy world she lives in . " " She 's the only one left , Manny . The others would n't ; they could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For God 's sake , who ? These were the only people who knew I was there . " " You just said this Swann told you a blond creep with a foreign accent figured you were in Masqat . Where did he get his information ? " " No one can find him , not even the White House . " " Maybe I know people who can find him , " interrupted Weingrass . " No , Manny , " insisted Kendrick firmly . " This is n't Paris and those Israelis are way off limits . I owe them too much , although someday I 'd like you to explain to me the interest they had in a certain hostage at the embassy . " " I was never told , " said Weingrass . " I knew there was an initial plan the unit had trained for and I assumed it was designed to reach someone inside , but they never discussed it in front of me . Those people know bow to keep their mouths shut . . . . What 's your next move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you . " " After that . " " You have n't been watching television . " " I 'm at Gee-Gee 's . He only allows videotapes , remember ? He 's got a replay on one of the ' 82 Series , and most everyone at the bar thinks it 's today . What 's on television ? " " The President . He announced that I 'm in protective seclusion . " " Sounds like jail to me . " " In a way it is , but the prison 's tolerable and the warden 's given me privileges . " " Do I get a number ? " " I would n't know it . There 's nothing printed on the phone , only a blank strip , but I 'll keep you informed . I 'll call you if I move . Nobody could trace this line and it does n't matter if they did . " " Okay , now let me ask you something . Did you mention me to any-one ? " " Good God , no . You may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of other people deserved credit besides myself , but I never used your name . Why ? " " I 'm being followed . " " What ? " " It 's a wrinkle I do n't like . Gee-Gee says the clown on my tail is federal and that there are others with him . " " Maybe Dennison picked you out from the file and assigned you protec-tion . " " From what ? Even in Paris I 'm vault-tight  --  if I was n't , I 'd have been dead three years ago . And what makes you think I 'm in any file ? Outside of the unit no one knew my name and none of our names were used in that conference the morning we all left . Finally , Air-head , if I 'm being protected , it 'd be a good idea to let me know about it . Because if I 'm dangerous enough to warrant that kind of protection , I might just blow the head off someone I do n't know who 's protecting me . " " As usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounce of logic in your normal pound of implausibility . I 'll check on it . " " Do that . I may not have too many years left but I would n't want them cut short by a bullet in my head  --  from either side . Call me tomorrow , because now I 've got to get back to the coven before the inhabitants report my departure to the head police warlock . " " Give my regards to Gee-Gee , " added Evan . " And tell him that when I 'm home he 's to stay the hell out of the importing business . Also , thank him , Manny . " Kendrick hung up the phone , his hand still on it . He picked it up and dialed O. " Operator , " said a somewhat hesitant female voice after more unansweredrings than seemed normal . " I 'm not sure why , " began Evan , " but I have an idea that you 're not an ordinary run-of-the-mill operator for the Bell Telephone Company . " " Sir . . . ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Kendrick and I have to reach Mr. Herbert Dennison , the White House chief of staff , as soon as possible  --  it 's urgent . I 'm asking you to do your best to find him and have him call me within the next five minutes . If that 's impossible , I 'll be forced to call my secretary 's husband , who 's a lieutenant on the Washington police , and tell him I 'm being held prisoner at a location I 'm fairly certain I can identify accurately . " " Sir , please ! " " I think I 'm being reasonable and very clear , " interrupted Evan . " Mr. Dennison is to reach me within the next five minutes , and the countdown'sbegun . Thank you , Operator , have a good day . " Again Kendrickp341hung up the phone , but now he removed his hand and walked over to a wall bar , which held an ice bucket and assorted bottles of expensive whisky . He poured himself a drink , looked at his watch , and proceeded toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds . He was amused at the sight of a croquet course bordered by white wrought-iron furniture ; he was less amused by the sight of a marine guard dressed in the casual , unmilitary uniform of the estate 's staff . He was pacing a garden path near the stone wall , his uncasual , very military repeating rifle angled in front . Manny was right : he was in jail . Moments later the telephone rang and the congressman from Colorado walked back to it . " Hello , Herbie , how are you ? " " How am I , you son of a bitch ? I 'm in the goddamned shower , that 's how I am . Wet ! What do you want ? " " I want to know why Weingrass is being followed . I want to know why his name ever surfaced anywhere , and you 'd better have a damn good explanation , like his personal well-being . " " Back up , ingrate , " said the chief of staff curtly . " What the hell is a Weingrass ? Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an architect of international renown . He 's also a close friend of mine and he 's staying at my house in Colorado , and for reasons that I do n't have to give you , his being there is extremely confidential . Where and to whom have you circulated his name ? " " I ca n't circulate what I 've never heard of , you fruitcake . " " You 're not lying to me , are you , Herbie ? Because if you are , I can make the next few weeks very embarrassing for you . " " If I thought that lying would get you off my back , I 'd go to the well , but I have n't got any lies where a Weingrass is concerned . I do n't know who he is , so help me . " " You read the debriefing reports on Oman , did n't you ? " " It 's one file and buried . Of course I read it . " " Weingrass 's name never appeared ? " " No , and I 'd remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not to Weingrass . " Kendrick paused , but not long enough for Dennisonto interrupt . " Could anyone in the CIA or NSA or any of those outfits put a guest of mine under surveillance without informing you ? " " No way ! " shouted the White House suzerain . " Where you and the rutabaga you 've laid on us are concerned , no one moves sideways for an inch without my knowing about it ! " " One last question . In the Oman file , was there any mention of the person flying hack with me from Bahrain ? "  |p342It  was Dennison 's turn to pause . " You 're a little obvious , Congress-man . " " You 're a little closer to those soft-boiled eggs over your face . If you think I 'm bad news for you and your man now , do n't even speculate on the architect 's connection . Leave it alone . " " I 'll leave it alone , " agreed the chief of staff . " With a name like Weingrass I can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good . Now , just answer my question . What was in the file about the flight from Bahrain to Andrews ? " " The cargo consisted of you and an old Arab in Western clothes , a longtime subagent for Cons Op who was being flown over for medical treatment . His name was Ali something-or-other ; State cleared him and he vanished . That 's straight , Kendrick . No one in this government is aware of a Mr. Weingrass . " " Thanks , Herb . " " Thanks for the Herb . ' Is there anything I can do ? " Evan stared at the casement window , then at the floodlit grounds and the marine guard outside and everything the scene represented . " I 'm going to do you a favor and say no , " he said softly . " At least for now . But you can clarify something for me . This phone has a tap on it , does n't it ? " " Not the usual variety . There 's a little black box like those on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tapes processed under the strictest security measures . " " Can you stop the operation for , say , thirty minutes or so , until I reach someone ? You 'd want it that way , believe me . " " I 'll accept that . . . . Sure , there 's an override on the line ; our people use it a lot when they 're in those houses . Give me five minutes and call Moscow , if you like . " " Five minutes . " " May I go back to my shower now ? " " Try Clorox this time . " Kendrick replaced the phone and took out his wallet , slipping his index finger under the flap behind his Colorado driver 's license . He removed the scrap of paper with Frank Swann 's two private telephone numbers written on it and again looked at his watch . He would wait ten minutes and hope that the deputy director of Consular Operationswas at one place or the other . He was . At his apartment , of course . After curt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was . " How 's protective seclusion ' ? " asked Swann , sounding weary . " I 've been to several of those places when we 've interrogated defectors . I hopep343you 've got one with stables or at least two pools , one inside , naturally . They 're all alike ; I think the government buys them as political payoffs for the rich who get tired of their estates and want to buy new ones gratis . I hope somebody 's listening . I do n't have a pool anymore . " " There 's a croquet course , I 've seen that . " " Small time . What have you got to tell me ? Am I any closer to getting off the hook ? " " Maybe . At least I 've tried to take some heat off you . . . . Frank , I 've got to ask you a question and we can both say anything we like , use any names we like . There 's no tap on the phone here now . " " Who told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed him ? Incidentally , I could n't care less if this transcript'sgiven to him . " " I believe him because he has a clue as to what I 'm going to say and wants to put a couple of thousand miles between the administration and what we 're going to talk about . He said we 're on an override . ' " " He 's right . He 's afraid of some loose cannon hearing your words . What is it ? " " Manny Weingrass , and through him linkage to the Mossad  --  " " I told you , that 's a no-no , " broke in the deputy director . " Okay , we 're really on override . Go ahead . " " Dennison told me that the Oman file lists the cargo on the plane from Bahrain to Andrews Air Force Base on that last morning as consisting of me and an old Arab in Western clothing who was a subagent for Consular Operations  --  " " And who was being brought over here for medical treatment , " interruptedSwann . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family that much . " " You 're sure that was the wording ? " " Who would know it better ? I wrote it . " " You ? Then you knew it was Weingrass ? " " It was n't difficult . Your instructions relayed by Grayson were pretty damned clear . You demanded  --  demanded , mind you  --  that an unnamed person accompany you on that plane back to the States  --  " " I was covering for the Mossad . " " Obviously , and so was I. You see , bringing someone in like that is against the rules  --  forget the law  --  unless he 's on our books . So I put him on the hooks as someone else . " " But how did you know it was Manny ? " ' That was the easiest part . I spoke to the chief of the Bahrainian Royalp334Guards , who was assigned as your covert escort . The physical description was probably enough , but when he told me that the old bastard kicked one of his men in the knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport , I knew it was Weingrass . His reputation , as they say , has always preceded him . " " I appreciate your doing that , " said Evan softly . " Both for him and for me . " It was the only way of thanking you that I could think of . " " Then I can assume that no one in Washington intelligence circles knows that Weingrass was involved in Oman . " " Absolutely . Forget Masqat , he 's a nonperson . He 's just not among the living over here . " " Dennison did n't even know who he was  --  " " Of course not . " " He 's being followed , Frank . Out in Colorado , he 's under someone 's surveillance . " " Not ours . " Eight hundred ninety-five feet due north of the sterile house on the waters of Chesapeake Bay was the estate of Dr. Samuel Winters , honored historianand for over forty years friend and adviser to presidents of the United States . In his younger days the immensely wealthy academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skiing and sailing lined the shelves of his private study , attesting to his former skills . Now there remained for the aging educator a more passive game that had been a minor passion with the Winters family for generations , initially making its appearance on the lawn of their mansion in Oyster Bay during the early twenties . The game was croquet , and whenever any member of the family built on new property , among the first considerations was a proper lawn for the very official course that never deviated from the 40- by 75-foot dimensions as prescribed by the National Croquet Association in 1882 . So one of the sights that caught the eye of a visitor to Dr. Winters 's estate was the croquet " field " to the right of the enormous house above the waters of the Chesapeake . Its charm was enhanced by the many pieces of white wrought-iron furniture that bordered the course , areas of respite for those studying their next moves or having a drink . The scene was identical with the croquet course at the sterile house 895 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only fitting that it should be , for all the land upon which both mansions stood originally belonged to Samuel Winters . Five years ago  --  with the silent resurrectionp345of Inver Brass  --  Dr. Winters had quietly donated the south estate to the United States government for use as a " safe , " or " sterile , " house . In order to deter the amiably curious and divert hostile probes by potential enemies of the United States , the transaction was never revealed . According to the property records filed in the Town Hall of Cynwid Hollow , the house and grounds still belonged to Samuel and Martha Jennifer Winters ( the latter deceased ) , and for which the family 's accountants annually paid the inordinatelyhigh shoreline taxes , refunded secretly by a grateful government . If any of the curious , friendly or unfriendly alike , inquired into the activity at this aristocratic compound , they were invariably told that it never stopped , that limousines and caterers carried and cared for the great and the near great of the academic world and industry , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strong young gardeners kept the place trim to a fare-thee-well , and served also as staff , seeing to the needs of the constant stream of visitors . The image conveyed was that of a multimillionaire 's multipurpose think tank in the countryside  --  far too open to be anything but what it purported to be . To maintain the integrity of that image , all bills were sent to Samuel Winters 's accountants , who promptly paid them with duplicates of these payments forwarded to the historian 's personal lawyer , who , in turn , had them hand-delivered to the Department of State for covert reimbursement . It was a simple arrangement and beneficial to all concerned , as simple and as beneficial as it was for Dr. Winters to suggest to President Langford Jennings that Congressman Evan Kendrick might simply benefitby a few days out of the media limelight at the " safe house " south of his property , since there was no activity there at the time . The Presidentgratefully concurred ; he would have Herb Dennison take care of the arrangements . Milos Varak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the electronic console on the table in front of him . He swung his chair to the left , snapped a switch on the nearby wall , and instantly heard the quiet gears that lowered the directional dish on the roof . He then got out of the chair and wandered aimlessly around the sophisticated communications equipment in the soundproof studio in the cellars of Samuel Winters 's house . He was alarmed . What he had overheardon the telephone intercept from the sterile house was beyond his understanding . As the State Department 's Swann so unequivocally confirmed , no one in the Washington intelligence community was aware of Emmanuelp346Weingrass . They had no idea that " the old Arab " who had flown back from Bahrain with Evan Kendrick was Weingrass . In Swann 's words , his " thank you " to Evan Kendrick for the Congressman 's efforts in Oman was to get Weingrass secretly out of Bahrain and with equal secrecy into the United States by using a disguise and a cover . The man and the cover had bureaucratically disappeared ; Weingrass was virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mandatory because of Weingrass 's Mossad connection , a deception thoroughly understood by Kendrick . In point of fact , the Congressman himself had taken extreme measures to conceal the presence and the identity of his elderly friend . Milos had learned that the old man had been entered into the hospital under the name of Manfred Weinstein , and put in a room in a private wing with its own secluded entrance , and that upon release he had been flown to Colorado in a private jet to Mesa Verde . Everything was private ; Weingrass 's name was never recorded anywhere . And during the months of his convalescence the irascible architect only infrequently left the house and never to places where the Congressmanwas known . Damn ! thought Varak . Except for Kendrick 's close personal circle that excluded everyone but a trusted secretary , her husband , an Arab couple in Virginia and three overpaid nurses whose generoussalaries included total confidentiality , Emmanuel Weingrass did not exist ! Varak walked back to the console table , disengaged the Record button , rewound the tape , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can assume that no one in Washington intelligence circles knows that Weingrass was involved in Oman ? Absolutely . Forget Masqat , he 's a nonperson . He 's just not among the living over here . Dennison did n't even know who he wasOf course not . He 's being followed , Frank . Out in Colorado , he 's under someone 's surveillance . Not ours . " Not ours ... " Whose ? That question was what alarmed Varak . The only people who knew that there was an Emmanuel Weingrass , who had been told how much thatp347old man meant to Evan Kendrick , were the five members of Inver Brass . Could one of them  --  ? Milos did not want to think anymore . At the moment it was too painful for him . Adrienne Rashad was snapped awake by the sudden turbulence encoun- tered by the military aircraft . She looked across the aisle in the dimly lit cabin with its less-than-first-class accommodations . The attache from the embassy in Cairo was obviously upset  --  afraid , to be precise . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comforting friend , specifically an outsized leather-bound flask , which he literally ripped out of his briefcase and drank from until he was aware that his " cargo " was looking at him . Sheepishly he held up the flask toward her . She shook her head and spoke over the sound of the jet engines . " Just potholes , " she said . " Hey , pals ! " cried the voice of the pilot over the intercom . " Sorry about the potholes but I 'm afraid this weather 's unavoidable for about another thirty minutes or so . We have to stick to our channel and away from commercial routes . You should have flown the friendly skies , buddies . Hang on ! " The attache drank once again from the flask , this time longer and more fully than before . Adrienne turned away , the Arab in her telling her not to observe a man 's fear , the Western woman in her makeup saying that as an experienced military flier she should allay her companion 's fear . The synthesis in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to her thoughts that had been broken off by sleep . Why had she been so peremptorily ordered back to Washington ? If there were new instructions so delicate that they could not be put on scramblers , why had n't Mitchell Payton called her with at least a clue ? It was n't like " Uncle Mitch " to permit any interference with her work unless he told her something about it . Even with the Oman mess a year ago , and if ever there was a priority situation that was it , Mitch had sent sealed instructions to her by diplomatic courier telling her without expa- nation to cooperate with the State Department 's Consular Operations no matter how offended she might be . She had , and it had offended her , indeed . Now out of the blue she had been ordered back to the States , virtually incommunicado , without a single word from Mitchell Payton . Congressman Evan Kendrick . For the past eighteen hours his name had rolled across the world like the sound of approaching thunder . One couldp348almost see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American , looking up at the sky wondering if they should run for cover , run for their lives , under the threat of the impending storm . There would be vendettas against those who had aided the interfering man from the West . She wondered who had leaked the story  --  no , " leaked " was too innocuous a word  --  who had exploded the story ! The Cairo papers were filled with it , and a quick check confirmed that throughout the Middle East Evan Kendrick was either a holy saint or a hideous sinner . Canonizationor an agonizing death was awaiting him depending upon where those judging him were , even within the same country . Why ? Was it Kendrick himself who had done this ? Had this vulnerable man , this improbable politician who had risked his life to avenge a terrible crime decided after a year of humility and self-denial to strike out for a political prize ? If so , it was not the man she had known so briefly yet so intimately a year ago . With reservations but not regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenetically , perhaps inevitably under the circumstances  --  but those transient moments of splendid comfort were to be forgotten . If she had been brought back to Washington because of a suddenly ambitious congressman , they had never existed.  |p349Kendrick  stood by the windows overlooking the wide circular drive in front of the sterile house . Dennison had called him well over an hour ago with word that the plane from Cairo had landed and the Rashad woman had been taken to a waiting government car ; she was on her way to Cynwid Hollow under escort . The chief of staff wanted Evan to know that the CIA case officer had strenuously objected when she was not permitted to make a telephone call from Andrews Air Force Base . " She kicked up a stink and refused to get in the car , " Dennison had complained . " She said she had n't heard directly from her superiors and the Air Force could go pound sand . Goddamned bitch ! I was on my way to work and they reached me on the limo phone . You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' That 's what she said to me ! Then to twist the knife , she holds the phone away and asks out loud , What 's a Denni- son ? ' " " It 's that modest low profile you keep , Herb . Did anybody tell her ? ' " The bastards laughed ! That 's when I told her she was under the President 's orders and she either got in that car or she could spend five years in Leavenworth . " " It 's a men 's prison . " " I know that.Heh ! She 'll he there in an hour or so . Remember , if she 's the sieve I get her "  |  " Maybe . " " I 'll get a presidential order ! " " And I 'll read it on the nightly news . With footnotes . " " Shit ! " Kendrick started to leave the window for another cup of coffee when a nondescript gray sedan appeared at the base of the circular drive . It swept around the curve and stopped in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the far backseat . He walked rapidly around the trunk and opened the curbside door for his official passenger . The woman Evan had known as Khalehla emerged into the morning sunlight , squinting at the brightness , disturbed and unsure . She was hatless , her dark hair hanging to her shoulders over a white jacket above green slacks and low-heeled shoes . Under her right arm she clenched a large white handbag . As Kendrick watched her the memory of that late afternoon in Bahrain came back to him . He recalled the shock he had felt when she walked through the door of the bizarre royal bedroom bemused that he had raced back for the cover of the bed sheet . And how , despite his panic , bewilderment and pain  --  or perhaps adding to all three  --  he had been struck by the cool loveliness of her sharply defined Euro-Arabian face and the glare of intelligence in her eyes . He had been right ; she was a striking woman who carried herself erect , almost defiantly , even now as she walked toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be faced with the unknown . Kendrickobserved her dispassionately ; there was no rush of remembered warmth in his reaction to her  --  only cold , intense curiosity . She had lied to him that late afternoon in Bahrain , lied both by what she said and what she did not say . He wondered if she would lie to him again . The Air Force major opened the door of the enormous living room for Adrienne Rashad . She walked in and stopped , standing motionless , staring at Evan by the window . There was no astonishment in her eyes , just that frigid glare of intellect . " I 'll be going , " said the Air Force officer . " Thank you , Major . " The door closed and Kendrick stepped forward . " Hello , Khalehla . It was Khalehla , was n't it ? " " Whatever you say , " she replied calmly . " But then it is n't Khalehla , is it ? It 's Adrienne  --  Adrienne Rashad . " " Whatever you say , " she repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " And all this is very stupid , Congressman . Did you have nee flown back here to give you another testimonial ? Because if you did , I wo n't do it . " " Testimonial ? That 's the last thing I want . "  | " Good , I 'm glad for you . I 'm sure the representative from Colorado has all the endorsements he needs . So there 's no need for someone whose life and the lives of a great many colleagues depend on anonymity to step forward and add to your swelling cheers . " " That 's what you think ? I want endorsements , cheers ? " " What am I to think ? That you took me away from my work , exposed me to the embassy and the Air Force , probably crippled a cover I 've developed over the past several years just because I went to bed with you ? It happened once , but I assure you it will never happen again . " " Hey , wait a minute , bright lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast action . For Christ 's sake , I did n't know where I was or what had happened , or what would happen next . I was scared stiff , and knew I had things to do that I did n't think I could do . " " You were also exhausted , " added Adrienne Rashad . " I was , too . It happens . " " That 's what Swann said  --  " " That bastard . " " No , hold it . Frank Swann 's not a bastard  --  " " Shall I use another word ? Like pimp ? An unconscionable pimp . " " You 're wrong . I do n't know what your business was with him but he had a job to do . " " Like sacrificing you ? " " Maybe . . . . I admit the thought 's not too attractive , but he was pretty well boxed in then . " " Forget it , Congressman . Why am I here ? " " Because I have to learn something , and you 're the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " " Who broke the story on me ? Who violated the agreement I made ? I was told that those who knew I went to Oman  --  and they were damn few , a tight little circle they called it  --  none of them would have any reason to do it and every reason in the world not to . Outside of Swann and his computer chief , whom he swears by , there were only seven other people in the entire government who knew . Six have been checked out , all absolutely negative . You 're the seventh , the only one left . " Adrienne Rashad stood motionless , her face passive , her eyes furious . You ignorant , arrogant amateur , " she said slowly , her voice acid . " You can call inc any goddamned names you like , " began Evan angrily , " but I 'm going to  --  " " 1hn ' we go for a walk , Congressman ? " broke in the woman fromp352Cairo , crossing to a large bay window on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky shoreline of the Chesapeake . " What ? " " The air in here is as oppressive as the company . I 'd like to take a walk , please . " Rashad raised her hand and pointed outside ; she then nodded her head twice as if reinforcing a command . " All right , " mumbled Kendrick , bewildered . " There 's a side entrance back there . " " I see it , " said Adrienne-Khalehla , starting for the door at the rear of the room . They walked outside onto a flagstone patio that joined a manicuredlawn and a path leading down to the dock . If there had been boats lashed to the pilings or secured to the empty moorings bouncing on the water beyond , they had been removed for the autumn winds . " Keep up your harangue , Congressman , " continued the undercover case officer for the CIA . " You should n't be deprived of that . " " Just hold it , Miss Rashad or whatever the hell your name is ! " Evan stopped on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think what I 'm talking about amounts to a harangue , ' you 're sadly mistaken  --  " " For God 's sake , keep walking ! You 'll get all the conversation you want , more than you want , you damn fool . " The bay shore to the right of the dock was a mixture of dark sand and stones so common to the Chesapeake ; to the left was the boathouse , also common . What was not common , however , except to the larger estates , was a profusion of tall trees some fifty yards both north and south of the dock and the boathouse . They provided a measure of privacy , more in appearance than in reality , but the sight of them had appealed to the field agent from Cairo . She headed to the right , over the sand and the stones close to the gently lapping waves . They passed the border of trees and kept going until they reached a large rock that rose out of the ground by the water 's edge . Above , the immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Adrienne Rashad . " Do ? " exclaimed Kendrick . " What was that little exercise all about ? And while we 're at it let 's get a couple of things straight . I appreciate the fact that you probably saved my life  --  probably , not by any manner of means provable  --  but I do n't take orders from you , and in my considered opinion I 'm not a damn fool , and regardless of my amateur status you 're answering to me , I 'm not answering to you ! Check and double check , lady ? " " Arc you finished ? " " I have n't even begun . " " Then before you do , let me address the specifics you 've just raised.  |p353That  little exercise was to get us out of there . I presume you know it 's a safe house . " " Certainly . " " And that anything you say in every room , including the toilet and the shower , is recorded . " " Well , I knew the telephone was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have a damn thing to hide  --  " " Keep your voice down . Talk into the water as I am . " " What ? Why ? " " Electronic voice surveillance . The trees will distort sound because there 's no direct visual beams  --  " " What ? " " Lasers have improved the technology  --  " " What ? " " Shut up ! Whisper . " " I repeat , I have n't got a damn thing to hide . Maybe you do , but I do n't ! " " Really ? " asked Rashad , leaning against the huge rock and talking down into the small , slowly encroaching waves . " You want to involve Ahmat ? " " I 've mentioned him . To the President . He should know how much help that kid was  --  " " Oh , Ahmat will appreciate that . And his personal doctor ? And his two cousins who helped you and protected you ? And El-Baz , and the pilot who flew you to Bahrain ? . . . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never mentioned anyone specifically  --  " " Names are irrelevant . Functions are n't . " " For Christ 's sake , it was the President of the United States ! " " And contrary to rumors , he does communicate beyond a micro-phone ? " " Of course . " " Do you know who he talks to ? Do you know them personally ? Do you know how reliable they are in terms of maximum security ; does he ? Do you know the men who are on the listening devices up in that house ? " " Of course not . " " What about me ? I 'm a field officer with an acceptable cover in Cairo . Would you have talked about me ? " " I did , but only to Swann . " " I 'm not referring to what you did with someone in authority who knewp354everything because he was the control , I 'm talking about up there . If you started questioning me up in that house , might n't you have brought up any or all the people I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Amateur , is n't it conceivable that you might have mentioned the Mos-sad ? " Evan closed his eyes . " I might have , " he said softly , nodding . " If we 'd gotten into an argument . " " An argument was unavoidable , which is why I got us out and came down here . " " Everyone up there is on our side ! " protested Kendrick . " I 'm sure they are , " agreed Adrienne , " but we do n't know the strengths or the weaknesses of people we 've never met and ca n't see , do we ? " " You 're paranoid . " " It goes with the territory , Congressman . Furthermore , you are a damn fool , as I think I 've amply demonstrated by your lack of knowledge regarding safe houses . I 'll skip the question as to who gives orders to whom because it 's irrelevant , and go back to your first point . In all likelihood I did not save your life in Bahrain , but , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untenable position we and certain pilots call the point of no return . You were not expected to survive , Mr. Kendrick , and I did object to that . " " Why ? " " Because I cared . " " Because we  --  " " That , too , is irrelevant . You were a decent man trying to do a decent thing for which you were n't equipped . As it turned out , there were others who helped you far more than I ever could . I sat in Jimmy Grayson 's office and we were both relieved when we got word you were airborne out of Bahrain . " " Grayson ? He was one of the seven who knew I was there . " " Not until the last hours , he did n't , " said Rashad . " Even I would n't tell him . It had to come from Washington . " " In White House language , he was put on the spit yesterday morning . " " For what ? " " To see if he was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's even more stupid than thinking it was me . Grayson wants a directorship so badly he can taste it . Also , he does n't care to have his throat slit and his body mutilated any more than I do . " " You say those words very easily . They come quickly to you , maybe too quickly . " " About Jimmy ? "  | " No . About yourself . " " I see . " The woman who had called herself Khalehla moved away from the rock . " You think I 've rehearsed all this  --  with myself , of course , because I damn well could n't reach anyone else . And , of course , I 'm half Arab  --  " " You walked into the room up there as if you expected to see me . I was n't any surprise to you . " " I did , and you were n't . " " Why and why not ? On both counts ? " " Process of elimination , I suppose  --  and an arrangement , a man I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and a half , you 've been hot news throughout the Mediterranean , Congressman , and a lot of people are shaking , including myself . Not only for myself but for many others I used and misused to keep you in sight . Someone like me builds a network based on trust , and right now that trust , my most vital commodity , has been called into question . So you see , Mr. Kendrick , you 've wasted not only my time and my concentration but a great deal of the taxpayers ' money to bring me back here for a question any experienced intelligence officer could answer . " " You could have sold me , sold my name for a price . " " For what ? My life ? For the lives of those I used to track you , men who are important to me and the work I do  --  work I think has real value , which I tried to explain to you in Bahrain ? You really believe that ? " " Oh , Jesus , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and shaking his head . " Everything I wanted to do , everything I 'd planned , has been thrown out in the garbage . Ahmat does n't want to see me again , I ca n't go back  --  there or anywhere else in the Emirates or the gulfs . He 'll see to it . " " You wanted to go back ? " " More than anything . I wanted to take up my life again where I did my best work . But first I had to find and get rid of a son of a bitch who 'd crippled everything , killed for the sake of killing  --  so many . " " The Mandi , " interrupted Rashad , nodding . " Ahmat told me . You did it . Ahmat 's young and he 'll change . In time he 'll understand what you did for everyone over there and be grateful . . . . But you just answered a question . You see , I thought that you might have blown the story yourself , but you did n't , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind ! I 'm getting out of here in six months !

Someone 's trying to stop me , making me into something I 'm not . What the hell is happening to me ? " " Offhand I 'd say you were being exhumed . " " Being what ? By whom ? " " By someone who thinks you were slighted . Someone who believes you deserve public acclaim , prominence . " " Which I do n't want ! And the President is n't helping . He 's awarding me the Medal of Freedom next Tuesday in the goddamned Blue Room with the whole Marine Band ! I told him I did n't want it , and the son of a bitch said I had to show up because he refused to look like a ' chintzy bastard . ' What kind of reasoning is that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's walk , " she said quickly as two white-suited members of the staff appeared at the base of the dock . " Do n't look around . Be casual . We 'll just stroll down this poor excuse for a beach . " " May I talk ? " asked Kendrick as he fell in step . " Not anything germane . Wait till we get around the bend . " " Why ? Can they hear us ? " " Possibly . I 'm not really sure . " They followed the curve of the shoreline until the trees obscured the two men on the dock . " The Japanese have developed directional relays , although I 've never seen one , " continued Rashad aimlessly . Then she stopped again and looked up at Evan , her intelligent eyes questioning . " You spoke to Ahmat ? " she asked . " Yesterday . He told me to go to hell but not to go back to Oman . Ever . " " You understand that I 'll check with him , do n't you ? " Evan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , accusing him , checking up on him . " I do n't give a damn what you do , my only concern is what you may have done . You 're convincing , KhaIc:lAla  --  excuseme  --  Miss Rashad , and you may believe what you say , but the six men who knew about me had everything to lose and not a goddamnedthing to gain by saying that I was in Masqat last year . " " And I had nothing to lose but my life and the lives of those I 've cultivated throughout the sector , some of whom , incidentally , are very clear to me ? Get off your plug horse , Congressman , you look ridiculous . You 're not only an amateur , you 're insufferable . " " You know , it 's possible you could have made a mistake ! " cried Kendrick , exasperated . " I 'd almost be willing to give you the benefit of the doubt  --  I implied as much to Dennison and told him I would n't let him bang you for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " No , I meant it . You did save my life , and if you made a slip and dropped my name  --  " " Do n't compound your asininity , " Rashad broke in . " It 's far , far more likely that any five of the others might have made a slip like that than either Grayson or myself . We live in the field ; we do n't make that kind of mistake . " " Let 's walk , " said Evan  --  no guards in sight , only his doubts and his confusion forcing him to move . His problem was that he believed her believed what Manny Weingrass said about her : " . . . she had nothing to do with exposing you . . . . it would only add to her shame and further inflame the crazy world she lives in . " And when Kendrick protested that the others could n't have , Manny had added : " Then there are others beyond others . . . . " They came to a dirt path that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordering the estate . " Shall we explore ? ' asked Evan . " Why not ? " said Adrienne coldly . " Look , " he continued as they climbed the wooded slope side by side " say I believe you  --  " " Thank you so much . " " All right , I do believe you ! And because I do I 'm going to tell you something that only Swann and Dennison know ; the others do n't , at least I do n't think they do . " " Are you sure you should ? " " I need help and they ca n't help me . Maybe you can ; you were there  --  with me  --  and you know so many things I do n't know . How events are kept quiet , how secret information gets passed to those who should have it , procedures like that . " " I know some , not all by any means . I 'm based in Cairo , not here . But go ahead . " " Some time ago a man came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a great deal of information about me  --  Frank called it PD . " " Prior data , " said Rashad , interrupting . " It 's also called privileged detail , ' and usually comes from the vaults . " " Vaults ? What vaults ? " " It 's the vernacular for classified intelligence files . Go on . " " After impressing Frank , really impressing him , he came right out and made his point . He told Swann that he had concluded that I 'd been sent to Masqat by the State Department during the hostage crisis . " " What ? " She exploded , her hand on Kendrick 's arm . " Who was he ?  | " Nobody knows . No one can find him . The identity he used to get to Frank was false . " " Good Christ , " whispered Rashad as she looked up at the ascending path ; bright sunlight broke through the wall of trees above . " We 'll stay here for a moment , " she said quietly , urgently . " Sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path surrounded by thick trunks and foliage . " And . " pressed the woman from Cairo . " Well , Swann tried to throw him off ; he even showed him a note to the Secretary of State that we both mocked up rejecting me . Obviously the man did n't believe Frank and kept digging , deeper and deeper until he got it all . What came out yesterday morning was so accurate it could only have come from the Oman file  --  from the vaults , as you call them . " " I know that , " whispered Rashad , her anger indelibly mixed with fear . " My God , someone was reached ! " " One of the seven  --  six ? " he amended quickly . " Who were they ? I do n't mean Swann and his OHIO-Four computer man , but outside of Dennison , Grayson and me ? " " The secretaries of State and Defense , and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs . " " None of them could even be approached . " " What about the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's young . Frank swore by him , but that 's only his judgment . " " I doubt it . Frank Swann 's a bastard , but I do n't think he could be fooled that way . Someone like Bryce is the first person you 'd think of , and if he 's smart enough to run that kind of operation , he knows it . He also knows he could face thirty years in Leavenworth . " Evan smiled . " I understand Dennison threatened you with five years there . " " I told him it was a men 's prison , " said Adrienne , responding with a grin . " So did I , " said Kendrick , laughing . " So then I said if he had any more goodies in store for me , I would n't get in Cleopatra 's barge , never mind the government car . " " Why did you get in ? " " Sheer curiosity . It 's the only answer I can give you . " " I accept it .... So where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in . " " I do n't know . " Suddenly Rashad touched his arm again . " I 've got to ask you some questions , Evan  --  " " Evan ? Thank you . " " I 'm sorry . Congressman . That was a slip . "  | " Do n't be , please . I think we 're entitled to first names . " " Now you stop  --  " " But do you mind if I call you Khalehla ? I 'm more comfortable with it . " So am I. The Arab part of me has always resented the deniability of Adrienne . " " Ask your questions  --  Khalehla . " " All right . When did you decide to come to Masqat ? Considering the circumstances and what you were able to do , you were late getting there . ' Kendrick took a deep breath . " I 'd been riding the rapids in Arizona when I reached a base camp called Lava Falls and heard a radio for the first time in several weeks . I knew I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of those frantic sixteen hours going from a compara- tively primitive campsite in the mountains to the halls of the State Department and finally down to the sophisticated computer complex that was OHIO-Four-Zero . " That 's where Swann and I made our agreement and I was off and running . " " Let 's go back a minute , " said Khalehla , only at that moment taking her eyes off Kendrick 's face . " You hired a river plane to take you to Flagstaff , where you tried to charter a jet to D.C. , is that right ? " " Yes , but the charter desk said it was too late . " " You were anxious , " suggested the field agent . " Probably angry . You must have thrown your weight around a bit . A congressman from the great state of Colorado , et cetera . " " More than a bit  --  and lots more of the et cetera . " " You reached Phoenix and got the first commercial flight out . How did you pay for your ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Khalehla , " but you had no reason to think so . How did you know whom to reach at the State Department ? " " I did n't , but remember , I 'd worked in Oman and the Emirates for years , so I knew the sort of person I wanted to find . And since I had inherited an experienced D.C. secretary who has the instincts of an alley cat , I told her what to look for . I made it clear that it would undoubtedly be someone in State 's Consular Operations , Middle East , or Southwest Asia sections . Most Americans who 've worked over there are familiar with those people  --  frequently up to their teeth . " " So this secretary with the instincts of an alley cat began calling around asking questions . That must have raised a few eyebrows . Did she keep a list of whom she called ? " " I do n't know . I never asked her . Everything was kind of frantic andp360I kept in touch with her on one of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I landed she had narrowed the possibilitiesdown to four or five men , but only one was considered an expert on the Emirates and he was also a deputy director of Cons Op . Frank Swann . " " It would be interesting to know if your secretary did keep a list , " said Khalehla , arching her neck , thinking . " I 'll phone her . " " Not from here you wo n't . Besides , I 'm not finished . . . . So you went to State to find Swann , which means you checked in with security . " " Naturally . " " Did you check out ? " " Well , no , not actually , not at the lobby desk . Instead , I was taken down to the parking area and driven home in a State Department car . " " To your house ? " " Yes , I was on my way to Oman and had to get some things together  --  " " What about the driver ? " interrupted Khalehla . " Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he did say something that shook me up . I asked him if he wanted to come in for a snack or coffee while I packed , and he said , I might get shot if I got out of this car , ' or words to that effect . Then he added , You 're from OHIO-Four-Zero . ' " " Which means he was n't , " said Rashad quickly . " And you were in front of your house ? " " Yes . Then I stepped out and saw another car about a hundred feet behind us at the curb . It had to have been following us ; there are no other houses on that stretch of road . " " An armed escort . " Khalehla nodded . " Swann covered you from minute-oneand he was right . He did n't have the time or the resources to trace everything that had happened to you minus-one . " Evan was bewildered . " Would you mind explaining that ? " " Minus-one is before you reached Swann . An angry rich congressman using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting to Washington . He 's turned down , so he flies to Phoenix , where he no doubt insists on the first flight out and pays with a credit card , and starts calling his secretary , who has the instincts of an alley cat , telling her to find a man he does n't know but is sure exists at the Department of State . She makes her calls  --  frantically , I think you said  --  reaching a number of people who have to wonder why . She gets you a narrowed-down quorum  --  which means she 's reached a lot of her contacts who could give her the informationand who also had to wonder why , and you turn up at State demandingp361to see Frank Swann . Am I right ? In your state of mind , did you demand to see him ? " " Yes . I was given a runaround , told he was n't there , but I knew he was , my secretary had confirmed it . I guess I was pretty adamant . Finally , they let me go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him he made his decision to send you to Masqat . " " So ? " " That tight little circle you spoke of was n't very little or very tight , Evan . You did what anyone else would do under the circumstances  --  under the stress you felt . You left a number of impressions during that agitated journey from Lava Falls to Washington . You could easily he traced back through Phoenix to Flagstaff , your name and your loud insistence on fast transportation remembered by a lot of people , especially because of the time of night . Then you show up at the State Department , where you made more noises  --  incidentally , checking in with security but not checking out  --  until you were permitted to go up to Swann 's office . " " Yes , but  --  " " Let me finish , please , " interrupted Khalehla again . " You 'll understand , and I want us both to have the full picture . . . . You and Swami talk , make your agreement of anonymity , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first leg was made to your house with a driver who was not part of OHIO-Four-Zero any more than the guards in the lobby . The driver was simply assigned by a dispatcher and the guards on duty were merely doing their jobs . They 're not in the rarefied circles ; nobody up there brings them in on top-secret agendas . But they 're human ; they go home and talk to their wives and their friends because something different happened in their normally dull jobs . They might also answer questions casually put to them by people they thought were governmentbureaucrats . " " And one way or another they all knew who I was  --  " " As did a lot of other people in Phoenix and Flagstaff , and one thing was clear to all of them . This important man 's upset ; this congressman 's in a hell of a hurry ; this big shot 's got a problem . Do you see the trail you left ? " " Yes , I do , but who would look for it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I can tell you . " " Troubles you ? Whoever it was has blown my life apart ! Who would do it ? " " Someone who found an opening , a gap that led to the rest of the trail from a remote campsite called Lava halls to the terrorists in Masgatp362Someone who picked up on something that made him want to look further . Perhaps it was the calls your secretary made , or the commotion you caused at the State Department 's security desk , or even something as crazy as hearing the rumor that an unknown American had interceded in Oman  --  it was n't crazy at all ; it was printed and squashed  --  but it could have started somebody thinking . Then the other things fell in place and you were there . " Evan put his hand over hers . " I have to know who it was , Khalehla , I have to know . " " But we do know , " she said softly , correcting herself , her voice flat as if seeing something she should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent . " " Why ? " Kendrick removed his hand as the word exploded from his throat . Khalehla looked at him , her gaze compassionate , yet beneath her concernwas that cold analytical intelligence in her eyes . " The answer to that has to be your overriding concern , Evan , but I have another problem and it 's why I 'm frightened . " " I do n't understand . " " Whoever the blond man was , whomever he represents , he reached way down deep in our cellars and took out what he should never have been given . I 'm stunned , Evan , petrified , and those words are n't strong enough for the way I feel . Not only by what 's been done to you , but by what 's been done to us . We 've been compromised , penetrated where such penetrationshould have been impossible . If they  --  whoever they are  --  can dig you up out of the deepest , most secure archives we have , they can learn a lot of other things no one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cost a great many lives  --  very unpleasantly . " Kendrick studied her taut , striking face , seeing the fear in her eyes . " You mean that , do n't you ? You are frightened . " " So would you be if you knew the men and women who help us , who trust us , who risk their lives to bring us information . Every day they wonder if something they did or did n't do will trip them up . A lot of them have committed suicide because they could n't stand the strain , others have gone mad and disappeared into the deserts preferring to die at peace with their Allah than go on . But most do go on because they believe in us , believe that we 're fair and really want peace . They deal with gunwieldinglunatics at every turn , and as bad as things are , it 's only through them that they 're not worse , with a great deal more blood in the streets . . Yes , I 'm frightened because many of those people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thought of them being betrayed ,  |p363as  you were betrayed  --  and that 's what you were , Evan , betrayed  --  makes me want to crawl out on the sands and die like those we 've driven mad . Because someone way down deep is opening our most secret files to others outside . All he or she needed in your case was a name , your name , and people are afraid for their lives in Masqat and Bahrain . How many other names can be fed ? How many other secrets learned ? " Evan reached over , not covering her hand but now holding it , gripping it . " If you believe that , why do n't you help me ? " " Help you ? " " I have to know who 's doing this to me , and you have to know who 's over there , or down there , making it possible . I 'd say our objectives dovetail , would n't you ? I 've got Dennison in a vise he ca n't squirm out of , and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Actually , he 'd jump at the chance to find a leak ; it 's an obsession with him . " Khalehla frowned . " It does n't work that way . Besides , I 'd be out of my class . I 'm very good where I am , but out of my element , my Arab element , I 'm not first-rate . " " Number one , " countered Kendrick firmly . " I consider you first-rate because you saved my life and I consider my life relatively important . And two , as I mentioned , you have expertise in areas I know nothing about . Procedures . ' Covert avenues of referral '  --  I learned that one as a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence , but I have n't the vaguest idea what it means . Hell , lady , you even know what the ' cellars ' are , when I always thought they were the basements of a suburban development , which , thank God , I never had to build . Please , you said in Bahrain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help yourself . " Adrienne Rashad replied , her dark eyes searching his coldly . " I could help , but there might be times when you 'd have to do as I tell you . Could you do that ? " " I 'm not wild about jumping off bridges or tall buildings  --  " " It would be in the area of what you 'd say , and to certain people I 'd want you to say it . There might also be times when I would n't be able to explain things to you . Could you accept that ? " " Yes . Because I 've watched you , listened to you , and I trust you . " " Thank you . " She squeezed his hand and released it . " I 'd have to bring someone with me . " " Why ? " " First of all , it 's necessary . I 'd need a temporary transfer and he can get it for inc without giving an explanation  --  forget the White 1 louse , it'sp364too dangerous , too unstable . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach . " " Who is he ? " " Mitchell Payton . He 's director of Special Projects  --  that 's a euphemismfor Do n't ask . ' " " Can you trust him ? I mean totally , no doubts at all . " " No doubts at all . He processed me into the Agency . " " That 's not exactly a reason . " " The fact that I 've called him Uncle Mitch ' since I was six years old in Cairo is , however . He was a young operations officer posing as an instructor at the university . He became a friend of my parents  --  my father was a professor there and my mother 's an American from California ; so was Mitch . " " Will he give you a transfer ? " " Yes , of course . " " You 're sure of that ? " " He has no choice . I just told you , someone 's giving away a part of our soul that 's not for sale . It 's you this time . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payton was a trim sixty-three-year-old academic who had been suckered into the Central Intelligence Agency thirty-four years ago because he fit a description someone had given to the personnel procurementdivision at the time . That someone had disappeared into other endeavors and no job had been listed for Payton  --  only the requirements , marked urgent . However , by the time his prospective employers realized that they had no specific employment for the prospect it was too late . He had been signed up by the Agency 's aggressive recruiters in Los Angeles and sent to CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , for indoctrination . It was an embarrassing situation , as Dr. Payton , in a rush of personal and patriotic fervor , had submitted his resignation , effective immediately , to the State Board of Regents . It was an inauspicious beginning for a man whose career would develop so auspiciously . MJ , as he was called for as long as he could remember , had been a twenty-nine-year-old associate professor with a doctorate in Arabian Studiesfrom the University of California , where he subsequently taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the government who convinced him that his country urgently needed his talents . What the specifics entailed they were not at liberty , of course , to disclose , but insofar as t hey represented the most exciting sphere of government service , they assumed that the position was overseas , iii the area of hisp366expertise . The young bachelor had leaped at the opportunity , and when faced with perplexed superiors in Langley , who wondered what to do with him , he adamantly suggested that he had cut his ties in L.A. because he had at least assumed that he would be sent to Egypt . So he had been sent to Cairo ( We ca n't get enough observers in Egypt who understand the goddamned language ) . As an undergraduate he had studied American literature , chosen because Payton did not think there was a hell of a lot of it . It was for this reason that an employment agency in Rome , in reality a CIA subsidiary , had placed him at the Cairo University as an Arabicspeakinginstructor of American literature . There he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important part of his life . At Payton 's first faculty meeting he sat beside the renowned Professor Rashad , and in their preconference small talk he learned that Rashad had not only gone to graduate school in California but had married a classmate of MJ 's . A deep friendship blossomed , as did MJ 's reputation within the Central Intelligence Agency . Through talents he had no idea he possessed , and which at times actually frightened him , he discovered that he was an exceptionally convincing liar . They were days of turmoil , of rapidly shifting alliances that had to be monitored , the spreading American penetration kept out of sight . He was able , through his fluent Arabic and his understanding that people could be motivated with sympathetic words backed up with money , to organize various groups of opposing factions who reported on each other 's movements to him . In return , he provided funds for their causes  --  minor expenditures for the then sacrosanct CIA but major contributions to the zealots ' meager coffers . And through his efforts in Cairo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , typical of the old-school-tie network in D.C. 's intelligence community , if a good fellow did such a fine job where he was , forget the convergence of specific factors that made him good where he was and bring him back to Washington to see what he could do there . M.J. Payton was the exception in a long line of failures . He succeeded James Jesus Angleton , the Gray Fox of clandestine operations , as the director of Special Projects . And he never forgot what his friend Rashad told him when he reached his ascendancy . " You never could have made it , MJ , if you had married . You have the self-confidence of never having been manipulated . " Perhaps . Yet a test of manipulation had come full force to him when the headstrong daughter of his dear friends had arrived in Washington , as adamant as he had ever seen her . A terrible thing had happened in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and she was determined to devote her life  --  atp367least a part of her life  --  to lessening the fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . She never told " Uncle Mitch " what had happened to her  --  she did not have to , really  --  but she would not take no for an answer . She was qualified ; she was as fluent in English and French as she was in Arabic , and she was currently learning both Yiddish and Hebrew . He had suggested the Peace Corps and she had slammed her purse down on the floor in front of his desk . " No ! I 'm not a child , Uncle Mitch , and I do n't have those kinds of benevolent impulses . I 'm concerned only with where I come from , where I was born . If you wo n't use me , I 'll find others who will ! " " They could be the wrong others , Adrienne . " " Then stop me . Hire me ! " " I 'll have to talk to your parents  --  " " You ca n't ! He 's retired  --  they 're retired , and they live up north in Baltim-on-the-Sea . They 'd only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Find me translating jobs , or a floating consultant 's position with exporters  --  certainly you can do that ! Good God , Uncle Mitch , you were a small-time instructor at the university and we never said anything ! " " You did n't know , my dear  --  " " The hell I did n't ! The whispers around the house when a friend of Uncle Mitch 's was coming and how I had to stay in my room , and then one night when suddenly three men came , all wearing guns on their belts , which I 'd never seen  --  " " Those were emergencies . Your father understood . " " Then you understand me now , Uncle Mitch . I have to do this ! " " All right , " consented M.J. Payton . " But you understand me , young lady . You 'll be put through a concentrated course in Fairfax , Virginia , in a compound that 's not on any map . If you fail , I ca n't help you . " " Agreed , " had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bet ? " " Not with you , you young tigress . Come on , let 's go to lunch . You do n't drink , do you ? " " Not really . " " I do and I will , but I wo n't bet you . " And it was good for Payton 's wallet that he did not bet . Candidate No. 1344 finished the excruciating ten-week course in Fairfax , Virginia , at the head of her class . Women 's liberation be damned , she was better than twenty-six men . But then , her " Uncle Mitch " thought , she had a motive the others did not have : one half of her was Arab . All that was more than nine years ago . But now on this Friday afternoonp368nearly ten years later , Mitchell Jarvis Payton was appalled ! Field agent Adrienne Rashad , currently on duty in the West Mediterranean Sector , Cairo Post , had just called him from a pay telephone at the Hilton Hotel here in Washington ! What in the name of God was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her post ? All officers attached to Special Projects , especially this officer , had to have their orders cleared through him . It was incredible ! And the fact that she would not come out to Langley but , instead , insisted on meeting him at an out-of-the-way restaurant in Arlington did not calm MJ 's nerves . Especially after she said to him , " It 's absolutely vital that I do n't run into anyone I know , or who might know me , Uncle Mitch . " Beyond the ominous tone of her statement , she had not called him Uncle Mitch in years , not since she was in college . His unrelated " niece " was a troubled woman . Milos Varak got off the plane at Durango , Colorado , and walked across the terminal to the counter of the car rental agency . He produced a false driver 's license and a correspondingly false credit card , signed the lease agreement , accepted the keys and was directed to the lot where the car awaited him . In his briefcase was a detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders of the Mesa Verde National Park and the descriptions of hotels , motels , and restaurants , the majority of which were found in and around such cities as Cortez , Hesperus , Marvel and , farther east , Durango . The least detailed area was a dot called Mesa Verde itself ; the designation of " town " did not apply . It was a geographical location more in people 's minds than on the books ; a general store , a barbershop , a small outlying private airport and a cafe called Gee-Gee 's constituted its industry . One passed through Mesa Verde , one did not live there . It existed for the convenience of farmers , field hands , and those inveterate travelers who invariably got lost by taking the scenic routes to New Mexico and Arizona . The anomaly of the airport was for the benefit of those dozen or so privileged landowners who had built estates for themselves in the backcountry and simply wanted it . They rarely , if ever , saw the stretch of road with the general store , the barbershopand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Las Vegas and Beverly Hills  --  thus the airport . The exception here was CongressmanEvan Kendrick , who had surprisingly run for political office . He kid made the mistake of thinking that Mesa Verde could produce votes , which it would have done if the election had been held south of the Rio Grande . Varak , however , very much wanted to see that stretch of road the localsp369referred to as Mesa Verde , or just plain Verde , as Emmanuel Weingrass called it . He wanted to see how the men dressed , how they walked , what the stresses of field work had done to their bodies , their muscles , their posture . For the next twenty-four or , at most , forty-eight hours he would have to melt in . Milos had a job to do that in one sense saddened him beyond measuring the pain , but it was something he had to do . If there was a traitor to Inver Brass , within Inver Brass , Varak had to find him ... or her . After an hour and thirty-five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not go inside dressed as he was , so he parked the car , removed his jacket , and strolled into the general store across the street . " Ai n't seen you before , " said the elderly owner , turning his head as he stacked bags of rice on a shelf . " Always nice to see a new face . You headin ' for New Mex ? I 'll put you on the right road , no need to buy anythin ' . I keep tellin ' people that , but they always feel they got to part with cash when all they want is directions . " " You 're most kind , sir , " said Milos , " but I 'm afraid I must part with cash  --  not mine , of course , my employer 's . It 's most coincidental , but I 'm to purchase several bags of rice . It was omitted in the delivery from Denver . " " Oh , one of the biggies in the hills . Take what you like , son  --  for cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out . " " I would n't think of it , sir . " " Hey , you 're a foreign fella , ai n't cha ? " " Scandinavian , " replied Varak . " I 'm just temporary , filling in while the chauffeur is ill . " Milos picked up three bags of rice and carried them to the counter ; the owner followed toward the cash register . " Who you work for ? " " The Kendrick house , but he does n't know me  --  " " Hey , is n't that somethin ' about young Evan ? Our own congressman the heero of Oman ! I tell ya , makes a man stand tall , like the President says ! He come in here a couple a times  --  three , four maybe . Nicest fella you 'd want to meet ; real down-to-earth , you know what I mean ? " " I 'm afraid I 've never met him . " " Yeah , but if you 're out there at the house , you know of Manny , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I tell ya , that crazy Jewish fella is somethin ' else ! " " Ile certainly is . " " That 'll be six dollars and thirty-one cents , son . Skip the penny if you ai n't got it . "  | " I 'm sure I have  --  " Varak reached into his pocket . " Does Mr .. . Manny come in here often ? " " Some . Maybe two , three times a month . Drives with one of them nurses of his , then as soon as she turns her back , he splits over to GeeGee 's . He 's some fella . Here 's your change , son . " " Thank you . " Milos picked up the bags of rice and turned toward the door , but was suddenly stopped by the owner 's next words . " I figure those girls snitched on him , though , ' cause Evan must be gettin ' a little stricter lookin ' after his ol ' pal , but I guess you know that . " " Yes , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiling . " How did you find out ? " " Yesterday , " replied the owner . " What with all the fuss out at the house Manny got Jake 's cab to bring him down to Gee-Gee 's . I saw him , so I went to the door and shouted to him about how great the news was , y'know . He yelled back something like My sugar , ' or something , and went inside . That 's when I saw this other car comin ' real slow down the street with a guy talkin ' on a telephone  --  you know , one of them car telephones . He parked across from Gee-Gee 's and just stayed there watchin ' the door . Then later he was on that telephone again and a few minutes after that he got out and went into Gonzalez 's place . No one else had gone in , so that 's when I figured he was keepin ' tabs on Manny . " " I 'll tell them to be more careful , " said Milos , still smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same man , or one of them , what did he look like ? " " Oh , he was city , all right . Fancy duds and slick-down hair . " " Dark hair , then ? " " No , sorta reddish . " " Oh , him ? " said Varak convincingly . " Approximately my size . " " Nope , I 'd say a mite taller , maybe more than a mite : " " Yes , of course , " agreed the Czech . " I imagine we often think of ourselves as taller than we are . He 's somewhat slender , or perhaps it 's his height  --  " " That 's him , " broke in the owner . " Not much meat on his bones , not like you , no sirree . " " Then he was driving the brown Lincoln . " " Looked blue to me , and big , but I do n't know one car from another these days . All look the same , like unhappy bugs . " " Well , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more discreet . We would n't want Manny upset . " " Oh , do n't worry about me tellin ' him . Manny had a big operation , and if young Evan thinks he needs closer watchin ' , I 'm for it . I mean , ol '  |p371Manny  , he 's a pistol  --  Gee-Gee even waters his whisky when he can get away with it . " " Thank you again . I 'll inform the Congressman of your splendid coop-eration . " " Thought you did n't know him . " " When I meet him , sir . Good-bye . " Milos Varak started the rented car and drove down the stretch of road leaving behind the general store , the barber shop , and Gee-Gee 's cafe . A tall , slender man with neatly combed reddish hair and driving a large blue sedan . The hunt had begun . " I do n't believe it ! " whispered Mitchell Jarvis Payton . " Believe , MJ , " said Adrienne Rashad over the red-checkered tablecloth at the rear of the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Oman ? " " It was a Four-Zero operation out of State and liaisoned by Lester Crawford , who wanted a list of our best people with the widest range of contacts in the southwest basin . That 's all I knew . There may be others more qualified than you , but not where contacts are concerned . " " You had to assume the operation involved the hostages . " " Of course , we all did , and to tell you the truth I was torn . Your friendship with Ahmat and his wife was no secret to me , and I had to assume that others also knew . You see , I did n't want to submit your name to Les , but your past work with Projects called for it and your ties to the royal family demanded it . Also , I realized that if I left you out for personal reasons and you ever learned about it , you 'd have my head . " " I certainly would have . " " I 'll confess to a minor sin , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When it was all over , I walked into Crawford 's office and made it clear that I understood the rules but I had to know that you were all right . He looked up at me with those fish eyes of his and said you were back in Cairo . I think it bothered him even to tell me that . . . . And now you tell me that the whole damned operation was blown open by one of us ! A Four-Zero strategy ca n't be unsealed for years , often decades ! There are records going back to World War Two that wo n't see the light of day until the middle of the next century , if then . " " Who controls around the countrycontrolled by government custodians with armed guards and alarm systems so high-tech they reach instantly back to Washington , alerting usp372here , as well as the departments of State and Defense and the White House strategy rooms . Of course , for the past twenty years or so , with the proliferation of sophisticated computers , most are stored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a minimum of three intelligence services and the Oval Office . Where original documents are considered vital , they 're sealed and packed off . " Payton shrugged , his palms upturned . " Oblivion , my dear . It 's all foolproof , theftproof . " " It obviously is n't , " disagreed the field agent from Cairo . " It is , when those records reach the level of security controls , " counteredMJ . " So I think you 'd better tell me everything you know and everything the Congressman told you . Because if what you say is true , we 've got a bastard somewhere between the decision to go maximum and the data banks . " Adrienne Khalehla Rashad leaned back in the chair and began . She withheld nothing from her once and always Uncle Mitch , not even the sexual accident that had occurred in Bahrain . " I ca n't say I 'm sorry , professionally or otherwise , MJ . We were both stretched and scared and , frankly , he 's a hell of a decent man  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess . I reconfirmed it this morning in Maryland . " " In bed ? " " Good Lord , no . In what he said , what he 's reaching for . Why he did what he did , why he even became a congressman and now wants out , as I 've told you . I 'm sure he 's got warts all over him , but he 's also got a good anger . " I think I detect certain feelings in my niece ' that I 've wanted to see for a long , long time . " " Oh , they 're there , I 'd be a hypocrite to deny them , but I doubt that there 's anything permanent . In a way , we 're alike . I 'm projecting , but I think we 're both more consumed with what we have to do , as two separate people , than in what the other wants . Yet I like him , MJ , I really do like iiiin . He makes me laugh , and not just at him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Payton wistfully , his smile and his gentle frown even sadder than before . " I 've never found anyone who could genuinely make me laugh . . . not with her . Of course , it 's a flaw in my own makeup . I 'm too damned demanding , and worse off for it . " " You have no flaws , or warts , " insisted Rashad . " You 're my Uncle Mitch and I wo n't hear of it . " " Your father always made your mother laugh . I envied them at times , despite the problems they faced . He did make her laugh . " " It was a defense mechanism . Mother thought he could say divorce ' three times and she 'd have to split . "  | " Rubbish . He adored her . " Then as deftly as if they had not strayed from the Masqat crisis , Payton returned to it . " Why did Kendrick insist on anonymity in the first place ? I know you 've told me , but run it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious and you should n't be . It 's a perfectly logical explanation . He intended to go back and take up where he left off five  --  six years ago . He could n't do that with the baggage of Oman around his neck . He ca n't do it now because everyone wants his head , from the Palestinian fanatics to Ahmat and all those who helped him and are frightened to death that they 'll be exposed . What 's happened to him during the past two days proves that he was right . He wants to go back and now he ca n't . No one will let him . " Again Payton frowned , the sadness gone , replaced by a cold curiosity that bordered on doubt . " Yes , I understand that , my dear , but then you have only his word that he wanted to go back  --  wants to go back . " " I believe him , " said Rashad . " He may believe it himself , " offered the director of Special Projects . " Now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things through . " " That 's cryptic as hell , MJ . What do you mean ? " " It may be a minor point , but I think it 's worth considering . A man who wants to fade from Washington , really fade , and not open a law office or a public relations firm or some other such gratuity for the government service he sought , does n't usually do battle with Pentagon heavyweights in televised committee hearings , or go on a Sunday network program that reaches the broadest audience in the country , or hold a provocative personal press conference guaranteed to get wide exposure . Nor does he continue to be a bete noire on a select subcommittee for intelligence , asking hard questions that may not promote his name in the public eye but certainly circulates it around the capital . Taken collectively , those activities are n't the mark of a man anxious to leave the political arena or the rewards it can offer . There 's a certain inconsistency , would n't you say ? " Adrienne Rashad nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of even wanting another on-the-scene testimonial from me , and having a bad case of political ambition . He blew up , denying any such motives , insisting vehemently that he wanted only to get out of Washington . " Could these he his second thoughts ? " suggested Payton . " I ask it kindly because any sane person would have them . Say this very successful individual  --  and he 's nothing if not an individualist ; I 've seen that forp374myself  --  gets a touch of our Potomac virus and tells himself to go for it , use all the marbles he 's got , including what he did in Oman . Then he wakes up and thinks , My God , what have I done ? What am I doing here ? I do n't belong among these people ! . . . It would n't be the first time , you know . We 've lost a great many good men and women in this city who came to that same conclusion  --  they did n't belong here . Most are fiercely independent people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one field or another . Unless they want power for the sheer sake of a driving ego  --  which your instincts about Kendrick would seem to dismiss and I trust your instincts  --  these people have no patience with the mazes of endless debate and compromise that are the by-products of our system . Could our congressman be someone like that ? " " Offhand , I 'd say it 's his profile to a capital p , but again it 's only instinct . " " So is n't it possible that your attractive young man  --  " " Oh , come on , MJ , " interrupted Rashad . " That 's so antediluvian . " " I substitute it for a term I refuse to use with my niece . " " I accept your version of courtesy . " " Propriety , my dear . But is n't it possible that your friend woke up and said to himself , I 've made a terrible mistake making a hero out of myself and now I 've got to undo it ? " " It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he is . " " But you do see the inconsistency of his behavior , do n't you ? He 's acted one way and then claims to be the opposite . " " You 're saying that he 's protesting too much , and I 'm saying that he is n't because he 's not lying , either to himself or to me . " " I 'm exploring every avenue before we look for a bastard , who  --  if you 're right  --  was reached by another bastard , a blond-haired one . . . . Did Kendrick tell you why he publicly took on the Pentagon as well as the entire defense industry , to say nothing of his less public but well-circulated criticisms of our own intelligence services ? " " Because he was in a position to say those things and he thought they should he said . " " Just like that ? That 's his explanation ? " " Yes . " " But he had to seek the positions that gave him the opportunity to speak in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subcommittee for Intelligence ; they 're politically coveted chairs , to say the very least . For every one of those seats there are four hundred congressmen who 'd sell their wives for the assignments . They do n't justp375fall into a member 's lap , they have to be worked for , fought for . How does he explain that ? " " He ca n't . They just fell into his lap . And rather than fighting for them , he fought to stay off them . " " I beg your pardon ? " exclaimed M. J. Payton , astonished . " He said that if I did n't believe him I should go talk to his chief aide , who had to strong-arm him into taking the Partridge assignment , and then see the Speaker of the House himself and ask that conniving old Irish leprechaun what Evan told him to do with his subcommittee . He did n't want either job , but it was explained to him that if he did n't take them , he would n't have a damn thing to say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him ; it 's why he ran for office . He got rid of one party sleazeball and did n't want another taking his place . " Payton slowly leaned back in his chair , bringing his hand to his chin , his eyes narrowed . Over the years Adrienne Rashad had learned when to be silent and not interrupt her mentor 's thinking . She did both now , prepared for any of several responses but not the one she heard . " This is a different ball game , my dear . If I remember correctly , you told Kendrick that you thought he was being exhumed by someone who believed he deserved acclaim for what he did . It goes far deeper than that , I 'm afraid . Our congressman is being programmed . " " Good Lord , for what ? " " I do n't know , but I think we 'd better try to find out . Very quietly , very cautiously . We 're dealing with something rather extraordinary . " Varak saw the large dark blue sedan . It was parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest several hundred yards west of Kendrick 's house and it was empty . He had passed the Congressman 's impressive hedge-bound grounds , still under minor siege by a few obstinate , hopeful reporters with a camera crew , and intended to head north to a motel on the outskirts of Cortez . The sight of the blue vehicle , however , changed his mind . The Czech continued around the next bend and drove the car into a cluster of wild brush that fronted the trees . On the seat beside him was his attache case ; he opened it and took out the items he thought he might need , several imperative , several hopeful . He put them in his pockets , got out of the car , closed the door quietly , and walked around the curve and back to the blue sedan . He approached the far door nearest the woods and studied the vehicle for traps  --  trips that would set off an alarm if someone tampered with the lock , or with pressure on the doors ,  |p376or  even light beams that extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid objects breaking the beams . He found two out of three with one so serious that it told him something : there were secrets in that automobile far more valuable than clothes or jewelry or even confidential business papers . A row of tiny holes had been drilled and painted over along the lower frames of the windows ; they were jets that released a nonlethal vapor that would immobilize an intruderfor a considerable length of time . They had been conceived and perfected initially for diplomats in troubled countries where it was nearly as important to question assailants as to save lives . They could be set off by chauffeurs during an assault or by alarms when the car was unoccupied . They were now being marketed among the rich throughout the world , and it was said that the suppliers of the mechanisms could not keep up with the demand . Varak looked around and quickly walked to the rear of the sedan , reached into his pocket and dropped to the ground in the vicinity of the tail pipe . He crawled under the car and instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged , stood up and ran into the woods . The hunt had begun and the waiting began . Forty-one minutes later he saw a tall , slender figure walking down the road . The man was in a dark suit , his coat open , a vest showing ; his hair was neatly combed and more red than brown . Someone in charge , thought Milos , should be given a lesson in basic cosmetic tactics . One never permitted an employee to go out in the field with red hair ; it was simply foolish . The man proceeded to unlock first the right front door , then rounded the hood and unlocked the driver 's side . However , before openingit , he crouched out of sight where there was apparently a third release , stood back up and climbed inside . He started the car . The powerful engine coughed repeatedly , then suddenly there was a loud rattling from beneath the chassis and an expulsion of fumes followed by the sound of crashing metal . The muffler and the tail pipe had blown apart , accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile . Varak lowered himself , a handkerchief over his face , and waited for t be clouds to disappear , clinging to the trees as they rose to the sky . Slowly be stood up . The driver , a surgical mask on his face and a gun in his hand , also watched the rising clouds as he spun repeatedly around in the seat checkingevery direction for an assault . None came , and his confusion was obvious . He picked up the car telephone , then hesitated and Milos underst*xd . If the problem was a simple mechanical failure and he reached his controls , say thirty or three hundred or three thousand miles away , hep377would be severely criticized . He replaced the phone and put the car into gear ; the sound was so thunderous he stopped instantly . One did not call attention to such a vehicle anywhere , anytime ; one chose another alternative , like reaching a garage and being towed in for a simple exterior repair . And yet . . . ? So another period of waiting began . It lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was a professional . Apparently convinced that no attack was forthcoming , he cautiously got out of the car and walked to the rear . Gun in one hand , a flashlight in the other , he continued to look around in all directions as Varak crept silently forward in the brush . The redheaded surveillant suddenly crouched , throwing the beam of light into the undercarriage . Milos knew he had only seconds to reach the edge of the road before the man discovered the heat-expanding plastic inserted in the tail pipe or noticed the markinw on the muffler made by the small , diamond-edged knife-saw . The moment came as Varak briefly parted the foliage eight feet from the crouching . peering man . " Christ ! " exploded the slender , well-dressed redhead , leaping back spinning first to his right , then to his left , his automatic leveled , his bad now to Milos . The Czech raised a third item he had taken from hi : attache case ; it was a Co2-propelled dart gun . Once again he parted the leaves in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mark embedding itself in the back of the man 's neck . The red-haired surveillant whipped violently around , dropping the flashlight as he desperately trier to reach behind him and rip out the offending needle . The more frenzies his movements were , the more rapidly the blood rushed to his head rushing also the circulation of the serum . It took eight seconds ; the mat fell to the ground , struggling against the inevitable effects , finally lying immobile on the country road . Varak walked out of the woods and swiftly pulled the redhead back into them , then returned for the man 's gun am flashlight . He proceeded to search the man for undoubtedly false identifi cation cards . They were not false . The unconscious figure below him was a specia agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Among his ID papers wa the unit to which he had been assigned two months and ten days ago  --  one day after the meeting of Inver Brass at Cynwid Hollow , MarylandMilos removed the dart , carried the man out to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedan . He concealed the flashlight any the gun beneath the seat , closed the door , and walked back to his rente , car around the bend . I Ic had to find a telephone and reach a man at th Federal Bureau in Washington.  | " There 's no information on that unit , " said Varak 's contact at the FBI . " It came down through administration circles , its origin in California , in San Diego , I think . " " There 's no California White House now , " objected Milos . " But there 's another House , ' in case you 've forgotten . " " What ? " " Before I go on , Checkman , we 're going to need some data from you . It concerns an operation out of Prague that 's gathering fruit over here . It 's minor but irritating . Will you help us ? " " Certainly . I 'll find out whatever I can . Now , what is the house in San Diego , California , that can cause the Bureau to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It belongs to the Vice President of the United States . " It is agreed , then . Congressman Evan Kendrick will be the next Vice President of the United States . He will become President eleven months after the election of the incumbent . In silence , Varak hung up the phone.  |p379It  had been five weeks since the calamitous ceremony in the White House 's Blue Room , a calamity compounded by Ringmaster Dennison 's incessant attempts to focus everyone 's attention on the presenter of the Medal of Freedom award and not on the recipient . The conductor of the Marine Band had misread his instructions . Instead of playing a haunting pianissimo of " America the Beautiful " under the President 's peroration , he plunged into a fortissimo version of the " Stars and Stripes " march , all but drowning out the chief of state . It was only when Congressman Kendrick stepped up to receive the award and express his thanks that the band struck the chords of the song in a low , swelling pianissimo , adding emotional impact to the recipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to read the brief speech given to him by Dennison ten minutes before the ceremony , thus instead of extolling the President 's " secret but extraordinary assistance , " he thanked all those he could not mention by name for saving his life and bringing about the solution of the Masqat crisis . This particular moment was embarrassingly punctuated by a loud whispered " Shit ! " from the ranks of Langford Jennings 's aides on the platform . The final insult to the ringmaster was brought about solely by himself . During the short photo session where no questions were permitted because of antiterrorist strategics , I Icrbcrt Dennison absently withdrew ap380small bottle of Maalox from his pocket and drank from it . Suddenly cameras were aimed at him , strobes exploding , as the President of the United States turned and glared . It was too much for the acid-prone chief of staff . He spilled the chalk-white liquid over his dark suit jacket . At the end , Langford Jennings , his arm around Evan 's shoulders , had walked out of the room and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclaimed the President . " Except for a certainasshole who 's supposed to run these things . " " He has a lot of pressures on him , sir . I would n't be too harsh . " " On Herb ? " said Jennings quietly , confidentially . " And have to do what he does ? No way . . . . I gather he gave you something to read and you would n't do it . " " I 'm afraid he did and I would n't . " " Good . It would have looked like a damned cheap setup . Thanks , Evan , I appreciate it . " " You 're welcome , " said Kendrick to this large charismatic man who kept surprising him . The ensuing five weeks had been as Evan thought they would be . The media clamored for his attention . But he kept his word to Herbert Dennisonand would continue to keep it . He refused all interviews , claiming simply that to accept one he would feel obligated to accept all , and that would mean he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally , he continued to hold . The November election in Colorado 's Ninth District was merely a ritual ; under the circumstances the opposition could not even find a candidate . Yet in terms of the media , some were more succinct than others . " You big son of a bitch , " had teased the acerbic Ernest Foxley of the Foxley program . " I gave you your first break , your first decent exposure . " " I do n't think you understand , " Kendrick said . " I never wanted any breaks , any exposure . " After a pause the commentator replied . " You know what ? I believe you . Why is that ? " " Because I 'm telling you the truth and you 're good at what you do . " " Thank you , young man . I 'll pass the word and try to call off the hounds , but do n't give us any more surprises , okay ? " There were no surprises to give anyone , thought Kendrick angrily , driving through the Virginia countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become a virtual base of operations for Khalchla , the properly given a large measure of sophistication by way of the Central Intelligehce Agency 's Mitchell Payton . The director of SpecialProjects had first ordered the construction of a high brick wall thatp381fronted the grounds , admittance achieved through a wide white wrought- iron gate electronically operated . Surrounding the property an equally tall Cyclone fence was placed deep in the earth , the green metal so ' thick it would take an explosive , a blowtorch , or a furiously manipulated hacksaw to break through , the invading sounds heard easily by a unit of guards . Payton then had installed a continuously " swept " telephone in Evan 's study with extension lights in various other rooms that told whoever saw them to reach that instrument as quickly as possible . A communicating computer had been placed alongside the phone and was hooked up to a modem connecting it solely to the director 's private office . When he had information he wanted Khalehla or the Congressman to evaluate , it was immediately transmitted , all printouts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's publicly stated instructions , Special Projects had moved swiftly at the beginning and assumed responsibility for all security measures mounted to protect the hero of Oman fromterrorist reprisals . Kendrick was impressed , initially because of the securityrrangements . In the space of one hour after a presidential limousine haddriven him away from the estate in Maryland , Mitchell Payton had totalcontrol of his movements  --  in a sense , of his life . The communicationsequipment came later , quite a bit later , the delay due to Khalehla 's obstinacy . She had resisted the idea of moving into Kendrick 's house , but after eighteen days of hotel living and numerous awkward out-of-the-way meetings with Evan and her Uncle Mitch , the latter had put his footdown . " Damn it , my dear , there 's no way I can justify the cost of a safe house solely for one of my people , nor would I list the reason if I could , and I certainly ca n't install the equipment we need in a hotel . Also , I 've passed the official word from Cairo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't afford you in the sector any longer . So I really do n't think you have a choice . " " I 've been trying to convince her , " Kendrick had interrupted in the private room of a restaurant across the Maryland border . " If she 's worried about appearances , I 'll put it in the Congressional Record that my aunt 's in town . How about an older aunt with a face-lift ? " " Oh , you bloody fool . All right , I 'll do it . " " What equipment ? " Evan asked , turning to Payton . " What do you need ? " " Nothing you can buy , " answered the CIA director . " And items only we can install . " ' I'l-c next morning a telephone-repair truck had drawn up to the house . It was waved onto the grounds by the Agency patrols , and men in tele/phone-company uniforms went to work while over twenty stonemasons were completing the wall and ten others were finishing the impenetrable fence . Linemen climbed successive poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and sending a separate cable to Kendrick 's roof . Still others drove a second truck around the rear drive and into the attached garage where they uncrated the computer console and carried it into the downstairs study . Three hours and twenty minutes later , MitchellPayton 's equipment was in place and functioning . That afternoon Evan had picked up Khalehla in front of her hotel on Nebraska Avenue . " Hello there , Auntie ? " " I want a dead bolt on the guest room door , " she had replied , laughing as she threw her soft nylon bag into the rack behind the seat and climbed in . " Do n't bother , I never mess with older relatives . " " You already have , but not now . " She had turned to him , adding with gentle yet firm sincerity . " I mean that , Evan . This is n't Bahrain ; we 're in business together , not bed . Okay ? " " That 's why you would n't move in before ? " " Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kendrick had said after a few moments of silence in the traffic . " That 's part of it . " " Which leads me to a question I 've wanted to ask you but I thought you might take it the wrong way . " " Go ahead . " " When you walked into that house in Maryland last month , among the first things you mentioned was Bahrain . Yet later you told me the house was wired , that anything we said would be heard . Why did you say it then ? " " Because I wanted the subject dispensed with as rapidly and as thoroughly as possible . " " Meaning that others  --  people cleared to read the transcripts  --  would assume or suspect what happened . " " Yes , and I wanted my position clear , which was not supine . My fallowing statements were consistent . " " Case closed , " said Evan , heading into the Beltway toward Virginia . " Thanks . " " By the way , I 've told the Hassans all about you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait to meet you . " " They 're your couple from Dubai , are n't they ? " " Ear more than a couple . ' Old friends from long ago . "  | " I did n't mean it in a belittling sense . He 's a professor , is n't he ? " " With luck he 'll have a post at either Georgetown or Princeton next spring ; there was a little matter of papers that we 've managed to clear up . Incidentally , small world ' department , he reveres your father . He met him once in Cairo , so be prepared for a lot of reverence . " " That 'll pass quickly , " laughed Khalehla . " He 'll learn soon enough that I 'm neither in his or Dad 's league . " " You can use a computer , though , ca n't you ? " " Well , yes , I can . I frequently have to . " " I ca n't . Sabri 's wife , Kashi , ca n't , and certainly he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league . " " Flattery does n't suit you , Evan . Remember the dead bolt in the door . " They had arrived at the house , where Khalehla was warmly greeted by Kashi Hassan ; an instant friendship was formed , as was a tradition among Arabic women . " Where 's Sabri ? " Kendrick had asked . " I want him to meet Khalehla . " " He 's in your study , dear Evan . He 's instructing a gentleman from the Central Intelligence Agency how to operate the computer in case of an emergency . " It had been over three weeks since the Khalehla-Langley axis had been in full operation , and they were no closer to learning anything new than they were since the sterile house in Maryland . Scores of people who even might have had the slightest possible access to the Oman file were put under Payton 's intelligence microscopes . Every step in the maximum- classified procedure was studied for flaws in personnel ; none were found . The file itself was written by the State Department 's Frank Swann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics involving a single word processor , the typing done in shifts of a thousand words per typist with all proper names omitted , inserted later solely by Swann and Crawford . The decision to go to maximum classification was reached by overview a summary without details , but with the highest recommendations of the secretaries of State and Defense and the Joint Chiefs , as well as the Central Intelligence Agency . It was all accomplished without Kendrick 's name or the identities or nationalities of other individuals or military units ; the basic information had been submitted to the select committees of the Senate and the House for approval at the conclusion of the crisis fifteen months ago . Both congressional approvals were instantly forthcom- ing ; it was also assumed that the Washington Post press leak concerning an unknown American in Masqat had come from an indiscreet member of these committees.  |p384Who  ? How ? Why ? They were back where they had started from : by all the rules of logic and elimination , the Oman file was beyond reach , yet it had been stolen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced . " A hole in the system and we 're missing it . " " No kidding , " Kendrick had agreed . Payton 's decision regarding Evan 's sudden appointments to both the Partridge Committee and the Select Subcommittee for Intelligence had floored Kendrick . Neither the manipulative Partridge nor the equally manipulating Speaker of the House should be approached directly . Why not ? Evan had objected . If he was the one being programmed , he had every right to confront those who were willing accessories . " No , Congressman , " Payton had said . " If they were blackmailed into appointing you , you can be sure they 'll stonewall and send out alarms . Our blond European and whoever he works for will go further underground . We do n't stop them ; we simply ca n't find them . I remind you , it 's the why ' that concerns us . Why are you , a relatively apolitical freshman representative from an obscure district in Colorado , being pushed into the political center ? " " It 's died down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Khalehla had said . " Two cable networks did retrospectives on you last week . " " What ? " " I did n't tell you . There was no point . It would only have made you angry . Kendrick lowered the Mercedes 's window and stuck out his arm . The government mobile unit behind him was new and the turn in the country road ahead was halfway around a long wooden curve , the turn itself close to a blind one . He was warning his guards , and he supposed there was a minor irony in that . . . . His thoughts returned to the " lousy enigma , " as he and Khalehla had come to call the whole elusive mess that had screwed up his life . Mitch Payton  --  it was now " Mitch " and " Evan "  --  had driven over from Langley the other evening . " We 're working on something new , " the director of Special Projects had said in the study . " On the assumption that Swann 's European had to reach a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you , we 're assembling some data ourselves . It may offend you , but we , too , are going back over your life . " " How many years ? " " We picked you up when you were eighteen  --  the chances of anything before then having relevance is remote . "  | " Eighteen ? Christ , is n't anything sacred ? " " Do you want it to be ? If so , I 'll call it off . " " No , of course not . It 's just kind of a shock . You can get that sort of information ? " " It 's nowhere near as difficult as people think . Credit bureaus , personnelfiles and routine background checks do it all the time . " " What 's the point ? " " Several possibilities  --  realistically two , I suppose . As I mentioned , t lie first is our doggedly curious European . If we could put together a list of people he had to reach in order to learn about you , we 'd be closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's the linchpin . . . . The second possibility is something we have n't attempted . In trying to unearth the vanishing blond man and whoever 's behind him , we 've concentrated on the events in Oman and the file itself . We 've restricted our microscopes to government-oriented areas . " " Where else would we look ? " Kendrick had asked . " Your personal life , I 'm afraid . There could be something or someone in your own past , an event , or people that you knew , an incident perhaps that galvanized friends or conceivably enemies who wanted to advance your position  --  or conversely  --  make you a target . And make no mistake , Congressman , you are a potential target , nobody 's kidding about that " " But , MJ , " broke in Khalehla . " Even if we found people who either liked him or hated him , they 'd have to be Washington-connected . Mr. Jones from Ann Arbor , Michigan  --  friend or enemy  --  could n't just go to the max-classified data banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's a certain file I 'd like to have a copy of so I can mock up a fake memorandumfor the newspapers . ' I do n't understand . " " Neither do I , Adrienne  --  or should I call you ' Khalehla , ' which will take some getting used to . " " There 's no reason for you to call me Khalehla  --  " " Do n't interrupt , " said Evan , smiling . " Khalehla 's just fine , " he added . " Yes , well , I really do n't understand , " continued Payton . " But as I told you , there 's a hole in the system , a gap we 've missed , and we have to try everything . " " Then why not go after Partridge and the Speaker of the I Louse ? " pressed Kendrick . " If I could do what I did in Masqat , they ca n't he so tough to break down . " " Not yet , young man . The tinting is n't right , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . " " MJ means he 's working on both , " Khalehla had explainedp386Evan braked the Mercedes around the long curve in the Virginia woods and waited until he saw the mobile unit in his rearview mirror ; he then turned right into the pasture road that was the back way to his house . The guards would admit him . He wanted to hurry now ; it was why he had taken the shortcut . Khalehla had called him at the office and told him Mitchell Payton 's list had arrived over the computer printout . His past was about to be presented to him . Milos Varak walked down the boarded path toward the enormous beach fronting the Hotel del Coronado three miles over the bridge from San Diego . He had worked diligently for weeks to find a crack through which he could penetrate the ranks of the Vice President of the United States . Most of the time was spent in Washington ; the administration 's Secret Service was not easily invaded . Until he found a man , a dedicated man , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unacceptable avocation that if exposed would destroy his assets , as well as his career and undoubtedly his life . He was a well-compensated procurer for various high-ranking members of the government . He had been primed for his work by the elders of his " family , " who had spotted his potential and sent him to the finest parochial schools and through a major university  --  major but not rich , for that image would be incorrect . The elders wanted a well-groomed , fine-looking , upstanding young man placed in a position to dispense favors in return for certain accommodations . And what better favors were there than below a weak man 's belt , and how better to reach accommodations than the knowledge thereof . The elders were pleased , had been pleased for a number of years . This man came from the Mafia ; he was Mafia ; he served the Mafia . Varak approached the lone figure in a raincoat by the rocks of a jetty several hundred yards from the high , imposing Cyclone fence of the Naval Air Station . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milos pleasantly . " I thought you had an accent on the phone , " said the well-spoken , well-trained , dark-featured man . " Are you a redbird courier ? Because if you are , you 've reached the wrong swallow . " " A Communist ? I 'm the furthest thing from it . I 'm so American your consiglieri could present me to the Vatican . " " That 's insulting , to say nothing of being totally inaccurate . . . . You made several very stupid statements , so stupid that you provoked my curiosity , which is why I 'm here . " " For whatever reason , I 'm grateful that you are . "  | " The bottom line was pretty clear , " interrupted the Secret Service agent . " You threatened me , sir . " " I 'm sorry you were offended , I never meant to threaten you . I merely said that I was aware of certain additional services you provided -- - " " Stop being so polite  --  " " There 's no reason to be discourteous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand my position . " " You do n't have a position , " corrected the government man with emphasis : " Our records are unblemished , if you get my point . " The Czech shifted his feet in the sand and waited while the roar of a jet passing over from the Naval Air Station diminished in the sky . " Youi'te  --  saying that there are no records and your point is that you wo n't discuss anything concrete because you think I may be wearing a recording de vice . " Varak unbuttoned his jacket , separating it . " Be my guest , search me . Personally , I would n't care to have my voice on the same tape with yours . . . . Please , go ahead . I will , of course , remove my weapon and hold it in my hand , but I wo n't stop you . " The White House guardian was sullen , hesitant . " You 're too acconi modating , " he said , standing motionless . " On the other hand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardness if you 'd just read something I 've prepared for you . " The Czech released his jacket , reached into his pocket and pulled out scycnil sheets of folded paper . He snapped them open and handed them to the Secret Service agent . As the man read , his eyes narrowed and his lips parted , frozen into t h e start of a snarl ; in seconds a reasonably strong and attractive face hccan c ugly . " You 're a dead man , " he said quietly . " That could be shortsighted , do n't you think ? Because if I am , snick so are you . The capos would descend like a pack of wild dogs while the dons , drinking their fine red wine as if it were your blood , waited to hca of your very unpleasant death . Records ? What are those ? Names , dates , times , locations  --  and correspondingly , opposite each entry , the results of your sexual merchandise , or rather , blackmailed into being results . Bills amended , contracts awarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd say it 's quite a record . And where does it all lead back to ? Let me guess . The most unlikely source one can imagine . . . . An unpublished telephone number listed under a false panic and address but located in the apartment of a uuenibcr of the govern nnent 's Secret Service . " " ' I'hose girls arc dead .... The boys are dead  --  " " Do n't Manic them . They had no more of a choice than you do nowp388Believe me , it 's better to assist me than to oppose me . I have no interest in your extracurricular activities ; you provide a service that if you did n't somebody else would for roughly the same results . All I want from you is information , and in exchange I 'll burn every copy of those pages . Of course , you have only my word for it , but as I 'm likely to call upon your expertise again , I 'd be stupid to release them , and I assure you I 'm not stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , his voice barely audible . " Why throw a gun away when you can still use it . " " I 'm glad you understand my position . " " What sort of information are you looking for ? " " It 's innocuous , nothing that will upset you . Let 's start with the FBI unit that 's been assigned to the Vice President . Are n't you people doing your job ? Do you need a special task force from the Bureau ? " " It has n't anything to do with us . We 're in place for protection . They 're investigative . " " You ca n't protect unless you investigate . " " It 's different levels . We come up with something , we turn it over to the Bureau . " " What did you come up with that called for this unit ? " " We did n't , " answered the man . " A couple of months ago a series of threats were made against Viper and  --  " " Viper ? " " The Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " " It 's not in general use , either . Just among the detail . " " I see . Go on  --  These threats . Who made them ? " " That 's what the unit 's all about . They 're trying to find out because they 're still being made . " " How ? " " Phone calls , telegrams , paste-up letters  --  they come from different places , which keep the Feds in the air a lot tracing them down . " " Without success ? " " Not yet . " " Then they 're a roving task force , here one day , somewhere else the next . Are their movements coordinated from Washington ? " " When Viper 's there , sure . When he 's out here , it 's here , and when he 's on the road it 's wherever he 's at . The unit 's controlled by his personal staff ; otherwise too much time is wasted checking back and forth with D.C. " " You were out here five weeks ago , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We just got back ten days ago ; he spends a lot of time out here . As he likes to say , the President covers the East and he covers the West , and he 's got the better deal because he gets away froni Funny Town . " " That 's a foolish statement for a Vice President to make . " " That 's Viper , but that 's not to say he 's a fool . He 's not . " " Why do you call him Viper ? " " As long as you want it straight I guess we do n't like him , or the crowd he pals around with  --  especially out here . Those bastards treat us like Puerto Rican houseboys . The other afternoon one of them said to nic , Boy , get me another G and T. ' I told him I 'd better check with my superiors in the Secret Service to see if I was assigned to him . " " Were n't you afraid the Vice  --  Viper  --  might take offense ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fed unit , we only answer to his staff chief . " " Who 's he ? " " Not he , she . We 've got another code for her ; it 's not as good as Viper but it fits . We call her Dragon Bitch  --  Dame Bountiful in the logs , which she likes . " " Tell me about her , " said Varak , the antennae of an adult lifetime picking up a signal . " Her name 's Ardis Vanvlanderen , and she came on board about a year ago replacing a hell of a good man who was doing a hell of a good job So good he got a terrific offer from one of Viper 's friends . She 's iii her forties and one of those tough executive ladies who looks like she wants to cut your balls off when you go into her office just because you 're a male . " " An unattractive woman , then ? " " I would n't say that . She 's got a decent enough face and a foxy body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her unless you like the type . My guess is she screws by the numbers . " " Is she married ? " " There 's a gonzo who comes around saying he 's her husband , but nobody pays much attention to him . " " What does he do ? What 's his business ? " " He 's Palm Springs social set . Stocks and bonds when they do n't interfere with his golf , that 's the way I read him . " " ' That 's significant money . " " He 's a heavy contributor and never misses a superhash at the White House . You know the type  --  wavy white hair and a big gut with lots of shiny teeth in a tuxedo ; they always get their pictures taken dancing Ifp390he could read a whole book through in English , they 'd probably make him the ambassador to the Court of St. James  --  I take it back . With his money , half a book . " Varak studied the Secret Service guard . The man was obviously relieved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete than they had to be , bordering on the false confidentiality of gossip . " I wonder why someone like that would send his wife out to work , even if it is for the Vice President . " " I do n't think he has anything to say about it . You do n't send a sharp item like her anywhere she does n't want to go . Besides , one of the maids told us she was wife number three or four , so maybe Vanvlanderen learned to let ' em hang loose and do their thing . " " And you say she does it well ? " " Like I said , very sharp , very pro . Viper does n't make a move without her . " " What 's he like ? " " Viper ? " Suddenly another jet took off from the Naval Air Station , the roar of the engines thunderous . " Viper 's Viper , " said the Mafia plant when the earthshaking noise had vanished . " Orson Bollinger 's a party glad-hander with an insider 's grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on that does n't serve the boys in the back rooms of California because they take care of him . " " You 're very astute . " " I observe . " " You do a great deal more than that . Only I 'd suggest you be more cautious in the future . If I can find you , others might , too . " " How ? Goddamn you , how ? " " Diligence . And over the weeks watching for a mistake someone had to make . It could have been one of the others in your detail for something else  --  we 're all human ; none of us lives in a freezer  --  but it turned out to be you . You were tired , or perhaps you had that extra drink , or simply felt you were too secure . Regardless , you made a phone call to Brooklyn , New York , obviously not the way you were supposed to make it , not from an untraceable pay telephone . " " Frangie ! " whispered the capo supremo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ricci family in Brooklyn , inheritors of the Genovese interests . It was all I needed , amico . " " You foreign low-life son of a bitch ! " " Do n't waste obscenities on me .... One last question , and why not he civil ? " p 391 " What ? " cried the furious man from the Mafia , his black eyebrowsarched , his right hand instinctively reaching behind his jacket . " Stop ! " roared the Czech . " One inch more and you 're dead . " " Where 's your gun ? " choked the agent , without a breath . " I do n't need it , " replied Varak , his eyes boring in on his would-bekiller . " And I 'm sure you know that . " Slowly , the Secret Service man brought his right hand in front of hills . " One question , that 's all ! " he said , his animus reflected in his face . " You 've got one last question . " " This Ardis Vanvlanderen . How was her appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Words must have been said , reasons given . After all , you 're Bollinger 's personal security and you worked well with her predecessor . " " We 're his security , not corporate executives . Explanations were n't required . " " Nothing was said ? It 's an unusual position for a woman . " " Plenty was said so we would n't miss the point , but no explanation . Bollinger called everybody together and told us how pleased he was to announce the appointment of one of the most talented executives in the country , someone who was assuming the job at such personal sacrifice that we should all thank the powers that be for her patriotism . The her ' was the first inkling we had that it was a woman . " " Interesting phrase powers that be . ' " " He talks that way . " " And he does n't make a move without her . " " I do n't think he 'd dare . She 's heavy metal and she keeps the house in order . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind . . . . That 's all for now , amico . Please be so kind as to leave first , will you ? I 'll call you if I need you . " The mafioso , the hot , ancestral blood of the Mediterranean rushing tohis head , jabbed his index finger at the Czech and spoke in a hoarse voice . " You 'll stay out of my fucking life if you know what 's good for you . " " I hope to stay as far away from you as possible , Signor Mczzano  --  " " Do n't you call me a pimp ! " " I 'll call you anything I like , but as to what 's good for me , I 'll be the judge of that . Now fila ! Capisce ? " Milos Varak watched his reluctant informer walk over the sand in silent fury until the rnezzano disappeared into the maze of beach accesses toward the hotel . ' I ' lie Czech let his mind wander . , she came on boardp392about a year ago ; he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without her . It was thirteen months ago when Inver Brass had begun the search for a new Vice President of the United States , the incumbent considered a pawn of the President 's unseen contributors  --  men who intended to run the country . It was past four o'clock in the morning and Khalehla would not stop . She kept pressing Evan , changing cassettes on the recorder and repeating names over and over again , insisting that wherever he recognized anything at all he describe in detail everything he could remember . The computer printout from Mitchell Payton 's office at the Central Intelligence Agency included a hundred twenty-seven selected names with corresponding occupations , marriages , divorces and deaths . In each case the individual listed had either spent considerable time with Kendrick or had been present during a period of high activity and could conceivably have been instrumental in his academic or career decisions . " Where the hell did he get these people ? " asked Evan , pacing the study . " I swear I do n't remember half of them , and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll always remember , and none of them could be remotely connected with what 's happening . Christ , I had three roommates in college , two others in graduate school and a sixth shared an apartment with me in Detroit when I worked in a lousy job over here . Later there were at least two dozen others I tried unsuccessfully to raise backing from for the Middle East and some of them are on that list  --  why I do n't know , but I do know all those lives are being lived in the suburbs with green lawns and country clubs and colleges they can barely afford for their kids . They have nothing to do with now . " " Then let 's go over the Kendrick Group again  --  " " There is no Kendrick Group , " broke in Evan angrily . " They were killed , blown away , drowned in concrete ! . . . Manny and I are all that 's left , you know that . " " I 'm sorry , " said Khalehla gently , sitting on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of her . " I meant the dealings you had over here in the States while there was the Kendrick Group . " " We 've gone over them . There were n't that many  --  mostly in hightechequipment . " " Let 's go over them again . " " It 's a waste of time but go ahead . " " Sonar Electronics , Palo Alto , California , ' " read Khalehla , her hand on the printout .  --  Hie representative was a nian named Carew  --  "  | " Screw Carew , ' " said Kendrick , chuckling . " That was Manny 's comment . We bought some sounding devices that did n't work , and they still wanted payment after we sent them back . " " Drucker Graphics , Boston , ' the representative , a G. R. Shulman . Anything ? " " Gerry Shulman , good man , good service ; we worked with them for years . Never a problem . " " Morseland Oil , Tulsa . ' The rep was someone named Arnold Stan-hope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me again . " " We did preliminary surveying for them in the Emirates . They kept wanting more than they were willing to pay for , and since we were growing , we could afford to drop them . " " Was there acrimony ? " " Sure , there always is when chiselers find out they ca n't do business as usual . But there was n't anything silence could n't cure . Besides , they found some other jokers , a Greek outfit who caught on to them and delivered a survey that must have been made on the floor of the Oman Gulf . " " Freebooters , every one of you , " said Khalehla , smiling and lowering her hand on the printout . " Off Shore Investments , Limited , headquartersNassau , the Bahamas , contact Ardis Montreaux , New York City . ' They funneled a lot of capital to you  --  " " Which we never touched because it was a sham , " interrupted Evan sharply . " It better damn well say that there . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I wrote it . It 's what you said before , Skip it . ' What 's Off Shore Investments , Limited ? " " Was , " corrected Kendrick . " It was a high-class boilerplate operation on the international scale  --  high-class and international but still boilerplate . Build a company up with large Swiss accounts and hot air , then sell off and switch the assets , leaving the buyers with a balloon full of helium . " " You got mixed up with something like that ? " " I did n't know it was something like that . I was a lot younger and impressed as hell that they wanted to list us as part of their structure ... even more impressed with the money they banked for us in Zurich . Impressed , that is , until Manny said ' bet 's try to get sonic , just for the hell of it . ' Ile knew exactly what he was doing ; we could n't pull gilt two francs . Off Shore 's signatures controlled all withdrawals , ; Ill assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " That 's it . " " How did you get involved ? " " We were in Riyadh , and Montreaux flew over and conned me . Ihad n't learned that there were n't any shortcuts  --  not that kind . " " Ardis Montreaux . Ardis . . . . That 's an odd name for a man . " " Because it 's not a man  --  she 's not a man . She 's a lot tougher . " " A woman ? " " Believe it . " " With your innate skepticism she must have been very persuasive . " " She had the words . She also wanted our heads when we pulled out ; she claimed we were costing them millions . Weingrass asked her whose millions this time . " " Perhaps we should  --  " " Skip it , " Evan broke in firmly . " She married an English banker and lives in London . She 's faded . " " How do you know ? " Showing minor embarrassment , Kendrick answered quickly and quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact to apologize . Skip it . " Sure . " Khalehla went on to the next firm on the printout . As she spoke she wrote two words after Off Shore Investments , Limited . Check out . Ardis Montreaux Frazier-Pyke Vanvlanderen , born Ardisolda Wojak in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , walked into the marble foyer of the suite at the Westlake Hotel in San Diego . She threw her sable stole over the back of a velour chair and raised her voice , her speech a cultivated mid-Atlantic , rather more nasal stage British than old-money American , but still afflicted with the harsh tones of Monongahela Slavic in the upper registers . " Andy-boy , I 'm home ! We 've got less than an hour to get up to La Jolla , so move it , sweetie ! " Andrew Vanvlanderen , heavyset , with stark white wavy hair and dressed in a tuxedo , walked out of the bedroom , a drink in his hand . " I 'm ahead of you , babe . " " I 'll be ready in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer mirror and fingering the curls of her perfectly coifed frosted brown hair . She was closing in on fifty and of medium height but gave the impression of being younger and taller due to erect posture , a slender figure topped by generousbreasts , and a well-coordinated face punctuated by large , penetrating green eyes . " Why not call for the car , sweetie ? "  | " The car can wait . So can La Jolla . We 've got to talk . " " Oh ? " The Vice President 's chief of staff looked over at her husband . " You sound serious . " " I am . I had a call from your old boyfriend . " " Which one , darling ? " " The only one who counts . " " Good God , he called here ? " " I told him to  --  " " That was dumb , Andy-boy , just plain dumb ! " Ardis Vanvlanderen walked rapidly , angrily out of the foyer and down into the sunken living room . She sat in a red silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes riveted on her husband . " Take risks with money  --  on commoditiesor futures or your stupid horses or any goddamned thing you like , but not where I 'm concerned ! Is that understood , darling ? " " Listen , bitch  --  Dragon Bitch  --  with what I 've paid out , if I want firsthand information I 'm going to get it . Is that understood ? " " All right , all right . Cool off , Andy . " " You start a rhubarb and then you tell me to cool it ? " " I 'm sorry . " Ardis arched her neck back into the chair , breathing audibly through her open mouth , her eyes briefly closed . In seconds she opened them , leveled her head , and continued . " Really , I 'm sorry . It 's been a particularly rotten Orson day . " " What 's Viper done now ? " asked Vanvlanderen , drinking . " Be careful with those names , " said his wife , laughing softly . " Wewould n't want our all-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's Bollinger 's problem ? " " He 's feeling insecure again . He wants a written ironclad guarantee that he 'll be on the ticket next July or we settle ten million on him in a Swiss account . " Vanvlanderen coughed a swallow of whisky into his glass . " Ten aril lion ? " he gasped . " Who the fuck does that comedian think he is ? " " The Vice President of the United States with a few secrets iii his skull , " replied Ardis . " I told him we would n't accept anyone else , but it was n't good enough . I think he senses that Jennings does n't consider hill ' a world-beater and would let him go . " " Our beloved telegenic wizard , Langford Jennings , has n't a goddamned thing to say about it ! . . . Is Orson right ? Does Jennings dislike him ? " " Dislike 's too strong . Ile just dismisses him , that 's what I hear from Dennison . " " Mat one 's got to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get mire curious than we want hint  --  "  | " Forget him , " interrupted Mrs. Vanvlanderen . " Forget Dennison and Bollinger and even your stupid horses . What did my straying , cat-hunting old boyfriend have to say that was so important you had him call here ? " " Relax . He phoned from my Washington attorney 's office ; we share the same firm there , remember ? But first , let 's not forget Orson . Give him his guarantee . A simple sentence or two and I 'll sign it . It 'll make him happy and happy is better . " " Are you crazy ? " cried Ardis , bouncing forward in the chair . " Not at all . To begin with , he 'll be on the ticket or he 'll just disappear ... like former vice presidents usually do . " " Oh , my , " said Ardis , drawing out the word my in admiration . " You 're my kind of fella , Andy-boy . You think so clearly , so succinctly . " " Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did mixed-up old Dimples have to say ? Who 's after his sensitive skin now ? " " Not his , ours  --  " " Which is his and do n't you forget it . It 's why I 'm here , lover , why he introduced us and brought us together . " " He wants us to know that the little group of deluded super people are moving into high gear . During the next three months their congressman will start getting editorials in progressively stronger papers . The theme will be examining his positions ' and he 'll pass all the exams . The point , of course , is to create a ground swell . Our Cupid is worried , very worried . And to tell you the truth I 'm sweating a few bullets myself . Those benevolent lunatics know what they 're doing ; this whole thing could get out of control . Ardis , we 've got millions riding on the next five years . I 'm goddamned worried ! " " Over nothing , " said his perfectly coiffed wife , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at Vanvlanderen , her wide green eyes only partially amused . " Since you figure to save ten million on Bollinger one way or another  --  and my way is better , certainly safer , than any alternative  --  I think it 's only reasonable that you bank an equal amount for me , do n't you , darling ? " " Somehow I fail to see the overpowering reason . " " It could be your undying love for me . . . or perhaps one of the more extraordinary coincidences of my career floating among the rich , the beautiful , the powerful and the politically ambitious , especially in the area of government largess . " " How 's that again ? " " I wo n't recite the litany of why we 're all doing what we 're doing , or even why I 've cast my not inconsiderable talents with you , but I will nowp397let you in on a little secret I 've kept all to myself for , lo , these many weeks . " " I 'm fascinated , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closely observing his fourth wife . " What is it ? " " I know Evan Kendrick . " " You what ? " " Our brief association goes back a number of years , more than I care to dwell on , frankly , but for a few weeks we had something in common . " " Outside of the obvious , what ? " " Oh , the sex was pleasant enough but immaterial . . . to both of us . We were young people in a hurry with no time for attachments . Do you remember Off Shore Investments ? " " If he was part of that outfit , we can nail him with fraud ! Certainly enough to take him out if he climbs on board . Was he ? " " He was , but you ca n't . He pulled out in loud moral indignation , which was the start of that house-of-cards ' collapse . And I would n't he too anxious to nail Off Shore 's principals unless you 're tired of me , sweetie . " " You ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the components . " " I 'll be damned . " Vanvlanderen laughed as he picked up his drink and raised the glass to his wife . " Those thieves sure as hell knew whom to hire for the right jobs . . . . Wait a minute . You knew Kendrick well enough to sleep with the son of a bitch and you never said anything ? " " I had my reasons  --  " " They better be damned good ! " exploded the President 's heavy con tributor . " Because if they 're not , I may just break your ass , you hitch ! Suppose he saw you , recognized you , remembered Off Shore and put two and two together and got four ! I do n't take those kinds of chances ! " " It 's my turn to say Relax , ' Andy , " countered the contributor 's wife . " The people around a vice president are n't news or even newsworthy . When 's the last time you can recall the name of any individual on a vice president 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have it any other way . Besides , I do n't think my name 's even been in the papers except as ' Mr. and Mrs. Vanvlanderen , guests at the White House . ' Kendrick still thinks I 'm Frazier-Pyke , a banker 's wife living in London , and if you remember , although both of us were invited to the Medal of Freedom ceremony , you went alone .

"  |p399Varak  studied the members of Inver Brass , each face around the table reflected in the light of the brass lamp in front of him  --  and her . The Czech 's concentration was strained to the limit because he had to focus on two levels . The first was the information he delivered ; the second was on the immediate reaction each had to certain facts within that information . I lc had to find one pair of eyes that were suspect and he could not find them . That was to say , there were no momentary flashes of astonishment or fear on the faces of the members as he gradually , logically approached the subject of the current Vice President of the United States and his staff , touching ever so lightly on the " innocuous " details he had learned from a Mafia plant in the Secret Service . There was nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction and conveyed roughly 8o percent of the truth , he kept watching their eyes , the second level of his mind recalling the salient facts of the life behind each face reflected in the light . And as he looked at each face , its features heightened by the chiaroscurowash from the lamps , he felt , as he always did , that he was iii the presence of giants . Yet one was not ; one had revealed the existence of Emmanuel Weingrass iii Mesa Verde , Colorado , a secret unknown to the most clandestine departments in Washington . One of those shadowed furs in front of him was a traitor to Inver Brass . Who ?  |p400Samuel  Winters ? Old money from an American dynasty going back to the railroad and oil barons of the late-nineteenth century . An honored scholar satisfied with his privileged life ; an adviser to presidents regardless of party . A great man at peace with himself . Or was he ? Jacob Mandel ? A venerated financial genius who had designed and implemented reforms that revitalized the Securities and Exchange Commissioninto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From Lower East Side Yiddish poverty to the halls of merchant princes , and it was said that no decent man who knew him could call him an enemy . Like Winters , he wore his honors well and there were few he had not attained . Or were there others he strove for secretly ? Margaret Lowell ? Again aristocratic old money from the New York  --  Palm Beach orbit , but with a twist that was virtually unheard of in those circles . She was a brilliant attorney who eschewed the rewards of estate and corporate law for the pursuit of advocacy . She worked feverishly in the legal vineyards on behalf of the oppressed , the dispossessed and the disfranchised . Both theorist and practitioner , she was rumored to be the next woman on the Supreme Court . Or was the advocacy a supreme cover for the championship of opposite causes under cover ? Eric Sundstrom ? The wunderkind scientist of earth and space technology , holder of over twenty hugely remunerative patents , of which the vast majority of proceeds were given away to engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a towering intellect concealed by a cherubic face with tousled red hair , an impish smile and a ready sense of humor  --  as if he were embarrassed by his gifts , even quick to feign mild offense if they were singled out . Or was it all pretense , the guilelessness a sham ? Gideon Logan ? Perhaps the most complex of the quintet , and because he was a black man , again perhaps , understandable . He had made several fortunes in real estate , never forgetting where he came from , hiring and nursing along black firms in his developments . It was said that he quietly did more for civil rights than any single corporation in the country . The current administration , as well as its predecessor , had offered him a variety of cabinet posts , all of which he refused , believing he could achieve more as a respected independent force in the private sector than if he was identified with a political party and its practices . A nonstop worker , he seemingly permitted himself only one indulgence : a luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing on his forty-six-foot Bertram with his wife of twelve years . Or was the legend that was Gideon Logan incomplete ? The answer was yes . Several years of his whirlwind , meteoric life were simply unknown ; it was as if he had not existed.  | " Milos ? " asked Margaret Lowell , her elbow forward on the table , her head resting on the extended fingers of her hand . " How in heaven 's name has the administration managed to keep the threats against Bollinger quiet ? Especially with a Bureau unit exclusively assigned to him . " Strike Margaret Lowell ? She was opening the obvious can of worms in which was found the Vice President 's chief of staff . " I must assume it 's through the direction of Mrs. Vanvlanderen , her executive expertise , as it were . " Watch the eyes . The muscles of their faces  --  the jaws .... Nothing . They reveal nothing ! Yet one of them knows ! Who ? " I realize she 's Andrew Vanvlanderen 's wife , " said Gideon Logan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one hell of a fund-raiser , but why was she appointed , to begin with ? " Strike Gideon Logan ? He was stirring up the worms . " Perhaps I can answer that , " replied Jacob Mandel . " Before she marriedVanvlanderen she was a headhunter 's dream . She turned around two companies that I know of from bankruptcy into profitable mergers . I 'm told she 's distastefully aggressive , but no one can deny her managerial talents . She 'd be good in that job ; she 'd keep the political sycophants at bay . Strike Jacob Mandel ? He had no compunction about praising her . " I ran across her once , " said Eric Sundstrom emphatically , " and in plain words she was a bitch . I assigned a patent to Johns Hopkins Medical and she wanted to broker the damn thing . " " What was there to broker ? " asked the attorney Lowell . " Absolutely nothing , " answered Sundstrom . " She tried to convince Inc that such large grants required an overseer to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for new jockstraps . " " She probably had a point , " said the lawyer , nodding as if from experience . " Not for me . Not the way she talked and the med school 's president 's a good friend of mine . She 'd have driven him up the wall so often he would have returned the patent . She 's a bitch , a real hitch . " Strike Eric Sundstrom ? He had no compunction whatsoever about damning her . " I never met her , " interjected Samuel Winters , " hut she was married to Emory Frazier-Dyke , a fine-tuned banker iii London . You remember Emory , do n't you , Jacob ? " " Certainly He played polo and you introduced inc as a silent branch of the Kotlischilds - which , unfortunately , I think he believed . "  | " Someone told me , " continued Winters , " that poor Frazier-Pyke lost a considerable amount of money in a venture she was associated with but came away with a wife . It was the Off Shore Investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added Mandel . " Goniffs , every one of them . He should have checked with his polo ponies or even the silent Rothschild . " " Perhaps he did . She did n't last long and old Emory has always been a stickler for the straight and narrow . She could have been a thief , too . " Strike Samuel Winters ? The traitor in Inver Brass would not raise the speculation . " In one way or another , " commented Varak without emphasis , " you are all at least aware of her , then . " " I was n't , " said Margaret Lowell , bordering on the defensive , " but after hearing the others I can tell you who else knows her  --  aware ' is a touch too dull . My ex-husband , the alley cat ; it was the Frazier-Pyke that did it . " " Walter ? " Sundstrom 's voice and expression were both humorously questioning . " My boy made so many business trips to London I thought he was advising the Crown , and he frequently mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning the maid phoned me at the office saying that Casanova had an urgent call from an ' FP ' in London , but she did n't know where he was . She gave me the number and I called saying to somebody  --  I assumed a secretary  --  that M. Lowell was on the line for ' FP . ' I was subsequently greeted by an exuberant voice virtually yelling at me . Dahling , I 'll be in New York tomorrow and we can have five full days together ! ' I said How nice ' and hung up . " " She travels in the right circles for her purposes , " said Gideon Logan , chuckling . " Andy-boy Vanvlanderen will keep her in blue chips and sables until he gets bored . " Varak had to change the subject quickly ! If he was right about there being a traitor around the table , and he was right  --  whatever was said about Ardis Vanvlanderen would get back to her and he could not permit anything further . " From everyone 's reactions , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are some opportunists who are immenselycapable . However , it 's not important . " Watch them . Every face . " She serves the Vice President well , but that 's essentially immaterial to us . . . . Back to our candidate , everything proceeds on schedule . The Midwest newspapers , starting with Chicago , will he the first to speculate on his credentials , both in columns and editorials . They 've all been providedwith extensive background material on Kendrick as well as tapes ofp403the Partridge Committee , the Foxley program and his own quite remark able press conference . From this core the word will spread both East and West . " " How were they approached , Milos ? " asked the spokesman , Sannlcl Winters . " The newspapers and the columnists , I mean . " " A legitimate ad hoc committee that we 've formed in Denver . ' flit seed , when planted , grew quickly . The Colorado branch of the party was enthusiastic , especially as the money was contributed by donors who insisted on remaining anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wherewithal to launch him , as well as t I is attention it focuses on Colorado . Win or lose , they ca n't lose . " " That wherewithal ' could be a legal problem , " said Margaret Lowell . " Nothing significant , madam . It 's provided in sequences , no amount over the legal limit as mandated by the election laws  --  which are quite obscure , if not mystifying , in my opinion . " " If I need a lawyer , I 'll call you , Milos , " added Lowell , smiling and sitting back in her chair . " I 've furnished each of you with a copy of the names of the newspapers , their editorial writers and the columnists involved in this phase  --  " " To be burned in our coal stove , " broke in Winters softly . " Of course , " " Naturally , " " Most certainly , " came the chorus of quiet replies . Which was the liar ? " Tell me , Varak , " said the brilliant cherubic Sundstrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've brought us , our candidate has n't displayed an iota of that fire in the belly ' we hear so much about . Is n't it terribly important ? Does n't he have to ultimately want the job ? " " He 'll want it , sir . As we 've learned , he 's what might be called a closet activist who runs out of the closet when the conditions call for his ahili ties . " Good Lord , Samuel , he 's a rabbi , too ? " " Hardly , Mr. Mandel , " replied the Czech , permitting himself a tight grin . " What I mean to say , no doubt poorly  --  " " The words are lovely , Milos . " " Thank you , sir , you 're too kind . But what I'nm trying to say is that on two dramatic occasions in his life  --  one extraordinarily dangerous to Iiini personally  --  he chose to take the most difficult courses of action because he felt he could effect a change for the better . The first was his decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , was ( ) 111.111 III short words , he nncst once again be convinced that his person and his abilities are needed uniquely needed for the good of the countiv " That 's a tall order , " said Gideon Logan . " He 's obviously a man of realistic sensibilities who makes a pretty fair appraisal of his qualifications . His bottom line may be . . . I 'm not qualified . ' How do we overcome that ? " Varak looked around the table , his expression that of a man trying to be understood . " I suggest symbolically , sir . " " How 's that ? " asked Mandel , removing his steel-rimmed glasses . " For example , the current Secretary of State , although he is frequently maligned by his colleagues and the White House staff as a stubborn academic , is the most reasoned voice in the administration . I know privatelythat he has managed to block a number of rash actions recommended by the President 's advisers because the President respects him  --  " " He damn well should , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance would fall apart without him , " offered Winters . " There would n't be an alliance without him , " agreed Mandel , anger on his normally passive face . " He 's a beacon of rationality in a sea of belching Neanderthals . " " If I may , sir ? Could your use of the word beacon ' be construed as a symbol ? " " That 's logical , " answered Gideon Logan . " Our Secretary of State is by all means a symbol of intelligent moderation . The nation , too , respects him . " " He intends to resign , " said Varak simply . " What ? " Sundstrom sat forward . " His loyalty to Jennings would n't permit it . " " His sense of integrity should n't permit him to stay , " said Winters with finality . " Out of loyalty , however , " explained Varak , " he 's agreed to attend the Middle East NATO conference at the UN mission on Cyprus in three weeks . It 's both a show of unity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a replacement who will be acceptable to the Congress . Then he leaves for pressing personal reasons , ' the main one being his frustration with the National Security Council , which continues to undercut him . " " Has he explained that to the President ? " asked Lowell . " According to my source , he has not , " replied Varak . " As Mr. Mandel has pointed out , he 's a rational man . He understands that it 's easier and far better for the country to replace one person than an entire council of presidential advisers . " " Tragic , " said Winters , " yet inevitable , I imagine . But how does the Secretary of State relate to Evan Kendrick ? I fail to sec the connection . "  | " It 's in the symbol itself , " said Eric Sundstrom . " He 's got to understandits importance . Am I right , Milos ? " " Yes , sir . If Kendrick 's convinced that it 's crucial for the country to have a strong vice president who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of reason within an imperial presidency  --  where the benign emperor frequently has no clothes  --  and that the world will breathe easier for it , then , in my judgment , he 'll again make the difficult choice and be available . " " From all we 've learned , I suppose he would , " agreed Gideon Logan . " But who the hell is going to convince him of that ? " " The only man he 'll listen to , " said Milos Varak , wondering if he was about to sign a death warrant . " Emmanuel Weingrass . " Ann Mulcahy O'Reilly was a Washington secretary not easily disturbed . Over the years since she and Paddy moved down from Boston , she had worked for the bright and the unbright , the would-be good and the would-be thieves ; nothing much surprised her anymore . But then she had never worked for anyone like Congressman Evan Kendrick . He was the all-time reluctant resident of Washington , its most persistently unwilling politician , and a perversely demurring hero . He had more ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cube , and he could vanish with the agility of the Invisible Man . Yet his proclivity for disappearing notwithstanding , the Congressman always left open lines of communication ; he would either call in on a fairly regular basis or leave a number where he could be reached . However , for the past two days there had been no word from Kendrick and no number at which he could be found . Those two facts by themselves would not normally have alarmed Mrs. O'Reilly , but two others did : throughout the day  --  since nine-twenty that morning  --  neitherthe house in Virginia nor the home in Colorado could be reached by telephone . In both cases the operators in Virginia and Colorado reported disruptions of service , and that status was still unchangedat nearly seven o'clock in the evening . That disturbed Annie O'Reilly . So quite logically she picked up the phone and dialed her husband at police headquarters . " O'Reilly , " said the gruff voice . " Detective squad . " " Paddy , it 's me . " " Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still at the office . " " Good . I 've got to talk to Evan . Manny called me a couple of days ago about some cockamamie license plates  --  "  | " That 's the point , " interrupted Mrs. O'Reilly . " I want to talk to him , too , but it seems I ca n't . " Annie told her husband about the strange coincidence of both the Congressman 's phones in Virginia and Colorado being out of order simultaneously and that he had neither checked in with her for the past two days nor left an alternate number where she could reach him . " And that 's not like him , Paddy . " " Call Congressional Security , " said the detective firmly . " In a pig 's ass I will . You whisper that lad 's name to Security all thebells go off , and you know what he thinks about those bells . He 'd havemy head in a basket if there 's even a halfway decent explanation . " " What do you want me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fairfax , darlin ' ? " " Sure . I 'll call Kearns in Arlington and have him send a radio car out there . What 's the address again ? " " No , Paddy , " said Mrs. O'Reilly quickly . " I can hear the bells already . That 's the police . " " What the hell do you think I do for a living ? Ballet ? " " I do n't want the police involved , what with reports and all . The Agency 's got guards out there and I could get my broadside in a wringer . I meant you , lover . You 're a friend in the area who just happens to be a cop doing a favor for your wife , who just happens to be Kendrick 's secretary . " " That 's a lot of just-happens , tiger .... What the hell ? I like beef stew . " " With extra potatoes , Paddy . " " And onions . Lots more onions . " " The biggest I can find  --  " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that shrinking violet has had both phones taken off the hook , you tell him I know about his girlfriend from Egypt and I just might leak it if he does n't call me . " " What girlfriend from  --  " " Button it , " ordered Mrs. O'Reilly . " Manny let it drop yesterday when he was a mite squiffed and could n't find his broth of a boy , either . Hurry along now . I 'll wait for the call here . " " What about my beef stew ? " " I 've got one frozen , " lied the lass born Ann Mary Mulcahy . Thirty-eight minutes later , after taking two wrong turns in the dark Virginia countryside , Detective First Grade O'Reilly found the road that led to Kendrick 's house . It was a road he had traveled over exactly fourp407times but never at night . Each trip had been made to see old Weingrass after he got out of the hospital and to bring him a freshly re-minted bottle of Listerine , since his nurses kept the Scotch whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny , who was about to be eighty years of age and who should have croaked on the operating table , wanted to go out a little pickled , who was to call it a sin ? Christ in all his glory turned water into wine , so why should n't a miserable sinner named O'Reilly turn a little pint of mouthwash into Scotch ? Both were for good Christian causes and he was only following the holy example . There were no streetlamps on the backcountry road , and were it not for the wash of his headlights , Paddy would have missed the brick wall and the white wrought-iron gate . Then he understood why ; there were no lights on in the house beyond . For all intents and purposes it was closed up , deserted , shut down while its owners were away . Yet its owner was not away and even if he were , there was the Arab couple from a place called Dubai who kept the place open and ready for the owner 's return . Any change in that routine or the dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Reilly , the Congressman 's number one girl in the office . Paddy stopped the car on the side of the road ; he snapped open the glove compartment , removed a flashlight , and got out . Instinctivelyhe reached under his jacket and felt the handle of his revolver in his shoulder holster . He approached the gate , expecting at any moment floodlights to be tripped on or the screeching sounds of multiple sirens to suddenly fill the quiet night . Those were the ways of Agency controls , methods of total protection . Nothing . O'Reilly arced his arm slowly through the bars of white wrought iron . ... Nothing . He then placed his hand on the center plate between the two joining gates and pushed . Both opened and still nothing . He walked inside , pushing the thumb of his left hand against the switch of the flashlight , his right hand reaching beneath his jacket . What he saw in seconds under the roving beam caused him to spin away , crouching into the wall , his weapon yanked out of the holster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my sins ! " he whispered . Ten feet away lay the dead body of a young , business-suited guard from the Central Intelligence Agency , sickeningly drenched in blood from the throat above , his head nearly severed from the rest of him . O'Reilly pressed his back against the brick wall , instantly extinguishing the flashlight , trying to calm his all too experienced nerves . He was familiar with violent death , and because he was , he knew that there was more to bep408found . He rose slowly to his feet and began his search for death , knowing also that the killers had disappeared . He found three other corpses , each mutilated , each life taken in shock , each positioned at 90 degrees of the compass for protection . Jesus ! How ? He bent down and examined the body of the fourth man ; what he found was extraordinary . Lodged in the guard 's neck was a snapped-off needle ; it was the remnants of a dart . The patrol had been immobilized by a narcotic and then , without defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of them knew . Patrick O'Reilly walked slowly , cautiously to the front door of the house , once again knowing that caution was irrelevant . The god-awful terrible deeds had been done ; there was nothing left but to total the casualties . There were six . Each throat was slit , each corpse covered with drying blood , each face in torment . Yet the most obscene of all were the naked bodies of Kendrick 's couple from Dubai . The husband was on top of his wife in the coital position , both red-soaked faces pressed against each other . And on the wall , scratched in human blood were the words : Death to God 's traitors ! Death to the fornicators of the Great Satan ! Where was Kendrick ? Mother of God ! Where was he ? O'Reilly raced back through the house , going from the cellar to the attic and room to room , turning on every switch he could find until the entire estate was a blaze of light . There was no sign of the Congressman ! Paddy ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evan 's Mercedes was gone , the Cadillac empty . He began searching the grounds again , crisscrossing every foot of woods and foliage within the fenced compound . Nothing . There were no signs of struggle , no broken shrubbery , no breaks in the Cyclone fence or scratches on the newly constructed brick wall . Forensic ! The department 's forensic division would find evidence . . . no ! He was thinking police procedures and this was beyond the police  --  far , far beyond ! O'Reilly ran back to the white wrought-iron gate , now awash with light , and raced to his car . He leaped inside and , disregarding the radio , yanked the police cellular phone from its recess under the dashhoard . He dialed , only at that moment realizing that his face and shirt were drenched with sweat in the cold night air . " Congressman Kendrick 's office . " " Annie , let me do the talking , " broke in the detective rapidly , softly . " And do n't ask questions  --  " " I know that tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Is he all right ? " ' There 's no sign of him . His car 's gone ; he 's not here . " " But others are  --  "  | " No more questions , tiger , but I 've got one for you , and by the saints you 'd better be able to answer it . " " What ? " " Who 's Evan 's contact at the Agency ? " " He deals directly with the unit . " " No . Someone else . Higher up . There has to be somebody ! " " Wait a minute ! " cried Annie , her voice rising . " Of course , there is . He just does n't talk about him . . . a man named Payton . A month or so ago he told me that if this Payton ever called , I was to put him through immediately , and if Evan was n't here I was to find him . " " You 're sure he 's with the CIA ? " " Yes , yes I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called me from Colorado saying he needed this ' Payton 's number and where I could find it in his desk  --  in the bottom drawer of his desk under a checkbook . It was a Langley exchange . " " Would it be there now ? " " I 'll look . Hold on . " The wait of no more than twenty seconds was nearly unbearable for the detective , made worse by the sight of the large brightly lighted house beyond the open gate . It was both an invitation and a target . " Paddy ? " " Yes ! " " I 've got it . " " Give it to me . Quickly ! " She did so , and O'Reilly issued an order that was not to be disobeyed . " Stay in the office until I call you or pick you up . Understood ? " " Is there a reason ? " " Let 's say I do n't know how far up , or down , or sideways , this kind of thing reaches , and I happen to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whispered Annie . O'Reilly did not hear his wife ; he had disconnected the line and within seconds was dialing the number Annie had given him . After eight agonizingrings a woman 's voice came over the phone . " Central Intelligence Agency , Mr. Payton 's office . " " Are you his secretary ? " " No , sir , this is the reception desk . Mr. Payton has gone for the day . " " Listen to me , please , " said the Washington detective with absolute control . " It 's urgent that I reach Mr. Payton immediately . Whatever the regulations , they can be broken , can you understand me , girl ? It 's an emergency . " Please identify yourself , sir . " " I tell 's fire , I do n't want to , but I will . I'ni lieutenant Patrick O'Reilly ,  |p410Detective  First Grade , District of Columbia Police Department . You 've got to find him for me ! " Suddenly , startlingly , a male voice was on the line . " O'Reilly ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary of a certain congressman ? " " The same , sir . You do n't answer your goddamned phone  --  excuse my language ? " " This is a trunk line to my apartment , Mr. O'Reilly . . . . You may switch systems , Operator . " " Thank you , sir . " There was a snap over the phone . " Yes , Mr. O'Reilly ? We 're alone now . " " I 'm not . I 'm in the company of six corpses thirty yards away from my car . " What ? " " Get out here , Mr. Payton . Kendrick 's house . And if you do n't want headlines , call off any relieving unit that 's heading here . " " Secure , " said the stunned director of Special Projects . " The relief comes on at midnight ; it 's covered by the men inside . " " They 're dead , too . They 're all dead . " Mitchell Payton crouched beside the dead body of the guard nearest the gate , wincing under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was so young . They 're all so young !

" I must . . . of course . " " But I wo n't unless you tell me where Congressman Kendrick is  --  if he is , or whether he was supposed to be here , which would mean he probably is n't . I can and obviously should call the Fairfax police . Am I clear , sir ? " " Gaelically clear , Lieutenant . For the time being this must remain an Agency problem  --  a catastrophe , if you like . Am I clear ? " " Answer my question or rest assured I 'll do my sworn duty and call Fairfax headquarters . Where is Congressman Kendrick ? His car 's not here and I want to know whether I should be relieved by that fact or not . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a very strange man " I mourn these people , these strangers to me , as I 've mourned hundreds like ' em in my time , but I know Evan Kendrick ! Now , if you have thep411information , I want it this very moment or I go to my vehicle and radio my report to the police in Fairfax . " " For God 's sake , do n't you threaten me , Lieutenant . If you want to know where Kendrick is , ask your wife ! " " My wife ? " " The Congressman 's secretary , in case it 's slipped your mind . " " You fancy rumbugger ! " exploded Paddy . " Why the hell do you think I 'm out here ? To pay a two-toilet social call on my old society chum , the millionaire from Colorado ?

Where the hell is he ? " " The Bahamas . Nassau , in the Bahamas . " " Why did you think my wife , his secretary , knew that ? And you 'd better have a good goddamned reason for thinking so , Dan Fancy , because if this is some kind of spook shit to involve Annie Mulcahy in one of your fuck-ups , I 'll have more blue jackets swarming around here than you got in Eyeran !

" " Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . " 1 low ever , he was explicit . The day before yesterday he said that on the way to the airport he would stop at his office and leave the information with his secretary , Ann O'Reilly . He stopped ; he went up to his office ; the mobile unit confirmed it . " " What time was that ? " " Around four-thirty , if I remember the mobile 's logs . " " Wednesday ? " " Yes .

" Sixty-five seconds later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Patrick O'Reilly 's wife came over the cellular phone 's speaker . " Congressman Kendrick 's  --  " " Annie , " interrupted her husband . " After you left the office Wednesdayafternoon , who was there ? " " Only Phil Tobias . It 's slow these days ; the girls left earlier . " " Phil who ? " " Tobias . He 's Evan 's chief aide and washer of the bottles . " " He never said anything to you , yesterday or today ? About seeing Kendrick , I mean . " " He has n't been here , Paddy . He did n't show up today or yesterday . I left half a dozen messages on his answering machine but I have n't heard from him , the high-hog PR brat that he is . " " I 'll talk to you later , tiger . Stay where you are . Understood ? " O'Reilly replaced the phone and turned in the seat , looking up at the man from the Central Intelligence Agency . " You heard , sir . I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it , Mr. Payton . " " I neither seek it nor want it , Lieutenant . We 've botched up so damned much in Langley that if someone thinks that his wife may be caught in one of our bungles , I ca n't fault him for telling us off . " " I 'm afraid that was it . . . . Who goes after Tobias ? You or me ? " " I ca n't deputize you , O'Reilly . There 's no provision for it in the law and , frankly , there are specific provisions against it , but I can ask for your help , and I desperately need it . I can cover for tonight on the basis of genuine national security ; you 're off the hook for not reporting . But where this Tobias is concerned I can only plead . " " For what ? " asked the detective , getting out of the car and quietly closing the door . " To keep me informed . " " You do n't have to plead for that  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That you 've got to plead for , " said Paddy , studying the director . " To begin with , I could n't guarantee it . If he 's spotted in Switzerland or floats up in the Potomac , I would n't necessarily know about it . "  | " We 're obviously thinking along the same lines . However , you have what 's referred to as clout , Lieutenant . Forgive me , but I 've had to learn about everyone around Evan Kendrick . The District of Columbia Police Department virtually bribed you to come to Washington twelve years ago from Boston  --  " " Grade pay , nothing shady . " " Grade pay nearly equivalent to chief of detectives , a position you turned down four years ago because you did n't want the desk . " " Holy Jesus  --  " " I 've had to be thorough . . . . And since your wife works for the Congressman , I believe a man in your position could insist on being informed if and when anything relevant to Phillip Tobias comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kendrick 's office . " " I suppose I could , that 's my girl . But it leads me to a question or two . " " Go right ahead . Any questions you have may help me . " " Why is Evan in the Bahamas ? " " I sent them there . " " Them ? The Egyptian woman ? . . . Old Weingrass told my wife . " " She works for us ; she was part of Oman . There 's a man in Nassau who fronted a company that Kendrick was briefly associated with years ago . He 's not terribly reputable and neither was the firm , but we felt he was worth checking out . " " For what purpose ? " The director of Special Projects looked over the roof of the car at Evai- Kendrick 's house , at the now dimly lit windows and what they held beyond the glass . " All that will come later , O'Reilly . I wo n't hold anything back , I promise you . But from what you 've described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the shroud squad and that can only be done at my car . " The shroud squad ? What the hell is that ? " " A group of men neither of us would care to be a part of . They pick up corpses they can never testify about , forensically examine evidence they 've been sworn not to reveal . They 're necessary and I respect every one of them , but I would n't be one of them . " Suddenly , the staccato , grating ring of the detective 's cellular telephone erupted . It had been tripped to Emergency , the sound echoing throughout the still , cold night , bouncing off the brick wall , each echo receding into the woods beyond . O'Reilly yanked open the door and grabbed fhc phone , pulling it to his ear . " ) es ' " " Oh , Jesus , Paddy ! " screamed Ann Mulcahy O'Reilly , her voice am plified over the speaker " ' Hwy found hint ! They found Phil ! Ile wasp414down under the boilers in the basement . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , he 's dead , Paddy ! " " When you say ' they , ' exactly who do you mean , tiger ? " " Harry and Sam from night maintenance  --  they just reached me , scared out of their skins , and told me to call the police ! " " You just did , Annie . Tell them to stay where they are . They 're not to touch anything or say anything until I get there ! Understood ? " " Not say anything . . . ? " " It 's a quarantine , I 'll explain later . Now call C-Security and have five men armed with shotguns posted outside the office . Say your husband 's a police officer and he made the request because of personal threats against him . Understood ? " " Yes , Paddy , " replied Mrs. O'Reilly , in tears . " Oh , holy Jesus , he 's dead ! " The detective spun around in the seat . The CIA director was running to his car.  |p415It  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weingrass 's patience had run out . It had been close to eleven o'clock in the morning when he personally discovered that the phone was not working , subsequently learning that two of the nurses had known it several hours earlier when they tried to place calls . One of the girls had driven into Mesa Verde to use the grocery store phone and report the disrupt ion of service to the telephone company ; she returned with the assurance that the problem would be repaired as soon as possible . " Possible " had now dragged out over five hours , and that was unacceptable to Manny . A renowned congressman  --  to say nothing of the national hero that the was  --  demanded far better treatment ; it was an affront Weingrass had no intention of tolerating . And although he said nothing to his coven of witches , he had bad thoughts  --  disturbing thoughts . " Hear this , you prognosticators for the Thane of Cawdor ! " he shouted at the top of his lungs on the glass-enclosed veranda at the two nurses playing gin rummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , Manny ? " asked the third from a chair by the arch in the living room , lowering her newspaper " Macbeth , you illiterate . I 'm laying down the law ! " " The law 's the only thing you could handle in that department , Methu clap ( : 1n ! " p 416 " So little you know about the Bible , Miss Erudite . . . . I will not remain beyond reach of the outside world any longer . One of you will either drive me into town , where I can call the president of this meshugenah telephonecompany or I will urinate all over the kitchen . " " You 'll be in a straitjacket first , " said one of the girls playing cards . " Wait a minute , " countered her partner . " He can call the Congressmanand he could put on some pressure . I really have to reach Frank . He 's flying out tomorrow  --  I told you  --  and I have n't been able to make a reservation at the motel in Cortez . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living room . " He can call from Abe Hawkins 's grocery store . " " Knowing you dears , sex will out , " said Manny . " But we call from the phone in Gee-Gee 's office . I do n't trust anyone named Abraham . He probably sold weapons to the Ayatollah and forgot to make a profit . ... I 'll just get a sweater and my jacket . " " I 'll drive , " offered the nurse in the living room , dropping the newspaperbeside the chair and rising . " Put on your overcoat , Manny . It 's cold and there 's a strong wind from the mountains . " Weingrass muttered a minor epithet as he passed the woman and headed for his bedroom in the south wing of the first floor . Once out of sight in the stone hallway , he hastened his pace ; he had more to retrieve than a sweater . Inside his large room , redesigned by him to include sliding glass doors across the south wall opening onto a flagstone terrace , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair from his desk to the tall dresser . Cautiously , holding on to the knobs , he climbed on the chair , reached over the curlicued top of the imposing piece of furniture and removed a shoe box . He lowered himself back to the floor , carried the box to the bed and opened it , revealing a .38 caliber automatic and three clips of shells . The concealment was necessary . Evan had given orders that his shotguncase be locked and all ammunition removed , and that no handguns be permitted in the house . The reason had been too painful for either man to bring up : Kendrick believed with more logic than less that if his old friend thought the cancer had returned , he would take his own life . But for Emmanuel Weingrass , after the life he had led , to be without a weapon was anathema to him . Gee-Gee Gonzalez had remedied the situation , and Manny had only once smashed open the shotgun case and that was when the media had descended on them pissing all over the grounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pockets , and carried the chair hack to the desk . He went to his closet , took a long , heavy-knitp417sweater from the shelf and slipped it on ; it covered the protrusions effectively . He then did something he had not done since the redesigned room had been built , not even when the reporters and the television crews had assaulted them . He inspected the locks on the sliding doors , crossed to a red switch hidden behind the drapes , and turned on the alarm . He walked out of the bedroom , closing the door , and joined the nurse in the front hall ; she was holding his overcoat for him . " That 's a handsome sweater , Manny . " " I got it on sale in a Monte Carlo acres-ski shop . " " Do you always have to have a flip answer ? " " No kidding , it 's true . " " Here , put on your coat . " " I look like a Hasid in that thing . " " A what ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think it 's very masculine  --  " " Oy , let 's get out of here . " Weingrass started for the door , then stopped . " Girls ! " he shouted , his voice carrying to the veranda . " Yes , Manny ? " " What ? " " Please listen to me , ladies , I 'm serious . I 'd feel much more comfort , ble , what with the phone being out , if you would please turn on the niaiii alarm . Humor me , my lovelies . I 'm a foolish old man to you , I realize that , but I really would feel better if you did this for me . " " How sweet of him  --  " " Of course we will , Manny . " That humble crap always works , thought Weingrass , continuing toward the door . " Come on , hurry up , " he said to the nurse behind him who was struggling with her parka . " I want to get to Gee-Gee 's before that phone company closes up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong ; the trek from the massive front door to Kendrick 's Saab Turbo halfway down the circular drive was made by leaning into the gusts . Manny shielded his face with his left hand , his head turned to the right , when suddenly the wind and his discomfort became irrelevant . At first he thought that the swirling leaves and erratic pockets of dust were distorting his still-viable eyesight  --  and then he knew it was not so . There was movement , human movement , beyond the tall hedges that fronted the road . A figure had rushed to t he right , lurching to the ground behind , I particularly thick area of the foliage . .. Then another ! This one following the first and going taut h . " You okay , Manny ' shouted the nurse as they approached the ( al " This stuff is kindergarten compared with the passes in the Maritime Alps ! " yelled back Weingrass . " Get in . Hurry up . " " Oh , I 'd love to see the Alps someday ! " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saab , his right hand unobtrusively slipping under the overcoat and the sweater to reach his automatic . He pulled it out and lowered it between the seat and the door as the nurse inserted the key and started the engine . " When you get to the road , turn left , " he said . " No , Manny , you 're wrong . The quickest way to Mesa Verde is to the right . " " I know that , lovely thing , but I still want you to turn left . " " Manny , if you 're trying to pull something at your age I 'm going to be furious ! " " Just turn left , drive around the curve , and stop . " " Mister Weingrass , if you think for an instant  --  " " I 'm getting out , " broke in the old architect quietly . " I do n't want to alarm you , and I 'll explain everything later , but right now you 're going to do exactly as I tell you . . . . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny 's soft-spoken words but she understood the look in his eyes . There were no theatrics , no bombast ; he was simply giving her an order . " Thank you , " he continued , as she drove out between the wall of tall hedges and swung left . " I want you to take the Mancos road back into Verde  --  " " That 'll add at least ten minutes  --  " " I know , but it 's what I want you to do . Go directly to Gee-Gee 's as fast as you can and tell him to call the police  --  " " Manny ! " cried the nurse , interrupting as she tightly gripped the wheel . " I 'm sure it 's nothing at all , " said Weingrass quickly , reassuringly . " Probably just someone whose car broke down or a hiker who 's lost . Nevertheless , it 's better to check these things out , do n't you think ? " " I do n't know what to think , but I 'm certainly not letting you out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " disagreed Manny , casually raising the automatic as if studying the trigger housing , no threat at all in his action . " Good God ! " yelled the nurse . " I 'm perfectly safe , my dear , because I 'm a cautious man to the point of cowardice . . . . Stop here , please . " The near-panicked woman did as she was told , her frightened eyes shifting rapidly back and forth between the weapon and the old man 's face . " Thank you , " said Weingrass , opening the door , the sound of the wind sudden , powerful . " I 'll probably findp419our harmless visitor inside having coffee with the girls , " he added , steppingout and closing the door by pressing it shut . Wheels spinning , the Saab raced away . No matter , thought Manny , the gusts of wind covered the sound . As it also covered whatever sounds he made heading back toward tine house , unavoidable sounds , as he stayed out of sight on the border of tiro road , his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lc was as grateful for the racing dark clouds above in the sky as he was lot the dark overcoat ; both kept his being seen to a minimum . Five minutes later and several yards deeper into the woods , he stood by a thick tree at midpoint opposite the wall of hedges . He again shielded his face frorrr tire  --  wind and , squinting , peered across the road . They were there ! And they were not lost . His disturbing thoughts had been valid . And rather than being lost the intruders were waiting  --  for something or someone . Both men wore leather jackets and were crouched in front of the hedges talking rapidly to each other , the man on the right constantly , impatiently glancing at his wristwatch . Weingrass did not have to be told what that meant ; they were waiting for someone or more than someone . Awkwardly , feeling his age physically but not in his irrragi nation , Manny lowered himself to the ground and began prowling around on his hands and knees , not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it , whatever it was . It was a thick , heavy limb newly blown down by the wind , sap st ill oozing from the shards where it had been snapped from a larger source in the trunk . It was about forty inches long ; it was swingable . Slowly , more awkwardly and painfully , the old man rose to his feet and made his way back to the tree where he had been standing , diagonally across the road from the two intruders no more than fifty feet away . It was a gamble , but then so was what was left of his life , and the odds were infinitely better than they were at roulette or chemin do fer . " I'he  --  results , too , would be known more quickly , and the gambler in Enunarrucl Weingrass was willing to place a decent bet that one of the intruders would stay where he was out of basic common sense . The aged architect moved back in the woods , selecting his position as carefully as if he were refining a final blueprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le was , the client was himself . Make total use of the natural surroundings had been axiomatic with him all his professional life ; he did not veer from that rule now . There were two poplars , both wide and about seven feet apart fornung an abstract forest gate . Ile concealed himself behind the trunk on the right , gripped the heavy limb and raised it until it leaned against the bankp420above his head . The wind careened through the trees , and through the multiple sounds of the forest he opened his mouth and roared a short singsong chant , one-third human , two-thirds animal . He craned his neck and watched . Between the trunks and the lower foliage , he could see the startled figures across the road . Both men spun around in their crouching positions , the man on the right gripping his companion 's shoulder , apparently  --  hopefully , prayed Manny  --  issuing orders . He had . The man on the left got to his feet , pulled a gun from inside his jacket , and started for the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Timing and direction , the brief , seductive sounds leading the quarry into the fatal sea of green as surely as the sirens lured Ulysses . Twice more Weingrass emitted the eerie calls , and then a third that was so pronounced that the intruder rushed forward , slapping branches in front of him , his weapon leveled , his feet digging into the soft earth  --  toward and finally into the forest gate . Manny pulled back on the thick , heavy limb and swung it with all his strength down and across into the head of the racing man . The face was shattered , blood spurting out of every feature , the skull a mass of broken bone and cartilage . The man was dead . Breathlessly , Weingrass walked out from behind the trunk and knelt down . The man was an Arab . The winds from the mountains continued their assault . Manny pulled the gun from the corpse 's still-warm hand and , even more awkwardly , far more painfully , edged his way back toward the road . The dead intruder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept spinning his head toward the woods , toward the road from Mesa Verde and down at his watch . The only thing he had not done was display a weapon , and that told Weingrass something else . The terrorist  --  and he was a terrorist ; both were terrorists  --  was either a rank amateur or a thorough professional , nothing in between . Feeling the pounding echo in his frail chest , Manny permitted himself a few moments to breathe , but only moments . The opportunity might not come again . He moved north , from tree trunk to tree trunk , until he was sixty feet above the anxious man , who kept glancing south . Again timing ; Weingrass walked as fast as he could across the road and stood motionless , watching . The would-be killer was now close to apoplectic ; twice he started into the road toward the woods , both times returning to the hedges and crouching , staring at his watch . Manny moved forward , his automatic gripped in his veined right hand . When he was within ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he roared , calling the man a butcher in Arabic . " If you move , you 're dead ! Fahem ? " The dark-skinned man spun around , clawing the earth as he rolled into the hedges , loose dirt flying up into the old architect 's face . Through the hurling debris , Weingrass understood why the terrorist had not displayed a weapon ; it was on the ground beside him , inches from his hand . Manny fell to his left on the road as the man grabbed the gun , now lunging backward , enmeshing himself in prickly green web , and fired twice ; the reports were barely heard ! They were two eerily muted spits in the wind ; a silencer was attached to the terrorist 's pistol . The bullets , however , were not silent ; one shrieked through the air above Weingrass , the second ricocheted off the cement near his head . Manny raised his automatic and pulled the trigger , the calm of experience , despite the years , steadying his hand . The terrorist screamed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes wide , a rivulet of blood trickling from the base of his throat . Hurry up , you decrepit bastard ! cried Weingrass to himself , struggling to his feet . They were waiting for someone ! You want to be a senile ugly duck in a gallery ? Your meshugenah head blown off would serve you right . Shush ! Every bone is boiling in pain ! Manny lurched toward the body wedged in the hedges . He bent down , pulled the corpse forward , then gripped the man 's feet , and , grimacing , using every iota of strength that was in him , dragged the body across the road and into the woods . He wanted only to lie on the ground and rest , to let the hammering in his chest subside and swallow air , but he knew he could not do that He had to keep going ; he had to be ready ; above all , he had to take someone alive . These people were after his son ! Information had to be learned . . . all manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine in the distance . . . and then the sound disappeared . Bewildered , he sidestepped slowly , cautiously , between the trees to the edge of the woods and peered out . A car was corning up the road from Mesa Verde , but it was either idling or coasting , or the wind was too strong . It was coasting , for now only the rolling tires could be heard as it approached the wall of tall hedges , barely moving , finally stopping before the first entrance to the circular drive . Two men were inside ; the driver , a stocky man , not young but not much over forty , got out first and looked around , obviously expecting to be met or signaled . Ile squinted in the dark afternoon light and , seeing no one , crossed the road to the wooded side and started walking forward . Weingrass shoved Iris automatic into his belt and bent down for the second killer 's pistol with the perforated silencer attached to the barrel . It was too large for a txx kc t , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . He stood up and stepped farther back into the overgrowth ; he checked the weapon 's cylinder . There were four bullets left . The man approached ; he was now directly in front of Manny . " Yosef ! " The name was suddenly carried on the wind , half shouted by the driver 's companion , who had left the car and was racing down the road , his quickening steps impeded by a pronounced limp . Manny was perplexed ; Yosef was a Hebrew name , yet these killers were not Israelis . " Be quiet , boy ! " commanded the older man gruffly in Arabic as his partner stopped breathlessly in front of him . " You raise your voice like that again  --  anywhere  --  I 'll ship you back to the Baaka in a coffin ! " Weingrass watched and listened to the two men no more than twenty feet away on the edge of the road . He was mildly astonished , but now understood the use of the Arabic word , walad , or " boy . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen or seventeen , if that . " You 'll send me nowhere ! " answered the young man angrily , a speech impediment obvious , undoubtedly a harelip . " I 'll never walk properly again because of that pig ! I could have become a great martyr of our holy cause but for him ! " " Very well , very well , " said the older Arab with a Hebrew name , not without a degree of compassion . " Throw cool water on your neck or your head will explode . Now , what is it ? " " The American radio ! I just heard it and I understand enough to  --  understand ! " " Our people at the other house ? " " No , nothing like that . The Jews ! They executed old Khouri . They hanged him ! " " What did you expect , Aman ? Forty years ago he was still working with the German Nazis left in northern Africa . He killed Jews ; he blew up kibbutzim , even a hotel in Haifa . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old men of the Irgun and the Stern ! Khouri was a symbol of greatness for us  --  " " Oh , be quiet , boy . Those old men fought the British more than they did us . They , or old Khouri , have nothing to do with what we must do today . We must teach a lesson to a filthy politician who pretended to be one of us . He hid in our clothes and used our tongue and betrayed the friendship we offered him . Now , boy ! Concentrate on now . " " Where are the others ? They were to come out on the road . " " I do n't know . They may have learned something or seen something and gone inside the house . Lights are being turned on now ; you can see through those high bushes . Each of us will crawl up from either side ofp423the half-circle entrance . Go through the grass to the windows . We will probably learn that our comrades are having coffee with whoever is there before slicing their throats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the trunk of a tree , moving it back and forth between the two terrorists . I Ic wanted both alive ! The words in Arabic referring to the " other house " so shocked him that in fury he might well blow both their heads away . They wanted to kill his son ! If they had they would pay dearly , in agony  --  misguided youth or age irrelevant . Terrible pain would he the only consequence . He leveled the weapon at the pelvic region of both killers , back and forth , back and forth ... . He fired just as a sudden gust of wind swirled along the road , two rounds into the older man , one into the boy . It was as if neither could possibly comprehend . The child collapsed screaming , writhing on the ground ; his elder companion was made of stronger  --  much stronger  --  stuff . Ile staggeredto his feet , turning to the source of fire , and lurched forward , the stocky hulk a furious monster in pain . " Do n't come any closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yond endurance and holding on to the tree . " I do n't want to kill you , but I will ! You of the Hebrew name who kills Jews ! " " My mother ! " screamed the approaching giant of a man . " She re nounced all of you ! You are killers of my people ! You take everything that is ours and spit on us ! I am half Jew , but who are the Jews to kill my father and shave the head of my mother because she loved an Arab ? I will take you to hell ! " Weingrass held on to the trunk of the tree , his fingernails bleeding as he dug into the bark , his long black overcoat billowing in the wind . The broad , dark figure lunged out of the forest darkness , his enormous hands gripping the old man 's throat . " Do n't ! " screamed Manny , knowing instantly that there was no choice . He fired the last shell , the bullet penetrating the wrinkled forehead above him . Yosef fell away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping for breath , Weingrass leaned against the tree , staring down at the ground , at the body of a man who had been in torment over an insignificantterritorial arrangement that forced humans to kill each other . In that moment , Emmanuel Weingrass came to a conclusion that had eluded him from the moment he was capable of thinking ; lie knew the answer now . The arrogance of blind belief led all the mendacities of human thought . It pitted man viciously against mail in the pursuit of the ultimate unknowable . Who had the right ?  | " Yosef . . . Yosef , " cried the boy , rolling over in the underbrush by the edge of the road . " Where are you ? I 'm hit , I 'm hit ! " The child did not know , thought Weingrass . From where the wounded boy lay writhing he could not see , and the wind from the mountains further muffled the muted gunshot . The maniacal young terrorist did not realize that his comrade Yosef was dead , that he alone had survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there could be no new martyr for a holy cause brought on by self-inflicted death . Not here , not now ; there were facts to be learned , facts that could save the life of Evan Kendrick . Especially now ! Weingrass shoved his bleeding fingers into his overcoat pocket and dropped the silenced weapon on the ground . Summoning what strength he had left , he pushed himself away from the tree and made his way as quickly as he could south through the woods , stumbling again and again , his frail arms pushing the branches from his face and body . He veered toward the road ; he reached it and saw the killer 's car in the darkening distance . He had gone far enough . He turned and started back on the mercifully smooth surface  --  faster . . . faster ! Move your goddamned spindly legs ! That boy must not move , he must not crawl , he must not see ! Manny felt the blood rushing to his head , the pounding in his rib cage deafening . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling into the woods . In moments he would see his dead companion ! It could not happen ! " Aman ! " shouted Weingrass breathlessly , remembering the name used by the half-Jew , Yosef , as if it were his own . " Ayn ent ? Kai f el-ahwal ? " he continued in Arabic , urgently asking the boy where he was and how he was . " Itkallem ! " he roared against the wind , ordering the young terroristto respond . " Here , in here ! " yelled the teenage Arab in his own language . " I 've been shot ! In the hip . I ca n't find Yosef ! " The young man rolled over on his back to greet an expected comrade . " Who are you ? " he screamed , struggling to reach under his field jacket for a gun as Manny approached . " I do n't know you ! " Weingrass smashed his foot against the boy 's elbow , and as the empty hand whipped out from under the cloth he stepped on it , pinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of that , you fool of a child ! " said Manny , his Arabic that of a Saudi officer reprimanding a lowly recruit . " We have n't covered you to have you cause even more trouble . Of course you were shot , and I trust you realize that you were merely wounded , not killed , which could have been easily managed ! " " What arc you saying ? "  | " What were you doing ? " shouted Manny in reply . " Running in t he road , raising your voice , crawling around our objective like a thief in the night ! Yosef was right , you should be shipped back to the Baaka . " " Yosef ? ... Where is Yosef ? " " Up in the house with the others . Come , I 'll help you . Join them . " Afraid of falling over , Weingrass held on to the branch of a sapling as t h e terrorist pulled himself up , gripping Manny 's hand . " First , give me your weapon ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't want you armed . " " I do n't understand  --  " " You do n't have to . " Weingrass slapped the bewildered young fanatic across the face and simultaneously shoved his right hand between the buttoned fold of the boy 's jacket to pull out the would-be killer 's gull . I t was appropriate ; it was a .22 caliber pistol . " You can shoot gnats wit II this , " said Manny , grabbing the teenager 's arm . " Come along . flop on one foot if it 's easier . We 'll paste you up . " What remained of the late afternoon sun was obscured by the swirling dark clouds of a gathering storm surging out of the mountains . The drained , exhausted old man and the wounded youngster were halfway across the road when suddenly the roar of an engine was heard and headlights of a racing automobile caught them in the beams . The car was bearing down on them , thundering up from the south out of Mesa Verde Tires shrieking , the powerful vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards away from Weingrass and his captive , who were lunging toward the hedges , Manny 's grip tightening on the Arab 's field jacket . A man leaped from the large black sedan as Weingrass  --  lnrchiug , stumbling  --  reached into his overcoat pocket for his own .38 automatic The figure rushing toward him was a blur in the old architect 's eyes ; Ile raised his gun to fire . " Manny ! " yelled Gee-Gee Gonzalez . Weingrass fell to the ground , his hand still gripping the wounded terrorist . " Grab him ! " he ordered Gee-Gee with what seemed like the last breath in his lungs . " Do n't let him go  --  hold his arms . ' I'hcy sonictinies carry cyanide ! " The young Arab was given a needle by one of the two nurses ; he would be unconscious until morning . I lis bullet wound was bloody , not serious , the bullet itself having passed through the flesh ; it was cleansed , the openings butterfliecl with heavy tape and the bleeding stopped . lie wasp426then carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strapped to the four corners of the bed , where the nurses covered his naked body with two blankets to help prevent conceivable trauma . " He 's so terribly young , " said the nurse placing the pillow under the teenage Arab 's head . " He 's a killer , " responded Weingrass icily , staring at the terrorist 's face . " He 'd kill you without thinking for an instant about the life he was taking  --  the way he wants to kill Jews . The way he will kill us if we let him live . " " That 's revolting , Mr. Weingrass , " said the other nurse . " He 's a child . " " Tell that to the parents of God knows how many Jewish children who were never permitted his years . " Manny left the room to rejoin Gonzalez , who had hastily gone outside to drive his all too recognizable car into a garage ; he had returned and was pouring himself a large glass of whisky at the bar on the veranda . " Help yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heading for his leather armchair . " I 'll put it on your bill like you do with me . " You crazy old man ! " spat out Gee-Gee . " Loco ! You plain loco , you know that ? You coulda been killed ! Muerto ! You comprende ? Muerto , muerto  --  dead , dead , dead , you old fool ! Maybe that I could live with , but not when you give me a heart attack ! I do n't live so good with a heart attack when it 's fatal , you comprende , you know what I mean ? " " Okay , okay . So you can have that drink on the house  --  " " Loco ! " shouted Gonzalez again , drinking the whisky in what appeared to be a single swallow . " You 've made your point , " agreed Manny . " Have another . I wo n't start charging until the third . " " I do n't know whether to go or whether to stay ! " said Gee-Gee , once more pouring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you , who had time for the police ? And if I called them , they 'd come around in a month ! ... Your girl , the ama de cria  --  the nurse  --  she 's calling them . I only hope she found one of those payasos . Sometimes you got ta call Durango to get someone out here . " The phone on the bar rang  --  it rang , but it was not the ring of a telephone ; instead it was a steady whir-toned sound . Weingrass was so startled that he nearly fell to the floor pushing himself out of the chair . " You want me to get it ? " asked Gonzalez . " No ! " roared Manny , walking rapidly , unsteadily , toward the bar . " Do n't bite off my cabeza. "  | " Hello ? " said the old man into the phone , forcing control on himself " Mr. Weingrass ? " " Perhaps yes , perhaps no . Who are you ? " " We 're on a laser patch into your telephone line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all about you , " interrupted Manny . " Is my boy all right ? " " Yes , he is . I 've just spoken to him in the Bahamas . A military aircraft has been dispatched from Homestead Air Force Base to pick him up . I lc 'll be in Washington in a few hours . " " Keep him there ! Surround him with guards ! Do n't let anyone near him ! " " Then it 's happened out there ? . . . I feel so useless , so incompetent . I should have posted guards . . . . How many were killed ? " " Three , " said Manny . " Oh , my God . . . . How much do the police know ? " " They do n't . They have n't got here yet . " " They have n't . ... Listen to me , Mr. Weingrass . What I 'm about to say will appear strange if not insane to you , but I know what I 'm talking about . For the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a far greater chance to catch the bastards by avoiding panic and Ict I ing our own experts go to work . Can you understand that , Mr. Weingrass ' " " Understood and arranged , " answered an old man who had worked with the Mossad , a certain impatient condescension creeping into Isis voice . " The police will be met outside and told it was a false alarm -- a neighbor whose car had broken down and could n't reach us on the phone , that 's all . " " I forgot , " said the director of Special Project quietly . " You 've been here before . " " I 've been here , " agreed Manny , without comment . " Wait a minute ! " exclaimed Payton . " You said three were dead , halt you 're talking to me , you 're all right . " " The three were them , not us , Mr. CIA Incompetent . " " What ? . . . Jesus Christ ! " " He was n't much help . Try Abraham . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to kill them . But the fourth 's alive and under sedation . Cet your experts out here before I kill him , too . "
