The animals stand motionless in gold-white grasses  --  zebras and impala , Thomson 's gazelles and Cape buffalo and hartebeests and waterbuck and giraffes , and wildebeests by the thousands , all fixed in art naif , in a smiting equatorial light . They stand in the shadowless clarity of creation . <P> Now across the immense African landscape , from the distant escarpment , a gray-purple rainstorm blows . It encroaches upon the sunlight , moving through the air like a dark idea . East Africa has a genius for such moments . Wildlife and landscape here have about them a force of melodrama and annunciation . They are the Book of Genesis enacted as an afternoon dream . <P> In Amboseli , under the snow-covered dome of Mount Kilimanjaro , a herd of elephants moves like a dense gray cloud , slow motion , in lumbering solidity : a mirage of floating boulders . Around them dust devils rise spontaneously out of the desert , little tornadoes that swirl up on the thermals and go jittering and rushing among the animals like evil spirits busy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last light of the afternoon , a lion prowls in lion- colored grasses and vanishes into the perfect camouflage  --  setting off for the hunt , alert , indolent and somehow abstracted , as cats are . A rhinoceros disappears : the eye loses it among gray boulders and thorn trees . The rhino becomes a boulder . <P> To the human eye , the animals so often seem mirages : now you see them , now you do n't . Later , just after dusk , Abyssinian nightjars discover the magic wash of the headlight beams . The birds flit in and out of the barrels of light , like dolphins frisking before a boat 's prow . The Land Cruiser jostles , in four-wheel drive , across black volcanic stones toward the camp , the driver steering by the distant light-speck of the cooking fire . <P> And then the African night , which , more than elsewhere , seems an abnegation of the conscious world . MMBA , " miles and miles of bloody Africa , " and it all falls into black magic void . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of sleep , hyenas come to giggle and whoop . Peering from the tent flap , one catches in the shadows their sidelong criminal slouch . Their eyes shine like evil flashlight bulbs , a disembodied horror-movie yellow , phosphorescent , glowing like the children of the damned . In the morning , one finds their droppings : white dung , like a photographic negative . Hyenas not only eat the meat of animals but grind up and digest the bones . The hyenas ' dung is white with the calcium of powdered bones . <P> Africa has its blinding clarities and its shadows . The clarities proclaim something primal , the first days of life . The shadows lie at the other extreme of time : in the premonition of last days , of extinction . Now you see the animals . Soon , perhaps , you wo n't . <P> Africa is comprehensive : great birth , great death , the beginning and the end . The themes are drawn , like the vivid , abstract hide of the zebra , in patterns of the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildlife of Africa can survive . <P> The second question is this : If the wild animals of Africa vanish from the face of the earth , what , exactly , will have been lost ?
