In their first playoff appearance in 12 seasons , the Jets made too many mistakes in falling behind by 24-0 , and the Buffalo Bills captured the American Conference wild-card game , 31-27. // Ten minutes into the second quarter the Bills had three touchdowns and a field goal , and no team in the playoffs had ever come back after trailing by so many points . Still , the Jets kept thousands of fans at Shea Stadium standing at the end as they made their final attempt. // With 10 seconds remaining , the Jets were 11 yards from the end zone and trailing by 31-27 . On second down , Richard Todd , the quarterback , looked for Derrick Gaffney in the end zone , in front of the scoreboard flashing " WE CAN DO IT , " and threw the ball. // " All of a sudden , " Gaffney recalled , " out of the corner of my eye , I saw something coming . And that was it . " It was Simpson . He intercepted the pass on the 1-yard line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last two seconds . Buffalo , which finished third behind the Jets in the Eastern Division , will go to Cincinnati to play the Bengals , the Central Division champion , in a conference semifinal game at 1 P.M. Sunday . In the other semifinal game at 5 P.M. Saturday , San Diego , the West champion , will play at Miami , the East champion. // When the Jets force themselves over the winter to recall yesterday ' s game , the memory will start with the first play . Bruce Harper caught the opening kickoff at the closed end of Shea Stadium and took off as many in the crowd of 57 , 050 were still headed for their seats in the light rain. // Harper , who is 5 foot 8 inches and 180 pounds , was hit on the 25-yard-line by Ervin Parker , who is 6-5 , 240 pounds . Harper , who said the tackle had " stunned " him , fumbled . Jerry Romes picked up the ball on the 26 and , before the Jets , the fans and the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike-Mayer kicked the extra point for a 7-0 lead after 16 seconds . <> <> Crowd Encourages Harper // These were not the Jets ' fans of September , when the team had lost its first three games , including a 31-0 loss in their season-opener at Buffalo. // The crowd yesterday greeted the Bills ' touchdown with silence , not booing . These were fans who produced their outsized yellow-foam hands - with a finger pointing up , signifying " Number One . " And they backed Harper . They encouraged him in his second runback attempt , chanting " Bruce , Bruce. " // Harper recovered , but his teammates did not . On the Jets ' second drive , Todd moved the team to the Bills ' 30-yard-line . Then he sent Wesley Walker , the wide receiver , sprinting downfield . Walker was alone in the end zone when Todd hit him with a pass . It squirted through his fingers. // Instead of a 7-7 tie , the Jets wound up punting , and the Bills started another scoring drive . The fumble by Harper and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jets , who also had these problems : // - Johnny ( Lam ) Jones , the wide receiver , was unable to start . Jones , who had played well in his last three games with 11 receptions and two touchdowns , was sidelined with a hamstring injury that had not been expected to keep him from playing. // - On the opening drive by the Jets , Marvin Powell , their all-pro right tackle , had to leave after having back spasms . John Roman , normally a left tackle and accustomed to a different stance and different movements , was called in to replace him and help protect Todd . Powell never returned. // - Jerome Barkum , the tight end and a clutch third-down receiver , left in the first quarter with a hamstring injury . He never returned , and Mickey Shuler replaced him. // - Jesse Johnson , who had been the Jets ' left cornerback the last month , could not start because of a knee injury . Donald Dykes , returning slowly from an arm injury , took his place . <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran quarterback , quickly picked on Dykes on the Bills ' drive that followed Walker ' s drop. // Ferguson passes to Frank Lewis , the wide receiver , in front of Dykes on the Jets ' 25 , and Lewis ran the remaining 25 yards to complete a 50-yard touchdown play . Mike-Mayer converted , and it was 14-0. // The confusion continued . Todd , getting pressure from Ben Williams , who was Roman ' s assignment , was intercepted by Rufus Bess , who returned it 49 yards to the Jets ' 12 . That set up a 29-yard Mike-Mayer field goal. // The Jets , who had kept opposing teams scoreless in the opening quarter in nine of the last 11 games , and had not given up more than 7 points in any first quarter this season , trailed by 17-0 in the first period. // Perhaps it would change for the Jets . Perhaps a big play by the defense , which led pro football with 66 sacks , would turn the game around . <> <> Gastineau Flubs Fumble // It appeared it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gastineau , the defensive end , broke through and hit Ferguson ' s arm as he was trying to pass . The ball was knocked loose and started bouncing crazily. // Gastineau didn ' t merely try to retrieve it , or fall on it . He attempted to grab it on the run , hoping to bring it in for a touchdown . Instead , he kicked it . He got close again and , again , he tried to scoop the ball . He could only advance it more , and the Bills recovered . Gastineau was credited with a sack on the play , one of only two the Jets made. // On the Jets ' next drive , they turned the ball over again when a pass by Todd was intercepted for the second of four times in the game . The interception by Phil Villapiano , a linebacker , set up another Buffalo score. // Ferguson then noticed that Bobby Jackson , reactivated Saturday after missing five game with a broken arm , was substituting for Dykes . With the Jets blitzing , Jackson was alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone . Ferguson hit him with a 26-yard touchdown pass. // That increased the Buffalo lead to 24-0 with more than 5 minutes remaining before halftime . The offense that had brought the Jets this far appeared too weak to attempt a comeback . <> <> Shuler Scores Touchdown // Gaffney , playing for Jones , had caught only one pass the last six games . Shuler , in for Barkum , had missed the first nine games with an injury and had not caught a pass in the seven games since. // But Shuler and Todd teamed up as the Jets finally scored , late in the second quarter , on a 30-yard play . Pat Leahy converted . Later in the half , the Bills tried to add to their margin rather take that 17-point lead into the second half . A Ferguson pass was intercepted by Greg Buttle , his first of two in the game , and it set up a 26-yard Leahy field goal that cut the score to 24-10 with 13 seconds remaining. // In the third quarter Leahy kicked a 19-yard field goal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 points in the fourth quarter . Joe Cribbs , the Bills ' halfback who had been kept under wraps , suddenly took off on a 45-yard burst down the right sideline for a touchdown . Mike-Mayer ' s conversion made it 31-13 , and only 10 minutes 16 seconds remained . <> <> Todd Completes 9 of 9 // That is when Todd began a stretch of 9 consecutive completions , spanning two touchdown drives. // Midway through the quarter , after another apparent touchdown pass to Walker was dropped , Todd and Bobby Jones teamed up for a 30-yard touchdown . Leahy ' s extra point brought the Jets to 31-20. // The crowd , sensing that something magical could happen if only the Bills could be held to three downs and a punt , screamed " Defense ! " And the defense held , the Bills punted , and the Jets took over with 5 : 43 remaining. // The offensive line , which permitted five sacks of Todd , began to give the quarterback more time . Todd hit Shuler and Gaffney on key pases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long . The extra point brought the Jets to 31-27 with 3 : 44 remaining . And no one took a seat in the stands again . <> <> Final Drive of the Season // Once more the defense forced a quick exchange , giving the Jets the ball with 2 : 36 remaining with the Bills ' goal-line 80 yards away. // Shuler , who was to catch 6 passes for 116 yards , caught one for 29 . Then Bobby Jones caught one for 13 yards with 1 : 59 to play . After a sack of Todd , the Jets faced a third-and-20 , and Todd responded by completing a pass to Gaffney for 26 yards . Then , on a third-and-15 , Todd threw to Walker , but the pass was intercepted . A penalty nullified the inteception and the Jets instead had a first down on the Bills ' 22. // The Jets reached the 11 with 14 seconds remaining . A pass to Shuler was too high . Then came the ill-fated pass to Gaffney . Todd , his left arm in a sling after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have just thrown the ball out-of-bounds . " After Simpson ran it back to the 10 , the Bills took over with 2 seconds remaining . Ferguson dropped to the ground , and the Jets ' season was over and the Bills had their first playoff victory since their days in the old American Football League . They had lost in two previous playoff appearances since the two leagues merged. <> <> 85 Passes to 44 Rushes // Todd had been forced to throw early as the Bills halted the Jets ' running attack . Todd passed 51 times , completing 28 , for 377 yards . The Jets ' leading rusher , Freeman McNeil , gained only 32 yards on 12 carries . For the game , the Jets ran 22 times for 71 yards. // Ferguson also threw on more plays than the Bills ' backs had run . He completed 17 of 34 passes for 268 yards , but had the bigger plays . The Bills ran 22 times for 91 yards , with Cribbs getting 83 of them. // " Very simply , I guess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended it bad , " said Walt Michaels , the coach of the Jets . Like many of the Jets , Marty Lyons , the defensive tackle , had tears in his eyes in the locker room . But he tried to console Mike Hickey , the club ' s personnel director. // " Hey , Mike , it ' s okay . The sun ' s going to shine in the morning , " said Lyons . He sounded as if he wanted to believe it , too. //
