" You have to give everything you ve got to your life " <P> He was exhausted . The pressures on him and the union were becoming unbearable ; martial law , not yet imposed , was only days away . He had been awakened at 4 a.m. by a Solidarity delegation from the city of Radom , which warned him it was going to call a general strike that would affect an important armaments factory . Walesa was furious to find such a strike was being considered , and the men had argued for hours . At breakfast , he made peace with the delegation , which agreed to put off the strike . " lam absolutely finished and run down , " he said later . " I have more problems than the hairs on my head . " Then , in his last major interview before the military takeover , Lech Walesa talked to TIME Correspondent Richard Hornik about his work , his hopes and discouragements , and the forces that drive and sustain him . It was an extraordinarily personal and revealing conversation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. Outwardly you seem to be a religious man . Is that true ? <P> <P> A. Religion is my private affair , and therefore I do n't believe , for example , in holding Mass at Solidarity meetings . Of course , I think that the church should do things for the spirit of man . But Solidarity should see to the body . Solidarity has to do it honestly , justly , and the church has to do the same for the spirit . So , many slogans coming from the church agree with ours , and we can use them , but of course all of us can not be dressed as priests . Somebody has to be in the factory , somebody must commit sins , and somebody must give money to the courts . <P> <P> Q. And that is your role ? <P> <P> A. Sure . Privately I 'm a sinning believer . As any other man , I have my faults and my weaknesses . But I am a believer , and I practice my religion . And I fall down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences of the past eleven years had an impact on your private religion ? <P> <P> A. Of course . I would not make it through this struggle if I were not a believer . I had more than one very comfortable proposition offered to me by the government . I did not accept them because I preferred to struggle for my cause . <P> Of course , I do go to church quite often . There I gather my spirits together , and there I think : yeah , there were great men in Poland once , but today there are n't any . I 'm a little guy , though some people think that I am great . But nobody will tell me I was a swine in my day . Nobody will ever spit at my children . Therefore I will persevere . And the church helps me in this . Without it , I would drop on my face and die , because I am very tired . I think every man needs at least half an hour per week in church to look at what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U-turn ? Is there still enough time to retreat ? A man needs this moment of stopping and paying some attention to himself . <P> <P> Q. But is n't that more like meditation than a spiritual experience ? <P>
