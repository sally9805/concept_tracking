( Lights dim . Taped music of " Greensleeves " offstage . ) Dear Della-Fella , May I call you Della-Fella ? You think that 's an irrelevant question , do n't you ? Well , do n't you ? You middle-class babe in the woods . Wow ! Here I go again , and I wanted to get off on the right side of the sack with you . Dig ? All kidding aside , I spoke to our mutal friend Ronnie some weeks ago and he said you look insane . Hey , Della-Fella , when you decided to walk out on me twenty years ago because I was too much of an artist for the likes of a bourgeois cunt like you really are  --  even though you conned a lot of members of the ear-wax generation into believing you might be an artist  --  did you ever dream that I 'd end up here in this neck of the woods ? Living with my 85-year-old mother in a rotting pre-Revolutionary house in a remote part of upstate New York ? Hey , wow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got old Ma her breakfast . Yeah , Ma was having her bacon and eggs and Sonny-boy was taking his first snort . Then my dog Freddy took a leak on the laundry that I brought back spanking clean from the laundromat . Ma 's gon na yell bloody murder when she smells her sheets . And yesterday morning I went to my new employer to ask for an advance on my salary and the mean bitch turned me down because I already owe her fifty bucks . She told me she 's going to call the cops if I continue to bother her . Bother her ? Shit ! Well , fuck it ! Tomorrow 's a new day and I 'm going to renovate this beautiful old church in town  --  I asked them if I could  --  incredible stained-glass windows  --  like the rose window at Chartres . Remember ? Sometimes I start thinking of when I was seven years old sitting on my grandmother 's porch in Michigan , holding a glass of cold water and a chocolate nut cookie  --  and then I think of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mid-West alive ? Anyway , back at the ranch , guffaw , guffaw ! I mean I seriously am going to renovate this gothicstyle church . Hey , why do n't you ever call me up ? I gave you my phone number . Tell Whatsis Face that he 's welcome to read my novel also . Did I ever tell you that I had this beautiful parrot that could whistle and some bastard shot him ? And did I ever tell you that Sally , the girl I married after you , Della-Fella , had a baby by an East Indian and the baby 's rear-end was covered with black spots ? Wow ! I used to be able to fuck a lot . Ha ! Marie , the waitress , says I 'm the only middle-aged adolescent she knows . I 'm going to be fifty soon , and my teeth are rotting away . Heaven help me . Your faithful friend , Chucky . P.S. Please excuse my rudeness . I got carried away . I really would like some contact and to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . C.C. ( Lights dim . Taped music of Italian madrigals offstage . Then , lights up . ) Dear Della-Fella , See what you made me do ? Yeah , you did it , kiddo . Anybody ever tell you about yourself  --  like I did ?  --  literally uncorking that dumb little housewife 's mind that 's stuck somewhere between your ears ? Put that in your pipe and smoke it ! Dig ? I 'm sitting here now  --  after scolding the puppies for teasing Freddy  --  named after the famous and important Freddy Held who made it big in the New York art scene . Freddy Held , yeah . How could a boy like me and from the mid-West ever compete with the biggies from the city . Oops , there I go again digressing  --  Ma says that I 'm the most digressing person she 's ever seen  --  and she ought to know after all the times we 've digressed each other . But you know my story , dear Elly . I could tell Whatsis Face much more easily than I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are part of the problem . Forget the Freudian chicken soup  --  you refugee from Brooklyn ! The trouble is I know whatever Chucky wants Chucky gets  --  I also know the real trouble is that Chucky does n't always know what he wants . After you and I split up  --  when I was with my third wife , Sally , in 1961 , I went into the antique business . Yeah , I knew that would make you laugh  --  but I had a little antique shop  --  and then everything started to fall apart  --  I mean the bottom of my life was starting to drop out  --  maybe I 'm too nervous ! Shucks , look what you got me doing  --  complaining about the conditions of my life . Now do n't tell me to see a shrink because I tried it . It did n't work ! I know , my perceptions at times are completely messed up . But not nearly as messed up and rotten as yours must be  --  No ! No ! No ! I refuse to let you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care about what happens to your fellow human beings in this world which is part of the cosmos . You ought to because it is your responsibility to ! My mother 's legs are mapped all over with varicose veins and she 's a dope addict . What difference does it make because she 's 85 ? Are you saying that ? Well , when I look in the mirror I see someone I do n't recognize who gets mad at his mother for growing too old to care anymore about her legs , or even having din-din in a little restaurant . Oh , how incorrigible I yam , I yam . Yeah . But just remember I was more intelligent than you ! I WAS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU ! Boy , I got you worked up . This time I really got a rise outta you . Listen , between the phonies of the big shitty , yeah New York is the big shitty . Heh , heh , heh . Anyway between the phonies  --  I repeat the phonies of the art world scene and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out alive ! Remember Della-Fella , if I wanted to suck seed , yeah , suck seed  --  I could have  --  but I did n't want to . Listen dearie , drop me a line or two . I 'm sure we can communicate  --  maybe we can even meet in a hotel room somewhere and finally fight it out . Remember the mosaic that I did over twenty years ago ? The knight with his lovely lady . He was playing the lute  --  and she sat there next to him  --  with an empty smile . Your American Artist . Charles . ( Lights dim . Taped music of jazz . Music stops . Lights up . ) Dear Elly , In spite of your winning the lottery ticket , you 're a failure ! You and I are both failures . Do you dig it ? And so is Ma . You know what happened to her today ? She slipped in the bathtub and fell down real hard on her ass  --  she accused me of pushing her ! I was only trying to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be bombed like Con Edison was in the 60s . Actually , Con Edison was never bombed , but there was this sore loser who had a grudge and intended to bomb Con Ed . My grudge is against the phone company . Hey , what do you think of a person who makes crank calls ? Do you think he 's crazy ? Do you think that individual has a grudge against somebody ? Hey , Della-Fella , how come you never had a kid ? Where have all the children gone , long time passing . . . ? You remember in 1958 when I was interviewed by that young twerp from the Columbia School of Journalism and he suspected that I was of a rebellious nature . And he told me , " We ca n't afford to have defiant characters in our midst . " Hey , Della , did you think that I was a defiant character ? I was really too much for you , was n't I ? From the very first day that I met you when I told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of me as the sonovabitch in your life . But at least you came close to knowing a real artist . I 'm sure about certain things . In the same way that the French Impressionists knew that the emphasis on the quality of light would separate them from the meat and brown gravy of the traditionalist school . From Rembrandt . It 's in my book . It 's all in my book . I want to send you my book because you 're in it too . It 's about you , Della . The book 's about you . Do you remember my old hernia operation ? The fissure that I have on my side ? It still oozes sometimes . My old hernia trouble . It sounds like a song . God what a disgusting mess I yam , I yam . But I still get horny . The other night I took a package of beef kidneys that were supposed to be for the cats , yup , we have two of them running around . I let the kidneys get at room temperature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow managed to work myself up into a state of sexual desire  --  and came into the kidneys . Pretty depraved , right ? Do you remember during the fifties you used to wear your dark red lipstick over your lipline , a fat round arc that glistened  --  you were stacked like a brick shithouse . You were my foot-stool , Elly . I just had an image of you eating with your head bent way over close to the kitchen table , without your eyeglasses you were almost blind . It took guts and patience for you to get used to the contact lenses that I bought for you . Please try to show a little gratitude . Your faithful former husband , Chucky . ( Lights dim . Taped music of jazz . Music stops . Black-out . ) Dear Elly , You ole rubber hammer , you . I 'm sorry for coming on strong . Forgive Chucky . It 's a deal ? Cool . I 'll start again more politely . Dear Della . Last night Ma began her usual lecture , that is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can sure bug a man . Anyway , she began as always , stressing the two most important qualities a civilized human being must have : A sound mind in a sound body . Well , can you believe it ? I have to help her in and out of the tub and wash her feet for her and she keeps up that damn song and dance about a sound mind in a sound body and how I ought to get myself together . At night , Elly , those reptile age fears come to me . Anyway , Ma and I did sit down together for a talk about the good old days when I would eat a whole head of lettuce all by myself at the age of twelve . And then the tale about the time a man tried to get into the house when Ma left me there alone . He was a genuine mid-Western pervert who probably wanted to assfuck a young boy and then cut his throat . Ma and I hugged each other real close after that story  --  we might have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to Chucky . So what if my brain has turned to egg white . ( Lights up . ) I 'm still able to take a leak and make a phone call every so often . Why do n't you answer , Della ? What 's the matter with you ? Do you have cancer ? How do you pay your food bills , Della ? I 'd like to hear you whisper in my ear and say " Hello , Chucky . " I was bitten by a woman who turned into a mean green-head fly by the name of Della . Sometimes folks around here see me walking along the road with the moonlight in my hair , carrying a sawed-off shot gun . Guess who I want to find , dear woman ? Peggy Guggenheim . Parasite , that 's what she is  --  just a parasitic douche-bag . Hell , I 'll never send her one of my bird-feeder constructions . Nope , Peggy 's never gon na get a birdfeeder from Chucky , Only lucky Della-Fella will . Dig ? I should answer my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaking roof . He 's ringing away and Ma 's screaming bloody murder because I wo n't let him in the house . She thinks I was traumatized by the memory of the pervert from years back . Traumatized ? Me . Never ! The only thing that ever really got me down was the suicides of all our friends . Especially our dear mutual friend , Eugene Ruggles . Well , you can be sure his wife never knew Genie 's whereabouts that night . My , oh my , do n't I sound like some suburban housewife ? I do n't mean to be rude , of course , of course . I introduced you to the music of Bach , never forget that kid , you ole rat , you . You were just an unformed baby when I met you . I created you  --  you Frankenstein monster ! Now , I 'm the only one who listens to me . I 'm a troubador poet . What a fucking place America is . I should have won a Prix de Rome or a Guggenheim . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming at me to let him in , but I wo n't . Chucky is not taking any chances , at least not yet . When I answer the door I 'm going to have a brick in my hand . How about you , Della , do you keep a brick in your hand when the doorbell rings ? Chucky . ( Lights dim . Taped music of Elvis Presley , " Blue Suede Shoes . " Music stops . ) Dear Lying Eyes , How 's that for a title of a book I 'm going to write ? " Dear Lying Eyes . " You know the trouble with you is you wo n't answer any of my letters . What 's the matter  --  are your fingers too greasy to hold a pen ? I bet you 've become a woman 's libber since I went out of your life , Della . But we can always talk about it if you want in some low-down hotel room . How 's about it , Della ? I 'm great at pre-chewing food if that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . I do it for Ma . Yup , the woman 's bridge broke last week because I accidently smacked her in the mouth with my big carpenter 's hand and so I thought that I ought to help her eat by chewing the goddamn food for her so that she can get some nourishment in her . And there 's more of an emotional connection chewing up the food than using an automatic blender . Eskimo mothers do it for their kids . I thought I 'd try it . How 's that for a boy 's devotion ? Ma does n't mind . She just looks at me while swallowing what Chucky , gives her . I just remembered a little incident years and years ago , in 1960 . You and I were strolling along in the Village one sweet summer night , heading for the San Remo , and a bum asked me for some change and for one reason or another , probably because the sonovabitch was too aggressive , I did n't give him anything and he got bittershit and bawled at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a woman ! You got a woman ! " Talk about middle-class values . The fucker thought I should give him some money because I had a woman . Do n't put me down , Della . I can still show you a thing or two . The magic christian is still as beautiful as Michelangelo 's David . Ma showed me a recipe for chili . I 'm going to try it tomorrow . When I put my mind to it I can do anything . After all the suffering Ma has had in her life , to think that her only child , her son , would end up this way . But here I am going off again like a roach out of a crack in the wall . I should cut out the cigarettes , it 's making what teeth I have left a very obnoxious green . You used to have strong teeth , Della , big like a horse 's . I can visualize you with your big teeth , smiling broadly at me , laughing your head off the way you always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew you . This is for you , Della-Fella . Ma has a bad cough that 's not getting better . She insists on smoking up a storm . It 's a wonder that she has n't died of T.B . or cancer . Hah ! She 'll probably outlive me . Women with their sexual organs are the stronger sex . Dig ? I 'm pretty sure Ma still gets horny . I know what I 'm talking about . And me ? I feel like I 'm doing myself in but I do n't want to do this shitty world any favors  --  not just yet anyway . Your immortal artist , Charles Craydon . P.S. Elly , when you left me over twenty years ago I bet that you took the big hand-knit Christmas stocking that Ma made to remind you of the old days . I 'd like to fill that stocking up with oranges and bars of chocolate and best wishes from your good fairy , Chucky . ( Lights dim . Taped voice resembling that of a news broadcaster. ) p. 3 TAPED VOICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years . Spawned in the woods near Apple Valley , New York , they were a symbiotic entity , cunning , vicious , frightening , above all pragmatic during a killing . In judging this unique duo who liked to play games in the moist muddy furrows near the pond , one had to understand and accept the fantastic attraction the two had for each other ; it was something special , ever since the members of their different species had rejected and thrown them out of the home territory for obscure reasons that affront and mock those who hold to current scientific opinion about the unlikelihood of wild animals from different genres forming alliances . This was an extraordinary pair , intelligent and prospering . During that first incredible encounter , the porcupine had dropped seventeen quills to the earth in fright because she had believed that the snake was going to sting her to death . He wanted only to touch her where there were no quills , to rub his length along her voluptuous roundness . With inscrutable thoroughness they smelled each other ravenously . The seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new wonder of the senses that they had never known before . Together they were rich and glorious , mating , mating always , gasping and hissing in an attempt to beget progeny , meeting each other 's opaque gaze in their mutual trance of copulation . The snake and the porcupine did not fear man as the members of their respective species did , although they knew that man caused trouble to the creatures that lived in their midst . There is no more reason to give credence to one theory than to the other  --  as to why they did n't fear humans , or why they became a couple . One of the most dramatic fights that they had shared together was when they had seized a large husky and began to chew its head and neck so violently that the victim thrashed about wildly in an effort to escape . After the struggling had ended , the pair spent an hour swallowing their prey . All the while a man watched from a nearby bush , showing curiosity and agitation . When the pair made especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to peer through the bush at the fascinating spectacle . After the meal the couple did a slipping and skidding and zigzagging dance that slowly progressed into copulation . ( Taped music : West Indian Steel Guitars . ) Dear Elly , I think that yours truly got a bum rap . Not only is Ma complaining more loudly than usual about how bad it is to be old without any grandchildren to make jam and bake cookies for , but also that her very own magic christian son is such a god-awful loser . Yup , one of life 's real losers , I yam , I yam . The saddest thing I have to report to you is that my husky , a great big gorgeous animal , kind of like I was when I was twenty , my Freddy , was murdered and eaten in cold blood by the weirdest twosome I 've ever seen collaborating in a killing . Yup . A snake and a porcupine ganged up on Freddy my dog and killed him . I saw it with my own eyes . I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by throwing a rock or something  --  because my hernia was acting up and I felt awful . And I was in much too weak a condition to defend myself . Anyway , I cried like a baby all night thinking about what happened to my husky.Ma could n't say a word to me without my biting her head off . See , I blame her for my hernia because of the Jehovah Witness phase that she went through when I was fifteen , that forbade her to allow me to undergo surgery for my hernia . A simple operation then could have cured me of the damn thing , but Ma 's religious scruples prevented me from having it . Is it any wonder that I suffer emotionally as well as sometimes oozing from the fissure in my side from the operation I was forced to have later ? Ma 's been having grimy thoughts lately  --  been confiding to me how she has sexual urges and at her age . Eighty-five , God bless her . Says that if only she could meet some nice gentleman at a church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she 's feeling perky some Sundays . But why should I please her when she would n't let me have the hernia operation when I was fifteen ? That year when the other boys in the locker room at school found out about my wearing a truss . She could have spared me the pain and embarrassment of the boys ' ridicule . I originally wanted to tell you about my dog Freddy 's death but I got sidetracked as usual . But do you know any old man who might like to get it on with my mom ? He does n't even have to be a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant . But , I 'd better check out her preference first . Ma 's still choosy even after having given birth to a snake-in-the-grass like Chucky . Somehow I always felt that I deserved a better name than loser in my life . I mean I had more options than you twenty years ago . I was the one with the superior intelligence and the physical strength . I was the artist and you were just a pretender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right rubber hammer ? How many men have you chewed up , you fat spider ? Sign off , bug off , fuck off , jerk off . Chucky . ( Lights dim . Taped music of " Stormy Weather . ) Dear Lost Wonder , I 'm in a slightly gentler state of mind today . Ma did it ! Yup . She 's got a companion , a boyfriend . No . I 'm not kidding . It 's true as pimples on a teenaged girl 's derriere . Remember when I told you about Ma wanting a male friend who she could ha , ha , relate to ? You know what I mean , Elly , somebody who she could rub her muddy ole body on and maybe chew a thumb or two . Anyway , lemme tell thee what 's transpired since . Gee , I feel like I 'm telling a fragment of a medieval saga . Here goes . Last Sunday morning , when I went back to the house after dropping Ma off at church , there was a fog over the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call Jack-in-the- mist . All of a sudden something flashed in my brain . It came to me that something extraordinary was happening that exact moment to Ma right in church . I had this feeling that Ma was very happy at that very moment . Oh , I 've had these hunches before . When we were married , I had a hunch the day after we exchanged vows that you were going to leave me . You did leave me too . You cunt . You could n't stand the fact of being married to an artist . But it 's cool . I forgive you kid . Shit I 'm digressing from my story about Ma and the old man who maybe I 'll be calling Pop one of these days . His name is Chester Nickerson and he 's 82-years-old , but if he told you he was sixty-five you 'd believe the son-of-a-gun . He 's a retired gentleman , to use Ma 's words , and he has several children and nine grandchildren , also a nephew who publishes a national magazine . Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you the truth , I 'm trying to share her happiness . You should see her when she 's preparing tea for the two of them , Ma calls it high tea because she serves crumpets in the English manner . She asks me to join them but I know when I 'm not wanted  --  the old bugger is trying to get into Ma 's pants . Heh , heh  --  so I just wander off and leave the two of them alone , but my imagination starts to work overtime and I feel terribly confused because I know Ma does n't have too many years left and her legs are bad , the old man could n't care less about Ma 's legs looking like broken sausages or all the medication she takes that I 'm sure makes her feel horny . Geezus ! My brain is popping with pictures , hey , that 's a good expression , is n't it ? Yeah , my brain is popping with pictures of Ma and Chester Nickerson getting it off together . I know what you 're thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their age but that 's not true , a person could keep having sex until deep into old age . Why , I expect to make it with room-temperature beef kidneys until I 'm fifty-five . Why fifty-five ? Because frankly I do n't know how much longer I can go on this way , being drunk almost every day , my inability to hold down a job and the affections of my beloved Ma being stolen from me by this dirty old man called Chester Nickerson . And last , but not least , the murder of my dog Freddy . God I miss him so . In a way Freddy was just like a little child , my son , and Ma 's grandchild . Do n't laugh at my sadness , Elly . God will judge you . Your faithful , Chucky . ( Lights dim . Taped music of Tango . ) Dear Della , What is happening to me right now is like out of an X-rated film ; I 'm sure of it as I 'm sure of my own name " Chucky Craydon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ma and Chester Nickerson , her 82-year-old lover . Yup . It happened yesterday morning when he arrived at the house with his flowers for another one of his long chats with Ma . I decided to join them at tea . During their conversation about politics he began to look in my direction , a kind of weird stare , and then he 'd look at Ma and I could see at once that there was an alliance between them against me . Then out of the blue he announces that the speedometer on his car reads exactly 69,696.9 miles and that was a good number to dwell on and then after saying this nutty statement Ma looks at me with her chin trembling a little and tells me why do n't I go into town for the newspaper . I had already made a trip to the dump and I felt like lounging around a little in my own home ! Dig ? Yes , I know the house is in Ma 's name but after her death it 's mine ! But the way my blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably go first . Anyway , to get back to the point , I tell the both of them that I know they want to be alone and I 'll leave to do some work on my new bird-feeder constructions that I 've been making . You ought to see them Elly , they 're beautiful . Well , I worked a half hour on the bird-feeder constructions and then I thought I 'd just slip around to the back of the house outside Ma 's bedroom where she and Chester Nickerson are and I 'm peering through the gap between the windowshade and the sill and I see that Chester is in the middle of sticking the pink and purple wildflowers that he likes to bring to Ma into her bun on the nape of her neck and Ma is laughing and fiddling around with the zipper of his fly , pulling it up and down in a playful way and then Ma puts her hand all the way in so that it appears that the hand is cut off at the wrist and Chester is sticking his tongue into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pants and while still in his boxer shorts that are almost to his knees he pulls up Ma 's flowered housedress so that she 's sort of trapped temporarily in the armholes and then Chester is unlacing Ma 's corset and her breasts which still look , I swear Elly , almost like a woman in her forties , were free for Chester to fondle . I was stunned ! I could hardly believe my own eyes when I saw what went on between them . Ma sucking Chester 's soft gray dick until it grew hard and then Ma sitting right smack on Chester 's face , pulling at his hands with her arthritic fingers , clutching at his wrists while making low groans in the back of her throat . I admit that though I was jealous at what those two had between them , I was also furious and I just hoped Ma would n't die of heart failure , or for that matter , Chester . I almost burst out laughing when I saw Ma stick the rim of a small vial of perfume into Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques ? I wonder that sometimes . They started to fuck with Ma on the edge of the bed and Chester standing in front of her . By that time the noise of their gasping was beginning to sound terribly loud and scary in my own ears and my anxiety was becoming more than I could bear and all I could think of was a glass of cold water and a chocolate nut cookie and being seven years old again . But then I had an image of burning the house down with them inside . And all I wanted really was to get very drunk and be with my dog Freddy who I miss more than this world can ever know . We gave away the puppies and now all I have left is the memory of Freddy . My mother wishes I were dead so that she and Chester Nickerson can be alone together for their remaining years . The feeling around my heart is one of constant pain . The booze offers me some relief but it 's all false , just like the values of this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Freddy . I 'm going to find and hunt down the deadly duo that took his life . Soon , my quest begins . Until later , Chucky . P.S. Did you know that Ma got a job a month ago stuffing envelopes and I think she 's made about $1,000 from an outfit in Daytona Beach , Florida . But I have n't seen one red cent of it . Still another reason that feeds my anger against Chester Nickerson  --  I bet she gives him the money . ( Lights up . Chucky is sleeping , head folded in arms . He awakens and sits looking out at audience . Face in shadow . A very deep woman 's voice offstage . Taped. ) p. 4 WOMAN 'S VOICE Dear Elly , It has been so many years since any sort of correspondence between us , although I did write you a letter about seven years ago which was returned to me for reasons of change of address . Luckily , I was able to get your present whereabouts from the newspapers . I am very happy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lottery . Chucky had mentioned it to me , the fact of your luck . This letter that I am in the midst of writing contains some important information that I think you ought to know . My son Chucky has disappeared and there are no available answers to where he has gone or if he is even alive this very day . I know that the fact that you were married to him so many years ago , over twenty to be exact , might lead you to the conclusion that this unhappy circumstances is not your concern , the unhappy circumstance being the disappearance . If you ca n't follow my line of reasoning , it is because there is no rhyme or reason or constant , orderly line to human life without spiritual convictions . Those smart alecks who are against prayer in the schools are in the upper echelons of the communist party . Anyway back to the premise of my letter and the nitty gritty facts  --  about two weeks ago Chucky took off about eleven in the morning , it was a Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refuse removal . We had a huge load of Readers ' Digests and old Life magazines dating back to the early fifties , but Chucky could n't stand the sight of the piles of magazines and papers . I 'm certain he got that impatient streak from his father George plus his predilection for drinking . At any rate , since July 5th we have not seen hide nor hair of him . Needless to say I miss my boy very much and lately my mind is filled with memories that only an old woman 's mind can be filled with . Memories of when I was a young mother-to-be . I remember distinctly the desire to have a normal child and so I made sure that as soon as I found out I was pregnant , I would never wear a tight leather belt again that pressed my waist in ; now I know , Elly , you always wore tight belts and I 'm sure that is why you lost your baby when you were married to Chucky . But these days I think it was definitely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm convinced that the reason for his terrible disturbances are due to the bad genes that he inherited from his father George whom I had to leave because I knew that he would be dangerous to Chucky sooner or later . Oh , I was both mother and father to Chucky as you so well know and as you so well know I would if I had to have gone down on my hands and knees to scrub floors for his college education  --  fortunately I had a good job as an occupational therapist . I sometimes wonder when I look at the old photograph album of Chucky when he was a child , there are so many pictures of him and me together , why did the misfortunes happen to us ? Not you , Elly , you 've been doing well over the years . Oh , I know everybody has their troubles but Chucky had a college education . He was such a handsome young man with his dreams about being an artist . Last week was my birthday and Chucky 's too . It was a miraculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same date . My birthday was pleasant though , I was fortunate to have spent the day with a kind and good friend who I met at church some time ago . A gentleman by the name of Chester Nickerson . He is a widower and is quite serious about remarrying . Chester is eighty-two and in perfect health . We are both of the same Protestant denomination and so forth . He has a whole lot of youthful ideas and can show a man much younger than himself a thing or two about romancing a woman . Chester has a nephew who is a publisher of a nationally known magazine and it is also sold in Europe . They have a fold-out page in each issue and Chester thinks it would be the cat 's meow if photos of both him and me were taken in some elegantly refined poses displaying natural love . Of course he 's joking but who knows , I can not see the harm in decent photos of us together . Oh , dear me ! I must tell you this information about Chucky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do  --  several days after Chucky 's dog Freddy was killed , supposedly by a snake and a porcupine , Chucky kept talking on and on about how he was going to get the " deadly duo " who had taken the life of Freddy . The police and Chester and I theorize that he probably decided to try to find and hunt down the alleged killers of Freddy . They have even put bloodhounds on his trail but have come up with nothing . I 'm worried sick over the whole business of Chucky but I 've still got to think of practical affairs , like contacting the town refuse dumping service to come and collect my garbage once a week . Chucky used to do that for us  --  load up all the refuse in the car and take it to the dump . When he 'd return I 'd always ask him about the magpies and how many there were that day lunching at the dump . The idea of all those birds eating there at the dump just tickled me . Well , I must sign off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . Sincerely yours , Marge Craydon . P.S. There was a special prayer service for Chucky offered up by the congregation of the church last Sunday . How I hope all our prayers will be answered and that he will return home safe and sound . Because no corpse has been discovered the police have given up the search and have come to believe that he might have left the area . ( Lights dim . Taped Japanese non-vocal music . Lights up . ) Dear Snap-hole , Della-Fella , If you took a poll and you dressed up in a black suit , a man 's suit that is , you could call yourself Mr. Death . Because like I 've told you before and in so many ways  --  you know all the answers , Elly . So then tell me how I ever found myself in this neck o ' the woods . Listen to me , Elly , and like Ishmael I 'm going to relate a tale to ye in as high-pitched a decibel as I can make  --  but like a bat or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been happening to yours truly these past few weeks . For example  --  what actually was I doing lurking around unfamiliar territory in the first place ? Sure I was hunting down the murderers of Freddy  --  that was my objective . But did I ever consider that I might have experienced an extraordinary phenomenon  --  and not any mystical bullshit either . Oh come on , Elly , you know what I mean . Do n't laugh , I feel  --  innocent ! Yeah , innocent but still the same old nose-thumber as I always have been  --  and still subject to sexual impulses of a highly erotic nature . Like right now , I 'm visualizing you , Elly , wearing high spike heels , your face flushed , erected nipples peeking through your fuzzy angora sweater . Do you know that there are creatures evolving this very second from out of the forest primeval , rodent-like and five-toed with long thick tails , descendants of the saber-toothed tiger ? Elly , did you know that Queen Elizabeth the first had a neck shaped like an otter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different and subtle colors of a sea-slug and a squid  --  then you 'd know that I 'm still very much an artist . You might think otherwise  --  that I 'm a lunatic . But if I 'm a lunatic , Elly , then the president of the United States is a nameless hybrid , a pile of mouse turd . The way the government is treating the people  --  I 'm amazed that the masses have n't risen up in armed revolt ! I sound like a communist , do n't I ? You know , Elly , during the McCarthy era  --  I helped petition against the asshole . Ah , that 's another story . Sometimes , I feel like I 've been around since the birth of Christ . At this moment I 'm gazing at my sharpened ax , it gleams in the moonlight  --  in a little while I 'm going to follow the scent that keeps drifting to my nostrils , the scent of cotton-tailed rabbit and squirrel which is what I nurture my body on these days , plus some cheap whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then . There 's a Holiday Inn not too far from where I am and you ca n't imagine the things they put in the garbage . It makes you wonder about the kind of people at a Holiday Inn . At night while prowling around I 'm aware of tremendous energy , it 's during the day that I 'm ravaged and exhausted in body and soul  --  where everywhere I stand is enemy territory  --  when I flail at the air and let regret wash over me like mud from the river . But Elly , I 'm as curious as ever , more curious than a cat or a puppy and for complex reasons these parts of upstate New York fascinate me and there are nights when my wanderings have a clear and urgent purpose as if I 'm going to find something or someone that is necessary to the continuation of my being . Your friend , Chucky . ( Taped Japanese non-vocal music . ) Dear Above Average Woman , Yeah , you are  --  you know it too . You like the idea also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm here under the rocks with the bugs  --  being watched by the dragons and owls of hysterical imagination . Elly , if I 've seen a weird thing  --  I mean something really weird  --  I might just chalk it up to being loaded or whatever , but if I see the weird thing again and again , well then I possibly might be correct in my perceptions . Right ? Right . You know about the Holiday Inn , well , there are some very peculiar goings-on there , Shift  --  I want to tell it exactly how I remember . One twilight after I had rescued a nestful of birds from a coupla cats  --  I heard a din coming from the swimming pool at the Holiday Inn  --  so I took a look and it turned out to be a gaggle of kids of about twelve  --  they were riding bicycles around in circles  --  horsing around the way kids do . I noticed a very lively one who had make-up on his eyes and a leather studded wrist band . He was really a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get close to a kid like that . Get your mind out of the gutter , Elly . You know that 's not my scene . Anyway , I wanted to run off with the tyke and teach him the ways of an Indian scout  --  to be silent for hours on end and wait for the fish to bite . And then I saw the kid 's father , a bearded guy who wore funny leather pouches snapped to his belt . He was with a dwarf who was wearing yellow loafers . All of a sudden I hear a voice yelling , " Laszlo , " and the dwarf turns his big head to look up toward the balcony where the voice is coming from . And standing up on the balcony is an old man  --  and it 's none other than Chester Nickerson . Well , you can imagine what I was feeling at that moment , Elly . But that was n't the biggest surprise . Oh , no . Because I saw my mom step out on the balcony and she was holding a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was wearing a red and yellow gown , and she was smiling . She looked terrific , Elly . I felt my armpits begin to itch . I controlled myself and refrained from screaming bloody murder . Then I see Ma rest her hand on the back of Chester 's neck and then he turned to kiss her wrist . I felt as if someone had poured concrete down my throat . I could n't stand it another minute . I ran away from the Holiday Inn . I went deep into the woods . I felt so wrong in the scheme of things . Do you know , Elly , that the sun is my enemy  --  a great ball of fire that pours out its hate . I need a colder climate like the Arctic tundra . I used to wonder why the bloodhounds had n't picked up my scent . I used to wonder that  --  but now I know . I 'm wasted  --  and the dogs have given up on me . Elly , it 's true . And you 're so fucking indestructible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to inherit my piece of the earth . The Rebel , Charles Craydon . ( Lights dim . Taped music of Italian madrigals . Time passes . ) Elly , I have an image of you in my mind , poking like a finger under my eyelids . You 're standing next to a vase filled with wildflowers . My ego is growing claws that are ready to tear off a piece of whatever I can get them into . There is no pattern to my life that you can understand , Elly . I have a hunch , you 'll find yourself basking in the sun with me one of these days  --  but the odds are against it . You 'll most likely die in a mental institution at a ripe old age . What do you think of when you look at the old photographs of us together ? Do you feel as though you walked away from a head-on collision ? I talk to you  --  you refuse to understand . I loved the way you moved your body  --  and not once have I pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down slowly. )
