How the Salvadoran rebels order outside help for their revolution <P> In the debate over U.S. policy in Central America , one of the Reagan Administration 's biggest problems has been to make a successful case that there is any kind of superpower meddling in the stricken region-any meddling , that is , aside from its own . Congressmen have leaped quickly upon the Administration 's barely concealed support for the guerrilla warfare of disaffected rebels against the Marxist-led Sandinista government of Nicaragua . Legislators have been unwilling to accept Reagan 's oft-repeated assertion that the four-year-old insurgency in El Salvador is covertly sponsored by the Soviet Union and its revolution-oriented client states . <P> From sources in Washington and Central America , TIME has pieced together many aspects of the nature of the Marxist-Leninist interference in El Salvador that worries Washington . The picture that emerges is of a sophisticated strategy that takes advantage of the region 's terrain and circumstances , and , above all , of the weaknesses of the U.S.-backed Salvadoran forces . The guerrillas , says a Washington-based intelligence analyst , " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho Chi Minh trails this time . " <P> According to a Sandinista military defector interviewed by TIME , the building of a Nicaraguan arms link to El Salvador began almost as soon as the victorious revolutionaries took power in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua in July 1979 . Says the defector : " It took nine months to plan the operation . The arms that eventually went to El Salvador were first taken from our forces who fought against Nicaraguan Dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle . After the triumph , they were instructed to turn in their weapons , which were put in warehouses and held for shipment to El Salvador . Then it was discussed who would take them there . It was decided that the organization to run this was Sandinista military intelligence . As former guerrillas , we knew that different routes could be used to make it difficult to prove that this was happening . We studied the environmental and human factors to determine the possibility of the mission 's success . " <P> According to the defector , arms were secreted in trailer trucks with dummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Salvador . Some of those runs were detected . In 1981 the Reagan Administration displayed photographs of such a truck containing a cache of U.S.-made M-16 rifles in its false bottom . The serial numbers on some of the rifles showed that the weapons had been left behind by U.S. forces in Viet Nam . <P> Soon after the early Nicaraguan smuggling operations into El Salvador , Washington began trying to document Marxist-Leninist interference in that country . In February 1981 the Reagan Administration sent a white paper to its West European and Latin American allies , concluding that the Salvadoran civil war had been " transformed into a textbook case of indirect aggression by Communist powers .
