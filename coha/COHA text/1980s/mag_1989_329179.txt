It is a busy time for justice . Chicago commodity traders indicted for cheating the public . . . Leona Helmsley facing 20 years in a Holiday Inn ( the logical sentence ) if convicted of tax fraud  --  it 's hard not to be interested in these cases , but equally hard to have any impact on their outcome . How refreshing , then , to hear of a case , however small , in which one of us  --  specifically , my pal Joey  --  gets to be judge and jury . This is the story of Joey 's revenge . It could save you a few bucks , or perhaps even earn you a first-class upgrade . <P> The crime , as Joey sees it , is the way some banks try to trick their customers . " Look at this ! " he 'll occasionally shout at me over the phone , as if I could see the checks he 's waving . " They look just like regular checks ! They 've got my name and address preprinted on them , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So ? " I ask . <P> " So  --  but they come from the bank that issues my credit card , and it 's my credit card account number at the bottom of the check ! " " So ? " I ask . <P> " So  --  well they give you this big friendly pitch about how you can use the checks for anything , like to pay the electrician or to pay tuition ! " " So ? " I ask . ( I too think these checks are a minor scandal , but I like to hear Joey get worked up . ) <P> " So what they do n't tell you in their letter , or they tell you only in fine print someplace , is that from the minute you use one of these checks they start charging you 19.8% interest . " " Yes ? " I ask . <P> " And not just on the check you wrote , on the rest of your charges too . " <P> Some banks , Joey thinks , use these checks as a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full and accrue no interest charges , into starting the meter running . <P> " Joey , every time you get checks like these you call me . This is an old story . " <P> " Ah , " he said in a hushed , conspiratorial tone . " But this time I got them back . " <P> It seems this particular set of checks came from Joey 's Pan Am-affiliated MasterCard . It 's one of the many airline-affiliated Visas or MasterCards that give you a frequent-flyer mile free for every dollar you charge , even if you pay your balance in full within the grace period . To a frequent-flyer junkie , these cards are irresistible . <P> " First , " said Joey , " I called to be sure I 'd really get frequent-flyer mileage if I used these checks . ( ( Usually with the checks you do n't . ) ) They said yes . Then I made sure my account balance was zero : I paid all my outstanding charges and quit using the card . ( ( He switched to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the checks they sent me , made it out to myself for $10,000 and deposited it in my bank . So I was borrowing $10,000 from MasterCard . ( ( He has a big credit line . ) ) But at the same time , I sent MasterCard a real check for $10,000 . " A couple of days later , three things happened : <P>  --  MasterCard 's computer started licking its chops when it saw Joey had used one of his checks to borrow $10,000 . <P>  --  MasterCard 's computer then saw the $10,000 payment , so MasterCard could n't start charging him interest . <P>  --  MasterCard 's computer awarded Joey 10,000 Pan Am frequent-flyer miles .
