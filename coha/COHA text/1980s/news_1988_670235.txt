Hachette S.A. agreed to acquire Grolier Inc. for about $450 million , apparently succeeding in its monthlong bid for the Danbury , Conn. - based publisher . Under terms of the merger agreement , CITH Acquisition Co. , a wholly owned subsidiary of Hachette , the Paris-based international publishing company , will acquire all of Grolier ' s common stock outstanding for $24. 25 a share . As part of the pact , Grolier also granted Hachette the right to acquire unissued Grolier common stock equal to 18. 5% of the shares outstanding , a lockup option designed to discourage other bidders . Grolier earlier had rejected as " inadequate " Hachette ' s initial offer of $21-a-share , launched March 13 . On March 31 , Hachette sweetened its offer to $24 a share . That offer was scheduled to expire at 12 : 01 a. m . EDT Friday unless extended . Grolier , which publishes encyclopedias and reference books including the Encyclopedia Americana and the New Book of Knowledge , last year earned $22. 1 million , or $1. 29 a share , on $424. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn ' t have any further comment on the merger pact until the meeting of Grolier ' s board today . At that time , Grolier ' s senior management is expected to recommend the acceptance and approval of Hachette ' s new offer , the spokesman added . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Grolier closed at $26. 50 , up 12. 5 cents . Andrew J. Reinhart , Grolier ' s president and chief operating officer , confirmed the agreement .

Last year , Childcraft represented about 10% of Grolier ' s revenue , according to Mr. Reinhart .

In late 1986 , Grolier also bought another toy and game catalog company for $3 million and merged it with Childcraft .

However , its recent efforts to diversify haven ' t always been successful . The 162-year old company was rebuffed last year when it expressed an interest in buying CBS Inc. ' s magazine unit . And in France , a bid for a privatized French television station , TF1 , also failed . It also recently explored and dropped the idea of launching a national daily newspaper in France . The acquisition of Grolier should position Hachette well for the frenzied competition between European publishers for a greater presence in the international market .
