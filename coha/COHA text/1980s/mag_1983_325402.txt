Tennis Star Hu Na gains asylum and strains U.S.-Chinese ties <P> To her supporters the issue was one of political persecution . Reacting to what she viewed as ominous pressure to join the Communist Party , 19-year-old Chinese Tennis Star Hu Na one night last July slipped out of a California hotel during a tennis tour and went into hiding at a friend 's home . But to Peking the issue was a critical test of Chinese-American relations . Worried that Washington might grant Hu Na political asylum , ViceChairman Deng Xiaoping urged the U.S. last August to consider " the greater interests of the relations between the two countries . " <P> For more than eight months , the U.S. agonized over the decision . At the State Department , the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs argued in favor of granting Hu asylum ; its China desk , fearing further deterioration of ties with Peking , disagreed on legal grounds . In the end , the department sent the Immigration and Naturalization Service a weakly worded recommendation in Hu 's favor . INS then stalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure began to build , the Justice Department made the final announcement : Justice prevailed . Hu was granted asylum . <P> The reaction in Peking was fast and furious . In a chilly half-hour meeting , Vice Foreign Minister Han Xu delivered a stiff protest to American Ambassador Arthur Hummel Jr . Social contacts with American diplomats in China were instantly chilled , and cultural and athletic exchange programs were suspended for the rest of the year , the first official downgrading of ties by Peking since diplomatic relations between the two countries were formally restored in January 1979 . At the minimum , the Hu Na incident symbolized the growing tensions between the Reagan Administration and the People 's Republic . " The U.S. Government has kept doing things that infringe on China 's sovereignty , interfere in its internal affairs and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people , " read Peking 's protest . In fact , China had hoped to prevent the Hu Na case from adding to the current strains with the U.S. and had sent signals that it would not strongly object if its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not carry the nettlesome label of political asylum . <P> The net effect of the Hu Na decision was to underscore far deeper strains : <P> &gt; China remains livid over continued American arms sales to the independent regime on Taiwan . The week before last , Peking officials repeatedly urged a visiting delegation of Congressmen , led by House Speaker Tip O'Neill , to downgrade U.S. support of Taiwan . O'Neill 's admission that he was unaware the issue was so sensitive utterly astonished the Chinese-and American diplomats as well . According to Peking , U.S. plans to sell Taiwan $800 million worth of weapons this year ( vs. $600 million in 1982 ) represent a serious violation of an agreement signed last August in which the U.S. pledged to phase out such deals . The Administration argues that the 1983 sales represent a drop , after inflation , from the $600 million of arms sold to Taiwan in 1979 . TIME has learned there are yet more arms sales problems on the horizon : Taiwan is currently pressing the U.S. to approve the sale of modern surface-to-air defensive missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
