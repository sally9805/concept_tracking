In two lights appear two huge blown-up photographs of two famous faces : a sour Queen Victoria , looking at the world with stern disapproval and a grizzled Ulysses S. Grant , staring blandly , chewing on a cigar . Below , a room at Windsor Castle . Victorian sofa and a table holding liquor , cigars . A British band is playing a march outside it . Jesse Grant , nineteen years old , wearing formal evening clothes and red socks , enters and gets matches from the table . He strikes one for his cigar and all the stage is brightly lit . Jesse hops and skips to the music , going to the window to look down at the band . Enter John Cordon , formally dressed . With him is his wife , Edwina Cordon , a dazzling British beauty , in an evening dress with an elegant shawl over her shoulders . EDWINA Good evening , Jesse ! JESSE Oh , yeah . Hi .
