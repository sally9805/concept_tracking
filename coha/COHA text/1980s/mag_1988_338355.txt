For at least some of the thousands of elderly Americans whose life savings are threatened by the astronomical cost of a catastrophic illness , the bill comes just in time . Last week House and Senate conferees approved the Catastrophic Loss Prevention Act , the largest expansion of Medicare since its creation 23 years ago . The new legislation is designed to prevent 31 million elderly and disabled Americans from being wiped out by the crippling cost of hospitalization . Among other things , the bill provides unlimited free hospital care after a $589 deductible is reached , a $1,400 annual limit on doctor 's fees and a portion of outpatient drugs . <P> The expanded coverage is expected to cost $32 billion over the next five years , which will be paid by Medicare premiums of up to $800 . Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen has championed the bill , and the measure is expected to sail through the House and Senate .
