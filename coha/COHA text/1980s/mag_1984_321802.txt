To the Editors : <P> <P> I arrived in this strange land as a student three years ago , and am delighted and bemused to see the two presidential candidates tear each other apart , especially in the debates NATION , Oct. 29 . I do not know which man is better . But I do know I like the U.S. because all this is happening without a single stone being thrown . <P> <P> Jun Sung Lee Hoboken , N.J. <P> <P> The ability to debate is not necessarily the sign of an effective leader . In fact , debates are often won by the candidate most skilled in the quick sidestep and the artful dodge . A leader must take time and have some solitude before engaging his mouth . Robert Brundin Torrance , Calif . <P> <P> If rhetorical agility were important to carrying out the functions of a President , then we might do better to scrounge up future candidates from the ranks of criminal lawyers or radio talk-show hosts . Fortunately , most voters give more weight to other qualities that a president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Robert Bao East Lansing , Mich . <P> <P> What has happened to American politics , that a man like Walter Mondale can question the competency of President Reagan and manipulate the media to the point that Mondale has credibility ? <P> <P> Russ Scearce Seattle <P> During the debates I felt as if I were watching the emperor without his clothes . I saw a President outfitted by imagemakers ; yet the nakedness of his ideas was obvious . His economic and social policies will exploit the powerless , invade the most private aspects of our lives and in the process may bankrupt the country . <P> <P> Anita Krusko Somers , N. Y. <P> <P> Mondale debated well , but one night does not make up for four years of hard work . Under the Reagan Administration the U.S. has lower interest rates , lower unemployment and greater productivity . The President is making America healthy again . <P> <P> Lenore O'Neill Salisbury , Md . <P> <P> In the second debate President Reagan said the alternative to the Philippine regime of Ferdinand Marcos might be Communism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcos ? In that statement , Reagan summed up his simplistic and potentially destructive approach to foreign policy . <P> <P> Kenneth A. Weene Syosset , N. Y. <P> <P> From the debates it would appear that we have two responsible and informed men calling each other irresponsible and uninformed . Whoever is right , we are destined to elect an irresponsible and uninformed President . <P> <P> Jim Mang Buffalo <P> Busted Brothel <P> Your article " Case of the Classy Madam " NATION , Oct. 29 is disturbing . Has the New York City police department nothing better to do than crack down on a prostitution ring ? In France , Sydney Biddie Barrows would have received the grand cross of the Legion of Honor for her services to humanity . <P> <P> Andrew A. Recsei Santa Barbara , Calif . <P> <P> I am sorry Barrows ' bordello was closed . I hope her 3,000 clients will now become proponents of legalized prostitution . With all the social problems we must face , it is hypocritical to focus on this harmless " crime . " <P> <P> Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prey
