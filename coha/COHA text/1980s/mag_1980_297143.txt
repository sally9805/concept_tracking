Congress girds for a new era <P> With adjournment looming , the 96th Congress moved last week to set itself up for the 97th and Ronald Reagan 's White House . Among House Republicans , the preparation took the form of electing Illinois ' Robert Michel as minority leader over Michigan 's Guy Vander Jagt ; obviously , the feeling was that the new President 's legislative program stood a better chance against the Democratic majority under Michel 's brand of amicable persuasion . Republicans also elected New York 's Jack Kemp as chairman of the party 's conference , or caucus , and Mississippi 's Trent Lott as party whip . <P> In selecting their new leadership , House Republicans were trying to downplay their traditional image as the party of reaction and obstruction . Thanking his colleagues for electing him , Michel said : " We 've got to be affirmative , forward looking . The bottom line is enacting the Reagan program . " He warned Democrats against trying to " gut " Reagan 's proposals . If that happens , said he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , confrontation will be kept to a minimum . Stinging in partisan debate on the floor , he is conciliatory in the cloakroom , putting together packages and deals . Michel and Tennessee 's Howard Baker , the new Senate majority leader , will have unaccustomed Republican muscle . In the next Congress , the G.O.P. can claim 192 of the House 's 435 members , as well as 53 of 100 Senators . <P> Meanwhile , House Democrats voted to keep the Rules Committee , which determines access to the floor for almost all legislation , overwhelmingly Democratic . They also nominated Thomas ( Tip ) O'Neill of Massachusetts for re-election as Speaker , as expected . <P> Before ending its session and heading for adjournment , the 96th Congress dealt with a flurry of bills . The legislators dumped an auto safety measure and dropped a fair housing enforcement bill ; they dithered over whether to approve a $10,000-a-year pay raise for themselves ( to $70,000 ) and pay hikes for the top 34,000 employees of the Federal Government . Senate Republicans gave up trying to ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not settled . Said Busing Foe Jesse Helms of North Carolina : " Forty days from now we 'll have a new President . " And a new and markedly different Congress .
