Boston drivers , a notoriously freewheeling breed , find their ultimate frustration on the city 's Central Artery . Twice each weekday , for a total of seven hours , it becomes a virtual parking lot . The highway , a six-lane stretch of Interstate 93 that snakes through Boston 's downtown section from the Massachusetts Turnpike to the Charles River , handles 180,000 automobiles a day  --  nearly 2 1/2 times its stated capacity . The two-mile elevated section , built without any shoulders or slowdown and speedup lanes for exits and entrances , has an accident rate that is twice the average for urban highways in the U.S. Next year Massachusetts will begin a ten-year , $4.3 billion project to rebuild and reroute some seven miles of highway , including Central Artery . Construction will add four traffic lanes , enough to accommodate an anticipated 210,000 vehicles a day , and will replace the elevated roadway with a tunnel . But Transportation Secretary James Burnley sternly criticizes the underground portion of the project for not adding enough capacity .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
