For some , such as Josef Albers , whose photographs from the Bauhaus years are now on view at the Museum of Modern Art , photography was a momentary , if fascinating , diversion . For others , such as Charles Sheeler , whose retrospective exhibition is now at the Whitney Museum of American Art , it played a more central role. // Albers ( 1888-1976 ) , an early student at the avant-garde Weimar design school , and a member of its faculty from 1923 to 1933 , shared in the experimental spirit of its time . He eagerly explored areas not traditionally associated with high culture , including stained-glass windows and furniture , trying to bring art closer to life . Not surprisingly , he also became interested in photography , which he pursued in earnest from 1928 to 1932. // Today , of course , Albers is best known for his series of postwar paintings titled " Homage to the Square . " These abstract , refined , proto-Minimalist color studies seem far removed from the ebullient , sometimes giddy quality of his photographs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from portraits of Bauhaus colleagues and images of laundry drying on a line to collages consisting of up to a dozen individual images arranged and mounted on board . Although a few provide evidence of Albers ' s interest in geometric form , most seem more intent on describing a world of animation and unexpected coincidences. // One could make the case that Albers was interested in finding new ways of using the camera to make art , investigating its unique qualities , just as later he assayed the qualities of color and tonality in the " Square " paintings . Certainly , the variety of approaches evident even in this small selection of images lends credence to this assumption . But it would be a mistake to think that his methods were entirely original . As John Szarkowski , the show ' s curator and director of the museum ' s photography department , points out in his catalogue essay , Albers took up photography just after Laszlo Moholy-Nagy left the Bauhaus . Moholy-Nagy had introduced many avant-garde approaches to photography into Bauhaus circles , including photo-collage , bird ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albers was not shy about using. // In addition , one can feel in Albers ' s images influences as diverse as Parisian Surrealism and Russian Constructivism . Only the multiple-print collages seem the artist ' s own . In the best of these - " Bullfight , " circa 1930 , for example - a geometric structure abets the camera ' s penchant for building narrative drama from a myriad of details . The often tattered and stained collages are unprepossessing as visual objects , but they can be admired for their playful , inquisitive spirit. // " The Photographs of Josef Albers , " selected from the archive of the Albers Foundation and organized by the American Federation of the Arts , continues at the Museum of Modern Art through April 19 , after which it will travel to Denver and Montreal. // Photography was but a brief episode in Albers ' s career , and from the evidence of his later work ( none of it to be found in the show ) it was not a pivotal one . For Charles Sheeler , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his esthetic . In the retrospective exhibition of Sheeler ' s paintings , drawings and photographs , organized by the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston , and now at the Whitney through April 17 , the influence of photography is unmistakable and crucial . Many of the works in oil or conte crayon are virtually exact duplicates of photographs Sheeler had taken earlier . With other paintings and drawings in the show , there is no corresponding photographic image in existence , but the perspective , tonality and attention to detail all speak of photographic precedent. // At the start of his career in the early 1900 ' s Sheeler painted in a manner loosely derived from Cezanne . But a few years after 1912 , when he took up photography as a way to earn his keep , his style became more representational and photographic . The 1913 Armory Show may also have influenced his move toward structural form , but it was his photography that supplied the means for translating the physical world into its simplified equivalent - the part-Realist , Cubist-indebted style that we know as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of paintings and drawings , the exhibition supplies abundant evidence of Sheeler ' s reliance on the camera . It includes , for example , both his well-known painting of a locomotive ' s drive wheels , " Rolling Power " of 1939 , and the photograph , " Wheels , " on which it is based . Unfortunately , however , the show is organized by medium rather than date , so comparing the photographs to their corresponding drawings and paintings is a task that involves shuttling from gallery to gallery. // What is worse , however , is that the show is hung backwards . Instead of seeing the photographs , then the drawings and finally the paintings , which is the order in which Sheeler generally worked , we are first confronted by the paintings . The photographs are confined to the galleries farthest from the entrance . While this arrangement serves to validate the art marketplace ' s established pecking order , it does violence to any understanding of Sheeler ' s methods . More than that , it makes him look like a mediocre artist. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures are photographs , and for a time his renown as a photographer exceeded his reputation as a painter . Only the art world ' s inability to accept the notion that photographs could be as important as paintings led him to de-emphasize his independent work with the camera . But even after his dealer advised him , in 1931 , to quit photography for painting , Sheeler continued to take photographs as source material for his works on canvas . Indeed , the show ' s most intriguing paintings are from the late 40 ' s and early 50 ' s , when the artist began to paint from photographs printed from two or more negatives . One lesson of the show is that our tendency to consider artists ' photographs as subordinate to their paintings sometimes fails to do justice to their careers . Canvas is not always the ultimate repository of whatever lessons artists learn in their encounters with the lens. // In our own time , the artist most like Sheeler in terms of making photography an essential part of his art may well be Lucas Samaras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s , he has continued to find ways to use photographic images to fuel his concerns with identity , ego , family history and artistic performance . All this is writ large in an excellent new book , " Samaras : The Photographs of Lucas Samaras , " by Ben Lifson ( Aperture , $50 ) . Mr. Lifson , a photography critic , argues persuasively that in the last 15 years photography has shifted from being " a subsidiary element " in Samaras ' s oeuvre to assume a position at its core. //
