Through that and other windows we see trees in full bloom and hear party noises . The kitchen table and counter is laden with platters of food : chicken salad , potato salad , chopped liver , etc . JACK and HELEN , both in their 60 's , stand at the garden door , looking out . HELEN AND JACK ( With MARILYN offstage and OTHER OFFSTAGE VOICES .

MARILYN Plenty ! JACK Ask a foolish question ! HELEN I do n't like it  --  a baby that age being sick so often . MARILYN Do n't worry , it 's limited to birthdays and get-togethers . JACK She has a point . HELEN Jake 's all right ? MARILYN He 's outside . JACK So where is he ? MARILYN Talking to Rudy . If you feel better , come out . JACK Fashionably late . The big shot !

I went shopping and overdid it . I took it easy but still I got all tuckered out . So I stopped for a chocolate milkshake in Woolworth 's . A young woman was sitting on the stool next door to me . So proud , she musta thunk she was in Longchamps . You should have seen her put away a hot dog and roll . As if it were caviar . Well , my deah ! I had to hold back the tears of laughter . She took out a silver-plated cigarette case that must have cost her boyfriend an arm and a leg . Then she turned to me and asked for a match . Me , she 's asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then another customer who asked another customer who asked another . I was in convulsions ! Not a single match in all of Woolworth 's ! She looked like she was about to have apoplexy . MARILYN ( Laughing . ) Mama , how do you find them ? ( Exits with trays of food . ) JACK ( To MARILYN . ) Tell him the liquor 's in here ! That 'll bring him fast enough ! HELEN ( To MARILYN . ) Me , I 'm an innocent . They find me ! ( To JACK . ) I wish you would n't talk like that . p. 12 JACK Marilyn ? She 's a good sport . HELEN You know what I mean . JACK What ? I 'll offend your son , the teetotaler ? HELEN Who sets the example ? JACK That 's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard .

HELEN returns the embrace warmly , clutching him for a long time , till JAKE must detach himself gently . JACK starts to respond casually but , overcome with sudden emotion , grabs him and kisses him on both cheeks . ) Come on ! The party 's outside ! HELEN Not us , kid ! JACK We 're the party ! You son of a gun ! I 'm mad as hell at you ! Where 's my granddaughter ? HELEN Look at him , you look skinny . p. 13 JAKE Louise caught cold , now Edie 's got it .

I took you home in the subway , I felt every eye was on me , accusing fingers  --  ( Points. ) child murderer ! I got you home , sat you down and stuffed food down your throat . You spit it up and I stuffed it down again . What did I know ? I was terrified ! JAKE You were terrified ? HELEN Such a dope , your mother . To this day I wonder if that 's what made you a picky eater . I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night worrying about it . Heart palpitations . I 'm getting over-excited now just talking about it . JAKE Do n't worry , Mama , I lived . HELEN What did I know ? The mistakes I made with you ! Jake , you shoulda picked yourself another Ma .

" p. 16 JACK More ! More ! ( HELEN does a little dance , a kick , wiggles her ass . JACK laps it up , applauds , cries " Bravo !

JAKE The one thing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HELEN Not for me , darling boy , for you . JAKE I 'll pour it back in the bottle . HELEN So someone else can drink the poison . Do n't do me any favors . ( JAKE pours drink into bottle , spilling some on the table . HELEN wipes it up with the flat of her hand . ) JACK So what 's the good word , young-fellow-melad ? When are they going to make you editor of the Times ? JAKE Oh , I did n't tell you ? They fired me . JACK My son , the comedian . Anything new to report ? JAKE You see my story yesterday on the dangerous drugs U.S. corporations are selling in the Third World ? JACK Did I see it ? I cut it out and Scotch taped it to the cash register . Any customer who came into the store , I would n't sell him a shirt until he read your report . Lucky for me it was a short article or I 'd be out good money . JAKE Well , they hacked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article ? p. 18 JAKE I turned in 25 hundred words , and short at that for all the information I had to stuff in . They butchered it . They simply butchered it . JACK They have to make room for someone else in the paper besides you , Jake . HELEN They have their own fish to fry ; I 'm sure they know what they 're doing . JACK What else is new ? You working on anything special ? JAKE I 'm doing an article for Esquire on Henry Kissinger . JACK How do you like that ! Are you going to get to meet him ? JAKE I interviewed him yesterday . JACK As I live and breathe ! Ma , did you hear that ? HELEN Why not ? Someday Henry Kissinger will interview Jake . JACK What else in new .

JAKE It 's a study , a social study , an analysis , O.K. ? Of the aberrant effects of cold war politics on the state of our domestic lives . p. 19 HELEN My son , Walter Lippmann ! JAKE We 're living in an age of institutionalized paranoia today  --  O.K. ?  --  an extraordinary sense of powerlessness from the guy on the assembly line in Detroit to those clowns in the White House . Do n't get nervous , Ma , listen . So I think I can trace the roots of this back to the cold war  --  not in terms of foreign policy  --  but how it 's corrupted our national spirit . O.K. ? , what I 'm writing about  --  it 's a wonderful story  --  the moral and ethical disintegration of the American Dream , basically . HELEN You do n't want to get into trouble , Jake . JACK Do n't be silly . It 's a damned clever idea . Where did you get it from ? Kissinger ? HELEN They 're very powerful men . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HELEN You 've got responsibilities . You 're not footloose , you know . JACK You have a publisher ? JAKE I want to get into it before I start looking . HELEN You should n't do something for nothing . JAKE Well , I ca n't very well sell a book that does n't have a line written , Ma. p. 20 HELEN You do n't have to use that tone of voice ; I know a thing or two . Authors get advances all the time . You have a considerable reputation . Any publisher should be dying to get his hands on you . JACK What else ? HELEN Have n't we heard enough ? He 's a dynamo , my son . The day you got the job the excitement in your voice when you told us over the telephone . Dad and I sat up half the night in the kitchen toasting your success with glasses of milk . We were big shots ! Our son on the New York Times ! JACK When are we going to see you ? JAKE You 're seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy . When are you coming to visit ? I have hopes of seeing my granddaughter before I die . JAKE Dad , whenever I see you , you ask when am I going to see you ? I really do n't know what you want . You want me to move back in ? ( Pause . ) You know how often most other sons visit their parents ? JACK I did n't know there was a standard . JAKE Look , I 'm here . We 're together . Let 's try to enjoy it . JACK I 'd enjoy it if I could for once see my granddaughter. p. 21 JAKE Anytime ! You come over anytime you want . How many times do I have to tell you that ? JACK That 's not an invitation . JAKE It is an invitation . JACK An invitation is next Tuesday , next Wednesday , next Sunday . That 's an invitation . JAKE That 's your house . In my house we do n't believe in formalities like that . JACK In his house ! Your friends all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday dates , Saturday dates ? They just call and say " We 're coming over " ? JAKE That 's right . JACK You 're full of hot air ! JAKE It 's true . JACK I 'll tell you what 's true . When you give us a date to come over we 'll come over . JAKE What do you want ? A formal invitation ? HELEN It 's been heard of . JACK You could also come see us . JAKE I do . JACK With the family . JAKE Louise had a very difficult miscarriage . JACK Three years ago and she 's still having her miscarriage. p. 22 HELEN Seriously , Jake , are you not telling us something ? JAKE She 's all right . She just ca n't travel much . HELEN You 're not protecting us from bad news ? Do n't ever protect us . JAKE She 's fine . Just not very strong . JACK Now tell us you did n't take her to Europe . JAKE That was on assignment . JACK Pretend for once that we 're your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby with strangers . JAKE She did n't leave the baby  --  we left the baby . I 'm the father , remember ? We left the baby with Annie . HELEN I do n't mean to question Louise 's judgment . JAKE Mama , it was both our judgment . Annie has been with us since Edie was born . She has two kids of her own and she 's very responsible . Maybe next time we 'll leave her with you . JACK Maybe . Maybe means there wo n't be a next time . HELEN What is it , Jake ? Is there anything about your marriage I should know about you 're not telling me ? JAKE Absolutely not ! p. 23 HELEN You 're getting along ? JAKE Perfectly ! HELEN Whatever other trouble there is in the family I 'd rather have you happy . That comes first . JAKE I am happy . HELEN Good . JACK Fine . Everybody 's happy . When do I see my granddaughter ? JAKE Look , Louise has had very bad experiences of her own with families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . JAKE It 's not your fault . She just does n't go in for family gatherings . It has nothing to do with you . HELEN She 's a little cold , your wife . I 'm more sorry than I can tell you to say it . JAKE She is not cold , Mama . I wo n't have you talk about my wife behind her back . HELEN When else do I get the chance ? JACK Show us her front and we 'll talk about her . We 'd be more than happy , I promise you ! HELEN All we ask is a chance to know her better and love her . She 'll find out : all you have is your family . Just wait when there 's an emergency . Friends go this way , that way . All you have is your family . p. 24 JAKE I 've had lots of emergencies with Louise . She has always stood behind me . You do n't know her . She has literally saved my life . More than once . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's the best thing that ever happened to me ! ( A long , uncomfortable pause . ) HELEN Your welfare has always been uppermost in our minds . JAKE I have n't had a chance to talk to Rudy . HELEN Far be it from me  --  JAKE It is his birthday . JACK Marilyn said you already talked to him . JAKE I said hello to him . JACK Say goodby to him . Who 's stopping you ? JAKE I wo n't be long . JACK Do n't do us any favors . ( JAKE exits . ) HELEN I made some terrible mistakes with him . Marilyn turned out like a dream , but Jake  --  Can you believe it ? JACK He 's full of hot air . HELEN ( Simultaneously . ) I 'm not going to let him make me sick . MARILYN ( Enters . ) You want anything ? p. 25 HELEN Peace of mind . MARILYN That I ca n't give you . How about some nice fish ? HELEN You 're too good . ( To JACK . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside now , Mama ? HELEN I 'm not up to it . JACK She 's not up to it . MARILYN It 's beautiful outside . You 'll like it once you 're out there . If you do n't you can always come right back in . HELEN I do n't have the strength . All this emotion ! I think I overdid it with the cleaning yesterday . JACK She 'll never learn . HELEN It had to be done . JACK I told you I would 've done it . HELEN Later . Always later . JACK What 's the big hurry ? HELEN The big hurry is you do things in their proper place and then you 're finished . JACK I would have done it . HELEN I did n't have the strength to keep after you . ( To MARILYN . ) He means well but you have to keep after him . ( Takes MARILYN 'S hand . ) Jake should have found someone like you , Marilyn . She would have put him on the right track . You made such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know how lucky he is. p. 26 MARILYN I 'm lucky he puts up with me . JACK He 's the lucky one . What are you talking about ? HELEN The mistake is to let them get away with too much . They get to take too much for granted . MARILYN Ma , I 'm not that easy to live with , believe me . JACK She does n't know what she 's talking about . HELEN You 're a saint . MARILYN Please do n't do that . HELEN What did I do now ? MARILYN You do n't call me a saint and I wo n't call you a virgin . HELEN Your mouth too ? What did I do to deserve two such mouths ? MARILYN Mama . HELEN I 'm decent . My mother taught me to be decent . Dad , it 's stuffy , please open a window . MARILYN Why do n't you go outside ? HELEN Do what I ask . I 'm getting a flush . MARILYN I 'll do it . ( Opens window . ) Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mama ? ( HELEN signals with a wave of her hand that SHE ca n't talk . ) Are you gon na be all right ? Do you want anything ? ( HELEN , with another wave of her hand , signals her away from the window , points to the chair SHE wants MARILYN to sit down in . MARILYN sits . HELEN waves her in closer . MARILYN moves close in on her. ) p. 27 HELEN ( Whispers . ) I 'll be all right in a second . ( JACK appears increasingly nervous , scratches the top of his hands . ) Tell your father not to pick . MARILYN Do n't pick . JACK I 'm scratching . ( HELEN starts to whisper , ca n't , shakes her head at MARILYN and then points to JACK . ) MARILYN She wants you to stop scratching . ( HELEN waves MARILYN in closer , whispers in her ear . ) She says you have a skin rash . JACK It 's acting up . MARILYN Leave it alone . What are you doing for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me see . ( HELEN points for her to look . MARILYN looks . ) Daddy , they look awful ! JACK ( Almost proud . ) They hurt like hell . HELEN I 'm a little better . MARILYN Are you O.K. , Mama ? Can I get you something ? HELEN It was one of my flushes . They put me out of commission for a while . I 'm all right . A little overheated . p. 28 MARILYN You better relax . Take it easy . HELEN I could use a little air . MARILYN Why do n't you cool off first ? HELEN I 'll cool off outside . I ca n't breathe in this stuffy kitchen . How do you put up with it ? MARILYN I do n't know if you should go out so soon . HELEN ( To JACK . ) Is n't she an angel ? If it were n't for you I do n't know what . MARILYN You need help ? HELEN That 'll be the day ! ( Starts off . JACK falls in behind her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pours herself a drink . Sips it and lets go of a sigh . JAKE enters . ) JAKE Drinking , Marilyn ? ( Puts his hand to his heart . ) It hurts me right here . MARILYN ( Turns to see him . ) I was scared they came back to finish me off ! ( Laughs . ) You at least drink in front of her ; I still do n't have the nerve . It makes me furious with myself . JAKE The only way to win with them is to leave town . p. 29 MARILYN You think so ? Try Philadelphia . We could always kill them , I suppose . JAKE Short-range solutions . MARILYN You at least , they know you 're alive ! ! No matter what I do you know how it feels ? I 'll put it this way : If you take them some place in your car , you 're this wonderful success who can afford his own car ; if I take them some place in my car , I 'm the chauffeur . More than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved most was you and Mama in the kitchen with your stories . She 'd tell one , you 'd tell one , she 'd tell one , you 'd tell one . I thought someday I 'll be old enough to have my own real experiences and then I 'll have stories ! To this day they will now allow me to tell a story . Is n't it crazy that I should still be bothered by that ? JAKE I told my stories to get away from her stories . MARILYN Who gets away ? How did we ever make it out of Queens in one piece ? JAKE I got drafted out . MARILYN But how did I get out ? JAKE What makes you think you 're out ? MARILYN You do n't think so , huh ? Maybe you 're right . You think I 'm that bad ? I suppose I am. p. 30 JAKE How often do you call them on the phone ? MARILYN Who counts ? JAKE Once a day ? MARILYN At least . JAKE I do n't speak to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message that they called I let a couple of days go by before I call back . How often do you have them over ? MARILYN Half the time they invite themselves . JAKE With me they know better . MARILYN So do I. JAKE How often do you run down to Riverdale to do their shopping for them ? MARILYN Cut it out , you 're depressing me . JAKE Why ca n't they order by phone ? MARILYN Mama says they hold you up if you order by phone . Who knows ? JAKE Next time , simply refuse to go . MARILYN You are giving me a heart attack ! JAKE You are a married woman with two kids and a well-paying job  --  MARILYN Not so well-paying . JAKE And you 're too busy to run errands for them . Now tell them . You can tell them . Tell them . p. 31 MARILYN ( Shudders . ) You give me the creeps when you talk like that . You sound like you hate them . ( Pause . JAKE avoids a response . ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break off entirely ? JAKE Look , they are hardly the most important thing going on in my life . Why overreact ? They 're old ; a couple of phone calls keep them happy . MARILYN We used to be so close and now we see things so differently . You were the one person in the family I could go to for help . JAKE Who could I go to ? MARILYN Me . ( JAKE turns away , no response . MARILYN is hurt . HE pours drink . ) Boy ! ( JAKE , noticing effect on her , begins devouring tray of hors d'oeuvres . ) JAKE Christ , these are good . I do n't know , Marilyn . Louise ! Jeez . Louise is so insanely loyal . This is a wonderful story . I invited some Times colleagues over for dinner . Not such a big deal , except that Louise hates The New York Times ( as much as they think it comes down from Mount Sinai ) . O.K. ? Because I report all my fights , all this inter-office crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are  --  office politics , O.K. ? But Louise worked in an office for 15 minutes once when she was on vacation from Mount Holyoke , so she does n't understand ; she takes it personally . So I come home , bitch , bitch , bitch , bitch , bitch , that 's it , it 's over , I go to work happy the next morning . While Louise hates . How can they do this to her Jake ? Off with their heads ! O.K. ? So when I invite my oppressors home to dinner , she goes bananas . " How can you sit down at the same table with these pigs ? How can you eat with them ? ! " Right ? But finally she agrees . Grudgingly . You want to know how grudgingly ? This is a week ago Tuesday . I come home ; she 's got a roast chicken in the oven , it smells marvelous . The apartment looks beautiful . I check out the dining room . There are only four chairs . We 're having eight to dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairs ? " " They are being repaired , " she says . " They broke this morning and I sent them out to be repaired . " Possibly a little hostile . O.K. ? We call her brother , Mickey . Mickey 's her Mr. Fix-it . Lives three blocks away . Comes running over with four chairs . Fine . We get through the dinner . Louise wo n't talk to anybody , but no problem : My colleagues talk to much to notice wives not talking . Bruce Forrester is charming , Glen Applebaum is charming , The New York Times voltage meter on charm , way up there . Louise hates them all . " Establishment assholes , " she calls them . A ten-minute shit-fit after they leave . I 'm a sell-out , a hypocrite , she ca n't talk to me any more . She calls her brother , Mickey ; she wants to go over . Mickey says , " It 's midnight . " " It 's irrelevant , " says Louise , " I 'm coming over . " Mickey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , at 12:30 , Louise and I are struggling up West End Avenue with four chairs . Louise is wheezing ! I 'm so pissed , I ca n't see straight . We get up to Broadway . She goes on strike . She sits down on a chair  --  ( JACK enters from garden , stands by door and listens . JAKE includes him in his audience . ) What am I supposed to do ? I sit down on a chair . People start coming out of the subway ; they see us , they make cracks . It 's very strange to see two grown people sitting on chairs outside the subway on Broadway at 12:30 in the morning . I feel like a total ass , but Louise loves it . She cracks back at the people coming out the the subway , and soon there 's a small crowd gathered around us . My wife is a hell of a better hostess on the street than at her own dinner party . Three street musicians show up  --  they play . Why not ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Louise ! In the end , Louise talks four guys in the crowd to carry the chairs over to Mickey 's for us. p. 32 MARILYN God , that Louise is a scream , Jake . You know that ? JACK I missed it . Jake ? JAKE You heard it . JACK I came in late . JAKE You heard most of it , Dad . JACK Most of it leaves some out . Who knows what I heard ? JAKE Well , I ca n't tell it again . MARILYN Daddy , it 's a wonderful story . JAKE I 'm exhausted . MARILYN O.K. , I 'll tell it . Listen to this . Last week Jake and Louise had a dinner party last week for some people on the Times  --  JACK Big shots . He invites the big shots . JAKE No big shots . JACK Do n't tell me . MARILYN Well , Louise has a thing against the Times  --  JACK No , she does n't . MARILYN Yeah , you see ? Whenever Jake comes home with , you know a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only does she get mad , she stays mad . But Jake 's not mad  --  p. 33 JAKE No , I 'm not mad . ( JAKE grins , continues to grin as HE listens to story . ) MARILYN But Louise has conniption fits . So by this time Jake is long over being mad . Jake invites these colleagues of his home for dinner , and Louise  --  she ca n't stand to have them in her house . You understand ? JACK That 's awful . That 's terrible . Go on . Go on . MARILYN So here 's Jake , he 's hosting this big dinner party , and he comes home and Louise is cooking away in the kitchen . Cooking , cooking , cooking . Everything is peachy-keen , except when he goes in the dining room , you know , something is very , very wrong . JACK What ? MARILYN There are eight people for dinner  --  right ? And there are only four chairs . Four chairs ! Can you believe it ? ! ( HELEN enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Can you believe that gang ? Eat you out of house and home . MARILYN That day Louise sent them out to be repaired ! Look who 's here . ( JACK begins scratching his hand . JAKE pours drink . ) Where was I ? Yeah . So what are they going to do about these chairs ? Because Louise sent them out that day , you know , to be repaired , and they did n't  --  I guess they did n't come back in time  --  they were  --  Were they supposed to come back that day and they did n't Jake , or what ? p. 34 JAKE It 's not important . MARILYN What ? This is unconscious or conscious on her part ? What motivates her behavior ? JAKE Maybe I 'd better tell this . MARILYN Hold your horses ! So anyway , they go out  --  No , they do n't . Yes , they do . Jake and Louise , to get some chairs . What  --  you left Edie alone ? JAKE She was asleep . MARILYN So early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . MARILYN O.K. , so I 'm a little mixed up . What 's the difference ? It 's no big deal , it 's a lousy story . Mama , they get the chairs and they have the dinner and everybody has a terrible time  --  JAKE No . MARILYN Everybody has a good time , and they go home , and Jake and Louise wait till Edie 's asleep and then they take back the chairs . Did I get it right that time ? ( JAKE nods . ) And they 're on the street , you know , with these stupid chairs , and it 's like two in the morning , um , and what happens is very funny and I do n't remember what it is , and anyway I 'd screw it up . JACK Marilyn Marilyn Where were they going with the chairs ? p. 35 MARILYN Back to Mickey 's . You know ! HELEN Her brother ? JAKE Right . Yeah , right . MARILYN I left that out ? JACK Mickey was there for dinner ? MARILYN ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickey was not there for dinner . MARILYN You do n't have to snap at me . JAKE I did n't snap . HELEN So all these famous people were at your house , Jake ? JAKE No , Ma , just friends . HELEN Some friends from work ? JAKE That 's right . HELEN From The New York Times ? JAKE That 's right . HELEN It must have been a very scintillating evening . JAKE Not during dinner . HELEN After dinner ? JAKE After the guests left . HELEN You 're pulling your Ma 's leg , Jakey-boy ? p. 36 JAKE Look , I 'll put it this way : Louise hates the Times , she hates everything about the Times , she would love me to work on the Washington Post . JACK Sure . Out of town . JAKE But when I ask my colleagues to dinner , well , she 's really a loyal girl  --  O.K. ? She grits her teeth and prepares this fabulous menu . HELEN You 're going too fast for me , Jake . What did you serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JAKE Corn on the cob and brussel sprouts . HELEN My mouth is watering . JAKE And the apartment  --  O.K. ?  --  it 's  --  well , Ma , even you would think she did a good job . How can I describe it ? A show place , Ma . HELEN Radio City ? JAKE Better , Ma . The Taj Mahal . But , Ma , I go into the dining room  --  are you listening ?  --  and the dining room table is set for a banquet , a royal banquet . Our best sterling silver , tall elegant glasses  --  they sparkle , our best china , Ma , the plates shine ! But there 's one problem  --  p. 37 HELEN Did n't I know it . JAKE We are eight for dinner . Eight  --  O.K. ? But there are four chairs at the table . HELEN Ah-ha ! A riddle ! Your Ma loves riddles . What happened to the other four chairs ? JACK Yeah , Jake , yeah ! ( ALL look at JAKE in wonder . ) MARILYN This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue story. ) @x TIME : One year later . JAKE and LOUISE 'S apartment on West End Avenue , the living room . Not unattractive , but absent-mindedly furnished ; nothing quite works together . An archway leads to the hall , EDIE 'S bedroom , door closed and the front door . JAKE 'S desk is hemmed into a corner , out of place , littered with page proofs . At rise , JAKE is seated , turned away from the desk , anxiously facing LOUISE , who is on the telephone . LOUISE is in her 30 's , extremely attractive . LOUISE It 's nice to hear your voice , too , Jack You sound so much stronger Well , you gave us a worry No , nothing especially You know , her usual adorable self Well , she misses you too Well , we 'll make up for it on Sunday Of course , it 's still on Now , Jack now , no one thinks that well , if Jake has n't called you back I do n't know , he must be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for why HE has n't called his FATHER back . ) Oh , I do know , I forgot to tell him you called . I apologize , Jack . So , you see it 's my fault . I usually have a memo pad right here by the phone so I can take messages , but I do n't know what 's become of it Well , if you bought me a new one I 'd love it because it 's a present from you ( Flails at JAKE as if to ask " How do I get off ? " ) Well , I 'm sure he 's all right , Jack . It is n't all hours of the night , now do n't exaggerate , it 's only 8:30 now Not exactly . First he was going to Random House to pick up some galleys on his book and then he had a story or something to cover for the Times Jack , do n't even think that . He has n't changed . You do n't realize how busy he is . He 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAKE mimes his head exploding . ) Well , I 'll let Jake save that for you for Sunday Oh , a whole lot , Jack . Yes , a whole lot is new , but Jake hates it when I tell you . ( JAKE mimes a groan and a collapse . ) She 's inside doing her homework Of course she 's not too busy to say hello . ( Shouts . ) Edie ! ( Pause . ) Edie ! Pick up the phone is our room ! Grandpa wants to say hello ! p. 39 EDIE ( Enters from bedroom . SHE is nine . ) Grandpa Jack or Grandpa Sam ? LOUISE Grandpa Jack ! Pick up the phone , Edie . ( To JACK . ) She 's picking up Jack . One minute . ( Pause . ) So then , we 'll see you on Sunday I 'm really looking forward to it . ( Covers phone with hand . Shouts . ) Edie ! Pick up ! ( To JACK . ) She was in the bathroom , Jack . ( Covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's keeping that child ? ( Into phone . ) I 'm sorry Helen is n't feeling well . Are you sure she 'll be all right for Sunday ? Because we can always  --  Well , tell her I said to take is easy . But the most important thing is her health . And your health . ( To JAKE . ) Jake ! Do something , goddammit , or I 'll tell him you 're here ! ( JAKE leaves room . ) She 'll be there in a second , Jack . Any second . EDIE ( Offstage . ) ( To JAKE . ) I 'm picking up . LOUISE See ? ( JAKE returns , nodding his head . LOUISE covers phone . To JAKE . ) She 's picked up . JAKE I know . ( He sits at his desk , staring at LOUISE on telephone . LOUISE listens , then nods to JAKE that everything is fine . Another long moment passes as JAKE fidgets at his desk and LOUISE fidgets on the phone. ) p. 40 LOUISE She really has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edie . Fine , Jack . Me too . Me too Hang up now , Edie I know it she is , is n't she ? Yes , she really is . Yes , she is . I do n't know where she gets it That 's true She is You could n't be more right about it . She is If he does n't get in too late . And this time I promise I wo n't forget to tell him . You have my word . ( Laughs . ) Now , Jack , is that nice ? I thought you were my friend . ( Laughs . ) So do I. ( Laughs . ) So do I. ( Laughs . ) Absolutely . ( Laughs . ) I ca n't wait . My love to Helen . ( Hangs up . To JAKE . ) They 're coming . The parents are coming ! ( Runs about . ) The parents are coming ! The parents are coming ! To arms ! To arms ! ( JAKE laughs , rises , embraces her . ) They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make you take calls from my mother , do I ? Do I ? Shh . I 'm joking . Shall we hide ? Shall we leave town ? JAKE They 're really coming Sunday . Shit . ( Parts from embrace . ) LOUISE All we talked about in the hospital was his granddaughter , poor man . p. 41 JAKE His granddaughter and his son , the journalist . Thank God I work at the Times or he 'd have trouble remembering my name . LOUISE My mother calls me Mickey three-fifths of the time . Jack is dear , but if Helen criticized my house again  --  she hates my taste  --  I 'll poison her . JAKE My mother ? You think she 'll notice ? The worst cook in the world . LOUISE Next to me . JAKE Close . I know what you can do . She mostly notices furniture . Get rid of the chairs again . LOUISE I should . Would n't it be wonderful , Jake , if I got rid of all the furniture ? They arrive here on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does  --  as if she buys the place  --  and there 's not a stitch here . No furniture . No rugs . No pictures . " Oh Louise , what a veritable place ! I ca n't believe what you 've done to this place . " JAKE ( Laughs . ) That 's right . That 's right . LOUISE ( Crosses to wall , gestures . ) " Oh Louise , I just love this part of the wall . ( Crosses c. , points to floor . ) And the floor . What have you done to the floor ? " p. 42 JAKE " My ! My ! Is that a floor or is that a floor ? " LOUISE " It is such a tidy floor . ( Looks to ceiling . In wonder : ) And the ceiling ! Jack , have you ever seen such a ceiling ? " JAKE ( As JACK . ) " What 's new , son ? Where 's my granddaughter ? ( Squawks like a parrot . ) What 's new ? Where 's my granddaughter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new ? What 's new ? What 's new ? ( Sobering . ) Nu ? Nu ? Nu ? Nu ? Nu ? Nu ? " ( Works his way back to desk , sits , shuffles proofs . ) LOUISE " Louise , what a perfectly perfect crack in the wall , what a gorgeous piece of dust in the corner . Will you look , Jack ? See all the dust Louise is collecting ? Why , Louise , you must let me take this dust home and knit you a sweater . " JAKE Baby , I better get down to work or else LOUISE She lies like a glove , your mother . JAKE Take it easy , will you ? She has n't had such an easy life . And the phrase is rug . Not glove . She lies like a rug . LOUISE Yes . She lies like a rug . ( Crosses to his chair , stands there . Pause . ) Oh , it 'll be fine , Jake . p. 43 JAKE ( Studying proof . ) Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continues to stare down at him . ) JAKE ( After a pause . ) What ? LOUISE I 'm sorry . ( Retreats to her chair , picks up paperback , reads as JAKE works . ) I know who did it . JAKE No you do n't . LOUISE It 's the vicar , is n't it ? ( No response . ) Jake , is n't it the vicar ? ( No response . ) I have to know ! ( No response . ) I 'm going to look . JAKE ( Turns to her . ) You are not . LOUISE I have to know . JAKE You will know when you finish the book . LOUISE What do you care if I look ? JAKE Then why bother ? Why read it in the first place ? If you do n't intend to do it right , why do it at all ? Go ahead , look . I do n't give a damn . You never intended to read it anyway . LOUISE It 's only a murder mystery , for Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . ) I wo n't look . ( Stares at JAKE working . ) Jake , I wo n't look ! ( Pause . ) What a thing to get mad about . I said I would n't look . ( Waits for a response . There is none . ) You stink ! ( Goes back to her reading. ) p. 44 EDIE ( Offstage . ) Mommy ! ( LOUISE does n't answer , continues reading . ) Mommy ! ( JAKE looks up from his proofs and over at LOUISE , waiting for her to answer her CHILD 'S call . ) Mommy ! I need you ! ( LOUISE continues to read . JAKE continues to stare at LOUISE , then goes back to his work . ) LOUISE Shit , it 's not the vicar . ( Turns page . Long silence as LOUSIE reads , JAKE works . ) EDIE ( Offstage . ) Daddy ! JAKE ( Very quickly . ) What is it , angel ? EDIE ( Offstage . ) Can you come here , please ? JAKE I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? EDIE I need you ! ( JAKE puts down his work , glares at LOUISE , who does not look up , and enters EDIE 'S bedroom . ) JAKE I 'm working , honey . EDIE I 'm sorry . p. 45 JAKE What is it ? EDIE What 's the capital of Rumania ? JAKE Edie , I think that 's something you should look up for yourself . EDIE I ca n't . JAKE Yes , you can . EDIE I do n't have time . JAKE In the time we 're talking about it you could have looked it up . EDIE In the time we 're talking about it you could have told me . JAKE You should learn to learn things on your own . EDIE Daddy , I promise . Only tell me this time . JAKE Bucharest . EDIE Spell it . JAKE B-U-C-H-A-R-E-S-T . That 's the last time I do that for you . EDIE Thank you , Daddy . JAKE Anything else ? ( No answer . ) Do you have a lot more homework ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you do n't know ? EDIE I do n't know how much it is until I do it . p. 46 JAKE I 'm going back to work now . EDIE Thanks , Dad . ( JAKE exits bedroom , takes his seat at desk , goes back to work . Stops , turns to LOUISE . ) JAKE I think we should talk about something . LOUISE ( Reading . ) Must we ? JAKE We must . LOUISE Can it wait ? JAKE Baby , please put down that book . LOUISE ( Goes on reading for a few seconds then , with effort , drags her eyes off the page and up to JAKE . ) I 'm in the middle of this . JAKE I want to bring to your attention something you do that bears discussion . Then you can go back to your book . LOUISE Can it wait five minutes , then I 'll be through with this chapter . JAKE ( After a pause . ) O.K. ( She goes to her book , HE to his work . But HE ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns , stares at her as SHE reads . LOUISE eventually becomes aware of the stare and looks up at him . SHE closes her book and puts it on the end table . ) Do you do it on purpose or what ? p. 47 LOUISE Do what on purpose ? JAKE She called you three or four times and you did n't answer . LOUISE Oh , is that what you 're upset about ? JAKE You acted as if you did n't hear her . LOUISE I did n't . JAKE You had to . LOUISE But I did n't . I was concentrating on Agatha Christie . JAKE And I was concentrating on these proofs . But I heard her . LOUISE O.K. , so I did n't hear her . So why are you getting so mad about it ? JAKE I 'm mad because you do n't even know it 's a problem . LOUISE What 's a problem ? Oh , really , Jake ! JAKE You do n't know how many times a day I witness this . I should have brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's not true . I always hear her . JAKE Not this time . LOUISE When it 's important I hear her . JAKE How do you know whether it 's important ? LOUISE I know . p. 48 JAKE Look , I do n't care if it 's important or not , when a kid calls its mother the mother should answer . LOUISE Now I 'm a bad mother . JAKE I did n't say that . LOUISE It 's in your stare . JAKE Is that another thing you know ? My stare ? LOUISE I 'm sorry if I 'm a bad mother . JAKE You 're not a bad mother . But you should n't make the child feel she 's ignored . LOUISE You 're not with her all day . JAKE Neither are you if you ignore her . LOUISE I do n't ignore her . My mind was on my book . You 're the one who gave it to me ! JAKE I want you to read . LOUISE I ca n't do two things at the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm involved I ca n't . JAKE That 's the most ridiculous statement I 've ever heard of . What if the house caught fire ? You mean if you were reading you would n't smell smoke ? If a bomb fell and you were reading you 'd just go on reading ? p. 49 LOUISE Oh , all right , you do n't want me to read so I wo n't read . JAKE I do want you to read . You stopped reading two years ago and I 've been trying to get you back to it ever since . And you know it . LOUISE O.K. then . ( Starts to pick up her book . ) JAKE That 's why I gave you Agatha Christie . LOUISE Jake  --  JAKE All you did for two years was lie around  --  LOUISE I was in a depression . JAKE and stare into space . LOUISE You know I was in a depression . JAKE I 'm in a depression right now . And I still read ! LOUISE I 'm my own person . JAKE Who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAKE You have made that perfectly clear . Any number of times . LOUISE Get a new wife ! JAKE Louise  --  LOUISE If I 'm such a terrible mother , do you want a divorce ? p. 50 JAKE I do not think you 're a terrible mother and no , thank you , I do not want a divorce . Why is it that whenever I bring up any difference between us you ask me if I want a divorce ? LOUISE You do n't have to stay with me if you do n't want to . JAKE You always do this ! LOUISE I ca n't help what I am . JAKE Yes , you can . LOUISE Well , if I can , why do n't you ? Why am I the only one who has to change ! JAKE I try ! I have n't had a drink in four months . LOUISE You 're disgusting when you drink . JAKE A cigarette in a year . Sure you can help what you are . I 'm a lot different from when you met me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not always different . JAKE Now , suddenly , I 'm not different . You use any argument that 's convenient . LOUISE You have a way of talking to me that makes me feel like a criminal . JAKE To you any criticism is a death blow . I tell you we do n't have any butter in the house , you ask me if I want a divorce . Why is it you can only react in extremes ? I have brought up one thing that you do with Edie that I do n't think you notice that I have noticed for some time but which I have deliberately not brought up before because I had hoped you would notice it for yourself and stop doing it and also  --  frankly , baby , I have to say this  --  I knew if I brought it up we 'd get into exactly the kind of circular argument we 're in right now . And I wanted to avoid it . But I have n't and we 're in it , so now , with your permission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOUISE You do n't see how that puts me down ? JAKE What ? LOUISE If you think I 'm so stupid why do you go on living with me ? JAKE Dammit ! Why ca n't anything ever be simple around here ? ! LOUISE Oh , all right . Have it your way . JAKE I do n't want it my way , I only want to talk about something you do with Edie . That 's all ! LOUISE That I ignore my child . Is that all ? JAKE Do n't you  --  Look  --  here 's what I mean . O.K. ? Here 's another example . She came in before and I do n't know what you were doing . You were n't reading . LOUISE Making your dinner . JAKE Did n't you eat dinner tonight ? Was n't it your dinner too ? LOUISE I do n't want to start a fight . JAKE Making my dinner . Jesus ! LOUISE Well , I was . You just do n't like to admit it . JAKE I admit it . LOUISE You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you made my fucking dinner ! Now can we get back to what we were talking about ? p. 52 LOUISE It 's an old story . What do you want , Jake ? JAKE Baby , what I want  --  I would like you to be more aware of what you do which you do n't intend to be harmful or without feeling but which comes over , whether you know it or not , as without feeling . LOUISE Oh , now I do n't love her . Is that it ? JAKE My mother loves me too . She pulled the same shit . LOUISE Goddammit , I 'm not your mother ! JAKE Thank God for that ! LOUISE You always compare me to your mother . JAKE No , I do n't . I compare Edie to me . I remember what it was like to be a kid . And Edie is a lot like me  --  thank God , not in too many ways  --  but enough ways . And I know she 's sensitive to a certain kind of behavior on your part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOUISE All right , what do I pull on her , Jake . Tell me , what do I pull ? JAKE What you pull is that you treat her as if she 's not there . LOUISE She 's always there . You 're the one who 's not there . She 's there and I 'm there . All day together . And you come home at night , drink your Tab and judge . p. 53 JAKE We 're not talking about what I do . We can talk about what I do later . Later I 'll be more than happy to talk about what I do . But first , if it 's possible , I would like to talk about what you do . Finally , if we can ever possibly manage it , that 's the subject I would dearly love to get to . LOUISE I will not be talked to that way . JAKE Damn it ! O.K. Look . This is doing neither of us any good . LOUISE You started it . JAKE Let me just say it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll say what I want to . Without interruption . You say what you want to after I finish . And it 'll be over and done with . LOUISE When you put it that way , O.K. Go ahead . JAKE Was my tone of voice acceptable that time ? LOUISE Screw you ! JAKE O.K. I admit I did it that time . That time , I know I did it . I could n't resist . I 'm sorry . LOUISE You can never resist . JAKE Sometimes you ask for it . LOUISE You talk about what I do to Edie , what do you think you do to me ? p. 54 JAKE This is not the time to go into what we each do to each other . LOUISE So I 'm a terrible wife too . A terrible wife and a terrible mother . I really do n't see why you do n't leave me . JAKE I swear to God  --  LOUISE O.K. Say what this terrible thing is I did . JAKE Edie comes into the kitchen . I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOUISE O.K. JAKE And she asked you five times if she could stay up late to watch Three 's Company . LOUISE It was n't five times JAKE And you never  --  You did n't answer . LOUISE It was n't five times , Jake . Do n't exaggerate . JAKE Three times ? LOUISE Twice . If it was even that much . JAKE Why did n't you answer ? LOUISE I do n't know why . My mind was on my cooking LOUISE Let her stay up to watch it . Is that what you want ? p. 55 JAKE Staying up late is not the issue . LOUISE Then she does n't get enough sleep and I ca n't get her up for school in the morning . You get her up for school sometime ! JAKE That 's not the point ! LOUISE It 's my point . JAKE It 's hopeless ! LOUISE Then get a divorce . JAKE I do n't want  --  LOUISE I do listen to her . Where were you when she broke her leg ? JAKE At work . LOUISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital ? Who stayed with her ? JAKE I 'm not denying that you 're good in emergencies . LOUISE You panicked ! JAKE I do n't deny you react better than I do in emergencies . I am terrible in emergencies . I grant you that . But the point is  --  LOUISE Your point , not mine . JAKE My point is that there is more to raising a child than being good in emergencies . Being good when there are no emergencies is equally important . My mother always used to tell me , " Do n't trust your friends . Only your family will be there when you need them . " And I used to tell her , " I also want people there when I do n't need them . That 's just as important . " p. 56 LOUISE I 'm not your mother ! JAKE It 's analogous . Do you want another example ? LOUISE I can give examples too , you know ! JAKE Not of that ! LOUISE Of other things ! JAKE Fine . But not when we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I still do n't see what I do that 's so bad .

EDIE You do n't want to help me . ( JAKE exits , discovers LOUISE on her knees retrieving and lining up pages of her paperback . ) LOUISE Why do n't you ever make her come to you ?

LOUISE Jake , do you know how scared you make me when you talk this way ? JAKE Just remember what happens to children of suicides . They often commit suicide too . So it 's not just you who dies  --  oh no  --  you 've also murdered your child . Is that what you want ? Hemingway 's father committed suicide ! Look , neither one of us is going to die .

JAKE Ah , but when you tell the truth you feel like you 're lying . MARILYN Very smart , my brother . Does n't the chauffeur get offered a drink ? JAKE If you 're driving , milk . MARILYN If you 're not kidding , drop dead . EDIE Your beard scratches , Grandpa ! LOUISE Why is everyone standing at the door ? Leaving so soon ? Come in ! Come in ! Jake , do you mind getting the drinks ? ( JAKE starts off . ) MARILYN I 'll supervise .

Is that a new suit ? JACK ( Proudly . ) Twenty-five years old . LOUISE I wish I could get Jake to pay as much attention to clothes as you do . JACK Jake ? I had to dress him until he was twenty-one . Then he was too grown up to go shopping with his father . LOUISE You look wonderful . It 's good to see you . You wo n't believe this , but you look younger than you did before you went into the hospital . JACK I get out of breath , it 's the only change . Otherwise I feel like  --  LOUISE Well , Helen had better watch herself or some woman will start making eyes at you . JACK That 's the silliest thing I ever heard of . LOUISE I honestly mean it . You do n't know the kind of females out on the loose today . JACK Edie , when are you going to come home with Grandpa ? p. 75 JAKE ( Enters with MARILYN . ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JACK Louise was pulling the old man 's leg . LOUISE No , I was n't . JAKE No , she was n't . Louise does n't have a sense of humor .

We got it last winter . MARILYN To me it 's new . It looks so cheerful in here . I love your taste . Edie , do you like the sweater or do I take it back ? EDIE I like it . MARILYN So what do you say ? EDIE Thank you . ( Curtsies . ) Do I get to keep it now ? MARILYN ( Laughs . ) The kid 's a riot ! JACK Edie , try the sweater on for Grandpa , Edie .

JACK So what do you have to say for yourself , young fellow ? HELEN ( Enters with present . ) It 's all so bright in here . You 've built yourself a veritable Shangri-La , Louise . Who ever dreamed we 'd find Shangri-La on West End Avenue , Dad ? JAKE Hey , Ma , Dad does n't want to tell me what 's new . JACK ( Laughs . ) Son-of-a-gun ! Do n't think I 'm not on to you .

I 'm holding it in my hand and completely forgot about it . Where 's that Edie ? ( ALL laugh because EDIE is right behind her . HELEN , momentarily confused , turns and sees her . ) Can you beat it ? ! Look at us , gang , we 're a vaudeville team . ( EDIE reaches for present . HELEN switches it from hand to hand as EDIE jumps for it , BOTH consciously putting on a show . ) A jumping jack ! Can you beat it ? ( HELEN finally relinquishes present . ) I surrender ! ( To OTHERS , clasps her hands to bosom , sings . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as attention remains on EDIE tearing open her present . ) You 'd think her life depended on it .

EDIE I really like it . I 'm not lying . HELEN If you keep this one , when you come to our house to stay over , Grandma will take you to B. Dalton and you can buy any book you like . Give me a hug . ( EDIE hugs her . ) A real squeeze . That 's more like it ! You know , Edie , when I was a little girl you know what I dreamed of getting more than anything else ? ( Pause . ) LOUISE Ask her what , darling . EDIE What ? HELEN A library card . My very own library card . Because to me the library was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library card was the key . Do you have a library card ? EDIE Somewhere . HELEN Show it to Grandma . EDIE I do n't know where it is . HELEN Never lose your library card . It 's one of your most valued possessions . LOUISE That 's not always true , Helen . I spent more money on the library than I did on buying books . p. 80 HELEN How did you manage that ? LOUISE I was too lazy to take anything back . Oh , I kept books out for years ! I finally owed so much they took away my card . HELEN A misspent youth . Jake , you never told me you married a juvenile delinquent . LOUISE I honestly was ! I raided that library ! I got away with more books than when I had a card . HELEN That 's not a very good lesson to teach your daughter . LOUISE Oh , Helen , do n't you have any of the adventurer in you ? The books I snitched  --  JAKE Snatched . LOUISE ( Ignores him. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Jane Austen was swiped from the library . HELEN I do n't find this the least bit amusing . LOUISE Oh , come on , Helen , you must , buried deep within you , have a little larceny in your heart . Confess ! HELEN Do n't think I do n't know the sort of fashionable thinking that goes today . I do n't find it funny . And I do n't think it 's good conversation to have in front of children . Even in jest . LOUISE But , do n't you see , Helen , that 's where your ideas of child rearing differ from ours . Your generation hid things . We believe in being out in the open . p. 81 HELEN ( To JAKE . ) What did I hide ? I had so much to hide ? LOUISE Oh , you know what I mean . HELEN I 'm sorry to say you 're way over my head . LOUISE Helen , I 'm afraid you and I have a communications gap . HELEN ( To JACK . ) Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a vicious attack on libraries . HELEN It 's gibberish to me . JAKE Mama is Honest Abe , Louise is Mack the Knife . LOUISE Mack the Knife . I like that ! JAKE I take a middle position . I never went to the library . I assumed they would n't have what I wanted . MARILYN Denial is the spice of life . JAKE But I was never overdue . MARILYN You make a habit out of being overdue . JAKE But not at the library . MARILYN That I concede . JAKE At the library I 'm clean . Are n't you proud of me , Mama ? p. 82 HELEN You 're all out of my depth today . What 's the matter with this gang ? JACK ( To EDIE . ) Where are you going , darling ? EDIE I want to count my books . ( Exits to bedroom . ) JAKE As long as we 're on the subject of books  --  ( Crosses to desk , takes out proof of his book jacket . Hands it to JACK . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket . Four hundred twenty-four pages go in between . HELEN What is it ? Dad , let me see . LOUISE It 's Jake 's book . HELEN Already ? Out already ? LOUISE The pub date is n't for another three months , Helen . HELEN Pub date ? LOUISE Publication date . HELEN You coulda fooled me , kid . I thought you meant a date to go drinking . JACK ( Studying jacket . ) Well , I 'll be damned . Well , I 'll be damned . Your name is almost as big as the title . HELEN Why not ? p. 83 JACK And this is the way they 're going to let it look when it goes in the bookstores ? JAKE Dad , that 's the cover . A proof of the cover . That 's exactly what it 's going to look like . JACK You dirty son-of-a-gun ! I ask you what 's new and you hold out on me ! HELEN ( Examining jacket . ) Jake , you 'll be another David Halberstam . JAKE He likes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Halberstam read your book ? JAKE He 's going to give me a quote . HELEN I 'm so excited I can hardly breathe . JACK Well , I 'll be damned ! I 'll be damned . You worked hard , Sonny boy , but it 's paid off . Will you look at that book , Ma ? ( THEY hold the jacket between them . ) HELEN It 's a beautiful book . JAKE Galbraith is going to give me a quote . JACK You do n't mean it ! HELEN David Halberstam and John Kenneth Galbraith . Oh , Sonny , there are tears in my eyes . ( To LOUISE . ) When he was no older than six , Dad taught him to fold the New York Times . The coincidence ! Who ever dreamed he 'd be working for them ? The patience it took . Jake wanted to fold it all at once . He could n't wait . The mess he made of it . Dad showed him , no , you do it a little at a time , column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tiny face . I 've often wondered if the patience to write a book is n't rooted in that childhood lesson . p. 84 JACK Do n't be silly . HELEN It 's not such a crazy idea . The book I could write , I could teach you all a thing or two . And it would n't be about the world 's business . I would n't have to go outside my own home . Now it can be told ! What do you think of that , Jake ? Your ma , a writerkeh ? ( Dopey voice . ) And I would n't want no help neither . ( To LOUISE . ) Jake would never take any help . One of Dad 's best customers is a printer on the Times . But Jake would n't let us ask him to get him a job . You always had to do everything yourself , Jake . JAKE I bet you could write a best seller , Ma . HELEN Do n't laugh . I could yet . MARILYN How come nobody ever gave me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has a few tricks in her . LOUISE What would you write , Helen ? Tell us some juicy gossip . HELEN If I once open my mouth  --  LOUISE Come on , Helen , do n't be a tease . I want to hear all the dirt . HELEN Dirt I leave to others to write . LOUISE Now do n't cop out . p. 85 HELEN ( To JACK . ) Cop in . Cop out . Do you know what she 's talking about ? LOUISE I want to hear about all the skeletons in your closet . HELEN Rattle . Rattle . Louise , I ca n't keep up with you . You want dirt ? I 'll tell you a dirty story . See , I can be as up to date as the rest of them . Listen my children and you shall hear ! LOUISE This should be good ! HELEN I was in Waldbaum 's last week . A very respectable looking old man comes up to me and without so much as a by-your-leave he starts serenading me . Me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's singing me a love song ! Eighty if he 's a day ! ( Sings . ) " If you were the only girl in the world and I was the only boy " Can you imagine such chutzpa ? He was n't drunk either . Is that dirt enough for you , Louise ? LOUISE Helen , I always suspected it . You 're an old flirt . HELEN Girl , have you got the wrong number . LOUISE I do n't know , Helen , I 've always suspected you hide a juicy secret life . HELEN I 've Got a Secret . ( To JACK . ) Do you know what she 's talking about ? p. 86 JAKE O.K. , that 's enough , Louise . LOUISE What am I doing ? JAKE You know what you 're doing . HELEN I can go along with a gag . LOUISE Helen and I are having a pleasant chat . Why do you have to put your ten cents in ? JAKE It 's two cents . LOUISE Who cares ? JAKE Try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliches . You 're cliche enough . JAKE You 're right . I 'm wrong . Let 's forget it . LOUISE ( To HELEN . ) He does n't approve of the way I talk . JAKE I thought we agreed to forget it . LOUISE Oh , I can forget a lot more than that . You know what he decided to start a lecture on ? ( Turns away from HELEN . ) You 're a mother , Marilyn , you should appreciate this : He tells me I do n't answer when Edie calls . JAKE Louise , she can hear you . LOUISE Big deal . He tells me I 'm a terrible mother because when his daughter commands I do n't flip to attention . p. 87 JAKE You do n't what ? Flip to attention ? LOUISE Flip to attention . Everyone knows what flip to attention means . JAKE Maybe they can interpret what it means , but you are not speaking English . It is simply not English . LOUISE Now what are you so upset about ? JAKE I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great length to make me look idiotic in front of company . JACK That 's us , I suppose . We 're " company . " LOUISE ( To JACK . ) Do n't mind him . I do n't . JACK ( Rises . ) " The company " is going to visit his granddaughter . JAKE Do n't , Dad . Her door is closed . LOUISE Then how could she hear me ? ( To MARILYN . ) He should have been an English teacher . JACK So her door is closed . JAKE When her door is closed it means she wants to be alone . HELEN " I vaunt to be alone . " Some house this is . JACK I come all the way from Riverdale to see my granddaughter and I ca n't see her because her door is closed . That 's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of . p. 88 JAKE Dad , I know you do n't respect privacy in your house but in this house we do respect it . JACK That 's some hell of a remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , has it ? HELEN Listen , if we gave you all the privacy you wanted , to this day you would n't know a soul . JAKE All I 'm saying is sometimes you need a little relief from other people . JACK I am not " other people " and I am not " company . " JAKE She 'll come out to see you when she 's ready . LOUISE See what I mean ? JACK I am her grandfather ! JAKE In my entire childhood nobody ever knocked before they came into my room . HELEN What was so precious you had to hide from us ? JAKE That 's not the point . HELEN You were lucky you had a room . JAKE That also is not the point . HELEN Who paid rent on that room ? That I ask you . JAKE O.K. , but you 're not paying rent on Edie 's room . p. 89 HELEN If we did n't pay rent on your room , Edie would n't have a room for you to pay rent on . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of temperament just because I bought her a book she does n't want . She should learn to appreciate the thought behind the gift . JAKE Like you , I suppose ? HELEN You can teach Louise English , I can still teach my son a few manners : Do n't be fresh . JAKE Mama , you never knew how to receive a gift , how can you criticize Edie ? JACK " Other people " ? That really makes me see red ! JAKE Never ! Every single time I have ever bought you a present  --  I 'd save pennies , nickels , dimes  --  what was your reaction ? Every single time ! " How much did it cost ? When did you buy it ? What do I need if for ? Will they take it back ? " HELEN It 's not true . JAKE Oh , but it is true . JACK " Other people " ! Where do you get off , Jake ? I 'm her grandfather , I 'm your father , I knew you even before you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me " other people " ? JAKE You 're other people to Edie , Dad , not to me . JACK Maybe if I saw her more than twice a year I would n't be " other people . " p. 90 JAKE You 're seeing her now . Why do you always  --  JACK If I 'm seeing her now , where is she ? Point her out . You mean that closed door there that I ca n't knock on and ask if I can go in . Is that her ? Is that what you mean when you say I 'm seeing her now ? JAKE No one said you could n't knock and ask if you can go in . JACK I have your permission . JAKE You do n't need my permission . JACK Thank you very much . JAKE All you needed me for was to introduce you to the concept of knocking on a door . ( Knocks on the table . ) It 's easy , see ? And then she says , " Come in , " and you 're not interfering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAKE I 'm almost positive . JACK I would n't want to interfere . ( Starts for EDIE 'S room . ) HELEN Jack , do n't . It 's very obvious you 're not welcome . JAKE He is welcome . JACK You know what I think ? I do n't think he knows what he wants . p. 91 JAKE Dad , I want you to knock on the door . JACK Thank you . HELEN Jack , do n't . JACK Do n't worry about a thing . HELEN I forbid it . JACK What 's gotten into you ? JAKE Oh , for Christ 's sake , Mama ! HELEN You do n't have to knock on any doors . I wo n't put up with this humiliation . JACK I 'm not humiliated , why should you be humiliated ? All I want to do is see my granddaughter . HELEN Your problem is you have to be told when you 're humiliated . Nothing changes with you . JACK You do n't know what you 're talking about . HELEN I forbid you to knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're satisfied , Jake . LOUISE Can everyone please calm down . Really , there 's nothing to get hysterical about . MARILYN Take it easy , Louise . LOUISE Why should I be the one who has to be told to take it easy ? p. 92 MARILYN Because they ca n't help it and you can . LOUISE They do n't want to help it . MARILYN Same thing . LOUISE So I have to shut up . MARILYN So do n't shut up . LOUISE Everyone finds it so easy to give orders in my house . MARILYN I apologize for opening my mouth . HELEN You 've got a lot to learn , Jake . You 're going to spoil that child . You 're going to have a lot of trouble on your hands in a few years , Jake , believe you me . JAKE Mama , I do n't think you 're necessarily the best source of advice on the question of child raising . HELEN I did so bad with my son ? MARILYN I 'm here too , folks ! HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is this the price of success ? JAKE Mama , I know you think you did your best . But I also know how I felt . Are you interested in learning how I felt ? HELEN Why should I be interested when I know it 'll come out against me ? JAKE I 'll tell you anyhow . p. 93 LOUISE Poor Jake . HELEN All children feel that way . You 're not so special . JAKE Mama , you do n't know how all children feel . You ca n't ! Because you have never known how one specific child feels . JACK Who could keep up with all your moods ? JAKE ( To JACK . ) You always take her side ! When Uncle Eugene gave me a watch for my fourteenth birthday  --  Mama came into my room  --  without knocking . ( To HELEN . ) You saw me holding the watch  --  my first grown-up watch , not a Mickey Mouse , a real seventeen-jeweled watch  --  ( To JACK . ) She took it out of my hands . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is a very expensive watch your uncle gave you , Jake . You must treat it with respect and care . " And she started to wind it . You ca n't have forgotten this . She gave me a lecture on how to wind a watch . ( Throughout , JAKE is miming the winding of a watch . ) " You 've got to be very careful , Jake , very responsible , once a day , do n't overwind  --  " ( JAKE mimes the stem coming out of the watch , mimes HELEN looking down in shock at the stem in her hand . ) And out it comes , the stem ! She runs to you in the kitchen reading your newspaper and she screams , " Look what Jake did ! " Naturally , naturally you believed her . When it was a fight with strangers , you believed the strangers , so why not Mama ? Between me and any grownup you believed the grownup. p. 94 JACK You do n't know what you 're talking about . HELEN You did break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't matter . I was using it as an illustration . HELEN You were playing with it ; you loosened it , Jake . Sonny , why are you doing this ? JAKE What I 'm saying is do n't tell me what Edie 's going to have to deal with when she grows up . JACK I ca n't listen to any more of this nonsense . ( Looks for a door to leave by . ) JAKE Never once did you support me in anything . You know that 's true . JACK Boloney ! We support you all the time . JAKE After I made it on the Times ! I had to make it with strangers in order to get accepted by my mother and father . Jesus Christ ! HELEN You 've gotten hard , Jake . JAKE What do yo think it feels like to be asked : " What 's new ? " all the time . " What 's new ? " " I was on page one of the Times , " not enough . " What 's new ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ! Oh , sonny boy ! JACK Cut it out , he 's not serious . p. 95 JAKE No , I 'm not serious , goddamn it ! Christ , if I do n't have anything new to report  --  JACK I 'm ashamed I was proud of you . You want me to be ashamed ? Well , I am ashamed . JAKE You do n't get it , do you ? JACK I get it . You want our support but you do n't want us to be proud of you . It 's very simple . What 's not to understand ? JAKE O.K. , you want to know what 's new ? JACK I do n't want to know . I 'll never ask again . JAKE No , I 'll tell you what 's new . JACK I 'm not interested . JAKE This morning , not an hour before you got here , Louise and I decided to separate . MARILYN Christ ! LOUISE You decided . JAKE I decided . Tonight after you leave , I leave . That 's what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Turns away . ) I do n't want to hear another word . HELEN Is this true , Louise ? LOUISE Do n't look at me . ( To JAKE . ) We agreed not to , Jake . ( To HELEN . ) I have nothing to do with this . p. 96 HELEN Now I understand why the commotion . Jake , sit down , Jake . Come , sonny boy , sit beside me . JAKE Not now , Mama . HELEN This is a tragedy , Jake . JAKE It 's no tragedy , it happens all the time . HELEN To your child , to your home ? No , not all the time , sonny boy . JAKE One out of three marriages end up in divorce . That 's a fact of life , not a tragedy . HELEN What 's turned you so cold , Sonny , that you can talk this way after you do such a thing ? Did Louise do something I should know about ? JAKE Leave Louise out of this . HELEN Sonny boy , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Nothing happened . ( HELEN takes his hand . ) HELEN It 's not that you do n't want to tell me ? JAKE You 're on the wrong track , Mama . HELEN She did n't do the unmentionable ? LOUISE Helen , I resent that . HELEN ( To JAKE . ) Do n't tell me you 're doing anything to be ashamed of ? p. 97 JAKE No , Mama , I am not screwing around . HELEN ( Withdraws her hand . ) Less talk like that and you might not be endangering your home . Jake , I 'm no dope . I know what goes on . Be strong , sonny boy . JACK He 'll do what he wants . Do n't waste your breath . HELEN Whenever you had a problem we 'd sit down , we 'd talk it out . JAKE I 'm not sixteen anymore , Mama . JACK Big shot ! HELEN Who can you talk to if not your parents , Jake ? JAKE Mama , this is pure fantasy on your part . HELEN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . HELEN Why is he leaving ? LOUISE He wo n't tell me . JAKE That 's not true . LOUISE We really have n't talked at all about it , Jake . You know that 's true . JAKE We talked all morning about it . LOUISE Well , I did n't understand a word you were saying . p. 98 JAKE Because you do n't know how to listen . LOUISE Because you do n't know yourself , or you 're not telling me the truth . If you want my opinion  --  JAKE You do n't have to broadcast it . JACK Now we 're a " broadcast " ! He 's got some gall ! HELEN Calm down , Jack . JACK Never mind about me . HELEN Do n't lose your breath . You look grey . JAKE Mama , will you stop implying that I 'm killing him . HELEN You think this is doing him good ? Two months out of the hospital . How often did you come around ? JAKE Once a week . JACK One hour exactly . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there fast enough . JAKE All you ever wanted to talk about was " What 's new ? " JACK I had a heart attack , what did you want me to talk about ? JAKE We have never had a conversation in our lives . JACK Boloney ! JAKE Every time I ask you anything about yourself you ask me " What 's new ? " p. 99 JACK Who needs a reporter in the hospital ? The way you ask , it 's like it 's going to be printed in the Times . MARILYN If anybody wants to know what I think , I think Jake and Louise should be left alone to settle this by themselves . HELEN Marilyn , be a good girl , get your father a cup of tea . JACK I do n't want tea . HELEN Do what I ask , Marilyn . JACK I want a drink . HELEN See , Jake ? Need I say more ? MARILYN Scotch , Daddy ? HELEN Marilyn , I forbid it . MARILYN One drink is n't going to make that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , one divorce . It all makes a difference , Marilyn , dear . Listen to me for a change , I was n't born yesterday . Where are you going , I 'm not finished . MARILYN Dad 's not the only one who needs a drink . ( Exits . ) HELEN You too ? ! ( To JAKE . ) An epidemic ! Weaklings ! Is that what I brought up ? JACK What 's going to happen to that poor baby ? p. 100 JAKE That 's our business . JACK I 'm not talking to you . JAKE Edie is my main concern in this matter . LOUISE Naturally . JAKE I did n't mean you were n't my concern . I meant that you and I together would see that Edie came out of this all right . HELEN You ca n't tell her , Jake . Oh , Sonny  --  JAKE Mama , she has to be told why her father is moving out . HELEN Well , so tell her you 're going away for a while . To do research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! HELEN You used to be such a beautiful child , Sonny . What 's made you so selfish ? JAKE Look , you do n't understand . I did n't make this decision overnight . It is a matter of saving my life . Now does that mean anything to you , Mama , Dad ? Saving my life ? Then you might for once try giving me a little support . ( Mimicking commercial . ) " Try it , you 'll like it ! " LOUISE I 've destroyed his life . JAKE I did n't say that . LOUISE You ca n't deny I always supported you , Jake . p. 101 JAKE That 's true , you have . It 's more complicated than that . LOUISE Is that the only explanation I get ? " It 's more complicated than that " ? That 's all he tells me . I ca n't find a clue out from him . Do you want younger women ? I 'm willing to discuss it . I know about male menopause . HELEN I ca n't believe my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody ! JACK Be careful ! Do n't " broadcast " to " other people " ! JAKE Look , I did not mean for this to turn into a seminar on the subject of divorce . HELEN Divorce ? ! No , Jake ! JAKE All I know is that I have to get out . MARILYN ( Enters with drinks . ) Dad . HELEN Defy me . Everyone defy me ! ( MARILYN drinks . JACK , after some hesitation , drinks , starts to cough , chokes . ALL run to his side , slap his back , hold his arms up . HE finally recovers . ) Are you all right ? JACK ( Weak . ) Fine . HELEN Lie down . JACK I do n't have to . p. 102 HELEN I 'm not taking any more nonsense from you , young man . Lie down . ( JACK stretches out on couch . HELEN takes empty glass from his hand , looks at JAKE in disgust . ) MARILYN Do n't look at Jake , Mama , I gave him the drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of yourself . MARILYN Mama , it 's my fault , not Jake 's HELEN ( To JAKE . ) You 'll ruin your life . JAKE You do n't know the first thing about my life . HELEN How many times did we have to sit you down when you wanted to go off half cocked and talk some sense into your head ? JAKE That was n't sense , it was fear . All my life you have been able to reason me out of everything I wanted to do . HELEN Did we stop you from going on the Times ? JAKE I hate the Times ! JACK I ca n't believe it . I wo n't believe it HELEN Sonny , why are you doing this ? LOUISE Oh , let him have his fling . See if I care ! p. 103 HELEN Who 's been putting ideas in your head , Jake ? LOUISE You used to say I was the first person you ever met who supported you . JAKE In my work . In my work . LOUISE Oh , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Louise ? LOUISE An unworthy mother . JAKE You 're a broken record , you know that ? LOUISE Or is is that I 'm not smart enough for your new friends ? JAKE I need new friends , you got rid of all my old friends ! LOUISE Screw you ! You did n't like them anymore than I did ! HELEN Children ! JAKE I liked them fine until you started picking them apart ! LOUISE Who gives a shit ! You can have all the friends you want ! Just do n't see them around me . JAKE This happens to be my home . I 'd like the freedom to invite my friends to my own home . LOUISE I suppose you do n't hate my friends ? JAKE But do I stop you from seeing them ? p. 104 LOUISE Because you do n't have to be here ! JAKE What 's the use ? They 're not interested in this . MARILYN I do n't think this is getting us anywhere . Mama , Daddy , I think it 's time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new again . That 's a promise . HELEN ( To JAKE . ) He looks terrible . Look at your father . MARILYN Did you hear me ? We are now going home . ( Puts down drink , goes to hall closet . ) LOUISE I could n't go near you because you were working . What am I supposed to do ? I have to talk to somebody . JAKE Every time I tried to read you a new paragraph I had to wait till you got off the telephone . MARILYN ( Her coat on . ) Is anyone coming with me ? I mean it , I ca n't stand any more of this . I 'm leaving . Who 's coming ? LOUISE That 's all you ever do is read to me . JAKE You sure as hell do n't read to yourself . LOUISE And if I do n't like what you wrote you go crazy ! You ca n't take criticism . p. 105 JAKE It 's the way you criticize ! MARILYN O.K. , folks . Mama , Daddy . LOUISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . JAKE You can be right without being hostile ! LOUISE I 'm not hostile ! I know you 're going to jump down my neck ! MARILYN The chauffeur has her coat on . Last call . JACK ( Sits up . ) You never could talk to him . I tried . He does n't know what he 's talking about . HELEN Lie down , Jack . MARILYN Would anyone like to say goodbye ? JACK Who the hell do you think you are ? HELEN Jack , mind your p 's and q 's . MARILYN No ? I did n't think so . JACK The ingratitude ! He deserves a piece of my mind . HELEN Only do n't get excited . MARILYN ( Opens door . ) Thanks a lot . From now on take a taxi ! ( Exits as JACK rises , crosses to JAKE. ) p. 106 JACK How many times do you visit in a year ? How many times ? How many times ? You 're too damned important . Three times !
