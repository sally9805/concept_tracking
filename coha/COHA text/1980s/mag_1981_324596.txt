The country 's worst race riot <P> It was the kind of warm spring Saturday afternoon that draws all of London into the streets . As two bobbies pounded their beat in Brixton , a grimy , racially mixed neighborhood south of the Thames , they stopped to question a black youth . A hostile crowd gathered , and suddenly all hell seemed to break loose . Rocks , bricks and Molotov cocktails began to fly . As police reinforcements rushed in , an orgy of burning and looting swept down Railton Road , a principal neighborhood shopping avenue , leaving automobiles gutted and shops in flames . Streets were littered with looted appliances , clothing and costume jewelry . At the peak of the violence , more than 1,000 police in riot gear , huddled like Roman legionnaires behind shields , battled some 600 black West Indian youths , interspersed with a few masked white rioters . <P> When the hurricane of violence ended after five brutal hours , the toll was heavy : 165 policemen injured-26 requiring hospitalization-along with scores of civilians . Nearly 100 rioters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $2.2 million . Beyond the burnt buildings and ravaged streets twinkling with shards of glass from shattered storefront windows , however , London now bears a more lasting scar : the psychic damage from the worst race riot in British history , an ugly explosion reminiscent of the violence that tore apart dozens of American cities in the ' 60s and , only eleven months ago , left whole sections of Miami in flames . <P> Many local residents were quick to say that racial tensions were not involved , blaming soured police-neighborhood relations and Britain 's current grim unemployment problem . Said one Brixton dweller : " This is not a race riot . We are not here to hurt white people . It is about jobs , money , all the rest . You can only take so much . " But the fact is that tension has been building for months in Brixton , home of many of the 620,000 black West Indians who have immigrated to Britain , or been born there , since the 1950s . As in the U.S. , racial friction and unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas like Brixton is twice Britain 's 10.3% national average . <P> Residents have long chafed at local police use of a 150-year-old loitering statute that allows them to detain anyone they believe intends to commit a crime ; studies show that the law is ten times as likely to be used against blacks as whites . In February about 10,000 demonstrators , including many from Brixton , marched peacefully in nearby Deptford to protest what they considered deliberately lethargic police investigation of the deaths of two young blacks in a fire . The latest spark appears to have been struck the evening before the rioting , when blacks accused police of failing to respond quickly enough after a black Brixton man was stabbed to death .
