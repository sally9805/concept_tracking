The hearth dominates American playwriting . Of the nation 's foremost dramatists  --  the likes of Thornton Wilder , Eugene O'Neill , Tennessee Williams and the early Edward Albee  --  only Arthur Miller has consistently reached out beyond domestic grief to comment on public life . For that aspiration , Miller has often been rebuked and advised to return to family melodrama . Probably no rejection hurt more than the fate of his The American Clock , a poignant panorama of what the 1930s did to the country 's psyche ; it opened on Broadway in November 1980 and lasted barely two weeks . Miller has not brought a new play there since . <P> In 1984 Miller rewrote the show , and last week Britain 's National Theater gave it a handsomely designed , intelligently acted and altogether persuasive production  --  not a revival , because in content , style and spirit this Clock amounts to new work . It is a robust , expressionistic celebration of a time that tore America apart yet paradoxically brought it together , an all but unique moment when millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To reinvigorate the text , Miller and Director Peter Wood have gone back to its beginnings . The inspiration for the piece , Miller acknowledges , was Studs Terkel 's sprawling oral history Hard Times . But during pre-Broadway workshops and a Charleston , S.C. , tryout , Miller was repeatedly counseled by critics to shift emphasis from a documentary-style montage of vignettes to a focus on a particular family , resembling his own , whose growing deprivation and humiliation reflected the Depression in microcosm . These semiautobiographical characters proved unable by themselves to bear the weight of enormous events ; meanwhile , the play 's sweep had been diminished , and the tinkering , especially the search for jokes , had drained Clock of guts and vitality . <P> The London production 's metaphoric intentions are evident the moment the audience sees the backdrop . A lurid , scrawled red line divides a vista of white-capped mountains and a blue sky with clouds from a rough black collage below , inset with garbage cans , pails , tires and a metal ladder  --  the dregs beneath the American Dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward from the Crash into World War II and briefly into 1968 and beyond . The cast of 19 enact dozens of the dispossessed , from a desperate Southern sheriff no longer receiving a paycheck to college boys afraid to graduate into an unwelcoming world , from a ruined multimillionaire to a scrounging hobo . These are often archetypes , but just as often their circumstances have been drawn from historical record . The documentary aura is heightened by two dozen popular songs ironically interposed ( The Joint Is Jumpin ' , How Long Blues , Sittin ' Around ) . <P> In the second act , where the Broadway version bogged down in depiction of the family 's fate , the narrative confidently shifts into analysis of the American character  --  the need for belief and common purpose and even catastrophe to shake people out of self-absorption . As Lee Baum , the author 's surrogate , Neil Daglish is touching , introspective and believably American .
