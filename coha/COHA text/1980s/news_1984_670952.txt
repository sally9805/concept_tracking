It was the most ambitious of more than a dozen studies by various groups trying to measure and analyze the effects of what some have called " the Reagan revolution . " Many of the studies have been hurled as brickbats by politicians attacking or defending the fairness of Mr. Reagan ' s policies. // Major studies in this vein have come from the Congressional Budget Office , the General Accounting Office , the Congressional Research Service , the Census Bureau , the Urban and Regional Research Center of Princeton University , the Center for the Study of Social Policy , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. // // An Integral Part of the Capital // // Such research organizations are an integral part of Washington . They provide the fodder for many speeches and legislative proposals . They are a permanent home for some policy analysts , but also a way station for people who have served or wish to serve in Government. // Many of the researchers want to influence Federal policy . Some want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever the case for the current batch of studies , President Reagan presented a ripe target for the scholars and researchers because he announced in advance that he would make a dramatic departure from many policies of the past. // How should such studies be read ? How much credence do they deserve ? // Such studies sometimes have significant results . The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 , which established the Federal budget process as it now exists , is sometimes seen as an outgrowth of work done at the Brookings Institution . The Reagan Administration , in turn , took many cues from a report issued in 1981 by the Heritage Foundation. // The studies are a combination of economic analysis , program evaluation , political commentary and the authors ' personal opinions . They vary widely in methodological rigor . <> <> ' Everybody Wants Data ' // // The private studies , in particular , often sound more scientific than they are . But much of the analysis is professional and competent , according to experts on social science research and evaluation techniques , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody has become a social scientist , " said Irving Louis Horowitz , professor of political science and sociology at Rutgers Univeristy , who wrote a book titled " The Use and Abuse of Social Science . " Nowadays , he said , " everybody wants data , information , systematic theorizing , not just random opinions. " // The Census Bureau is generally credited with setting the standard for studies when it comes to the use of rigorous techniques . Its annual report on income and poverty , based on interviews with 62 , 000 households , contains an appendix describing the " source and reliability of the estimates , " the underreporting of income and the problems inherent in trying to draw valid conclusions from just a sample of the population , however large. // Such elaborate discussions of methodology are rare in other studies , an omission that concerns Paul E. Peterson , director of the governmental studies program at the Brookings Institution . " That ' s the crucial section , " he said . " That ' s the thing you have to read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <> <> Rigorous and Scrupulous // // The most rigorous studies are also the most scrupulous in describing their own limits , and such candid confessions tend to enhance a reader ' s confidence in the validity of the study. // Readers and writers sometimes neglect to distinguish between actual survey data , collected by the Census Bureau or other agencies , and computer projections based on mathematical models of the economy and the population . A recent study by the Congressional Research Service estimated that at least 557 , 000 people were made poor as a result of budget restrictions in social programs since President Reagan took office . However , no one actually counted these people ; the figure was derived from a computer " simulation " of what would have happened in the absence of the program changes. // Similarly , the Urban Institute reported that the average income of the poorest one-fifth of all families declined nearly 8 percent , from $6 , 913 in 1980 to $6 , 391 in 1984 , while the average for the most affluent one-fifth of the populace rose nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers were less precise than the text might suggest . Economists at the Urban Institute said later , in interviews , that the 1984 figures were obtained by putting 1982 data into a computer model , then adjusting each family ' s income to take account of changes in overall levels of employment , increases in various sources of income and changes in Government benefit programs. // Even when there is no dispute over the accuracy of the data , different researchers may emphasize different themes . <> <> Analyzing the Poverty Rate // // On Aug. 2 the Census Bureau issued a report saying that " the poverty rate in 1983 was 15. 2 percent , not statistically different from the previous year ' s 15 percent . " Within hours , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , headed by Robert Greenstein , a former Carter Administration official , issued an analysis of the same data saying that the poverty rate had reached a 19-year high , that " the poor are getting poorer " and that one out of every two black children under the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tips for judging whether reports on the Reagan Administration were as professional and objective as they purport to be : // // - Look for evidence that runs counter to intuition or to the general trend . If the authors neglect to present such " disconfirming evidence , " they may be more interested in scoring political points than in ascertaining the truth. // // - If there were questionnaires or interviews , what was the response rate ? Federal laws explicitly authorize the Census Bureau and the General Accounting Office to collect information , but private researchers must rely on voluntary cooperation , which often lags. // // - Do the researchers ever admit that the evidence is equivocal or inconclusive ? Prof. Robert F. Boruch , director of the Center for Statistics and Probability at Northwestern University , said , " It requires audacity and some courage to say , ' I don ' t know. ' " // // - Are the conclusions of one study supported by the findings of other studies that use different research techniques ? // To a remarkable degree , the studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Princeton University and the Center for the Study of Social Policy agree that Mr. Reagan ' s policies have adversely affected working poor people . The studies use a wide variety of techniques : interviews with state welfare officials and poor people ; analysis of economic , program and budget data , and computer models designed to simulate the experience of individual households. // The Reagan Administration has attacked many studies of its domestic social policies as biased and unprofessional . But the Administration ' s own studies , used to rebut the critics , get little respect from private researchers , and the Federal Government in the last three years has cut back on collection of the statistics needed to measure the effects of Federal policies with greater accuracy. //
