It 's official : the world 's biggest car company is a clunker . THE WRECK OF GENERAL MOTORS BY JAMES K. GLASSMAN HARDLY AN UNIMPEACHABLE source , John Z. DeLorean was right about one thing . He knew what was wrong with General Motors . It was swollen and stuffy , dominated by financial types instead of engineers , and " incapable of changing . " DeLorean said in 1979 , " There is virtually no likelihood of outsiders taking over the management of General Motors . " Two weeks ago , an outsider who did have some likelihood of taking over the management of General Motors ? or at least of changing it ? was bought off for $743 million . Henry Ross Perot , GM 's biggest shareholder , had become a pest . " Push , push , push . Harder , harder , harder . That 's my nature , " he would say . He was going around criticizing the management publicly for treating its workers poorly and for being inefficient . " It takes five years to develop a new car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we won World War II in four years . " Roger Smith , GM 's chairman , decided he had had enough . He offered Perot twice the market price of his stock to get Perot out of his hair . Shelling out three-quarters of a billion dollars is not something that GM is in a great position to do these days . The company had a pretax loss of $364 million in the third quarter . This year , for the first time since 1924 , GM will make less money than Ford . But Smith and his board dipped into the GM treasury , and Ross Perot agreed to leave quietly ( there 's a $7.5 million fine if he criticizes GM ) . He also promised not to buy any GM stock or try to take over the company for five years . Even for the third-richest man in America , $743 million is hard to resist . Perot , in a typical flourish , then put the money in an escrow account until December 15 " in order to give the GM directors time to review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are current or former GM executives and seven are retired chairmen of other companies . It 's hardly a feisty group . These directors really do n't need any extra time to think it over . They were very happy to see this irritating little man take a walk . This was n't your typical greenmail deal . Perot was n't trying to buy out the stockholders of GM with a tender offer ( although that 's not a bad idea ) . He sold his company , Electronic Data Systems ( EDS ) , to GM in 1984 , received a load of special Class E stock , kept his title of chairman of EDS ( at just $68,000 a year ? Perot does n't believe in huge salaries for executives who own a lot of stock ) , and was brought onto the GM board . He was trying to change GM from the inside . And GM needed changing . While Ford responded to the Japanese challenge by getting leaner , redesigning its cars , and stressing quality control , General Motors rested on its considerable laurels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip away , but GM kept growing ? the number of salaried employees rose by 14 percent . GM executives scoffed at Ford 's new aerodynainic designs ( " lozenges ! " ) . Their idea was to " downsize " ? to make new Chevrolets that looked like old Chevrolets but were a little smaller and lighter . GM was mired in cynicism . More and more , its cars looked alike ; the differences were in spots of chrome and in marketing . For instance , GM 's approach to the yuppie market , to young doctors and lawyers buying BMWs , was the Cimarron , which was simply a Chevrolet Cavalier with a Cadillac logo on the grille and leather seats inside , selling at a 100 percent markup . And quality ! General Motors had the worst record of any automobile manufacturer in Consumer Reports 's annual frequency-of-repair survey last April . The survey , which drew 450,000 responses , rated more than 300 models according to a Trouble Index , based on reliability in 16 different areas ? brakes , fuel system , suspension , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' 85 model cars : ( Chrysler 's total , I should note , includes cars made in Japan , such as the Dodge Colt . U.S.-made Chrysler cars did not fare so well . Of 47 models , only four percent were above average and 83 percent were below . ) Consumer Reports also listed 133 recommended used cars , in 13 price categories . These models were " relatively unlikely to be troublesome . " Of these 133 , only two GM cars ( the 1980 Buick LeSabre and Electra ) were on the recommended list . GM cars constituted two percent of the list even though GM over the last five years has sold more than 40 percent of America 's cars . By contrast , Japanese cars made up 59 percent of the list , German cars 22 percent . Ford came in at 13 percent ( a decent showing , considering Ford has a market share of 18 percent ) , and Chrysler just two percent . But GM , until very recently , had inertia on its side . The rest of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pontiacs anyway , out of habit and patriotism . Now that , too , is changing . The sales data released at the end of November were devastating . GM 's share of the U.S. market in November 1986 was only 33.8 percent , compared with 40 percent in November 1985 and over 50 percent in the mid- ' 60s . Meanwhile , Ford was up from 16.1 to 18.7 ; Toyota from 6.5 to 8.0 ; and Honda from 6.4 to 9.6 . Combine falling sales with rising costs and you have a big problem . Roger Smith knows it . A flushed , adolescent-looking man of 61 with frizzy red hair , he 's hardly the sort you would imagine as the CEO of the largest industrial company in the world . He wants to do good . He knows something is wrong at GM , and he 's tried to fix it . DeLorean said seven years ago , " General Motors is so gigantic and power-laden that the miracles of free enterprise can no longer operate , rewarding innovation and imagination and punishing lethargy and unresponsiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows it . The market is punishing lethargy . But , instead of being unresponsive , Smith has suddenly become almost too responsive . Looking for a high-tech quick fix , he bought EDS for $2.5 billion in 1984 and Hughes Aircraft , a defense electronics firm , for $5.2 billion last year . He launched the Saturn Corporation , a separate division that would build low-cost cars , using new technology and marketing techniques . He invested heavily in robotics . He set up a joint venture with Toyota to build Novas ( actually Toyota Corolla clones ) in Fremont , California . At the same time , Smith was convinced that GM had to stay big . While Ford was cutting its assembly plants from 17 to 14 , GM added five new ones . This was his " market-share " strategy . GM had to continue to dominate the U.S. market rather than look for niches . So far , the only part of the grandiose plan that has worked is the Toyota joint venture , which is building terrific little cars in a plant under Japanese management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time surviving the divorce settlement with Perot , Saturn has been scaled back by half and now looks like just another GM plant , and robotics have been expensive and not very productive . 0 A FINANCE MAN like Smith ; the failure of high T must be especially galling . Bookkeepers are used to static analysis . They want to see budgets , numbers that will hold still on the page . Then they manipulate the numbers to suit . Robotics are supposed to require a certain fixed investment , and then they 're supposed to pay off in reduced operating costs . The big question for the bookkeeper is : Does the investment today justify the savings down the road ? It was a tough call , but the bookkeeper decided to make the investment . Imagine his disgust when the investment did n't work . Recalcitrant robots ! In The Reckoning ( Morrow ) , his new book on the competition between American and Japanese automakers , David Halberstam writes about Harley Shaiken , a young MIT professor who once worked on a GM assembly line : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trendiness and wealth ? we 're not as good as they are , and we 're richer , so let 's go to robots . It was the panicky response of men who did not really know the factory . . . . It was an example of throwing money at a problem . It reminded him of the American response to Vietnam ; confronted by a clever , relentless , dedicated enemy they could not understand , the Americans had tried to win by throwing their technology at the war . Finally , with sales falling and fixed investments gobbling up cash , Smith abandoned the market-share strategy . Eleven plants are being closed ; the white-collar work force will be cut by 25 percent . GM may have to be satisfied with just a third of the market . R OGER SMITH is a tragic figure , a sweet guy with good intentions who knows something is wrong and is trying to fix it but ca n't . He is the wrong man to change General Motors . Like his four predecessors , he comes from the financial side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the product , in the cars themselves , and in motivating the employees . Besides , the system ? GM 's culture and history and huge size ? is smothering him . He says that he has had to drag middle managers " kicking and screaming " to where he wants GM to go . But there 's little evidence that they have followed ? or even that he 's really dragged them . DeLorean was right . Only an outsider can put GM on the right track today . And Smith , even with 38 years working for the system , seemed to understand . One of the reasons he bought EDS two years ago was to get the brain of Ross Perot , the ultimate outsider , to work on GM 's problem . Smith wanted GM to become more like EDS , tougher and leaner and more focused on results instead of procedures . But it did n't work . A leader without troops , Perot became frustrated . He would not behave himself . He lacked the collegial GM spirit . He was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about executives ' getting heated garages at company headquarters and chauffeur-driven cars . He said that workers and managers should eat in the same dining room and get proportional bonuses . And he did his carping publicly . In a recent interview in Ward 's Auto World , for example , Perot said : " Let 's say there is a problem with the brakes . They will send some bright , highly motivated staff person , probably a financial type , out to check on the brake problem . He talks with an accountant who talks to someone in long-range planning , and finally they form a committee to talk to some poor devil working on brakes who knows what the hell to do . " The right way to solve a brake problem , said Perot , is to put the failing parts on a desk , get a few engineers around and redesign them . The process should take weeks , not months . A director of General Motors sniping at his company in a trade publication ! And a director who did n't know anything about cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Ross Perot is one of the most ubiquitous figures in recent American history . He keeps popping up . The grandson of a French immigrant to Texas and the son of a horse trader , Perot was a great salesman , even as a kid . He managed to talk his way into an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy and , despite a mediocre academic record , was elected president of the class of 1953 . He spent four years in the Navy , then joined IBM and started breaking records selling computers . His commissions were so spectacular that the company put a ceiling on them . Above a certain level of sales in a year , Perot could n't earn a commission . In 1962 , he hit that level on January 19 . So he quit IBM and in June , with $1,000 in capital , started his own company , EDS , which set up complicated computer systems for businesses and government agencies . Instead of selling computer hardware , Perot sold methods to put it to use . EDS was housed in such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greasy spoon called " Ed 's . " The company stumbled along until 1965 , when it was hired by Texas Blue Shield to set up a computer system for handling Medicare payments , making Perot , a right-winger , into what Ramparts magazine called " America 's first welfare billionaire . " On April 22 , 1970 , at the age of 40 , Perot became famous for losing , on paper , $450 million ? " quite possibly more in actual purchasing power than any man had ever lost in a single day since the Industrial Revolution , " as John Brooks put it . The loss came in EDS stock , which suddenly and inexplicably plunged 50 points . But Perot still had a billion left . He used some of it to save the third-largest investment firm on Wall Street from going under at a critical time ; to finance a mission to Iran to spring two EDS employees from prison ( a story told in the book On Wings of Eagles ) ; to ransom ( or try to ransom ) various Americans held hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the Magna Charta and donate it to the National Archives . But , above all , Perot ? like Lee Iacocca ? was a great salesman . And his greatest sales coup was landing the world 's largest client for EDS : General Motors . The deal that Perot made in 1984 left EDS a fairly independent company . Since then , it has grown from 15,000 employees to 40,000 ; from $926 million in revenues to an estimated $5 billion for 1986 . And almost all of the growth came from work EDS was doing for GM , which now represents 74 percent of its total business . If Perot liked his side of the bargain with GM , Smith did n't like his own . Perot would n't shut up . He was making Smith 's life miserable . The great experiment had failed . At whatever cost to the company , Perot had to go . So Ross took the $743 million and left his EDS friends behind to the tender mercies of GM . ( Who was going to rescue these hostages ? ) The Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstatic " over the buyback of his stock . " He signed the agreement immediately . " But then , an hour later , Perot was saying that the deal was " morally wrong " and he was putting the money in escrow for two weeks . Morally wrong ! If it was morally wrong , why did he accept it ? Brooks , in his 1973 book The.Go-Go Years , has an explanation . " He made what he did a virtue , and a virtue of what he did , " Brooks wrote . " But was he a hypocrite ? " Brookswas referring to the initial public offering of EDS stock , which made Perot one of the half-dozen richest men in the country but which was an ill-conceived and dangerous proposition for small investors who were sucked in . But all the while , Perot was portraying himself as " a moral billionaire . " He gave $1 million to the Boy Scouts , $2 million to the Dallas public schools to finance a pilot school in a black ghetto . He refused to take tax deductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , in Perot taking the money but disdaining it . A hypocrite ? About Perot 's style , Brooks wrote : " Hypocrisy in common morals , like fraud in common law , is an offense that requires an element of ' scienter ' ? knowledge of the offender that he is committing the offense . Viewed in that light , Perot , without scienter , was innocent . " In fact , Perot and Smith were both innocent . Robert Wilson , the ace stock-picker , said in Barron 's recently , " With raiders and managements , you have scoundrels dealing with idiots . " Generally , that 's an accurate characterization . But with GM , it 's a little different . Perot is not a scoundrel , and Smith is not an idiot . They 're two men , more naive than anyone would guess , trying to fix the world 's largest company , and failing . Would Perot have made a good chairman for GM ? Probably . Should Smith and his board have put up with Perot 's obnoxious sniping ? Absolutely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GM board will soon bring in another outsider to resuscitate the company . HE ONLY alternative may be a takeover financed with junk bonds . Do n't laugh . I 've looked at the numbers . GM has 318 million shares of common stock outstanding , trading at $70 a share . A tender offer of $100 a share sounds about right . Throw in similar premiums for GM 's two other classes of stock and the total outlay for the company would come to around $39 billion . Add another billion for the investment bankers and the lawyers . Where will the $40 billion come from ? From debt ( junk bonds , if you must ) issued by my shell corporation and guaranteed by GM . Who will buy the bonds ? Anyone who would like a return of , say , 12 or 13 percent . Will current GM shareholders sell out ? Forty percent of GM 's stock is in the hands of institutions ? mutual funds , insurance companies , and pension plans ? which lack sentimental attachments to the companies whose shares they own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service the $40 billion in debt ? Out of GM 's own cash flow , which for the past three years has been running at about $10 billion annually . That 's more than enough to handle interest payments , but , if more cash is needed in the early years , I 'll sell off EDS and Hughes .. . This fantasy has gone far enough . Who wants to own GM anyway ? Let Roger Smith and his board repair the wreck of General Motors . I 'll use my $40 billion to buy something fun like Strategic Lasers Ltd. or . Erotic Pizza Group , or maybe to free some hostages .
