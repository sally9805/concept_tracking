The monkeys are the seven Vincent children : Caitlin , Sophie , Delilah , Gus Jr. , Sherman , Chicky and Minnie , the youngest . Their father , Augustus Paine Vincent , a banker and yacht-club member , has the low profile of old-line Boston . He is the weak silent type and a heavy drinker . His wife , and mother of the brood , is the former Rose Marie O'Dare , Irish Catholic and a fine choice . One suspects that the Vincent bloodline had thinned since the days of the vigorous Yankee traders and that Rose Marie brought an unaffected vitality to the clan . She makes babies as easily as some people make friends ; she revels in runny noses and dropped socks . Mothering is her natural passion . At 40 she nurses her new infant as the other children look on : " They watched her unbutton the nightgown and feel inside for the bosom . After fixing it to the baby mouth , and satisfied with it , she looked up . Caitlin and Sophie saw it  --  that wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was aimed at them and it said : There is nothing in the world compares with this . " <P> Susan Minot 's first novel is a way to understand the familial instinct at a time when young women have other demands made on their minds and bodies . The point of view is largely that of Sophie , the second daughter , who coolly focuses on incidents that span some dozen years . The book is in nine episodes that could be , with minor adjustments , independent stories . " Hiding , " the opening section , locates the emotional poles of the Vincent family . With a mischievous " hee hee hee , " Rosie crams herself and her children into a huge linen closet . The point is to play a trick on Daddy , but Daddy wo n't play . He returns home and , finding no one about , simply sits down to watch a football game on TV . Here and elsewhere , he is like an inconveniently placed piece of furniture . Yet he is not without a saving gracelessness . Drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place mat and groans , " This is so boring . " <P> Father 's melancholy and Mother 's sunny disposition determine the weather that pervades the book . It breaks over the breakfast table , at Thanksgiving dinner and during vacations at the family 's summer house in Maine . Time takes big jumps , and each episode finds the Vincents older . The girls begin dating , smoking and drinking , and the boys start sneaking off for marijuana nightcaps . Dad grows increasingly predictable ( " nothing more normal than for him to be standing in the shade at a family picnic holding a can of beer " ) , and then Mother is dead . <P> The bad news is conveyed casually . In one chapter we are gunkholing with all the Vincents in their motorboat , and in the next an indeterminate amount of time has passed , and we learn that Rosie was killed when a train hit her car . It is an effective narrative trick that Minot might have learned from John Irving , who could have got it from Evelyn Waugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touching and the macabre . Monkeys ends with the Vincents each taking a handful of Rosie 's ashes ( " rounded and porous , like little ruins " ) and <P> scattering them in the channel that flows past their summer house . The event <P> requires a double take because it ap- <P> pears at first glance that the fam- ily is posing for the Lands ' End catalog . Saying goodbye to Rosie is a scene not quickly forgotten , executed by a gifted writer whose debut can not easily be ignored .
