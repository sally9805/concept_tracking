This was the place of all places , we thought , in which superior intellectual powers could go to work . Not only would the best brains favor and protect the best art , but they were predestined to produce it , once the mystic marriage of art and technology - a favorite concept in the 1960 ' s - had been well and truly consummated . It would follow , as day follows night , that new forms of art would be generated in M.I.T. as soon as new kinds of artists became aware of its potential . Art would be at home in M.I.T. , just as the aeronautical engineer had been at home there since 1938 in the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel and the Center for Earth Studies had been at home there since 1964 in a 300-foot-high building by I. M. Pei. // After a slow start - symbolized in the domain of esthetics by the moralizing murals completed as recently as 1930 by Edwin H. Blashfield , who had graduated from M.I.T. in 1869 - M.I.T turned to the Modern movement in architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s with an openness of mind that was to turn it , over the next 30 and more years , into a living museum of the Modernist idiom . Some aspects of that idiom have worn better than others , but M.I.T. is still a stimulating place to walk around in. // Coincidentally , large-scale works of art began to be collected . This was set in motion initially by the gift from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1945 of a large painting of an oil factory by Thomas Hart Benton . It may or may not be a commentary on the times that this hymn to the new technology ( its title , " Fluid Catalytic Crackers , " relates to the process by which hydrocarbons are broken down into gasoline ) was carried out in oil over egg tempera on canvas , a technique by then quite a few hundred years old. // By the 1960 ' s , public art at M.I.T. was getting to be a pioneering activity , and by 1982 a booklet came out in which four walking tours were mapped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Smith , Louise Nevelson , Henry Moore , Alexander Calder , Ellsworth Kelly , Michael Heizer , Isaac Witkin and others . Concurrently , the courtship of art and science was conducted above all in the Center for Advanced Visual Studies that was founded in 1965 by Gyorgy Kepes. // It is nothing against M.I.T. that some of these activities have already dated . Trial and error are as fundamental to art as they are to science . The interest of the Albert and Vera List Visual Arts Center lies in the fact that , although it epitomizes M.I.T. ' s ambition to get the arts to come together , it is devoted primarily to works of art in which technology has played no part . We are not obliged , in other words , to stand and stare at a lot of goofy machines and wait for something significant to come of it . Each of the works from the List collection that make up the inaugural show was made by one person , with one pair of hands , working alone . Even Robert Rauschenberg , who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his generosity to the organization known as Experiments in Art and Technology , is represented by an easel painting called " Summer Rental " ( 1960 ) that neither hums , talks , moves , nor waits for us to activate it. // Though dominated by Jasper Johns ' s " Diver " ( 1962 ) , one of the most complex and enigmatic images of its date , the inaugural exhibition gives equal time to painting and sculpture . Arp , Giacometti , Dubuffet and Max Ernst are there , alongside a monumental sculpture in wood and creosote by Robert Grosvenor and a no less monumental sculpture by James Surles called " I Saw a Man With Shovels in His Hands Scooping Fire . " Differences of age , date , scale and medium , though often extreme , are never gratuitous . Quality , not polemic , dictates them. // Particularly arresting , for this visitor , was something that I had often wished to see but never thought would come about . This is the juxtaposition of Giacometti ' s celebrated " Citysquare " of 1950 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shapiro is in a quiet way the animating force of the show . ) When the Giacometti was first shown in Paris , it rhymed to perfection with the existential anguish that seemed fundamental to life in Europe just after the end of World War II . Crossing and recrossing a macadamized void , Giacometti ' s intent , loping figures , each rapt in his own isolation , were almost too much to bear . This was - or so it seemed then - an image that was one of a kind , and inimitable. // But then Joel Shapiro came along and brought a new density and impregnability to that American staple , the plain little house that sat firm and straight in an empty space . It wasn ' t " architecture , " but it was the barn , the homestead and the ark inside which Americans for several hundred years had battened down the hatches and waited for better times . Shapiro ' s houses generally came in isolation , and many of them were no bigger than a small-sized shoe . But in the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they sat lopsidedly on a rectangular base that could have stretched on and on into infinity . Once again , there was no " architecture , " any more than there was town planning in the asymmetrical manner of their placing . But somehow those houses seemed as fundamental to the late 1970 ' s in this country as the Giacometti had seemed to the Paris of 1950 . Nor were they dwarfed , as art. // This is an instance of the ways in which the M.I.T. student is led to consider the range , the power and the possible echoes of art . M.I.T. is a teaching institution , and Kathy Halbreich , who is director of exhibitions at the Center and has already a long list of provocative exhibitions behind her , is someone who believes that young people need to have bridges built for them , and a frame of reference set . The point of the Center is not to make exhibitions that will impress people from out of town . It is to give the students a language in which to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensations of inadequacy - by fear of feeling , in a word. // This is not to say that the romance of art and technology has been erased from this department of M.I.T. Performance art , of a kind that often calls for elaborate technological equipment , is an integral part of the Center ' s activity . In March , Stuart Sherman , movie maker , sculptor and performance artist , worked on a piece that aimed to be , in effect , a brief condensation of the theater of Anton Chekhov . In April , Thomas Kovachevich , doctor , sculptor and performance artist , wrought strange marvels with paper membranes that were activated by environmental conditions . Others will follow , in monthly rotation. // As for the contributions of Kenneth Noland and Scott Burton to the building , they do not enter into rivalry with Pei &; Partners , as might have been the case . Each one of them is , in fact , a lesson in unselfishness of a kind not often met with when artists and architects are called upon to collaborate with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to animate surfaces that might otherwise have seemed short on incident . Burton confined himself to details of railing , staircase and public seating , and he has done it in ways so subtle that they may well be invisible to the casual visitor . Fleischner ' s job is to articulate the two-and-half-acre transitional area between the Pei building and its neighbor ( for which Aldo Giurgola was responsible ) . Other artists - Dan Flavin , James Turrell and Alan Shields - were invited to participate but withdrew at a comparatively early stage in the discussions. // As a university museum - for that is , in effect , its function - the List Visual Center is likely to take a high place , thanks to the distinction of the building , the inspirational quality of those after whom it is named , and the radical energies of its director of exhibitions . If it can keep up its present momentum , M.I.T. will have the kind of glamour , in the visual arts , that it had 20 years ago. //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
