Vector Graphic finds a niche <P> Six years ago , the fondest hope of Carole Ely and Lore Harp was to escape the bored-housewives trap and do something really bold like , say , opening a travel agency . When Lore 's husband Bob , a scientist at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu , Calif. , suggested that they think big and take a plunge into computers instead , they responded with what amounted to uncomprehending stares . Neither knew the first thing about the exotic world of computers . <P> Today the two women are acknowledged leaders in the fast-tracking field of microcomputers , and their six-year-old company , Vector Graphic Inc. , stands out as one of the industry 's wilder success stories . By offering a line of desktop computers more powerful than most personal computers but less costly than the larger machines that are usually sold to small businesses , the company has carved out a market niche largely overlooked by other competitors . Sales have zoomed from $404,000 in 1977 to $25 million last year , and more than 12,000 Vector Graphic systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $4,000 to $25,000 . <P> <P> Harp and Ely 's education in computers actually began when Bob Harp , a onetime engineer at the California Institute of Technology and an inveterate high-tech tinkerer on weekends , proposed that the two try to market a memory board , which stores information , that he had designed in his spare time . With $6,000 they bought inventory and printing materials and started assembling the boards in the Harp home . Styrofoam packing materials were stored in a downstairs shower ; the dining room became a testing area . <P> Success led the group into an even bolder venture : assembling entire desktop computers . Today that work takes place in 120,000 sq . ft. of leased office and manufacturing space in Thousand Oaks , Calif. , and involves 400 people who design , assemble and sell eight microcomputer models . All involved with the startup have become millionaires : together the founding trio owns more than half of Vector Graphic stock , worth around $29 million at last week 's over-the-counter close of $9.75 a share . <P> The group has avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start it relied on the advice of accountants and demanded payment from customers in cash . Rather than marketing its wares through catalogues and mail-order houses , the firm courted well-established dealers like Computerland , a coast-to-coast retailing network for personal and small-business computers . To assure reliable servicing , Vector worked out a deal with TRW , a Cleveland-based aerospace and electronics conglomerate . <P> Though the feisty young company so far shows no signs of stumbling , corporate success has claimed two casualties : the Harp and Ely marriages . Says Bob of his separation from Lore last year : " It was an ego conflict . She wanted to do things one way ; I wanted to do them another . " Says Carole Ely : " I was running away from a marriage into a company . "
