As a cartoonist , Garry Trudeau has earned a reputation for throwing punches as often as punch lines . The creator of Doonesbury once led readers on a comic tour through Ronald Reagan 's brain and lanced House Speaker Tip O'Neill for protecting Congressmen who were chummy with South Korean lobbyists . Last month a sequence ridiculing the antiabortion documentary The Silent Scream so worried the Universal Press Syndicate , Doonesbury 's distributor , that the artist agreed to withdraw it . Trudeau was back in the headlines ( and his strip briefly out of several papers ) last week for giving a black eye to Ol ' Blue Eyes himself , Frank Sinatra . <P> In a six-day series , Trudeau depicted Sinatra as a vulgar-mouthed pal of mobsters , undeserving of the Medal of Freedom recently given him by Reagan . The most debated strip quoted a citation that accompanied an honorary degree Sinatra received last month from New Jersey 's Stevens Institute of Technology . The final panel carried a mid-1960s photo of Sinatra with Aniello Dellacroce , who was described as an " alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gambino Family Member Charley Calise . " <P> Of the 835 newspapers that carry the strip , about half a dozen , including the Los Angeles Times , canceled the Sinatra series , despite assurances that Universal 's libel lawyers had reviewed the cartoons . A dozen other papers , among them Long Island 's Newsday , refused to run the Dellacroce installment on the grounds that the caption failed to point out that Dellacroce had been acquitted of the 1974 killing . Editors at the New York Daily News , the San Francisco Chronicle , the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Chicago Tribune blue- penciled mention of the Calise murder . The Daily News , for example , simply called Dellacroce " underboss of Gambino family , " a designation the paper based on past testimony by federal prosecutors . <P> Some editors who dropped or altered the strip expressed concern about libeling Sinatra , but most felt the issue was one of fairness , not of law . Said Daily News Managing Editor James Willse : " If you say someone is charged with a crime in the past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not complete reporting . " Other editors viewed the episode as a tempest in an inkpot . " This does n't seem to be one of the greatest issues of our time , " said Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee , whose paper ran the series with a separate story explaining Dellacroce 's acquittal ( and his recent indictment on racketeering charges ) . Many papers also printed Sinatra 's response criticizing Trudeau for " his attempts at humor without regard to fairness or decency . " <P> Though some Doonesbury fans might view Trudeau 's treatment of Sinatra as heavy-handed , friends of the cartoonist speculate that the attack reflects a delib erate change of tone . When Trudeau returned from a 21-month sabbatical last September , his favorite target , Reagan , was heading for a thunderous re- election . Instead of poking fun directly at the President for four more years , Trudeau is taking a harsher satirical stance against issues and people close to Reagan . Trudeau , as always , declines comment . " I have n't been able to sit still for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't think I 'm inclined to start again over this particular issue . "
