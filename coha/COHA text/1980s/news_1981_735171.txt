txt ' IT WAS A hot Aug. 1 , and the Bears were about to complete an intrasquad scrimmage , As the seconds and the Small crowd at Lake Forest . High School dwindled , the . third-string offense had the ball near the goal line . There was time for one , maybe two plays , before the players could get on a bus , take a shower and enjoy A rare summer afternoon off . Alan Page was screaming at the officials , " The ball goes on this side of the yard marker , not the other " side , " Page yelled , The officials looked stunned . If you are going to do something , do it right . If there Is a rule , follow it . If it is your job , take it seriously . " If Alan comes to a stop sign on a country road in the middle of the night with nobody around , he comes to a ; completestop , said Diane Sims Page , his wife , ? ? ALAN PAGE will play Ms 218th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ' Bears play the Denver ' Broncos , who can wrap up . the ? ? AFC West Division titlemith victury . The.Bears can wrap up M3-10 season , hart less disappointing than 5-11 ? But if you , think it will e less important to Page than it is to ' Denvert then the point already has been missed ; there is no need for Page to block it . ? ' a have , yet to see him play a game that he did n't go 101 ) percent , " said Neill Armstrong , who has had a part in ' coaching Page'for 13 of his 15 pro years . Page has blocked 28 kicks in his career , typiehl of the , big plays that helped him raise his position of defensive tackle to a new.plateau in the sport . Until , Page , the book said ' defensive tackles were bulky run-stoppds , supporting actors for the swift ends and blitzing linebackers . " I guess I never read the book , " Page said . HE WROTE his own , No rule said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of Notre Dame and finishes Sunday at 220 . Minnesota 's Bud . Grant lost ' interest in him by the , pound , which only made the game ' more challenging to Page . " Most of the ' time at Minnesota , . he was 245,250 , " said Arthstrong . " I never saw anybody any quicker . or any better . ' , , ' The big , plays used to occur more , often . In 1971 , Page was named the league 's Most Valuable Player , the only defensive player so honored , " There was a game ' against Detroit ' that was astounding , " said Bill , ' the Bears ' assistant ' general manager who worked for the Vikings ' at'the time . " It was one guy intimidating a  --  whole offenCe . " ONE SEQUENCE of plays went like this : On seCond . and ' 10 at ' the Detroit 28 , . Page was penalfzecifor , a personal foul . ' k - 10- at the 45 , . Page was penalfied for // From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passer . First and 10 at the Minnesota 40 , Page sacked Greg Landry for 9 yards . Second and 19 , Carl Eller jumped offsides . Second and 14 , Page and Gary Larsen chased Landry , who fell for a loss of 11 . ' Detroit was called for holding . Second and 40 at the Detroit 10 , Page tackled Altie Taylor for a 9-yard loss . ' Third and 44 at the 26 , Page tackled Landry after a gain of 2 . , Fourth and 42 at the 28 , Page deflected Herman Weaver 's punt . Ball dead at the 50 . Later in the game , Page blocked a punt for a safety . do n't know whether that year was any different from any other year , " said Page . REACHING THE AGE of ' 36 and a little-publicized groin injury this year have made retirement a good idea . They talk about running at him , but that is nothing new . It was always *better than letting him chase . He never wore arm pads because he never planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slowed him ' down . " He ran around a lot of blocks , " said Armstrong . No rules said he could n't . Now rules allow offensive linemen more leeway to hold and push . They are trying to make men like Page obsolete . Page says that only makes it more challenging . ? " When they changed the rules , you went berserk , ' , Diane reminded him . AS AN ICONOCLAST on and off the field , rules would not seem to appeal so much to Page . On the contrary , he became a lawyer to help satisfy his sense of order . " I want to change rules , " he said . " It is the perfect profession for him , " said Diane . His attraction to football includes a salary of $240,000 . It makes him the highest-paid defensive lineman in the ' game , but not the quietest . " He rebelled against the concept of what a football player should be like , " said . At his first rookie night in Minnesota , veterans wanted Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They switched their demand to beer . He said no . They settled for warm Coke . He said no . They told him to drink or walk . " He left , " said Diane . " To me that characterizes Alan Page . " THE vLAST TIME he followed the crowd as as a kid In Canton , Ohio , where football teams enjoy the same priority among Idda that is reserved In other places for Inner-city gangs . Page played no other sport . basically could n't walk and chew gum , " said Page . " My brother played , so I did . " Once the decision was made , there was only one way to play . If you take on a task , do it the best you can , " he said . He never became a fan . There are moments , he says , when the sacks , . the ' blocks , the fumble recoveries are satisfying . On . the whole , he , would rather hi . jogging , and the thrill , of football is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is secondary to the striving , " said Page . " There are special moments . To be a part of a team that Is not , supposed to win and everybOdy plays well and wins . There 's something good about that . " AT THE RISK of being hypocritical , he is outspoken against violence . " It bothers me that I 'm a part of it , I have to turn my back on It , " he said . When he broke New Orleans ' quarterback Archie Manning 's nose last year , he apologized " about three times , " Manning said . Although Page is puzzled by the casual approach some players take toward their livglihood , he is bothered more by the elevated place football has in the nation 's consciousness . ' " It 's just entertainment . It 's a football game . We ' go out and play 16 ' times a year and there 's not much more to it , " he said . Of course , the exaggerated importance does n't bother him enough to play for fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe a little disappointing , " he said . " I had five years ' experience and 10 years of the same year over again . " He admits law could eventually produce the same rut if he allows it to . Already he has found he can not count on the immediacy of results that fobtball provides . He spent hours preparing for a case last offseason only to find it settled . " I know it was best for the client , but I was disappointed to have all that , preparation go down the drain , " he said . " At least . in football , after practicing all week , you do n't show up Sunday morning in the locker room only to find that the coach and the other team have cut a deal . " HE HAS NEVER missed a game and he says he wo n't miss the sport . If a transition is required , he will get it during this offseason when he is active in NFL collective bargaining talks . And he wo n't completely walk away from sports ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When named by the Jaycees last year as one of America 's ? 10 Outstanding Young Men , Page vowed to work toward equality of the races and sexes . Bears ' general manager Jim Finks raised his eyebrows when he heard that , because he never has seen Page fail . " I do n't want to leave the impression I hated everything about football , " said Page . " One thing I will miss is all the people and experiences . I 've had a lot of fascinating and interesting life experiences on and off the field ; on practice fields and game fields , In locker rooms , buses and airplanes . I 've had some wild experiences , all of which have been a little slice of life that a lot of people do n't get to see . " On the other hand , a lei of people have had experiences in ' their lives I wo n't get to see either . And so it 's been fascinating and more than a little bit interesting and more than a little bit fun , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't all that important anyway . "
