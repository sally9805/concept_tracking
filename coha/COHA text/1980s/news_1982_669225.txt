Each camp is making rosy predictions for its side . But in recent interviews , Democratic officials are more ebullient about their future . ' ' The mood is that we ' re going to clean their clocks , ' ' says Rep. Tony Coelho ( D ) of California , who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee . ' ' We ' re doing extremely well because the economy is so bad. ' ' // Not long ago Republicans were harboring dreams of sweeping into power in the House , just as they had taken over the Senate in 1980 . Many have scaled back their hopes , but not Rep. Guy Vander Jagt , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee . ' ' The Republicans definitely could take over the House , ' ' says the Michigan congressman , who is the Republican superstar of fund-raising. // The key is to ' ' pin the tail on the donkey , ' ' says Mr. Vander Jagt , and ' ' make it clear that the Democrats made this ( economic ) mess . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making that point. // Although the economy will clearly dominate , this year ' s congressional campaigns consist of more than assessing blame for the nation ' s problems . Money , organization , even high technology , plus the choice of candidates will make or break campaigns . And in the first three of these departments , the Republicans are acknowledged as superior. // When this reporter visited the Republican congressional campaign headquarters , the hallways were stacked high with newly arrived computer terminals  --  evidence of the Republican riches and high-tech approach to politics . This week the Democratic committee was expecting delivery of two computer terminals. // Long known as the party of corporate America , the GOP takes a decidely businesslike approach to campaigning. // ' ' A campaign is an enterprise where the sale is on for one day , and what a candidate is trying to do is get a 51 percent share of the market , ' ' says Nancy Sinnott , executive director of the GOP campaign committee. // So the Republicans have systematically gone about trying to capture that market share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year the GOP congressional campaign committee expects to raise $37 million , while the Democrats have hopes for raising only $8 million to give to their candidates. // Despite their big-money image , the Republicans have built their huge war chest on contributions that average $20 each . Most of the credit goes to Mr. Vander Jagt , who established a computerized fund-raising drive by mail . ' ' We have truly become the party of the little giver , ' ' says Vander Jagt , whose leadership boosted the campaign committee ' s fund-raising from $900 , 000 in 1974 to its current $30-million-plus level. // Democrats , meanwhile , depend heavily on a few generous benefactors . Congressman Coelho is beginning to change that by taking pages out of the Vander Jagt book . The Democrats now have their own fund-raising letter drives . But the funds will be no help in the 1982 elections because all money raised by the mailings so far is plowed back into more fund-raising. // The Republican advantage goes even further since the party has carefully courted ' ' political action committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to selected candidates . A Republican road show of officials is now visiting more than a dozen cities to make contact with local PACs . Democrats have responded with a PAC forum in Washington for their candidates , but they are still playing catch-up. // Beyond the money advantage , the Republicans are also far ahead in systematic recruitment and training of candidates , in digging up negative information about their opponents , and in media advertising . Nine Republican field directors scattered throughout the states scout out candidates for the House . Once a candidate decides to run , he or she can then attend a training workshop , courtesy of the Republican campaign committee , for lessons in everything from political issues to looking good on TV . And Republican candidates can send their campaign directors to a six-day training session in Arlington. // The Democrats are beginning to offer some training , but it ' s only in the early stages . Their recruiting staff consists of one director and two assistants manning telephones in Washington. // Both parties now store information in computers on their opponents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vander Jagt says that his committee ' s ' ' extensive opposition research program ' ' includes keeping voting records and financial reports on Democrats. // ' ' Many of their members got by voting liberal here and talking conservative back home , ' ' says Vander Jagt . With the computer , a Republican challenger can have plenty of ammunition. // For the first time , Republican candidates will have computers at their campaign headquarters that can tie into the Washington campaign committee . ' ' I think this is an exciting new breakthrough in political campaigning , ' ' says Vander Jagt. // Democrat Coelho has wasted little time in following the lead . He already has obtained computerized information , such as voting records , on Republicans . ' ' As we score a few points , the Republicans realize we are there , ' ' he says . ' ' They ' re watching us all over the place. ' ' // Coelho is particularly pleased that his committee ' s records turned up proof that Vice-President George Bush had once referred to Reaganomics as ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 challenged anyone to offer proof that he had used that term , and within hours the Democratic congressional campaign had pulled out a Pittsburgh newspaper clipping with the evidence and sent out a press release. // The Democrats will not be able to compete with the Republicans in one field , however , and that is national media advertisements . The Democrats don ' t have the money . The Republicans scored big with their ' ' Vote Republican for a change ' ' theme in 1980 . Now the Republicans are working on a new slogan , ' ' something with ' new , ' ' change , ' or ' fresh , ' ' ' he says. // Although these aids may boost the Republicans , they do not guarantee victory . Republicans have had a number of these advantages for years without winning big gains in Congress . More important will be the quality of candidates . Both parties are claiming superiority there. // Top candidates are sensing a Democratic victory this year , says Coelho , and signing up to run . ' ' I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing people to run , ' ' he says. // Republican Vander Jagt counters , ' ' We have far and away the best crop of candidates that we ' ve ever fielded . ' ' He lists such media stars as a former all-American football player , an astronaut , and a former prisoner of war in Vietnam as ' ' sure winners . ' ' He says he worries more about losing GOP incumbents than losing challenger races. // Meanwhile , both parties are taking aim at each other ' s leaders . ' ' We have candidates we ' ve been drooling over , ' ' allows Vander Jagt . One is a California sheriff that the GOP is lining up against Tony Coelho. // The Democrats hope to keep Vander Jagt busy ( and off the fund-raising circuit ) with an opponent in his district , and two Democrats are running write-in campaigns in the Illinois district of House Republican leader Robert H. Michel. // The voters will make the final determination about who has the best candidates , and one unknown factor is exactly which districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nationwide redistricting for Congress is far from complete . The new districts , which must comply with the 1980 census figures , remain unsettled in about half the states. // Since most of the population shifts are from the Democratic urban North to more surburban areas in Florida and the West , the Republicans expect to gain seats in redistricting . But the gain may not be as big as some Republicans had hoped , largely because of maneuvering in Democratic-controlled statehouses. // Vander Jagt says he expects a net ' ' bonus ' ' of 10 to 12 GOP seats from redistricting . Eugene Eidenberg , executive director of the National Democratic Committee , has predicted that neither party will gain . ' ' All that Republican money , those computers , and maps , ' ' did not help them in redistricting , says Mr. Eidenberg . ' ' When it comes down to it , it ' s good , fair , tough politics. ' ' // Vander Jagt describes redistricting differently - as the ' ' crassest ' ' form of politics . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor will political high technology assure a victory next November , but the Republicans are convinced it won ' t hurt. // //
