Israel assesses the damage of the fighting-and the cease-fire <P> " We shall not hold our fire indefinitely . If the terrorists keep on shooting , we shall not stand idly by . " So declared Prime Minister Menachem Begin as he tried to reassure a worried Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of the Knesset that Israel 's security had not been unduly compromised by the ceasefire with the Palestinians . Begin 's gruff tone-and the contentious nature of the meeting-reflected Israel 's mood last week as it counted the costs , military and political , of the 14 days of fighting and the uneasy peace that followed . <P> The cease-fire was holding-barely-although there was a hot debate over what it entailed . After a Syrian MiG was shot down by Israeli planes over Lebanon , for example , the question arose whether Israel had the right , under the agreement , to continue its reconnaissance flights over the country . The Palestine Liberation Organization said no ; the Israelis said yes , and the U.S. backed them up . <P> Leaders of the P.L.O . felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations for the ceasefire by dealing , however indirectly , with both the U.S. and Israel . Neither country has recognized the P.L.O . as officially representing the Palestinians . The P.L.O . was also confident that the Israelis had suffered a serious propaganda defeat as a result of their bombing raid on Beirut , in which some 300 Lebanese and Palestinians , most of them civilians , were killed and another 800 wounded . <P> The Beirut raid had indeed shocked the world , as the Israelis were worriedly acknowledging . Opposition Leader Shimon Peres flatly called it " a mistake . " On the other hand , the Israeli raids on Lebanon called attention to the enormous arms buildup of the P.L.O . over the past six months . The new arms , paid for mainly by Libya , Iraq and Saudi Arabia , include Soviet-made 122-mm howitzers and 130-mm field guns . These weapons have not yet turned the Palestinians into a serious threat to the Israeli armed forces , but they have made it difficult for the Israelis to knock out P.L.O . concentrations with anything short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem on his mind last week : forming a government . He was having a far harder time than expected in bargaining with his three potential partners , all small and conservative religious parties , to get the support he needed . Begin brought up the difficulty in an unusual setting in Tel Aviv . Wearing a black skullcap and sweating under the bright lights , he stood before an audience of the National Bible Quiz , a sort of Israeli College Bowl for scholars of the Old Testament . After telling the group how hard he had been working to try to put a new government together , the Prime Minister declared : " But the Bible is so rejuvenating , I feel quite young and strong . " In fact , he joked , " you could say I feel fit enough to go through another election . " In all likelihood , however , he will still be able to form a new government by Aug. 4 , the deadline he had originally set for himself . He could nevertheless be forced to take an additional 21 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yitzhak Navon .
