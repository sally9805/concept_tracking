Across the Atlantic for $149 <P> The scene on an observation deck at Newark International Airport last Thursday night was steeped in irony . Newark-based People Express , the cost-conscious , no-free-food airline that is sometimes called the McDonald 's of the skies , was throwing a bash for employees , passengers and anyone else who dropped by . Champagne flowed and tables were covered with such treats as candied kiwi fruit , Brie and salmon mousse . <P> The cheapskate airline had reason to be generous . The British government earlier that day had given People Express the final go-ahead to start cut-rate transatlantic service , and the passengers at the party were about to board a Boeing 747 for the inaugural flight to London . The one-way price : $149 , or little more than half the lowest regular coach fare of $275 . <P> " It 's unbelievable , " said People Express President Donald Burr , 41 , who at the last minute decided to take the maiden flight . " We 've been flying for only two years , and we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His fellow passengers were equally ecstatic . Said Robin Raines , 28 , an aspiring actress from New York City : " You ca n't beat this price . For once , I 'm jet-setting . " People plans to fly five 747 round trips between Newark and London weekly . The airline already has more than 35,000 requests for reservations . <P> When it first went into the air two years ago , People Express had only three planes serving four cities : Newark , Columbus , Buffalo and Norfolk . Now , in addition to its new London flights , People has 22 aircraft flying to 19 U.S. cities stretching from Portland , Me. , to West Palm Beach , Fla . Its quick success has come from cutting frills and slashing standard fares , often by more than half . Like its domestic flights , People 's trips to London will offer few free amenities . Passengers will have to pay $6 extra for a food basket that might contain a tuna sandwich , an apple , potato salad and a brownie .

Others include New York Air , Midway Airlines in Chicago and Muse Air in Dallas . These newcomers have sparked a string of fare wars that along with the recession have crippled the entire industry . People is one of the few carriers that has been able to keep costs low enough to turn a profit . The airline earned $2.1 million in the first quarter , while the eleven largest carriers suffered a combined operating loss of $619 million . <P> One reason for the difference is that People 's work force is lean and productive . The airline has only 52 employees per plane ; many other airlines have twice that number . Staff members are willing to switch from job to job , helping out where needed rather than enforcing strict work rules .
