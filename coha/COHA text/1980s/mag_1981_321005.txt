For Master Planner James Rouse , urban life is a festival <P> The people are the city . - Shakespeare , Coriolanus <P> They come in every size , costume , complexion , class and age , an ever renewing multitude , lured to ocean 's edge as inexorably as water sprites . From early morning until well past midnight , natives and tourists by the thousands turn Baltimore 's Inner Harbor into a continuous celebration : milling on the promenades , perching on the bulkheads , dangling feet in the drink , flirting on the benches , lounging in the outdoor cafs , ogling , jogging , strolling , munching , sipping , savoring the sounds and sweet airs . In their midst , jugglers hurl batons , mimes mime , clowns pratfall and dancers soar . At one time or another , the sounds of jazz , Mozart , marching bands , rock , Rodgers , Bach , bagpipes and bouzouki fill the air . The air is filled , too , with the fragrances of fresh-baked bread , cheeses , chocolate , roasting coffee beans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soul food , souvlaki , spices and herbs . <P> All this wafts like a siren song from the twin glass and green-roofed shopping pavilions that form the year-old Harborplace : two-story , block-long , translucent pleasure domes where visitors can be seen from outside swarming in rhythmic schools like the angelfish at the nearby National Aquarium in Baltimore , a dazzling , $21.3 million piscine habitat that was formally opened Aug. 8 ( see box ) . <P> Fifteen years ago , the 3.2-acre site of Harborplace was part of a 250-acre wasteland of rotting wharves , markets , warehouses and railroad yards , the worst of Baltimore 's then decrepit downtown . Its transformation into the commercial and social centerpiece of the Inner Harbor and the energizing jolt it has sent through the entire city are the result of $20 million worth of construction , plus the ideas and energy of an affable Marylander named James Wilson Rouse . <P> Rouse , 67 , considers himself a developer , but is best described as an urban visionary . Over the past five years , in such innovative ventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Market Street East and Santa Monica <P> Place , a covered shopping mall in the heart of the California coastal city , he has shown a unique and uncanny ability to blend commerce and showmanship into a magnetizing force in the inner city . In the process , he has also sought to reshape current-day thinking about the functions and rewards of city life . The Rouse philosophy revolves not so much around real estate as around meeting the needs and desires of people-which , to say the least , seemed bizarre to most mortgage bankers when he was starting out . He has more than proved his point , and nowhere more spectacularly than in Baltimore . <P> Harborplace , in its first year of operation ending last month , attracted more visitors ( 18 million ) than Disney World , earned $42 million , created 2,300 jobs and returned to the city more than $1.1 million in taxes . More important , it has lived up to Master Planner Rouse 's criterion of the inner city as " a warm and human place , with diversity of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall Marketplace , it has helped restore a sense of community and vitality to a divided , decaying , once apathetic older city .
