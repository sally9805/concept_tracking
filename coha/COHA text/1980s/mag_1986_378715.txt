Long lines of holiday travelers pushing heavily laden baggage carts were waiting in the main departure lounge of Rome 's Leonardo da Vinci Airport . Hardly anyone paid much attention to four dark-complexioned young men who mingled with the crowd . One wore an expensive gray suit and camel 's hair topcoat . Two were in blue jeans and jackets , and had pulled scarves partly over their faces . The fourth sported a green beret . They were not traveling light : they carried 13 hand grenades and four AK-47 automatic rifles . <P> At 9:03 a.m. , one of the men threw a grenade toward a nearby espresso bar and hamburger counter , where General Donato Miranda Acosta , the military attach at the Mexican embassy in Rome , was sipping coffee with his secretary , Genoveva Jaime Cisneros , who was there to see him and his family off on a vacation trip to Frankfurt . Miranda Acosta and Cisneros were probably the first to be killed . Then the attackers raked the 820-ft. - long terminal with bullets , hitting people waiting for an E1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counters . The men jumped up and down in a frenzy , screaming as they fired , and security guards shot back . " People were falling all over the place , " recalled Anna Girometta , who operates a gift shop near the coffee bar . " It seemed to go on forever . " Five minutes later , the carnage was over . The toll : 15 people dead , including three of the terrorists , and 74 wounded . <P> At about the time that the shooting stopped at Leonardo da Vinci , three men in dirty pants and combat jackets ran up the steps to the second-floor departure area at Vienna 's Schwechat Airport . They opened fire with AK-47s . Passengers waiting to check in for E1 A1 Flight 364 to Tel Aviv threw themselves on the floor or leaped over ticket counters in panic . Police and E1 A1 security guards returned the fire , but the terrorists managed to get within 30 ft. of the counter . They rolled three hand grenades across the floor like bowling balls toward their victims . <P> Eckehard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some vacation study in Israel , died of multiple wounds under a brightly lit Christmas tree near the E1 A1 counter . " Suddenly there was this terrible noise , not single shots but real explosions , " said a Viennese man who jumped behind a counter . " Three or four meters to my left , three people had fallen to the ground . There was a small child , all bloodied , its mother , who was also wounded , and a man who lay bleeding and seemed dead . To my right , another man had fallen and did not budge anymore . " <P> Within two minutes after the shooting began , the gunmen escaped down a flight of stairs and headed for an employee garage , where one of them pulled a knife on an airport official and commandeered his Mercedes-Benz . In a running gun battle with police , the terrorists tossed a grenade at a pursuing patrol car ( it missed ) , and police bullets flattened a tire and pierced the gas tank of the Mercedes . Just two miles from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three dead , including one of the terrorists , and 47 wounded .
