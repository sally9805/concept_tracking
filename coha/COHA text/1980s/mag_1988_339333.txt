The jeeps that arrived at army headquarters in Port-au-Prince last week were greeted by incredulous stares . Seated handcuffed and rigid inside were more than 30 commanders who had been ousted by junior officers in barracks revolts around the country . Crowds in the bloodstained Haitian capital cheered as the manacled prisoners were set down before the two-story headquarters building , which quickly became known as the " parking " because of all the senior military men who were being " parked " there . Some slept on cots inside the building while waiting to be discharged . <P> The extraordinary purge reflected the discontent that has seethed within the lower echelons of the armed forces since the 1986 ouster of dictator Jean- Claude ( " Baby Doc " ) Duvalier . Two weeks ago , the unrest exploded when noncommissioned officers toppled Lieut . General Henri Namphy as Haiti 's leader and installed Lieut . General Prosper Avril as President . The coup grew out of grievances that ranged from bad food to military tolerance of the murder of civilians by thugs and members of the Tonton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28-year dynasty begun by Duvalier 's father Francois ( " Papa Doc " ) Duvalier . <P> Troops who earned just $100 a month bitterly resented having to bribe senior officers up to $300 for a promotion . Others complained of secondhand shoes and uniforms . At the same time , junior officers were cut out of the lucrative drug profits that commanders received from cocaine dealers , who in recent years have made Haiti a key transshipment point between South America and the U.S. <P> After concluding that conditions would not improve under Namphy , a group of young officers led by Sergeant Joseph Hebreux , a 27-year-old medic in the Presidential Guard , began plotting to remove him . Namphy learned of the coup through a defector and planned to arrest about 75 guardsmen . But on Saturday , Sept. 17 , two tanks and some 650 troops surrounded the National Palace . Desperate , Namphy called for help from Colonel Jean-Claude Paul , who commands Haiti 's main military barracks . Paul hurried to the scene but without mustering his men . When Namphy finally grabbed a megaphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they responded with M-60 machine-gun fire . Namphy then surrendered and was flown to exile in the Dominican Republic , where he remains holed up in a heavily guarded hotel suite . <P> Triumphant junior officers wanted to name Hebreux the new President of Haiti , but the young medic reportedly became agitated and declared that he was not prepared for the post . Only then was Avril , 51 , a senior Presidential Guardsman and a longtime associate of the Duvaliers who had nonetheless helped oust Baby Doc , selected to lead the country . <P> But when Avril stood before his new civilian Cabinet in the National Palace last Monday , Hebreux was at his left , a manila envelope in one hand , an Uzi submachine gun on his shoulder . And when Avril appeared before Presidential Guard troops the following day , Hebreux handed him a statement to read .
