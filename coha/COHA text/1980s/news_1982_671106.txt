" You know all those dire things I said about the economy in the campaign ? " said Governor Kean . " Well , it turns out they ' re true . " " New Jersey , " said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt , the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics , " is very much in the heart of the recession . " The state ' s unemployment rate , according to the bureau , stood at 9. 2 percent in May , unchanged from April . By comparison , the rate was 8. 1 percent for New York State in May and 9. 5 percent nationally. // Dr. William C. Freund , chief economist for the New York Stock Exchange and a member of New Jersey ' s Economic Policy Council , sees it differently . " The state is doing remarkably well , " he said in a recent interview . " The impact of the recession has been extremely mild. " // Newark clearly bears out the grimmer view . There are a few new office towers , but they are surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Streets are in disrepair , shops and factories are shuttered , and the crime rate is one of the highest of any city in the nation . Newark is a textbook example of the ills of the urban Northeast ; Trenton , Elizabeth and Camden are little different. // But , not 50 miles from Newark , in the woodsy Somerset Hills , construction crews are putting up an enormous residential and commercial complex that one day will employ and house 9 , 000 people . Called The Hills , the development will offer attached town houses for $80 , 000 and more , private homes averaging $350 , 000 , and a shopping center and a luxury hotel . The activity belies the fact that the nation is in its worst housing slump since the 1930 ' s. // The Hills is at the center of a part of New Jersey that is booming . On every side , corporate headquarters and research parks are rising out of the woods and hollows where cattle once grazed and a privileged few rode to hounds. // The American Telephone and Telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group and Exxon are just a few of the companies that have or are about to put up office buildings or clusters of them in the area , which extends outward from the intersection of Routes 78 and 287 in Somerset . There are now 13 corporate offices in the region. // Shopping centers are coming along to serve all these people , and real-estate specialists predict that the first real drop in interest rates will bring about a boom in home building in the area. // This is the second of the two New Jersey economies . And it proves - if anyone is still in doubt - that New Jersey ' s industrial image , with belching smokestacks and bustling factories , has been inaccurate for some time. // New Jersey , one of the earliest states in the nation to become industrialized , actually has been losing heavy manufacturing for a longer time than most other Northeastern states . According to Dr. George Sternlieb , director of Rutgers University ' s Center for Urban Policy Research , the state ' s industrial decline has been under way since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , once its economic lifeblood , began to drift to the South long before World War I. // In recent years , the departing companies have included Ford in Mahwah and General Motors in Bloomfield , both assembly plants ; Alcoa in Edison ; American Can in Hillside ; Phelps Dodge in South Brunswick ; Westinghouse in Jersey City , and Owens-Illinois in Moonachie. // The state had 900 , 000 manufacturing jobs in 1969 and 700 , 000 in 1975 . It now claims to have about 580 , 000 . Manufacturing jobs have dropped from 40 percent of all nonfarm employment in the state in 1960 to less than 25 percent now . <> <> ' Has Suffered Longer ' // In one way , New Jersey may be suffering less because it has suffered longer . " Nationally , " Dr. Freund said , " the recession has been deep and protracted . In New Jersey , though , its impact has been extremely mild. " // New Jersey , the economist noted , no longer has a heavy concentration in the rubber , automobile or steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve them . New Jersey , he said , " is simply not the state it was 10 years ago . We ' ve achieved a diversity of the economy that is truly impressive. " // Some of Dr. Freund ' s optimism stems from the fact that he disputes the figures of the Bureau of Labor Statistics . " I ' ve had a running battle with those figures for years , " he said . " The State Labor Department totals are far more accurate . " The state figures put New Jersey unemployment at just over 8 percent , well below the figure for other industrial states in the Northeast. // Robert J. Ferguson , president of the First National State Bank of New Jersey , agreed . " It ' s hard for me to believe that we could be worse than New York , " he said . " The recession is continuing , but nothing I see shows it to be that bad. " // There are other pluses on the New Jersey economic scene . Construction is one of them , ranging from building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Somerset and Morris Counties to the construction of a nuclear power generating plant in Salem County. // In Atlantic City , many jobs have resulted from the gambling casinos , although casino construction has slowed . At the end of 1981 , the nine casinos there employed just under 28 , 000 people. // But despite these and other gains , there were 335 , 000 people out of work in New Jersey last month , 49 , 000 more than in April 1981 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . State Labor Department numbers put the April 1982 total at about 328 , 000 . Regardless of which system is most accurate , the Kean administration has made the creation of jobs one of its top priorities. // " We want to do it by improving the climate here for industry , " the Governor said in an interview . Acknowledging that most of his State House predecessors had said much the same thing , Mr. Kean added : " They never paid anything but lip service . There has never been an overall , coordinated effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now. " // The Governor ' s industrial development program includes tax abatements as well as plans to cut corporate taxes , which are now generally acknowledged to be among the highest in the region . <> <> Jobless Benefits at Issue // Mr. Kean and business community leaders such as Mr. Ferguson , the banker , are also determined to cut New Jersey ' s high unemployment compensation costs . " We ' ve never been able to do anything about them in the past , " Mr. Ferguson said , " because of basic union dominance in this state. " // Charles Marciante , president of the New Jersey A.F.L.-C . I.O. , questions this line of attack . " That ' s just what a banker would say , " he said . " The problem is not unemployment compensation ; the problem is the bankers themselves . It ' s the high cost of money that has everything lying dead in the water . The working man is caught in the middle of an economic chess game. " // The working man of whom he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trenton and Camden is largely not of those cities ' making . For example , in Newark , once almost entirely a manufacturing city , unemployment is now at 20 percent of the work force . Among young men under the age of 25 , it is 30 percent . Many Newark youths have never held a steady job . <> <> Retraining Suggested // What is particularly tragic in the eyes of New Jersey officials and planners is the apparent impossibility of combining the unemployed of the central city with the commercial jobs being created in the corporate headquarters and in the " high tech " companies of the outer suburban ring. // " The people being displaced in the cities are not the ones being hired in these new jobs , " Dr. Sternlieb of Rutgers said . " Perhaps it ' s more important to retrain them than to bring back manufacturing. " // To Governor Kean , the key to bringing the people to the jobs is transportation . " It ' s almost impossible to get from the inner city to the suburbs and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in poor shape , and unfortunately it ' s falling further and further behind. " // The reaction of the Democratic-controlled Legislature to the Governor ' s transportation program - it turned down his plan for a gasoline surtax to be used for highways and mass transit - may hold a clue to the problems ahead for the rest of his economic development package . Democratic-led legislatures are not known to favor cuts in corporate taxes , particularly during recessions. //
