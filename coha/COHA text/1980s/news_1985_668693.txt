" Cagney and Lacey , " a CBS series about two New York City policewomen , is one of the most critically acclaimed programs on television . Last year it won six Emmys , including the one for best dramatic series . But this week , officers Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey let down their audience by enlisting in the campaign to preserve abortion rights . The episode , revolving around the bombing of an abortion clinic , could have done justice to the opposing partisans and to the demands of television entertainment . Instead , it offered shrill propaganda . Faced with complaints from anti-abortion groups , CBS stood by its show . " We think it was fair and balanced , that it presented both sides , " a network spokesman said . Calls to its offices ran 2-1 in support , he said . The embarrassing question for CBS is why a " fair and balanced " show would draw criticism from anti-abortion groups but praise from their opponents . The explanation is simple . Posing as drama , the program was a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present the opposing view . The subject of the show tended to throw a bad light on everyone in the anti-abortion movement , even though few of them endorse violence . Worse , the bomber in this case turned out to be a member of a legitimate right-to-life group . Worse still , both officers treated the violent and nonviolent elements of the movement as indistinguishable . Told by the head of an anti-abortion group that picketing clinics " is a legitimate form of protest , " Cagney retorts angrily , " Not when it leads to violence . " The " balance " in the program was provided by the two policewomen  --  Lacey passionately upholding the right of every woman " to make up her own mind about her own body , " Cagney plagued by doubts stemming from her Catholic upbringing . Lacey never wavers from her conviction . As a pregnant 19-year-old , we learn , she had gotten an abortion in Puerto Rico rather than risk an illegal back-alley job . Her case gets support from the devoted doctor at the abortion clinic and from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have a baby and go on welfare . But Cagney flounders , unable to come up with any good reasons for her reservations . Her father , a crude stereotype , upbraids her . " It is a mortal sin ! " he shouts . " People a lot smarter than me spent a lot of time figuring this thing out . " Pressed on what a woman should do with an unwanted fetus , he snaps , " It ' s not a man ' s problem . " Not surprisingly , Cagney comes around to Lacey ' s point of view . Nowhere in the program do intelligent abortion foes get the chance to state their case . The point is to suggest that there is no intelligent case against abortion  --  only religious hysteria . The heartlessness of anti-abortion groups is set against pathetic tales of those who would suffer without legal abortion  --  teenage girls who don ' t want to bring fatherless children into the world , disabled men who can ' t support children , plucky minority women who aspire to improve their lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . No one in this episode thought to ask if a baby is truly better off dead than fatherless . No one asked if the sacrifice of one ' s education isn ' t preferable to snuffing out a human life . No one asked why couples who take the risks involved in sex shouldn ' t be obliged to accept the consequence of their actions . By ignoring questions like these , " Cagney and Lacey " made abortion look as wholesome as mother ' s milk , an act that produces only benefits . Abortion does simplify the lives of people who don ' t want the babies they ' ve conceived . So would infanticide . In both cases , the price is too high . It is easy to dramatize the suffering of women with unwanted pregnancies . It is not so easy to dramatize the hidden destruction of a living , breathing human being in his mother ' s womb . If and when " Cagney and Lacey " gets off its " pro-choice " soapbox to confront the reality of abortion , the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
