On Oct. 9 , 1986 , one day before the Reykjavik summit , Ratushinskaya ( pronounced Ra-too-SHIN-skuh-yah ) had been freed after serving four of the seven years of her sentence for anti-Soviet propaganda - to wit , her poetry and the letters she wrote with her husband in behalf of Andrei Sakharov. // // In part a response to pressure brought to bear by the world literary community , in part an aspect of Gorbachev ' s strategy of glasnost , her release came as a surprise to her. // Thus , Ratushinskaya reached the West two years after her book of prison verse did in the spring of 1985 . Her book , now published in English translation ( with Russian on facing pages ) , is more than a document in the endless history of cruelty and suffering imposed on creative people by the Soviet communist regime. // The true nature of the book is suggested by the strange path it took on its way West. // While she was 300 miles southeast of Moscow in the strict-regime camp at Barashevo , Ratushinskaya ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had either memorized them or had received copies from those who had . Once Gerashchenko had the completed book , he sent a typed Russian copy to the translators of this volume. // How did the poems come to be composed ? Ratushinskaya was not allowed to have paper . After all , she was in prison precisely because she wrote ' ' beyond the limit . ' ' Ratushinskaya composed her verses on bars of soap . After she had polished and memorized them , she washed her hands , destroying the incriminating evidence . Ratushinskaya ' s hands were clean ! // Later , at night , she would recite the lines to her fellow prisoners . Eventually they too knew her poems by heart. // Recited and memorized by the prisoners , the poems became part of the inner life of the prison. // Indeed , these poems bear witness to a specifically human mode of consciousness , a kind of throwing of the self into a potential future , imaginary and historical , an inner realm of freedom , vertiginous at times , at times gently consoling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the present. // ' ' Beyond the Limit ' ' is quite simply a marvelous book of poetry . Far more than a miscellany , it has the unity of Keats ' s odes or Catullus ' poems or Shakespeare ' s sonnets . Composed during the first 17 months of her term , 42 out of 47 are dated . As a whole , the book clearly shows the growth of the poet ' s understanding of what it means to go - or be pushed - beyond the limit. // The work is intimately tied to its context . Ratushinskaya addresses several prisoners by name , and the notes indicate the fate of some of them . Many poems describe the conditions of prison life , the cold of the isolation cell where prisoners were allowed only light dress - no blankets , no jacket - and slippers contaminated by previous occupants. // In a poem composed in August 1984 , at the end of the miraculous period of creativity ( on July 2 , for example , she wrote two big poems ! ) , a grating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick grating but no glass , and the grating becomes a universal symbol . ' ' As for the grating that can never go away -/ through a grating , vision is sharper. ' ' // Ratushinskaya ' s sharp vision is universal - and not unrelated to her awareness of her religious roots in the Polish Roman Catholicism of her grandparents . The poems are also varied in tone , imagery , and genre . Lullabies follow plain , confessional poems ; historical scenes , visions . There is irony and apocalypse , intimacy and historical sweep. // And bad as the situation was , ' ' Beyond the Limit ' ' is a triumph of the human spirit . It describes a spiritual rebirth. // Referring to an occasion when it took six men to force feed her during a hunger strike , an early ( November 1983 ) poem begins , // ' ' I ' ll live through this , survive , and they ' ll ask me : / how they beat my head on the prison cot , / how it froze during the nights. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that she ' ll honor ' ' the dry September ' ' - presumably the September of 1982 in which she was arrested by the KGB - as her ' ' second birth. ' ' // In another poem , she address Tanya Osipova , an older prisoner whom she befriended and with whom she shared a freezing punishment cell for much of December 1983 . Both were in need of medical care , both sacrificed themselves to bring attention to the condition of another prisoner who was critically ill . They fasted. // The poet says : ' ' How could two such voiceless ones not sing together ? ' ' // Ratushinskaya communicates her special hope-in-despair by exploiting the many aspects of the future tense . Throughout the collection , the future is tangible , pressing , urgent , and conveyed as exhortation , promise , threat , desire , wish , and vision. // ' ' I wish , ' ' says the poet ; ' ' Let us , ' ' she says . One poem of flight begins , ' ' This evening is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a desire-filled future tense : ' ' We ' ll fill our pockets/ with sugar drops. ' ' // Thanks to this volume , many will wish to take the long walk with her . Tender or angry or rapt , Ratushinskaya ' s voice carries these sometimes merely accurate translations. // Very occasionally a book comes along that not only makes news , but history . ' ' Beyond the Limit ' ' is such a book . Indeed , the time Ratushinskaya spent at Barashevo must be a special time for all who love poetry and freedom , and the isolation cell a special place . From it , Ratushinskaya addresses not only fellow zeks , but all mankind . <> <> Poem 32 from ' Beyond the Limit ' <> <> And for the cry from the well of ' ' Mama !
