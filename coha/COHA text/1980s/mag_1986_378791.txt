When Alan Schneider died in London in 1984 as a result of injuries sustained in a traffic accident , the American theater lost a director who had staged the U.S. or world premieres of Samuel Beckett 's Waiting for Godot and Endgame , Edward Albee 's Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? and Tennessee Williams ' Slapstick Tragedy . Schneider personified the central virtue , and failing , of serious American stage artists : he so prized his integrity that he generally disdained Broadway and mistrusted popular success . He spent most of his later years directing novices at regional or university theaters , rather than have to contend with commercial pressures . Schneider spoke often of the need for a unified American theater , yet his vision left little room for the kinds of productions that average citizens remember with pleasure . While others were bemoaning the economic decline of Broadway , Schneider seemed to look forward to its demise . <P> Given his intellectual ferocity , any book by Schneider might well have turned into a manifesto . Yet this posthumous memoir , completed nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by self-criticism and generosity toward actors than by its hostility to the theater establishment of producers , critics and other spokesmen for popular tastes . Like Schneider 's productions , his autobiography displays an earnest search for truth at whatever cost to the seeker . <P> As Albee notes in the foreword , " Alan 's prose does not change its tone no matter the event , and if you are rushing through the inconsequential you may very well miss the momentous . " There is plenty of both . The opening chapters are acutely felt remembrances of childhood as a Jewish outsider , the son of two physicians , in revolutionary Russia and then in rural America . Other children mockingly asked whether he had had pencils in " Rooshia " ; a teacher sneered that he of all people should know the meaning of " usury . " Arresting as these cherished grievances are , Schneider does little to explain how they shaped his artistic vision . <P> Next , his young manhood is retailed at too great length , in a mournful chronicle of false starts , wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted taking . Schneider alludes too briefly to two fundamental debates : between devotees of an external , technical approach to acting and believers in the Actors Studio " method " of fusing a character with one 's own psyche ; between " realist " writers who seek to simulate life and " theatricalists " who emphasize that they are staging an artifice , a show . He unflatteringly evokes such figures as Walter Kerr and Mary Martin , and demonstrates by his own example that success in the theater is neither enduring nor necessarily lucrative .
