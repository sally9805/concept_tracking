WASHINGTON  --  June ' s surprisingly steep drop in the jobless rate to 5. 3% of the civilian labor force reflects a rapidly growing economy that increases fears of inflation and higher interest rates . The decline from a 5. 6% rate in May reflected widespread employment gains and brought joblessness to its lowest level since May 1974 , when it was 5. 1% , the Labor Department said . By bringing the rate further below a level that many analysts consider " full employment , " the drop puts significant additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten credit conditions . The central bank already has tightened three times this year . " It ' s with regret that we now have to get seriously worried about inflation , " said Roger Brinner , director of U.S. forecasting at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington , Mass . " I would prefer that another million people could get employed , but we have a labor market that even an optimist would call unbalanced at this point . " Earlier this year , Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggered an inflationary acceleration until it had " slipped down to the low five percents . " He is scheduled to testify Wednesday on Capitol Hill , where he will undoubtedly be asked to elaborate . Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Lee Hoskins said Friday the employment numbers " are confirmation that the economy is still robust . " And San Francisco Fed President Robert Parry said the numbers show " the economy continues to expand at a pretty good clip . " Both men are members of the Fed ' s policy committee , and have been pushing their colleagues to adopt a tighter policy . In a separate report , the Federal Reserve said slow growth in auto credit held the rise in consumer credit in May to a 4. 6% annual rate , compared with a 7. 3% pace in April . Total non-farm payrolls rose a healthy 346 , 000 last month , the Labor Department reported , after a revised 221 , 000-job May rise , previously reported as 209 , 000 . Manufacturing jobs increased by 45 , 000 after a gain of 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for Vice President George Bush and other Republican candidates . More voters are employed now , while whatever inflation effects there may be won ' t show up until later . And any credit-tightening by the Fed isn ' t likely to have a significant damping effect until after the November election . President Reagan hailed the figures . " I predict 1988 will be a banner year for Republicans because it ' s a banner year for peace and prosperity , " he told reporters at the White House , calling the report " more solid evidence that the economy ' s on the right track . " The economy ' s service sector gained a strong 241 , 000 jobs in June after a 192 , 000-job rise in May . Total goods-producing employment , which includes construction and mining as well as manufacturing , was up 105 , 000 after rising 29 , 000 in May . Some economists contend that the unemployment rate can fall considerably further before an acceleration in inflation results , and the report did contain several indications that inflation isn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 34. 8 from 34. 7 , but factory hours and overtime held steady . Average hourly earnings were unchanged at $9. 27 . The department ' s hourly earnings index , which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials , slipped to 178. 5% of its 1977 average from 178. 6% . The department ' s survey of households , which is used in calculating the unemployment rate , showed that employment increased by 823 , 000 in June after falling by 518 , 000 in May . Three-fourths of the increase in employment occurred among 16-24 year olds , however . That big gain partly reflects the fact that the survey was taken unusually late in June , giving student job-seekers more time to find work . The jobless rate last month fell most sharply for black teen-agers , to 28. 4% from 34. 8% . That was still more than double the 12% rate for white teen-agers . The Fed report showed that May ' s $2. 42 billion increase in consumer credit followed a revised $3. 85 billion increase in April , previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $597 million in May after rising $1. 81 billion in April . Revolving credit , which includes retail and bank-card borrowing , rose $1. 69 billion in the latest month , after expanding $1. 71 billion the month before . Mobile home credit declined $60 million after increasing $32 million in April . Miscellaneous credit , including cash loans and certain retail financial contracts , expanded $196 million after rising $301 million the month before . At the end of the latest month , consumer installment debt totaled $631. 77 billion , up 9. 4% from a year earlier . The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation .
