But when asked if they believe that Jews are the offspring of Satan , Kerry Noble , the leader of the Covenant , which is the political and paramilitary arm of the church of Zarepath-Horeb , says simply , " Yes , we believe that. " // And should all " racial Jews , " in Mr. Noble ' s terminology , be eliminated ? // " Not at this point , " Mr. Noble replies . " In the future , I think all of you who are Aryans are going to wake up to the truth and whatever actions you take is your choice . " <> <> Anti-Semitic Link Seen // Mr. Noble , an affable man with a slow , bright smile , was interviewed at a motel here where members of the sect were housed after a heavily armed force of up to 300 state and Federal officers peacefully took control Monday of the 224-acre Covenant camp in the Ozark mountains near here after a four-day standoff. // The Covenant is only one of the extreme right-wing groups under investigation by the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which investigators say continue to emerge , are not so much organizational as religious , based on the violently anti-Semitic teachings of sects referred to collectively as the Christian Identity Movement . They hold that Jews are the offspring of Satan , and , according to the most extreme doctrine , should be exterminated. // Inside the rough-hewn Covenant camp , searchers found an arsenal that included submachine guns , grenades , an antitank rocket , plastic explosives and a quantity of other explosives. // There were remnants of a minefield , an armored vehicle with gunports was under construction and the searchers found a cache of neo-Nazi hate literature . In a paramilitary training area called Silhouette City , the cutout figure the used for target practice was a state trooper . On his chest was drawn a Star of David . <> <> Denver Killing Cited // The searchers also found a converted submachine gun virtually identical to the weapons used to kill Alan Berg , a talk show host in Denver , a year ago and a Missouri state trooper two weeks ago . One rough-hewn building housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , described as " a small but efficient bomb factory. " // Hiding in the camp were four members of the neo-Nazi group called the Order . They finally surrendered to Federal officers. // The Government said in a 57-count indictment that the Order was responsible for a wave of violence that included arson , murder , counterfeiting and armed robberies that netted more than $4 million. // The surrender of the four at the Covenant camp , coupled with the disclosure that other members of the Order had lived and trained at the camp , as well as the arrests of other members in the vicinity , forged what investigators said was a definite link between the Order and the Covenant. // According to Federal investigators , civil rights groups and others who monitor the extreme right wing , the Order and the Covenant are , in turn , tied to other extreme racist groups ranging from the Ku Klux Klan to the Aryan Nations , a neo-Nazi group in Hayden Lake , Idaho , of which the Order is a splinter group. 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has is not known . Mr. Noble maintains there are two million across the country , but that appears to be an exaggeration . A leading purveyor of the Identity doctrine in its most extreme form is 65-year-old Richard Girnt Butler , pastor of the Aryan Nation ' s Church of Jesus Christ Christian . The group claims a mailing list of 6 , 000 , but its active membership is no more than 500 , according to groups that monitor the extremist organizations. // About five right-wing extremist groups allied to the Identity movement are being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation , acting under a 1970 statute that provides for 20-year jail sentences for members of groups defined as " racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations. " // Originally a weapon against traditional organized crime , the Government is now using the statute against violent extremist groups . On April 12 in Seattle , the Government indicted 24 members of the Order , charging that it constituted a criminal enterprise responsible for the murders of Mr. Berg and another man suspected of being an informer ; the attempted murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed robberies that included the paramilitary assault on a Brinks truck in Ukiah , Calif. , that netted $3. 6 million ; counterfeiting , and a plot to rob the Brink ' s vault in San Francisco of $30 million. 23 of 24 iin Custody United States Attorney Gene Anderson of Seattle maintains that the Order itself has been " neutralized " by indictments and arrests ; 23 of the 24 indicted members are in custody , along with several others not named in the indictment but arrested on other charges. // The Order ' s objective was the violent overthrow of the Government . In a " Declaration of War " uncovered by investigators in November and signed by 12 members of the Order , the group ' s leader , Robert Jay Mathews , wrote : " The Aryan yeomanry is awakening . A long forgotten wind is starting to blow . Do you hear the approaching thunder ? It is that of the awakend Saxon . War is upon the land. " // The document , which claimed " a territorial imperative which will consist of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its signers as " soldiers of the Aryan Resistance Movement " and concluded , " Let friend and foe alike be made aware , this is war ! " // The war was to be against " the ZOG , " or " Zionist Occupation Government of North America. " // Mr. Mathews died Dec. 7 in a fire ignited by an illumination flare dropped by a Government helicopter at the conclusion of a seige in which he held off more than 100 Federal and state officers with a machinegun for 36 hours. // Based on mounting evidence that the " Declaration of War " had a real basis - the Order then had more than $4 million in cash with which to arm itself - four Federal agencies , the F.B.I. , the Secret Service , the United States Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms mounted a nationwide manhunt for identified members of the Order still at large. // Among the last to be taken was 22-year-old David Charles Tate . Before he was finally arrested after a five-day search in the rugged Ozark Mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gunned down a Missouri state trooper with a silenced automatic weapon and fled on foot into the woods . The weapon used , a MAC-10 submachine gun that had been expertly altered from legal single-fire status to an illegal automatic weapon capable of firing 1 , 000 rounds a minute , was almost identical to one found in the search of the Covenant compound a week later . Another virutally identical silenced submachine gun was also used to kill Mr. Berg. // Mr. Tate , who had been at the Aryan Nations compound in Idaho for the past several years , had also been a resident at the Covenant camp for a time two years ago , and had taken part in the group ' s paramilitary exercises. // Another key member of the Order , 33-year-old Randall Rader , known by the code name " The Field Marshal , " who had been responsible for the paramilitary training of the Order ' s members , had been a resident at the Covenant compound from 1973 through 1982 , according to Mr. Noble , and had been the leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " no connection " between the Covenant and the Order . He did concede that Richard Butler , the head of the Aryan Nations , of which the Order is a splinter group , had visited the Covenant encampment in 1982. // The founder and spiritual leader of the Covenant group , Jim Ellison , 44 , surrendered peacefully Monday to Federal authorities who had surrounded the compound. // He was charged with leading a conspiracy to manufacture and sell illegal submachine guns and silencers over a three-year period . Investigators believe some of the weapons may have been distributed to other rightwing individuals and groups. // The Covenant group , which grew to about 150 members at its peak , stockpiled weapons , food and valuables for barter and engaged in extensive paramilitary training. // Women were given a subservient role - " This nation was founded on racism and sexism , " Mr. Noble said. // The scriptural underpinning for the group ' s militarism , he said , is contained in Matthew 10 : 34 , " Think not that I am come to send peace on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword.
