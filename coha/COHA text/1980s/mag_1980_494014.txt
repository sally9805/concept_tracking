Nick 's Picks . . . Bart 's Charts When we last left our mythical investment fund , the stock market was riding the crest of post-election euphoria . The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered around the 1,000 mark . Then reality set m , with prime rates leaping from 14.5 percent to 20 percent in just over one month and Soviet troops massing on Poland 's borders . A few weeks ago the discussion was of a rn past and a bright economic future with Reagan ecessio at the helm . Now the talk focuses on international tensions and how severe the com- ing recession will be . The Dow Jones Average has responded by dropping almost 70 points . And it has n't been a great month for our portfolio either ? with one excep ? tion , all our investments have declined in value . Several of our investments , however , have been front-page news . A Federal Trade Commission judge ordered Beatrice Foods to divest itself of Tropicana Products , the nation 's largest citrus juice processor , and , in an unprece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be turned over to the US Treasury . ( The New York Times , never missing an opportunity for a pun , reported that Beatrice 's ownership of Tropicana created an illegal , anticompetitive " concentration " in the frozen orange juice business . ) Bea- trice is appealing the decision , of course , and the process is sure to drag on for years . The FTC had tend to block the acquisition of Tropicana in 1978 , but was overturned by higher courts . In any case , our Beatrice bonds actually registered a slight gain due to the fact that they already had suffered a large decline , and no matter what the outcome , Beatrice will remain the nation 's largest diversified food company , with Dannon yogurt , La Choy oriental foods , and Clark candy bars under its corporate roof . Our other newsrnaker was Chrysler . President Lee Iacocca called the Federal Reserve 's tightening credit poli ? cies " madness " and blamed them for ruining Chrysler 's hopes for a fourth-quarter profit . ( Who does the Fed think it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Iacocca journeyed to Washington , hoping that federal coffers had n't emptied entirely , and announced a cash rebate plan tied to the prime rate . Iacocca 's logic : the greater the interest rate , the greater the rebate , thereby overcoming the negative impact of high interest costs . The market remained unimpressed , and our Chrysler bonds took a nosedive . Our biggest loser of the month was our holding in pork bellies futures . But although it was down significantly this time , our original investment was only $96,000 , so we still are left with a healthy 450 percent gain . By the way , the surge in our bellies has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the price of bacon at your grocery store . One pound of bacon went for one dollar in New York shortly before we invested ; today it costs about $2.50 . Live cattlefutures also took a major drop this time , and if they decline much more ( about 2i1 cents a pound ) we will either have to co Our up with more money or lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our last round , following the general decline of both the stork and bond markets . But once again , rising interest rates meant a better return from Dreyfus Liquid Assets , our money ur market fund . We averaged 12.4 percent interest in the last month , or $1,698 . In the last week the yield has climbed to 13.5 percent and the end is not yet in sight . Should we get rid of any of our " dogs " in order to claim a tax loss ? Well , so far we have n't sold any of our holdings , so we do n't have any gains on which we must pay taxes . Once we sell our pork bellies contracts we 'll have a large tax bill , but we 're not going to sell them before December 20 ? six months of ter we purchased them , when they become long ? term capital gains , taxable at a lower rate than short-term gains . And at that point well probably be tempted to hold on to them for at least another 12 days in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what happened next time . With the interest we collected , we now have $239,116 in Dreyfus Liquid Assets to begin round six . This month 's selection will be Gulf Oil . Gulf is trading at $4494 , which allows us to buy 2,250 shares for $99,563 with $996 ( one percent ) going to our broker as commission . crime pay ? If it does , should we be investing our hard-earned drachmas in criminal concerns ? No general answer emerges when you go down the list and see the names of so many famous American businesses . Over the long term , who would ever bet against DuPont , a great name on Fortune 's " Roster of Wrongdoing " ? ( You 'd expect that title from Ralph Nader but never Time , Inc. , which , by the by , is on it through a subsid ? iary involved in the great price-fixing case in the fold ? ing carton industry . ) US Steel is on it , but even if they change their name to US Steal , from the investor 's point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a turkey roost . On a case by case basis , no one industry group seems to dominate the roster , so let 's arbitrarily start with the three- and four-time losers , the corporations that would , if they were flesh and blood and not legal fictions , be called recidivists . Take Braniff Interna ? tional : four trips to court in the last 10 years in cases involving slush funds and criminal restraint of trade .
