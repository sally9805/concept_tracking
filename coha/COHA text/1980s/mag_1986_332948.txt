The country is an international pariah , isolated from much of the world and at odds with both superpowers . Its ruler is an 86-year-old cleric who lives in near seclusion . For almost six years , it has been mired in a grinding and inglorious war that seems to drag on without end . Reduced to using 20-year- old technology against an enemy that boasts six times as much combat aircraft and four times as much artillery , it has lost an estimated 250,000 lives and still spends $7 billion a year to keep up the fight . <P> Yet for all its problems , Iran under the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini seems increasingly confident and active . Earlier this month Tehran persuaded its partners in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit oil production and thus push up the price . Last week it received two high-level envoys from Syrian President Hafez Assad , the most influential power broker in the Arab world , who called the alliance between the two countries " invulnerable . " Now Iran is negotiating with France for the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Ayatullah came to power in 1980 . <P> On the military front , Khomeini 's forces remain fiercely motivated after two crucial victories this year against the troops of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Iran recently launched a new drive to create 1,000 new battalions of Revolutionary Guards . Many experts say Khomeini is preparing an all-out assault against Basra , Iraq 's second largest city , in an effort to break the deadlock in the war . Says a senior international-relief official who has worked on both sides of the marshy trenches : " The Iranians are certainly beginning to act as if victory is now within reach . " <P> At home , however , the Khomeini regime is increasingly harassed by the People 's Mujahedin guerrillas . Last week a car bomb exploded in the bustling heart of the capital during rush hour , leaving 20 people dead . Three days earlier a similar explosion took 13 lives in the holy city of Qom . By week 's end the government claimed to have crushed two Iraqi-sponsored " terrorist networks , " made up of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombings . In London , another bomb shattered a video store belonging to Reza Fazeli , a vocal Khomeini critic . Tehran and the mujahedin blamed each other for the blast , which killed Fazeli 's 22-year-old son Bijan . <P> Iran 's conflicts at home and abroad have only inflamed popular zeal for Khomeini 's Islamic revolution and its militant embrace of Muslim fundamentalism . When Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani delivered his latest call to arms last week in the northeastern city of Mashad , thousands of cheering young men seemed ready to lay down their lives for the cause of their homeland . " Every day , " reports a Western visitor to Tehran , " there are parades for people going to the front . People are still chanting , ' Death to America ! Death to Saddam ! ' Death to just about everything . "
