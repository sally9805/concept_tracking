( In the darkness we hear night noises  --  the sound of wind , wings ; something scuttles , almost laughs ; an owl calls . As if on the periphery of vision , we see the briefest flash of a coal-black feather , catch the reflection of an unseen movement , almost glimpse a white shadow in a corner . Revealed by the growing light is an old Native woman , VITALINE , sitting in her cabin . Her presence is electric , her energy a lightning rod , yet she appears calm , still . As the sounds build around her , she gathers power , throws back her head , and screams . A flash . VITALINE transforms into COYOTE . Masked spirits appear . They are humorous , sensual , deadly . ) BEAR She 's doing something WOLVERINE She wants something COYOTE She 's going fast , could be too fast BEAR Maybe not , Coyote , maybe not COYOTE You 're right , maybe it 's too slow BEAR She 's one of the last ones who knows how to surprise us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , they were cheering me , they could n't believe how I moved WOLVERINE I 'd been stalking him for weeks , he was almost mad .

There are no leaves , the sun is covered in dust , everything is in a haze and when I throw my head back to to make the leaves come on the trees , there 's nothing but a rasping sound , like death . I feel like an old withered pile of bones , I feel sucked dry . I 've used and misused the gifts you 've given me , and I 've just come to an end . I ca n't go back and I ca n't go forward . Hear me , I 'm asking you to help me . ( The Spirits murmur in acknowledgement . ) CROW I 've changed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horny " here has any light to shed , we let her do her stuff .

" And we said , " No , let us fight . " ( SAM passes out and CROW covers him tenderly with a blanket . Lightning quick , WOLVERINE moves toward JESSICA . The other spirits back away. ) p. 59 WOLVERINE Let her see what she hides , let her know fear beyond fear . Let her find her claws and see if she knows what to do with them . Let her look in the mirror and see a face with no soul . Let her know nothing , no worth , not to walk the earth , no right , no reason , let the blood drip from her mouth , let her bite through the bone , let her moan , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ground revenge let her howl . Revenge . Her claws tear the flesh of the face with no soul . Let us see what she is made of . Let her be nothing , a nothing , not a thing at all . ( WOLVERINE transforms into BOB , a successful lawyer , sitting behind his desk . JESSICA stands frozen , locked in time , even though the scene is about to begin . CROW fills in for JESSICA , sitting in the Lawyer 's Office , crossing his legs carefully . ) BOB Do n't get me wrong . I 've always thought the halfway house board did the right thing in hiring you . At least the meetings are a lot more exciting since you took over . But I 'm still going to resign . CROW/JESSICA Maybe you should try the ballet next time . BOB I find I do n't have the time for things that are important to me , like my family , and as I 'm planning to go into politics , I CROW/JESSICA You are ? BOB I ca n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone ( JESSICA takes control and enters BOB 's office. ) p. 60 CROW/JESSICA I keep getting into trouble , offending everybody JESSICA ( To CROW . ) You sure do . CROW ( To JESSICA . ) I should hire myself out : " Late for a meeting ? Call Crow , Spirit-guiding with a difference " JESSICA If I 'm offending anybody , I 'll do it myself now . ( JESSICA changes places with CROW . BOB continues as if nothing has happened . ) BOB There 's a difference between dishonesty and diplomacy , if you could learn a little diplomacy , I think things would go easier for you . JESSICA They want me to act like someone with their B.A. in social work and I ca n't . BOB You mean you wo n't . JESSICA I wo n't . CROW You mean you ca n't . JESSICA ( Confused . ) I mean I ca  --  I wo  --  I need your help . BOB What kind of help ? JESSICA How to talk to Presbyterian bankers , how to handle the publicity we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application forms I ca n't even spell , I 've got a grade-six education . p. 61 BOB You do very well with it . JESSICA You 're the closest thing to a human being I 've met in that place . BOB Thank you , I feel the same way about you . JESSICA I was hoping you could take me through a few basic tricks , business things and then maybe someday I could do something for you . CROW You 've got nothing to offer . It 's a bad deal . BOB It all depends on how far you 're willing to go . Often in a certain league there 's a necessity for what seems like brutality , but it 's usually a clean kill , something expected , even respected . I 'm not interested in dealing with innocents or do-gooders . JESSICA I 'm sick of begging , and I 'm not afraid of a little blood . BOB No ? CROW Go for the heart , if you can find it . JESSICA More and more girls are arriving at the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot up , you name it , it 's like the city 's gone wild . They 've got nowhere else to go CROW Lady H. , she is so beautiful JESSICA A guy came in the other day who had n't eaten in a week . When was the last time you did n't eat in a week ? p. 62 CROW When he was on the Scarsdale diet . BOB When I was on the Scarsdale diet Sorry , but you looked so earnest , I could n't resist . You see , I do n't believe you can change people with these programs . You 're different , you got out on your own . CROW On her own ? JESSICA You remind me of a lot of men I used to know . BOB Is that good or bad ? JESSICA Neither . BOB Keep your idealism if you like , but do n't waste my time . What you want is a basic night-school course . JESSICA I could make you do it . BOB How ? JESSICA Let 's just say I kept you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better still , forget the whole thing . Oh , no . ( Sharp strings : JESSICA freezes BOB , time and space warp . CROW hides under his wing . Strobe to Vitaline 's kitchen . VITALINE is sitting with the UNICORN . ) VITALINE Jessica ! She thinks she 's so smart and now he 's trapped her . She 's gon na be in trouble now . UNICORN She ca n't help it . It 's the part of her that is n't real . She thinks she does n't have to play by the rules . p. 63 VITALINE Wolverine plays for real . UNICORN But he 's so obvious . CROW ( To JESSICA . ) You better stop now or he might not come back . ( JESSICA releases BOB . He has caught a glimpse of a room and a unicorn . BOB sinks into his chair , JESSICA is drained . ) JESSICA Sorry , I should n't have done that . BOB What are you ? JESSICA I 'm a a sorcerer 's apprentice . BOB Do n't play games with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I think you like it . BOB Well I do n't . JESSICA You 're not supposed to use it for yourself , but I could get money , change people 's minds , I could help people CROW That 's what they all say when they start . BOB What do you really want from me ? JESSICA Now I just go where it takes me . It took me to you . BOB What 's " it " ? JESSICA You 'd call it witchcraft. p. 64 CROW You 'd call it bullshit . BOB There 's a lot of bullshit associated with that word . JESSICA I do n't usually do party tricks . CROW The hell you do n't . BOB The hell you do n't . JESSICA What did you just see ? BOB I saw All right , it 's true , I 've always been interested in in nonordinary reality , but I can never relate to a crowd that wears crystals on their Birkenstocks . JESSICA I could teach you . CROW No you could n't . BOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean ? BOB You 'll see . Are you married ? JESSICA No . BOB Living with anyone ? JESSICA Nothing serious . CROW What ? JESSICA There 's a board meeting tonight , are you coming ? BOB I think I can arrange it . We should start with two one-hour sessions a week . Mysticism on Tuesdays , corporate behaviour on Thursdays . p. 65 JESSICA Thank you . Do we call this friendship ? BOB I 'm never friends with an attractive woman , it always costs too much . ( BOB transforms into WOLVERINE . The Spirits move quickly in unison . JESSICA enters the Apartment , months later . SAM is sleeping on the couch ; he 's fallen on bad times . JESSICA comes in , wrung out . ) SAM Hey , where 've you been , I missed you ( He goes to embrace JESSICA . She pulls away and starts cleaning up . ) What 's the matter with you lately ? JESSICA Nothing . SAM The kids wo n't be home for hours , let 's do some wrestling It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . SAM You mean you do n't want to . JESSICA It 's not that . SAM Just talk to me , I 'm not blind , you know ( JESSICA starts to fall apart . ) Are you crying again ? You 're going to dehydrate with all the crying that 's going on JESSICA I 'm just a bit strange right now , that 's all . I 'm picking up on all kinds of things and I 'm not used to it p. 66 SAM Every time you come back from seeing that old lady , you get like this . You start moaning around with this weird look on your face , the kids do n't know who you are anymore JESSICA It 's just a stage . SAM Are you sure ? You 're using your moods to get things . You walk into a place looking all weak and pathetic and people come running JESSICA You 've got to give me some room . SAM I 've been giving you all kinds of room . The more room I give you , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never let a man get close before because I was afraid he 'd take something from me . SAM You 've got everything I got to give , there has to be some taking back in the bargain . JESSICA It 's like there 's a place I 've got inside that men always seem to want . Sometimes they do n't even want me , they just want to find out what 's in that place , and I wo n't let them , I wo n't let you , I wo n't let anybody . It 's my secret until I find out what it is SAM You like having a secret , it makes you feel special . JESSICA Yes . SAM So you 're locking me out ? p. 67 JESSICA I do n't want to . SAM Take what away ? JESSICA I ca n't put a name on it SAM Take what away ? JESSICA My power . SAM That 's what 's going on , I knew it . My uncle was into medicine , I know what it does It makes you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for a minute JESSICA You do n't know what you 're talking about . SAM Pretty soon you 'll do anything just to show you can do it You 're getting it on with that lawyer are n't you ? JESSICA No . SAM Then come with me and prove it . JESSICA The thought of it makes me sick . SAM What 's he paying you ? Maybe I should fucking leave a hundred bucks under the pillow , and you 'd be hanging from the rafters JESSICA What would you pay me with , you have n't made a dime in months , you 've been living with me , drinking like a pig SAM That 's not true . JESSICA What were you doing in that motel room last night ? I saw her , you ca n't hide from me p. 68 SAM You 're one of them baby , that 's what the lawyer 's about and that 's what the old lady 's about You shoot for that high world , that 's what you really want , power , any way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore , you make them come to you JESSICA Strutting around like a big shot , talking up a storm in the bar because you ca n't make it , tom-catting all over town with anyone that 'll have you SAM If you 're a god-damn whore , let 's treat you like a whore ( SAM grabs JESSICA . He rips open her blouse , revealing a huge purple bruise on her shoulder . She winces . ) Where 'd you get that bruise ? ( She does n't answer . ) Where ? So the lawyer beats you up ? JESSICA That 's right , because he 's a strong man , not a chicken-shit coward , hiding behind my skirts , he beats me up like a man ( SAM hits her hard across the face . ) SAM Shut up . ( JESSICA gets away . SAM comes after her . ) You 'll do anything to get your way . Well , so will I. You hear that ? So will I ( They grapple . SAM is raging , but seems to be holding back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a fucking yellow coward , you ca n't even get it up you 're not even half a man ( SAM snaps . He punches JESSICA in the face . She falls to the floor , he begins beating her savagely , ending by punching her full force in the stomach . He finally stops himself as she screams . ) SAM ( Reaching for her . ) Baby you okay ? ( She pushes him away . ) I 'm sorry babe I 'm so sorry I ca n't afford to be gentle , all I know is that when I see red , I fight . It 's too dangerous any other way . You ca n't ask me why . I fight . That 's what I do . Somehow that 's what I 'm supposed to do but it gets all screwed up . There 's a place for it , I know there is , but I do n't know where . You look at me , all bruised up , and you think you 're the one that 's hurt , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you because I ca n't beat them , you 're just one step down from me , that 's all . You 're the one thing around that 's lower than me . You 've got ta support me , you 've got ta believe in me , even when I 'm an asshole Somewhere in this world I 've got to be right . They did take our balls away , and they hold them dangling in front of us while we rage around trying to get them back . All we 've got is rage . I can feel myself switching when I 'm strong , feel myself losing the Bear , he just walks away on me . You 've got your mysteries , all I 've got is that sometime I was a warrior . So I 'll get drunk , and sing , and pound the drum , and dance in the gutter . There 's got to be somebody out there dancing . That 's all that 's left of war . ( Instantly , UNICORN transforms into LIZ . LIZ enters the apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how are you doing ? Ooohh , not so good . ( To SAM . ) Did you do this ? You 're a shit . I 'll go get a cloth . ( LIZ goes to the kitchen . SAM is about to leave . ) JESSICA Do n't go away . SAM You want me to stay ? JESSICA Yes . SAM You keep switching on me , it 's driving me crazy . JESSICA I know , just do n't go away . SAM I wo n't . ( LIZ returns and begins wiping JESSICA 's face . ) LIZ ( To SAM . ) Any self-respecting man goes out and gets drunk after beating up his woman , and you 're going to sit there and watch me clean her up ? SAM That 's right . LIZ Well , at least have a beer or something , it does n't look right . SAM Jesus . ( He goes for a beer . ) LIZ ( To JESSICA . ) Did you ask for it ? JESSICA Sort of LIZ It 's better that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you p. 71 JESSICA There 's always a million bar stories . LIZ Like you 're trying to turn into a Black Panther , but at the same time you 're running around with some high-class lawyer who 's also a dogooder , you 've got a house for women too stupid to make it on their own , and you 're studying to be a witch . JESSICA Does n't sound like a bad life . ( They laugh a bit . ) Ouch ! I 'm getting into a lot of trouble trying to get some money together for the movement ( SAM enters with a beer . ) LIZ The only movement those guys know about is on the toilet seat with their pants down . Right Sam ? SAM That 's right . LIZ At least he 's steady . What about the witch business . ( JESSICA does n't answer . ) SAM That 's all you 'll get out of her . JESSICA I do n't talk about it because you do n't like me to . SAM That 's not why . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncer . Lots of muscle and warm at night , but do n't give him the inside story . JESSICA Okay , we have ceremonies , sometimes in the sweat lodge . The Spirits come , they talk p. 72 LIZ But what does it feel like ? JESSICA It tingles . SAM Tingles ? LIZ Does it tingle where I think it tingles ? JESSICA There 's nothing like it . When I feel them , and I 'm not scared out of my mind , it 's the highest I 've ever been . LIZ Like a hit ? JESSICA Like fishing . You feel the hook , it 's got you right in the pit of your stomach , and the Spirits are on the other end . They pull you , and you pull them , and sometimes they let everything go slack so you can wonder for a while . You know you could tear away but you do n't want to because you 're only sure of one thing , that there 's something on the other end . SAM How much do you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . SAM No doubts ? JESSICA Of course . I used to be terrible , Vitaline 'd get so mad . I 'd be checking the sweat lodge for tape recorders and secret entrances . She 'd say I was too modern , too white SAM Maybe you are . JESSICA But they love me , I know they do . p. 73 LIZ Can I come sometime , maybe get high with you ? ( Dark , languid music plays . WOLVERINE moves slowly toward the Apartment . WOLVERINE transforms into BOB . ) JESSICA I keep pushing it , I just keep pushing it ( LIZ fishes a mickey out of her purse . ) LIZ You need a shot , have some of this , beer 's for the poor . JESSICA I 'm not supposed to drink LIZ One shot wo n't hurt you JESSICA What the hell . ( She takes a swig of whisky . BOB enters the apartment .

It would just take one phone call SAM Nothing takes one phone call . LIZ We wo n't say a word , right Sam ? ( As BOB and JESSICA speak , their voices overlap . ) BOB It 's just that I had an odd experience driving home last night / I was driving along this road , it was very dark JESSICA I had a dream last night / BOB And I see this thing , this wolf or cat or something / I do n't know JESSICA Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop myself , I just have to go BOB An animal or cat , like a feline thing / and it 's running beside the car JESSICA Last night I dreamt I was running , and I looked down and saw two / front paws BOB And I get to a stop sign / JESSICA There 's something incredible stretching out that far / something a two-legged never feels p. 76 BOB So I slow down to a stop and it looks at me it was you / JESSICA I was running to get away from / something BOB I mean it was still an animal / but the face was yours JESSICA It was very real / I could feel it right down inside BOB When I start up the car / it runs alongside again JESSICA Then I ran across the road BOB Then it runs in front of me JESSICA Something big and black / with eyes that blinded me BOB And I hit the damn thing JESSICA I could feel myself being hit / I dragged myself off the road BOB I thought I 'd killed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much / I did n't understand BOB I ran out , and there was nothing there , not a thing gone , no blood nothing JESSICA When I woke up I had this .

LIZ Wow SAM This is my place , and you 've got no respect , so you 're getting thrown out p. 78 BOB ( To JESSICA . ) As they say in the business , the offer still stands . SAM As they say in the business , you are an asshole . ( JESSICA sways , as if she is going to pass out . ) Jesse , you okay ? JESSICA ( Disembodied . ) Sometimes I feel like I could kill you , not just you , but me and the kids too . I 'd like to use a knife , but maybe I 'd just give them sleeping pills mixed with milk . I 'd carry them into the kitchen watch them trying to breathe . Then maybe I 'd use a knife on them , or me , or a gun I would n't kill you , but I would kill you , because I 'd make sure you found us , lined up like that She 's standing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with no soul .

VITALINE There 's nothing fluffy about the Spirits . SAM There 's got to be action . p. 79 VITALINE That 's your job , you 're a man . SAM Then I 'm doing my job . VITALINE But you ca n't do your job unless the women are doing their job . SAM There 's nothing wrong with women .

WOLVERINE So many enemies , all to get back , track them down , get them back , make them pay , any way you can JESSICA Vitaline , you 've got to help me . SAM Look at her , you 're driving her out of her mind , she 'll be nuts again , just like when I found her . VITALINE Maybe , maybe not . SAM Are you trying to kill her ?

VITALINE And how do you feel when it 's dark ? ( WOLVERINE shadows JESSICA . ) WOLVERINE The wrong kind of power , useless egos going nowhere VITALINE ( To SAM . ) She 's got to get her dark side , so if you want to stick around , you 'd better sit tight .

SAM You want to divide us up , build a wall , and that 's how they get us every time . Everybody goes into their corners to get pissed off . We have to be on the same god-damn side . It 's men and women on the bottom against the Beast who 's going to push the button . And if we do n't fight that , there is n't going to be any praying to any spirits , dark side , light side , any side . VITALINE And what about the Beast ? Eh ? How did that Beast get born ? ( VITALINE waves her cane , in a full state of power . ) Thousands of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a crack opened up , a crack in the middle of an old lady 's ass . And from that crack came that Beast . ( WOLVERINE crawls to SAM . ) WOLVERINE And the Beast said to the Sun , " Are n't you tired of all those shadows and mysteries ? All those women running around in their underwear ? They 're laughing at you . You could crush them if you wanted . Would n't it be nice if there was only one kind of light ? " ( UNICORN moves to JESSICA. ) p. 84 UNICORN And the Beast said to the Moon , " Think of him , he needs you so much , you have so much to give Give in to him , after all , he is n't very bright . Hide your shining for a while . Hate him in secret . A little sacrifice , there 's so much glory in sacrifice .

SAM Does that mean you want me , or just anybody ? WOLVERINE It means any pair of arms will do . SAM You do n't love me , do you ? ( JESSICA , unable to speak , tries to focus on SAM . ) WOLVERINE How can a woman lost in shadows love anyone ?

JESSICA/WOLVERINE I want it . BOB You mean personally ? JESSICA/WOLVERINE Power is a commodity . Cream always rises to the top . Money is power . Idealists get bitter . Is n't that what you said ? BOB I do n't want to see you anymore . JESSICA/WOLVERINE You think I 've changed . BOB You 've learned too well . All that sexy idealism is gone . Now you 're just like me . JESSICA/WOLVERINE That 's right , and it 's all your fault . BOB But it 's been a bad deal . I 've risked my family , my standing in the community . What have you risked ? I 've taught you , but you have n't taught me anything . JESSICA/WOLVERINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain kinds of illusion , slightly more skilled than a two-bit tart giving blow jobs in a parking lot . As far as I can tell you have no real spiritual life , I do n't think you 'd know a spirit if you fell over one . p. 88 JESSICA/WOLVERINE Do n't say those things . BOB You 're an opportunist using the suffering of your people for personal gain . I 'm going to cut my losses now , and return to what has always been a very nice life . JESSICA/WOLVERINE ( The unbalanced WOLVERINE begins to take over . ) You want me to forget , you want me to ignore Are you sorry ? Please do n't be sorry . I ca n't hurt you , I have no guard Oh please protect me and give it to me , give it to be . They 're laughing at you , at the failure that you are . BOB I 'm not afraid of you . JESSICA/WOLVERINE You walk into the bank and your accounts are all empty . They do n't know who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . All lost , all lost . Your wife 's fucking your partner , they 're laughing at you , going through your precious things , all your money , all your power . All lost , the future failed , the past failed . Failure on your face , your fingers , failure on your cock , it wo n't rise , not ever again . No house , no clothes , no land , no car Your children are laughing at you , they hate weakness , it makes them sick . You try to walk with your head up , whimpering to yourself , hands shaking , smelling of the dead flesh , and shhhhshhhsttt ! On your face in the shit . With all your courage , you drag yourself to your feet , you think you 've gotten away with it and then haughhghghghhghsttt ! And when you rest , panting in the gutter , pissing yourself in fright , you find a final bid of strength , and slowly slowly crawl to your knees , back uncoiling , and at that moment , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BOB is down on the floor , and JESSICA 's hands are around his neck . He is choking , getting weaker . ) Nothing to trust . Your songless throat closes with no chance for a prayer , they 've been ripped from your chest , regret is like smoke , you breathe it in and it never goes away You 've stolen the breath from yourself , you 've stolen the breath from yourself ( JESSICA/WOLVERINE breaks away , remembering the ceremony . ) I 'm not standing in a fertile place , I 'm standing in a place that 's dry and empty , like a desert . ( VITALINE moves silently to the ceremony circle . BOB gets to his feet , gasping. ) p. 89 BOB You almost killed me Do n't sell me short . I saw my life pass before me Maybe you are worth it All this talk about visions I finally saw something . JESSICA/WOLVERINE What did you see ? BOB ( Softly . ) The Wolverine . ( VITALINE 's chant cuts the air . JESSICA is propelled toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ceremony returns full circle . JESSICA and VITALINE return to their positions at the beginning of the ceremony . ) VITALINE I humbly ask you to help her enter the circle in her own way . JESSICA It 's as if there 's a stone in there , and unless I let it loose , I 'm going to die . VITALINE Jesse ? Where 's Wolverine ? JESSICA Inside . ( WOLVERINE leaves the ceremony . ) CROW Where 's Crow ? ( JESSICA turns to CROW . They exchange a long look . CROW leaves the ceremony . ) VITALINE And Coyote ? JESSICA Vitaline ? ( VITALINE walks out of the circle. ) p. 90 BEAR How about Bear ? JESSICA Sam ? ( BEAR leaves the ceremony . ) UNICORN Where 's Unicorn , Jesse ? ( JESSICA pauses a moment , then opens her hands , palms up , and balances them . UNICORN leaves the ceremony . ) VITALINE What do you see ? JESSICA I do n't know . Someone made of smoke , maybe it 's a man , maybe it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we 've conjured her up , and she ca n't quite get through . VITALINE Who is she ? JESSICA I do n't want to look at her VITALINE Who is she ? Name her . JESSICA I feel like I 'm drowning VITALINE Keep breathing JESSICA She 's bigger than she should be , I do n't want her to be that big VITALINE Name her . JESSICA She does n't have a name . VITALINE What 's her name ? p. 91 JESSICA Nothing . VITALINE Grandmothers and Grandfathers , give me strength ! Call her now or you 'll never see her again . Name her . JESSICA Jessica ! ( JESSICA throws back her head . Small sounds escape from her throat . The sounds lengthen as she births them . Extending and weaving , a melody emerges , searching for a peak . Her song bursts through , triumphant.Blackout . The end. )                                 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
