The chimney stacks along the St. Nicolaas beach on Aruba no longer belch smoke into the luminous tropical air . After 60 years of refining more than 6.5 billion bbl. of crude , including 1 out of every 16 bbl. of aircraft fuel used by Allied forces in World War II , Exxon 's Lago refinery , once the largest in the world , will shut down this week . The closing marks the end of an era in the world oil industry and spells trouble for the 70-sq. - mi . Caribbean island . The refinery has provided Aruba with more than half its annual income for better than two generations . Writes the Curacao-based Antillen Review : " The chilling truth , that a total economic collapse might well be the country 's fate within two years , has at last dawned upon a wide spectrum of the nation 's decision makers . " <P> The bleak oil-refinery situation is not limited to Aruba . The Caribbean 's eight major refineries are cutting production , and more than 100 U.S. refineries have ceased operating since 1981 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65,000-bbl. - a- day plant in Lawrenceville , Ill. , and a 20,000-bbl. - a- day operation in Amarillo , Texas . Since September , the company has halved the capacity of its Port Arthur , Texas , refinery to 200,000 bbl. a day . <P> The effects of the closings have been felt most acutely in the Texas Golden Triangle near Beaumont at the heart of the Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical industry . Since 1981 the area has suffered a 30% decrease in its oil-refinery work force  --  a loss of 4,000 jobs . Employment in the region 's petrochemical industry is down 16% , or 1,749 workers . Offshore-services employment is off 69%  --  2,124 jobs . Says Debbie Brown , executive director of Orange Christian Services , a Gulf Coast community-support organization : " About two years ago , we saw 40 to 50 families a month in need of emergency assistance . Today we have jumped to 40 or 50 a day . " <P> Even as American refineries have been closing , imports of petroleum products into the U.S. have been steadily increasing . The Energy Information Administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including fuel oil , finished gasoline and gasoline-blending components , have risen about 24% during the past four years . The amount of gasoline entering the U.S. market from abroad nearly doubled during that period , to 291,000 bbl. a day in 1984 , while imports of oil requiring further processing increased more than 50% , to an average 230,000 bbl. daily . <P> Part of the reason for the glut of oilrefining capacity was the industry 's over-optimistic assessment of world demand for energy products . Total U.S. consumption of petroleum products rose only 4% last year after a five-year decline . In addition , Western refineries face increasing competition from oil- producing countries , which now refine their own crude at home . Between 1984 and 1988 , Saudi Arabia , Mexico , Kuwait , Libya and other oil countries will add about 3 million bbl. a day to their refining capacity .
