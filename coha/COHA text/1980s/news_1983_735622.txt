txt War is about to break out on the commercial air lanes of the north Pacific . On April 2 , United Airlines , which flies more miles than any other commercial airline , will start daily flights between Chicago and Tokyo . The day before . Japan Air Lines , one of the world 's largest carriers , will start service three times a week between the two cities . Overnight , capacity on the ChicagoTokyo route will more than double . United plans to add daily service between New York and Hong Kong on May 28 , and hopes eventually to fly to other cities in the Orient . JAL may soon increase its ChicagoTokyo flights to five days a week . And other major U.S. and Asian airlines are said to be considering service between the Orient and the U.S. , if they can get permission . For travelers , the new battle will bring better service and probably , in time , lower fares . For Pacific carriers , though , it may mean less profit . And for Northwest Airlines in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a direct challenge for its turf . Northwest has been flying across the Pacific for 35 years . Good Growth Prospects " It looks like the big battle will be United vs . Northwest , and I think they 'll hurt each other , " says Kozo Takino , Midwest manager for JAL . The maneuvering reflects the conviction of airlines that trans-Pacific routes offer better than average prospects for traffic growth  --  far better than the crowded transAtlantic routes . Japan is the crucial spot , with 65% or so of all trans-Pacific service touching down in that country . United tried for 16 years to get into Japan . It took tough negotiations in 1980 and 1981 between U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators to finally reach an interim three-year agreement to expand service between the two countries . JAL won the right to fly to Chicago as part of the deal . The Pacific venture is United 's first big foray outside the U.S. , and it is a costly gamble . The airline , a unit of UAL Inc. , has pumped millions into getting ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply in the red . " We think the Pacific offers the best potential in the world , but we know it is n't going to be easy , " says Donald C. Moonjian , vice president for market management . He estimates it will be a year and half before United breaks even on Pacific service . But within a few years , he says , United could reach $250 million in revenue on the Pacific routes . Its total volume exceeded $4 billion last year . The Tokyo service presents special obsta- cles for United . The airline is n't nearly as well known in Japan as in the U.S. It even flubbed an early public-relations campaign by publishing maps of Japan that left out the northernmost island of Hokkaido . Getting acceptance in Japan is critical because 60% of Japan-U.S. air travel originates in Japan . So United 's ad spending for the new service is nearly three times more in Japan than the U.S. United retained Dentsu , the large Japanese ad agency , to help create a promotional campaign there . United also is struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . United hopes eventually to be the dominant carrier in the Pacific , and some airline executives figure it has a chance in the long " We think the Pacific offers the best potential in the world , but we know it is n't going to be easy , " a United vice president says . run . An executive of an airline with Pacific routes says he is impressed that United is starting out with a large number of flights , and he thinks United 's large domestic network will help feed traffic to its Pacific routes . Northwest officials sniff at the suggestion that they face formidable competition on Pacific routes . They say the airline is well established with more flights-47 a day , up from 43 a year ago  --  convenient schedules and non-stop flights . United 's Chicago-Tokyo flights will stop in Seattle or Portland . and its Hong Kong-New York flights and JAL 's Chicago-Tokyo flights will stop in Seattle . Still . Northwest is preparing for a fight . Its trans-Pacific territory has been lucrative , providing $500 million a year in revenue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , it is extending its daily New York-Tokyo non-stop flights to Hong Kong . meeting United 's planned service . It is initiating twice-weekly service between Chicago and Seoul , South Korea , a logical future leg for United . Northwest now lets participants in its frequent-flier program count the long Pacific flights in their mileage totals  --  double credits , in fact , for full-fare passengers . And Northwest says it will introduce new flight amenities on April 1 . Travel agents figure Northwest 's service could stand a little improvement , from handling reservations to caring for passengers in flight . In their advertising , United and JAL extol the niceties they have in store for passengers , including lavish food and an onboard language interpreter . Japan Blocks Discount Fares Both United and JAL say advance bookings for the new services are good , but they wo n't disclose figures . JAL officials say they are counting heavily on their entrenched position in Japan to help them . But JAL is also selling hard in the U.S. , putting many of its 300 U.S. sales representatives at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount fare between Chicago and Tokyo , but was blocked by the Japanese government , which has tried in recent years to protect JAL from fare-cutting . Some carriers have circumvented Japanese authorities by charging less for flights with a stopover in Japan . Though unauthorized , some passengers simply cut their trip short by leaving the plane in Tokyo . In any event , airline executives and travel consultants say a surge of new service on trans-Pacific routes will eventually bring more discounting . Regular travelers seem uncertain about all the new service . James F. Bere , chairman and chief executive of Borg-Warner Corp. , Chicago , says he 'll probably try United and JAL to see if he likes the service . He says he appreciates Northwest 's non-stop service between Chicago and Tokyo , but until recently has n't been impressed with Northwest  --  lax service , dirty carpets and the like , he says . " They seem to have improved the service maybe in anticipation of competition . " he says . An Inland Steel executive says lie will try United 's service to Tokyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the service was indifferent and the food was mediocre " Takashi Nagata , staff director of Japanese operations at Motorola Inc. , in Schaumberg , Ill. , flies three or four tunes a year to Tokyo , usually by Northwest . " I 'll try United and JAL to see how good they are , " says Mr. Nagata . But Harry S. Roth , administration manager at Brunswick Corp. , Skokie . III. , who supervises travel for his company , thinks United will have a rough time cutting into Northwest 's non-stop traffic .
