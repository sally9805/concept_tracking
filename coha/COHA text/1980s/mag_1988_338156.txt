Doctors have long suspected that the heart could heal itself even when damaged by a heart attack or during surgery  --  if only there were a way to let it rest . For more than 20 years , researchers have been trying to develop implantable pumps that temporarily take over part of the heart 's job . Some half a dozen such devices are now available , most of them experimental , bulky and requiring risky open-heart surgery . But at a medical conference last week in Reno , O. Howard Frazier , director of the transplant program at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston , described the first successful use of a radically different newcomer . It is a tiny , disposable pump that can handle most of the heart 's workload and that can be inserted in 20 minutes without major surgery . <P> Frazier first tried the device last month on a patient who was near death after a heart transplant . Working from an incision in the patient 's groin , the surgeon threaded a 7-in. assembly made of a tube connected to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his left ventricle , the main pumping chamber of the heart . The stainless-steel pump , driven by a slender cable linked to a motor outside the body , took on the work of the ailing ventricle . Spinning 25,000 times a minute  --  about four times as fast as a sports-car engine  --  the pump drew a steady stream of blood out of the chamber and into the aorta , the main vessel carrying blood to the body . Afterward , Frazier exulted , " This is really an astonishing device . " <P> Within days , the patient 's condition improved , and his transplanted heart began to beat strongly on its own . The dramatic case marked the debut of the Hemopump , an experimental device just 1/4 in. wide and 1/2 in. long , manufactured by Nimbus Medical Inc. , of Rancho Cordova , Calif . Although a second patient given the pump died , the cause was apparently unrelated to the device . <P> Allan Lansing , director of Humana Heart Institute International in Louisville , expects to begin further tests soon on the Hemopump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Drug Administration last March . " I 'm impressed , " says Lansing . " If this pump does work , it could be of enormous benefit to many patients . " Eventually , he says , it could be available in coronary-care units and emergency rooms to treat heart attacks immediately after they occur . " It wo n't replace anything that is now available , " says Heart Surgeon Jack Copeland of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center in Tucson . " But it will add a dimension to what we can do for patients . " <P> The pump 's inventor , Richard Wampler , 39 , a California physician , took his inspiration from pumps he saw in deep wells ten years ago in Egypt . The pump 's spinning motion and the resulting continuous flow of blood from the heart represent a departure from the natural pulsating action that most other devices try to mimic . Some researchers at first feared that the whirling blades would destroy blood cells and that the body would be unable to tolerate the nonpulsating blood flow . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawback : small as the pump is , it may be too large to use in women and children or in patients with narrowed arteries .
