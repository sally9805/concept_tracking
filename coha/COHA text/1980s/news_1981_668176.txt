Cross-country skiing is a sport for those who want more from winter than sliding downhill and waiting in line to be towed back up again for another schuss . Cross-country requires a little more strength and endurance , but it ' s probably safer and for the outdoors lover there ' s nothing more exciting than skiing through snow- covered forests in relative solitude . Lousteau knows of what he writes , he himself is an enthusiastic cross- country skier and has been in the ski equipment business in New England for the past six years . His guide is full of information about trails and terrains , the availability of lessons , rentals and specialties . The guide cites 121 different ski touring sites in five states ( nothingfrom Rhode Island ) . Accommodations at the touring centers range from relatively modest sites with snack bars , such as those in Lynn and Lincoln , Mass. , to the Cortina Inn in Killington , Vt. , where you may dawdle in a heated swimming pool and get a massage . The trails go from 80 miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the centers border on national forests or parks where there ' s even more room i. e. if you tire of the 62 miles of trail in Bretton Woods , N. H. , you can swing over into the White Mountain National Forest . Some of the centers feature multi-day hikes with lodges along the way . And there ' s one spot in Maine where either you have to fly in or ski in.BOSTON ' S WORKERS : A Labor HistoryBy James R. Green and Hugh C. Donahue . Boston Public Library . 134 pp. $0000 This is a useful condensation of the underside of Boston history , the hard and always painful struggle of working people to better themselves and their working conditions . The authors do a journeyman job covering the city ' s history starting with the colonial days of 1747 when merchant seamen rioted in Dock Square protesting the English press gangs which abducted sailors off the street and forced them to work on foul English ships under brutal masters . The practice stopped for a while but a government report on the riots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Servants , Negroes and Other Persons of Mean and Vile Condition . " The report was written by Thomas Hutchinson , whose mansion in the North End was sacked by protesters in 1765 . Hutchinson ' s condemnation of foreigners and radicals and the angry militants were themes which were to be repeated again and again during the class struggles which played a crucial role in shaping the city and continue to do so . Much of the energy of the labor movement in the early 1800s was consumed in agitation for the 10-hour day . Workers in the mills and the shipyards normally put in 13 hours , some longer , especially in the summer when shipyard hours went from sunup to sunrise . Employers resisted the change , condemned efforts of the workers to organize and got help from always complacent politicians . The 10-hour day was defeated in 1832 , and again two years later . Then the immigration of impoverished Irish workers started in the mid- ' 30s creating a pool of cheap labor for local industrialists , and labor reform was dead , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War with strikes in 1866 and ' 67 . George McNeill , an officer in the ill- fated Knights of Labor , helped found the Boston Eight Hour League in 1864 , one of the first in the country , and the issue was a cornerstone of labor agitation although it took another 50 years to get the shorter day ( as late as 1909 Gov . Draper vetoed an eight- hour-day bill . ) The labor movement had other moments in the Hub , but it never achieved the goals that became common elsewhere . It was the Boston political system allied with the old-line business interests which the authors see as the reasons for the conservatism of organized labor in the city today . In broad strokes the authors show that Democratic political bosses , epitomized by James Michael Curley , and conservative union officials , like international Teamsters President Dan Tobin of Cambridge or the Hodcarriers ' Dominic D ' Alessandro of the North End , were co-opted by the system and sold short the working people who depended on them and who gave them their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the women ' s attempt to organize - there were a number of national figures who came out of Boston such as Mabel Gillespie , Mary Kenney O ' Sullivan and Florence Luscom . There ' s a survey of the police strike of 1919 where AFL president Samuel Gompers is charged with selling out the Boston policemen and city leaders are accused of manipulating public opinion against the strikers . There ' s also a dandy bibliography which will remind you that a lot of the book ' s material has been presented in greater depth by other historians . But nowhere else has this valuable story been told so well and so concisely . One complaint , the binding of the book is second-rate , or third.TO MARKET , TO MARKET : Six Walking Tours of the Old and the New BostonBy Corrine Madden Ross . Illustrations by Jean Segaloff . Charles River Books . 87 pp. $4.95 . Boston ' s new waterfront is covered here in a chatty and knowledgable manner . There is a brief history of the Faneuil Hall Marketplace and the Quincy Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking tours of the nearby North End and Charlestown and the JFK Library in Dorchester . Ross writes engagingly about the past history of the areas - most of which should be well known to local history buffs - but the book ' s strength lies in what ' s current , such as the Children ' s Museum and the Museum of Transportation ; the Tea Party Trail and the replica of one of the original Tea Party ships ; the Walkway to the Sea ; the new City Hall and Plaza , the construction of which took 2.4 million bricks . There is also a mention of stores and restaurants , of when historic houses are open and the prices . The drawings by Segaloff are sprightly and capture the character of the new and the old.QUIET PRESENCE : A History of Franco Americans in New EnglandBy Dyke Hendrickson . Guy Gannett Publishing , Portland , Maine . 266 pp. $6.95 ( paper ) . By 1875 an alarmed Canadian government offered bargain basement land values to the French-Canadians who had moved south into New England in the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only did the immigrants stay put but hundreds of thousands more eventually streamed south . By 1900 there were some 537,000 French-Canadians in New England , 275,000 in Massachusetts . They provided the willing muscle and sweat which powered the textile and leathermills . The French-Canadians were favored by the mill owners , who sent agents into Quebec to recruit them . An 1890 report of the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the owners favored French-Candian millhands because " they are industrious in the extreme , do not grumble about pay , are docile , and have nothing to do with labor agitations . " Hendrickson ' s enlightening book sketches the history of these people and their almost excruciatingly slow assimilation into the American mainstream . Battered by a society where the language was strange and the religion was alien and hostile they tended to cling together in mill towns for mutual aid and support . They had their own priests ( but not bishops ) , their own schools and clubs , and their own extended family units to protect them and to keep them isolated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lewiston , Manchester and Woonsockett , although they were not allowed to make much of a splash in the intellectual or political life of these communities . And they are still under-represented in the power structure . There are more than 2 million persons of French-Canadian descent in New England today with significant numbers in Maine and New Hampshire and Rhode Island , but none anywhere at the highest political levels . But , as Hendrickson points out , Americans with a French-Canadian background are breaking out of their cultural ghettos and the ghetto mentality . The number of French-language schools have dwindled and more young people aspire to and are entering professions . There has even been a backlash of sorts with some community leaders worried about the loss of a Franco identity . Hendrickson is an editor of the Sunday Telegram in Portland and his book grew out of a series of feature articles . More than half of the book is devoted to interviews with 29 representative Franco- Americans , 18 of them from Maine . They are the strongest part of the book .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
