The little book contains no names , not even that of its owner , though there is evidence that he had some connection with Vitebsk , in Byelorussia , and had served with Soviet forces in Hungary . He was a dead Soviet paratrooper , whose personal journal had fallen into the hands of anti-Soviet Afghans . <P> The notebook included colored pen sketches and , most poignantly , several touching poems-a parachutist reflecting on the ever present nearness of death . The following translations , made from a photocopy of the notebook , are the work of TIME Staff Writer David Aikman and Reporter-Researcher John Kohan : <P> <P> I AM GOING AWAY <P> I am going away , said the lad to <P> her through his grief , Not for a long time . Wait for me and I will <P> return . <P> He went off , never met up with His first spring . He came home In a soldier 's metal coffin . <P> He did not live beyond the hour <P> before dawn . <P> He fell on his chest and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on his chest not during war but in peace , When spring ignites the stars of love for us . <P> <P> Mother sobs and father Stands like a shadow . For them he was just a very young man . <P> And how many of them , who have <P> not <P> Yet made the first step in life Have come home in a soldier 's <P> metal coffin ? <P> And once , when he went walking <P> with his girl , He gave her flowers And played a song for her on his <P> guitar , And even in the instant when the snow grew stale , when the thaw came , <P> He wrote down in blood the name of that little girl . <P> The wind scattered the flurrying <P> snow above the grave . <P> That girl has gone off with <P> another lad , That girl who promised , " I will <P> wait . " <P> The snow has thawed , the name <P> has disappeared with it . <P> <P> THE JUMP <P> The parachutist stands in the <P> doorway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages and the forests . <P> There goes the siren and the <P> flashing of the green light . <P> The " Jump ! " signal light is for <P> you And already as if embraced by <P> storms , You are flying violently to the <P> ground <P> Coming up to meet you . Through your tears you see the <P> butt of your rifle And canopies like white <P> flowers . <P> The canopy has opened up behind <P> the shroudlines . <P> The ground below is in a fog But over it , <P> It 's as if you suddenly take in Half of Europe at a glance .
