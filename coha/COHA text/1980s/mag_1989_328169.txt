Like George Bush and thousands of other people , I am a Small White Hunter . - Which means that , two or three times a year , one scrambles into one 's brush pants and jacket , pulls on a pair of snake boots and goes ambling off on a sedate horse with friends and dogs in pursuit of quail in a pine forest in southern Georgia . Or spends cold predawn hours in a punt on Long Island Sound , or a damp blind on a California marsh , waiting for the gray light to spread and the ducks to come arrowing in . <P> I have done this at intervals most of my life , ever since I was eleven years old in Australia and my father first issued me a single-shot .22 and two bullets and told me to bring back one rabbit . I hope to keep doing it as long as I can walk and see . <P> I do n't shoot deer anymore ; the idea of large-game trophy hunting repels me . But I have never thought there was anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I and a few friends could eat in the evening  --  no more than that and always within the limits . On a good day I can break 24 targets out of 25 at trapshooting , and 22 or so at skeet , which is O.K. for an art critic . <P> In short , I am supposed  --  if you believe the advertisements of the National Rifle Association  --  to be exactly the kind of person whose rights the N.R.A . claims to want to protect . Why , then , have I never joined the N.R.A. ? And why do I think of this once omnipotent though now embattled lobby as the sportsman 's embarrassment and not his ally ? <P> The answer , in part , goes back to the famous Second Amendment of the American Constitution , which the N.R.A . keeps brandishing like Holy Writ . " A well-regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , " it reads , " the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . " <P> The part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first half is less convenient because it undermines the lobby 's propaganda for universal weaponry . <P> The Founding Fathers , in their wisdom  --  and more pointedly , their experience  --  distrusted standing armies . They associated British ones with tyranny and lacked the money and manpower to create their own . Without a citizens ' militia , the Revolution would have failed . Does the Constitution let you have the second half of the Second Amendment , the right to keep and bear arms , without the first part , the intended use of those arms in the exercises and , when necessary , the campaigns of a citizens ' militia to which the gun owner belongs  --  as in Switzerland today ? That is still very much a subject for legal debate . <P> &; The constitutional framers no more had in mind the socially psychotic prospect of every Tom , Dick and Harriet with a barnful of MAC-10s , Saturday night specials and AK-47s than , in writing the First Amendment , they had in mind the protection of child-porn video , which did not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the right to bear arms means the right to bear any or all arms . Which arms is the real issue . At present , firepower has outstripped the law 's power to contain it within rational limits .
