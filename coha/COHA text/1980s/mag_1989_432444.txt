 | What 's your fashion fantasy ? Want to go hunting with the British aristocracy ? Try on Ralph Lauren . Dream of being a successful female executive ? Reach for Donna Karan . Fancy the beautifully buffed Italian look ? Buy an Armani . Is the real you sophisticated and artistic ? Yves Saint Laurent , of course . How about young , witty , American ? Uh ... not so sure anymore ? Time was , Perry Ellis would have leapt to mind . But since the designer 's death two years ago the Ellis message has n't been so clear . So how to infuse the Ellis name with new life ? In a recent move that wowed Seventh Avenue , the Perry Ellis Sportswear company bet its future on a relative child , 25-year-old designer Marc Jacobs . The new kid has his work cut out for him . As Ellis knew best , fashion designers do n't just create clothes ; they shape lifestyles and sell fantasies . It 's a business in which the cult counts as much as the cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death ( the official cause was viral encephalitis , presumably from AIDS ) , response to his successor , Patricia Pastor , was not always warm . " Perry Ellis had enormous charisma , " says Marjorie Deane , publisher of the Tobe Report , an upscale fashion-merchandising publication . " When he was gone , the line had to be even better . But each season they did something different . They were losing that special look . " The unenthusiastic reviews led to lower sales for the designer collections and less floor space in stores . Enter Marc Jacobs . Already a proven success with his own designs , he seems the answer to the company 's dreams . Certainly no one has trained more assiduously to follow in the footsteps of the master . " Perry Ellis was one of my heroes , " says Jacobs , who wears his hair in a ponytail , as Ellis did in his youth . " He told me to go to Parsons School of Design . So I did . " The Salant Corp. , parent company of Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as Karl Lagerfeld did Chanel . " We want a recognizable image ? but that does n't mean I 'm asking Marc to copy the past , " says Nick DiPaolo , president of Salant . Jacobs has a vision of what Perry Ellis should be . " Yves Saint Laurent is for the woman who likes Braque paintings and is rich enough to own them . Now she wants to wear them out to dinner , " Jacobs says . " Perry Ellis is for the woman who is more earthy ? she may be dressed for dinner , but she 's not too uptight to sit on the floor . " Name strength : Though Jacobs may need to refocus the company profile , things could be worse . In the last two years annual revenues from the Perry Ellis Sportswear division have increased by about 20 percent , to $100 million a year ? even while the company 's reputation as a top designer has been taking a nose dive . The reason is simple : the company made a concerted effort to appeal to the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer does not turn a profit on his top-of-the-line clothing ; he makes his money by lending his logo to mass-market licensees of perfume , shoes and other accessories . Before his death , Perry Ellis made millions on the strength of his name alone , but his sportswear company ? which emphasized his high-priced designer collection ? was never in the black . It 's doing better now because it has expanded its mass-market " America " line and introduced a line of men 's dress shirts . Still , if the company hopes to make money over the long term , it has to regain its image as a fashion force . " We have to get back to being considered a topdesigner firm , " says DiPaolo . " If not , con- fidence is lost . " So far retailers are enthusiastic about Jacobs . " Marc has much of the spirit once known as the Perry Ellis spirit , " says Saks Fifth Avenue 's fashion director , Ellin Saltzman . Jacobs 's first professional honor was the Perry Ellis Gold Thimble award four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council of Fashion Designers of America . But his own line was more saucy than Ellis 's ; he had one dress he called a " Freudian slip " that he emblazoned with a full-faced portrait of Sigmund Freud . " I might design a classic blazer , " he says , " but then make it in bubble-gum pink . " Explains Bernie Ozer , of the Associated Merchandising Corp. : " His presentation was kind of fast-lane and flippy . But he had to gain attention . Now , with a big organization , he will have the space to explode his talent . " Jacobs is already at work on his fall 1989 line , which will be presented this spring . One of his ideas is to revive the afghanblanket look of the 1960s . A preliminary sketch shows a lavish fringed cashmere shawl in wide , bright stripes . For now , though , Jacobs is n't talking much about specific designs . " Perry was n't about silhouette , " Jacobs says . " He was about spirit . " Is he nervous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he insists . " Scared to death . "
