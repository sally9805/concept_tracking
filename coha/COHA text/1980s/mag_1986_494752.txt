Angela Carter , throwing her voice back over the centuries , displays the talents of a skilled ventriloquist ? with one important difference : Carter wants us to see her lips move . In this collection of short stories , her third , she takes apart the accepted morality tales that constitute the sacred cow called History , and exposes , through her own manipulation of them , the cultural conventions that shape our view of the past . She begins with " The Fall River Axe Murders , " a riveting psychological portrait of Lizzie Borden that draws on the textbook determinism of novels like Wharton 's Ethan Frame . Descended from " the industrious , self-mortifying saints who imported the Protestant ethic wholesale into a land intended for the siesta , " a land where " summer and salmonella came in together , " Lizzie is doomed from the start . Born in post-Edenic Massachusetts ( her town is called Fail River ) and christened by her father with a " diminutive " ? " a miser in everything , he even cropped off half her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slides passively towardthose without novelistic ambitions , their feet firmly planted in the Chekhovian short-story tradition . Why iconography : On this burning morning when , after breakfast and the performance of a few household duties , Lizzie Borden will murder her parents , she will , on rising , don a simple cotton frock that , if worn by itself , might he right for the weather . But , underneath , has gone a long , starched cotton petticoat ; another starched petticoat , a short one ; long drawers ; woolen stockings ; a chemise ; and a whalebone corset that takes her viscera in an unkind hand and squeezes them very tightly . There is also a heavy linen napkin strapped between her legs because she is menstruating . In all these clothes , out of sorts and nauseous as she is , in this dementing heat , her belly in a vice , she will heat up a flatiron on a stove and press handkerchiefs with the heated iron .... But the social and physical actualities of Lizzie 's time and place account for only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that consigns Lizzie to a " fictive , protracted childhood " ? and to which any life , given the right storyteller , could logically be reduced ? is offered as yet another explanation of the parricidal crime toward which Lizzie 's history builds . When she is two her mother dies , making room for an archetypally wicked stepmother ? a gluttonous parasite who grows ever more obese as she nibbles away at the family 's emotional and financial resources , to the point of driving her husband to chop off the heads of Lizzie 's prized pigeons because she " fancies " them for a pie . Add to these sociopolitical , psychoanalytical reductions of the Borden tragedy Carter 's own condensation of Lizzie 's tale and you have the final gloss on a multilayered fiction . For Carter 's tale is the product of a fictive " memory , " and memory , by its very nature , is selective and imperfect . E ARLY ON , Carter sets the stage for the narrative acrobatics to come , by turning the genre of " The House That Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information bit by bit to a skeletal outline , Carter strips her story down , in full view of the reader , to what she considers its bare emblematic bones , and then steps back to highlight her distortion of historical truth : In a mean house on Second Street ... five living creatures are sleeping in the still , warm early morning . The other old man is some kind of kin of Borden 's . He does n't belong here ; he is a chance bystander , he is irrelevant . Write him out of the script . Ow old man and three of his women sleep in the house on Second Street . Yet despite the fiction writer/historian 's attempts to define Lizzie Borden for all time , to provide the Ur-reading of her life story , Lizzie remains " a stranger to herself , " unable to distinguish in any of the " distorting mirrors " with which her tale is filled ( " no mirror in this house does not take your face and twist it out of shape for you " ) the real Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borden house , she quite pointedly does n't show us the interior of Lizzie 's room . That " yet other door " is " kept securely locked , " enabling Carter to clean the historical slate and bring us , in the final sentence of her story , to the pre-symbolic , prehistoric instant when " the Bordens 's fatal day trembles on the brink of beginning . " These twice and thrice told tales ( a genre in which Carter has dabbled for years ) all begin with a literary fait accompli hermetically sealed by historical " fact . " In other words , not only are they about the fallen world , but they call into question the very notion of an objective , retrievable history unclouded by legend . Carter supplies the missing prologues to these sanctified stories ? some of which we learn by rote in grade school ? and crafts a " brave new world " of strangers out of a long since colonized past . Returning to the peaceable kingdom of history where Brits befriend Indians and children in baptismal gowns romp unharmed amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorns the book 's cover ? Carter stirs up this settled and sainted fiction , and in the process pits life against art , brother against brother , self against self . Having shown us , in " The Fall River Axe Murders , " the multiplicity of readings ( and tellings ) that fit any historical event , Carter hones in on the particular axes she wishes to grind . " Our Lady of the Massacre , " for instance , unmasks the ethnocentricity that 's responsible for so much of the fiction of Early American history . It is the story of a " Lancashire milkmaid " become petty thief and whore who travels by way of Newgate prison to Virginia , there to live among the Indians , most of whom are soon massacred by the British . At the opening of the story , this nameless young woman 's future is foretold by her Old World benefactress ( the quintessential myopic historian ) using a zodiacal chart and knowledge of the stars obtained through " a great telescope " left the old woman by her father : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ... what she did not see , she made up , for she said she had poor sight for the things of this world but clear sight into the one to come . " The old woman prophesies that once in Virginia , whose " rivers flow directly from Eden , " her precious charge will be " nowt less than Our Lady of the Red Men . " She will bear a " blessed babe whose fathers ' fathers never sailed in Noah 's Ark " and will convert the natives to the " true religion . " Her child will sit " smiling over everything with a gold crown on his head . " In short , the American myth of manifest destiny . But it is n't the way things happened . For " although the Minister would have it otherwise , " the blasphemous intruders on this native ground were not , of course , the Indians , and no amount of Christian prophecy can smooth over the annihilation of a race . Carter 's repentant harlot , who at the very end of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , repents not of her errant life among the " savages , " but of the impulse toward thieving and prostitution with which her mother country has tainted her : For all the Minister swears they 've come to build the City of God in the New World , 1 was the same skivvy as I 'd been in Lancashire and no openings for a whore in the Community of Saints , either , if I could have found in my heart the least desire to take up my old trade again . But I could not ; the Indians had damned me for a good woman once and for all . " Our Lady of the Massacre " is more , however , than a sentimental treatise in reverse . Carter injects the moral seriousness of her authentic first-person narrative with a broad , ironic humor . Early on , having escaped from a sexually abusive overseer , Carter 's heroine meets her first " red " woman ( " not red but wondrous brown , " weaponless and picking herbs ) , who asks her in sign language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " ' Now I 'm for it ! ' I thinks but hands it over and she smiles , though not much , for these savages are not half so free with their feelings as we are . . " Behind this naive backhandedness lurks a harsh reality , for it is the colonists who transform " Our Lady of the Red Men " into " Our Lady of the Massacre " ? leaving " a fair garden blasted of folk , " a river " running blood , " and a half-breed child who bears the mark of Cain surveying the ruins with a crown " of tears " rather than of gold . At the end of her narrative " Our Lady " weeps " by the waters of Babylon , " but the Zion she remembers is the now conquered territory of a heathen tribe , not her " Christian " homeland in Merry Old England . The saints of history 's parables , Carter exhorts , appear ? by virtue of history 's protective veil ? to be strangers to the realities of imperialism and fratricide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carter takes this war of fiction versus reality inside the psyche . She chronicles the decay of experience into theater , and of history ( through the reflexive quality of her prose ) into literary clich ? . Imitating the structure and style of the classic German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ( 1920 ) , as well as the work of Edgar Allan Poe , Carter allies the filmic dissolve of truth into fiction with the chiaroscuro of democracy and tyranny , the revolving janus of freedom and repression . Poe , who has grown up " under the blackstars of the slave states , " is transported to the " austere morning " of the Republic where " stern , democratic light scrubs apparitions off the streets " and " a man must make his own penumbra if he wants concealment . " In this setting that " admits of no ambiguities , " and in the simplistic categories of historical legend , " Either you are a saint or a stranger . " But as the lights dim on Carter 's Gothic tale and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more difficult to tell the strangers from the saints . The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , from which Carter borrows here , centers on the relationship between two characters whose uncertain identities are the crux of the film . Francis is either a criminal who has performed murders for a showman at a local fair or a delusive and unreliable narrator in the process of being cured ; Caligari is either a manipulative tyrant committing murders-by-proxy or a benevolent healer . Carter 's " Cabinet " ends with Poe , within whom both these figures are contained , staring into a " reflective glass " ( after shaving off his moustache ) at features that are " his own and yet not his own . " Instead of what he believes to be his reverse image , Poe sees his wife , Virginia , " the loved and lost one " whom he may or may not have killed . The specter of this imagined offense haunts him , as does his native loyalty to the " slave state " whose name she shares . Unable to reconcile his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a whole , democratic self , Poe surrealistically disintegrates as he stands at the mirror , engulfed by the shadow of past crimes ? even as he calls melodramatically for " Lights ! " The parody of Whitman 's ebullient " Song of Myself " that helps to introduce this tale , then , goes to the heart of Carter 's protect : " So you say he overacts ? Very well ; he overacts . There is a past history of histrionics in his family . " IT IS THE interaction between history 1 . and histrionics , between life and art , that most fascinates Carter . The literary models that stand behind her retellings of historical legends ? Ethan Frome behind " The Fall River Axe Murders , " Moll Flanders behind " Our Lady of the Massacre , " Caligari behind " The Cabinet of Edgar Allan Poe " ? heighten our sense that what Carter herself is doing , as she reopens the closed books of history , is fiction , indeed can not help but be fiction . But then so is history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection ? although these , too , are impressive ? Carter retraces the steps of her precursors , and daringly breaks new ground . " The Kiss , " a story told , as its narrator claims , " in simple , geometric shapes and the bold colors of a child 's box of crayons , " romanticizes the unfulfilled dreams of Uzbek peasant women after the Russian Revolution . " Peter and the Wolf " revises the well-known symphonic folk tale as a young man 's confrontation with his long-lost sister who grew up among the wolves in a pre-Fall wilderness . " Overture and Incidental Music for A Midsummer Night 's Dream " recasts Shakespeare 's play as " a midsummer 's nightmare " ? based on a feminist reading that disowns the 19th-century Mendelssohnian nostalgia that disinfected Shakespeare 's wood , ' ' cleansing it of the grave , hideous and elemental beings with which the superstition of an earlier age had tilled it , " and turned the play into an ethereal fairy tale . The penultimate tale , " The Kitchen Child , " pieces together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searches for the mysterious stranger who sired him ? and then disappeared while his mother ( the head cook in an Edwardian kitchen ) was busy with a lobster souffle . The last piece in the collection , " Black Venus , " provides the perfect finish for Saints and Strangers . It revolves around Jeanne Duval , Charles Baudelaire 's syphilitic Caribbean Creole mistress ? the agent , so the story goes , of a " raped continent 's revenge , perpetrating itself in the beds of Europe . " But according to Carter 's account , which is a play on the myth of the Fall , the reverse is true : it was Baudelaire , or the culture he epitomized , that gave Duval the disease . She " picked up the germ , " as all of Carter 's wronged heroines pick up their life sentences , " from the very first protector " ? whether a historically specific colonialism or a more pervasive , insidious chauvinism . For Carter 's purposes , then , Duval , as the sum total of all the pod / bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transpositions of Saints and Strangers : " She bent over backwards until the huge fleece of a black sheep , her unfastened hair , spilled on to the Bokhara .... She arched her back so much a small boy could have run under her . Her reversed blood sang in her ears . " Angela Carter 's agenda is to let down the hair of our received histories , to unfasten it pin by pin and coax its black sheep out of hiding , to shake out the strands of sexism , racism , and classism that have been woven into it . These virtuosic tales that make strangers of saints and saints of strangers stretch backward beyond the traditional bounds of fiction toward a searing home truth that would emancipate the present ? the small boy who runs through the hoop linking the old world and the new .
