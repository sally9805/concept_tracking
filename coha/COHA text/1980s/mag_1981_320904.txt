Farms for protein and profit <P> Shrimp boats is a-comin ' , <P> Their sails are in sight . <P> Shrimp boats is a-comin ' , <P> There 's dancin ' tonight . <P> - From a 1950s song <P> There is shrimp-inspired dancing in Ecuador these days all right , but it is not to the tune of returning boats . Instead , in vast ponds on the salty flatlands of El Oro and other coastal provinces , a new industry has sprung up : shrimp farming . Last year these farms produced 20.8 million lbs . of the tasty crustaceans , vs. nothing just a decade ago , earning $66 million in foreign exchange and hefty profits for Ecuador 's new shrimp farmers . <P> Chief among the new shrimpers is Peter Shayne , 46 , a Los Angeles native . Shayne set up a sea urchin processing plant in Chile in 1968 , but was expelled by the government of Marxist President Salvador Allende in 1970 as an unwelcome American businessman . Shayne eventually wound up in Ecuador with $20,000 in his pocket and decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first shrimp farm . Now a millionaire , Shayne is one of dozens of wealthy shrimp farmers in Ecuador . <P> The country 's equatorial climate along the coast is ideally suited to the new industry . In an operation resembling the Central London Hatchery in Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World , adult shrimp are fished from the sea and placed in large tanks where subtle and carefully controlled variations in light and water temperature induce breeding . Pregnant females-each producing 150,000 to 200,000 eggs-are transferred by hand to separate hatching tanks , where an average of 90,000 eggs survive to become adolescent shrimp . After 17 days , always just around dawn to avoid damage by sunlight , the young shrimp are transferred to maturation ponds . There , with technicians and the anxious farmers standing by , they grow to adults . <P> Shayne 's ponds are dug on the coastal flatlands , shored by timbering and fed by a canal . The square pools produce 800 lbs . per acre at each harvest , and he gets three harvests a year , a far higher yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than two harvests of approximately 300 to 400 lbs . each . In a laboratory up the coast from Shayne 's ponds , experts work on secret methods for getting shrimp to produce more eggs ; in another plant machines compact food similar to cattle feed so that it stays in one piece under water . Shrimp , it seems , like their food intact . <P> Shayne is already the world 's biggest single exporter of farmed shrimp , although competitors are growing rapidly . Fish farming , practiced by the Chinese some 4,000 years ago , is producing shrimp in commercial quantities in countries like Japan and the Philippines . It is going on also in states such as Hawaii , California and Florida , and there is even a research facility in landlocked Arizona . Says Shayne : " If you do it right , this is the best business going . The returns are even better than from growing marijuana . " <P> The profits are indeed substantial and have created a kind of gold-rush atmosphere in Ecuador . An investment of $1,200 to $2,000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . Says Joe Fischer , an aquaculture expert brought in from Hawaii by Shayne : " People are racing to get ponds dug , even when they have no idea what they are doing . "
