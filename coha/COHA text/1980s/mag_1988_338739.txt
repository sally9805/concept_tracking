I spent a year in the Gate City to the South , which was then still known to some as the Dogwood City , around the time it was trying to become the City Too Busy to Hate . That 's the way people in Atlanta might think of it , and that 's the way I think of it . We share a weakness for slogans . This was at the beginning of the ' 60s , and I was a reporter covering the civil rights story . Those who traveled the South back then  --  reporters or regional auditors or salesmen with the Southeast territory  --  came to roost at the end of the week in Atlanta precisely because it was the Gate City to the South : we needed the airport . They used to say that someone who died in the South might go to heaven , but he 'd have to change planes in Atlanta . <P> Even in those days , when Atlanta 's stature was based on the access it afforded to places like Valdosta and Meridian and Demopolis , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the company of civic boosters , they would begin by telling me about how many FORTUNE 500 companies were represented in the city and how much higher in altitude and more westerly in longitude it was than anyone might have imagined  --  anyone , they must have meant , who had never met an Atlanta booster . Then , if there was a lull in the conversation , they would sometimes say , " You know , Atlanta is the fourth target on the Kremlin 's map of nuclear destruction . " <P> I usually found myself stuck for a reply . It was difficult enough to conjure up the picture of Soviet generals  --  hefty , beetle-browed men in bulky overcoats  --  leaning over a map while the Air Marshal for Nuclear War Contingency Planning says , " Then we 'll get Atlanta and take out all the Southeastern branch offices in one swoop . " Even if that were the Russians ' plan , how would Atlanta people know about it ? A Chamber of Commerce mole in the Kremlin ? Even if they knew about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be up toward the front in a queue awaiting annihilation ? <P> Sooner or later , I realized that Atlanta , which has always been preoccupied with its image , can view almost any event as just another opportunity to shine . Even General Sherman 's burning of Atlanta has been a matter of pride , central to the saga of a great city rising from the ashes , although Sherman did not exactly " burn Atlanta . " He did destroy whatever was of value to the Confederate war effort , but , according to Franklin Garrett , the city 's official historian , Atlanta suffered less damage during the war than Columbia , S.C. , or Richmond , Va . When was the last time you heard anything about Columbia , S.C. , rising from the ashes ?
