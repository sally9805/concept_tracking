Washington insists that Japan open up its market to foreigners <P> <P> Last year the battle was over automobiles and trucks . Now Japan and the other major industrial countries are heading for an even more serious collision . At issue this time is whether or not Japan 's byzantine web of nontariff import barriers is really just disguised protectionism , and , if so , what should be done about it . <P> Two weeks ago high-level trade officials from the U.S. , Canada , the European Community and Japan held two days of meetings in Key Biscayne , Fla . One of the messages of the session was a warning to Japan 's Minister of Trade and Industry , Shintaro Abe , that his country must open its market to more imports . Abe replied that Japan would take " drastic " action before the end of the month to make it easier for the U.S. and other countries to sell their products in Japan . <P> Last week Abe jetted to Washington , where he heard the same story from President Reagan , Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other top Administration officials . According to American estimates , the value of Japanese exports to the U.S. grew last year by 23% , to $37.7 billion , in part because of the strength of the U.S. dollar , which encouraged imports and discouraged exports . Indeed , American exports to Japan increased by only about 4% , to $21.5 billion . <P> Since taking office a year ago , the Administration has struggled to convince Japan that it must open up its domestic market to more foreign imports if it wants to head off tit-for-tat protectionism in the U.S. Progress has come slowly . With the U.S. economy now in a deepening recession that is sending unemployment leaping , calls for retaliation are rising just as the Administration had warned . Says Deputy U.S. Trade Representative David MacDonald : " I see a crisis in late spring or summer . The problem is the closed Japanese market itself . We are not talking about the Japanese restraining exports , we are talking about them opening up their own domestic market . " <P> The complaints against Japan are also coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found their own trade with Japan tilting increasingly in Tokyo 's favor . Says a top Common Market official in Brussels : " Of course the Japanese sense that something has to be done . But getting them to open up their markets is like starting a car with a flat battery on a cold winter 's day . It grinds for a while , and then it just stops . " <P> What angers U.S. and European officials is not the marketing prowess of Japanese exporters , but the complex regulations that hamper foreign businessmen in Japan . Examples abound . An American maker of aluminum baseball bats was developing a good market for his product until the Japanese softball association ruled that his bats could not be used in tournament play . Reason : the label stamped on them supposedly made them defective . Companies selling products in aerosol spray cans complain that their cans must be 25% thicker in Japan than anywhere else in the world . Moreover , the outfit that inspects the incoming aerosol products is a prime Japanese spray-can maker .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
