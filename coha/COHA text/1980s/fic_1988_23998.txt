S T HIDALGOS By Bob Shacochis LYT hat 's wrong with Americans ? Buena , I will tell you . " He was a Dominican  --  not only a grower but an exporter of coffee , flying south out of Miami on to Puerto Plata . Thus he began to brief Mitchell Wilson , a businessman of sorts himself , not long after they had lifted off . Wilson listened with one ear , showed interest with one eye , smiled insincerely with half his mouth , all the while concentrating on his news magazine . " One minute , " the Dominican interrupted himself , as a flight attendant walked up the aisle . " Sssstt , be-be , three Johnny Walker Negro . " He looked at Wilson . " Wha ' you want , man !

Wilson flipped a page , not admitting he was curious about the peccadilloes of nationality .

A new collection of his stories , Celebrations of the New World , will be published early next year . and camouflage pants and mujahedin scarves . Most of the guns were bare , some were draped in olive tarps , but one had been covered with a Persian blanket , its patterns aqua , powder blue , swirls of white , and the weapon and its mount were transformed into a beautiful shape , like a blue heron poised to land on a tidal marsh .

" A Korean student pitched a Molotov'cocktail into the air . The photo was unrealistically cropped , forcing the protestor to act in isolation , deprived of support , robbed of an enemy . The landing gear shuddered into position ; the jet banked for its approach to the Salt Islands , where Wilson would disembark . The Dominican neither stopped smoking nor fastened his seat belt . Wilson squeezed around him into the aisle . " You getting off at this crazy worthless place ? " the Dominican asked , his eyebrows lowered in disbelief . " Jesus !

Think , if you will , of the drive between San Antonio and Laredo , that dry and ominous countryside , armored with spikes and stingers . The Salts are pieces of the same geographical mood , chipped off the continent to float in a sparkling paradisiacal sea . On the resort island of Flamingo , where Wilson had landed , there was a brief stretch of expertly paved road leading from the airport along a stagnant lagoon , defunct salt Yes , ugly , flat  --  and yet Flamingo had exquisite beaches , and these bone-white virgin strands were attracting turtles ( the native term for tourists ) by the tens of thousands since the new runway was completed a few years back . Wilson 's driver veered away from the sea now , off the main unpaved road to a lesser one probing lower land , where the moist air was laden not with oceanic brine but with the earthy aroma of mineral wealth . Shortly they braked in front of the lone few acres of honest fecundity on the entire length of the atoll , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-high ; behind it they had actually gotten a lawn to grow , Faye and Alberts had , a yard to be mowed , probably the first on Flamingo.The citrus trees were twice the height they were when Wilson had been here last ; pole-trunked papayas embowered the tin roof of the cottage Faye and Alberts had built themselves for a pittance . pans hosting junked cars ; then seven miles of badly paved road ; then an unpaved road leeward ; and finally two ruts across a chalky surface paddled with milky water . No trees : Flamingo was brittle-thorn acacia , dwarf palms , pigeon-pea bushes , impenetrable thickets of cacti and bayonet plants . And amid this stunted , unfriendly growth , dead , blackened limestone-coral knolls lay scattered like Creation 's own slag . The black Lab-mix charged from the potting shed , barked once for the sake of reputation , and then flopped on his back , exposing his flea-bitten genitals for inspection . The blacks on the island were terrified of black dogs  --  somewhere in their collective past was a notorious one  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island standard by Faye . Tacked to the door of the screened porch wa Illustrations 1 , y David Johnson STORY 55 a computer-printed notice , that Wilson read : SALT ISLANDS NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING LTD .

Mon  --  Fri ... except when ? the trucks are both broken down on the road  - -  we 're fishing , diving , or partying ( Wilson grunted ; Alberts had n't gone fishing or diving in years . ) ? Alberts is drinking his lunch in one of the local bars , which means we 're only open from 8 A.m. ? noon ? anyone comes by on the way to the beach , in which case we might have gone with them . ( Faye , yes ; Alberts , no . He was sick of the beach . ) The nursery will then be open anytime that day when we are not at the beach . If there 's a problem , leave a message with Bozo and we will get back with you . Bozo being a macaw , inherited from a restaurant gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , not to be trusted with fingers , given to brooding existential moods and swift infatuations . He had been enamored of Faye , followed her everywhere , repeating , as she had taught him , one rudeness after another . " Alberts , " Wilson hallooed , unsticking the warped frame of the screen door . He set his luggage down and stood lulled by the homestead serenity that was the atmosphere of every tent , shanty , sailboat , or house inhabited by the two vagabonds , Faye and Alberts , the secure do-it-yourself clutter , the professionally makeshift life , as comfortable as a rag rug . " Alberts ? " So recognizable , this island peace back in the bush . There on the worktable was Faye 's typewriter , a white hand towel spread over it to keep out dust . He lifted the covering  --  well , it did n't have to be , but the carriage was empty . No letters-in-progress , reports to Burton 's clinic in Freeport , to some authority or other about sea turtles or porpoises , blue-shelled lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and now , finally why had it taken so long ? Wilson was feeling it with guilty relief . Alberts 's voice . " Back here , " he called . Wilson crossed the shallow depth of the cottage , stepped through a sliding door to the deck and the open-air kitchen . Alberts was at the gas stove , heating refried beans in an iron skillet . They would be tasty , Wilson knew , knowing Alberts . And knowing Alberts , the glass he saluted with contained rum and water , half and half . Wilson relaxed . At least Alberts was eating as well as drinking , not yet so much a part of the everyday shifts of alignment that he had gone to pieces , as burdened white men were supposed toin the tropics , crawling on their hands and knees , letting pathos ride their backs like a monkey . Faye had died  --  Alberts had taken her to Miami two months ago to do it . First , though , he had spent a year with her on the road : the clinic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments , a faith healer in West Palm , another clinic in Greece , what must have been a sorrow-stricken , one-day return to Flamingo , back on the plane the following morning to Miami , a damn hotel room off the interstate near the hospital . She had called Wilson from there , only to hang up before she finished a sentence . Alberts had taken her ashes out to the reef about a week ago . What was left was to clear out , and he had asked Wilson to help if he could . " Until this minute ... " Wilson began , his throat hardening . " Oh boy . I really miss her . " " Listen . Knock it off . She 's here , she 's all around us . You 're a fool if you do n't know that , so stop worrying about it . " He took the skillet off the heat and smiled . " I 'll tell you what her last words were  --  Tell Wilson to go fuck himself ' " He laughed . " You want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagging below negligible hips , belted under the puff of his stomach . The sleeves of his work shirt were rolled up past his elbows , the front left unbuttoned , the tails tied loosely at his waist . He had on a cap too , a relic of the Tesoro Corporation , a salvage outfit he nearly got off the ground ; and though his neck and forearms were athletically tanned , everywhere else his skin was pallid , much too protected , slack beginning to threaten in the flesh . His carefully groomed beard and much of his hair had whitened . He was worn out , had stepped in his mind through the bottoms of his shoes , and he intended to repatriate himself to the States , where he had not lived for twenty-three years . Wilson figured Alberts should stay put , but he was n't going to say anything without being invited to , and knowing Alberts , there was n't going to be an invitation . Up until the past year , when she had no choice but to look like a dying middle-aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hipster , someone in a photograph taken , say , in 1958 , at a caf ? poetry reading . Alberts had met her in the Village , an errant daughter of a first family of Virginia , working on her Ph.D . in psychology at NYU . She had known all the writers , all the geek intellectuals . He tended bar on MacDougal Street , kept company with the folk musicians , all the queer actors and actresses , but he had been to war in Korea and to something like it in Cuba , married to and divorced from a model who had been given pearls by Sinatra  --  as if he , Alberts , a kid from Kansas City , had let his life be defined by Hollywood and the Pentagon . But only for a while ; by the time he met Faye he had focused elsewhere . The two talked the type of fast and faraway talk everybody indulges in en route to bed ; but when they drove together to New Orleans , neither of them turned out to be bluffing . Alberts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faye , goddamn her , was fearless . Some life they were cutting themselves loose into . Wilson first ran into them in ' 72 when he was working in international development in Costa Rica . They were out on the coast , Puerto Li-mein , preposterous yanquis , shark fishing , trot-lines bated with offal strung across the river mouth . Next , there was a copra plantation up North , then a bogus gold mine in Colombia , a charter business , a restaurant one place , then still another one , a three-table enterprise . When her breasts were removed , she was given six agonizing months to live . But Faye was a headstrong . difficult woman . Anybody who had ever been in a room with her for five minutes could have guessed her reaction . Wrong , was all she had to say . Her revenge against the arrogance of science lasted eight willful years . They arrived in the Salts with nothing  --  little money and Faye 's cancer , two suitcases and a box of tools coated with axle grease . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunities was discreet and bizarre : they fried chicken , packed box lunches for smugglers ; babysat shopping bags of cash for a thousand dollars an hour ; inherited hundreds of five-gallon pots of South Florida dirt , each with a withered sprig at its center  --  an unlikely bounty from one of the high priests of the substance trade , his scheme to ornament his hideaway estate with flowering extravagance preempted by a hitch in one shipment that led to time in jail . The first and only nursery on Flamingo ; that was it , hidalgos , Alberts and Faye had fiTnally declared themselves at home . ilson accepted the highball glass of rum , adding juice and ice from the refrigerator . Alberts lumped beans into two mugs and handed one to Wilson , then asked what his schedule was . " Get pissed to the gills with you , " Wilson said . " Ah , yes . " " But first , as soon as we can , sit down with the people at the Ministry , get over to Cockburn Cay , meet their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ? Can he tell a customer from a pH content ? Talk to your lawyer , talk to the government 's lawyers . " From behind a rough lattice screen separating the kitchen from the grounds , its diamonds woven solid with passion-fruit vine , materialized one of the Haitian laborers . His face was a shadow beneath the brim of a straw hat that would have looked right on Huck Finn . He held a machete and a fat green pumpkin . " Keep it for yourself , Raicees . " He went over and laid his hand on the small man 's shoulder . " Cook it for yourself and Luciano . Or sell it to one of the ladies in the Bight . " The worker held out the pumpkin , as though he expected his employer to take it . He raised his chin , light falling across his round boy 's face , deferential and puzzled , " Anything else out there  --  cucumbers or squash  --  you and Luciano take it home with you . " Faye had scattered vegetable seeds throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand you . Does he ? " Alberts shook his head , abstracted , thinkin of something else . Well ... yeah , mostly . Faye would only speak to them in Spanish , which is better . " He took his hand away from Raicees , and he was gone . " They do n't believe me . " The beans were too dry , like spackling ; Alberts was losing his touch . Wilson reached for the bottle of red salsa on the shelf . " You 're always leaving , " he said to Alberts , gently bringing the conversation back around to business , " and you 're always coming back . " " Not this time . " They went inside the cottage and sat down , one at each end of the convertible couch . Alberts and Faye had slept right there for four years , molested by no-see-urns , no privacy , as if they were still on one of the boats , often waking with hangovers to customers on the porch rapping on the glass door  --  until , after the Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alberts slouched , balancing his drink on belly . " Look , " he began , " the Cockburn Cay people are n't worth seeing . They 've rooted some cuttings ; Faye gave them a sack of neem seeds but they could n't get them sprouted . They have papaya seedlings in Dixie cups . Their shade shed was knocked down in the last hurricane and it 's still down . " Alberts smiled ruefully . " I 'm sorry I asked you to get mixed up in it . " Wilson , now that he understood Alberts was retreating from the deal , was apologetic himself . " I wanted to come down earlier , before Faye died . At least for the wake ... This was the best I could do . " There was another buyer , Alberts said . " A white kid , French , here with his wife and baby . Nice guy , same figure , he 's ready to do it . Why not ? The government would let this place go to hell , right ? " Righter than right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irreversible release . It was no skin off Wilson 's nose ; better , really  --  an individual with a family would prove a more reliable debtor than any government in power in the Salts . The closing was set for Thursday morning , Alberts said , so nothing important had changed . " You can stay here if you like . We fixed up one of the tool sheds into a bungalow . It is n't fancy . It is n't even clean . " Wilson wanted to stay ; he said he would n't leave until he saw the papers signed  --  just in case . Bozo came to the door , rocking from foot to foot , eavesdropping ; and Alberts flattered the bird , saying how pretty he was , poured him a cup of orange juice , two more rums to celebrate the smooth resolution of Wilson 's arrival , the alteration of plans . They might as well go ahead and get soused , Alberts proposed , and not worry about a damn thing . The bird gargled with his juice ; the voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their creole like the singsong of effeminate boys . Boat people , working without papers  --  Wilson had been thrown the first time he heard the way they responded to their employers ; the endearments , the childlike intimacy , a code of filial love claimed by the dispossessed . Yes , mommy . Merci , mommy . Drink of water , mommy . I ca n't believe them , either , Faye had said , giggling . Cubans raise hell , Haitians kiss the foot that holds them down in their own filth . She gave them anything they wanted except mechanical things , because she had once given Raicees a padlock for a shed and he had broken it . Tell me , she had asked Wilson , how do you bung up a lock and key in five minutes ? Poppit  --  this was Luciano , years ago , pointing at Alberts 's wristwatch  --  how much ? Not how much time left to work , because what did that matter , but how many holes would a man have to dig to purchase such an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both men new ones for Easter , the next available holiday . They made enough to buy their own , no problem , but always sent the money home to Cap Haitien . Back on the couch with a fresh drink , Alberts 's eyes wandered the room . There was a plaid recliner chair of unguessable origin , its foam stuffing in pieces on the floor , ejected by nesting mice . Nails in the plywood hung with foul-weather oilskins , diving gear , Faye 's sextant and binoculars , rusty fishing lures , a bwana pith helmet Faye sometimes wore for fun . A gun rack for a shotgun , a BB rifle for feral cats . A shortwave radio , a citizens band that would have been crackling had the nursery been open for business , a cassette player with speakers wired into the shade shed . ( The arum family  --  caladium , dieffenbachia , ceriman , Hunter 's Robe  --  was being introduced to Nina Simone and Eric Von Schmidt the last time Wilson was in the Salts . ) Shells and seed pods , shards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of Alberts 's son by his first wife , now at college in Madison . All the remaining space , the shelves and the floor , was warehoused with books  --  gorged with manuals , novels , paperbacks , classic and trashy ; spilling stacks of garden magazines , coffee-ringed alternative-health bulletins , entomology journals , seed and equipment catalogues . " I have to pack , " Alberts said , but they both stayed as they were . In the early evening , Wilson mentioned he she doubled over , head on her knees , strangled by laughter that infected the two men until they too were whooping and choking , and Wilson parked in the middle of the dark island road , unable to hold the wheel . They had few choices for dinner  --  it was no longer the tourist season . The yacht club , a club more by name than by practice , seemed to be the best place open . They sat at the bar and studied a chalkboard menu . " Get whatever you want , " Alberts insisted . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Crown Prince of Flamingo . " Wilson cleared his head . " Ten percent down ? I thought you were asking more . " " I was , I did , " Alberts nodded . " I got it . . . the other share goes into Cholly 's pocket . " " What ? " In a fool 's pocket is where it was going . Wilson had strolled through the grounds after putting sheets on the mattress in the bungalow . had let the nursery run down . He had lounged in his underwear on the office couch for twelve months  --  a model castaway , reading mysteries and warrior adventures and drinking quinine while Alberts followed Faye from treatment to treatment . " Do n't talk to me about it , " Alberts said . " Order anything you want if you 're my friend . " Alberts bought a drink for anyone who walked in , as long as there was no talk of him as if he were a victim of Faye 's demise . He had no patience for rituals of mourning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sterile atmosphere of the club receded in alcoholic laughter , and by the time he finished eating , the bar was packed two-deep , the tables occupied in the restaurant section . " Would you sleep with an old soft-brained mullet like me ? " he heard Alberts , making the rounds now , tease a young woman out of habit and style , a vestige of appreciation ; that afternoon Alberts had hinted at impotency and his general indifference to a cure . Cholly arrived , Flamingo 's premier ne'er-do-well , to a fanfare of vulgarity from his competition . Wilson had never known him to wear anything but a uniform of aggressive unemployment : an epauletted bush shirt , baggy khaki shorts , plastic sandals , and his beard grown high on his cheeks . There was nothing a white man could n't do in the Salts that Cholly had n't done  --  except get rich or move on . " Caveat emptor , " he grumbled to the woman behind the bar , demanding his regular tonic . " Let the buyer bloody well beware with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks was no more than a game . Cholly then turned to scrutinize Wilson with an arrogant smile . " What brings you snooping around ? " he challenged , in command of a thousand affectations , measuring Wilson through half-lidded eyes . Suddenly his manner changed , and he pumped Wilson 's hand , blustering with good-natured fellowship . " Good to see you , sir . We missed having you aboard when we dunked Faye . " It was as if Cholly were Noel Coward 's younger brother , banished to the tropics , there to corrupt the art of theatrics and dramatize the craft of personal corruption . " How 's Alberts been holding up ? " Wilson asked . Cholly blinked , pursed his fleshy lips , acting out the act of evaluation . Finally he spoke . " How the bloody hell does he seem to you ? " " He seems all right . Thrown off a cliff , but the same . " " Ah , " said Cholly , " very well then . That 's all there is to it then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . He 's drinking himself into the crematory fires . It 's a proper tradition here . However , " Cholly held up a blunt finger , " I 'm afraid it will not travel well . What will the poor bastard do in the Great White North ? Bag groceries ? Carpool with your Mister Hasenfus ? " Alberts emerged from the muddle and wrapped an arm around Wilson , patting his shoulder . He looked disoriented and swollen , and leaned with most of his weight . " Look who 's here ? " Next to Alberts stood a lank man , square-jawed , a head of bleachy hair , a beard thin and colorless , with pockmarked skin and predatory eyes . He was a Scandinavian , a Norwegian , Wilson remembered , but could n't think of his name . A builder or an architect : Flamingo was thick with both . " ? Nils . " Nils had housed Faye and Alberts for a couple months when they first came to the island . " What did they do with all the black peoplie around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Club Med questioned the bar-tender . " Dey is teefin ' you room dis very minute , " she answered , and punished him with a scowl . Alberts suddenly turned gloomy and wanted to leave . " Let 's all go on out to the nursery , " he said . " I want Wilson to hear the song we played when we took Faye out to the reef " Whiffs of Thelonious Monk crackled down decided he should n't sit there . While he was out on the porch to get a chair , the screen door nudged and rattled , and he opened it for Bozo to come in for the soiree . " Oh God , look , " one of the girls exclaimed . The stylized edges of her hair looked as if they 'd been blown back from her scarlet face by an explosion . Where had these women come from ? Wilson thought . Did they live on Flamingo ? Guests of their fathers , brutal wizards of real estate ? Sorority field trip ! It 's a parrot ! Is n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , using his enormous black beak to haul himself up . The other girl sprang to her feet and stood by the rear door , no friend to feathered things , watching the bird waddle along the spine of the couch and stop , inspecting her companion . " Polly want a cracker ? " the girl on the couch asked , reaching out her hand slowly . The bird cocked its head , appraised the rings on her fingers ; the feathers bristled at the back of its neck , a request to be scratched . " Polly want a cracker ? " she persisted . Bozo straightened up , realizing she was n't really going to touch him . " Polly want a cracker ? " Bozo eyed her keenly . " Fuck off , " he shrieked , and Cholly rumbled with demonic chuckling . Faye had taught the bird to be indignant when people annoyed him with the cracker routine . " He despises crackers , " Cholly explained . " Why do n't you ask him if he likes oral sex ? " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loaded down with clothes still on their hangers . " I want you all to have these , " he announced ; you could see his mind turning , trying to match the pair of men 's slacks at the top of his pile to a body . Nils and Cholly ignored him , but Wilson and the two girls raised their eyebrows at one another . The lack of response seemed to bother him not at all . Then his eyes flashed with enthusiasm and he dumped the clothes in the middle of the room . Wilson stared uncomfortably at the pile . " I 've got something for you ladies too , " Alberts said , winking , and turned on his heels . One of the girls lit a joint . Wilson thought he would strike up a conversation with Nils . " What is this music ? " he asked . " Is this ... Monk ? " He was astonished when the Norwegian snarled . " You do n't know anything about jazz . First , you 're an American . Second , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cholly passed him the joint as Alberts clumped back into the room , waving something long and pink . " Gaw ! " The girl on the couch looked at her friend , and they both tittered . " Are those dildos ? Look how big they are ! " " Take them if you want them , " Alberts recommended happily . There were four of them that he sailed across the room one at a time , flipping them like throwing knives . " Someone traded them for a plant . They 've never been used . Faye did n't go in for that stuff . " Alberts wandered over to the cassette player . The music stopped and began again , something different , poorly recorded and scratchy , an almost familiar maudlin voice singing about a dolphin . Out of the corner of his eye , Wilson watched the girl with the peeled-back hair handle a dildo , place it to her lips and crack up , raise it back and part her mouth . Good Lord , he thought , do n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen to this , Wilson , " Alberts encouraged from the corner . Nils spat his accusation a second time . " You 're too young to know shit about jazz . " He was , inexplicably , angry , and Wilson was getting there . " Listen to this , would you ? " He had no idea why the Scandinavian thought Americans were disenfranchised from their own music , but at least he could argue that Nils was no more than a few years older than him . He felt his attention splinter . " What the hell are you talking about ? " The tape ejected , leaving behind a static buzz that paralyzed the room . Wilson ducked just in time to avoid being hit by the cassette Alberts whipped at his head . An opposing wave of fury surged through him ; he was n't a kid anymore , he did n't have to sit there and bite his tongue and take an offense from Alberts he did n't deserve . Still , he gaped at Alberts , utterly stupefied , and could n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head wagging , flushed and bitter . " I wanted you to hear that song . l put it on for you . Faye loved that song . " " Why did you throw it ? " Wilson protested , " Why would you do a thing like that ? " Cholly , firm and steady with genuine authority , rose from the recliner . " Okay , old salt , " he said with surprising tenderness . He carefully slipped his arm around Alberts and led him , docile , defeated by the impulse of his generosity , back through the cottage . " Let 's put you to bed . " " I 'm freaked , " the girl hensive about the bird Faye . " Wilson about Faye . ometime soon after dawn , with the nursery flooded with damp heavy light , Wilson awoke on his pallet in the primitive bungalow and ' t stop baby , do n't stop . Alberts was up and dressed , making coffee . He moved around with a wooden gait , as if his hips were damaged , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with his mood , though  --  he gave a hearty greeting , reconciliation a form of auto-response for both men , all the mornings down through the years , forgiving each other the trespasses and crossed signals of the previous evening . Wilson went straight to the refrigerator for juice , but grabbed a papaya instead , and cut himself a slice . " Whose disgraceful birds are those out back ? " " Cholly 's , " Alberts replied . " Cholly , " he called over his hack , " you 've got to get the birds and everything else that 's yours out of here today . " The Frenchman Bruno , the new owner , wanted to scrub down the house inside and out and have its bare walls whitewashed . The Frenchman could n't stand Cholly anyway , and had asked Alberts to make sure to put him out . Cholly , his nose in a book , waved acknowledgment from the couch . " The Gray is mentally disturbed . Victim of a broken home . " Cholly then sniffed , hobbled outside to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Descending into lethargy , Wilson went hack to the bungalow and spent a half hour under the cold shower , waking up finally to a more tenacious spirit . He reappeared at the cottage in a bathing suit , a towel slung around his neck . Alberts , in the recliner , pawed through a carton of loose photographs , a rum and water next to him on the floor . Wilson could see he was n't feeling well either . " Something to eat ? " " Naw , " Wilson said , " I 'm going to walk down to the beach . " Who would have believed it , but Alberts told Wilson to wait , he would go with him . He handed Wilson a set of snapshots while he went to change . They were pictures of Faye 's burial , all the local expat crowd and a few somber island faces , going to sea on one of the dive boats bedecked with flowers . Alberts , grim immobility , on the stem , while a heavyset man with a walrus mustache and a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plume of white entering the frothy wake of the engines . The other passengers each held a hibiscus blossom to throw or a bottle of beer or both . Wilson shuffled through the pictures . Alberts on the boat alone , white hair wisping from under a Navy bill cap , wearing an ironed white shirt and camouflage pants , a posy of vermilion impatiens clutched in both hands . Next picture , Faye in better times . Bozo atop her pith helmet , Blackie at her feet on a leash , his punishment for chasing cars . Her smile of tenability , as always , said , Your information is reliable  --  of course , we survive . The young nursery proliferated in the background . Wilson shuffled again and Faye rose dying , propped with pillows in a motel bed , her blonde hair stuck with poisonous sweat to her gaunt face , hands together but you can bet not in prayer , and her expression , the warm confidence of belief , was the same , infuriatingly the same . Alberts lay beside her , clearly expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the front room in a faded bathing suit and long-sleeved shirt , his legs as pale as an Edwardian banker 's . " Can I have this photograph , Alberts ? " Wilson asked without thinking , holding it up to show which one he meant . Disgusted , Alberts tried to stifle an expression identical to that in the picture . " Why do you want a picture of her when she was sick ? What 's wrong with you ? " Alberts 's remonstration embarrassed Wilson , and he could n't think of what to say . " I do n't know , " he mumbled . He tried to palliate his request , to make it seem less morbid . " She was the bravest person 1 ever knew . " Alberts relented . " Keep it if you want then , " he said , " but take one of the other pictures too . I do n't want you to have just that one . " At the beach , they sat and splashed in the shallow water , groaning with relief . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep his cigarette from getting wet , seemed to constantly pantomime a man asking for quiet . " 1 love this , " he said . " This is the life , and I 've led it . " Wilson pointed out to him that Faye , who had strived for six years to bring him back in the glorious water or get him on one of the cays for a picnic , would kick his backside if she were there . " I was tired of it all , " explained Alberts . " Hey , I 'd had enough . " And was n't it Faye who said the opposite of a good life is not necessarily a bad life ! The opposite of a profound truth may very well be another profound truth . " This is the greatest thing on the planet , this water , " Alberts crowed with pleasure , and under he went , glasses , cigarette , beer and all . By the time they toweled themselves dry and left , Alberts 's face resembled a pomegranate , his shoulders and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped with a wire brush .

" Alberts , " he lectured , both amused and impatient , " what are you doing ? You never go to the beach and now you go to the beach ? You 're supposed to be moving out , eh ? " He gestured at a five-gallon drum of paint he had lugged in . " Look , I stole that from the airport  --  they 're too disorganized to know what 's going on , " he confessed with laughter . " I think it should be enough , yes ? " The Frenchman paced around the room , surveying for other reasons to be there . " Alberts , where are the Haitians ? I want them to start throwing out all the junk in the main shed . Okay with you ? Are they around ? How did you get so much junk out there ? It all has to go . " He walked out back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Wilson . " A real capitalist . " " He 's all right . It 'll be good for the place . He 'll unwind . " " He 's going to burn up trying to make this into a white man 's business . " " Compadre , " Alberts said . He was his most gentle self . " Tome una Cuba Libre conmigo , si ? " " Buena , " Wilson agreed , and in a minute he was back with the drinks . " She betrayed me , my friend , " Alberts said , his voice no louder than the fluid sound of water outside , pressure-driven from the hand-dug wells , beginning to soak the nursery . " You know how it was with us . Then she kept getting sicker and sicker ... and she wanted to live . " By the following morning a front had settled fee and listened to the BBC . Bozo wanted attention ; Alberts picked him up and put him on his shoulder , but the sunburn was too sensitive , so he let the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pot of jam . Blackie was asleep on the deck , twitching , curled around his empty food dish . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do about these animals , " Alberts fretted , staring red-eyed at the dog . " I should shoot them , I suppose . " " What shit , " Wilson protested . Macho melodrama . " They 'll be fine . " Alberts conceded , too exhausted to be offended . " You 're right , " he groused . The Frenchman Bruno parked out front in a swirl of dust and honked several times before he bounded merrily into the cottage , his personality unaffected by the drop in barometrics , there to make certain they were out of bed , preparing for town . " Where 's Cholly ? " Bruno questioned Wilson . Cholly had n't come home the night before  --  nothing extraordinary . Bruno turned to Alberts . " Where is he ? " " Do n't worry , " Alberts said . " Cholly will show up . He 'll be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as he 'd arrived , speeding off into a horizon of lowering gray clouds . When Alberts had brushed his teeth a second time and combed the stiffness in his paper-white hair , they left too . The road was thick with traffic racing toward them , buses and vans carrying the day shift of workers to Club Med or farther down leeward where a marina was under construction . Four times Alberts instructed Wilson to pull over to pick up a walker , pedestrians too poor for transport , old black women toting bundles on their skulls . " Mistah Alberts , " the law one said , much like the others , " tank you , sah . We ahll shall meet again in heaven , sah . Dro me here , please . " Wilson let Alberts off at the two-story yellow stucco where the lawyers ' offices were , watching him walk like an old man up the steps that led to the upper arcade . He then parked in the office lot and smoked a cigarette , which he almost never did anymore . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a balcony , opened a door upon a woman typing who told him the number of the conference room . He knocked once and sauntered in , At the head of an oblong table , the Commonwealth lawyer , a Canadian , thumbed through a portfolio of documents . Never had Wilson heard a bad word said against this robust , optimistic man . The two of them had been bonefishing once , in fact , and the solicitor , unmindful of the interruption , rose to offer his hand . " How 's it been going ? " Wilson asked . " Anybody cut anybody 's throat yet ? " " Speeding along , " the lawyer said , and grinned and sat back down . " Keeping these magnates happy . " He opened a hardbound ledger of Royal Bank checks . " You made it , I see , " Wilson said , nodding at Cholly . Cholly said nothing . He reeked of eau de cologne , sat composed and erect in his chair , smug with the dubious talent of his resiliency . And Bruno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets and scanned the contract , his knees clapping methodically , his fingers drumming the arm of his chair . Alberts  --  whatever remained of Alberts appeared to have turned radically inward . He hunched forward , his elbows on the table and eyes downcast , sun poisoned , despondent . The lawyer tore the check he had written from its book . " Seventeen thousand five hundred and so on . " Cholly pressed it to his mouth , folded it into the bottom pocket of his bush shirt . " Cholly , we know each other well , " the lawyer stated diplomatically . " When you leave here , go right to the hank , would you please , and deposit it . " Impossible to insult Cholly . He was presented the appropriate document for his signature ; then the lawyer left the room to make a copy of it on his machine . Wilson found it unbearable to look across the table at Alberts 's wordless inertia , his wounded sobriety , unbearable because his sympathy was limited  --  Alberts should be stronger , take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wanted . Wilson got up for a cup of coffee from the electric pot and stood at the window . It was raining but not hard . Behind the offices the foundation of another building was under construction . It was going to be big , ambitious , maybe the biggest structure in the Salts , by the looks of it . The first circle of workmen  --  Haitian laborers ; no one else would do what they would  --  went about their business , exposed to the solemn drizzle , the paste of the disturbed ground . They were stripped to the waist , lean torsos glistening , their heads wrapped in bright bandanas  --  colors vibrating without sunlight , color full of sap , color that would burst with juice if the surface was penetrated , The men had dug footings that from above composed a checkerboard pattern , each black up to his hips in his respective hole , their dark muscles smeared with gluey sand , ragged pants caked with muck . As Wilson observed their movements , the rain suddenly became a downpour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought shelter . He wished he had a camera to record the strangely vital image of the men as the squall passed and they resumed their positions on the checkerboard , and the game started again . Hewould expect such a picture to explain what he could n't , to be its own news about the tides of balance among men . " Let 's wrap this up , " the lawyer said as he came back to the table , handing out identical sets of documents for each of the three to sign . He waited for Alberts 's attention to form before the accounting continued . Over five years of representation , the nursery had not paid a cent to the lawyer . Three thousand  --  a fair and decent sum  --  was subtracted from the top figure . " Now , accounts due . Let 's clear them out . " Seven thousand four hundred thirty-two et cetera . " I do n't like this any more than you do , " the lawyer sympathized . " Taxes . " Twenty-five hundred . " Closing fees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The mortgage remaining on the property . " Three thousand more . In the name of Austin Alberts , the lawyer filled out a check for seven thousand two hundred forty dollars and eleven cents U.S. There would be more , of course , monthly payments on the lien for twenty years to come . Alberts tucked the check into his pocket without looking at it . Together they all strolled to the yacht club for Bloody Marys , but the intended celebration was flat and halfhearted , so they disbanded before their glasses were emptied . Wilson drove Alberts home , put him into his bed and kissed him on the cheek . He had done what he could ; it was time to go . After he collected his gear , he took himself in one of the nursery trucks to the airport , leaving the key in the ignition , and entered the competition for a seat on the plane that would take him to Puerto Plata , then to Miami , finally back to Washington . Hidalgos today ? Such were his thoughts as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sons and daughters of nobodies . Hijos de nadie . The saints of the New World lived on in history , but their descendants , bastards of the bastards of the bastards , left in the night for America . Perhaps when they were somebodies , or the children of somebodies , they came home . Faye and Alberts  --  their vagabond marriage , the stubborn precious questing of their failures how had they measured their lives , against what standard ? Mitchell Wilson once thought he knew , but now he knew he did n't . What remained was for Alberts to enter , like the millions before him in these times , the draft of cooling current , and without further hesitation or loyalty remit himself to the North , ?
