Right now , says Michael Lipper , a mutual fund expert , the pendulum is swinging the wrong way for most fund investors . For two quarters in a row - the fourth quarter of 1983 and the first of ' 84 - mutual fund managers , as measured by Lipper Analytical Services , failed to outperform the Standard &; Poor ' s 500 index . This was the first time this happened in more than 10 years. // Mr. Lipper points out , however , that pendulums have a habit of swinging back in the other direction. // In the meantime , investors recently introduced to mutual funds may still be wondering what they have gotten into . For many of these people , their first exposure to this form of investment came in 1980 or ' 81 , when high interest rates and high inflation made money market funds ' mid-teen yields highly attractive. // Then , in August of 1982 , the stock market began its historic rally . But the impressive results from mutual funds that invest in stocks did not become fully apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual fund investors or moved from money funds to equity funds last June or July - about the time the stock market began slipping and the funds were being pulled down with it. // After being lured into mutual funds just in time to watch them take a big dive , then , these investors are probably asking themselves , ' ' Now what do I do ? ' ' // For many , the answer seems to be : ' ' Keep buying mutual funds . ' ' Monthly sales of the funds reached their second-highest level ever in April , reports the Investment Company Institute , the mutual fund trade organization . Similar results were reported for the first quarter , with sales of $11. 9 billion making the period the second-best quarter in the industry ' s history . This included sales of $5. 5 billion for common stock funds , another near-record. // It could be a case of perverse logic , but the funds ' poor performance may be the reason their sales are so high . ' ' I may be the eternal optimist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salem , Mass. , commenting on the funds ' two quarters of underperforming the S &; P 500 . ' ' But I look at numbers like that and figure the funds are about due. ' ' // History is on Mr. McDonald ' s side . A look at the long-term record of the stock market shows that while it may go down sometimes , it also goes back up - eventually surpassing previous highs . When the market goes up , the mutual funds aren ' t far behind . And when the market goes down , investors in multifund ' ' families ' ' can preserve the gains made earlier by switching to money funds . Or , if they are in a fund that permits itself to switch large portions of their assets to cash equivalents , the fund can preserve these gains for the investor . The Janus Fund of Denver and the Strong Funds of Milwaukee are two examples. // In recent months , investors could also have switched to gold funds or international funds that invest in foreign stocks . Both have outperformed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as low as they have been in a year , now may be a good time to buy mutual fund shares when they are cheap , as long as you plan to hold them for a few years . ' ' Equities and long-term bonds represent unusually good values right now , ' ' as do the funds that invest in them , Mr. Lipper says. // Also , through a technique known as ' ' dollar cost averaging , ' ' an investor in a mutual fund with a long track record of overall good performance can do well in bad times as well as good . With this system , the same amount of money is put into the fund at whatever regular intervals are selected . It may be every month , every quarter or twice a year . When the fund ' s price is down , more cheap shares will be bought . Then there will be more shares to increase in value when the fund ' s price goes back up . Again , this is really only effective for the long-term investor. // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial planners agree , is diversity . Don ' t stick with one mutual fund , no matter how well it seems to be performing . That may come as a surprise to people attracted to mutual funds partly because they tout diversified investments , but it ' s the best way to avoid getting clobbered when the price of any one fund drops through the floor. // ' ' A person should not have all their assets in one type of fund when they have various needs and investment goals , ' ' said Charles Atwell , a financial planner with Waddell &; Reed , a division of Torchmark Financial Services of Boston. // ' ' It ' s fine to have 10 to 20 percent ( of the money invested in mutual funds ) in one fund . You can go a little higher , but not much , ' ' he continued . He recommends spreading the mutual fund portfolio among several funds in a single ' ' family ' ' of funds offered by one company . ' ' This gives you the freedom to change from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Lord Abbett , Franklin , Oppenheimer , and Dreyfus are four fund families that have given investors good results with this strategy , Mr. Atwell says. // McDonald prefers spreading the investment dollars among three or four totally separate fund companies . Three that he likes for this purpose are the Strong Fund , the Nicholas Fund of Milwaukee , and the Pennsylvania Mutual Fund of New York. // Many people concentrate too much on recent performance when they are selecting a fund , says Mary Malgoire , a financial planner in Washington. // ' ' People are always trying to find the best fund for the last six months or a year , ' ' she said . ' ' That ' s not good . It ' s like chasing your tail , ' ' because the short-term leaders change so often . ' ' Look at five or 10 years. ' ' // But Ms. Malgoire adds that ' ' performance is not always the first criterion . ' ' Among the other things she looks for are flexibility of management ( being willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the volatility of the fund ( ' ' Some funds are great in up markets and lead balloons in down markets ' ' ) , and a portfolio that is as well diversified as its prospectus will allow. // Then , there is the question of how much money a person should have before ' ' graduating ' ' from investing in just mutual funds to buying some stocks on one ' s own. // The right amount , a recent survey of 10 financial planners by the Wall Street Journal found , is $20 , 000 to $25 , 000 . An individual needs at least that much investable money , the planners said , to buy 10 stocks averaging $25 a share in round lots ( 100-share blocks ) . // ' ' I think it depends on the person ' s investment nature and how they want to handle their money , ' ' Ms. Malgoire said . ' ' Some people may have half a million dollars and don ' t know anything about stocks and just want to keep their money . They should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have an interest in it . They could take one-quarter of that $20 , 000 , pick a couple of stocks , and get the experience. ' ' // ' ' I would raise the figure , ' ' said Peter Ferucci , a financial planner in Suffern , N.Y. ' ' People should not be playing the market with $20 , 000 . I wouldn ' t have them doing it with less than $50 , 000 or $100 , 000 . Depending on their goals and financial needs , you might put $50 , 000 in a managed portfolio and the rest in stocks. ' ' // ' ' I thought it was low , ' ' Mr. Atwell agreed . ' ' I wouldn ' t go below $100 , 000 to $125 , 000 . You have to have the time and temperament to go into stocks. ' ' // Mr. McDonald , however , agreed with the lower figure . ' ' I think you can start to look at some stocks above $25 , 000 , ' ' he said . ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular area or industrial sector you ' re not able to get enough of in a mutual fund. // ' ' Or you can take advantage of a special situation . The person may feel very strongly about some industry or company . Once important bases are covered , there ' s nothing wrong with putting a little extra here or there. ' ' // //
