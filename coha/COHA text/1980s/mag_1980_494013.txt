Does Crime Pay ? If its money now and we'll-worry-about-the ? taxes-later that you 're looking for , do n't talk to your stockbroker . Peo ? ple lucky enough to have thick wads in their pokes can put their money safely to work earning up to 17 percent over the next year . You may do as well in the market but you wo n't do it as safely . Persons with $100,000 can buy themselves a certifi ? cate of deposit from the bank . That means you give the bank your hundred grand and for a year or whatever term you work out , you ca n't withdraw it In return they must pay you a stated amount of interest . The amount of that interest is negotiable . Haggle the best interest rate possible out of ' em . Right now that ought to be about 17 percent or $17,000 return on your money . ( Incidentally , just because you ca n't withdraw your money does n't mean you ca n't use it Certificates of deposit are excellent collateral for loans so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deposit it may pay you to take out a loan against it . ) But for people with less than $100,000 , which is almost everybody , there is also money to be made . If you have $10,000 , or you have five and a friend has five , buy yourselves a Treasury Bill , which is paying about 14.5 percent interest at this writing . If you do n't know how to buy a bill , which is a three- or six-month loan to the government , ask your banker . There is always somebody whose job it is , for a small fee , to buy bills , but you may get put on hold a few times while the lunkheads connect with the proper person . All this ought to remind us that we are living in a different era from the one we grew up in when it comes to interest rates . In the not-so-distant old days , interest rates moved up or down very slowly and ordinary people did n't pay attention to them . You ca n't afford to do that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circa 1930-75 . So you have to cultivate the habit of shopping for interest rates whenever you 're buying anything . For a variety of reasons , the price of money will vary from place to place just like the price of Beta maxes or Cuisinarts . More than anything else , high prices inmoney evoke high emotional reactions . People who are dis- posed to fight to the death against price controls on such essentials as food think controls on money a sensible idea . The idea of money price controls is so old and so well established that we have a special name for them . They 're called usury laws . No economic crime gets a worse press than loansharking , i.e. , charging high interest rates , even 1,000 percent per year , to bad risks with no collateral . Yet the amount of money involved in loansharking is trifling compared to the volume of business done by larger and more respectable corporate criminals who do n't use clubs and brass knuckles to collect their debts ? although in the past they have been known to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) Fortune magazine did a round-up on companies con ? victed of serious crimes .

Bart 's Charts When we last left our mythical investment fund , the stock market was riding the crest of post-election euphoria . The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered around the 1,000 mark . Then reality set m , with prime rates leaping from 14.5 percent to 20 percent in just over one month and Soviet troops massing on Poland 's borders . A few weeks ago the discussion was of a rn past and a bright economic future with Reagan ecessio at the helm . Now the talk focuses on international tensions and how severe the com- ing recession will be . The Dow Jones Average has responded by dropping almost 70 points . And it has n't been a great month for our portfolio either ? with one excep ? tion , all our investments have declined in value . Several of our investments , however , have been front-page news . A Federal Trade Commission judge ordered Beatrice Foods to divest itself of Tropicana Products , the nation 's largest citrus juice processor , and , in an unprece ? dented move , ordered that Tropicana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The New York Times , never missing an opportunity for a pun , reported that Beatrice 's ownership of Tropicana created an illegal , anticompetitive " concentration " in the frozen orange juice business . ) Bea- trice is appealing the decision , of course , and the process is sure to drag on for years . The FTC had tend to block the acquisition of Tropicana in 1978 , but was overturned by higher courts . In any case , our Beatrice bonds actually registered a slight gain due to the fact that they already had suffered a large decline , and no matter what the outcome , Beatrice will remain the nation 's largest diversified food company , with Dannon yogurt , La Choy oriental foods , and Clark candy bars under its corporate roof . Our other newsrnaker was Chrysler . President Lee Iacocca called the Federal Reserve 's tightening credit poli ? cies " madness " and blamed them for ruining Chrysler 's hopes for a fourth-quarter profit . ( Who does the Fed think it is , anyway , ms sing around with Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that federal coffers had n't emptied entirely , and announced a cash rebate plan tied to the prime rate . Iacocca 's logic : the greater the interest rate , the greater the rebate , thereby overcoming the negative impact of high interest costs . The market remained unimpressed , and our Chrysler bonds took a nosedive . Our biggest loser of the month was our holding in pork bellies futures . But although it was down significantly this time , our original investment was only $96,000 , so we still are left with a healthy 450 percent gain . By the way , the surge in our bellies has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the price of bacon at your grocery store . One pound of bacon went for one dollar in New York shortly before we invested ; today it costs about $2.50 . Live cattlefutures also took a major drop this time , and if they decline much more ( about 2i1 cents a pound ) we will either have to co Our up with more money or lose our investment . Our other securities all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline of both the stork and bond markets . But once again , rising interest rates meant a better return from Dreyfus Liquid Assets , our money ur market fund . We averaged 12.4 percent interest in the last month , or $1,698 . In the last week the yield has climbed to 13.5 percent and the end is not yet in sight . Should we get rid of any of our " dogs " in order to claim a tax loss ? Well , so far we have n't sold any of our holdings , so we do n't have any gains on which we must pay taxes . Once we sell our pork bellies contracts we 'll have a large tax bill , but we 're not going to sell them before December 20 ? six months of ter we purchased them , when they become long ? term capital gains , taxable at a lower rate than short-term gains . And at that point well probably be tempted to hold on to them for at least another 12 days in order to defer all taxes to 1982 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the interest we collected , we now have $239,116 in Dreyfus Liquid Assets to begin round six . This month 's selection will be Gulf Oil . Gulf is trading at $4494 , which allows us to buy 2,250 shares for $99,563 with $996 ( one percent ) going to our broker as commission . After 24 weeks our portfolio looks like this : 13nn Rubenstein is vice president of finance and administra ? tion of the Media Commentary Council , Inc. crime pay ? If it does , should we be investing our hard-earned drachmas in criminal concerns ? No general answer emerges when you go down the list and see the names of so many famous American businesses . Over the long term , who would ever bet against DuPont , a great name on Fortune 's " Roster of Wrongdoing " ? ( You 'd expect that title from Ralph Nader but never Time , Inc. , which , by the by , is on it through a subsid ? iary involved in the great price-fixing case in the fold ? ing carton industry . ) US Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to US Steal , from the investor 's point of view that corporate headquarters in Pitts ? burgh is still a turkey roost . On a case by case basis , no one industry group seems to dominate the roster , so let 's arbitrarily start with the three- and four-time losers , the corporations that would , if they were flesh and blood and not legal fictions , be called recidivists . Take Braniff Interna ? tional : four trips to court in the last 10 years in cases involving slush funds and criminal restraint of trade . Although the company president and his glamorous wife , the head of a well-known New York advertising agency , frequently make it into the gossip columns , the airline looks like it is flying straight into the Rocky Mountains . It is almost three quarters of a billion dollars in debt , not always a terrible thing for airlines , except that Braniff is losing money on its operations and is selling off the planes in its fleet to make ends meet . Of course that can only go on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not paying dividends , needless to add . Braniff is a victim of free enterprise and its man ? agement 's bad judgment . When the Civil Aeronautics Board emancipated airlines from route regulation , Braniff , absent any very well thought-out market stud ? ies , expanded and expanded at great cost and little revenue . Perhaps management was too busy with its lawyers trying to stay out of jail Anyhow , in Braniff 's case , crime not only did n't pay , it may have contributed to its deficit , Another four-time loser is the Gulf Oil Company . No corporation has been in trouble more frequently for more serious offenses in the last decade than Gulf . Maybe this is the institutional curse for being a Mellon family-controlled company for so long . Who knows whether they recruit gonifs or spot them in the organi ? zation and promote them or what , but they 've been nailed on rigging uranium prices , giving illegal gifts to an IRS agent , and slush funds for political naughtiness on a scale you would n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major international oil power , has been on the decline . Herybody 's BUSinIfS5 , new , very useful , and readable almanac on corporate America edited by Milton Moskowitz ( Harper &; Row ) , demotes Gulf from its long-held place as one of the Seven Sisters of big oil because it has done so poorly in comparison to outfits like Exxon in recent years . Its dividend is nothing Dean Witter would call good news and the price of the stock has been decidedly pokey , as has everything else about Gulf in recent years . The causes are complex but the company 's worst problem ? for the moment forgetting Mellonafactors in the executive suite ? has involved getting pushed out of its stupendously profitable Middle East hold ? ings . Exploration to compensate has n't pulled in much , leaving Gulf stuck with oil reserves in North America that are expensive to pump out of the ground . None ? theless , this may be a stock for gamblers . The shares are selling for for less than they would if the company closed down and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not the real reason for considering a flyer on Gulf , Starting around March or April , or even as late as May , a screaming oil shortage should develop . Lines in front of the gas stations , and so on . Consumption will have outrun supply , especially supply from the Middle East . Asa consequence , companies with reserves , regardless of how expensive , in safe places like North America are going to look very , very good . It is then that the company 's stock , which has been wandering around at about 4B bucks a share , may take off . If that happens , sell once the stock gets up to about $85 a share . Stock prices shoot up fastest and highest not on real profits , but on anticipation , on dreams . So cash in on other people 's dreams and move your money on to more interesting places . For reasons not readily apparent to your Fool , the beverage business appears to have run afoul of the law more frequently than a number of other industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One that decidedly did n't is Schlitz Beer . Laverne and Shir ? ley have left Milwaukee , and the beer that made the town famous is having a terrible time . Once the nation 's top seller , Schlitz sinks , sinks , and sinks . The management , whatever its problems with the Justice Department , appears vigorous , intelligent , and hus ? tling , but the beer just do n't sell no more . Another outfit with a lot of legal problems in the last three years is Seagrams , the whiskey people . They 're doing all right , but the dividend on the stock is lousy and its price is high . Definitely a no buy . More interesting is PepsiCo , whose Monsieur Henri subsidiary pleaded guilty last year to bribing a union official , and Anheuser-Busch , which got into trouble with making payments to customers , apparently a fre ? quent practice in the beer business . Both of these are buy possibilities for persons who want to gamble , but not too much . These are both safe stocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if you buy it around $25 a share , is worth the speculation . In the last five years it 's never dropped below $17.50 and it 's frequently gotten giddy and gone flitting up into the high 20s and low 30s . The beer business is not going to Klondike on us and explode . Its what they call a " mature " industry , mean ? ing the trick in this case is to hold un to your customers or steal them away from your competitors , something the makers of the King of Beers are very good at . Aside from that , what makes Busch attractive is they 've beaten back the challenge from Miller High Life ? / do n't care how entertaining those TV commercials are ? and soon should be able to raise their prices and ergo their profits . The PepsiCo proposition is n't quite as alluring , This . o stock the boys and girls on Wall Street used to love , but the affair has ended with a lot of criticism about some of PepsiCo 's troubled subsidiaries , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their drive and mer ? chandising ability . The less-than-Avis of soda pop has cut the Coca-Cola dominance and its once-great lead it sales so dramatically that it could become Numero Unc itself in the next few years . Coke has become the old fogies ' drink , but that 's also the one drawback Pepsi has . As the population ages , America is getting old ? fogy-ized . For gray-haired people who have to pause to be refreshed , Coke may be their drink . If you have n't done so by the time you read this , talk to your tax person immediately about last-minute moves to cut what you owe . That means it 's dog-dump ? ing time . Get rid of those losers , those bad picks among your investments . Only after you 've shot the dogs , euthanasiadzed the kitties , qualified for your tax toss , and burrowed into your tax shelter , should you exhale and join the Fool in wishing all a happy holiday and a very , very prosperous New Year . When Ford Motor Company decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cen ? ter in Florida , the affair was expected to be an hour of triumph . The National Aeronautics and Space Admin ? istration had set December 4 as the date for the launch of the most powerful communications satellite in his ? tory , built by Ford 's aerospace subsidiary . What better way to illustrate Ford 's imagination , engineering su ? periority , and commitment to technological progress ? What better way to polish the image of a corporation tarnished by huge financial losses , million-dollar law ? suits arising out of dangerously defective Ford prod ? ucts , and an embarrassing inability to fend off a com ? petitive challenge from Japan ? So the invitations went out to hundreds of journalists all over the world to come and witness Ford 's ascent into the heavens . And it would n't cost them or their employers a cent : Ford would provide air fare , hotel accommodations , meals , even a free pair of Bushnell binoculars with which to view the launch . On December 3 and 4 , nearly 200 reporters , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scended upon Cocoa Beach to enjoy the hospitality of the nation 's second-biggest auto maker . Most of them were from the US , but 60 or so hailed from Africa , Asia , Europe , and Latin America ? places where Ford cars are as well known as at home . The reporters were provided a hearty lunch at the Holiday Inn , given the chance to hear and question the chairman of Ford and the president of its aerospace subsidiary , and escorted through an afternoon tour of the space center . Finally , as night fell , they were loaded onto buses , driven across the bridge to Cape Canaveral , and deposited only a few hundred yards away from the launch pad , where a huge white rocket , gleaming in the flood ? lights , stood waiting to be catapulted into the sky . But Ford 's triumph was not to be . After one postponement and more than an hour of waiting , NASA announced that because of a minor mechanical problem the launch had been postponed , at least until the next evening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press were loaded back onto the buses and transported back to the Holiday Inn for a cocktail party and a gloomy evening of drinking , accompanied by a vaguely Hawaiian musical troupe . Most of the journal ? ists left the next day , as originally planned , and only a handful hung around until Saturday evening , when the launch finally took place . Ford 's executives may be forgiven for any doubts they have about the existence of a just God . Certainly the company is long overdue for a triumph , having had hardly anything but setbacks in the last three years . Last year Ford lost a quarter of a billion dollars , and this year its losses on North American car and truck sales will exceed a billion and a half dollars . The com ? pany is living under the threat of being ordered to recall 16 million vehicles to repair an alleged defect which causes the transmission to slip from park to reverse . Ford already has lost several lawsuits over injuries and deaths caused by cars backing over people . The widower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punitive damages . If the recall is ordered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , it would be the biggest and most expensive recall ever , with a price tag of as high as $000 million . Coming on the heels of the highly publi ? cized scandal involving Ford 's knowing failure to fix a defect in the gas tanks of its Pinto line , the recall also might badly damage Ford 's reputation among con- sumers . The question reporters at Cape Canaveral asked each other , though , was why a corporation losing bil ? lions of dollars would throw away good money to entertain and impress the news media . Until this year , the annual press conference had been held in Detroit , with somewhat less fanfare . Certainly there is nothing in your introductory economics textbook to explain the incongruity . Ford is no Chrysler , but there is a genuine chance that it too could be forced to the brink of bankruptcy , and not in the distant future . By all logic the company should be ruthlessly eliminating every hne in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly wining and dining reporters should be high on the cut list . Judged by conventional economic logic , the whole self-promoting conclave makes no sense . What they do n't tell you in Economics 1 , however , is that once the modern corporation reaches late middle age , it becomes as much a political institution as an economic one . It serves several purposes deemed useful by the state
