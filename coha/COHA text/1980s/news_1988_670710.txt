Doctors at the gathering called the decision irresponsible , given the reduced rate of complications for women using the drug compared with those having surgical abortions and the suffering and deaths of tens of thousands of women each year as a result of poorly performed procedures. // The decision , which the company said was made because of pressure from anti-abortion groups , dominated events at today ' s meeting of the World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics , which is being attended by close to 9 , 500 doctors and medical experts . <> <> Researcher Criticizes Company // Outspoken critics of the decision included representatives of the World Health Organization , the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation and practicing physicians and university professors from such nations as India , the United States , Britain and France. // Among them was Dr. Etienne Baulieu , the French medical researcher for Groupe Roussel Uclaf who developed the drug , known as RU 486 . Dr. Baulieu said Roussel had given in to intolerance . He called its decision " morally scandalous. " // Officials of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk with Roussel executives to urge them to change their mind . Barring that , they said , they will seek ways for another company or a nonprofit organization to produce and distribute RU 486 , for which Roussel has the patent . In Paris , company officials said they would consider reversing their decision if public pressure against the drug died down . Page A9 Researchers Present Findings Dr. Baulieu said that he spoke with Roussel ' s president , Edouard Sakiz , on Tuesday , the day the company ' s board voted to suspend distribution of the drug . " He told me he hopes there is pressure to counteract the decision , " Dr. Baulieu said . The main meeting hall spilled over today as an international panel of researchers involved in the development and testing of RU 486 presented its findings on the compound , which it described as effective and safe. // During the session , doctors collected more than 1 , 000 signatures on a petition urging Roussel to make the drug ' s patent available to " an appropriate entity to insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <> <> ' Everybody Is Incensed ' // " Everybody is incensed by this ; I had not one person refuse , " said Dr. Luigi Mastroianni , professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania , who was holding a stack of petitions . " I am not pro-abortion . These people are not abortionists . They are doctors concerned with the health care of women . The withdrawal of this extremely useful compound is entirely inappropriate. " // One group , which included American and European university professors , said it was preparing a list of Roussel ' s products and would ask physicians to boycott them . It also said that it was planning a protest campaign that would include placing advertisements in newspapers and sending letters to Hoechst A.G. , the West German chemical company that owns 54. 5 percent of Roussel. // " Medical groups and family planning clinics should protest the decision to show that we too have a voice , not only the right-to-life groups , " one professor said. // The panel of scientists who worked with the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britain and India , reported that the compound might have uses other than terminating pregnancy . Among the uses cited were the ending of ectopic pregnancy , the bringing on of labor , treatment of cancer of the breast and , in men , of the prostate . <> <> ' A Serious Mistake ' // " I think the company made a serious mistake , " said Dr. Fred T. Sai , senior population adviser to the World Bank . " At the bank we were very interested in the research . This scientific finding holds promises for a number of treatments , including more humane treatment of abortion. " // The Roussel announcement had all the more effect here because the congress had begun a broad debate on maternal deaths in developing countries . In an address , Dr. Allan Rosenfield , dean of the Columbia University School of Public Health in New York , urged doctors to take steps to end the " epidemic " of deaths of young women in their child-bearing years. // According to the World Health Organization , 500 , 000 women die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as 200 , 000 of those deaths were due to botched abortions. // " This is a tragic decision , " he said of the suspension of RU 486 . " Here is a method which the world has sought for so long , one that might make safe abortions more accessible and prevent so many unnecessary deaths . Now it has been driven from the market by what amounts to a business decision. " // Doctors appeared most angered by what they saw as an infringement of politics on what they regard as sound and necessary medical practices. // " It is not usual in the development of a new medical therapy that an entirely new product becomes available , " said Dr. Sheldon Segal , director of the Rockefeller Foundation ' s program of population and human reproduction . " Paradoxically , we are now in a situation in which a very beneficial new product , carefully developed and registered by two countries , has been withdrawn for considerations other than medical ones . This drug may not be available to us due to an emotional debate. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so far officially licensed the use of the drug . Delegates from China could not be reached for comment. // An official of the World Health Organization said Roussel was contractually obliged to turn over research on the drug to it if the company failed to develop it further. // Medical experts here said that other laboratories were working on a similar drug that might become available before long. //
