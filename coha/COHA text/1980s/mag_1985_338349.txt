Until a few weeks ago , Nesselwang 's worst fate was being inundated by thousands of skiers every winter . Now the tranquillity of the small Bavarian town is being threatened by visitors of another kind : veterans of two SS divisions , who intend to hold reunions there . The town council did not disguise its unhappiness with those plans but stressed that it could do nothing because the veterans ' groups are legally entitled to meet . In protest , however , the town band has refused to play for the gathering . For their part , leaders of the two SS " old comrades ' associations " insisted last week that they were getting together only for organizational reasons , including continued efforts to trace some 150,000 SS troopers missing since World War II . SS veterans ' associations have been finding it more and more difficult to meet of late . Last year the 1st Armored Corps Association had to call off a reunion in Bad Harzburg when demonstrations erupted and a local court banned the meeting . Veterans of the 3rd SS Armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hessian hills , but so did 5,000 anti- Nazi demonstrators and 700 helmeted police . The welcome in Nesselwang is not expected to be much friendlier : an anti-SS rally has been scheduled for next week .
