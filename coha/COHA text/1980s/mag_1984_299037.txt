For the athletes , the competition is the thing <P> Spectators might say , " It 's only a game , " and they should say it , 20 times a day . But can a building contractor ever say , " It 's only a house " ? To the world 's athletes , the Olympics are not merely sport , and their reactions to the Soviet withdrawal ranged from a sigh to a bolt of anger . " The hell with them , " said Al Oerter , a U.S. discus thrower with four Olympiads and four gold medals under his broad belt . Willie Banks , the triple jumper , called the Olympics " the biggest political football in the history of man , " and Marathoner Alberto Salazar despaired , " It 's going to be the death blow for the Games . It has happened too many years . " <P> While political interruptions at the Olympics trace at least to Hitler and probably to Zeus , Munich in 1972 is where innocence died , along with eleven others . " If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , " said Avery Brundage , the Olympic politician , " there would never be Games . " When he decreed that terrorists should not be allowed to spoil the fun , and let the Games resume , public opinion was divided . But the athletes were agreed : by all means , play on . Physically , emotionally and materially , they had sacrificed too much . <P> For then and always , their position was expressed most simply by Olga Connolly , a discus thrower who carried the U.S. flag in Munich 's opening procession . And she could speak from both sides of the curtain . As a member of the Czechoslovak team in 1956 , Olga Fikotova fell for American Hammer Thrower Harold Connolly , and against those two , red tape never had a chance . " On the day my mother died , " she said that bleak afternoon in Bavaria , " I still had to do my housework . " Training is that basic to them . <P> When he heard the thunder last week , U.S. Swimmer Jesse Vassallo felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was Vladimir Salnikov , " he said , referring to the dashing Soviet champion of two Olympic events . " I swam with that guy , trained with him . I know how hard he had to work to maintain what he had . My God , he must feel so empty . " Salnikov , the swimmer . Dmitri Belozerchev , the gymnast . Sergei Bubka , the pole vaulter . Anatoli Pisa-renko , the weight lifter . These are the glamorous losses . The marvelous women swimmers from East Germany , including Birgit Meineke and Kristin Otto . Czechoslovakia 's middle-distance wonder Jarmila Kratochvilova . No Zamira Zaitseva now to tumble in the wake of Mary Decker . Zaitseva is a Soviet , but the other East bloc countries constitute the grievous loss to track and field . Women 's track is becoming something of another East German preserve .
