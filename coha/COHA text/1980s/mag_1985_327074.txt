Rarely , apart from assassinations of the famous , has the act of a single anonymous person caused such a stir . Mild-mannered Bernhard Goetz gets on a New York City subway . Four young toughs surround him , asking first for a match , next a cigarette , then $5 . He pulls a gun , shoots them all , two in the back . He runs away , then nine days later turns himself in . The town goes wild for him . Dubbed the subway vigilante , he is the talk , the toast , of every radio call-in show from Miami to San Diego . The outpouring of popular support becomes a story in itself . Mayors , Governors and editorialists express dismay . <P> How can good , decent citizens react this way ? <P> The short answer is rage , directed first at Goetz 's harassers . It is hard for anyone to muster much sympathy for them or their Miranda rights . The loathing for these villains/victims is universal . Columnist Jimmy Breslin says it is because of race . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be some truth to that , but it does not begin to explain things . Millions of blacks and Hispanics ride the New York subways . Interviews with most show them to be as sympathetic to Goetz and as hostile to his attackers as whites . <P> Curtis Sliwa , leader of the Guardian Angels , gives a better clue . Interrupting a string of choice entomological epithets by which he characterizes the " muggers , " he observes that they were not stealing for food . The $5 they wanted was to play video games . <P> This is violence of a special kind , not " brother , can you spare a dime " stuff but anarchic , pointless , Clockwork Orange violence . It is particularly reviled because it is perfectly senseless . We tend to call serial murders senseless , but we know that buried deep inside a Wayne Williams lies a horrible , though perhaps unfathomable , purpose . We suspect a reason , some powerful , twisted logic . Anomic violence , on the other hand , is truly senseless . Thus crimes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Jean Valjean 's ) sympathy ; but crimes for fun , for a video game , for no purpose , elicit rage . John Hinckley Jr . did more damage in a minute than these four combined had done in a lifetime . But there could be no satisfaction in blowing him away . Blow these four away , and you are ready to run for mayor . <P> The other object of rage is the New York subway , and the authorities for permitting it to deteriorate to its current sinister , menacing state . The New York subway is a place where the rules nominally apply , but only nominally . The problem is more than the breakdown of law . It is the breakdown of order . " The absolute amount of serious subway crime is small  --  38 reported felonies per day , " editorializes the New York Times . " The larger problem " is " graffiti , vandalism , harassing passengers for handouts . The pervasiveness of that mischief generates fear that a system millions must ride has slipped out of control . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year are the lesser problem . People are upset .
