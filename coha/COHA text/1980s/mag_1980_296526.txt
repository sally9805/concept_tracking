The Protestant right gets down to political fundamentals <P> When he was nine years old , John B. Anderson knelt at an Illinois tent revival and committed his life to Jesus . During 19 years in Congress he has been one of the most articulate Evangelicals in politics . Jimmy Carter 's well-publicized faith made " born again " a famous phrase . And Ronald Reagan ? In February he told a TV interviewer that he is born again , too , but seemed shaky about the Evangelical concept of personal belief , concluding , " I suppose I would qualify . " <P> Obviously Fundamentalists and Evangelicals who want to mix religion and politics would favor Carter or Anderson , right ? Wrong . The most vocal ones , at least , find Reagan 's conservatism almost irresistible . Says Richard Zone , executive director of a new political lobby called Christian Voice : " Reagan is not the best Christian that ever walked the face of the earth , but we really do n't have a choice . " His group slaps Anderson with a zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them abortion , school prayer , a balanced budget and strong national defense . Christian Voice regards Carter as a " good man " but " naive " and with dreaded liberal tendencies . Ted Kennedy is unthinkable . But the once divorced and remarried movie actor checks out fine . <P> Religion in politics is no novelty in America . Hardly an eyebrow was raised when the national head of Reform Judaism endorsed Senator Kennedy even before the primaries . But Protestant Evangelicals have generally judged politics to be the devil 's playground . This year they are plunging in , too , borrowing methods and single-issue zeal that religious and secular liberals have applied to racial equality , women 's rights , the environment and the Viet Nam War . Their booming religious TV and radio circuit provides a " bully " pulpit for exploring moral issues . The effect on a close presidential race could be crucial . <P> There are 31 million Evangelicals of voting age , whose ranks include all political views . Today a quartet of interlocking groups urged on by secular New Right activists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to register millions of inactive churchgoers , deliver votes on a national and local level and provide chosen candidates with campaign workers and cash . The four : <P> Christian Voice . Zone , 30 , and other California pastors got their political start by rallying behind a 1978 state referendum to bar openly homosexual schoolteachers . Since going national last year they have broadened their targets to include school busing and the Panama Canal treaty McAteer ( against ) , Taiwan security and prosecution of welfare deadbeats ( for ) . Three U.S. Senators and eleven Congressmen form an advisory committee . In its first year , the group claims to have enlisted 187,000 supporters , a fifth of them clergy , and it plans to spend $3 million in 1980 . Voice has no tax exemption so it can be openly political . Campaign flyers will go to 5 million people . Supporters are currently being mailed " morality " voting records on all Congressmen and a " hit list " of undesirable incumbents . A subsidiary , Christians for Reagan , has earmarked $1 million to be spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *
