At Last , Time for Healing the Wounds <P> It was over . At last , after so many months of poisonous suspicion , a kind of undeclared civil war that finally engaged all three branches of the American Government , the ordeal had ended . As the Spirit of 76 in one last errand arced across central Missouri carrying Richard Nixon to his retirement , Gerald Rudolph Ford stood in the East Room of the White House , placed his hand upon his eldest son 's Bible , and repeated the presidential oath " to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . " By the time the 37th President of the U.S. arrived at the Pacific , the 38th President had taken command . <P> It was the first time in American history that a President had resigned his office . The precedent was melancholy , but it was hardly traumatic . All of the damage had been done before in the seemingly interminable spectacle of high officials marched through courtrooms , in the recitation of burglaries , crooked campaign contributions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , in the ugly but mesmerizing suspense as the investigations drew closer and closer to the Oval Office . Now the dominant emotion throughout the nation was one of sheer relief . <P> A few of Nixon 's last supporters still summoned up bitterness . Not a few Americans cracked open bottles of champagne . Mostly , the nation was massively grateful to have it ended . As Ford said at his swearing-in , " Our long national nightmare is over . " By his leaving , Nixon seemed at last to redeem the 1968 pledge he took from a girl holding up a campaign sign in Ohio : BRING US TOGETHER . <P> The denouement was jarring in its swift resolution and therefore a bit surreal . Nearly 800 days after the Watergate breakin , 289 days after the Saturday Night Massacre , 97 days after the White House transcripts were released , twelve days after the Supreme Court voted , 8 to 0 , that the President must surrender 64 more tapes , five days after the House Judiciary Committee voted out articles of impeachment , Nixon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , 1972 , transcript that amounted to a confession to obstruction of justice and to lying to the American people . With that his clock had run out . <P> His televised resignation speech was a peculiar performance . In some ways , it sounded like a State of the Union address , a recitation of his achievements . He admitted no guilt , only casually did he mention mistakes made " in the best interests of the nation . " If some expected a bitter , angry valedictory , Nixon was controlled and ultimately conciliatory . Nixon once said that the test of a people is the way it handles the transition of power , and last week-in his resignation speech if not in his mawkish , self-pitying White House goodbye-he deserved credit for helping to bring off the transition with dignity in what must have been the most painful moment of his life .
