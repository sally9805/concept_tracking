Question : What do 3,614 journalists do in a picturesque Swiss city when a couple of bigwig visitors declare a news blackout ? Answer : They pester government spokesmen about whether Ronald Reagan was secretly recording his talks with Mikhail Gorbachev ( no ) and how Nancy Reagan coped with the cold ( long underwear ) . In this summit of images , the quintessential picture of the press may have been the pack that gathered around the President as he walked into a reception held by the Swiss government . " Have you agreed on anything ? " they shouted . " Ca n't say , " Reagan replied puckishly , throwing up his hands in mock despair . <P> If the Geneva summit did not set a press attendance record ( 14,000 covered last year 's Democratic Convention in San Francisco , for example ) , it probably rates at least an asterisk for the most reporters and technicians on hand to collect the least news . The event also marked Moscow 's most ambitious effort yet to get its message across to the world media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-honed communication skills , the Soviets set up shop a week before the summit at the International Conference Center , a concrete-block house dubbed " the bunker " and home to the non-U.S . journalists . The 55-man operation included a dozen high-powered experts fluent in English and led by well-known America Watcher Georgi Arbatov , head of the Institute for the Study of the U.S.A. and Canada . Besides providing twice-daily briefings that began several days before the two leaders arrived in Geneva , Arbatov &; Co. mingled with journalists and appeared on the three U.S. television networks and CNN to offer official wisdom on topics ranging from ICBMs to Soviet Jews . " In the West the Soviet Union 's situation is not known or is known incorrectly , " explained Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Lomeiko . " There are two reasons for this . We do not explain our position well enough , and certain circles misrepresent our purposes . " <P> Yet Lomeiko soon discovered that an open press policy can bring embarrassing questions . During a Sunday session in the cavernous briefing room , Irina Grivnina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only last month , started yelling about political prisoners . The next day , when Swiss officials told Grivnina to leave as Lomeiko began his briefing , she angrily refused , pointing out her credentials as a reporter for the weekly Dutch magazine Elseviers . Grivnina 's shouts attracted a stampede of reporters . Lomeiko , fuming about " people who use this for their own purposes , " could barely be heard above the din . " It 's either this woman or it 's me , " he shouted . " I warn you ! " Finally , Lomeiko stalked out of the room , but not before cameras had captured the scene for the evening news . <P> The Soviet p.r . offensive , which seemed aimed primarily at European newsmen , drew mixed reviews . " I have never seen this before , " marveled Marcella van der Wiel , a reporter for Amsterdam 's De Telegraaf . " The Soviets ask how they can help you . " Yet most journalists saw a change only in tone , not in message . ' ' Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amalric of Paris ' Le Monde . " But it is the same old speech . "
