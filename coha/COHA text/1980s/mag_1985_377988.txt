They toil at a summer 's game in sweatshops that are green and airy . The rank-and-filer earns an average of $363,000 a year , not counting shaving-cream endorsements . A major-league baseball player is hardly your typical working stiff . <P> No wonder , then , that the fans were loudly unsympathetic when the athletes ' union went on strike last week . " The players are greedy , " groused St. Louis Cardinal Rooter Greg Errion . " They have no regard for the fans . It 's ' What can I get for me today ? ' The luster of ballplayers as American heroes has dulled . " Nor did the fans feel very sorry for the owners , who , despite their poor-mouthing , toss about millions of dollars , largely , it sometimes seems , for the privilege of hanging about their employees ' locker room . <P> Perhaps it was the boos and catcalls that made the players and the owners settle so quickly . Or the coolly persuasive presence of Peter Ueberroth , the former Olympic czar turned baseball commissioner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or the sheer cost of the walkout : on average , $2,000 a day in salary per athlete , $1.17 million a day in revenue per owner . In any case , the players had barely finished packing up their gloves and blow-dryers to head home last week when word filtered out that the strike was over . By Thursday , two days after the lights had gone out at ball parks across the country , the cracking bats and beery roar of major-league baseball again filled the muggy August air . Boston Bartender Michael Shain approved . " People do n't want to read about contract and salary disputes in the sports section , " said Shain , who manages the Batter 's Box near Fenway Park . " It was the one place in the paper where those things could be avoided . " <P> Though the strike was fought over such accountants ' terrain as TV-revenue shares and profit-loss sheets , the real issue was the shifting balance of power between the players and the owners . For about a century the players were professional gladiators , glorified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but held in bondage by the owners . Until the early ' 70s , players had little alternative to taking what was offered except to become a holdout . Salaries were relatively low , even for established stars . In 1954 M.V.P. Willie Mays earned $25,000 , about the equivalent of what a utility infielder makes in today 's dollars . <P> Then in 1973 players won the right to submit salary disputes to an independent arbitrator . The arbitrator was compelled to choose either the club 's offer or the player 's demand , and salaries inevitably rose . True deliverance came two years later , when players won freedom from the so-called reserve clause that tied them to one team for as long as the owner wanted them . Now players with six years ' experience could in a sense sell themselves to the highest bidder . The combination of arbitration and free agency sent salaries spiraling sevenfold in less than a decade , from an average of $44,000 in 1975 to more than $360,000 this year . <P> The clubs ' annual revenues in the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talks got under way nine months ago , owners began pleading that they could not afford the salary race . Forecasting losses of $90 million a year by 1988 and warning that major-league baseball was in jeopardy , they demanded that the players follow the example of the once fiscally battered National Basketball Association and establish a cap on salaries .
