In 17 outings at the Indianapolis 500 , Gordon Johncock , 45 , had been stymied by broken crankshafts , flat tires , dry gas tanks and fuel-pump failures . His one earlier Indy win , in 1973 , had come in a race that was stopped by rain after 332.5 miles . " It seems throughout my career , " he says , " that it has n't been meant for me to run 500 miles . " This year Johncock managed to hold on for a full-length victory , though the jaws of defeat were snapping close behind . With 13 laps left , Johncock 's STP Wildcat-Cosworth was 12 sec. ahead of the second-place car , a Penske-Ford driven by Rick Wears , 30 . Then Mears began closing in , gaining almost a second a lap . Johncock kept thinking desperately , " Is it going to stay together ? Is it going to stay together ? " It did , and he did , but only narrowly . He won by a mere .16 sec. in the closest finish in the Brickyard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to savor the $290,609 victory . After the race , he flew to Hastings , Mich. , and the hospital bedside of his comatose mother Frances , 77 . Hours later , she died , never having learned of her son 's triumph . <P> Somewhere along the way , Anita Morris has surely completed Broadway 's decathlon . She scaled a 50-ft. wall in the original production of Jesus Christ Superstar , performed an acrobatic dance routine in Seesaw , and was sawed in half by The Magic Show 's Doug Henning , then stuffed into a cage with a 200-lb. cougar . In the current Broadway hit Nine , Morris gives new meaning to the phrase physical-fitness buff . In one number , A Call from the Vatican , she does a feline , erotic exercise for which she is so barely dressed in such sheer black that she has worn through three costumes in six weeks . Her performance was to have been part of Sunday night 's Tony Awards on CBS , but when network censors took in A Call from the Vatican , they said sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puts Anita into attire more in keeping with Sunday-night fare : a nun 's habit . <P> Boy , dear diary , you land a good job in Washington and all of a sudden everyone wants to talk to you . It 's sort of embarrassing , but when David Letterman called-you know , the host of Late Night on NBC-what could I say ? I mean , David , he 's so ahhhh . I 'm 14 now , so it was O.K. for me to go to New York with my brother Jeff 's wife Annette and my two Secret Service escorts , who follow me everywhere . I wore this new black dress that I had just bought , and everyone thought I looked pretty grownup . I was a little shy at first , but David was nice , and he asked me if I ever did anything bad in the White House , and I told him about the time I carved my initials in my windowsill . So then he calls Mom right on the show ! ! ! Gross , right ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dress ( which she has n't seen yet ) , and she tells him that she likes my white one back home . In front of everybody ! ! ! Then he tells her about my initials on the windowsill . I could have croaked . I 'll tell you more about my summer job as a Senate page later , since nothing has really happened here yet , except that one Senator asked me to pick him up some peanuts . Ha . Ha . I think they are a little funnier in New York . <P> - Amy
