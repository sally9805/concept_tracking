Athens is a frequent layover point for plane trips from the United States or Europe to Africa , the Middle East , and the Far East . I ' ve paused in the ancient Greek center several times , always on the way to or from someplace else , never leaving the airport , never seeing the city ' s major sights. // On my most recent trip through , however , I was determined to quit the airport lounge and glimpse the Acropolis . I had four hours between my airplane arrival and cruise ship departure . This , I discovered , was enough time to take a cab to the historic ruins , climb about the marble pillars that stand notably high above the city , explore the hilltop museum that sits in the Parthenon ' s shadow , and even relax for half an hour in a cafe at the foot of the Acropolis before heading to the port . I do not recommend this as the way to see Athens , but it is certainly one way to enjoy a four-hour stopover to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city ' s most famous feature. // // A word of warning before I offer the details of this pleasant whirlwind : On Tuesdays you can admire the Acropolis only from afar , as it is closed . Every other weekday ( 9 : 30 a. m. to 4 p. m. ) and Sunday ( 10 a. m. to 3 p. m. ) it is open . You can get there from the airport cab stand in under 20 minutes for less than $4 . ( It ' s wise to negotiate the fee with your driver before climbing into his cab . ) He ' ll probably offer to wait for you while you tour , but that ' s not necessary , for at the base of the Acropolis you can easily hail another cab for your return trip to the airport. // The cab ride will take you through modern Athens . But well before you are dropped off at the Acropolis , you will see that ancient landmark rise hauntingly in the distance , luring you back in time , a vivid contrast to the skyscrapers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab , you ' ll walk up a wide cobblestone pathway to the third-century Beule Gate , and you ' ll pay just over $1 ( 150 drachmas ) to enter the renowned heart of old Greece . Don ' t expect to have the place to yourself . From April through November , you ' ll find crowds of other travelers wearing cameras like necklaces , and traipsing around in shorts and sunshirts under a glorious blue sky . From December to March , the crowds are pleasantly smaller and primarily Greek , but there is a good possibility of chilly , wet air . The miracle of this site , however , is that no matter how small or large the crowds or how wet or dry the day , it is equipped to carry you back 2 , 500 years and stir your imagination and senses with its beauty. // Ancient Greek cities were frequently built around fortified hills , and this citadel was one of several acropolises ( ' ' high towns ' ' ) of its day , such as Corinth and Thebes . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptured atop a 10-acre mesa-like rock , 300 feet high and crowned with the sublime Parthenon. // To enter the Acropolis , you stretch your legs on steep , time-worn steps up to the monumental Propylaea , a once-roofed limestone threshold still marked by its original facade of six doric columns of white marble . For a thousand years , the first thing people encountered after passing through this entrance was a colossal bronze statue of the virgin goddess Athena , daughter of Zeus and guardian of the city . In AD 6th century , she was carted off to Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) . All that is left of her today is the base on which she stood . Consequently , the visitor ' s eye goes right to the Parthenon , which stands on the highest point of the rock , its fluted columns rising into the blue to hold up a ceiling no longer there. // Like the Propylaea , the Parthenon was designed by and constructed under the direction of the masterful artist Phidias , often referred to as ' ' the greatest sculptor of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 5th-century BC victory over the Persians , Phidias was commissioned by his friend Pericles , head of the powerful Athenian city-state , to build a temple to the virgin goddess Athena . It was Pericles ' s intention that the temple would stand through the ages as a symbol of thanksgiving for the liberty Athena bestowed upon her people . He named the magnificent building ' ' the virgin ' s place , ' ' that is ' ' the Parthenon , ' ' and after 2 , 500 years it still stands. // Just north of the Parthenon lies the Erechtheum Temple , noted for its caryatid maidens - six elegant doric figures gracefully supporting the south porch roof of the temple . Recently , it was discovered that air pollution has decayed these stone maidens alarmingly , so they have // been replaced with fiberglass replicas. // Magnificent as it is , what is before you is but a hint of what once was . The bulk of the masterful sculptures that once graced this high town were stolen , destroyed , or purchased centuries ago. // Missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and ivory statue of the goddess Athena . Sculptured by Phidias himself for an elaborate chamber in the Parthenon , it was considered the chief treasure of ancient Athens. // Also missing since the early 19th century are the famed Elgin marbles , including sculptures that originally decorated the pediments of the Parthenon . These exquisite carvings were purchased in 1806 for $370 , 000 by the British ambassador to Constantinople , Lord Elgin . In 1816 , he sold them to the British Museum for $175 , 000 , in the face of bitter controversy about their artistic value and his right to remove them from Athens . To this day there is a movement in Greece to have them returned from London to Athens. // Some of the surviving Acropolis sculptures are harbored in the cool shadows of a small museum at the eastern end of the Parthenon . Here you can see the winged Nike that once graced the balustrade of the Athena Nike Temple , built alongside the Propylaea to honor the goddess of victory . There are plaster models of the east and west pediments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliefs from the friezes that decorated the Parthenon ' s interior . And , important to those of us who are only passing through , here you can buy a catalog that you can turn to later to tell you what you ' ve seen. // If your stroll through the museum is not too leisurely , you will have time to drink in a breathtaking view or two from your sky-high vantage point . Southwest you ' ll see the Odeon , an 8 , 000-seat open-air theater built by the Greek poet Herodes Atticus in AD 161 and still used for the Athens summer festival of drama and music . Southeast is the 330 BC Theatre of Dionysos , honoring the Greek Patron of Drama who , like Athena , was the child of Zeus . Beyond that is the Temple of Zeus , the Greeks ' supreme god , son of Father Time himself ( Titan Cronus ) . Northeast is the famed placka , the oldest inhabited section of Athens . It is a marvelous maze of skinny streets , small squares , churches , cafes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if you are in Athens on a Tuesday when the Acropolis is closed , you might want to visit the placka and look up at the Acropolis rather than vice versa. ) // By now it is time to hike down from the temples of the gods to the cafe nestled in the trees at the southwest foot of the Acropolis . In this arbor-bordered restaurant , you can get a hot or cool drink accompanied by a slice of baklava ( a pastry of phyllo dough , nuts , and honey ) , moussaka ( eggplant , ground beef , and a bechamel sauce ) , or gemista ( vegetables stuffed with rice in a lemon or tomato sauce ) . There is a clean restroom , where you can wash your hands and splash your face before venturing out to hail your // cab . Just cross the highway that curves between the cafe and the walkway to // the Acropolis , and start waving your hands. // Catch a cab . Catch a plane . Read your catalog. // // // //     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
