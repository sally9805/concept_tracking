His nightly imitation of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde defies adequate explanation . But that is the charm of a Larry Bird . He finds ways to help the Celtics win when lesser players might hang their heads . No one who watched Bird score 40 points , haul in 17 rebounds or dish out 7 assists in Boston ' s 134-124 victory over Detroit last night would have even suspected that he was coming off just a so-so effort against the 76ers on Friday night . Bird hit 18 of 29 shots to the delight of 15,429 . Some of them were easy , like a gim me from M.L. Carr , who simply waited for him , and Bird responded with a stuff shot . But most were vintage Bird , often with the highest degree of difficulty . If it was a shootout the Pistons were looking for last night , Bird didn ' t disappoint them . " I honestly didn ' t think my guys played all that badly tonight , " said Pistons ' coach Scotty Robinson . " But what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( Celtics ) too many extra shots ; and 2 ) , they had a guy out there on the outside who just beat us , and his name is Larry Bird . He did it to us on the last shot when we played in Boston . He did it to us tonight with the same kind of shooting . " Neither Bird nor his teammates were particularly excited by the 40-point effort by the Celtics ' third-year pro . Even though he had 19 points in the first half , it was a sneaky 40 points until you put together the fact that he also had six steals . That was the real key to the success the Celtics had against the Pistons , who with Isiah Thomas ( 22 ) and Kelly Tripucka ( 28 ) look like they ' re only a player away from serious playoff contention . The Celtics stole the ball from Detroit 16 times , 9 times in the first half alone , including 7 in the second period . Bird , Carr and Gerald Henderson had a field day after Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led at haltime , 72-65 , or pulled away in the third quarter , 90-73 , surprised no one at the Hartford Civic Center . They came to see a show and Bird and Co. gave them one . " It ' s one of the nice things about playing 82 games a year , " said Celtic coach Bill Fitch . " You see a player like Larry go 2-for-14 one night and then the same guy comes back and scores 40 points . It happens to most guys in this league , but Larry is the best . The thing that people forget about him is that he is always contributing some kind of way , and some nights he doesn ' t even shoot that much . Tonight turned out to be the night that he did everything well . He had some easy shots out there . But he also made some tough ones . " Bird hit 10 shots from 16 feet out or farther . He hit 7 more on layups , 2 killer stuff shots , and one a twisting reverse job , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant coach Don Chaney in an attempt to slow Bird down . " But I hit the first couple of shots , and I just felt good , " said Bird . " A lot of them were easy shots and they went in . Once I got my rhythm , I just shot the ball if it came to me and I was open . I don ' t put anything special on tonight ' s game . It is like the nights when I missed . The ball either goes in or not . Friday night , I tried for a little more arch and I hit the back of the rim . Tonight , I made the same adjustment and I got all net . " Bird was the Celtics ' man of the hour last night . But the key to the game proved to be the inspired play of the Celtics ' bench which made his big night possible . Carr ' s contributions in the box score amounted to 7 points , 2 assists and 3 steals . Henderson added 14 points , 3 assists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rick Robey contributed 14 points and 5 rebounds in another 23-minute stint . " That ' s the difference between a good team and one that wants to be , " said Robertson . " Their bench came in and did a fine job . We started fast but couldn ' t keep it up because we were a little tired from playing Los Angeles the night before . " We got a break when ( Robert ) Parish got into foul trouble . But Robey came in and played very well . Having M.L. Carr available now adds a new dimension to the Celtics . Both he and Henderson did a particularly good job of getting into our passing lanes in the second period , and coming up with steals . We were still in the game until then . " I think you ' ll see a big difference in the Celtics ' defense now that Carr is back . It will be more consistent , and more aggressive . They ' ll be tougher by the end of the year than they are now , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a lot of pressure . " Carr says he is enjoying his new role as a defensive guard , even though he spent most of the period when he was recovering from an injury working to be a forward . " I ' m just having fun , " he said . " Just being on the floor is fun to me , and the more time I get the better . I don ' t care where I play . If Bill wants me to take Robert ' s place at center , I ' ll do that do . " And what about the steals ? " Well , I ' ve always been an aggressive player , " said Carr . " Tonight ' s game reminded me of the 1979 season when I led the league in steals . I still think I ' m a forward , but I ' m having a tough time getting back to my old stomping ground with the kind of guys we have here . So I ' ll play where they ask me.
