Investing in research to combat an epidemic <P> It sprawls across a vast expanse on the northwestern outskirts of Moscow , a semicircular complex of 23 interconnected buildings whose cream-colored faades shine brightly in the late-fall sunshine . The sparkle is only fitting , because this is the crown jewel of Soviet academic medicine : the new headquarters of the eight-year-old U.S.S.R. Cardiology Research Center . American specialists got their first view of the buildings ' endless white corridors and advanced diagnostic equipment last year , shortly after the new medical complex opened , when the Soviet Union played host to more than 5,000 physicians from around the globe , who were attending the Ninth World Congress of Cardiology . Says one impressed visitor , Harvard Heart Specialist Bernard Lown : " It is a cardiology city . " With pardonable pride , the center 's director , Yevgeni Chazov , declares , " I do n't think there 's another institute in the world that has as many functions . " <P> Why would the Soviet Union want to spend 78 million rubles ( about $117 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet epidemic of heart disease . As in the U.S. , cardiovascular diseases are the U.S.S.R. 's No. 1 killer . In America over the past decade the death rate from stroke has fallen 37% and from heart attacks it has dropped by 25% , largely owing , many cardiologists believe , to an aggressive program for the treatment of hypertension . By contrast , the Soviet death rate from heart-related diseases more than doubled between 1960 and 1980 . Among the causes , according to U.S. researchers : rampant alcoholism , smoking , and the stress resulting from crowded urban living conditions . <P> The focus of the center 's research is understanding the development of arteriosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) , a condition that can lead to strokes and heart attacks . Director Chazov and his team of scientists have developed several compounds to dissolve potentially fatal blood clots . One such compound is a more effective version of streptokinase , a drug increasingly used in the West to dissolve blood clots . <P> Using computer linkups with more than 1,000 statisticians in 20 cities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet citizens . Chazov 's prediction about the outcome of the work by Soviet scientists and researchers worldwide : " We will solve the problem of arteriosclerosis in the next ten years . Once that is done , we will be able to prevent heart attacks and strokes almost entirely and raise the life span of human beings to 80 to 85 years . " <P> American researchers who have been involved in a Soviet-U.S. medical exchange program that has been going on since 1972 generally give the Moscow institute and its researchers high marks . Others have some reservations . George Washington University Internist William Knaus , author of Inside Russian Medicine , says of the center , " Individual projects might be comparable , but overall it would not compare with Stanford , the University of Texas , Harvard or the Mayo Clinic .
