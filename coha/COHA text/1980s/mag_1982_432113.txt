 | Working Americans who are willing to start socking away cash for retirement are now getting a big new helping hand from Uncle Sam . Effective January 1 , tax breaks reward individuals who put up to $2,000 a year into a special savings plan ? known as an individual retirement account ? to build a nest egg for the future . Money put into an IRA can be invested in any number of ways ? from simply opening a savings account at a bank to trading in stocks and other securities . You can have a professional manage the money in your account or you can do it yourself . As a result , a whirlwind of bidding is under way by firms seeking to handle the flood , of investment money . Banks , savings and loan associations , mutual funds , credit unions , insurance companies and stockbrokers are all offering IRA investment plans . Some companies are setting up payroll-deduction plans for IRA contributions . Financial institutions are " fighting tooth and nail " for this money , says William Donoghue , publisher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association says more than 50 billion dollars a year could flow into IRA programs , although much of this money will come from cash earmarked anyway for investments and savings . Tax Benefits What makes IRA 's attractive are two big tax benefits The money that you contribute to an IRA is deductible from your income before calculating how much federal income tax you owe , even if you do n't itemize any other deductions . For example , a person who would otherwise have annual taxable income of $28,000 would only have $26,000 after contributing $2,000 to an IRA . For a married couple filing a joint return , that reduction means a 1982 tax saving of $580 . In effect , it costs this couple only $1,420 to make a $2,000 investment . The savings are bigger for people in higher tax brackets , smaller for people in lower tax brackets . Interest and other earnings on the IRA investment , including capital gains , accumulate without being immediately taxed . That lets the value of your IRA snowball since the balance upon which you can earn investment income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eligible Until this year , IRA 's had been limited to people who were n't covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan . Last year 's big tax-reduction bill changed that . Starting in 1982 , anyone who gets compensation from employment , including fees for professional services or income from part-time work , can set up an IRA , even if also covered by an employer 's retirement plan . An individual holding a job can put up to $2,000 a year into an IRA . Open a separate account for a nonworking spouse who does n't receive any pay during the year , and you can put away a combined total of $2,250 ? split in any ratio , but no more than $2,000 to either account . If you and your spouse both work , you can each invest up to $2,000 . If you run a business , it may pay to hire your spouse part time to allow both of you to have IRA 's . The main limit on IRA contributions is that you ca n't contribute more than what you receive in on-the-job compensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you make contributions if your only income is from interest , dividends or other non employment sources . As long as you do n't exceed the yearly ceiling on contributions , there is no limit to the number of individual IRA 's you can have . Moreover , you are not locked into an IRA . Within limits , you can close old IRA 's and open new ones , or sometimes switch the type of investment within an IRA . The tax rules do n't require you to put money in every year , and the payments you make do n't have to be in a lump sum . Some sellers of IRA investments , however , may require a minimum deposit . Self-employed persons can set up IRA 's , too , even if they also have IRAlike Keogh retirement plans . Returns You Can Get The key to benefiting from an IRA is to " start early and contribute consistently , " says Gary Strum , a vice president at E. F. Hutton &; Company , the investment firm . For example , a person who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an IRA that earns 8 percent a year compounded quarterly would accumu- late $164,000 by the time he or she reaches 65 . If the IRA earns 12 percent a year , the balance will reach almost $327,000 ; start at age 30 , and by age 65 you can have more than 1 million dollars stockpiled , even though your contributions totaled only $70 ; 000 . One New York S &L; advertises : " Retire a millionaire for just $166.66 a month . " But do n't let the gargantuan figures blind you . Behind the assumption that you can earn 12 percent a year , for instance , is an assumption that high inflation will continue . If that is so , by the time you retire , 1 million dollars wo n't be worth nearly as much as it is today . In addition , an IRA only defers tax ; it does n't exempt you from it . When you start withdrawing funds , you will be taxed on all you take out ? at regular income-tax rates . Moreover , no special favor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the sale of stock held longer than a year . Capital gains will be taxed the same as other income , rather than at the lower rate that ' normally applies . Nevertheless , financial advisers say IRA 's still shape up as a good buy . They also note that the tax bite may be eased at retirement when you presumably will be in a relatively low tax bracket because you wo n't be working . In addition , advisers say that people should start IRA 's because Social Security and private pensions can not be counted on to provide all the cash needed for retirement . Despite the hoopla , there 's no need to rush into an IRA . Though opening an IRA early this year will get you a fast start on earning tax-deferred income , you can wait until you file your 1982 tax return in 1983 to open an IRA or make a contribution to one , and still get a 1982 tax deduction . Where to Invest Many people are likely to open accounts at banks or savings and loans , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One big drawing card : Federal insurance for up to $100,000 . After your IRA tops that amount , you can open more at other banks and S &L's; to stay fully insured . IRA funds can be put into any bank or S &L; account , but most heavily promoted are certificates of deposit specifically aimed at IRA funds . They have a maturity of 18 months or more and can pay any rate of interest an institution wants , though the rate is generally linked to that paid on government and other money-market securities . Some banks in December were offering up to about 14 percent a year on such CD 's . Many institutions offer a choice : A certificate with a fixed rate or one with a rate that varies with moneymarket yields . Credit unions also may offer special IRA savings certificates . Mutual funds hope to pull in a large share of IRA accounts because of the flexibility and variety of investment that funds allow . Some investors are expected to start off with money-market funds , possibly switching later to funds investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allows its IRA clients to switch without charge between six mutual funds it manages . Included are bond , stock and money-market funds . Insurance firms offer several plans ? including annuities that guarantee a minimum income level for life after you retire . The greatest flexibility is offered by accounts you can manage yourself through a stockbroker . Merrill Lynch lists 19 investments open to its IRA clients , including stocks , bonds , U.S. securities , mutual funds , options and real-estate partnerships . Note : Deposits to an IRA must be in cash . You ca n't contribute assets , such as stocks , you already own . Also available for investment are special U.S. individual retirement bonds , available from Federal Reserve banks and the Treasury . They yield a relatively modest 9 percent a year . Specifically prohibited for new IRA investments are gold , art , antiques , diamonds , coins and other so-called collectibles . An alternative is to invest indirectly in such assets ? shares in a gold-mining firm , for example . Experts suggest you stay away from tax-exempt securities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such securities are less than on other investments and yet do n't escape tax in an IRA ? they are taxed when withdrawn . More controversial is the question of investing in stocks . Some analysts look askance at buying securities for longterm price appreciation because shares held in an IRA do n't get favorable long-term capital-gains treatment . Instead , these analysts suggest buying stocks that pay big dividends , or highyielding debt issues such as bonds and government securities , to benefit from the tax deferral in an IRA . Others , however , say that even though you give up capital-gains benefits , stocks may still be the best bet for long-term growth to outpace inflation . Many employers are allowing payroll deductions to IRA 's ; this offers convenience and often lower costs . NCR Corporation in Dayton , Ohio , for one , gives employes a choice . They can funnel their money to NCR 's credit union , a mutual fund that is managed by T. Rowe Price Associates , or a program run by Connecticut General Life Insurance Company for investing in longterm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA-style deposits to a firm 's own pension plan , although that approach appears to be less popular . Withdrawals Though IRA 's are billed as a way to save for retirement , your age rather than job status determines when you can withdraw money . You can take cash out without penalty , gradually or all at once , as early as age 591/2 , and the balance still accumulates tax deferred . Unless you become disabled , withdrawals before 59% are subject to a tax penalty of 10 percent of the amount withdrawn , in addition to your being hit by income tax . The same age limits on withdrawals apply to a spouse for whom you 've opened an IRA . There 's no early withdrawal penalty if you die ,  | in which case your IRA assets can be passed on to heirs . Note : You ca n't get around the earlywithdrawal penalty by borrowing from an IRA or using its assets as collateral for a loan . Do that and you are subject to penalty and tax as if the amount were an early withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the withdrawal penalty scare them . That 's because the tax breaks are so large that in some cases in future years you may come out ahead even if you must incur the penalty . You must start withdrawing from an IRA after you reach 701/2 . At that point , the withdrawals must be at a rate fast enough to deplete the IRA over either your life expectancy or the joint expectancy of you and your spouse . You can make contributions to an IRA up to the year in which you reach 701/2 . But even people under 591/2 can take out IRA funds temporarily without incurring a penalty or tax . Once a year you can close an IRA and hold the funds for up to 60 days before rolling them over into a new account to avoid tax or the 10 percent penalty . You can use the funds as a short-term loan or invest them to get current income . If you want to switch an IRA more than once a year , the institution holding your account must transfer it to the new institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from being hit with tax or penalty . Note : Though you avoid tax penalties in such a transfer , you may run into extra charges levied by the institution in which you have your IRA ? an earlywithdrawal penalty on a savings certificate or a redemption fee on an insurance annuity , for example . The Cost When opening an IRA , there are often initial charges to pay , as well as an annual fee , sometimes based on the value of the account . But the levies are generally small . Banks and S &L's; usually charge nothing to open an IRA and $10 or less a year to maintain it . Many mutual funds charge $5 to $10 to open an IRA and less than $10 a year to keep it up . Self-directed accounts at stockbrokers may cost up to about $30 to open , with a maintenance fee of about $25 or higher depending on the account 's size and type . You also pay commissions on the purchase of stocks and some mutual-fund shares and insurance annuities . The best advice : Shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be wary of promises of high future yields that may not be met.
