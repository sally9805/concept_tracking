Years of low home construction lead to shortages <P> The bellwether housing industry is once again poised for a painful plunge . As the nation 's economy grew by a modest 1% between July and September , home building enjoyed a mild rebound from a steep drop it suffered last spring . But the new run-up in mortgage rates , which has pushed the cost of money to 14.5% in California and New York City , has left millions of home buyers anxiously waiting once again for the cost of money or the price of houses to come down . Says Merrill Butler , president of the National Association of Home Builders : " This was the shortest recovery in the history of the industry . " <P> During the past year , housing has taken some of the heaviest blows from the recession . After the Federal Reserve sharply tightened credit in March , mortgage rates soared to a high of 17% in some areas . As a result , housing starts , which two years ago were running at an annual rate of 2 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home loans fell to about 12% during the summer , customers again began shopping for new homes . Housing starts rose in September to an annual level of 1.5 million , but the increase stemmed largely from new construction on federally subsidized apartments that builders had to get under way before Sept. 30 , when the Government closed the books on its fiscal year . For the first nine months of the year , housing starts lagged a dismal 32% behind 1979 . <P> The sluggish housing market is not only a bad omen for the current health of the economy ; it is also a sure sign of more trouble to come . Because of years of insufficient construction , the U.S. has developed an acute shortage of moderately priced housing . More and more members of the baby-boom generation are now moving into the prime home-buying age group . Divorce , single-person households and the great migration of people to the Sunbelt and the Northwest have placed further strains on the existing housing supply . <P> The U.S. needs an estimated 2.4 million new dwellings annually to meet demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1978 , has the housing industry come even close to that mark . Michael Sumicrast , chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders , predicts that only 1.2 million new housing units will be built this year , the lowest number since 1975 . Says James Christian , senior economist of the United States League of Savings Associations : " We are starting the decade about 1 million units a year short . We will have tough years ahead . Marriages will have to be postponed , and young people will have to double up with families . There is little short-term prospect for closing the gap in the housing deficit . "
