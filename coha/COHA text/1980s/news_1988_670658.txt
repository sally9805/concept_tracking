But opposing lawyers in this momentous struggle over the Constitution ' s separation of powers said the law was a carefully drafted solution to the problem of abuses by high-level officials. // Alexia Morrison , a special prosecutor who has been investigating a former Justice Department official , and Michael Davidson , the Senate ' s legal counsel , urged the Court to uphold the Watergate-inspired law as a remedy against conflicts of interest that would face any Attorney General and any Administration officials in dealing with possible crimes by their colleagues and political associates. // The Justices , hearing an extraordinarily long , 90-minute argument , peppered the lawyers with questions that left spectators uncertain about how they would rule. // Some members of the Court expressed skepticism about the arguments for striking down the law , under which a special court appoints prosecutors independent of the President to investigate suspected crimes by high-level executive branch officials. // Justice Thurgood Marshall said at one point : " Shouldn ' t a prosecutor be independent ? What ' s wrong with it ? " // Others reserved their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case requires the Court to resolve fundamental issues of constitutional law concerning the respective powers of the Presidency , Congress and the judiciary . The political , legal and human drama surrounding the argument is heightened by the extraordinary number of former high-level Reagan Administration officials who have been snared by the special prosecutor law. // Two of President Reagan ' s closest longtime aides , Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger , have been convicted on criminal charges brought by different special prosecutors , Whitney North Seymour Jr. and James C. McKay . A third Reagan associate , Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d , is under investigation by Mr. McKay. // Another special prosecutor , Lawrence E. Walsh , is pressing charges against John M. Poindexter , Mr. Reagan ' s former national security adviser ; Oliver L. North , who was an aide to Mr. Poindexter , and two other defendants on charges growing out of the Iran-contra affair . <> <> Watergate Example // Proponents of the law have often cited President Nixon ' s dismissal of Archibald Cox , the Watergate special prosecutor , in 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President . But Mr. Fried , in what is perhaps his most important argument in nearly three years as Solicitor General , sought to turn that example against them. // " That episode teaches the exact opposite lesson , " Mr. Fried said . " True , the dismissal of special prosecutor Cox was regrettable , but it was not a constitutional catastrophe. " // After the Cox dismissal was followed by a firestorm of public criticism , another special prosecutor was appointed . And Mr. Fried added : " Everyone knows those prosecutions proceeded to their denouement without missing a beat , and they did so not because of jury-rigged constitutional innovations such as we have here , but because of public pressure and the long , deep shadow of Congress ' s power of impeachment. " // Mr. Fried said : " Our central objection is that this statute strips the President of a purely executive function - criminal prosecution , and criminal prosecution in an important class of cases - and lodges that function in one almost wholly untethered to the President. " // The law also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the scrutiny of the executive backed up by the painful duty of impeachment , " Mr. Fried said . <> <> A ' Radical ' Alteration // Also challenging the law was Thomas S. Martin , a Washington lawyer representing former Assistant Attorney General Theodore B. Olson , whom Ms. Morrison has been investigating to determine whether he lied to Congress in 1983 testimony growing out of a battle over alleged political manipulation by the Administration of the Environmental Protection Agency ' s toxic waste cleanup program. // Mr. Martin said the law was an effort by Congress to " radically alter " the constitutional scheme , under which he said the awesome power to prosecute individuals " was put in the hands of a President who is accountable to the people and who was elected by the people. " // Ms. Morrison and Mr. Davidson , in defending the law , seemed studiously to avoid the kinds of rhetorical flourishes that the Court heard from Mr. Fried , as they worked their way through the numerous arcane and technical issues of fact and constitutional interpretation embedded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful , deliberate and restrained effort in the special prosecutor law to solve an important national problem. // Ms. Morrison said the special prosecutor law guards not only against favoritism when an Administration investigates possible wrongdoing by its own officials , but also against the danger that officials , in order to avoid the appearance of favoritism , will bring prosecutions that should not be brought . <> <> Reagan Appointees ' Questions // The law also provides those investigated with " independent and much more meaningful clearance " when allegations ultimately prove unwarranted , she said. // " There is no concern here about Congressional aggrandizement of its own powers , " Ms. Morrison said , because Congress had given itself no power over special prosecutors . She said this made the case unlike others in which the Court has struck down laws on separation-of-powers grounds. // In their questions , three of President Reagan ' s appointees - Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O ' Connor and Antonin Scalia - seemed to place the greatest stress on the weakest points in the arguments by Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointee , Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , was not present . He has recused himself from the case for undisclosed reasons. // Chief Justice Rehnquist , seemingly sympathetic to arguments by Mr. Fried and Mr. Martin that prosecution is a " core executive function " entrusted by the Constitution to the President , said at one point that the Court ' s precedents suggest " you can not assign to one branch certain functions that inherently belong to the other. " // A few minutes later , Justice Scalia recalled his own service in the 1970 ' s as the head of the Justice Department ' s Office of Legal Counsel , the same office Mr. Olson headed when he gave the testimony investigated by Ms. Morrison . Chief Justice Rehnquist also headed that office before President Nixon nominated him to be an Associate Justice in 1971. // Being called to testify before Congress " is not always a happy occasion , " Justice Scalia said . He expressed concern that Congressional demands for special prosecutor investigations of officials suspected of not being forthright could " shift the balance of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> ' Don ' t See Any Impropriety " // On the other hand , Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun suggested skepticism of some of the arguments for striking down the law , as did Justice Marshall. // When Mr. Martin suggested that judicial appointment of special prosecutors " presents enormous problems for the appearance of impartiality of the judiciary , " for example , Justice Stevens said , " I just don ' t see any impropriety . " He added that " judges have been appointing defense counsel for years " to represent indigent criminal defendants. // Justice Byron R. White , whose vote is viewed by many experts as potentially crucial in the case , asked sharp , skeptical questions to lawyers on both sides . " He ' s always hard on everybody ' s side , " one experienced Supreme Court litigator said after the argument. // Justice William J. Brennan Jr. asked no questions and made no comments , not unusual for him. // The special prosecutor law was first passed by Congress in 1978 to require appointment of special prosecutors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulate those prosecutors from Presidential control. // It was re-enacted with minor amendments in 1982 , when Congress changed the formal title from special prosecutor to " independent counsel , " and re-enacted again late last year. // President Reagan signed the latter two versions even though his own Justice Department had pronounced the law unconstitutional earlier last year . Two Reagan-appointed Federal appel late judges here struck down the law on Jan. 22 over a dissent by an appointee of President Carter , in the case now before the Supreme Court . <> <> Appointment by Judges // The law requires the Attorney General , whenever he receives specific and credible information of a possible crime by a high-level executive branch official , to launch a preliminary investigation . If the charges appear substantial , he must then apply to a " special devision " of three Federal appellate judges based here for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate and , if appropriate , prosecute the official. // The law authorizes the special court to define the special prosecutor ' s jurisdiction . It also bars the Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special prosecutor except for specified causes. // A Federal appellate panel struck down the law on at least five grounds earlier this year by a vote of 2-1 . Two Reagan-appointed judges were in the majority ; an appointee of President Carter ' s was in dissent. // The case the Court heard today , Morrison v. Olson , No. 87-1279 , is Ms. Morrison ' s appeal of that decision , which grew out of her efforts to enforce subpoenas for evidence against Mr. Olson and two other former officials and which would put an end to her two-year-old investigation if reversed. //
