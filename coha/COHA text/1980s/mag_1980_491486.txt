COMPUTER CRIME by David Bumke A ll right now , once and for all : Does crime pay , or does n't it ? Of course it pays , we know that . But there 's always that problem of being caught , going to jail , of not being invited to the best parties anymore . A friend of ours was caught and they gave him 30 years  --  that sort of thing . Anyway , if you 're smart and lucky you find other , safer roads to the American dream . Yet it appears that now , in larger and larger numbers , the young and the restless and some of the best and the brightest are resorting to crime . They 're stealing a living . . . and a very good one at that . A generation of bold , sophisticated computerizing pilferers is now at large iii the world . They are out there somewhere , sipping champagne and lighting five-dollar cigars with hundred-dollar bills , but most of them are so sophisticated that it is impossible even to estimate how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or where or why . To speak of the " brains " behind a big rip-off is less and less a joke , more and more a fact of life . These people are smarter than the average crook ; in fact they are smarter than the average anything . M.I.T. and Cal Tech are  --  inadvertently , one still assumes  --  training more than engineers and nuclear physicists these days . They are teaching skills , not ethics . Jerry Schneider  --  one of the principles in this instructive tale of how to steal from others and make yourself richer  --  admits that , in school , deontology was n't required . " Nobody ever taught me that I could do good things and bad things with machines  --  just that Icould do things . " Schneider listened well to what they taught . Years earlier he had walked to school past a Pacific Telephone supply warehouse . Sometimes he had poked around in their trash , occasionally taking a few things home with him : discarded equipment , technical manuals , all manner of junk which , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The junk stayed there until Schneider became an engineering student at U.C.L.A. Then he remembered his little library and , just for fun , decided to read the manuals . From them he learned a few things which intrigued him , not the leastof which being that he now had at his disposal sufficient information to enable him , just for fun , to make a great deal of money . Actually , the information was not quite sufficient ; he had to wheedle certain identification and account code numbers out of unsuspecting Pacific Telephone employees . He called them , impersonating telephone-company technicians and posing as a free-lance writer interested in computerized warehouse systems . A little nerve and a little knowledge were all he needed . Once he had succeeded in these simple ruses , the rest was child 's play ( there are some pretty slick kids running around out there today ) . He purchased an automatic dialer , so that his Touch-Tone telephone 's signals would seem authentic to the company 's IBM 360 computer ( would be authentic , in fact  --  to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He then used the information and expertise he had accumulated to arrange for the delivery of equipment to particular sites ( one time he had a $25,000 switchboard delivered to a company manhole at 2:00 a.m . ) . The material dropped at these sites was picked up and transferred to his own warehouse . He had formed a corporation , the Los Angeles Telephone &; Telegraph Company , which then sold the equipment to private suppliers and users . Eventually he was caught ; that is , he was turned in by an employee who had been refused a raise . But although he had diverted more than a million dollars worth of equipment , he served only 40 days of a 60-day sentence at a prison farm . Pacific Telephone sued him , but he was able to settle with them for just $8,500 . When he was released from the prison farm he set himself up as a computer-security consultant , helping other corporations avoid what Pacific Telephone did not avoid . And he has sold the story of his lucrative shenanigans to a movie company  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to ask him whether crime pays . When people " do things " as well as Schneider did them , the odds are that the police wo n't catch them . According to one officer who was involved in the Pacific Telephone investigation , " the problem is that they 're so damned bright . The people I work with , a lot of them are pretty smart cops . But these guys on the computers , and the phone freaks , and all those other people who sit down with their paper and pencil to figure out the perfect crime and then go out and commit it  --  what real chance do we have against that ? People complain that we do n't try very hard in these cases . And to be perfectly honest I 'd have to say we probably do n't . But it seems to me that in the cases where we ca n't even find out for sure whether anybody 's done anything wrong , nobody 's being hurt very much . We 've got our hands full with rapes and muggings and murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of the crimes perpetrated by those who reside in the heady upper ranges of the I.Q. scale : They tend not to be investigated or prosecuted with much energy . Donn B. Parker , who has been collecting and studying cases of computer abuse ( 500 so far ) since 1969 , complains that " law enforcementdoes n't recognize the danger in computer abuse . Federal authorities tell me they 're already swamped by white-collar crime . They have no time to worry about automation . But computer technology has grown so fast that security is lagging 10 years behind . The opportunity for really big rip-offs is here . " When he says " really big , " he means it . The average computer-assisted take is already $450,000 , and anyone worth his salt has gotten away with a million or two . A convicted felon , interviewed recently in prison , was asked to assess the profits and perils of his profession . " Well , " he answered , " I would n't suggest that anyone should start out in crime nowadays  --  there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real good con artist , and he 'd probably be legit anyway ? ' case that 's what they are , are n't they ? " " Yes , " say Jerry Schneider and company , in effect . " That 's exactly what we are  --  legit . " If , like Schneider , you get caught , you can serve a short sentence , pay a small fine , and go back to playing with your computer  --  this time , supposedly on the level . But if your subversive , greedy inclinations remain unsatisfied , you can just pretend to rehabilitate yourself . You can develop a security system for your employer which is absolutely foolproof  --  except to the one , by no means a fool , who has designed it . Or to anyone who happens to be just a wee bit craftier than that crafty designer . And this is apparently the one thing anyone can count on in the face of our mushrooming technology : There is , and will always be , someone who is a wee bit craftier . The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capabilities , this may be understandable . But the courts ? Why  --  when the police stumble inadvertently over some mammoth embezzlement  --  do the courts let the thief off so easily ? Well , for one thing , they do n't . Not always . Consider , for example , the case of the unfortunate bookkeeper who deftly siphoned off a cool million from his employers . He felt justified ; his bosses were thieves themselves , and had each been stealing about $400,000 annually from the company . They depended upon their bookkeeper to keep them one jump ahead of the IRS . He did . But he did n't like it . " I had a couple of choices , " he says . " I could hit my boss in the mouth , or I could take his money . The latter gave me more pleasure because I was making a monkey out of the jerk and he did n't even realize it . " So he used the company 's computer to slice away a fraction of a cent here and there while keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In six years ' time he had his million . But by then he wanted out , he was tired and was willing to be caught . This was not an easy thing to arrange , however . He had had everything running so smoothly for so long that it took some extremely large , intentional bloopers to convince the people in charge that something might be wrong . Continued on following page Finally , after he had arranged to overdraw one account by $78,000 , the bank called his boss . And his boss , after picking himself up off the floor , called the cops . Later , when his lawyer suggested he plead guilty to one of the 69 counts of grand theft and forgery with which he was charged , he did . " You 'll be out in 18 months , " claimed the lawyer . Unfortunately , the judge sentenced him to 10 years , of which he had to serve five and a half . And this sentence , if you can believe the former bookkeeper , has deterred him from further electronic black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the risks outweight the gains . " At the same time , however , he admits that he has managed to safely tucked away all the money he will ever need . It took eleven and a half years of work and prison , but he feels it was well worth the trouble . Today he is looking into the possibility of buying the same company he used to work for  --  and steal from . He explains : " That would be a neat cycle  --  to buy the business with its own money . I hope it works out . Just for the symmetry of the whole thing . " This is what happens to the unlucky ones . And only when they want to be caught . Crime is work , he 'd tell you , but yes , it does pay . In general , however , the electronic whiz kid can expect a gentle slap on the hand ( not hard enough to harm his valuable programming fingers ) from the bench . The 10-year sentence for the bookkeeper is a conspicuous exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges seem to say , it does n't seem fair to send such nice people off to such nasty prisons . And computer criminals are , usually , nice people . Michael Kessler is a case in point . Between 1970 and 1973 he embezzled approximately $1.5 million from the Park Avenue , New York , branch of the Union Dime Savings Bank . He was the branch 's chief teller , and although he had never had any formal computer training , he learned enough in his day-to-day work to be able to cover up his extensive , unauthorized cash " withdrawals . " Kessler had no sympathy for the bank . He felt it was paying him too little and working him too much . He would have been glad to fleece them out of all they were worth . But he was concerned that his embezzlement could bring hardship to the owners of particular accounts . Many of these were elderly people who had entrusted the bank with their lives ' savings . There could be no problem as long as he was in control ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular accounts by borrowing from other , less active ones . In order , however , to protect the customers in the event that he was someday apprehended , he took care not to remove more than $20,000 from any one account  --  at that time the maximum amount covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . When the FDIC raised the ceiling to $40,000 , Kessler was pleased to raise his own limits as well . As usually happens in such cases , the detection of Kessler 's evil deeds came about totally by accident . He was a compulsivegambler who had begun stealing from the bank in order to feed his habit . At the end he was losing $30,000 a day . It is likely that he would still be handing over such incredible sums today , if not for a chance police raid of his bookie 's operation . When the cops found Kessler 's name in those records listed beside such colossal daily bets , they decided to look a little further . They traced him to the bank , and the embezzlement was discovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half dollars . He pleaded guilty , saying that he was very sorry . The judge , motivated in part by Kessler 's touching consideration for the bank 's patrons , said he was very sorry , too , and then sentenced Kessler to only 20 months in jail . Kessler was out in 15 . Because he never caught up with his losses ( the closest he ever got was $28,000 in the hole ) , his spectacular accomplishment was more or less in vain ; he now drives a cab 14 hours a day and attends meetings of Gamblers Anonymous . He has apparently been unable or unwilling to capitalize on his status as a criminal celebrity . Maybe he 's just too nice a guy to do that ! In contrast , John Thomas Draper is not so nice  --  at least not to Ma Bell and certain government agencies . Draper , known to his fans and followers as Captain Crunch , is a legendary phone freak ( or phreak , as in Phone Phreaks International , a worldwide fraternity of users and abusers ) .

Like use the little computer terminal in my living room to explore secrets of the AUTOVON military defense network and perhaps start a little war . " Now I say it 's possible to penetrate any computer linked to a telephone , reprogram it , and steal things . But I 'm not saying I did this . I 'm a good guy now . I cooperated with the feds and showed them things . I tried to teach Ma Bell , too . She 's the largest , leakiest computer system in the world . " Whether or not Captain Crunch had done what he says he could have done , he was in fact imprisoned in a federal facility for four months . It is possible that he was a victim of government harassment , but if so , it was harass- ment by government which he had already harassed . Reformed , he plans to start a computer security business . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , crooked or straight . These button-pushers and the keypunchers and the smart guys on the Touch-Tone phones  --  these crooks will cost us hundreds of millions of dollars this year ( one expert 's estimate is much higher : $10 billion ) . Two and a half million people control 350,000 computer systems , and too many of these people seem to possess great minds bent on grand theft .
