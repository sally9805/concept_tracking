 | The gleam in an art collector 's eye is unmistakable and a little mad . It combines an almost religious devotion to art with a rank lust for the discovery , pursuit and capture of the desired object ; the true collector savors both the salon and the dealer 's back room . For many , collecting becomes the ruling passion of life . On occasion less beguiling qualities may also sweeten the gleam in his eye . Certain collectors buy art in order to enhance their status or prestige . Art is a fashionable way to decorate money ; a great collection brings in its train the fawning attention of neighbors , curators and the press . Some collectors now buy art as an investment , while others form collections as a way to memorialize themselves . There 's nothing new in this : the rich have often used art as a way to piggyback into history . Gifts : Whatever their motives , collectors have done a great service for museums and the public , not only through their gifts to museums , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any one area of a museum 's collection , for example , is often the result of a collector 's passion . This fall three important collections are on display in the United States . Each reveals a different approach to the art of collecting . In some respects , Jo Ann and Julian Ganz Jr . are the most appealing kind of collectors . A California couple in their 50s who own a chain of furniture stores , they are not so rich that price is no object : to buy one picture they must often sell a second . They did not set out to become art collectors , but found that one picture led to another . Their collection of nineteenth-century American art has been formed without hiring advisers or middlemen : they have educated their own eyes . In 1964 the Ganzes bought their first American painting , a Robert Henri portrait that they saw by chance . " We did n't know who Henri was , " says Julian Ganz , " so we began to study that period . " This led them @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From there they began to look at somewhat earlier art ? particularly the more tightly painted pictures of the Hudson River school . " We began to see that we liked that period best , " he says . " We came to the conclusion we could do a better job of collecting in a highly defined area . " Today the heart of their collection , on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. , lies in the period from 1850 to 1875 . Knowing this , dealers offer them good pictures from that era . The Ganzes themselves have intensively studied the period , and they constantly refine their collection . " We have no need to possess forever , " he says . " The objective is to get the best possible finely focused collection , within the financial means . " To get an important work by the landscape painter Jasper Cropsey , for example , they sold four of his lesser works . Forming an important collection requires luck as well as hard work and cash . It would be impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become fashionable . The Ganzes also had one great year . In 1976-77 one ofJulian Ganz 's investments produced some ready money , and just then excellent pictures came on the market by Cole , Church , Homer , Lane , Cropsey , Sargent , Sully and Raphaelle Peale . Buying those pictures elevated their collection from choice to important . They have also had some luck with individual pictures . For years they coveted Eastman Johnson 's " Bo Peep . " They were able to buy it when one owner went bankrupt and the next died . Because the collection is a personal mat-@#  | ter , it possesses a distinctive flavor . There are numerous domestic-genre scenes , still lifes and gentle landscapes . Many are good , others less so . Some of the art reflects sappy Victorian taste : the dainty-maiden look , for example , or neo-classical puffery . One picture , unintentionally funny , portrays a sad Orpheus strumming his lyre for an audience of earnest rabbits . Yet the Ganzes have the courage of their taste , and their collection presents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come of age . The Ganzes have taken great care in finding the right period frames , and they constantly rehang paintings in their Los Angeles home . They enjoy spending time with pictures in a domestic setting ? which is , of course , the way the art was meant to be seen . The paintings , says Jo Ann Ganz , can " lift your soul and lighten your heart . " In short , it is a living collection . The strangest story of collecting in this century is that of George Costakis , a Greek citizen who was born and lived in Moscow until 1977 . Costakis , who held a minor job at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow , amassed more than 5,000 works by artists of the Russian avant-garde , which flourished just before and after the revolution . It is thanks to his collection , part of which is on display at the Guggenheim Museum in New York , that the art of that period has survived in any depth , for Stalin snuffed out the movement in the late ' 20s . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about 20 percent of his collection with him , including works by acknowledged masters of the period , like Malevich , and by excellent , lesser-known artists , such as Ivan Kliun and Olga Rozanova . An obsessive collector for most of his life , Costakis , 69 , who did not start out with much money , was able to buy the discredited art at very low prices . Having begun with silver and Dutch paintings , he switched to the avant-garde works in 1946 . " When I put these works next to my old Dutch masters , " he says , " the dark windows seemed to open wide and the sun came in . " Ridicule : At first collecting proved difficult . His problem was ridicule , not money or government interference . " Things were just tossed aside , " he says . " Artists and their families had given up . " When Costakis bought a painting , the seller often gave him additional works for free . Once Costakis noticed that a painting on plywood by the great artist Liubov Popova was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture by promising to replace the plywood . Costakis bought everything he could get his hands on , for which art historians have blessed him . " People would say , I just sold some more junk to that stupid Greek ' . " At one time , he sold almost all his possessions to buy more work . His apartment in Moscow overflowed with art . " The collector must be mad , " says Costakis , " ready to sell himself , do almost anything ! " The great question about Costakis is why the Soviets allowed him to form this collec-@#  | tion . No doubt part of the answer was that Costakis held Greek citizenship . He also tried not to offend the authorities ; for example , he would not introduce foreign visitors to radical Russian artists . Perhaps the government even found it convenient for him to collect the art that was gaining such a reputation in Europe and the West . Cautious bureaucrats may have decided , " Let the Greek protect and gather this stuff . That way we can preserve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be valuable . " Today 80 percent of the Costakis collection is in the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow . Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza , whose collection of old-master paintings is on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , inherited much of his art and his money . His grandfather , the Andrew Carnegie of Germany , made the fortune ; his father added the art . The present baron . who has maintained both family traditions . possesses one of the best collections of old masters in private hands . It is a collection that includes many of the greatest names of Western painting , from Duccio to Goya . Most of the paintings are kept at the family museum in Switzerland . The baron first became actively involved in collecting after his father 's death in 1947. when the collection was divided among the heirs . He bought up many of the pictures from his family . One of the finest , a painting of the Virgin by Petrus Christus , eluded him : the owner was in Germany , and the Germans would not let the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , however , the owner impulsively gave the picture to Konrad Adenauer , who eventually sent it to a dealer in Switzerland . No one questioned the action of so high an official ? and the baron was able to buy back the picture . In recent years the baron has added a substantial number of old-master paintings to the collection : for example , a panel from Duccio 's " Maesta " altarpiece . In a period when fewer and fewer important old paintings come on the market , this has been possible because of certain advantages a rich private collector has over a museum . He can often come up with money ? more money ? faster than a museum . Many people also prefer to sell pictures quietly , to avoid the hubbub that attends auction sales and important museum purchases . An assortment of old-master paintings from varied periods possesses a kind of immovable weight : an individual can not easily stamp his own taste on such a collection . The baron has expanded his buying into fresh areas , however , such as twentiethcentury art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : unshakable virus . And he has employed excellent historians , curators and conservators to present and care for the art . It is a magnificent collection , well tended .
