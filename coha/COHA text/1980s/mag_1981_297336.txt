States and localities gear up to cope with federal slashes <P> As some 400 New England state officials listened glumly in a lecture hall at the University of Massachusetts ' Boston campus last week , an official of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services droned on in a tongue known only to career bureaucrats , a patois of federal title numbers , " transmittals " and agency acronyms . The meeting was the first of eight regional briefings by the White House 's Office of Management and Budget to explain the Reagan Administration 's new block-grant program . The plan lumps together funds for some three dozen social service , education and community-aid programs into nine block grants that states will now , within certain guidelines , be able to spend as they see fit . If the meeting 's language was arcane , the message was simple : as approved by Congress last July , the block-grant plan will cut federal funding for those programs by 25% , and leave it up to local officials somehow to cope . Predicted Massachusetts State Senator Jack H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of human misery . " <P> Though the cuts will not take effect until Oct. 1 , many states and counties are drawing up plans to slash social services or up taxes-or both . The cuts come at a time when state coffers have already been drained by unemployment , which has diminished revenues from sales and income taxes , and by inflation , which has sent costs skyrocketing . " The situation was already grim , " says Dave Willis , a California state finance officer . " The federal cuts just compound our problems . " <P> Worse yet , no one knows exactly what the impact of the federal budget cuts will be on social services . Congress has yet to agree on the specifics of the appropriations bills . Meanwhile , Administration officials are being maddeningly vague on how the funds will be distributed and what guidelines must be followed . State officials are busy poring over mounds of memorandums , trying desperately to divine exactly what is in store for their states . Says Dick Chady , spokesman for the New York State department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper two feet high . You would think that this whole thing is a plot by Xerox . "
