Bringing down America 's twin deficits will demand a wealth of ideas and compromises . No single fix will do the job . Nor are any of the remedies likely to be painless . But the Administration and Congress still have time to tailor a compromise on reducing the budget gap before the Nov. 20 deadline , when $23 billion in arbitrary cuts takes hold under the Gramm-Rudman law . Some reasonable proposals for boosting revenue , cutting spending and reducing the trade deficit : <P> Levy an energy tax . This could be a twofer : it would not only help ease the budget deficit but could also reduce the trade gap by discouraging demand for imported oil . A tax of $5 per bbl. on annual U.S. imports of some 1.5 billion bbl. of foreign crude would raise approximately $7.5 billion in extra revenues . An alternative is a gasoline tax of 5 cents per gal . in addition to the current 9 cents federal levy , which would produce an extra $5 billion or so ( 1986 U.S. consumption : 112 billion gal . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in low-income brackets could receive offsetting credits on their income tax returns . <P> Cut agricultural supports . Too much of the price-support budget goes to the wealthiest farmers . During 1985 , when $23.7 billion was distributed , only one- third of U.S. farms collected price supports ; almost 70% of those payments went to farmers with annual sales of $100,000 or more . Former Delaware Governor Pete du Pont , a Republican presidential contender , proposes to wean farmers from income subsidies over five years , thus producing a $5 billion savings the first year and $75 billion in total . Agrees Harvard Economist Robert Reich : " The benefit of such aid is not as great as the social costs in failing to cut it . " <P> Trim defense spending . Since no one thinks that America 's 2.1 million soldiers and sailors are overpaid , scrutiny should be focused on the 50% of the nearly $300 billion defense budget that goes for hardware , operations and maintenance . What deserves even more attention than the notorious price gouging by defense contractors on spare parts ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large-scale weapons systems . A raft of new , expensive hardware is coming out of research , ready to go into production . One package of eight strategic systems ( total cost : at least $250 billion ) includes the Stealth bomber and three missile systems : the submarine-launched D-5 , the Midgetman and the Peacekeeper ( formerly MX ) . Congress should seriously reconsider whether all these different weapons are necessary . <P> Tighten up interest deductions . America 's most venerable tax shelter is the deduction on home-mortgage interest , a provision that was originally created to help families buy their first home . But perhaps that write-off is too generous . Earlier this month the House Ways and Means Committee adopted a $12.3 million tax-increase package that , among other measures , would finally put a cap on the deduction , limiting it to the first $1 million in mortgage debt . But why not lower the boom even further ? As Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski pointed out , " With the people I represent , if you talk $75,000 , you 're talking big money for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
