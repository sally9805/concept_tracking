 |p481  THE CAFE RANG with the jokes and laughter of the fishermen of Honfleur , that lovely port which lingers like a dream T the 16th century at the mouth of the River Seine . Daniel Le Cesle , captain of the fishing boat Annick , drained a glass of milky pastis and asked me : " Do you get seasick ? " " Never ! " I responded , with a confidence born in the airless holds of troopships and on the plunging decks of oceangoing sailboats . " Bon , " said Daniel . " We sail at quarter to four in the morning . " Now it was morning , a slate gray morning scribbled with rain , and I was a chastened man . Her diesel engine chuffing , Annick leaped from wave to wave in a six-foot sea , encouraged at every crest by a watery slap on her flat bottom . Clinging to a shroud with my back to the wind , I most heartily apologized to every victim of seasickness to whom I had ever given a condescending smile . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned Annick into the wind and with the help of his mate , Paul Vallae , deployed the nets in the heaving waters of La Manche . ( As a guest aboard a French vessel , one does not call the English Channel by its English name . ) In the hours since I had come aboard in velvety darkness , climbing down an iron ladder to the deck of the boat , just barely afloat on a rising tide , we had let out the nets and brought them in all but empty three times . Now it was nearly noon , and our last chance to go home with a decent catch . Annick rocked crazily in the trough of a wave . The net was winched aboard . Foot by foot it rose dripping from the sea . It seemed that it must be empty again . And then we saw the mackerel , black and symmetrical , with a few mullet and flounder gleaming among them like coins in the fat purse we had snatched from the sea . With the fish packed in baskets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul busied himself mending nets . Daniel lifted the microphone of the boat 's radio to his lips and began to sing : " J'ai de beaux maquereaux , six cents kilos . " On the horizon , rising and falling in the swell , we could see the masts of the Honfleur fishing fleet . Its captains returned Daniel 's song , telling of their own catch , and the marine frequency was filled with a hallelujah chorus of men of the Seine , happy to be steering for home . As we entered the estuary , the waters of the Seine , brown with the soil of France , came out to meet us . In the pale light I glimpsed the bleak skyline of Le Havre , like a sad concrete marker to the old Le Havre whose stones were scattered by the bombardment of 1944 . Across the river , on the left bank , Honfleur lifted her silhouette of bell tower , sail , and mansard roof . This is the gate to France . More than a thousand years ago , Vikings sailed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region and to the fat land , and Norsemen became Normans . In 1603 Champlain sailed from the Seine with a Norman crew to plant , in Nova Scotia , the first significant French settlement in the New World . Just upriver lies Conteville , where a bastard of the Duke of Normandy , afterward to be known as William the Conqueror , may have spent part of his childhood . At Rouen , a night 's passage on a rising tide , smoke drifted across the Seine as the body of Joan of Arc burned at the stake on May 30 , 1431 . Nine hundred years before the Vikings , Julius Caesar encountered fierce Celtic people on an island in the Seine that the Romans called Lutetia Parisiorum and envisaged as a major city of their empire . In 52 B.C. , on Mount Auxois , Caesar had defeated the great Gaul Vercingetorix at the siege of Alesia . Where the sword of Vercingetorix fell at Caesar 's feet , Gaul began to die and Latin France began to live. * Some would say that the two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribalism 481  |p482  caressing enlightenment , and that the result is French civilization . The Seine rises in a wood some ten miles from the site of Caesar 's victory . It is said that the river , which begins as a spring bubbling from the earth , was formed by the tears of a nymph pursued by a satyr into this grove on the Plateau de Langres , which forms a watershed between streams that debouch into the Mediterranean and those that run toward the Channel . The Seine flows 496 miles to La Manche , draining 30,000 square miles as it passes through Burgundy , Champagne , the Ile-de-France , and Normandy . It becomes navigable at Marcilly , 165 miles from the source , where it is joined by the Aube ( map , pages 484-5 ) . THE AUBE ? What is that ? " The speaker was a Frenchwoman , a formidable intellectual . We were chatting at a dinner party in Paris . I explained that the Aube was the first of the Seine 's main tributaries , the others being the Yonne , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 's no wonder I 've never heard of the Aube , " said my companion . " Nothing in France becomes interesting until it passes through Paris . " To the French , who dislike leaving things unnamed and unexplained , the Seine is le fleuve civilisateur ? the civilizing river . Had it not passed through Paris , they undoubtedly would have called it something else . I first saw the Seine with my own eyes when I was 18 years old . By then I already knew it well : I had seen it through the eyes of Hugo and Balzac and Dumas , Corot and Manet and Pissarro . In those days , just after the Second World War , no howling packs of automobiles raced along the quays . Instead , elms and chestnuts and plane trees dotted the greensward that stretched from the Cathedral of Notre Dame to the Bois de Boulogne , a green ribbon of shade and tranquillity binding the city to its people . It was a Sunday morning in May . As yet the sun gave off no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket . A long brown loaf of bread lay in a basket . A man was opening a bottle of red wine ; it was ordinary rough wine , and the bottle had no label . He poured two glasses and gave one to a girl , who was sunbathing . They @#  |p484  drank , talking animatedly . They kissed . The girl saw me staring . I expected her to be angry that a stranger should dare to take pleasure in her happiness . But she smiled . " Bonjour , monsieur , " she called . " Is it not marvelous ? " Indeed it was ? the towers of Notre Dame at my back , the great facade of the Louvre on my right , the frieze of chimney pots on the Left Bank , all suffused in the light over the Seine , like sunshine reflected from a very old coin , which no painter has ever truly captured . In the three decades since , hardly a year has passed when I have not lived in France or visited her , and I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wine and kisses . But when I hear the word " France , " I see the Seine as I saw it on that first luminous morning . Technically , the Seine rises in Paris , for the little grove of poplars and firs in which the spring bubbles from the earth was purchased in the 19th century by the Commune de Paris and made a part of the French capital . There , on a rainy morning , I encountered a very angry young woman who rushed out of the grove , tossing a mane of crackling black hair , and locked herself into a car with Paris plates . Her young male friend rapped on the windshield and called her name through the glass in vain . I was gazing at the statue of Sequana , @#  |p485  goddess of the Seine , which was erected in 1865 at the order of Napoleon III , when the young man rushed into the grove with a Perrier bottle in his hand . He threw himself to the ground , reached through the iron bars into the grotto where Sequana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , he saw my puzzled look . " This water is supposed to be good for love , " he said , and dashed out of the grove . In the days when Burgundy was a great forest , a temple to the river deity stood here ; it had healing properties , and in the times of chivalry was renowned for the efficacy of its love baths . When I returned to the road , the car doors had been unlocked . The waters had not lost their power ? or lovers their ingenuity , as you wish . FROM THE SOURCE to Chatillon , 30 miles to the north , the Seine trickles through forest and meadow , sometimes no more than a string of puddles that in hot summers evaporate into the air . In few places is it too broad for leaping . In the village of **25;404;TOOLONG , a very old man found me gazing at the obelisk commemorating the five young men of the village who had died in the Great War . I was a bit embarrassed , and asked , " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man nodded at the weatherworn monument . " They did , " he said . Others still do . At Chatillon the trickle is swelled by the Douix , an underground torrent bursting from a limestone cliff . The first bridge downstream is 12 paces long , and as the Seine flows beneath graceful bridges through this gray-stone town , it ceases to sparkle and begins to glow , like a tomboy realizing that she is turning into a beauty . Chatillon is the keeper of an object of surpassing beauty and mystery , the Vase of Vix . When I came upon this burnished message from antiquity , schoolchildren were dancing around it , and the guard in the municipal museum , Louis Dupars , was looking a trifle nervous . " After all , " he said , " those who knew how to create such an object have been dead since perhaps six centuries before Christ . " The bronze vase was found in 1953 in the funeral mound of a woman who had been buried on Mount Lassois , about four miles north of Chatillon , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek artisans , it is the largest urn of its type and period yet discovered . It stands five feet four inches high , and Monsieur Dupars assured me that it would hold 1,100 liters ( 290 gallons ) of wine . Richly decorated with a frieze of warriors and chariots , perfect in its symmetry , it took away my breath .  |p490  But not , happily , that of Monsieur Dupars : " I wonder if those children , who know only things made by machines , can understand what miracles men once created with nothing but their hands . " The Vase of Vix , together with the large collection of other objects dug up at Mount Lassois , is a relic of a trading center that existed at least as long ago as the sixth century B.C. The Romans always had a bit of an inferiority complex about the Greeks . Is it possible that the blood of the Hellenes flowed in the veins of the " barbarians " Julius Caesar defeated near the headwaters of the Seine ? It is not inconceivable that those merry corpuscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I encountered in the brasserie of the Europa Hotel in Chdtillon . Dining on a young duck with peas and a glass of the good red house wine , I noticed at the next table a group of convivial grayhaired ladies . They joked and sang , they gave each other second helpings from heaping platters of chicken and fried potatoes , they were obviously the greatest of friends . When one of them squeezed the neck of an empty inverted bottle and made a joke about a cow gone dry , I sent over another bottle of the rose they had been drinking . One of the ladies , a tiny person , left the table amid jokes and nudgings . In her absence I learned that the ladies were members of the Foyer des Capucins , a club for retired women . The tiny person returned . She wore a homemade bear costume , baggy , shaggy , the color of cinnamon . Her " paws " were black socks , with " claws " of white yarn . A dog , asleep beneath his owner 's table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron , sang a song , and lent its head to a little girl and posed for a picture . I asked the name of the tiny person . " Mademoiselle Alice , " she said . I thanked her for the pretty surprise . " Not at all , " said Mademoiselle Alice . Then , realizing that I was not French and probably could not understand , unaided , that everything was all in fun , she explained to me : " The costume , the buffoonery , they are only for Tuesday night , 490 you understand , monsieur ; our time to have a good time . " BETWEEN Chatillon and Troyes , the Seine flows through hushed villages , past disused mill wheels and broken weirs , and passes out of Burgundy and into Champagne . Standing before the walls of Troyes in 1429 , Charles VII wavered ; the great medieval city was in the hands of the English , and it seemed impregnable to the timid monarch . Beside him stood Joan of Arc . " Noble King of France , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days have passed , she will submit either by force or out of love . " Joan spoke of destiny , not luck ; the king agreed to give fate a week to do its work . The next morning Troyes surrendered , and Joan led the king 's army through its gates . In the old quarter of Troyes , halftimbered houses have been inching toward a kiss above narrow streets since the 16th century . In the most famous of these dim cobbled passages , the Rue des Chats ( " cats ' street " ) , I came on a white kitten taking a bath . Above it , the raddled faces of the splintery old lovers touched at last , and the kitten 's fur was dampened only by its tongue though a heavy rain drummed on the roofs . At Fontainebleau , country chateau of French royalty , I encountered Louis Prost , fencing master and curator of the Musee Napoleonien , who purchased his first saber at the age of 12 . Now he has 800 of them : " Sabers of the monarchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The museum 's astonishing display of weapons , uniforms , and memorabilia is built on Monsieur Prost 's private collection . " This includes , " he declared , " the most beautiful hat of Napoleon in the world . " Indeed it is a fine bicorne , one of a dozen known to have sat upon the head of the emperor ; he lost it , according to Monsieur Prost , after being wounded on April 23 , 1809 , at the Battle of Regensburg ( Ratisbon ) .  |p491  Monsieur Prost 's intimacy with Bonaparte made the great man more real to my wife , Nancy , and me as we walked that afternoon through the gloomy rooms of the Palace of Fontainebleau . The current building , on the site of an earlier royal hunting lodge , was begun in the 16th century , looted during the revolution , and eventually refurnished by Napoleon . According to some historians , he preferred it to Versailles because he could not bear the glitter of an earlier , more glorious monarchy . I think the plainer atmosphere simply suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirtation . Nancy and I imagined this intrepid genius , who led his soldiers into the sands of Egypt and the snows of Russia , finally signing his abdication in these rooms . That night we slept across the street from the palace . Or rather , I slumbered peacefully . Nancy was awakened by an overwhelming sensation that someone was in the room . Whoever it was sat on her bed , depressing the mattress , and gave a long , sorrowful sigh . Nancy 's eyes flew open . No visible being sat at the foot of her bed , but she felt the weight of a person there and heard the sigh again . " Monsieur Prost has got your hat , " Nancy whispered . The ghost went away . Yes , said a hotel employee next morning , there is a phantom ; he sighs and sits on beds . We moved on to Paris . PARIS , bride of the Seine , is the symbol of France . It was not always so . Many of the great cities of Roman Gaul grew up along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loire to besiege Orleans , did not pause to conquer Paris . Charlemagne abandoned her for Aix-laChapelle ( Aachen ) . Twelfth-century Capetian kings transformed Paris into a center of Western politics and culture , but civil revolts and occupation by the English , who crowned their Henry VI king of France in Notre Dame , again led to her decline . Meanwhile , French kings and nobles favored their flashy chateaus on the Loire . In the 16th and 17th chic , April 1982 The Civilizing Seine  |p498  centuries Paris again became a center of French culture . In the end , the city gave birth to the revolution and became the immortal queen of France , girt by her shimmering river . To me , the most symbolic spot in France is a bronze medallion sunk in the pavement in the shadow of Notre Dame . This is the point , the mystic center , from which all distances are measured . In all things French , Paris is the standard of measurement . A LOVELY GIRL is a rare sight in the provinces , but Paris teems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Parisian , but seldom stupidity : Citizens of Paris owe it to their city , which is a monument to the variety of the mind , to behave intelligently , to add their daily digit to the sum of excellence . At a flower stall on the Ile de la Cite , Nancy gasped at the array of roses and chrysanthemums ? and of exotic tropical flowers selling at a hundred dollars the stalk . " Each one is perfect ! " she exclaimed . " Naturally , " the proprietor replied . " Perfection is our metier . " There are not so many lovers along the quays of the Seine as there used to be , nor clochards , those bleary , ragged tramps who once slept beneath the bridges . Now nobody sleeps under the bridges except young foreigners , who are equipped with sleeping bags , guitars , revolutionary sentiments ? and purses filled by indulgent fathers . During my Paris visit the youth of France was working seriously on its politics . The presidential election was taking place , with Valery Giscard d'Estaing , third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francois Mitterrand and a Greek chorus of minor candidates . Late one night , near the church of St. Germain des Pres , I came on platoons of muscular young men dashing through the streets . They carried rolls of paper , brushes , and buckets of paste as they darted like troops in an enemy city from doorway to doorway . They were posting pictures of their candidates on the hoardings provided by the government for this purpose . As soon as one group put up posters , another would dart out of a darkened street and cover them with pictures of their own man . As Giscard was 498  |p503  masked by Mitterrand , as Mitterrand was obliterated by Jacques Chirac , the Gaullist candidate , the people seated at the sidewalk tables of the Cafe des Deux Magots lifted cheer after jovial cheer . A day or two later , strolling in the Rue Jacob , near the Seine , I encountered Francois Mitterrand , the next president of France . He had thrown a tan raincoat over his shoulders , he carried a book in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , he was enjoying the mild bright pause between showers . He was quite alone and quite undisturbed . Earlier rulers of France kept their persons safe by bribing the Vikings , who had invaded Normandy in the ninth century , to attack others , leaving the monarch in peace . In A.D. 911 , Charles the Simple gave the Viking leader Rollo the rich lands that are now Normandy , and the hand of his daughter in marriage . This transaction worked out well ; Rollo was baptized and became a fervent Christian lawgiver and builder . It was he who undertook the first important works to stabilize the Seine , dredging , diking , and draining the marshes . In 1848 work was begun to improve the navigability of the river below Paris . Embankments and new locks were built . In 1850 barges and other small craft carried 500,000 metric tons of material to Paris . Today some 30 million metric tons of river freight pass through Paris in a typical year . THE SEINE is not a turbulent river . From the source to the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the descent from Marcilly , where the first of 25 locks is located , is 220 feet . Above Marcilly the wind may cause the Seine to flow upstream , as I discovered when I rented a rowboat at Romilly and found myself rowing as fast as I could in order to stay in the same place . Below Rouen , tides run in from the Channel at up to 5 knots , fast enough to make downstream progress a questionable proposition for old , slow rivercraft . Nancy and I were carried out of Paris aboard a sturdy British boat called Rosehearty . We boarded her at her mooring near the Pont de la Concorde at the invitation of her cordial owners , Alan and Joan Davis of Yarmouth , Isle of Wight . A Frenchwoman  |p504  who lived aboard a neighboring barge joined us for a sundowner . From the deck of Rosehearty the snarling combat of rushhour traffic along the quays and in the Place de la Concorde sounded like the sough of wind in treetops . " Ah , " said the Frenchwoman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " how one hates to fall overboard into the city each morning ! " Next day , as we chugged sedately downriver beneath the bridges between the steep riverbanks , Paris looked like a buried city , with only the roofs visible from the water . Entering the first great curves of the lower Seine , gazing at the bluffs of Saint-Germainen-Laye and the forest beyond it , I understood for the first time that the Seine is a natural barrier . For centuries it separated rival Celtic tribes on its left and right banks . THERE WAS little opportunity for such musings when Rosehearty was under way . Our helmsman , Lt. Anthony Walton of the Royal Navy , on leave from duty aboard one of Her Majesty 's aircraft carriers , maneuvered our handy craft through a swarm of barges . These flatboats are home to a floating nation ; the family aboard is as likely to be Flemish or German as French , for Europe 's rivers are connected by a vast system of canals that makes it possible to pass from the North Sea to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that moves the rudder . We passed barges on which children played on swing sets and teeterboards , on which women hung out the wash , on which men worked on the motors of cars lashed to the humped decks of their vessels . A bit farther downriver , at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine , we steamed past a city of barges ? there was a church aboard one barge , a clinic on another . The barges carry everything , picking up loads at depots at Le Havre , Rouen , and the Quai d'Austerlitz in Paris . Tying up alongside a huge barge , we were warned by one of the crew , who spoke French with a vigorous German accent , to be careful not to fall into the pool of liquid in the center of the deck . " It 's mud from the river bottom , stickier than honey , and it will suck you down , " he cautioned . His barge worked with a dredge , keeping the river at its proper depth ; in this 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum draft for boats is 3.5 meters ( 11.5 feet ) . It is a wondrous thing to see the barges , two or three of them lashed together and pushed by a single tug , as they negotiate the curves of the river . Anthony taught us that a blue flag flown on the starboard side of a barge 's wheelhouse is a request for oncom ing traffic to pass to the left , instead of going by on the right in the usual way . This permits barges to keep to the inside curve of the river , reducing the amount of maneuvering needed . The steersman often ca n't see the prow of a string of barges hundreds of feet ahead of the wheelhouse ; he steers by radar . Even more wondrous it is to follow such a behemoth into a lock : The boats chug in , fenders down to keep from smashing against the sides of the structure , and then the lower gates are opened , the water gushes out , and several hundred tons of barge sink majestically ( or rise if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next level of the river , and the craft motors on . OUR DAYS on the river passed like a dream . To watch the setting sun pour molten light on the water of some placid anchorage was to understand what it was the Impressionist painters were trying to capture on their canvases . The Seine is the mother of Impressionism : perhaps the Honfleur painter Eugene Boudin began it in 1858 , when he sat 17-year-old  |p507  Claude Monet at the water 's edge and commanded him to paint the light . Monet spent the rest of a long life in the attempt . He painted the Cathedral of Notre Dame at Rouen more than 30 times in order to observe the changes in the light playing over its face . The Allied air forces , attempting to destroy the bridges across the Seine in 1944 , inadvertently bombed Rouen 's cathedral and many of its other historic churches and buildings . A great fire in 1940 had ravaged the city , and whole quarters of halftimbered Norman houses were destroyed . Bernard Toutain , a Rouennais who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat of France , returned to find his beloved city in ashes . " I had been in Munich , a French prisoner among Germans , when that city was firebombed , " Bernard told me . " The pavement melted , the air caught fire , many died . Rouen was no more beautiful than Munich , her dead women and children were equally innocent . War itself is the enemy . " Happily , Rouen has been rebuilt , and the crew of Rosehearty wandered through her streets among happy throngs . At a brasserie on the old marketplace we feasted on the plateau de fruits de mer ? oysters , clams , sea snails , periwinkles , crayfish , prawns . From the window we could see the new Church of St. Joan of Arc , shaped like a wimple , next to the place where the saint was burned .  |p510  Joan was not canonized until 1920 . Was n't that rather late ? " Well , " said a man opening oysters outside the brasserie , " she caused a lot of trouble , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Norman . " A thick fog settled on the Seine at Duclair , pinning Rosehearty to her mooring , and we sadly took our leave of her . Nancy and I wandered at leisure by car and afoot along the bank . At Jumieges , blackbirds spilled from the shattered towers of this old monastery , one of the most haunting ruins in France . A few miles farther on , we lit a candle for a devout friend in the 15th-century Church of Notre Dame at Caudebec-enCaux . Henry IV called this masterpiece of flamboyant Gothic " the most beautiful chapel in the kingdom " ; the centuries have confirmed his judgment . At Villequier we discussed with M. Claude Nanquette , manager of the Musee Victor Hugo , the melancholy events of September 4 , 1843 , when Leopoldine , daughter of Victor Hugo , drowned with her young husband , Charles Vacquerie , while boating on the Seine . From the windows of the Maison Vacquerie , we could imagine the gay young people , setting off with parasol and picnic hamper in the glitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , but Leopoldine drowned , and his other daughter , Adele , died mad , " said Monsieur Nanquette . " Only a poet , perhaps , could have borne such sorrow . " At the Abbey of St. Wandrille , high above the Seine in the Caux country , we passed through the gates as the Angelus was sounding . The abbey was founded in 649 by Wandrille , a nobleman renowned for his beauty and skill at arms , who decided on his wedding day to consecrate his life to God . Destroyed by the Vikings in the ninth century , the abbey was rebuilt in the tenth ; after the revolution it again fell into ruin . The Benedictine monks of the abbey knew prosperity , terror , exile . Always they returned . On this gray night , beneath the roof of the present church , we listened to them lift their voices in Gregorian chant . 510 The monks were very old men , most of them , but when I closed my eyes and listened to their joyous praise of their Maker , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ease along the Seine . On market day in Pont-Audemer , a town at the edge of the Marais Vernier , the marsh that lies between the Seine and its last tributary , the Risle , we heard a tale of witchcraft : A man in a village near Honfleur had died when a sorcerer put a curse on him . Animals perished of witchcraft all the time . The marsh is important , for Norman sorcery makes much use of the spit of frogs , who live in boggy places . Soon the mood changed . Lunching with us in the Cafe des Sports , a man I shall call Francois , a former mayor of a nearby village , recounted the circumstances of his marriage : " It was 1939 . My class was about to be conscripted . I was in love with Marie . My grandmother said : You may be killed by the Germans , so you must marry and have a son quick . ' My beloved Marie , in my arms before I march away ! I thought . Not Marie , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty girl who is poor , but you must marry someone more suitable . Tomorrow morning you will be wed to Annette ; it 's all arranged . And mind you leave a son behind you ! ' " And did he obey his grandmother and marry Annette ? " Of course , " said Francois . " I was young , a romantic . I was sure I would be killed in the war , and Marie would spend her life in mourning . Instead , she had five children of her own , I have a son I love , and I became the mayor . One must accept fate . " This willingness to accept fate , to float on the tides of history , is surely the reason why civilization is such a hardy growth on the fertile banks of the Seine . To say good-bye to the river , I returned to Honfleur , at the mouth of the Seine , my favorite town in France . During the Hundred Years ' War the town was twice taken and twice lost by the English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English because of their habit of taking the name of the Lord in vain , were driven out for good in 1450 , the people of the Honfleur waterfront decided that they must have a church to replace the one the war had destroyed along with much of the rest of the town . The boat carpenters of Honfleur , employing their usual tools and timbers cut from the nearby forest of Touques , built the Eglise Sainte-Catherine in the form of two overturned ships ' hulls . In similar hulls , the men of Honfleur would touch Brazil and Newfoundland , found French America , follow the flight of migrating birds to the far reaches of the Pacific . In similar hulls , their Northmen ancestors came into the estuary . In similar hulls , the men of today , such as Daniel Le Cesle of the Annick , raise up new generations with a living earned by toil and danger . Standing within the great fragrant old wooden structure of Sainte-Catherine , one does not ask as in the great stone cathedrals , " How did men make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , I see how they did it ! " And in seeing one 's fellow men , so small in the distance of time , one understands how the Seine , which is no more than the tears of a nymph where it rises in a forest far away , can become in its long course the symbol of a civilization whose mysterious light no human eye or hand has ever quite captured .
