CHICKENHAWK by Robert Mason <P> Viking ; 339 pages ; $17.75 <P> In World War II , American soldiers darted across Europe in Jeeps and swarmed ashore on to Pacific islands from LSTs . By the 1960s , G.I.s were commuting to and from action in Viet Nam by helicopter . The chopper , in fact , is symbolic of that war , and memories of ' Nam still echo with the beat of rotor blades . <P> This memoir by former Army Pilot Robert Mason recalls the violent , deafening , treetop world of 1,000 Viet Nam helicopter missions . Chickenhawk begins with a Florida farm boy 's daydream of levitating above the fields and ends with the veteran suspended in horror and disillusionment . <P> Helicopter tactics were still in the experimental stage when Warrant Officer Mason arrived at An Khe in 1965 . Nobody knew much of anything except that Viet Nam was , as Mason writes , " a good place to buy stereo equipment . " For months the Army suffered high chopper losses because pilots flew at low levels over Viet Cong-held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men died because promised chest-armor plates for their cockpits failed to arrive . To exist , Mason learned to adapt to " the details of the job at hand , no matter how bizarre . " <P> Although they were officially prohibited from flying more than four hours a day , pilots often were at the controls for eight . Mason says that he once flew 20 out of 24 hours . Fatigue fogged the senses , and the view of combat through the Plexiglas became hallucinatory . He thought about bullets coming " through my bones and guts and through the ship and never stopping . A voice echoed in the silence . . . ' Go ! Go ! Go ! ' " <P> Like most of his buddies , Mason had believed that all Asians were unworthy of U.S. salvation . But in a smoldering village , he began to understand the hubris of Western technology . Of an ancient water wheel , he writes : it was " as efficient as any device our engineers could produce . The knowledge that built it was being systematically destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fighting intensified , his Huey was frequently an ambulance , and too often a hearse stacked with corpses . " The smell of death seeped out of the zippered pouches and made the living retch , " he writes . " No matter how fast I flew , the smell would not blow away . " Mason suffered from insomnia , blackouts and nightmares about dying children . He let mosquitoes bite him because malaria was a fail-safe ticket home . When he witnessed two Marines being blown up by a claymore mine they were setting , he reflected , " What 's next in this carnival ? " <P> Agonizingly suspended between his fear of death and his passion for duty , the " chickenhawk " took the conflicts home . When a clerk in Hawaii called him a murderer , he felt that she was talking about someone else . Daily quarts of whisky could not erase the awful memories and their replays . Mason lived in a private , disconnected world that finally crashed in 1981 when he was arrested for and convicted of dope smuggling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalls . Chickenhawk , with its vertical plunge into the thickets of madness , will stun readers as well . <P> - By J.D. Reed
