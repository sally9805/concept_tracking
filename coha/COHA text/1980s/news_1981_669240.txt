Visitors to far northern Finland will find astonishments and delights not least of which is the cuisine . Finnish food is excellent , probably because the Finns themselves enjoy gracious living and dining. // In every city , town , and hamlet one discovers gastronomic surprises served with smiling efficiency , from the small , intimate bistro and country inn to the more lavish , beautifully appointed rooms for dining in the hotels in larger cities like Helsinki , the capital , and Turku , the former capital. // One soon learns , too , that the Finns have many fine dishes indigenous to their country. // This Scandinavian nation has its northern area  --  Finnish Lapland  --  above the Arctic Circle , and its southern and western boundaries are the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea . On the east , is the USSR. // Reindeer is eaten with relish by the Finns ; fine beef is also part of their cuisine . Much of the native culinary art centers around fish , naturally. // Happy is the visitor who arrives about mid-July , in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh dill and , in my experience , the best in the world. // Thick soups are standard fare everywhere , and they are so rich and filling they often take the place of a meal. // Almost everyone in this agreeable country shares the American passion for sweets , and foreign visitors can depend upon finding a great variety of delicious homemade pastries everywhere from the colorful outdoor markets in virtually every city and town , to the menus of the most elegant hotels. // Matti Viherjuuri generously made available to me some of her extensive knowledge of Finland ' s cuisine . She is a member of the Societe des Gastronomes Finlandais and is honorary chairman of the Chevalier de la Chaine de Rotissuers. // She spoke of seasonal dishes and delicacies ; and delicious fish for export which will be a special treat for winter visitors . These are turbot , whitefish , and tiny sardinelike vendace , all of which spawn only in winter. // Their roe is eaten with onion , pepper , sour cream , toast . Pike , bream , salmon  --  usually pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative , the whitefish , are some other delicious always-available fish. // Ways of preparing them outdoors in summer are many ; they are smoked , grilled , or cooked on a board . My Finnish friends told me planked whitefish should definitely be tried. // Even a trout caught in a fish tank is great , grilled by a fire . The fish is placed close to the fire but not too close , just enough to see that it is done quickly and keeps the juices inside. // Finland has hundreds of lakes , and summer visitors should plan to take a lake excursion in eastern Finland to taste freshly caught fish cooked on the lakeshore. // The old Finns knew nothing about nutrition but they appreciated the good qualities of fresh fish . They ate the entire fish  --  bones , head , fins and all. // Another old Finnish tradition is raw fish . Finland , like Japan , is a country whose people consume a great deal of raw fish , pickled in various ways or salted . This is something special a visitor will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes which Finns get in June . They are " the size of a bird ' s egg and are cookedin their skins , in water seasoned with dill , and eaten with lightly salted butter and herring. " // Speaking of herring , " silakka , " the Baltic herring which can be prepared at least a hundred different ways , is perhaps the most popular of the fish available year round. // Summer is the time the Finns really come alive to the fullest extent of their extraordinary vitality , for summer is so short it is precious , a time of the year when the sun shines all day and doesn ' t set until close to midnight , and light appears again in just a few hours. // Along with the tiny new potatoes , June brings strawberries . Later come blueberries from the forests and black and red currants , cloudberries  --  a Finnish delight  --  raspberries , lingonberries , even cranberries. // Typically Finnish , too , is the summer ' s first vegetable , " apposet " or pea pods , which are cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an artichoke leaf. // This is the season , too , for early mushrooms , as common in Finland as oranges in Florida and California . From childhood , Finns are instructed by their elders how to distinguish the edible from the poisonous , since there are 500 varieties , about 200 of which are the most desirable and meant to be eaten with pleasure. // Chanterelles come first ; and in autumn the hunt is on in earnest , for whole families go mushroom hunting . After returning from a day in the forest , stooping , searching , picking , the adults sort out the mushrooms according to type , and clean them , instructing the children meanwhile. // The old-timers , the real mushroom fans , usually rush right into the kitchen to heat up the frying pan. // Mushrooms can be preserved and frozen , put in sauces , soups , salads , or creamed . They have form and taste and personality and that exotic foresty fragrance , well worth the hunt. // Most Americans know and enjoy Finnish bread called Finn brod but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finnish choice of cheeses is limited. // Visitors to Helsinki will find a full range of them , as well as numerous other delicacies , indigenous products and imports , in the excellent and extensive food department of Stockman ' s Department Store , one of the most interesting places to visit on every tourist itinerary. // When autumn suddenly turns to winter and the lakes freeze over , the Finns begin to think about their most serious eating time  --  Christmas. // Finns admit shamefacedly that they gorge themselves at the Christmas meal , which is a traditional feature in every household as , indeed , it is in ours. // The Christmas meal starts with cold cuts , herring in different sauces , and with different decorations , slightly salted salmon , and , in some families , the traditional pastry and bouillon follow , after which the main dish , ham , appears. // Side dishes include peas and prunes and a rutabaga casserole , often a potato casserole , too , and frequently a liver casserole and even one of carrots . Dessert may be fruit salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
