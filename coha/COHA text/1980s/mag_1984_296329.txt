A SUNDAY IN THE COUNTRY Directed by Bertrand Tavernier Screenplay by Colo Tavernier and Bertrand Tavernier <P> An innocent eye , an intelligent heart : these are the gifts that nature bestows on her artists . As a painter of the second stature , Monsieur Ladmiral ( Louis Ducreux ) possesses each gift in decorous sufficiency . His eye captures moments with piercing clarity ; his heart helps him appreciate their evanescence . For old Monsieur is going to die soon . Now each day is unique-even this summer Sunday at his country home about 1912 , when his children and grandchildren will come to visit , and memories will flip by like snapshots from a lost family album . <P> Nothing much happens in this gentle , acute , hugely affecting film from French Director Bertrand Tavernier ( The Clockmaker , Coup de Torchon ) . Monsieur wakes , engages in a mild battle of wills with his sere housekeeper , dresses for the arrival of his son Gonzague ( Michel Aumont ) . Gonzague 's stern wife ( Genevieve Mnich ) lectures Monsieur fondly on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cat is always nice " - and Monsieur replies with a smile that might be a wince . His two grandsons make an ordinary nuisance of themselves . His granddaughter , the lovely Mireille ( Katia Wostrikoff ) , watches today 's dinner spin on its fireplace rotisserie and gets caught up a tree . Suddenly , like a sunburst in the middle of a daydream , Monsieur 's daughter Irne ( Sabine Azema ) motors in , abustle with gaiety and impish reproaches . She takes her papa to a country inn for a chat and one lingering waltz before nightfall ; then , as abruptly as she came , Irne drives off to patch up a lovers ' quarrel . Dinner , farewells , and a last reflection for Monsieur on his role as parent and painter . <P> In one sense , this is an unromantic , even radical film . The artist , it suggests , is also a functioning member of society . He need not be a diseased oyster or a frail hothouse plant or an emotional prairie fire that scorches the earth searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a participant in the life of his family , his environment and traditions . And so , like any father , Monsieur can play favorites with his children , finding small pleasure in the weekly visits of his dutiful son , gasping for the breath of fresh life the mercurial Irne brings with her in her in frequent appearances . Like any grandparent , he can pamper or scold the little ones . Like any widower , he can surge into reveries of his dead wife , see her sitting in that chair , her chair . <P> Perhaps this explains Monsieur 's failure , in his own eyes , as an artist . He was too faithful a family man , too attentive a student , too much a gentleman to renounce the academic style and strike out boldly for the terrain charted by the impressionists . " Perhaps I lacked courage , " he confides to Irne . " I thought if I 'd admitted what was original in others I 'd have lost my own little melody . " He is like a Salieri who has taught himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will never be a Mozart . It is not till the end of this Sunday that he realizes the importance of following his own little melody . He puts aside his sofa still life , sets out a fresh blank canvas and ponders his resolution to start anew .
