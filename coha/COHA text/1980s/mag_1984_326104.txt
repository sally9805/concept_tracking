THE TALISMAN by Stephen King and Peter Straub Viking ; 646 pages ; $18.95 <P> There is no point in complaining about The Talisman as if it were a finished product , or even an ordinary novel . In fact it is something far more momentous , the first stage in the construction-the scaffolding and a few truckloads of apparitions , so to speak-of a Steven Spielberg movie . So the publicity blurbs boast . The director of Jaws and E.T . has bought the movie rights for a pot of money . Surely , by the way , this explains the dual authorship . The story 's weight and complexity are not such that it is necessary to have one author shoveling coal while the other steers . But the combined constituencies of King ( Pet Sematary ) and Straub ( Ghost Story ) are a big part of what Spielberg paid for . <P> The Talisman , as Spielberg films go , will very probably be a Poltergeist rather than an E.T. , the Extraterrestrial . Which is to say , a succession of whiz-bang special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . <P> One thing is sure , the movie will not lack for churning , monster-a-minute energy . The plot is the oldest in literature , a quest : confront the Minotaur , find the Holy Grail , follow the yellow brick road . Twelve-year-old Jack Sawyer is sheltering unhappily in an empty New Hampshire tourist hotel , where his mother Lily , a washed-up B-movie queen , is wasting away with cancer . A mysterious old black man named Speedy , who tends a carrousel , hints that if Jack can reach California and find something called the talisman , all will be well . Part of the journeying will be through a parallel world called the Territories , a kind of theme-park Camelot , where " they have magic like we have physics . " Some earthlings have " twinners " there-Jack 's mother is , almost , the dying Queen Laura , and his uncle Morgan , a greedy Hollywood agent , is a medieval menace who lurks in the shadows . <P> Off goes Jack , equipped with a bottle of magic juice that flips him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors ' imaginings come appealingly to life . The air in the Territories is so clear , for instance , that if someone pulls a radish out of the ground , it can be smelled half a mile away . Clownish , somewhat dim-witted werewolves loyally guard flocks of cow/sheep , but prudent householders stay out of their way when the moon is full . <P> The real trouble comes with the mechanical series of adventures King and Straub have invented for Jack to battle through on his way to the talisman . The hoodoos encountered in a rancid roadhouse in New York , a corrupt orphanage in Ohio , and a nuclear-wasted parallel-Nevada in the Territories are maggoty and colorful , but also wearisomely repetitive . The horrors there on the page are visually ingenious , but they never echo in the mind . Jack Sawyer has two unvarying reactions , fearfulness and pluck . The co-written sentences are so gaudy and muscular they seem phony , like the deltoids of a bodybuilder ( " The alligator-thing ran with slow , clumsy , thudding determination . Its eyes sparkled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its scaly chest " ) . <P> Enchantment fails . Was The Lord of the Rings that much better , or was the difference a wondering child sitting on the reader 's lap ? <P> - By John Skow
