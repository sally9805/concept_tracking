With no bitterness but some regret , Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber , 61 , the former magazine editor ( L'Express ) , author ( The American Challenge ) and his country 's leading technophile , stepped down last week as president of the Paris-based World Center for Computer Science and Human Resources . He resigned to protest his government 's decision to use French computers rather than the Apple Macintosh in its ambitious computer-literacy program . Under the plan , which Servan-Schreiber devised in 1984 , France will place computer-learning centers in 36,500 cities , towns , villages and hamlets . Yielding to pressure from France 's computer industry , the ruling Socialist Party rejected Servan- Schreiber 's bid to use the American machines , even though they would have been built in France under license . <P> Servan-Schreiber argues that the French models selected for the program ( a network of inexpensive machines , such as a Thomson , hooked up to larger computers like the Bull Micral ) are not Macintosh 's equal . Said he : " I personally believe that the best machine is the Macintosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a choice of technology . "
