Some vacationers endure winter just to get to the spring skiing - and the sun deck . In the higher elevations in the West it doesn ' t usually begin until April . In the low-lying , mid-Atlantic states , early to mid-March can be the kickoff . As for when it ends , the snow - turning slushy - often outlasts the skiers. // // Here ' s a look at six meccas around the United States : // Mammoth Mountain , Calif . With its 11 , 000-foot summit , Mammoth is to spring snow what Utah is to powder . Its reputation for great skiing until the Fourth of July ( July 28 , 1983 , remains the record closing date ) is unsurpassed . Two prime reasons are the High Sierra ' s ideal conditions for spring snow and Mammoth ' s commitment to grooming , even salting its slopes deep into June and beyond . The result is snow good enough to attract many race training camps and ski testing programs. // As cool nights yield to ever warmer days , people start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 p. m. , so as to enjoy the snow before it becomes too heavy . By 1 p. m. the regulars are on the sun deck enjoying a barbecue , which , of course , is a main reason for spring skiing in the first place . From May 1 on , a $ 20 lift ticket buys a lot of spring skiing at Mammoth. // Mt . Bachelor , Ore . Here ' s another premier spring training site for racing camps and national teams . With frequent April snows , the lifts usually operate through June . The ' ' summit season ' ' begins May 1 , when lift tickets drop from $23 to $16 . Eventually , everybody is skiing off the new detachable summit quad chair . By afternoon , vacationers can mimic the racing teams doing dry-land training below , or they can be sensible and soak in their hotel pool or hot tub . The nearest lodging is 17 miles from the mountain , and Bend is 22 miles , but shuttle buses run regularly. // Like all of these spring skiing centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the hordes of young new devotees , so far there ' s been only one girl , according to a resort spokesman . Clinics and ' ' demo days ' ' take place almost every other spring Saturday . Then on May 14 , there ' s a ' ' pole , pedal , and paddle ' ' triathlon ( skiing , biking , and canoeing ) . And in June there may be an ' ' on-snow bicycle race. ' ' // Timberline Lodge , Ore . Mt . Hood , east of Portland , has the only true summer skiing in the United States . After the winter and spring season ( $18 lift ticket ) , the famous Timberline Lodge opens its summer Palmer chair at the 8 , 500-foot level ( $16 lift ticket ) . From the middle of May to Labor Day , there ' s skiing on ' ' permanent snow fields ' ' that can run as deep as 70 feet . Usually you can ski down to the 6 , 000-foot level , says spokesman Bill Connerly. // Although 60 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are people who don ' t ski at any other time of the year who come to enjoy the scenic above-timberline ' ' cruiser , ' ' Magic Mile . And if you want to learn to snowboard , Timberline has eight instructors who can teach it. // Keystone/Arapahoe Basin , Colo . Summer tans come fast at Arapahoe Basin , where the 12 , 450-foot summit provides North America ' s highest lift-serviced skiing . Riding up the first lift , skiers almost pass over the ever-smoldering barbecue at the Alpen hut ; one whiff and most of them ski directly to the sun deck . Here you ' ll find ' ' the surf club ' ' with deck chairs and Beach Boys music adding to spring skiing ' s special camaraderie - in this case on the Continental Divide. // From late April to the usual closing in mid-June , every weekend is a ' ' spring fling . ' ' Take your pick of various weekend themes , from ' ' Hawaiian luau ' ' and ' ' Cajun ' ' to ' ' Miami Vice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when bought at Colorado King Sooper markets . Snowboarders at Arapahoe have what is called a ' ' half-pipe ' ' carved out of the snow for a sort of bobsled run. // Killington , Vt . The famous ' ' beast of the East ' ' is unchallenged in staying open until the last skier cries ' ' uncle . ' ' Killington ran almost eight months last year before closing June 3 . What allows the East ' s biggest ski resort such durability is awesome snowmaking power . The result is 30-foot-high machine-made mini-glaciers , which massive snow grooming machines claw over , retrieve from the woods and shove back into the paths of tireless hordes of skiers. // Such reconstituted snow is not easy to ski when it reaches Slush-Puppy consistency . Therefore , the smart skiers hit Killington as the sun does on spring mornings - experts bombing the moguls on the steep black diamond trails on Killington peak , mere mortals searching out the good ' ' corn ' ' snow elsewhere. // Entry in this year ' s 27th annual May Day slalom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecue ( which last year had 240 celebrants ) is good for a free lift ticket next season. // Tuckerman Ravine , N.H. Just below New England ' s highest mountain , Mt . Washington , lies a natural snow basin that is as renowned as any in the country . Starting every April , when the Forest Service says it ' s safe and lasting , some years , into July , skiers come from distant points to climb the 2C miles into this giant bowl. // So many come - particularly on traditional reunion days like Memorial Day weekend and Queen Elizabeth ' s birthday ( for Canadians ) - that only the first 86 on a given morning can stay overnight in a designated shelter . For everyone else - and a busy weekend can see 8 , 000 skiers - it ' s ski and hike down the same day. // In February , Tuckerman loyalists were cheered by the National Forest Service ' s refusal to let the privately owned Mt . Washington Cog Railway ( which transports tourists in the summer ) haul skiers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , the railway indicates it will bring skiers up this spring anyway , leaving the Forest Service to decide how it will keep them out. // //
