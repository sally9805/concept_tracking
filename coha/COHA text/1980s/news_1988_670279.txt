NEW YORK  --  The fire sale is under way at Cooper Cos. , but unwary shareholders may find themselves overcome by the smoke . Cooper stock already has taken its lumps this year , slipping to yesterday ' s close of 7 5/8 from about 15 in May . The Palo Alto , Calif. , concern is an enigma in today ' s takeover-scarred market : living proof that putting a " For Sale " sign on a company doesn ' t necessarily bolster the share price . That is because money managers , and possible buyers , apparently are deciding the Cooper units ' value is substantially less than initial glances might indicate . And two recent public filings by the company could add fuel to the skepticism . Last week , Cooper agreed to sell one of its three remaining units , Cooper Surgical , to the Alcon subsidiary of Nestle S.A. for about $325 million . Analysts were underwhelmed by the accord . " The price was on the low side of what we thought they might get , " asserts Larry Haimovitch , medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . " With its financial condition , the company needed a grand-slam home run and got a single . " One down , two to go . Still on the block are the contact-lens division and the company ' s biggest division , Cooper Technicon , which makes automated medical diagnostic systems . Wall Street analysts generally estimate that the lens unit will fetch somewhere around $150 million , including the $40 million that Cooper already has gained from the sale of its U.S. lens-care solutions business . So the questions about Cooper ' s value center on how much management can garner for Technicon . That prospect has some short-sellers licking their chops . The bullish argument for Cooper focuses in part on Technicon ' s cash flow , which analysts estimated earlier this year at as much as $75 million , before interest expenses . The bulls argued that Technicon should be valued at 10 times cash flow , and therefore could sell for as much as $750 million . But Technicon ' s recent 10-Q filing , which includes numbers through the third quarter ended July 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totaled $14. 7 million , before taxes , including a slim $2. 1 million in the fiscal third quarter . The nine-month figure is 54% lower than the year-earlier operating profit . One short-seller , who asked not to be identified , expects Technicon ' s full-year operating profit to total about $18 million ; after depreciation of about $10 million more , cash flow should reach $28 million this year , he adds . So , following the 10 times cash flow guideline , he figures Technicon could sell for less than $300 million . By another measure , the sum in Cooper ' s agreement to sell its surgical unit to Alcon equals about one year ' s revenue . That same method would value Technicon at roughly $470 million . Either valuation could be devastating for Cooper shareholders . By one shortseller ' s estimate , holders of common could be left with very little if the company sells its remaining two units , as management has said it hopes to do . Assuming that Technicon fetches $450 million , common holders would be left with assets valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , $700 million of debt , preferred stock and other costs . A Cooper spokesman won ' t comment on how much the company thinks Technicon can bring . One potential cost raises some eyebrows , as well . In its latest proxy material , Cooper disclosed that it set up an " incentive pool " that would pay management for the sale of each business unit . More than three-quarters of that money is earmarked for the Singer and Sturman families , which control Cooper ' s board . Under the pool ' s guidelines , top officials could receive as much as $13. 4 million , " if the sale is made within certain target time periods " and at set prices . The filing didn ' t disclose prices or time periods . The Sturmans and Singers , who combined own about 15% of Cooper shares outstanding , have some ground to make up to recoup paper losses . The families bought Cooper shares earlier this year at prices in the teens . The Cooper spokesman said the incentive pool was designed " to motivate and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wouldn ' t identify the target prices or times , he said this type of plan is " increasingly commonplace " at companies.  --  - Cooper Cos .
