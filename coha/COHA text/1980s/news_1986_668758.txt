Petitions calling for a Nov. 4 advisory referendum on whether Addison residents want the White Sox to be their home team were filed in the Du Page County suburb Thursday . In addition , organizers of a petition drive aimed at keeping the Sox , the Chicago Bears and any other developers away from Addison and the rest of Bloomingdale Township predicted success in their separate crusade . They want to create a special open-space district in the township , and they said they soon will have enough signatures to ensure a place on the November ballot . Petitions bearing 3 , 094 signatures , almost three times the number needed , were turned in to the Addison village clerk . " Shall a professional sports stadium be built within the corporate limits of the Village of Addison ? " the referendum will read . The referendum is not binding on village officials . Village Clerk Panorea Lekkas said the village will not challenge the signatures on the petitions . Tom Zver , an Addison homeowner who helped organize the petition drive , said that signatures came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed stadium site . Homeowners circulating the petitions reported that " a large majority " of those expressing an opinion on the matter opposed the proposed Sox stadium , he said .

More counting was planned Friday morning , Stapinski said , and the petitions could be turned in later in the day . A portion of Addison , including the Sox ' s land , is in Bloomingdale Township . Passage of the open-space referendum would create a way for the township to condemn and buy up land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the primary target of this open-space program , " Stapinski said . However , noting that the Bears also own land in the township , she said , " I ' m hoping we can get to that , too . " She said that organizers hope to turn in 1 , 000 more signatures than required to give them a wide margin of error in case the petitions are challenged . The two portions of the pro- posed referendum ask voters to give the township the power to acquire land for open space and to issue bonds for the purchases . If the referendum passes , the township could levy a tax of not more than 5 percent of the total assessed property value in the township to pay off the bonds . Libertyville Township in Lake County is the only township in Illinois that has held such a referendum under the new Open Spaces Act . Voters there passed the referendum last year .
