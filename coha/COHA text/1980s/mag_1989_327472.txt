Kenny spent his first two Christmases in the Harlem hospital where his mother abandoned him , in a roomful of babies with AIDS . His third Christmas he spent in an Albany children 's home . There he had the luck to meet his first angel . <P> Gertrude Lewis spent her days driving a city bus and , every other Saturday , volunteering at the Albany home . " I saw this boy with these beautiful eyes , " she recalls , " just looking up and smiling . " She was 47 years old , had never married , never had a family of her own . She decided then and there she would become a foster mother . <P> Now Kenny lies in his crib upstairs in her home , in a house she shares on a tree-lined street , where her heart prepared him room . This nursery is merry with orange walls and pictures and 27 watchful stuffed animals . " It 's going to be hard to lose him , " says Gertrude . <P> What are we to make of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to die ? Surely , she confounds all descriptions of the roaring ' 80s as a morally chintzy stretch of history , where such problems as Kenny 's are greeted with more petulance than pity . In an age of toxic cynicism , Gertrude is a Samaritan : a woman who , in the spacious privacy of her life , went out of her way to help a child who needed her . She is not running for office , not running charity balls and not running away . Perhaps she seems a rare heroine at an end of a decade when the rich got greedier , the poor got needier , and everyone else tended to his own shiny self-interest . <P> But the redeeming truth , to our own surprise , is that Gertrude is in vast company . Last March , Independent Sector , a Washington research and lobbying group , commissioned a Gallup poll to plumb the depths of our charity : What do we give , and why , and who does the giving , and how much ? It turns out that almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , an astounding figure even allowing for the number of people who lie to pollsters . And most are giving more time than ever . These are commitments , not gestures . The average volunteer offers nearly five hours a week , for a total of 19.5 billion hours in 1987  --  the equal , roughly , of 10 million full-time employees . There is something infectious about mercy . <P> And so it is that George Bush , the heir-elect , looks out over the nation and raptly muses about a thousand points of light , savoring the phrase , if not quite understanding it . He did not add that the lights are shining into corners that have grown bleak and dim in the past eight years . And he got the numbers wrong . Out of sight of the Rose Garden , something like 80 million individuals are doing whatever they can to address the problems that politicians are fleeing . <P> Try to draw a profile of the typical do-gooder , and the only thing certain is that it is probably wrong . Volunteer work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the idle rich sponsoring benefits and the young selling cookies . The aggressive , entrepreneurial cast of much modern charity reflects the fact that the largest number of volunteers , according to a J.C . Penney survey , are between the ages of 35 and 49.
