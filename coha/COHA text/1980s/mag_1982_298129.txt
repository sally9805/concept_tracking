During a conversation with Judge William Murray , in an effort to have the child returned to Stuckle , Schmitz confessed that he was the boy 's father . Stuckle claims that Schmitz is also the father of her three-week-old daughter . The scandal will have little impact on Schmitz 's ebbing political fortunes : his state senate seat will be eliminated in November because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
