A few weeks from now , Ted Eriksen , the Mendocino County , Calif. , agricultural commissioner , will publish his annual crop report . It will be seriously in error-not for any lack of meticulousness on Eriksen 's part , but because his bosses will not let him mention marijuana . <P> In last year 's report , Eriksen matter-of-factly stated that pot patches provided far more farm income in Mendocino County-he estimated 1979 's harvest at $90 million-than any other cultivated crop . Says Eriksen : " I thought it was a realistic thing to do . " The county board of supervisors did not : when the smoke cleared , Eriksen had torn the offending page from every copy of his findings and promised never to report on m -- a again . So this year , wine grapes will be called the county 's biggest agricultural moneymaker . But that is a politician 's pipe dream .
