Over the years , California has given the rest of the country everything from health food to a taxpayers ' revolt . Now it has bequeathed another far-reaching legacy to its sister states : a clampdown on auto-emission standards that could help transform the American car and the fuel that makes it run . To the discomfort of U.S. automakers , a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee voted unanimously last week to adopt California 's strict limits for the 1990s as the law of the land . The measure , which seemed certain to win House approval , would cut existing levels of tail-pipe pollutants as much as 60% from 1994 to 1996 and could phase out much of the remainder by 2006 . The Senate is considering an even stronger bill . <P> The House proposal brought a swift protest from U.S. carmakers , who contended that the clean-air standards would raise car prices and strain technical resources . The companies argued that auto exhaust is already 96% cleaner than it was before pollution-control measures were introduced two decades ago . Noting that the House limits would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean-air package last summer , General Motors President Robert Stempel asserted , " For our business it would be extremely tough . It went further than the President proposed , and we 're deciding how to handle it . " <P> As predictable as the grumbling from Detroit was the calm reaction in Japan , whose share of the U.S. market has climbed from 15% in 1979 to 25% today . " It 's not that tough technologically , but we 'll need some lead time , " said a Japanese auto-company official . He added that the new standards would raise sticker prices " only marginally " because Japanese firms typically rely on thinner profit margins than their U.S. counterparts . <P> The House vote marked a truce between feuding Democrats John Dingell of Michigan , a dogged opponent of auto regulation , and California 's Henry Waxman , a champion of even stricter standards for clean air . The compromise proposal would cut emissions of nonmethane hydrocarbons , a key ingredient in smog , which can now average no more than 0.41 gram per mile for a carmaker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.25 gram per mile on all cars by 1996 ; the output of nitrogen oxide , another source of smog , would be required to fall from 1 gram per mile to 0.4 gram . Unless the Environmental Protection Agency ruled otherwise , automakers would then be ordered to slash the reduced levels in half by 2006 . <P> Car companies could meet such standards by upgrading their current pollution controls rather than developing expensive new systems . For example , the bill would require that catalytic converters , now guaranteed to be effective for 50,000 miles , be beefed up to last 100,000 miles . Other alterations would range from adding a microchip to monitor a car 's pollution controls to expanding a charcoal canister that catches evaporating gasoline fumes when a car 's engine is off . The EPA estimates that such improvements could raise car prices as much as $200 by 1996 and $500 more by 2006.
