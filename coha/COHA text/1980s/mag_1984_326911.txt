To the Editors : <P> <P> Brian Mulroney , Canada 's new Prime Minister , incorporates the best of both Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale with none of their shortcomings WORLD , Sept. 17 . Canadians knew a good thing when they saw him . <P> <P> Steve Lubeck <P> San Carlos , Calif . <P> <P> After the Trudeau Liberals , the election of Mulroney is a breath of fresh air . Finally Canadians have a government that represents all regions , coast to coast . <P> Stephen L. Shapiro <P> Calgary , Alta . <P> <P> Brian Mulroney will become what Pierre Trudeau so desperately wanted to be , a world-class statesman . Whereas Trudeau will be remembered for his aloofness , his coarse behavior and his plundering of the public purse , Mulroney will most likely make his mark by restoring social and economic balance to Canada . <P> <P> Robin West <P> Star City , Sask . <P> <P> Mulroney 's victory can be credited largely to timing ; had he run for office in the early 1970s in the midst of Trudeaumania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morawetz <P> Toronto <P> In spite of what you consider the " linguistic absurdities " of Quebec , you will find that an English-speaking Canadian is more at home in that province than a French-speaking citizen is anywhere else in Canada . <P> <P> Andr Richard <P> Rouyn , Que . <P> <P> Blood on the Campaign Trail <P> The maiming and bloodletting on the current political scene NATION , Sept. 17 can only weaken the vital processes by which we govern ourselves . How can the candidates ever recover from the personal and public injury they heap upon each other ? If we are to survive as a great republic , we must have the best , not the beastliest , from everyone . <P> <P> Edgar E. Dickey <P> Appleton , Wis . <P> <P> The polls keep reminding us that the President is maintaining the confidence of most Americans . A friend of mine , quite taken by the statistics , told me , " I am not going to vote against those figures . " That is his right , but I am bothered by what persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ky . <P> <P> I was surprised by your idiotic assertion that Walter Mondale comes across to his audience as a stiff and uninspiring speaker . Give the man a little credit . He knows the issues inside out and is willing to discuss them headon . The same can not be said of Ronald Reagan . <P> <P> Jon P. Larson Yakima , Wash . <P> <P> Pulpit in Politics <P> When President Reagan asserts that it is perfectly legitimate to intertwine politics and religion NATION , Sept. 17 , he really means politics and Christianity . If he were a Jew or a Buddhist or a Muslim , he might feel different . But then he would not be President . <P> <P> Garth Ware <P> Encinitas , Calif . <P> <P> Contrary to the glib remarks of some contemporary politicians and preachers , religious freedom for all was not a cornerstone of American democracy . The Puritans in England , for example , went to the New World because they believed it was a place where they might have religious freedom , but only for themselves . Wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they permitted absolutely no dissent from their own religious and political beliefs . <P> <P> Paul Carano
