The origins of the .22-cal. revolver that was used to shoot President Reagan are in Sontheim , West Germany . A picturesque town built along a tributary of the Danube , Sontheim is the home of Rohm GmbH , a 74-year-old firm that makes drilling equipment and cheap handgun parts . West Germans have little use for Rohm weapons . The country 's gun ownership laws are strict , and the relatively few people who do qualify to possess handguns tend to choose Gun Seller Goldstein better-made and more expensive models . Thus , most Rohm gun parts-perhaps $1 million worth a year , although company officials refuse to be exact - are shipped through Bremen and Hamburg to the U.S. , where there is one pistol for every four citizens , and where there is a flourishing market for cheap " Saturday night specials . " Last year the U.S. imported 298,689 foreign handguns , most of them from Italy and West Germany , and 3.1 million gun parts . <P> American law closely regulates the importing of entire guns . But there are far fewer restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames . <P> RG Industries , Inc. , which is partly controlled by Heinrich and Giinter Rohm of the German firm , employs about 200 people to do that kind of assembly work at a shabby white concrete building in the garment district of northwest Miami . The cheap alloy frame is smoothed with a file and then placed on an assembly line where the barrel and German parts are inserted . Then the metal is tinted a dark blue . RG Industries last year sold 190,000 such weapons , making it the nation 's fifth largest handgun producer . <P> Because of its short ( 1-in. ) barrel the model RG 14 revolver that Hinckley used can not be sold legally in the Miami area . The one that Hinckley bought , serial number L731332 , was shipped by Southern Gun distributors of nearby Opa-Locka , Fla. , directly to Rocky 's Pawn Shop on Elm Street in Dallas . This cluttered emporium , only a quarter of a mile from the site where President John Kennedy was shot 17 years ago , has a sticker on the door that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAUSE GARBAGE . In the window a red , green , blue and black sign advertises .22-cal. revolvers for $47 . <P> " Hinckley did everything required to buy a gun , " says Isaac " Rocky " Goldstein , 70 , a cigar-chomping , gray-haired man who has run the shpp for 51 years . " People are going to blame us for selling the gun that shot the President , but we have no way of knowing . We do n't even remember him . " <P> Goldstein , who also sold the small handguns that were used in a series of gang shootings in New York City 's Chinatown in 1978 , has been shaken by events , however , and now says he is considering getting out of the gun business . <P> Hinckley purchased the ammunition that was used at another pawn shop , this one in Lubbock , Texas . The type of bullet he chose was interesting-and frightening . The cartridges were Devastators , made by Bingham Ltd. of Norcross , Ga . These projectiles , akin to dumdum bullets , contain a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least twelve times as much as ordinary .22-cal. slugs .
