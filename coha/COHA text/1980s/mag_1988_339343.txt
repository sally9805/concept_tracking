Yousef Yagoub , 30 , a tomato farmer and father of four , sleeps on a dirty piece of cardboard , the muddy waters of the Nile slapping menacingly near his feet . Before the floods , he and his family lived in a flimsy hut made of tree branches . Now only the roof is left , barely poking above the water about 50 yards offshore . " Life , " he says , " is too difficult . " <P> For centuries the Nile has brought life to Sudan 's impoverished inhabitants . But torrential thunderstorms this summer have turned the river into a killer . More than 8 inches of rain  --  twice the average for an entire year  --  fell on Sudan in 13 hours last month . Meanwhile , a seasonal surge of water was heading north from central Africa . The combination sent the river raging over its banks , killing nearly 100 people and leaving 1.5 million homeless . In Khartoum , the capital , sewage-contaminated floodwater swept through squatters ' camps , destroying thousands of homes . Farther north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and rail lines were swamped , preventing relief shipments from getting through . According to aid officials , more than a hundred people starve to death every day . Many more are so weak from hunger they can barely crawl . <P> Sudan has more problems besides fickle weather . For five years , the government of Africa 's largest country ( more than three times the size of Texas ) has been paralyzed by a bloody civil war against secessionist guerrillas in the south . Since 1986 , Sudan has been ineligible for loans from the International Monetary Fund because of an inability to service its $12 billion debt . In April , Prime Minister Sadiq el Mahdi 's failure to deal with the country 's accumulating crises brought down his second government in two years . As if all those woes were not enough , a plague of locusts is threatening to wipe out the country 's meager crops of millet and sorghum . <P> Perhaps the most intractable of the country 's troubles is the war in the south , pitting the local African population , largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the north . Former President Gaafar Nimeiri , who was overthrown in a popular uprising in 1985 , aggravated the existing religious and racial differences by imposing a set of harsh Islamic laws that call for floggings and amputations for criminal offenses even by non-Muslims . Abolition of the laws is a key demand of the Sudanese People 's Liberation Army , whose antigovernment rebels control much of the rural south . <P> Although Mahdi has relaxed enforcement of the laws , he has yet to void or replace them because they are supported by the fundamentalist National Islamic Front , an increasingly powerful member of his fragile ruling coalition . Early this month , the Sudanese Cabinet approved a new and stricter code of Islamic law , or Shari'a , but it has yet to be passed in parliament . In the meantime , the fighting has forced at least 500,000 southerners to flee to Khartoum . Each side in the civil war has accused the other of manipulating food shipments to famine victims as a weapon to gain support in the conflict . A Christian member of parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mosques while those who complained were left standing in the water . "
