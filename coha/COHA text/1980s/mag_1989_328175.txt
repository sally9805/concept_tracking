Despite repeated furious attacks , mujahedin rebels were no closer to capturing the city of Jalalabad last week . They seemed to be suffering from disorganization as well as an inability to pull off major assaults . In one battle last week , rebel artillery pounded the Soviet-backed government 's positions at the city 's airport for hours at a time , but the several hundred guerrillas who mustered to rush the defenses never got going  --  the attack bogged down under return fire and arguments within their own ranks over how to attack across several hundred yards of open ground . <P> When tanks and MiG aircraft zeroed in on their positions , the rebels fell back , taking an alarming number of casualties along the way . Reviewing the failed encounter , a frustrated Rahim Wardak , the battlefront commander of the National Islamic Front for Afghanistan , concluded that the battle that began more than three weeks ago " is turning into a stalemate .
