The sky was clear last Monday morning as the Air Force 's crack flying team soared above the Nevada desert , practicing its stunts , which have caused gasps at aerial shows for nearly 30 years . At exactly 9:55 a.m. the four Thunderbird pilots went into a " line-abreast loop , " a maneuver in which they roar along , wingtip to wingtip , about 100 ft. off the ground , zoom up to 2,500 ft. , loop backward into a dive at 400 m.p.h. , then pull out when they get back to 100 ft . This time they did not pull out . One jet hit the ground and the other three , locked into their now fatal formation , followed within a tenth of a second . They exploded in a ball of flame that one witness likened to napalm explosions he had seen in Viet Nam . Dead were Major Norman L. Lowry III , 37 , the Thunderbirds ' leader , and Captains Willie Mays , 32 , Mark E. Melancon , 31 , and Joseph Peterson , 32 . <P> Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Force 's finest . Their T-38 Talon twin-jet trainers are so easy to steer that flyers call them " baby buggies , " and the line-abreast loop , spectacular as it looks , is a fairly routine maneuver . One speculation : the leader may have misjudged his altitude or speed , and the other three duplicated his error . Thunderbird Capt . Dale Cook was flying solo that day . Says he : " I really ca n't speculate on what may have gone wrong . When you are flying in formation you are not just watching the leader . You watch your instruments , air speed , altitude , the other aircraft and where you are relative to everything else . " An Air Force board of inquiry will take weeks to determine the " probable cause , " and officers are not ruling out a mid-air collision , though eyewitness accounts contain no hint of one . <P> Some of the 80 shows the Thunderbirds had been scheduled to perform this year in the U.S. will probably be canceled . The Air Force , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks and deaths . Seventeen pilots have been killed in accidents since the Thunderbirds began flying in May 1953 , two last year . But the Thunderbirds have enthralled 154 million spectators in all 50 states and 45 foreign countries . Overseas , they demonstrate U.S. aerial prowess ; at home , they serve as a flying recruiting poster . Says Secretary of the Air Force Verne Orr : " There will be criticism , that 's inevitable . But it wo n't lead to abandonment of the Thunderbirds . "
