The five-martini lunch <P> Japanese businessmen last week turned their abundant energies to bonenkai , or forget-the-year parties . In restaurants and nightclubs round the country , hostesses entertained them by purring demurely and pouring drinks . The night ended , many men sped off in rented limousines , often leaving behind bills of $1,500 or more . <P> This is all part of kosai-hi , literally entertainment expenses . Japan 's national tax administration estimates that total outlay for company entertainment during the past fiscal year was $13.3 billion , up 11.2% from the previous year . While the Japanese defense budget is .9% of the country 's G.N.P. , corporate wining and dining accounts for 1.2% of total national output . Japanese tax law even permits smaller companies to write off more entertainment than large ones , on the grounds that fledgling firms have more need to grease the corporate skids . <P> In Japan , kosai-hi is the rule . Top executives are expected to spend up to three or four nights a week entertaining-eating in posh restaurants or golfing on lush greens . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertain prospective buyers to help them reach a consensus fast . Says Ryutaro Nohmura , a leading tentmaker : " Kosai-hi is nothing less than the lubricant for our enormous business machine , the very source of our economic vitality . " <P> Some executives insist that entertaining can be a hard day 's night . The president of an Osaka chemical company complains that he is forced to " go completely dry " on weekends . " Otherwise my health would be endangered . " <P> But kosai-hi has its critics . The government earlier this year proposed to levy stiff taxes on corporate expenditures but then relented under pressure from the business community . Its final solution : tax the portion of kosai-hi that exceeds a corporation 's entertainment expenditures in the previous year . <P> That is hardly a radical solution , but kosai-hi supporters explain that the business of Japan is business . Says Tentmaker Nohmura : " A three-martini lunch is fine , but why not make it four or five ? Nobody will question the bill so long as it helps business . " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
