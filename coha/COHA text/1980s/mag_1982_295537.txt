Conducting global diplomacy on Manhattan 's East Side <P> Ever since he took over as Secretary of State , George Shultz has been pinned down in his Washington office by the crossfire in Lebanon . " I ca n't remember when I last spent so long in the same time zone , " jokes the former globetrotting corporate executive . Finally , last week , he found a way to tend to the simmering dilemmas of East-West relationships as well as the pressing problems of the Middle East while staying close to home . At the United Nations to address the 37th session of the General Assembly , Shultz conducted a diplomatic shuttle among more than 30 foreign ministers-all without leaving Manhattan 's East Side . <P> The centerpiece of the whirlwind week was Shultz 's first official meeting with Andrei Gromyko . The Soviet Foreign Minister has met with nine American Secretaries of State during his 25 years in office . Since he speaks English fluently , he did not ask to have Shultz 's remarks translated , but he did reply in Russian . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their three-hour meeting , Gromyko gave a grim assessment of Soviet-American relations . Shultz , in turn , pressed Gromyko on Moscow 's intervention in Poland , Afghanistan and Cambodia , and on use of biological and chemical weapons . The conference produced few concrete results ; the main accomplishment was keeping businesslike discussions alive and agreeing to meet again this week . <P> Such a dialogue is important in reducing the uncertainty that the aging Soviet leadership feels about Reagan . Despite the President 's assertion at his press conference last week that the Soviets " have a pretty good understanding as to where we stand , " there are reports that the Kremlin is currently engaged in a top-level debate over whether to try to improve relations with Reagan or to wait until a new Administration comes to power . " Reagan 's rhetoric baffles them , " says Columbia University Soviet Expert Seweryn Bialer , who met last month with Central Committee members . <P> As the President noted last week , Moscow has exercised considerable restraint during his term . Even though Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon , he has not yet reacted to the American military presence there . The Soviets also note that they have refrained from giving full support to Central American liberation movements and from directly invading Poland . " Their policy is still oriented toward a relationship with America , " Bialer feels . A senior Western diplomat in Moscow agrees : " Some Soviet spokesmen have portrayed the relationship as hopeless , but that is not their real thinking . " <P> Gromyko raised with Shultz one of the few vestiges of Soviet-American attempts at cooperation , nuclear arms-control talks , noting that little progress is being made . Negotiators from both countries returned to Geneva last week to resume talks on limiting intermediate-range nuclear forces ( I.N.F. ) in Europe . Strategic arms reduction talks ( START ) set to resume in Geneva this week .
