Called ' ' old growth ' ' by foresters , these 200- to 1 , 200-year-old woodlands contain such tree species as Douglas fir , cedar , spruce , and hemlock . About 6 million acres remain in Washington and Oregon , a tenth of the virgin forest that existed before the coming of white settlers . Old growth contains some of the most valuable timber in the nation , with an aggregate value in the billions of dollars . But its economic worth also lies in other resources such as water and wildlife and in what resource analysts call amenity values : scenic , recreational , and ethical. // // With private stocks cut over , most of the remaining old growth is on public land managed by the US Forest Service ( USFS ) and BLM . While these agencies wrestle with the problem of how much to save , harvesting continues . Most of what has been preserved so far grows in Washington . In neighboring Oregon , old growth is at greater risk . Despite efforts to diversify , the state ' s economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-growth processing . A fraction of Oregon ' s old growth is now protected . At current harvest levels , the rest will be gone in several decades. // Conservationists , who want the majority of existing old growth removed from timber production , base their case on economic and ecological grounds . A growing body of academic and government research has shown that old growth is vital to the health of the region ' s forest ecosystem and hence its economic base . Ancient forests comprise a rich , diverse habitat , which is home to over 100 wildlife species including trout , salmon , and steelhead vital to commercial and recreational fisheries . Recent studies also show that downed and standing old trees store and release nutrients necessary to younger trees ( called second growth ) . // The issue has been complicated by related efforts to protect creatures designated by government scientists as ' ' indicator species ' ' of the health of old growth as a whole . The threat posed by logging to one old-growth denizen , the northern spotted owl , prompted wildlife officials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable acreage to ensure that species ' survival . Industry in turn has represented the resource issue as one of ' ' birds vs. jobs ' ' and has mounted a massive media campaign on this theme , which includes recipes for cooking spotted owls. // Environmentalists say that campaign is an attempt to deflect attention from jobs lost to modernization . Wendell Wood of the Oregon Natural Resources Council argues , ' ' We ' re processing the same amount of timber but with 20 percent fewer workers . The real threat to employment is automation . ' ' Conservationists say they want the timber economy to prosper , but not at the expense of nature . Says Mr. Wood , ' ' In economic terms it makes little sense to run our remaining old growth through the saw . When it ' s gone , mills geared for it will have to close whether it ' s tomorrow or five years from now . To sustain the timber economy , we have to keep some old growth around . To diversify , we have to develop the land for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tourists. ' ' // In resource-dependent states like Oregon , land management is a political football , and old growth was a hot issue in the recent general election . Since more than half of Oregon ' s land is held by the federal government , the administration of the local resource base is also a matter of national attention and concern . At that level both environmentalists and fiscal conservatives complain that USFS and BLM favor and subsidize industrial interests at the expense of the rest of their national constituency. // Bunker Hill became news two years ago when area residents tried to keep BLM from logging 40 acres of the hill ' s old growth , including some trees 500 years old and 8 feet in diameter . BLM manages 2 million acres ( 4 , 000 square miles ) of Oregon forest land in the Oregon and California Railroad ( O &; C ) lands , a federal grant taken back from the railroad at the turn of the century . The Department of the Interior interprets the law governing that system as favoring timber over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s district office refuses to remove any of Bunker Hill ' s old growth from timber production . ' ' Bunker Hill , ' ' says BLM spokesman Don Smurthwaite , ' ' is a symbol of the pressures on land management agencies today . Industry and the preservationist ethic press us from opposite directions , yet we must also work within our management plan and the laws governing our operations . Resource issues have to be resolved at the national level and the resolutions applied to local areas like Bunker Hill , not vice versa. ' ' // The state ' s powerful environmental movement is enlisting Congressional support to overturn what it perceives as BLM ' s overwhelming commodity bias . Jack Desmond of the Oregon Sierra Club says , ' ' Bunker Hill is an infinitesimal fraction of BLM ' s holdings . Their approach on the issue demonstrates how little commitment they have to protecting our natural resources . What they ' ve accomplished is to turn a local issue into a national symbol of what ' s fundamentally wrong with public land management. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , ' ' Bunker Hill isn ' t anything like that . It ' s just one of many small public tracts that a few people want to keep as a personal recreation area . At the same time , they don ' t offer any compromises to help maintain our timber economy. ' ' // Old growth advocates disagree . Says Hal Hushbeck of the Bunker Hill Task Force , ' ' It may have started as a simple fight to preserve a beautiful spot a lot of local folks like to visit , but in the process we ' ve learned what old growth means to everyone . Now there ' s a commitment on our part to work for all of Oregon ' s natural heritage. ' ' // //
