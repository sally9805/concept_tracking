The freighter of the future will skim across the water at nearly 60 m.p.h. , as fast as Don Johnson 's speedboat in Miami Vice . But the craft will be 265 ft. long and carry as much as 1,000 tons of cargo . Last week the Japanese government decided to develop such a freighter for commerce between Japan and its Asian neighbors . <P> The proposed Techno-Superliner , 2 1/2 times as fast as any current container ship , would be propelled by water jets and powered by gas-turbine engines . Advocates of the liner ( estimated cost : $79 million ) hope it will revive Japan 's flagging shipyards . Further in the future : a Techno-Superliner that could run from Japan to the U.S. in three days .
