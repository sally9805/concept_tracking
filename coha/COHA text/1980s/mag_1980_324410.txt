The TIME Board of Economists sees sluggish growth and stinging inflation <P> Ever since the nation first began slumping into recession last winter , economists have been warning that it would prove diabolically difficult for the U.S. to climb back to sustained growth without aggravating inflation . Last week , with the downturn already showing signs of beginning to bottom out , members of TIME 'S Board of Economists somberly concluded that this recovery would not bring any significant slacking of price hikes . Democrat Walter Heller from the University of Minnesota appeared to sum up the views of his colleagues on the board with a rhetorical question : " Recession , where is thy anti-inflationary sting ? " Instead of halting the runaway rise in consumer prices , the decline seems merely to have kept the inflationary pressure bottled up and ready to escape at the first sign of renewed economic vigor . <P> While inflation has fallen back from the 18.2% annual rate hit last winter , TIME 'S economists predicted that the rate of price increases would dip only to about 10% by the turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high base from which the economy will again begin growing . At best , the board predicted a 1981 year-end inflation rate of 9.4% . But any number of external shocks to the economy , such as big new oil-price jumps , a bad 1981 harvest or an excessively cold winter , could send prices leaping to far higher levels than that . The board 's liberals fretted over the lack of an effective program of wage and price restraints by the vote-conscious Carter Administration to keep the pressure contained still longer ; conservatives worried that the nation simply will not sit still for the three to five years of slow growth that may be necessary to halt inflation in any significant way . <P> Board members split sharply over the timing of the economy 's eventual return to good health . There was also disagreement regarding just how buoyant or fitful the recovery would be . Most members forecast that the economy would either continue to decline or stagnate until the end of the year-this is in sharp disagreement with Commerce Department Chief Economist Courtenay Slater , who two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August . A minority of TIME 'S economists anticipated that a modest drop would continue into early 1981 . <P> Some figures released last week suggest that the economy is beginning to slow its rate of descent , if not to bounce back altogether . After six months of steady decline , industrial production in August rose 0.5% from the July level , while August 's construction of new residential housing rose 12% over the previous month 's depressed levels . Overall , preliminary statistics showed , in fact , that the contraction of the economy as a whole halted between July and September , as compared with the sharp 9.6% decline that had been registered between April and June .
