THE months since the election of a conservative Republican gov ernment in Washington have been especially unsettling ones for New York City . The ratio of regis  --  tered Democrats to registered Repub  --  licans here is more than five to one , and over the years the city has become a symbol to many Americans else  --  where of the open  --  handed liberalism that the new Administra  --  tion believes it has a mandate to put out of business . After the elec  --  tion , Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said of his fellow New Yorkers ' prospects of being able to look to the federal government for financial help , as in the past , " Now the Gover  --  nor and the Mayor and all of us will have to live with the reality that noth  --  ing much is coming out of Washing  --  ton . " Not all New Yorkers spoke in melancholy tones about the Reagan victory . Some prominent local resi  --  dents suggested jubilantly that it had come not a moment too soon . At a big party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Review , William A. Rusher , the magazine 's publisher , declared that liberalism was " almost as discredited as it is possible for a political philosophy to be . " The neoconservative writer Midge Decter said a few weeks after the election , " Liberals got completely out of touch with what is moving people , with what concerns them . They just went on in their own self-righteous way , characterizing everybody who dis  --  agreed with them as a bigot or selfish ... so liberalism lost its mandate . " Miss Decter 's views were reported in a Times article on what the news  --  paper called " Reagan 's Brain Trust . " The same article described the Na  --  tional Review and Commentary , whose editor , Norman Podhoretz , is Miss Decter 's husband , as " Reagan " puhlications . Miss Decter 's judgment on liberalism 's failures was the Times " Quotation of the Day " ? selected in preference to a statement on the same page by another local resident , Vernon Jordan , the president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil rights were more on people 's minds than the budgetary cost of en ? forcing them , the chosen quotation might easily have been Jordan 's . There had been speculation that the Ku Klux Klan had something to do with his having been shot from am  --  bush in Fort Wayne , Indiana , in May , 1980 . " I do not really worry about the Klan that 's dressed up in white sheets and marching around , " said Jordan . " I really worry about the Klan mentality in this country " ? a men  --  tality that " is operat  --  ing in three-piece suits and nice dresses . " The interests of Midge Decter and Vernon Jordan are not always different , however . In the Carter era , and especially during last year 's Presiden  --  tial campaign , the White House reg  --  ularly played host to throngs of local citizens considered to be key figures in the effort to win for Carter what were usually referred to as this state 's " crucial forty-one electoral votes " ? votes that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made no difference in the outcome . During the months since the Inauguration , New York names on White House invitation lists have been rarities , the Reagans understand  --  ably preferring to get together with their friends from the Sun Belt . Jor  --  dan and the Podhoretzes were all pleased to be invited to the dinner for West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt on May 21st . ( Although Miss Decter was in Europe and could not attend , her husband was there . ) Jacqueline Trescott , a Washington Post reporter , pointed out that , in Jor  --  dan 's case , it was the first time that the Reagan White House had asked an American black to an important din  --  ner for a foreign dignitary  --  except as an entertainer . At the three previous Reagan dinners of this kind , the enter  --  tainment had been provided by the Dance Theatre of Harlem , the Metro  --  politan Opera singer Shirley Verrett , and pianist Bobby Short  --  black per  --  formers from New York . Soon after the election , Jordan had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the President-elect " the benefit of the doubt , " and not find fault until the Administration 's plans were fully formulated . After the initial steps toward the new federalism turned out to require deep cuts in social programs fur the poor , Jordan did criticize the President , but rather politely , for the most part . This response has served as an additional excuse for the more mili  --  tant blacks to denounce him as " the white man 's black man . " Among these militants is Herbert Daughtry , a Brook  --  lyn minister and a founder of what he calls the National Black United Front , which has been responsible for a number of local street demonstrations and may have loomed larger on televi  --  sion screens than it has in the eyes of many of this city 's black residents . Daughtry complains that Jordan , who lives on Fifth Avenue , across from Central Park , has become too remote from the interests and needs of poorer blacks , whom the National Urban League is supposed to help with the hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that it receives each year . " The Ur  --  ban League has always been un  --  apologetically a bridge between the two races , " Jordan told " 60 Minutes " recently , indicating that in his view black activism in the streets belongs to a past era , when more liberal-minded governments could be counted on to respond to it . Daughtry has also com  --  plained that Jordan has put himself in a position where he ca n't speak out against people who fund him . Jordan may indeed have concluded that , how  --  ever painful Reagan 's cuts in welfare and food-stamp allotments may be , his own organization 's government allot  --  ment has a better chance of surviving if he does n't yell too much at those in charge of parcelling out the money . ( On the local scene , New York City 's new budget did not go out of its way to include programs particularly favored by Daughtry or by other local black figures who keep calling Mayor Ed  --  ward Koch a racist demagogue , only to have Koch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the story of the bridging between the races much of the time under the present city administration . ) Jordan said of Reagan during his evening at the White House , " I 'm in opposition to his program , yeah . But that has noth  --  ing to do with my presence here to  --  night . The President and I have a very special bond . " He was referring to the fact that both men had survived attempted assassinations  --  a feat that , sadly , is one basis for a sense of broth  --  erhood in America today . In an issue of the National Review published just after the election , an editorial announced that that issue THE NEW YORKER would be the last " in which we shall indulge in levity , " adding , no doubt in levity , " We have a nation to run . " Among the guests at the magazine 's twenty-fifth birthday party , in Decem  --  ber , was New York 's new Senator , Al  --  fonse D'Amato , who , as the candidate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had beaten two liberals  --  the incumbent Senator Jacob Javits , on the Liberal Party line , and Elizabeth Holtzman , the Democratic candidate . Also at the party was Mayor Koch . With his present repu  --  tation for political conservatism , Koch was more at home in this company of Reaganites than some of his predeces  --  sors would have been  --  and , indeed , more at home than he himself would have been until just a few years back . When he was elected Mayor , in 1977 , ht was serving in Congress as a Demo  --  cratic Representative from Manhattan . Late that year , a conservative group called the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress labelled him , on the basis of his record , the most radical member of the House . During the three and a half years since , Koch has moved so far rightward that in his 1981 reelection cam  --  paign he has the back  --  ing not only of all five of the city 's Demo  --  cratic county chair  --  men but of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ferred to as " the Repub  --  licans ' Democrat . " He is expected to win both the Democratic prima  --  ry and the general elec  --  tion by an overwhelm  --  ing margin , and he is also given a strong chance of taking the Republican primary . The Brooklyn Repub  --  lican boss , George Clark , explained that he had voted to give the G.O.P. endorse  --  ment to Koch with " a heavy heart , " since John Esposito , who will run against Koch in the Republican primary , is a loyal mem  --  ber of the Party . Espo  --  sito , a State Assembly  --  man from Queens , is not a political power in Albany or anywhere else , but Queens County Republican leaders had declined to endorse Koch , rejecting the theory that the Party could n't come up with even one worthy opponent , and so somebody had to run . " Imagine a little guy like me with all these Goliaths  --  David Garth , Mayor Koch , " Esposito said recently , putting the name of Koch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely the creature of his adman . Koch will not have the Con  --  servative Party endorsement . That went to Esposito , although the Mayor held meetings with Conservative lead  --  ers in an effort to make a deal with them . Early last month , when Staten Island Councilwoman Mary Codd , a former schoolteacher and the mother of eight , announced her candidacy for Mayor on the Liberal Party ticket ( whose endorsement Koch did not seek ) , she said that Koch had " polar  --  ized " the races in the city . Although he was elected as a reformer , she said , he had " brought the bosses back to City Hall  --  and not only the Demo  --  cratic bosses but the Republican ones as well . " She added that the Mayor should be " screaming and yelling " at the Reagan budget cuts and that Koch " has become so conservative that I think the Conservative Party is un  --  grateful in not endorsing him . " THE response to the Presidential-election returns here was not nearly as precipitate as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waxworks , the figure of Jimmy Carter was hauled away to a store room in Wookey Hole , in Somerset , and replaced by one of Ronald Reagan only hours after the result was an nounced . Nor , despite the open jubila tion of local conservatives , was there a feeling among them that the symbols of a rejected regime must quickly be de stroyed , as was apparently the case in Washington . Several days after the Inauguration , people walking past the White House could hear the crash ing and splintering sounds of Amy Carter 's tree house being knocked down and carted off . ( New York once had its own political tree house , which Koch found in the garden of Gracie Mansion when he moved in . It had been built by Mayor John Lindsay fur his son , and was used also by the grand children of Abraham Beame , Koch 's immediate predeces sor . Koch , like many of the leading figures in his administration , is unmarried  --  a circum stance that , according to some of his critics , causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems of more encumbered New Yorkers . The mayoral tree house , a memento of active family life , was eventually re moved , but the deed was done unobtru sively  --  having been required , it was ex plained , for security reasons . ) Along with the troubling news that , as they were con stantly being told , their view of the re sponsibilities of gov ernment had been per manently discredited , some New Yorkers had the minor problem of adjusting to new names , or new people with old names , in the headlines . Before this year , the name Regan in a local headline usually meant State Comptroller Edward Regan , the only Republican holding statewide office in Albany . After Donald Regan , the head of Merrill Lynch &; Com  --  pany , became the new Secretary of the Treasury , a headline such as " REGAN DENOUNCES DEMOCRATIC BUDGET " would raise the question of which Regan and which budget and which Democrats  --  not to mention the problem that speed-readers might have in confusing both Regans with the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pres  --  idential race , disappeared from the newspapers without a trace . Headlined stories about someone called Anderson suddenly had to do with Warren An  --  derson , the Republican Majority Lead  --  er of the State Senate , who , along with Edward Regan , is thinking seriously of running next year against the in  --  cumbent Democratic Governor , Hugh Carey , and will therefore be trying to make headlines even more often . The name Esposito in a political story al  --  ways used to mean Meade Esposito , the Democratic boss of Brooklyn . Now it often refers to Koch 's rival in the Republican mayoral primary . THE Brooklyn boss who made most of the news after the elec  --  tion was not Meade Esposito but George Clark , the Republican county chairman . Clark , a forty-year-old real-estate broker , had been the most outspoken local backer of Reagan since the mid-nineteen-seventies , when the state Republican Party was usually de  --  scribed as the wholly owned subsidiary of Nelson Rockefeller . The day after the Presidential returns came in , Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too much going to move or shake in this state that does n't go through rne . " Nevei.theless , boosting Clark up the political ladder took some doing , since the job he knew he de  --  served  --  Republican state chairman  --  was already occupied by Bernard Kil  --  bourn , a dentist from Oneida Coun  --  ty . Though Kilbourn had not been a strong Reagan supporter until Reagan 's nomination was virtually a sure thing , it would not do to affront him , because he was an upstater , and it is in the upstate counties and in the suburbs that most New York Repub  --  licans live . After months of maneuver  --  ing , the Reagan Administration found a post for Kilbourn as regional admin  --  istrator of the Department of Health and Human Services , which seemed to be a more appropriate assignment than JULY G , 1981 its placement of another dentist , James Edwards , as head of the Department of Energy . On June 4th , some weeks after Clark had become the Republicans ' first state chairman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of the five local Republican bosses invited Koch to run in their primary  --  a formality that is required by state law when the ap  --  plicant is a member of another party . They reasoned that they had no hope of beating the very popular Mayor and that if he won without the Repub  --  licans ' being in some way accessories before the fact they would continue to he shut out of City Hall patronage , as they have been since 1971 , when Lindsay , the last Republican Mayor , converted to the Democratic Party . Clark explained at the meeting that Koch had promised the Republicans " equal access " to City Hall  --  a fancy term for cutting them in on the pat  --  ronage . As sometimes happens , New York politics were way out of sync with the national scene . While , ac  --  cording to Republican polls , the switching over of Democrats was fast turning the Republicans into Amer  --  ica 's majority party , and in Washing  --  ton Republicans were eating Demo  --  crats for breakfast , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even to put up a fight against the Democratic incumbent , in the hope of a few kind favors . As Koch surely understood , his ac  --  ceptability for the Republican nomina  --  tion was based in part on the fact that in most of his public comments on the Reagan budget cuts , and in his testi  --  mony on the subject before various congressional committees , he had spo  --  ken in uncharacteristically well-modu  --  lated tones and had not called the Republicans ' and the nation 's leader any bad names . Other urban leaders  --  headed by Richard Hatcher , of Gary , Indiana , as president of the United States Conference of Mayors  --  might charge Reagan with trying to destroy America 's older cities . Koch did not chime in , hoping  --  fairly enough  --  that although other older cities in the Northeast and the Midwest might be severely punished under the Reagan economic-recovery program , the Ad  --  ministration might find some way to ease matters for New York and its relatively accommodating Mayor . In Koch 's testimony before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the problems that changes in Social Security laws might cause for the city 's elderly . " We have a million senior citizens in New York , " the Mayor told the House members , but he added quickly that this was not an exact count : " We have a million of everything in New York . " The local boast that this city has more of everything has not held up in the case of this year 's mayoral candidates . Over in New Jersey , a total of twenty-one contenders fought it out for the Democratic and Republican nomina  --  tions for Governor this year . Out in California , Tom Bradley , the first black Mayor of Los Angeles , was reelected over a field of eighteen op  --  ponents . ( The reelection of Bradley in a city that has a smaller percentage of blacks than New York  --  eighteen per cent versus twenty-five per cent  --  points up the comparative powerless  --  ness of the black community here . No black holds a citywide elective office  --  or ever has held one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timate , which votes on most sig  --  nificant city legislation . Only one black candidate is even on the ballot for a Board of Estimate seat this year : City Clerk David Dinkins , who is running for the Democratic nomina  --  tion for Manhattan Borough Presi  --  dent . Although this seat was held by blacks from 1954 through 1977 , the betting is against a Dinkins vic  --  tory . ) Previous mayoral races here have typically been crowded affairs ; Hugh Carey , surveying the 1973 cam  --  paign scene , said it was like " the run  --  nin4. of the bulls at Pamplona . " In 197/ , there were seven contenders in the Democratic primary . In early February of this year , when no candi  --  date of any party had yet emerged to challenge Koch , Theodore Kheel , a prominent local labor lawyer , an  --  nounced the formation of what he called the Coalition for a Mayoral Choice  --  a group that included two of Koch 's former Deputy Mayors whom he has publicly broken with . As the weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade anyone it approached to take on the Mayor . Kheel then an  --  nounced that its real purpose had been not to find a candidate but to make sure that the press and the electronic media adequately covered the campaign issues  --  issues that , as the coalition leaders then described them , turned out to be , collectively , the alleged in  --  adequacies and depredations of Koch . Late in April , there was a small flurry of action on the mayoral front . On April 21st , Bernard Rome , a wealthy local businessman , announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination . Rome had been treasurer of Koch 's 1977 campaign and had served as a member of the Koch administra  --  tion For over a year , but the two men had then had a bitter falling-out . When reporters suggested to Rome that he did n't have the remotest chance of being elected Mayor , he pointed our that that was just what people were saying about Ed Koch in early 1977 . Rome described Koch as a man who " eighteen hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bons " ? knowing that Koch in his 1977 campaign had vowed he would not be " a ribbon-cutting Mayor , " and so would be especially cross at this de  --  scription of his mayoral performance . Concerning New York 's still immense long-range problems , Koch , said Rome , had " no vision of the future . " ( In fact , the smiles on the faces in the crowds as the Mayor careers around town from one unimportant event to another , ever ready to strike a comic pose or loose an amusing quip , suggest that few New Yorkers  --  outside black communities , at any rate  --  have any quarrel with his decision about how to spend his time . In this city right now , vision may be what closes on Saturday night . ) On the day after Rome entered the Republican race , Jim Smith an  --  nounced his candidacy for the Demo  --  cratic nomination . Smith , a young printer with no political backing or experience , mentioned the adage that two men and a printing press could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his friends he intended to overturn Ed Koch . He pointed out what he saw as City Hall actions that might constitute conflicts of interest and used his printing company to pub  --  lish a list of Koch contributors  --  a list that was useful to some Koch critics who did not otherwise take Smith se  --  riously . After Smith noted that the May-or had illegally accepted thirteen thousand three hundred dollars from several local police unions , Koch re  --  turned the money . According to one theory , the young printer 's best chance of winning votes for himself would be to mobilize his fellow dues payers in the international Jim Smith Society  --  which has a thousand ninety-five members , including five women  --  and send them around town gathering money and petition signatures . Also late in April , Hal Koppersmith , a former teacher and another can didate who was not taken serious  --  ly  --  entered the Democratic race . Kop  --  persmith , who refers to Koch as " The Mayatollah of Graceless Mansion , " did not mind being called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sible person in the room , " he said . Finally , on May 14th , Brooklyn As  --  semblyman Frank Barbaro , a former longshoreman , became a candidate  --  the first Democrat believed to be capa  --  ble of gathering the ten thousand valid signatures of registered Democrats which are required to put a candidate on the primary ballot . Like John Esposito , Koch 's opponent in the Republican primary , Barbaro is not a figure of any great power in the State Assembly , which he , too , is eager to depart from in order to take over City Hall . Barbaro 's liberal credentials are in good order , however , and he has received the endorsement of the local Americans for Democratic Action and of the New Democratic Coalition  --  endorsements that Koch sought and won in the past but has since said that a candidate is better off without . After the Village Voice described Barbaro as the only " credible " candidate against Koch , Koppersmith , making the rounds of the local clubhouses , began introducing himself as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koch received the formal support of four of the five Republican county chairmen , Rome withdrew from the race , charging that the Mayor had bought the Republican nomination with promises of patronage , including judgeships . No matter what happens in the September primaries , the Mayor will face at least two opponents in the November election : Mary Codd , the Liberal , and Esposito , running as a Conservative . Koch frequently points to the fact that he will have an oppo  --  nent ( Barbaro ) in the Democratic primary as well as Esposito in the Republican primary , and adds that it is therefore unfair to say that in America 's largest city there is , practi  --  cally speaking , no mayoral election this year . SINCE , as of now , there is no ques  --  tion about who will he Mayor of the city for the next four years , the only really interesting question about the election is why Koch was so bent on having the Republican nomination when he could easily win without it . In the mayoral race four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodman , took less than five per cent of the vote . This spring , when it looked as if the local G.O.P. chairmen were not going to allow Koch to run in their primary , he dismissed the value of the en THE NEW YORKER dorsement , saying , " You call five per cent of the vote a major party ? " Among the reasons he has given for wanting the nomination is that it will be easier for him to govern the city if he has the backing of both major parties  --  not a claim that appeals to believers in the democratic process . As Mayor , Koch has liked to call himself  --  a hit presumptuously , it seemed at first ? " a six-foot Fio  --  rello LaGuardia . " Lately , he has often mentioned that LaGuardia ran on a Fusion ticket . However , the earlier Mayor , a Republican , never had the endorsement of both major parties ; his political career was , in fact , built on opposition to the local Democratic bosses with whom Koch is now locked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least as high as LaGuardia 's , Koch would go the Little Flower one better if he pulled off the historic feat of winning as the candidate of both major parties . In the case of the Republican primary , disappointment  --  not to mention fleet  --  ing political embarrassment  --  is a bare possibility . Of the city 's three hundred and sixty thousand registered Repub  --  licans , more than a third live in Espo  --  sito 's home territory of Queens . " I went over the Rubicon .... The train 's moving , " Esposito has said . " I , along with my Queens Republican colleagues , are marching on to City Hall . " However , Koch is believed to be especially popular among Queens voters , and he himself has pointed out that he is very popular among Esposi  --  to 's ( and Barbaro 's ) fellow Italian-Americans . In any event , Italian-Amer  --  icans often stay home on Primary Day . Last winter , when Esposito was dis  --  cussing a race for Mayor , he said , " The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that I 'm not Jewish does n't help me " ? a reference to the local ethnic group that votes heavily both in primaries and in general elec  --  tions . Since Republican primaries are rare events in New York and the turn  --  outs small , the results are considered especially hard to predict . In the 1969 mayoral primary , Republicans here rejected Lindsay , the incumbent Re  --  publican Mayor , in favor of a little-known state legislator , State Senator John Marchi , of Staten Island . ( Lind  --  say went on to win the election with  --  out the support of either major par  --  ty  --  a greater feat , perhaps , than win  --  ning on both major-party lines , but one that Koch will probably not try to emulate . ) Last month , William Sabre , in his column in the Times , roundly scolded New York Republicans for en  --  dorsing Koch in this year 's primary . " Every government at every level cries out for opposition to protect it from the arrogance of power and the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being implicated in a " coronation , " a " sellout , " and a " for  --  feiture , " he said , " I hope Republicans ? even those who would vote for Mayor Koch in a general elec  --  tion  --  vote for Mr. Esposito , whoever he is . " The reason the Mayor has most often cited in recent weeks for wanting the Republican ballot line is that when the city needs help the nomination will allow him to go to Majority Leader Anderson in Albany and to the Republican Senators in Washington and to " my friend Presi  --  dent Reagan " and point out that he comes to them as someone elected , like them , on the Republican ticket . However the Albany Republicans re  --  spond to this pitch , the reaction of Koch 's fellow-Democrat Hugh Carey , who will occupy the Executive Man  --  sion for eighteen months more and might even he reelected , could be wintry . One of the deals the Mayor made with the state Republicans in re  --  turn for the nomination was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **32;6449;TOOLONG  --  dollar debt left over from their losing effort to oust Carey in 1978 . Koch duti  --  fully appeared at a June 15th Repub  --  lican fund-raiser here at which he was endorsed for reelection by Richard Nixon , the most important guest . Clark has pointed out that paying off the Party debt , with Koch 's help , will allow the Republicans to get an early start on their effort to throw Carey out of office next year . Koch could also face problems in trying to cash in his Republican I.O.U.s in Washington . Any favored treatment for New York will have to make its way through Congress or through administrative tiers now dense with delegates from the Sun Belt , many of whom believe that Washington has already done New York too many favors . Every day or so , the Mayor mentions in a speech that since he took office the hostile old attitude toward New York in the House and the Senate has given way to admiration , and that now members of Congress wear " I Love New York " buttons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in this instance he may have got carried away . It is safe to say that many members of Congress still do not love New York . Last September , the House approved a plan that called For the federal government to take major re  --  sponsibility for a two-hundred-and  --  **26;6483;TOOLONG program to clean out a storage tank in West Val  --  ley , New York , containing over half a million gallons of highly radioactive nuclear wastes , which posed a grave danger to surrounding communities . The chief sponsor , Representative Stanley Lundine , of Jamestown , New York , said later that if somebody had asked for a roll call , putting House members on the record , he would have had to withdraw the bill . Not only is a vote for legislation that helps New York politically hazardous , he ex  --  plained , but in many districts around the country opposition to such a bill is treated as a political credit . A vote that will benefit New York City is consid  --  ered even more fraught with peril than one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Addabbo was able to steer through the House a bill that would require Pen  --  tagon officials to seek contract bids in areas where unemployment was above the national average  --  a measure that would he a boon to this city , where both costs and unemployment rates are high . Asked how he had got it through the House , Addabbo said , " We made sure no New Yorkers spoke for it except upstaters . " On cue , Senator Moynihan will intone the names of eight Senators who voted for federal loan guarantees for this city in 1978 , had that fact thrown up to them during the 1980 campaign , and lost their seats in November . And last month the Senate passed a bill that had an amendment attached to it which was co-sponsored by New York 's new conservative Republican Senator , D'Amato . The amendment provided that cities having forins of rent control must not put new units under rent control and must decontrol newly vacated units or lose certain federal housing funds . The vote was sixty-five to twenty-four . When Moynihan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it had passed by such a large margin , he said , " It 's an anti-New York City provision . Those things are never unpopular here . " ? ANDY LOGAN
