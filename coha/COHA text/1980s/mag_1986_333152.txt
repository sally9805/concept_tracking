Controversy sticks as closely to Libya 's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi as the bodyguards who follow him everywhere . In the past it has stalked his political and military moves ; now it is tracking him into the desert , where hydrology rather than revolutionary politics has captured his interest . In a scheme , large even by colonel 's standards , Libya is gearing up to mine water from beneath the Sahara Desert and pipe it hundreds of miles to the Mediterranean littoral , where there is an increasingly serious water shortage . The program is not only hugely expensive but also controversial . Says Brian Smith of the Institute of Hydrology in Wallingford , England : " The sociological and environmental risks in this undertaking are enormous . " <P> The cost of the project 's first phase alone is $3.6 billion , nearly as expensive as the Channel tunnel that will link Britain with Continental Europe . By the time the water pipeline is finished , around the turn of the century , says Dokali Megharief , head of the finance division of the project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . " <P> Eventually , more than 200 million cu . ft. of water a day will gush through the 13-ft. - wide pipes , as much as is carried by a major river . Put another way , the Libyans will be pumping more than twice as much water a day as the present volume of OPEC 's daily oil production . Some 2,500 miles of pipeline will stretch from the desert to the coast . The branches serving Tripoli alone will be more than 1,200 miles long , a distance roughly equal to that between Switzerland and Scotland . <P> The scheme can not be dismissed as just a pipe dream . Last month Gaddafi opened a plant at Brega , south of Benghazi , where some of the 73-ton pipeline sections will be made . Price Bros. of Dayton , a company that is prevented by U.S. restrictions from operating in Libya , provided most of the technology to build the plant . The main contractor , the Dong-Ah Construction Co. of South Korea , is bringing in 8,000 workers to make and lay the pipes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. exports to Libya or by President Reagan 's January Executive Order that forced hundreds of Americans to leave the country . " We are having no problem replacing American technicians , " says Megharief . <P> A more serious threat to the project may be the global slump in oil prices . Libya 's oil revenue is expected to total $5 billion this year , down from $22.6 billion in 1980 . Gaddafi is forging ahead anyway , paying his bills on time and urging Libyans to make greater and greater sacrifices . " A people that eats imported food can not be free , " he says , as store shelves become increasingly bare because of import reductions ordered to help pay for the project . Special income and sales taxes have been levied on Libyans . <P> Some 270 wells are being sunk in the Tazerbo and Sarir areas , more than 300 miles south of Benghazi . Plans call for additional wells to be drilled south of Tripoli and for more then half of Libya 's 1,100-mile coastline to be linked by the pipeline . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . <P> The water will come from aquifers deep beneath the Sahara , formed 20,000 to 40,000 years ago , when North Africa had a considerably higher rainfall . These vast subterranean water reservoirs were discovered in the 1960s by U.S. geologists searching for oil .
