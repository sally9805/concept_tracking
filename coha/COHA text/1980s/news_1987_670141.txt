All for one and one for all . That theme has traditionally determined how many executives receive incentive rewards . When the whole company does well , the executive does well ; when the company flops , so does the incentive pay . But many companies are starting to break from that tradition . They are now tailoring incentive plans to the performance of an executive ' s division or business unit over a three- to five-year period . The goal is to motivate executives and to reward them more fairly when their unit performs well  --  regardless of corporate results . The plans usually follow a company ' s move to decentralize and diversify its business . For instance , at Westinghouse Electric Corp. , which has some 23 units ranging from broadcasting to nuclear power , " We can ' t have one ( incentive ) formula that applies to everyone because each business is different , " says Edwin F. Goff , the company ' s director of compensation management . " Some are in tough growth markets , and others are in a stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company to drop long-term stock-option incentives based on corporate results in favor of long-term divisional targets for about 200 executives . " Companies seem to be putting an increasing amount of attention on units as separate profit centers , " says Charles Peck , compensation specialist for the Conference Board . " It makes sense then to make compensation reflect the unit rather than the corporation as a whole . " Indeed , when companies have many divisions or subsidiaries , linking incentive pay to corporate results is " like offering an executive an incentive based on the growth in the gross national product , " contends Mark R. Hurwich , a principal at Towers , Perrin , Forster &; Crosby , a consulting firm . Such a policy , he explains , is largely irrelevant to the executive and can even hinder recruiting efforts . But divisional incentives clearly aren ' t for every company , compensation experts say . " In a corporation where top management wants to be the final decision-maker , it wouldn ' t work very well , " says Mr. Goff of Westinghouse . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel and accounting problems ; divisional plans can be a nightmare to begin and implement ; executives are often reluctant to part with a relatively secure pot of corporatewide incentive pay for the unknown of divisional incentives ; and division heads could end up making more than their boss or the chief executive officer . Moreover , setting the goals for each executive is not only highly complex , but usually rife with internal politics and horse-trading . In theory , attaining the goals for various units should be similar in difficulty , but that ' s not alway the case . " The problem is , who determines what ' s equal difficulty ? " says Steven E. Gross , compensation consultant for Hay Management Consultants of Philadelphia . The answer is senior executives , he says , adding , however , that " politics " usually holdsway . Divisional incentives also aren ' t considered appropriate for companies that frequently transfer managers among units because the person ' s incentive pay could change drastically depending on the unit ' s goals . And some managers may resist a transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary is high and bonus predictable , to a troubled or start-up unit where incentive pay is more chancy . Finally , some compensation specialists question whether divorcing a division head ' s pay from overall corporate goals is a sound idea . " The question is , do you want people running around with six-shooters competing with one another , or do you want a team-based management that supports one another ? " says John Hillens , director of corporate compensation for Honeywell Inc . Du Pont Co. , for instance , has mostly rejected divisional incentives as contradictory to its " heritage of all for one , one for all , " says C. William Lee , director of compensation and benefits . " What are you trying to achieve ? " he asks . " Are you creating a bunch of individual entrepreneurs or do you retain the one-for-all concept , which is very valuable ? " One solution may be to reward executives based on a combination of corporate and division performance . Last year , for instance , about 70 division managers at Honeywell were awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the corporation . Managers receive stock by meeting certain return-on-investment goals for their units over a three-year period . Says Honeywell ' s Mr. Hillens : " We ' re sending two messages : One is you are a key player and you are responsible for total corporate results . But we also want you to be concerned about improving your own operating units . " Honeywell previously tied long-term incentive pay to the company ' s ability to reach certain return-on-investment goals . But Mr. Hillens says : " If you want incentive pay to change behavior , a manager has got to believe he has some control over what ' s being measured . If all the incentive pay goes into a corporatewide pot , it ' s saying , ' If you do well and others do poorly , well , we ' re sorry . ' That ' s not an incentive . " The plan also reflects Honeywell ' s diverse and decentralized structure ; its units sell everything from computers to alarm systems , and decision-making is pushed down to the various units . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies to tailor its annual , or short-term , incentive pay to the units ' particular performance . In that case , 20% of a manager ' s annual incentive pay is based on corporate results and the rest on the performance of his or her unit . Some companies have tried to refine such policies even further , using different measurements to correspond to the unit ' s strategy . The idea is that executives of a new , risky unit should be judged on , say , building market share , while executives of a stable , mature unit should be judged on generating cash or cutting costs . Premark International Inc. , based in Northbrook , Ill. , took this approach with its four business units , each with different strategic goals , says Wallace Nichols , director of compensation . Tupperware , the food-storage unit , for example , is trying to increase its net income ; thus , Tupperware executives ' long-term incentive is tied slightly more to meeting certain income goals over a three-year period , Mr. Nichols says . Executives of Premark ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are rewarded more heavily for improving that unit ' s return on investment . William Jackson , chairman of Tupperware International , says such differences are appropriate . " If Tupperware has a problem of year-to-year profit growth , " he says , " then corporate management is nuts to let the guys get a free ride " by basing incentive pay on an easily achieved unit target . Mr. Jackson also says that basing the incentives on long-term results might deter managers from artificially pumping up annual results . " Tupperware could reduce advertising and promotional activities and you can look good in profits that year . Then , the franchise starts to go to hell , " he says . " If you ' re shooting for an award after three years , there ' s less tendency to do things short term . " Another advantage , Mr. Jackson says , is in recruiting risk-takers . " I find you generally can ' t give enough salary , but incentive plans permit us to attract people . " Tupperware ' s potential for a strong rebound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that wouldn ' t happen if incentive pay was tied to corporate results . " It ' s not right that Tupperware ( executives ) get penalized because Hobart fell down or Kraft had a soft year , " he says . ( Premark was formed last year in a spinoff from Dart &; Kraft Inc . ) From the corporate view , says Premark ' s Mr. Nichols , the plan " ties our compensation in with the business unit strategy and helps focus the executive on what ' s important for that unit . " Under the plan , he says , some executives have gotten no incentive pay while others have doubled their base salary.  --  - Percentage of Companies Paying Bonuses ( By industry group ) Table Durable goods manufacturing . . 51. 2% Non-durable goods . . . . . . . . . . . . 56. 1% Energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37. 9% Wholesale and retail trade. . . . 36. 4% Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . 22. 2% Transportation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43. 7% Construction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40. 7% Financial-services companies . 26. 8% Services . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44. 4% Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46. 8% Billion-dollar companies . . . . . 66. 6% Source : ECS/Wyatt Co. <>  --  - Components of Executive Compensation ( For chief executives of $1 billion to $2 billion companies . ) Table 1986 Salary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46% Long-term incentive . . . . . . . 28% Annual bonus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26% 1975 Salary . . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . . 60% Long-term incentive . . . . . . . 15% Annual bonus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25% Source : Sibson &; Co. <>  --  - Avergae Bonus by Position ( As percentage of salary for all industries ) Table Chief executive officer 45. 5% Chief operating officer 43. 6% Executive vice president 31. 1% Administrative vice president 32. 6% Top marketing , sales executive 27. 2% Top mfg. /prod. /oper. executive 29. 3% Top financial executive 34. 5% All other positions 28. 4%  --  - <> Average Bonus by Industry Group ( As percentage of salary for senior executives ) Table Durable goods manufacturing 33. 1% Non-durable goods 32. 1% Energy 43. 3% Wholesale and retail trade 33. 9% Public utilities 21. 8% Transportation 29. 1% Construction 27. 8% Financial-services companies 27. 9% Services 28. 9% Other 30. 4% Billion-dollar companies 40. 3% Source : ECS/Wyatt Co . <> Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal                  @ @ @
