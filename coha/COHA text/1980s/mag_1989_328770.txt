She has always liked the sound of her own voice , and used to warble to the crowds at her husband 's election rallies . Now former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos is hoping to reach a less captive audience in the U.S. with the release this week of a cassette of twelve " songs of love and friendship " that she recorded with Philippine pop singer Imelda Papin . Titled Imelda Papin Featuring Imelda Romualdez Marcos , the cassette will be produced in a limited edition of 5,000 , and includes five solos by Mrs. Marcos . Papin says the songs , including Feelings and I Just Called to Say I Love You , are all beloved tunes of the ailing Ferdinand Marcos .
