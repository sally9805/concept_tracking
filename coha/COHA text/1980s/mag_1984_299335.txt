THE DEATH MERCHANT by Joseph C. Goulden <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 455 pages ; $17.95 <P> In 1982 , when former CIA Agent Edwin Wilson was awaiting trial for having masterminded the biggest arms-smuggling operation in U.S. history , he spent his time plotting the assassination of two federal prosecutors and six potential witnesses against him . For that crime Wilson was sentenced to 25 years in prison . In addition , he received 32 years for smuggling explosives and weapons to Libya . <P> Because of a technicality , Wilson was spared prosecution for the murder contract he had put out on his hated former wife , the mother of his two children . " Take her off somewhere and break her neck , " he told a prospective hitman , who went to the authorities . Wilson specified that he wanted Barbara Wilson 's corpse stripped of her jewelry , especially her big diamond ring . " It 's my good-luck piece , " he said . " I want it back .

Yet Joseph Goulden 's riveting account of the Wilson case makes such villainy seem chillingly plausible . Goulden , a respected investigative reporter , who has written twelve books of non-fiction ( The Superlawyers , Korea ) , suggests that Wilson 's character was formed by a harsh , cold father and a childhood spent on the rough edge of poverty in Idaho . Young Wilson showed a flair for manipulating other people , without undue regard for affection or morality ; this trait aided his work as an operative for the CIA and the Office of Naval Intelligence . By the mid-1970s , Wilson had achieved a shadowy prominence in Washington . As Goulden tells it , scores of Government officials , Congressmen and Pentagon officers were mesmerized by the not-so-secret agent 's lethal charm . <P> More alluring still was the promise of big deals and easy money that Wilson laid before dazzled guests at his 3,000-acre estate in the Virginia hunt country .

But it fed already widespread suspicions about U.S. intelligence practices and influenced the only acquittal that the arms dealer received after his empire went to smash . At his 1983 trial for attempting to hire three Cubans to assassinate a Libyan dissident in 1976 , one of the Cubans testified that he had indeed worked with Wilson in both the CIA and Naval Intelligence , albeit before Wilson had put out the murder contract . The reaction of a member of the predominantly black jury appeared to reflect public opinion at the time : " This seemed like some kind of spook deal when all dudes were lying on one another .
