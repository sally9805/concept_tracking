The withdrawal thus made Merrill Lynch Capital Partners , an investment arm of the big Wall Street house , the winner of the auction battle to acquire Borg-Warner , with a bid of $4. 23 billion two weeks ago. // Merrill Lynch ' s gain will also mean an enormous profit for GAF , a chemicals and building materials producer . Samuel J. Heyman , GAF ' s chairman , said his company would tender its Borg-Warner stock to Merrill Lynch and expected to show a pretax profit of more than $190 million. // // GAF Stock Buyback // GAF , which is based in Wayne , N.J. , announced simultaneously that its directors had authorized the purchase " from time to time " of as many as three million of its own shares , representing 8. 4 percent of its stock .

Senior executives of Borg-Warner were not expected to be investors initially , to avoid appearances of conflict of interest. // But GAF , which owns 19. 9 percent of Borg-Warner ' s stock and had made an all-cash offer of $48 a share , refused to withdraw immediately , raising hopes among stockholders that it might outbid Merrill Lynch. // Mr. Heyman , the former real estate developer who took over a financially troubled GAF in late 1983 and made it highly profitable , voiced disappointment at losing Borg-Warner . He viewed Borg-Warner ' s chemicals and plastics and GAF ' s specialty chemicals as " an excellent strategic fit " but said he could not justify what it would cost to outbid Merrill Lynch. // GAF also made a substantial profit on an earlier battle to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the takeover attempt in January 1986 but estimated its after-tax gain on its Union Carbide stock at $81 million . <> <> Attention on CBI Industries // Mr. Heyman said in an interview that he was still interested in expanding in chemicals , both internally and through acquisitions , but had " no specific targets in mind at the present time .
