THE GLITTER DOME by Joseph Wambaugh ; Morrow ; 299 pages ; $12.95 <P> Through five bestsellers , four films and two television series , Joseph Wambaugh 's characters have altered America 's view of its police . His Los Angeles officers are neither the lone-eagle heroes of reactionary fantasy nor fascist mercenaries cracking the skulls of the innocent . They are , instead , ordinary , besieged working men and women whose lives are presented with war-zone humor , lively plots and a refreshing lack of night-school sociology . In Wambaugh 's newest novel , those servants have grown a little less civil , and the quiet desperation of their lives has moved up several decibel levels . <P> In The Glitter Dome , the Hollywood detective division is more M*A*S*H unit than police station . Its inmates have one common ambition : survival-from perpetrators and pistols , alcoholism and insanity , suicide and divorce . These are choirboys at the end of the song . Their angst is echoed on the mean streets just below the topiary of Beverly Hills : heroin , child abuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studio Boss Nigel St. Claire is found with two .38-cal. bullets in his face , Al Mackey and Marty Welborn , a couple of Wambaugh 's best creations , are called in . <P> The twice-divorced Mackey " chews on his gun sights " in whisky-fired night sweats . Welborn ( one separation , compulsively neat ) hangs upside down on an aluminum bar for his bad back , tormented by the loss of his altar-boy faith . But the blue knights possess a unique talent : as Captain Woofer , their boss , puts it , " Nobody 's asking anybody to solve anything . I just like the way you two seem to clear every homicide . " Seem is the operative word : they once convinced the department that a local cocaine dealer had committed suicide with a hatchet . As for nabbing real and careful murderers , these weary , inventive sleuths know better : that happens on prime time . TV plotting , however , is never far away . <P> " As all policemen learn , " Wambaugh writes , " life imitates not art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vivid examples . His heroes carom off two patrolmen dubbed " street monsters " for their appetite for violence ; a Marine posing for gay sculptors ; the Ferret and the Weasel , a pair of frenzied narcs ; a Vietnamese assassin ; Tuna Can Tommy , a flasher with a phenomenal physique ; and a massage-parlor hostess called Jackin Jill .
