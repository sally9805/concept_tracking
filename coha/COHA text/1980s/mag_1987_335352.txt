Want " a cash reserve for anything you want , whenever you want it , " as New York 's Dime Savings Bank promises ? Or " a real bargain , " courtesy of California First ? Those are the kinds of advertising claims that are wafting these days around banking 's hottest product , the home-equity loan . A boomlet of sorts is under way as customers respond with enthusiasm to this form of consumer debt , while lenders vie frantically for customers and market share . But amid the rush , cautionary voices are warning about the dangers of the popular loans , and the misleading nature of some of the hype . The major worry : that some unwary consumers may be undercutting an integral factor in most American savings portfolios , the family home . <P> Home-equity loans are doing a land-office business , expected to double to $70 billion this year ( see chart ) . They are thus gaining rapidly on another method of borrowing against the American home , standard second mortgages , which are likely to be worth $130 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short-term , fixed-payment plan for a set amount , based on the value of a home that remains after deducting its first mortgage . But home-equity loans are different : they allow owners to put up their homes as collateral to open variable-rate , revolving-credit accounts good for up to 80% of the equity the homeowner has accrued . Because home-equity loans can be used to buy consumer items , including anything from stereos to luxury cars , their newfound allure comes from a loophole in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which phased out the deductibility of all interest payments except mortgage payments on principal and second homes . Home-equity borrowing currently offers markedly lower interest rates ( about 10% ) than an unsecured personal loan ( 14% ) or credit-card loans ( about 18% ) . <P> But along with those advantages come significant snags that many lenders neglect to advertise . The vast majority of home-equity loans are tied to fluctuations in the prime lending rate , now 8.25% , and can vary enormously in cost as that rate changes . If the prime were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 and 1981 , someone now paying 9.75% on a home-equity loan might suddenly have to pay 22.25% . Such a whopping increase is possible because many equity loans lack the so-called caps common to ordinary variable- rate mortgages , which limit interest-rate hikes to two percentage points or so a year . <P> In their zeal to book new business , some lenders gloss over the fact that failure to pay up can mean the loss of the borrower 's home . In a survey of 91 lenders around the country , two consumer groups , the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union , found a variety of other alleged abuses . Some lenders failed to disclose that low introductory , or " teaser , " interest rates would later be increased . Others did not publicize the fact that their loans required large lump sums as final payments . Last month New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner Angelo Aponte warned a dozen local banks that their ads " encourage frivolous spending at the risk of foreclosure.
