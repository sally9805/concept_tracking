txt Federated Department Stores Inc. and Children 's Place Inc. said they reached a tentative settlement with a Children 's Place shareholder that should allow the two retailers to complete their $45 million merger . At the same time the proposed settlement would substantially sweeten the pot for some Children 's Place shareholders , by allowing them to qualify for a more favorable taxation rate on their profit from the transaction . As reported . Federated and Children 's Place agreed last October to Federated 's purchase of Children 's Place at $30.50 a share . As part of the agreement , Federated exercised an option to buy 200,000 previously unissued shares , equal to about 12% of those outstanding , at $30.50 each . Federated is a Cincinnati-based operator of department and specialty stores . Children 's Place is a Pine Brook , N.J.-based specialty retailer that went public last April . ' Freeze Out ' But last month a Children 's Place shareholder filed a class-action suit in Wilimington , Del. , alleging that principal shareholders of Children 's Place conspired with Federated to " freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the merger price low and asserted that the principal holders would get a better return after taxes from the merger than public holders . David J. Steinberg Ltd. , which owns 200 shares and is the holding company of Mr. Steinberg , a Philadelphia lawyer , filed the suit in an attempt to block the merger . A Delaware judge ruled late last month that the merger could n't be completed until the court considered issues raised by Mr. Steinberg 's suit . Children 's Place holders approved the merger at a meeting last month . The main contention of Mr. Steinberg 's suit was that if the merger was allowed to be completed soon , as anticipated by the two companies , shareholders who bought into the company since its public offering last April 28 , would get short-term taxation treatment of their payout from the merger . The principal shareholders of Children 's Place all have held their shares for longer than 12 months , the suit said , qualifying them for the more favorable long-term capital gains taxation , in effect giving them a higher return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's Place said jointly that Mr. Steinberg 's allegations were " totally without merit " and that the companies intended to proceed " vigorously to defend against this lawsuit . " Federated said yesterday that because " we were eager " to complete the merger . it and Children 's Place agreed to most of Mr. Steinberg 's demands . The Delaware court must still approve the settlement . Specifically , Federated and Children 's Place agreed to make provisions for those Children 's Place shareholders who do n't want to accept payment immediately upon tendering their shares . Instead , these shares will be kept in escrow by Federated at least until June 1 . when some of the holders would become eligible for the more favorable long-term capital gains taxation rate . These holders then will receive the full price of $30.50 a share . The two companies also agreed to let any Children 's Place shareholder who wishes to change his vote on the merger do so . Federated said it agreed that the 200,000 shares of common stock it holds in Children 's Place will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders of Children 's Place . The two companies said full terms of the settlement will be disclosed in a supplement to Children 's Place 's proxy statement , which is expected to be mailed to its shareholders next week . Children 's Place stock was quoted yesterday in over-the-counter trading at 329.75 a share bid , up 12542 cents . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Federated closed up 50 cents at $37.625 a share . ' Super Deal ' An attorney representing Mr. Steinberg in the swt said his client " is certainly satisfied with the settlement , " adding that it meets Mr. Steinberg 's primary objective of getting equal tax status for all shareholders . Mr. Steinberg declined to be interviewed . While Mr. Steinberg complained in his suit about the $30.50-a-share offering price , analysts said Federated 's offer was probably more generous then could have been expected . " It is a super deal for the stockholders , " one said . " No one else would pay that much . " A Federated spokesman said the company still believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the best interest of all parties to settle this matter . " The spokesman said Federated is eager to proceed with plans it made for after the merger , including supporting Children 's Place 's " very ambitious growth program . " He declined to be more specific . Federated said it expects the merger will be completed next month , provided it gets the necessary approvals.
