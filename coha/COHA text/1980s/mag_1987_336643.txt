George Shultz 's visit to Moscow was supposed to pin down one achievement that could serve as a lifeline for Ronald Reagan 's foundering presidency : the long- awaited and much heralded visit of Mikhail Gorbachev to the U.S. But the Soviet leader was curiously circumspect as he posed with the Secretary of State last Friday in the ocher-colored St. Catherine Hall of the Kremlin 's Great Palace . " I think this will happen , " he replied , somewhat evasively , when reporters questioned him about the prospects for a summit . Asked whether he would like to see just Washington or the rest of the country , he again sounded a note of doubt . " I would like to see the country , the whole country , " he answered . " Whether I am able to is the question .
