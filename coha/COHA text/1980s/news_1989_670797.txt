In its 2-to-1 ruling , a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the Government had not shown criminal intent by Mr. Nofziger . And since the law under which he was convicted is ambiguous as to whether such intent is required for a guilty verdict , he must receive the benefit of the doubt , the decision said. // Mr. Nofziger was found guilty in February 1988 of illegally lobbying former colleagues on behalf of clients of a consulting firm that he created in 1982 when he left the Reagan White House , where he had been the political affairs director . The conviction was the first under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 , which sought in part to close a " revolving door " between government and private industry by forbidding high officials who leave the executive branch to lobby former colleagues until a year after departure. // // Buckley Writes Decision // The decision voiding the conviction was written by James Buckley , a former Republican Senator from New York who was appointed to the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams , another Reagan appointee . Judge Harry Edwards , appointed by President Jimmy Carter , dissented , saying Judges Buckley and Williams had strained to find an ambiguity in the law where none existed. // At a news conference this afternoon , the 65-year-old Mr. Nofziger noted that he had long protested his innocence and said he was " certainly pleased " by the decision . The independent counsel who prosecuted the case said , meanwhile , that he had not yet decided whether to appeal . <> <> Three-Count Conviction // The decision came 16 months after Mr. Nofziger had been convicted by a Federal jury here on three counts : // * Trying to influence Edwin Meese 3d , who was then White House counselor , by sending him a memorandum in April 1982 seeking support for an Army engine contract for the Wedtech Corporation. // * Sending a memorandum in August 1982 to James Jenkins , Mr. Meese ' s deputy , to enlist support for putting civilian sailors on Navy vessels , an idea pushed by the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association. // * Improperly lobbying two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of the Fairchild Republic Corporation , makers of the A-10 antitank aircraft. // Mr. Nofziger was sentenced to 90 days ' imprisonment and fines of $30 , 000 but remained free on his own recognizance pending the resolution of his appeal . <> <> The Letter of the Law // That appeal centered on the wording of a provision in the Ethics in Government Act , specifically whether the word " knowingly , " which clearly applies to the provision ' s first clause , is intended to apply to a later clause as well . The provision , dealing with former executive branch employees , says : // " Whoever , within one year after such employment has ceased , knowingly acts as agent or attorney for , or otherwise represents , anyone other than the U.S. in any formal or informal appearance before , or , with the intent to influence , makes any oral or written comunication on behalf of anyone other than the U.S. to ( 1 ) the agency in which he served , or any officer or employee thereof , ( 2 ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such agency has a direct and substantial interest " shall be guilty of a felony. // Mr. Nofziger ' s lawyers contended that the word " knowingly " applied not only to someone acting as an attorney or agent but also to someone , like Mr. Nofziger , who so much as communicated with Government employees whose agency had " a direct and substantial interest " in a given policy or project. // If the word does apply to the later clause , then the prosecutors must show criminal intent by such a defendant . But the prosecutors in Mr. Nofziger ' s case never sought to prove that he had known that his former colleagues had " a direct and substantial interest " in matters about which he was lobbying them. // " This is not an idle grammatical inquiry , " Judge Buckley said in the ruling today . " If Nofziger ' s interpretation is correct , no one may be convicted " unless it can be shown " that he had knowledge of each of the facts constituting the offense. " // Judge Buckley found the Ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Canons of stautory construction require that an ambiguous criminal statute be interpreted in the defendant ' s favor. " // " As we find no evidence that Congress intended to impose strict liability , " the ruling said , " we must be guided by the rule of lenity and the presumption of mens rea. " // " Mens rea " is Latin for " guilty mind , " and refers to a need to establish a defendant ' s criminal intent. // The finding of ambiguity was an echo of the consternation of Judge Thomas A. Flannery , who , while presiding over Mr. Nofziger ' s trial , declared at one point that " the big problem with this case is that we are dealing with a statute that is hardly a model of clarity . " <> <> Judge ' s Dissent // But in his dissent today Judge Edwards said that " the majority has labored mightily to find an ambiguity " where " there is no ambiguity to resolve , and consequently no basis for overturning Nofziger ' s conviction. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the clause concerning communication , the prosecution had to prove only Mr. Nofziger ' s " intent to influence , " not knowledge that what he was doing might be criminal. // " I can not understand my colleagues ' convoluted attempts " to uphold Mr. Nofziger ' s position , said Judge Edwards , who also criticized what he described as the majority ' s " willingness to ignore clear legislative history and engage in overt legislating . " <> <> Statement by McKay // The decision sent the case back to Federal District Court for disposition , although the independent prosecutor , James C. McKay , may now appeal to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court . In a statement issued here today , he said he would consider whether " to pursue further appellate review of this decision . " Mr. McKay had sought a narrow interpretation of the statute , one that did not require criminal intent for conviction. // At his news conference this afternoon , Mr. Nofziger said that he had spent $1. 5 million in legal fees and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family but also an emotional one. //
