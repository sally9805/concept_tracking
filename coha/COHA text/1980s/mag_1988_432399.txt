 | The hand that flashed the prefight V-for-victory sign over Mike Tyson 's head came sheathed in an AIDS-age rubber glove . The introduction of the champ 's wife by the traditional talking tuxedo in midring brought forth a chorus of boos . Boxing has come a long way from the days when men battled with their knuckles bared and the First Lady of the heavyweight division earned pity for her husband 's dangerous profession . Indeed , if the 91-second Fight of the Century taught us anything it was that this supposedly seasonless sport has begun experiencing a climate change . For the first time in memory , there are no bigmoney fights in the air . Last week 's dismantling of Michael Spinks already looks like something more than we imagined : an event that will rank , in the minds of boxing enthusiasts , with the birth of Jake LaMotta and the invention of valet parking . Except that this is a real downer . Tyson may retire , as he threatened to at the postfight press conference ? or he may fight the aggressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 39-year-old George Foreman . How is the average person going to tell the difference ? " Mike is not King Kong , " Bruno pointed out in Atlantic City last week . But the problem is that the landscape Tyson inhabits has been littered with Fay Wrays . All fight fans can do at this point is hunker down and wait for the champ to begin feeling the effects of age . The good news on that front is that there are already two lawyers , an estranged manager , a happy-haired promoter , a wife , a co-manager 's widow and a mother-in-law doing their best to speed the process . Ladies and gentlemen , let 's bring on the Distractions . A group we 've been hearing so much about . A couple of hours before fight time Tyson 's would-be manager Don King and his de facto trainer Kevin Rooney got into a highly symbolic shoving match for the last spot on an elevator at Trump Plaza ? one of several boardwalk hotels , incidentally , that Tyson 's wife , Robin Givens , had reportedly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the principals stepped into the ring , Bill Cayton , the champion 's manager , found himself served with a lawsuit filed by Tyson . In it , the champ contends that his contract cutting Cayton in for one-third of his earnings is fraudulent because , among other reasons , he was not informed , when the deal was struck last February , that Cayton 's partner , Jim Jacobs , was dying . ( The co-manager , a father figure to Tyson , succumbed to leukemia a month later . ) Cayton , upon receiving the papers at ringside , passed them to his lawyer , Thomas Puccio , who says , " I glanced down at the first few paragraphs and almost missed the fight . " A survivor 's euphoria : Puccio was seated next to Tom Brokaw , who was n't far from Jesse Jackson , Jack Nicholson , Warren Beatty , Stephen King , Paul Simon , George Steinbrenner ( most boos upon introduction ) and Natalie Cole ( biggest cheers ) ? all of whom were across the ring from a section that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foxx , Slappy White ) stand-up comics . Welcome to Hollywood Squared . Many of the celebrities wore press credentials that allowed them to attend the postfight gathering at which Spinks , bubbling with a survivor 's euphoria , could n't stop talking about a battle that no one else had seen . ( " I was n't scared . He did n't hit me that hard . " ) As the loser burbled on , fight-writers flipped their notebooks closed and filed out with eyes lowered . A day later , it would be just as hard to watch Puccio bring Jim Jacobs 's widow , @#  | Loraine , before the cameras so she could cry and say , " We 've treated him as a son . I just ca n't believe Mike would do this . " By " this " she presumably meant ask that the purse money not be distributed . " What we have here is a strange suit that reflects the confusion on the other side , " Puccio says . " I mean , Michael is ordering us to not pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suit filed on his behalf by attorney Michael Winston , is that his $22 million be held up until the matter of who manages his affairs is settled . Winston may have been referred to the champ by Tyson 's mother-inlaw , Ruth Roper , a woman who 's described by many as manipulative and publicityhungry . But the legal position Tyson has assumed has impressed at least one executive involved in the promotion as " showing reasonableness and restraint . " Certainly , except for a brief postfight moment when he described the press as " a bunch of assholes , " Tyson seemed cool and collected . On the afternoon of the fight he enthusiastically welcomed a visit from former three-time world champion Roberto Duran , an idol whom Tyson had never met . Duran dropped by to dispense some wisdom ( " Spinks will be scared , and you should keep pressing him . When he drops that left shoulder , you come with the uppercut " ) which turned out to be @# positively prescient . But the legendary Hands of Stone also had a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual source for such freebies and the backer of some of Duran 's bigger bouts , now refused his phone calls , the older fighter said . Tyson immediately arranged to buy a ringside seat , and according to assistant manager Steve Lott " he seemed truly happy to be able to help his boyhood hero . " The lesson of the promoter 's apparently short memory , though , could not have been lost on the young champion who recently received a loan from the same Don King to buy a Rolls-Royce . The legal sparring begins : Who will win the fight for the fighter ? Legal battles , unlike boxing matches , usually result in compromises . At the weekend , the lawyers for both sides were exploring the possibility of an out-of-court settlement that would in all likelihood involve compensation for Cayton and freedom for Tyson to renegotiate his management contract from a position of strength . The champion probably has no specific plan for the future , although , says Puccio , " It 's my feeling that neither side wants to do business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding someone to handle his financial affairs ; it 's that he makes his living in a sport that he has rendered unnecessary . " Oh , things are not totally bleak , " says Donald Trump , whose two hotel-casinos have helped make boxing a big business in Atlantic City . " There 's always Cesar whatever . " Yes , but the highly regarded Julio Cesar Chavez is a lightweight , a word which in America means the guy who does n't quite rate the corner office . History dictates that heavyweights must carry the manly art on their impressive shoulders . The world has one who now stands alone , shadowboxing on the edge of a long , dark night .
