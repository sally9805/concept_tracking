Aristocratic Cuban exiles puzzle over the unfamiliar foods given to them as charity by some Dallas Presbyterians . A Southwest farm worker becomes obsessed with breeding the perfect fighting cock . A Manhattan drug dealer demands that his son stay off drugs  --  or , if he must get high , that he do it in his father 's company , at home . A Chicano woman struggles to bring to justice the Texas police chief who murdered her common-law husband . <P> These emotionally vibrant , and frequently violent , images come from an emerging cadre of playwrights who are perhaps the most eagerly cultivated new voices in the American theater . Like blacks a generation ago , Hispanics have become the ethnic group of the moment , both off-Broadway and at many of the nation 's foremost regional theaters . From Manhattan 's Public Theater through the Milwaukee Repertory Theater to the Los Angeles Theater Center , they are using their new ascendancy to reach main stages and middle-class white audiences . <P> The new generation takes its inspiration from the pioneering Hispanic playwrights Maria Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Zoot Suit , I Do n't Have to Show You No Stinking Badges ) and the late Miguel Pinero ( Short Eyes ) . Four younger writers particularly stand out . They happen to reflect the major ethnic subdivisions within the Hispanic community  --  Cuban exile , Chicano , Puerto Rican and Latin American emigre  --  and to embrace literary styles ranging from political invective to lyrical recollection . What distinguishes them , however , is not such representative qualities but a memorable personal vision . <P> Perhaps the most gifted is Eduardo Machado , 35 , a Cuban expatriate who arrived in the U.S. at age eight , speaking no English , when his family fled Castro 's Cuba . Brought up in Los Angeles , he now divides his time between a house in suburban Pasadena , Calif. , and an apartment in Manhattan . A would-be actor , he began writing plays when a therapist suggested he compose an imaginary letter of forgiveness to his mother . Among his best works : The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa , an evocation of the complex caste system in Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bafflement and determination of a family uprooted by the Castro revolution and exiled in the U.S. " I was the first Hispanic playwright in America to write about upper- class people , " says Machado . As a result , he believes , " I do n't get performed much by Hispanic theaters . I find that odd  --  they still believe in the stereotype . " <P> At the other end of the political spectrum is Carlos Morton , 40 , a didactic , polemical , yet often fiercely funny Texan . Born in Chicago , Morton spoke only Spanish until age five , then adopted English . Frequently uprooted to such places as Panama and Ecuador because his father was a career military man , he now teaches at Laredo Junior College , a few blocks from the Mexican border .
