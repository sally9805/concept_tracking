 | " He tells me he will be king , " answers Abishag , " and asks me to be nice to him now . Will Adonijah be king , my lord ? " " You see ? " cries Bathsheba . " Would my Solomon do something like that ? " " Send in Solomon , " I decide . Bathsheba heaves a sigh . " You 'll never regret a minute you spend with my Solomon , " she exclaims . " He 's such a joy , my Solomon . A jewel . He 'll make you proud . " " Solomon , " I begin very tolerantly with the best intentions , endeavoring one more time to plumb the depths of this our son if ever I should be so blessed as to find any . After all , is Adonijah such an Einstein ? " You know  --  even you know ? " I falter and have to break off , wincing beneath the discomforting weight of his transfixed attention . As usual , he sits listening stolidly to me , his stylus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined toward me with a deference that is almost offensive , as though all my words ought immediately to be recorded on stone . " Solomon , " I resume even more patiently in a softer tone , after wetting my tongue with some water from a cruse , " even you know about Shimei the son of Gera  --  remember ? ? who cursed me grievously that day as I fled from Jerusalem to Mahanaim . But he came down to meet me in penitence when I returned to Jordan . And I swore to him by the Lord that I would not put him to death with the sword . Now mark me well . " Solomon nods once gravely to show he is marking me well and bends still closer with his rigid expression . I wish it were possible for me to recoil from him farther . His breath is repulsive , much too sweet , and I judge he is using some kind of obnoxious male cologne on his face and beneath his arms .

" " You swore that you would not put him to death , " he recites in a monotone , reading from his tablet . " But you did not swear that I would not put him to death . " He says this without a glimmer of levity brightening his lugubrious mien , and I begin to fear he does not get my meaning . " Solomon ? Abishag , my darling , let me have a little bit of that stuff you prepare that helps settle my stomach . " " Bicarbonate of soda ? " " No , the stronger stuff today .

" Solomon , my dearest son , " I say to him in a voice lowered to a level of seriousness almost sacrosanct , " let me give you now a precious secret about kingship , about how to rule well and be honored by your subjects , even by your enemies . You would like to be a king someday , would n't you ? Would you like to be a king ? " " I would like to be a king . " " Why would you like to be a king ? " " Peacocks and apes .

She thinks I 'd be happy as king . " " I 'm not happy as king , " I tell him . " Maybe if you had some peacocks and apes . " " How many ? " " Lots . " " Solomon , you do n't smile when you say that . You never smile . I do n't think I 've ever seen you smile . " " Maybe I 've never had anything to smile about . Maybe if I had some peacocks and apes .

Please hearken to me closely now . " My throat is dry again . " If ever you do become a king , and if you want to be honored as a king and deemed worthy as a king , and if ever you find yourself drinking date wine or pomegranate wine from one of the royal goblets in the company of others whose good opinion you wish to retain , always make certain that you drink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Inside the brim ?

" Are n't you going to ask me why ? " I prod . " Why ? " he responds obediently . This is about as much mental agility as I 've ever been able to whip up in him . " Because otherwise , " I inform him , feeling let down , " the wine will spill down the front of your neck , you goddamned fool ! Abishag ! Abishag ! Show him the door . The fucking door ! Show Shlomo the fucking door ! " " I 've seen the door . " " Get out , get out , you idiot , you dummy , get out , get out ! Abishag , give me some more of that shit for my stomach .

But Bathsheba would not , and tries to convince me that Solomon is the wisest man in the kingdom . " Next to you , of course , " she throws in with ritual politeness . " He writes down everything you say . " " And does n't understand a fucking word of it . And then goes about giving it out as his own . I know what he does . I 've got spies . " " Have dinner with him tonight , " she dictates to me . She has switched to a robe of aquamarine with a flouncing train that parts at the front and twirls about her ankles as she paces and swerves , and she has put on a pair of those skimpy bloomers she invented that she calls panties . Kneeling at my couch , she takes my hand . The warmth from her palms is agreeable . It is so seldom nowadays that she touches me . " Get to know him better . That would he nice . would n't it ? lust the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | wrong ? " She feels my shudder and lets go of my hand as though it were something reptilian . " And maybe me too . And maybe Nathan . And Benaiah also . " " No , no , no , no , not in a million years , " I tell her . " Not in a billion . I 'm not eating a meal with Solomon again in my whole life , and certainly not on one of its last days . He watches every mouthful I eat , and then makes sure to eat exactly as much . If he gives a person the right time , he always asks for it back . He never makes jokes . Do you ever see him laugh ? " " What 's there to laugh about ? " she answers with a shrug . " His dear father is full of days and soon will be dead . " I turn myself over on my side to confront her . " He still goes around cursing deaf people , does n't he ? " " That 's proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deaf people are unable to hear him and have no idea what he 's saying . " " And puts stumbling blocks before the blind , does n't he ? " " Who else will fall over them ? " " When he takes a man 's cloak as a pledge in the morning , he still wo n't give it back to him at sundown , will he ? So the poor beggar will have something warm to sleep in at night . " " How else can he be sure he 'll be able to collect ? " " Sure , collect . I 'll give him collect . That 's the whole point of the commandment , damn it , that the man wo n't be forced into paying before he can afford to . The quality of mercy is not strained . You do n't know that ? It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath . Do n't you understand Exodus and Deuteronomy ? " " I do n't read that stuff anymore .

He 'll be good for the economy of the kingdom . " " He 'll be rotten for the kingdom , " I reply .

" Almost always , " I amend myself sheepishly . " That was adultery , David . And you knew it , even when we were doing it . And you know what Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , Deuteronomy , and Nathan have to say about that . " Abishag the Shunammite is certainly getting an education just listening to us , I muse , although she tries not to stare and pretends not to hear . " Come , let us reason together , " I suggest more quietly , in my most diplomatic manner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange gods . He 'll bankrupt the kingdom with his apes and his ivory and his peacocks . Do you know what he wants for a throne ? Here 's what he told me he wants for a throne : a great throne of ivory overlaid with best gold , and two carved lions standing by the stays of the throne and twelve more lions  --  twelve  --  standing there on one side and on the other upon the six steps . " " That sounds divine , " Bathsheba says with a straight face . Is it any wonder I 'm still so crazy about her ? " Fourteen lions ? " I exclaim . " Or maybe he means twenty-six . He thinks I should have a throne like that too . " " If Solomon has lions , " she says , nodding , " you should have lions too . And so should I. " So different is she from constant , unselfish Abigail , for whom my regard was always higher , and my passion so much less . When Abigail died I was lonely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't going to take to a throne like that , " I think out loud , feasting my eyes upon a face and form so beautiful to me still . " Ours does n't go in that much for ostentation . " " Ours loves Solomon , " Bathsheba insists , " and will go along with anything Solomon wants . " " Do n't bet on it , " I disagree .

" But the poor is hateth even of his own neighbor . " " What makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Solomon say it , and I thought it was very wise . Why do you ask ? " " He got it from me , " I tell her coldly , " that 's why I ask . You 'll find it among my proverbs . " " Solomon has lots of proverbs too , " she boasts . " And the best of them , " I tell her , " are mine . The next thing you know , he 'll be claiming he wrote my famous elegy . " " What famous elegy ? " asks my wife . For the moment I am struck completely dumb . " What famous elegy ? " My piercing cry is one of indignation . " What the hell do you mean , what famous elegy ? My famous elegy , on the death of Saul and Jonathan . What other famous elegy is there ? " " I do n't think I ever heard of it . " " You never heard of it ? " I am beside myself with disbelief .

" she inquires . " What , then ? " I demand . " Who the fuck do you think wrote it ? " " Solomon ? " " Solomon ? " I shout . I have a queasy sensation that none of what is taking place now is really happening . " This was ten years before I even moved to Jerusalem ! " I roar at her . " They were telling it in Gath , they were publishing it in the streets of Askelon , a dozen years before I even met you . You do n't remember it 's mine ? Solomon ? How the fuck could Solomon have written it when he was n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross , " she reproaches me . " You know how hopeless I 've always been about dates . " She seats herself beside me on my bed and places her hand on my chest . For a second , it is like old times . My member thickens slightly . My senses are imbued with the sensual odors of myrrh , cassia , and sweet calamus radiating from her tissues and  | garments as though from an ivory palace . " Do n't , " she says when I drop my hand upon her knee . " You did n't used to mind . " I am now the one who is imploring . " Life does n't stand still , " she observes . " Another proverb from Solomon ? " " It moves along , " she continues without having heard me . " David , " she appeals , " I feel danger in my bones . Nathan fears that a royal banquet with Adonijah presiding could make prisoners of us all . Even of you . " " That 's funny , " I reply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to tell me he thinks it 's a fine idea . " " Abiathar ? " she repeats vacantly , as though the name were an alien sound she had never heard before . " The one who 's been around me just about all my life , " I remind her tartly , " since my days as a fugitive . " " You know how bad I 've always been with names , " she says , faking , and heaves a heavy sigh . " So many A 's . Who can keep track of them all ? Abigail , Ahinoam , Abishai  --  and now an Abiathar . " " Not now . For fifty years . " " I sometimes think that Benaiah and I are the only B 's in the whole country . " " Abiathar is my priest , " I remind her slowly of what we both appreciate she knows very well . " He was one of the first to join up with me , right after Saul killed his father . " " Zadok is your priest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your prophet , " she counters . " Nathan is a windbag , and he never did approve of you , you know . " " And a prophet is higher than a priest , " she calmly goes right on as though she did not hear me speak . " Nathan does n't think you can trust Adonijah . Goodness gracious , another A. We even have an Abishag now . And what was the name of that dead wife of yours , the dowdy one who never spoke ? Abital , the mother of Shepatiah . " " I thought you were bad with names . " " And A 's are bad luck . Asahel , and Ahitophel , Amnon , Absalom , Abner , Amasa  --  look what happened to them all . Darling , " she wheedles , and I reflect as she leans down toward me again that an expression so quintessentially good just has to be composed of nothing but duplicity , " promise me that you will never pick as king anyone whose name begins with the letter A. That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my breath . " I 'll give that request some  | serious consideration , " I tell her , and wonder just how senile she thinks I fucking am . " Yesterday , " Bathsheba starts right in the following morning , " you gave me your word that you would never name Adonijah king . " She is wearing a fiery red robe of chiffon , and her head is adorned with a diadem of pearls and other precious gems . She is still so provocative when she dresses up that I want , as always , to tear off her clothes and strip her naked . . " That 's not the way I remember it , " I answer , admiring her effrontery . " Abishag was here and heard what you said . " Abishag is steadfast in discretion as she sits at her stand of cosmetic pots , and I know she will never betray me . " Do n't you know that Abishag will be witness to whatever I want her to be ? " I reply to Bathsheba with pride . " What smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another one of her nimble changes of subject that never fail to bedazzle me . She looks timorous as a rabbit as she wrinkles her nose , exposing her tiny , chipped teeth . " Someone open a window . " I laugh . Abishag displays dimples when she smiles . A coppery rouge she is applying to her face highlights the domes of her rich brown cheeks . What smells , of course , is me , musty , linty , withering , old-aging me . They have perfumed my bed with aloes , cinnamon , and myrrh , but I still smell me . I stink of mortality and reek of mankind . Pungent frankincense smolders everywhere in my palace . There are maybe a thousand incense burners . It must cost me a king 's ransom each year in aromatic gums and resins . No wonder our balance of trade is poor . There is antiseptic myrrh and honey in the sweet-smelling ointments and medicines with which Abishag dresses my scratches and bedsores . My rashes and pimples she covers with a poultice of figs . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and is always entirely at my service . She glides about gracefully on soundless steps , her carriage poised in perfect alignment . There is never a moment of imbalance . Do I imagine Abishag the Shunammite , construct her out of wishes ? She is as fragrant as grapes on a mountain of spices and like apples of gold in a picture of silver . She is vibrant with bliss when I pet and stroke her and cup her face in my hand and softly rest her head upon my chest or in the hollow of my shoulder . I regret in such moments of soulful union that the dear girl did not know me at my best , long before the hair on my chest turned white . The glory of young men is their strength , you know , and the  | beauty of old men is their gray hair . God knows I 've got plenty of that kind of beauty now , but Abishag confides that she is drawn to the white hair on my chest . She caresses me there often , fingering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would not like a shaggy one , she admits with a pout , a man like Esau with bushy growths on his shoulders and back . It seems I fit the bill , if the child is not lying , and I know she is not . In Shunem , Abishag informs us with native candor when queried , her father owns good land and her life was opulent . She kept the vineyards of the other children of her mother and neglected her own . The youngest and shyest in her large , flourishing family , she was often jollied by the others and was readily self-persuaded of her own inadequacies . To them it was play . She has always been anxious for praise . That same relentless inclination to please and sacrifice herself for others is manifest now with me . I wish I were sufficiently spry to do things for her . I would like to serve her a meal now and then , help her on or off with her clothing , carry in for her use a basin of fresh water , or bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found her for me because she was the most beautiful virgin to be located throughout all the coasts of Israel . I induce her to talk . I love hearing her . " I remember the song with which they used to tease me and make me so unhappy , " she relates in her lowered voice . " We have a little sister and she has no breasts . ' Once they sang it about me at a wedding . I hid my face in my hands and ran out into the darkness . I wanted to die . I did not return until morning . I did not answer when I heard them searching for me . I wept on the ground , feeling frail as a leaf , and slept amid melons near the roots of trees . " " You have breasts now , " I comfort her . " Are they too small ? " " For what ? " My smile is indulgent . " For you . " " I 'm a little past seventy , dearest , " I counsel her apologetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you too . Because you are beautiful , and because you have been with a king . " " Am I more beautiful than Bathsheba ? " " Much more beautiful . " " Than when you saw her the first time ? " " You are a garden enclosed , a spring shut up , a fountain sealed . You are more beautiful to Inc now than anyone in the world has ever been . " She would trade both my sons for me . I know how to talk to a woman now and they do not . I icr darkly nippled breasts are like twin roes that  | feed among the lilies , her perfect buttocks like matched hinds . I am the first person in her life who delights in conversing with her , who will listen entranced to her replies and to all her casual meditations . Where could she find another like me ? She knows she is free now to say to me without shame anything that comes to her mind , and she knows that to me she can never say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks she is deeply in love with me and feels secure . When her head does rest in the hollow of my shoulder , I trace with my thumb the contour of her brow or the line of the side of her nose to the yielding rim of her spongy upper lip , which , in the dimming hues of my flickering and guttering lamplight , is the color of plums or pomegranate . I caress her that way addictively , insatiably . What good would the world be to me now without my Abishag ? No other man she ever meets will draw as much happiness from her as I do , from simply contemplating her face and touching it , from the plain awareness of her presence . Through Abishag the Shunammite I now know about myself what I learned from Bathsheba and had forgotten , that all my life I have wanted to be in love . I can kiss her ears , her temples , neck , and eyes until the insides of my cheeks grow parched and my words barely audible , and then go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble with dryness . For reasons I can not know , I frequently shy away from kissing her fully on the mouth . She is my rose of Sharon , I have told her from my heart with my face in her hair and my breath upon her ear , and she is my lily of the valley . I have made her more contented by doing just that than Bathsheba would be were I to yield to her entreaties and give my kingdom to Solomon . Bathsheba would feel relief but no gratitude , never gratitude ; and in less than half a day she would feel herself unjustly disadvantaged again in some other respect and be anguished prey to the need for something else . As with the alabaster bathtub . No sooner had she moved into my palace than she asked for a bathtub of alabaster and got one . Michal yelled blue murder and got an alabaster bathtub too . What do women want , I have often wondered aloud in moods of matrimonial exasperation ; what in the world do women want ? An answer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I dropped in to rest . " It takes very little to make us happy , " Abigail explained , " and more than is contained in heaven and earth to keep us that way . " " That 's a discerning answer , Abigail , " I said . " And I shall always be  | so very , very grateful for your intelligence and your kindness . Would you like a bathtub of alabaster too ? " " No thank you , David . I 'm perfectly content with the one I have . " " You never ask for anything , do you ? " " I have everything I need to be happy . " " Are you the woman who 's the exception to what you 've just de-scribed ? " Abigail smiled once more . " Perhaps I 'm the exception . " " Is n't there anything you want , my darling ? Really , Abigail , I would like to give you something . " Abigail shook her head . " No , David , there is n't . My cup runneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a very sweet thing to say . I will remember it always . " What Bathsheba wants now for her own quarters are my enormous , lush cushions of ramskin and badger dyed red and dyed blue . Solomon , she reflects , will let her have them when he is king . Solomon , I have fun in reminding her , will not be king . " Suppose , " she conjectures , " Adonijah dies . " " Do n't you dare , " I admonish her with a penetrating glance , " even give one moment 's thought to a possibility like that . Why should Adonijah die ? " " I 've always wanted to have skin like yours , " she replies , to Abishag . " Mine was never so smooth and silken . Even now I 'd give anything to be that dark .

" Save for a Persian rug in my dining room that she knows is expensive and a tapestry wall-hanging of umber and viridian that depicts two pairs of cherubims of ocher with outspread wings touching , everything in my rooms is inferior to Bathsheba 's standard , although the posts of my doors are of olive tree . Bathsheba does not like wood from olive trees . My bed , I think , is of applewood . Adonijah and Solomon both already lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches . Bathsheba would also like a bed of ivory upon which to stretch herself . I ) id you hear her before , that cunt ? With her " What famous elegy ? " She knew , of course .

A man going into another 's woman is attempting to usurp the prerogatives of that other 's office . You know what Absalom did in the sight of the sun with those ten concubines I left behind to keep the palace clean . You think it was because they were so beautiful ? A streak of pragmatic electioneering is involved in the sporting eye Adonijah now rolls at Abishag . And canny Bathsheba is wary that I might encourage the union .

Then she comes alive with  | He 'll give you permission if we nag him enough . Will you let her marry Solomon ? Hey , David , give me an answer , do n't just lie there like a pancake .

" Otherwise you might have to sleep with that conceited monkey Adonijah if he 's the one that gets to be king . You 'll belong to his harem . " " And so , " I say with a malicious emphasis , " will you . " Her stricken gasp is music to my ears , her look of stunned revulsion a feast for sore eyes . Is it possible to hear a face fall ? " That 's impossible ! " she declares , as though able to nullify by her mere opposition all of the natural laws of society and the universe . " He inherits the harem , " I point out smugly . " He 'll want to lie with me ? " " It 's out of the question ? " " Deuteronomy wo n't stop him ? Leviticus ? A son can lie with the wife of his father ? " " Has Leviticus stopped others ? " " He 'll really want to ? That 's not disgusting ? " " Do n't I want to ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stupid not to . What better way to solidify his rule than to possess the favorite wife of the former king ? " " Well , my son Solomon , " she asserts through drawn lips , " would never allow that . My son Solomon would kill him if he tried . " " Your son Solomon , " I warn her , staring fully into her face , " will probably be dead in a matter of seconds if you keep this up , you dear , designing , confused old goose . " I have begun like a lion and am concluding like a lamb . " And so will you be if you do n't give up your campaign instantly and become more discreet . Did n't I warn you from the day he was born that you would be placing both your lives in jeopardy if you did n't stop talking about him as the future king ?

" Was n't I giving you the best head you ever had ? "  | very pleased with myself . " How could I tell if it was good or not ? But that 's hardly going to carry much weight with Adonijah if you do n't start doing everything possible to make him like you and get on his good side now . " " I think I would rather die , " says Bathsheba with her jaw lifted stubbornly . " That just might be the alternative , " I caution her sternly . " You 're playing politics and you do n't know how . And I will not be alive to save you when you fail . There is just no way , no way in the world , you can succeed in making Solomon king . " For only one moment does she appear to be sobered . And then the spell is over . " There is always a way , " she responds , as though thinking aloud , " where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon ? " " That one was mine . " " What does it mean ? " " I do n't think I know . " " Well , it does n't make any sense . Now will you please desist from your kingmaking ? Dye your hair again , or tweeze some hairs from your mole , or invent more underwear . It 's just no contest . Adonijah will be king , and Solomon will not . " But hope , unfortunately , springs eternal in the human breast , and I know that this wife of mine is not the type to comply . I rail introspectively again at the libidinous male vanity that made me want so many wives when younger . Look at the trouble they cause me . And their children too . Celibacy has few pleasures , I know , but marriage has many pains . And harems are not always what they 're cracked up to be . Rarely in the long run are they worth the cost and endless bother . They congest the palace with people , noise , and odors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewage disposal , which are already hopelessly insurmountable throughout this raucous , teeming city . So many people these days are pissing against the walls that they practically have to wear boots . It 's futile to try to divert any of my sons from their pleasures and personal goals to contend with the commonplace problems of civic administration . A lot they care , these fruits of my unions . And if marriage has many pains , polygamous marriage multiplies those pains to an unforeseeable extent with the commotion generating from squabbling wives and contending offspring . Even God 's faithful servant Abraham had his poor hands full , did n't he ? In the beginning there was Abraham , in that first Jewish family ,  | madic fold for mocking the second son Isaac at the celebration of his weaning and for any future aggressions against him foreshadowed by that action . Ishmael , the son of that alien bondswoman Hagar , was an archer who would turn out to be a wild man with his hand against every man , and with every man 's hand against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when Abraham was finally rid of Hagar and Ishmael , guess what he did next . He took another wife ! He had six more children ! And at his age ? He needed more children ? Like a hole in the head . He could n't live without another wife ? A man like him so full of years ? I guess he did need another woman . Sex is so powerful in this Mediterranean heat , and I was not the first to turn at times as horny as a goat . Reuben humped Bilhah , and Judah swerved off the road to stick it to the woman in harlot 's dress who proved to be his dead son 's wife . Lust is n't bad in a warm climate with long dry summers . Return , 0 my Shunammite , that I might fondle and contemplate thee once more . Bathsheba , my old love , stretch thyself down beside me and place your fat ass in my hands again ; open thy legs to me as thou did in the past , that I might indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , that joy that cometh in the morning . Lay your sleeping head , my love , upon my arm , I wish when most sad to croon to her , as though a full lifetime of enchantments still were in store , for we must needs love each other or die . Saul had no harem  --  I was the first in Israel to think up that extravagance  --  but he had troubles enough without one after Samuel dumped him . Saul begged to be pardoned for his transgression and for Samuel to r- urn to him so that he could continue worshipping the Lord . What was so ba ? about taking some cattle and sparing a king for ransom ? The Lord has fo . ! iven worse . But Samuel would not be swayed . As he whirled to depart , Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle to detain him , and it rent . S ? me days Saul could n't do anything right ; that day was among his worst . A. d Samuel said unto Saul stringently , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine , hat is better than thou . " 4 ow , strictly speaking , this was not true . In fact , it was a bald lie , for i was not until afterward , in Samuel I , Chapter 16 , that the Lord , rep - ting that He had made Saul king over Israel , commanded Samuel to : o to Jesse of Bethlehem to find the king He had provided Himself from a ' ong Jesse 's sons . The rest , of course , is history , and everything occurring in the uni-  | eminence I 've enjoyed . Samuel came to Bethlehem with his red heifer on a rope . The elders of the town trembled at his arrival , of course , until he assured them he had come in peace to sacrifice to the Lord . No one but me would have questioned why he had to come to Bethlehem in Judah to sacrifice . They had no altars in Benjamin ? He calls for Jesse and his sons and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when none of my brothers could qualify with God . The spirit of the Lord came upon me from that day forward , and the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul at that identical time , leaving him mad as a hatter and lonely as a stone . In no time at all he was ready for the nuthouse . Saul 's basic failing , I believe , was a parochial inability to understand that the same theocracy plucking him up from a hillside meadow to be ruler over Israel would be quick to disown him as soon as he began to reign like one . His offenses were inconsequential . At Michmash , earlier , Saul performed the sacrifice before battle when Samuel was late showing up . That was n't his fault . When his men were famished , they ate meat with the blood . That was n't his fault either , and he castigated them for having done so . And who but God could blame him for his failure to follow through on his curse and execute Jonathan ? For this you fire a king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the beneficiary . I never had such conflicts with prophets and priests , thanks to Saul , who left a clear path for me by reducing their number and their authority . What did it cost me to throw Zadok and Abiathar a smile and a nod every now and then , to resign myself to the garrulous homilies of Nathan when I had to ? We had no temples or synagogues , no rabbis , and we could forget to observe the Passover each year if we had something more entertaining to do . We kindled fires on the Sabbath and could even work if we wanted to . No one reprimanded us for keeping our household idols . We had no daily or weekly prayers to recite , and our God , like the slumbering volcano He once was reputed to be , was dormant for the most part , and tended to say little when He was n't talking to me . All I had to do was bring a lamb to the altar of the priests every once in a while ; they slaughtered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fellow , and a very merry Christmas to all of you as well ; of course I 'll be happy to come again . Neither God nor Saul ever thought of naming another Judge to follow Samuel , and Saul kept near him no prophet or priest . What was the poor creature to do ? It is n't easy to be a king if you 've got no real feel for the job and no footsteps of a predecessor in which to follow . No wonder he worried . ( ; real wonder , though , that he plunged into the first  | departed from him and moved to me , and that I was the one they sent for to snap him out of it . For reasons still mysterious to me , I was already known in Gibeah as someone with a cunning hand on the harp and a person skilled in the arts of war . I had never even been to war . But I could carry a tune and I was damned good with the sling . As far as anyone knows , Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel anointed me , other than a single episode of religious ecstasy with other prophesying fantatics among whom he chanced to fall and with whom he went dancing about wildly down the mountain , stripped off his clothes , and rolled about naked in the dirt awhile with his mouth frothing . That would have been tip-off enough of trouble to come to anyone less enamored than God with the concept of His own infallibility . How I loved that man Saul . How I looked up to him , even when he drove me away and hunted me ; how I yearned to be sealed into his embrace and taken into his household as a member of his family . That never happened . He meant more to me than God . I still have dreams about Saul ; I have never in my life had a dream about God . My dreams of Saul are of longing , remorse , and reconciliation . When they sent to fetch me to cure him , I walked from Bethlehem to Gibeah as though every step were on hallowed ground . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way I felt out of breath from awe . He was Saul the famous , I was going to meet him . He was my lord the king . He was the savior of Israel , the military leader who had routed at Jabesh-gilead the besieging Ammonites for his first big victory , and had trounced the Philistines at Michmash for his next . And now he was feeling low . Irony of irony , said the Preacher , that I , the unwitting cause of his disease , was called upon to supply the remedy . I wanted to call him father . I did call him father . Each time I addressed him as my lord the king , I was calling him father . Each time he answered , he called me his son . In the years I was near him , I wanted to hug him . In the years I was distant , I wanted to be back . He was impassive in affection and kept me at bay . He said he would make me his armor bearer and forgot to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said I would be to him always as one of his own sons . Had I known at that time how he felt about his children , this would have been cause for concern . When I arrived with my harp at the mud-brick house in Gibeah , they invited me to bathe my feet . Of course I jumped at the chance . I soaked my tired feet in cool water in a clay basin awhile and dried them thnrnuvhly with the wwilrn tnwrla't rredl me 1 Wnllnwe11 timirlIv tr tho.  | doorway to which I was led . I stepped through the entrance alone into the low-roofed chamber in which Saul had been brooding so terribly in silence and in solitude . My heart sank the minute I saw him . My lord the king was clearly in a very bad way . A tall and barrel-chested man of almost unbelievably massive muscular development , he was slumped forward like something inanimate in a half-reclining position on a small wooden bench at the rear of the room . His shoulders sagged and his head was hanging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-browned forearms , heavily veined , lay limp on his thighs . At first he did not stir and he struck me tragically as a mighty machine fallen into disuse . There was a minute in which I was frightened . He sat with an expression of resigned and incurable agony , diffusing a silent gloom that seemed to me almost as painful to witness as to suffer . The room was dim , the atmosphere thick , but the entire experience was nothing at all as you may have been led to imagine it was by Robert Browning  --  no , not the least bit like Robert Browning . Why listen to him ? I was there , Browning was n't ; he was in Italy sending home thoughts from abroad . At no time did Saul climb laboriously to his feet like a man weighted with an unutterable misery and unfold his tortured physique with upraised arms extended sideways to station himself in the figure of a cross . Crucifixion was a Roman invention , not a Hebrew , and this was a thousand years before the Romans even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with fire and stone them with stones , and we did very little of either . It was so much easier to tolerate our sinners and live with the headaches they gave us than to judge them and kill them . Why make a fuss ? More often than not , we would leave them to heaven or simply have somebody fall with their swords on our enemies . And here 's something else : not a one of us then would have cared a pinch of snuff about any second coming of a Messiah , let alone a first , or even said a single word about either . Who needed a Messiah ? We had no heaven , we had no hell , we had no eternity , we had no afterlife . We had no need for a Messiah then , and we have none now , and the last thing any sensible human being should want , to my way of thinking , is immortality . As it is , life lasts too long for most of us . I 'm not even sure we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did seem to have a need to believe in Him . I do know that just about every good idea emerging in my chats with Him originated with me . The plan of stealing through the mulberry trees to encircle the Philistines at night at the second battle of Rephaim was I ! is . But I 'm not sure it made that much difference , or that I would n't have thought of it myself . I do  | know that Joab 's idea of attacking them frontally at dawn did not sit well with me . Saul , by the wretched , inert look of him , probably held a different attitude from mine about the need for a God . Although a foot basin had been prepared for him and placed nearby , his toes and ankles were caked with the dust of the earth . Shapeless slippers of sheepskin lay overturned on their sides near the wall against which his javelin and his spear leaned with their points upward . A mat of roped wool was unrolled on the floor , with a bolster of coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saul spurned a bed and slept on the ground . I had no doubt he knew I was there from the instant I entered . It took awhile , though , before he stirred and turned slowly to contemplate me . He lifted his hand above his eyes as though to shade them from the glare from the doorway behind me . I stared back at him intently . He looked like a man who wanted to weep . He had that desolate , ruined look of someone in love . I know that lifeless , empty anguish of love from my first years with Bathsheba when things were going so frenetically well , and know it also from those endless fits of longing afterward when they began so uncontrollably to change . In good times and in bad , those incomparable requirements of the aching heart seldom lessened much . " Who are you ? " Saul asked at last , pathetically , almost whispering from a throat that sounded inordinately dry . " I have trouble remembering things . " I was choked for a moment by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nausea . " I am David , the son of your subject Jesse the Bethlehemite . " " I have trouble remembering , " he repeated . " I am going to play for you , " I told him . " Are you going to play for me ? " he inquired distantly , and paused for some answer from me with his mouth hanging open , like a man with a stroke . " I am going to play and sing for you . " " They tell me , " he mused inquiringly , " that music hath charms to soothe the savage breast . " " I 've often heard that too , " I answered meekly in my youthful tenor as pure as a choirboy 's . But frankly , I did n't put much stock in that adage . My nephew Joab has always owned as savage a breast as existed anywhere in the world , and the effect upon him of my music has always been to exacerbate rather than tranquilize his turbulent nature . Even as children of the same age growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always put a gulf of antagonistic incompatibility between us . He would jog and lift weights ; and I would compose an ode to a daffodil . With an apathetic nod , Saul signaled for me to enter farther and find what I thought was a suitable place , and then he looked away with downcast eyes and waited . I had come to Gibeah with my eight-stringed lyre in order to demonstrate my considerable technical skill to fullest advantage . Now I clasped the instrument tightly to my chest in an effort to conceal the trembling of my hands . My mouth felt paralyzed . Saul appeared no longer interested . Tensely , I made myself ready on a low stool , with one bare knee bent to the ground . I licked my lips and upper palate with a tongue that felt stiff , and I tried to begin . My first note smothered in my gullet with a little muffled sound , almost a croak . I was grateful Saul did n't seem to be paying attention . My voice quavered off key on the two notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I saw him quiver and start with surprise at the first full touch of my fingers to the strings , as though the tremulous chords lingering in the air were setting in motion somewhere inside him sympathetic vibrations of response that resonated through his entire being . My confidence was restored without my even realizing it was back . I felt in firm control and knew with certainty that I was sounding better and better as I went on , singing like an angel in a voice that was too young for a man 's and too sweet for a girl 's . I began with a simple and brief Russian lullaby of my mother 's with which she used to croon me to sleep when I was a child and afraid of the dark and which in later years she would hum to herself about the house when content . Saul heard me attentively and was pleased , I thought , and I proceeded boldly to some lengthier and more complex inventions of my own . Of arms and the man I sang , of the wrath of Achilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that order , little supposing in my arcadian naivete that I was embroidering on topics which would either excite his prejudices and anger him , or move him to nostalgia and compunction . Lucky for me it was the latter . In my fortuitous choice of subject matter I might well have been unknowingly guided by a higher power , and then again I might not have been . I heard Saul sigh . I saw his limbs relax and gently regain their flexibility . I watched the dark , rigid lines of his face disappear , saw his expression loosen itself from the grip of fatalistic despair and soften into an attitude of pensive reverie . His head began to dip ever so slightly in tempo with the melodic flow of my music . I was pleased by these visible proofs of my success . What a splendid  | and inspiring picture I must have made ! I was so white and ruddy . And it was obvious I was working miracles . While the last notes of my epic on man 's first disobedience to God still floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a smile . He flexed his shoulders as though rediscovering his ability to move them and then stretched out his arms . He opened wide his jaws and yawned serenely . I concluded my performance with my early ode to a daffodil . Of course I was eager to do more . For a change of pace , I had in mind for an encore , had he insisted upon one , a lively and mildly risque ditty of my own about a passionate shepherd to his mistress . But Saul stood up from his bench like a man exhausted who knows what he is about and informed me with a gesture that he had heard enough and was satisfied . He shambled slowly across the room and lowered himself to his sleeping mat with a moan of content , sitting in utter silence for several moments with his arms crossed upon his knees . I feared again that he had forgotten me . I did not want to move . The sound of his breathing was loud and regular . After another minute had passed , he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I approached diffidently and knelt to the level of his eyes when I was before him . He took my head delicately in both his enormous hands and looked deeply into my face with a kind of reverent and solemn gratitude . My heart beat rapidly . " I will never forget you , " he told me in a low voice . " I shall want you always with me . You shall be to me as one of my children . As of morning tomorrow , I will want you to serve me as my armor bearer . " I spent the night in my cloak on a smooth dry patch of earth I located near the front corner of his house . I could not sleep much . My mind was a carnival of glittering hopes and dizzying expectations . In the morning they sent me away . When Saul and I again faced each other two years afterward on the day of my killing of Goliath , it was as though he had never set eyes on me before .  | In the service of Saul I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more I succeeded , the more I failed . I survived and excelled and began to get a name for myself for smiting Philistines . You think Saul was proud ? Jonathan was . Even Abner approved of my cunning , prudence , valor , and growing military reputation . But there was just no pleasing Saul with anything after the first time he beheld for himself the women coming out of the cities of Israel with tabrets , with joy , and with instruments of music to greet me and to answer one another melodiously , singing : 100.9 ' iircty r i ; r : 1'fl i - i- fi Or , in translation : " Saul bath slain his thousands and David his ten thousands . " What could I do if I was turning out to be ten times the warrior Saul was ? Nevertheless , it perplexed me tremendously to see him grow so very wroth . If looks could kill , I would have been finished , and he eyed me narrowly from that day and forward , even after I was his son-in-law and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house in Gibeah . Who could eat with so much aggravation ? I can clearly recall the hour that my fortunes with Saul took their disquieting turn for the worse . We were buoyantly trooping along homeward , in jaunty return from another victory over the Philistines in which I had again acquitted myself with distinction . Then the women came out with their tabrets and other instruments of playing to sing of Saul 's thousands and my ten thousands . Their refrain was music to my ears , and I grinned , of course , honestly anticipating that Saul would rejoice with some display of paternal pride in the acclaim I was receiving . I could not have been more mistaken . It was with a startled and lowering face that Saul heard them . I saw him look daggers at me as he quickened our  | women had been left behind , Saul drew Abner with him in my direction as though to make inescapably certain I would overhear his words and observe his reprimanding demeanor . " They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard them . " " Ten thousands ? You heard ? " " I heard , I heard , " answered Abner uncomfortably . " And to me they have ascribed but thousands . You heard that too ? " " I heard them , I heard them . " " He was nowhere near ten thousand . " " You know how women are . " " But I achieved my thousands , did n't I ? " " Easily . " " They were singing just for him  --  you heard them , did n't you ? ? and dancing for him too . They were paying practically no attention to me . You saw ? You heard ? " " I heard , I heard , " said Abner . " What do you want from me ? I 've heard them before . " " You heard them before ? " demanded Saul . " When ? " " Lots of times . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " " Why should I aggravate you ? " Saul was glaring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more to satisfy him than the kingdom ? " To tell you the truth , something akin to that very thought had been rattling around in my own mind since the time I joined Saul and began doing so well , but always , I swear , with the airiness of an adolescent fancy rather than the constancy of a vaulting ambition that might someday overleap itself . I made no play for the throne of Saul until after he was dead . Ask anyone . Ask Achish , king of Gath . To understand my bafflement , keep in mind that I was but a child at the time , as green about the ears as a youth from the country could be , with little knowledge of the corroding perversities and ambivalences with which the human heart is capable of polluting itself . Who could conceive back then of the enormity of Saul 's brooding hatred for me or comprehend the threatening paradox that the more I accomplished to gratify him , the greater would grow the jealousy and wrath he felt toward me ? I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first time , and I was flustered in a queer and guilt-ridden way each time I found him so  | The evil spirit came upon Saul for the second time in his life the very next day . Word spread fast through Gibeah that he was again in a state of mysterious melancholia . I took my harp from its kidskin cover at the first report and waited . Saul could not stir from his chamber , rumor had it . He would not taste food or wash his hands or the dust of the earth from his feet . He had no desire for sex . He refused to comb his hair or clean his fingernails . When they lit the olive oil in his lamps , he blew out the flames , muttering uncivilly that he preferred to curse the darkness . They thought of me quickly . No more time-wasting attempts to stay him with flagons or comfort him with apples . Music , they wanted . I jumped at the invitation to play and sing for him , at the opportunity to return to his favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was tortured . I felt blessed by Abner 's supplications , singled out by heaven as someone meant for unique things , touched with sublime grace by the magical quality of my music to heal . And once again , I was Johnny-on-the-spot . I began my serenade to Saul most delicately with my pure and innocent singing voice and my eight-stringed lyre . I was as divine as a castrato . Nothing but the best for my king . I knew by the lucid timbre of the first note from my lips that I had never been better . Again I was privileged to observe the gently restorative effects of my genius as my plaintive melody pervaded his overburdened consciousness . Before my eyes he began to recover , emerging astonishingly from the state of catatonic depression into which he had plummeted overnight and in which I had found him when I entered . He stirred , he moved , he rediscovered himself , he came back among the living . And I had conducted him there . It was marvelous to behold . As I glided without hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul stiffly moved his head from side to side , as though searching for my tempo and testing his authority over his neural impulses . He arched his back , then reached his arms out to the side with the elbows bent and rotated the knobs of his shoulders in their girdles of muscle . At last he raised his clouded face to study me . He wore the doleful look of a man who had been given shattering news some time before and who only now felt able to begin pulling himself together . I was glad when . I saw him regarding me with what I would call a look of deep gratitude and undying devotion . There was no doubt he knew I had saved him . He smiled slightly , apologetically , a spark of understanding igniting in his bleary , swollen eyes as he made me out and recognized mc . I felt redeemed ? now he would be more indebted to me than ever before . I gazed at him in happiness . The next thing I knew , the crazy son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud thwack in a beam of wood beside me , the quivering shaft humming only inches from my ear . Who would believe it ? The bastard was really trying to kill me ! For moments I sat there unable to move , my mouth agape , until he dived for a second javelin to fire at me and missed again . Then I bolted to my feet in terror and avoided the hell out of his presence as fast as my legs would carry me . Abner was unperturbed when I related to him what had occurred . " You have got to learn to take the bad with the good , " he advised me philosophically , scratching his pitted face with one hand and pausing to suck on a pomegranate he held in the other . " He missed you , did n't he ? " " Twice . " " So what are you complaining about ? It 's not as though he hit you , is it ? " " Can you at least get my harp back ? It 's the best one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Abner , returning with my lyre , " is to stay out of his presence until he has a change of heart . " Saul made that easy by removing me from him . I expected death or demotion . Instead , he appointed me a captain over a thousand . Then he dispatched me on combat missions in remote places with bands of a dozen or two dozen men against invading mobs of Philistines moving into the valleys or pillaging or occupying our villages in northern Israel or southern Judah . Dutifully , I went out whithersoever Saul sent me and behaved myself wisely in all my ways , endeavoring to gladden him by doing so . Fat chance . All Israel and Judah seemed to grow to love me because I went out and came in before them on my triumphant forays of liberation and safekeeping . But not Saul . The more wisely I behaved , the more afraid and resentful of me he appeared . My desperate , self-defeating efforts to propitiate him were maddening in their futility . I was at a loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . What endures as one of the regrettable facts of my life is that my future father-in-law and I were never again to be at ease with each other after that first episode with the javelins . What had I done to deserve that ? You tell me . It seemed to me that we both continued delving for a solution to that riddle and could arrive at only the same one : nothing . Such an answer was equally disturbing to us both . But his attitude of sullen grievance and simmering fury never abated fully . I felt myself in continual peril , and in a continual mood of repentance . How was it possible to atone to this patriarchal figure for what I had not done ? At best each of us was embarrassing to the other . It was obvious at other times that he could not tear the sight of me without manifesting visible symptoms of a turbulent  | and menacing agitation . His antipathy was evident to all about him and a matter of nervous concern to Jonathan and others . I myself could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he want from me ? Who could dream back then that , because of Samuel , he was wrestling every day with an impulse to slay me that was close to ungovernable ? The malignant fuck was sending me out on these undermanned expeditions to distant places in the pathetic and distracted hope he could let the hand of the Philistines be upon me instead of his own . Saul was of the opinion  --  with good reason , perhaps  --  that I was loved by God . And he feared , therefore , when in his right mind , to slay me himself . What Saul was attempting with me was what I was much later to perform with more successful results against that unfortunate sucker Uriah the Hittite . I did n't want to slay him myself , yet I had to be free to marry his wife before the indications of her pregnancy grew undeniably evident . There is no new thing under the sun , is there , certainly no new plots . Show me anything whereof it may be said " See , this is new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are only four basic plots in life anyway , and nine in literature , and everything else is but variation , vanity , and vexation of spirit . I sure as hell know I did n't feel loved by God in this tempestuous period . Instead , I felt much vexation of spirit , for Saul clearly loathed me incessantly with an animosity that was unappeasable . The error I committed in my trusting naivete was to assume that he really meant what he said in his logical wish that I triumph over his enemies . But he was enraged and demented each time that I did . You could have knocked me over with a feather again , therefore , when a delegation of his servants arrived to tell me that Saul 's daughter loved me and that Saul wanted me to be his son-in-law . Such is the vanity of human wishes that in no time at all I was able to trick myself into believing he now approved of me . All is vanity , you know , all , all in the long run is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time at all , it became to me the most natural thing in the world that the king 's daughter should be in love with me . In retrospect , I see that the more unusual phenomenon was that I took to combat as easily as I did , as though destined for it from birth . I was never warlike as a child . People forget that Goliath was the first man I had ever killed . I had never even been to battle before . Reports that I was a man of war and a valiant man are but the lacework of hero worship ; otherwise I would already have been on the scene in the trenches of Shochoh , would n't I ? Saviors who capture the imagination traditionally arrive unheralded from obscure or pedestrian origins . That was true of  | me . Where would the climax be if I were merely one famed fighter who 'd triumphed over another ? Achilles ' defeat of Hector is the weakest part of the Iliad  --  he was the odds-on favorite going in . Homer was really not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , of course , Homer was stuck with the truth . Growing up in Bethlehem , I did n't care much for games of war or group activities of any kind . I was never the equal in enthusiasm of my nephews Joab , Abishai , and Asahel for the manly martial arts they indulged in for fun . Because I was the last born in a large family and they were the earliest offspring of my oldest sister , Zeruiah , we were near to each other in age . I was always more deft with the less highly regarded sling and preferred casting stones by myself  --  a solitary , romantic figure , I thought , meditating on my poetry and musical compositions as I did so , and simultaneously safeguarding my sheep . Joab and the others would spend carefree , exhausting hours lifting weights and doing push-ups and wind sprints , and smashing things with their makeshift hammers and axes in games of war against imaginary hordes of Philistines . I slung stones in far-off pastures ; I composed my celebrated " Air for the G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though blind at the graying , unshorn rumps of my small herd of sheep . My fame as a gifted young composer and as a prodigy with a cunning hand on the harp was , however , well deserved and widely known about the countryside while I was still in my teens . I do n't think Joab valued that at all . Joab always was churlish on the subject of my songwriting . To Joab , all male singers are suspect , and male dancers too . I 'm sure he thought I was queer . To me , on the other hand , the man that hath no music in himself is fit for treasons , stratagems , and spoils , and often I defiantly told that to Joab in just those words , even after I was king . I was also , as I may have hinted , fantastically good-looking as a young man , even pretty in a faintly feminine way . I doubt he liked that either . I never would give him or anyone else satisfaction by pretending to minimize the immense pleasure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my self-deprecating ways . Old women clucked over me , young wives and unmarried girls fixed longing stares upon me , and even occasional strange men traveling through would give a start of surprise upon catching sight of me and stare at me hard with inquiring expressions freighted heavily with something more insinuating than normal objective appreciation . I was a comely person and knew I made a good appearance . There was that neck of mine that has been compared to a tower of ivory , and my bushy locks that have been described as black as a raven 's  --  and not  | just by me . I am not exaggerating when I tell you I often witnessed the most beautiful of my sheep bleat with desire and turn their heads to make wistful cow 's eyes at me . To me , therefore , it shortly began to seem not at all extraordinary that the king 's daughter Michal had fallen in love with me . Why should n't she ? Was n't my skin whiter than milk and more ruddy than rubies ? Who was around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain men for self-delusion that I soon reasoned it equally plausible that Saul would so welcome my marriage to his daughter as to make things simple for me in the matter of the means to pay for her . It did not cross my mind that he might spy in the amorous inclination of his daughter an opportunity to set a snare for me by which he thought to make me fall by the hand of the Philistines . " Is the king displeased ? " I inquired when informed that Michal loved me . " He wants you to be his son-in-law , " Abner answered concisely . Only afterward did I discern that the answer he gave was not to my question . Abner never proved easy for me . " I had the impression he did n't like me , " I said diffidently . " You 're first on his list . " " Who am I ? " I demurred , with appropriate humility . " And what is my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son-in-law to the king ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He really likes me ? " " When you go out and fight with the Philistines , " Abner reminded , skillfully begging the question again , " you slay them with a great slaughter , and they flee from you . " " Does the king notice that ? " " Is there salt in the sea ? " " He never says anything in praise of me . " " You know he is shy . " " He gives me the feeling sometimes that he 's afraid I am up to something . " I squirmed a moment . " What better way to pacify that fear than to make you a member of his house and keep you close to him ? " " Would that really do it ? " " It was my suggestion . " " Can one say no to a king ? " I asked rhetorically . " Does a bull have tits ? "  | " Does the wild ass bray when he hath grass ? " " Have we got all day , David ? " Abner never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am a poor man , " I cautioned with proper modesty , getting right down to the gist of the matter . " I have no money , I have no land . Even those few poor sheep I used to watch in the wilderness were my father Jesse 's , and not my own . " Abner replied with amusement . " Does the king need money ? Does Saul suffer in want for land or sheep ? " " Are the sands of the desert made of silver ? " I replied brightly . " Or the weeds of the forest made of gold ? " continued Abner , with that deficiency of emotion that rendered him always an enigma to me . " Saul is the king and can always take as much money , land , and sheep as he chooses . No , the king desireth not any such dowry for his daughter . He wants but a token , some tangible earnest of good faith . " " What tangible earnest ? " I asked warily . " A trifle , a pittance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father or you or leave you even temporarily strapped . Saul does not want wealth . " " With what will I pay for her , then ? " I was now constrained to ask . " With a pound of flesh , " was the answer I got . " A pound of flesh ? " I echoed with surprise . " Or ten or twelve ounces , whatever they all add up to , " Abner remarked in an offhanded way . He watched me levelly with hooded eyes . I had trouble figuring it out . " What kind of flesh ? " " Philistine flesh . " " I just do n't get it , " I admitted frankly . " Foreskins , " said Abner with exaggerated patience , as though I had been privy to all conversations and was obtuse in overlooking a fundamental point . " The king wants foreskins . Bring him but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of his enemies , and you shall be his son-in-law . That 's all that he wants . A hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I understood . A hundred Philistine foreskins ? I could bring him a thousand ! " I will give him two hundred ! " I cried exultantly , in a mixture of boastful liberality and conservative good sense . " When does he want them ? " " The sooner the better , I should think , " Abner decided , " from everyone 's point of view . While she still has her looks and is young . enough to bear children . Saul wants grandsons . " " t.n afar . at inrw  | " How long will it take ? You can have what men you need . " You would have been charmed by the proficiency with which I began calculating aloud . Abner appeared spellbound . It would require , I projected fluently , a minimum of four able-bodied young Israelites to take hold of a live Philistine and wrest him motionless to the earth in a supine position , a fifth to lay hands on his privy parts and elevate his member with a firmness sufficient to overcome any spontaneous urges to flinch from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure hand on the blade to trim the Philistine foreskin expertly from the glans of the penis . I have a mania for neatness in some matters that is almost anal . The last two men could contribute with their weight to the total force necessary to hold the unconsenting subject pinned in place on the ground . I was not counting on voluntary compliance . Allowing about an hour , on average , to locate and seize each Philistine for circumcision , and working with four squads of six men taking their daylight nourishment on the prowl rather than breaking for lunch , I estimated hopefully that we could gather daily Abner abruptly shook free from the trance in which he had been listening to me . " David , David , " he interrupted . He rolled his eyes skyward and weakly raised a hand , requesting forbearance . " I think you may be missing the underlying goal of this exploit . We want you to kill the Philistines , not convert them . We do n't care if you bring back the whole prick . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings in a squeal of rapturous hallelujahs . I was able to perceive that killing the Philistines and bringing back the whole prick would facilitate my task considerably . But who would believe it ? Who would figure for even one second that someone as artless as Saul could construct so diabolic a snare to secure by the hand of the Philistines the downfall of the man who had begun to assume in his disordered brain the sacred aura of the being picked by God to replace him ? Not I for one , not by a long shot , not until the nefarious details of the Machiavellian scheme were unfolded to me by Jonathan long afterward and then confirmed by my wife Michal the night she entreated me in near hysterics to get my ass out the window fast if I was interested in saving it . And not my bluff nephew Joab , for another , who leaped at the chance when I invited him to assist me as my captain of twenty-four . Even back then , hale Joab desired nothing better than to charge into strife against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why . It was blunt Joab who one spring , at that time when kings again went forth to  | through Turkey into the Crimea to conquer and occupy Russia and Asia first and then all of the rest of Europe as far northward as Scandinavia and as far to the west as Iberia and the British Isles , even unto the Irish Republic . " We go to war in the spring , after our harvests are in , " was the first of the objections I raised with Joab . " They go to war in autumn , after their harvests are in . How could we get together ? " " We can leave in the spring when our harvests are in and fall upon them in the summer before their harvests are in , " Joab answered plainly . " What would you eat if you fall upon them in the summer and do n't have the grain of their threshing floors to live on ? " " We could bring along dried figs , " he replied . " In Scandinavia we could live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his grand proposal , instead of renewing my campaign against the Ammonites in Jordan and the Syrians to the north . What a name I would have for myself now ! Who needed so much sand and rock ? I did n't have enough ? It 's no puzzle to me any longer that Saul looked so disappointed at the completion of my labor , when I reappeared before him in Gibeah in excellent health and presented the contents of my basket to him in full tale . I was worried initially that he was discontented with the quality of the foreskins or of the Philistine pricks , but I had alerted Joab to leave behind any that were the least bit deficient in size or symmetry , and I had witnessed him sorting through our daily catch diligently . Not until we were half a day 's march out of Gibeah had I leaked a word to Joab or anyone else about the peculiar objectives of the quest upon which we were embarked . My information was electrifying . " Foreskins ? " The question sounded from my swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of the gazelles that are in the open field . " David , why foreskins ? " " Who knows ? " I answered candidly . I paused a moment for dramatic effect , licking my lips the while in appreciation of the impact I knew was to follow , and I was flushed with pride in myself when I continued in a rising voice . " It is the dowry Saul hath requested I bring him that I might be that day the king 's son-in-law . I am going to marry his daughter Michal . " The loudest exclamation among the cries of surprise that resulted was the one erupting from Joab , who seized my arm in his hand and glared at me in disbelief . " Michal ! " he repeated loudly . " Is that what you said ? Michal ? "  | Naturally I was taken aback . " What 's wrong ? " " I just do n't get it , " asserted Joab , thrown into a rage as usual by anything he failed to comprehend . " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry the king 's daughter Michal ? " " Why should n't I marry the king 's daughter Michal ? " " I thought Jonathan was the one you loved . " I was jolted . " Are you crazy ? " I demanded . " Where the hell did you ever get that idea ? " " From Jonathan , " Joab returned at once . " Your soul is knit with his soul , is n't it ? " " Says who ? " " Says him , " Joab shot back . " He gave you his girdle , did n't he , and his sword and his bow , and his robe and other garments . He tells everyone in Gibeah he loves you as his own soul . " " His soul is knit with my soul , not mine with his , " I argued . " There 's a difference ? " " A big difference , " I replied with dignity . " Now let 's get going , if you do n't mind . " But Joab persisted , pulling me aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rough , David , " he said with worry . " Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? " " They tell me she loves me . " " You still might be better off marrying Jonathan . " " Let 's go get those foreskins , " I ordered brusquely . This time it was Asahel who appeared determined to thwart me . " Foreskins are dangerous , David , " softly warned brave Asahel , who would die not from Philistines but on the hinder end of Abner 's spear when he would not turn aside from pursuing him in his unremitting chase after a battle in our long civil war . " They take lots of hard work . Whose idea was that anyway ? Abner 's ? Circumcising Philistines is bad news , David , very bad news . " " Well , here comes the good news , " I fairly burst out in reply . " They want us to kill the Philistines , not convert them . They say we can bring back the whole prick ! " My announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prick " shortly became a folk saying utilized in conversation as widely as the proverb about Saul and the prophets after he fell into that spell with them the first time , and then the second . When I gave the command to regroup , my little band of stouthearted men let out a wild , frolicsome cheer , and away we traipsed with the gaiety of schoolboys unleashed  | early from class , augmenting our morale with the lusty chorusing of a jolly bit of opportune doggerel I was successful in extemporizing for the occasion , to wit : " Hi-ho , hi-ho . It 's down to Gath we go . Who 'll give two pins To get foreskins ? Hi-ho , hi-ho . " My racy pun was received with hilarity , I am satisfied to recall . I knew exactly where to take my men to find Philistines alone or in groups of two or three . Downward I led them toward Gath , through the rugged mountains of my native Judah into the low hills descending gradually to the marshy plains of the Philistines as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man famed in song for having slain tens of thousands of Philistines . The second was child 's play as well . Saul should have been much better prepared psychologically for the likelihood of my success . The trip back was a triumph marred only by some curious disturbances that were wholly unexpected . This time when the women came out of the cities with their psalteries and cymbals and tabrets , they sang : " Saul has taken his thousand foreskins. and David has taken his ten thousands . " Who else had ever been as heroic in so novel an achievement , or lauded so robustly in song by women ? How thrilled I was to be present to hear them . How relieved I felt that Saul was not . As we were almost through that first village , though , all at once , with no warning whatsoever of what was to come , a piercing shriek rent the air and a buxom woman of ripe years fell into the loudest and most terrible fit of weeping I had ever heard . Pointing into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch , she howled : " Urgat is dead ! Urgat the Philistine is dead ! Vey 's mir . Urgat is dead ! " The uproar that ensued was indescribable . Other women hurried to her side to hold and console her . Two or three of them began wailing mournfully as well . But others in the crowd were reacting differently , with faces scowling in callous disapproval . Men 's brows darken-  | minds moved sullenly through deduction to arrive at irate conclusions . " Stone her ! Stone her ! " the cry went up in a minute . " Spare her ! Spare her ! " others rallied in her defense . " Is n't she suffering enough ? " " Urgat the Philistine is dead ! " " What 's going on ? " I inquired of the only person in sight who seemed in his - right mind , a shrunken , white-bearded old man with twinkling light eyes who was taking the whole scene in calmly . " May her thigh rot and her belly swell with salt water , " he remarked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pardon ? " He spoke a little louder , smiling , " May her thigh rot and her belly swell with salt water . " We were glad to get out of there . But in the next village , which was but a mile or two distant , the identical thing occurred , except that in this second place there were scores of women who were grief-stricken . Again we were all of us refreshed by the general welcome we received as we neared . Again the women in their bright-colored holiday dresses , again the singing and dancing , again the refrain : " Saul has taken his thousand foreskins and David has taken his ten thousands . " Here as we walked along we were gorged with presents of dates and figs and sesame cakes of almonds and honey . And then all of a sudden that same fucking shriek . Again there was that shock of recognition , again the mood of celebration was shattered by a heart-stopping cry , again the deafening sobs of heartbreak and loss , again those undulating , inconsolable lamentations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead  --  Urgat the Philistine was gone . But here the bereaved women appeared in a violent majority and soon were assailing us with feet and fists over the death of their favorite Philistine . One of them rushed at my face with her fingernails and raked my cheek and my neck into long bloody scratches . The bewildering uproar was out of control . I tell you truthfully it was no easy matter to fend off these countrywomen of ours without smiting them hip and thigh . " What the hell is happening here ? " cried out my nephew Abishai , who normally was as unexcitable as it is possible for a living thing to be . " Mix them all up ! " I bellowed an order to Joab , indicating with alarm our heap of penises in the basket . " Cover the pile ! "  | even more booming . " Cover the cart ! The cart , cover the cart ! Which one of you mothers killed Urgat ? " It was a miracle indeed that we escaped with our lives . " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ! " was the imprecation I yelled back at all of the women in that entire village . The cart covered , and the territories of Philistia left farther and farther to the rear , it was roses , roses , all the way , one victory carnival after another , until we arrived back in Gibeah and I had counted out to the foreskin the two hundred trophies I had brought Saul , who scrutinized me darkly the whole time with a venomous malice , as though , in honoring his request , I had arrogantly confirmed his blackest intuitions and fantasies . True to his word , he would give me his daughter Michal to wife . He knew , he said , that the Lord was with me , but the way in which he uttered this opinion sent a shiver down my back . He did not dance at my wedding . Neither did Michal . I hardly stopped . Oh , what a good time I had ! Egged on by her brothers and her more convivial cousins and uncles and aunts , I danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heels and my knees higher and higher until the skirt of my tunic was awhirl about my waist and I knew at last that my tossing genitals were in open view and could be observed by all present except the blind and the dying . The ovation I received was thunderous . We drank like Ephraimites and perspired like pigs . One goblet of wine after another Jonathan and his brothers poured into me . Every once in a while , I noticed that Michal and Saul were not having much fun . With rigid and censorious countenances , both kept stubbornly in the background and held themselves aloof from the festivities , the unhappy pair looking , I thought , as though the father had eaten a sour grape and the daughter 's teeth had been set on edge . The chilling presentiment struck me as I went reeling happily past and caught her tight , reproachful eyes fixed upon me that it was always going to be impossible for me to please her for long . And the thought crossed my mind that my nephew Joab had perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off marrying Jonathan instead . So riotous a good time did I have at my wedding party that six times  --  six  --  I was compelled to desist from my carousing to stagger outside the main door of Saul 's house in Gibeah to piss against his front wall . They told me later that six was a record for a young man . The party ending , the musicians and singers departing , unruly revelers carried us homeward through the streets by torchlight in separate mauve blankets of wool , raucously bellowing obscene songs of the multitudinous nuptial couplings to follow . I joined in giddily in a voice as  | out of Michal the whole evening . Saul had handed her over to me as wife . I had set her to one side to acknowledge with bows the cheers of her relatives . No one from my family had been invited . Comfortably recumbent on my back , I could not see over the border of my blanket and was lazily reluctant to try . " Michal ? " I inquired . " Are you there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoots of merriment from the young men bearing us broke out at these words , and I felt emboldened , after an instant 's uneasiness , to laugh along with them . At the entrance to the dwelling Saul had allotted us , they stood me up and lifted her into my arms . I carried her across the threshold and pulled the door shut behind me . I knew I was in for trouble when I set her down on her feet and beheld the austere look with which she was regarding me . Her eyes , naturally small to begin with , were screwed into glinting , beady pinpoints . Any possibilities that I might be mistaken about her humor were dispelled by her first words . " Go take a bath , " she directed , with a mouth drawn into a taut , bloodless line . " Wash under your arms . Make sure you comb your hair after you 've dried it , the back of your head too . Rinse your teeth with a mouthwash . Use a perfume on your face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all spick-andspan , after complying meticulously with her instructions . She confronted me with her arms folded , as obdurate as a wall , and said nothing . I was as meek as Moses , who at times , as you know , was the meekest man on earth , and importuned her in an abject whimper when I could endure her silence no longer . " Is anything wrong ? " I made myself ask . " What could be wrong ? " she answered with a shrug , eyeing me coldly . " You do n't seem to be saying much to me . " " What 's there to say ? " A martyred look accompanied this reply , belying her air of passionless indifference . " You seem to be angry about something . " " Angry ? " She spoke with sarcasm , dilating her eyes in mock surprise . " Why should I be angry ? What 's there to be angry about ? Do I have anything to be angry about ? " I felt the ground growing shakier beneath me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? " " What 's there to talk about ? " " Michal , " I cajoled.  | " Must I always call you princess ? " " If you hope for a civil response . " " If there 's anything I 've done wrong , " I begged her almost apologetically , " I 'd like you to tell me about it . " " What 's there to tell ? " she answered with another exaggerated shrug of unconcern . And then , after a menacing silence of about ten seconds during which she seemed to be marking off the time , she proceeded to say a great deal . " That you shamed me and disgraced me in front of my father and my brothers ? On my wedding night yet ? You did it , David , you did it to me , by drinking and dancing and singing , by having a good time like an ordinary drunken lout . That was gross , David , really gross . " I tried reasoning with her . " Michal , your brothers were the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were doing the same thing . " " My brothers , " she let me know , " are the sons of a king who can do whatever they want and never be gross . You are gross for suggesting they 're gross . I guess I 'm only getting what I deserve . " Her voice dipped an octave and she seemed to be blinking back tears . " I never should have married a commoner . " I continued trying to reason with her in a manner most conciliatory . " Michal , my dear ? " " Princess Michal , " she broke in . " Anybody you married had to be commoner . Saul is our first king and we have no aristocracy . You are n't being entirely fair . " " Where does it say I have to be fair ? " she retorted . " Show me where it 's written that I have to be fair . And how dare you , from Judah , accuse me , a princess , of being unfair ? You did n't find me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gutter , that 's where I found you . " " Michal , " I corrected her firmly , " I was at the head of a parade when you saw me in the gutter . I was a hero and everyone was cheering me . That was right after I slew Goliath . " " Who ? " she asked . " Goliath , the giant , the Philistine champion everyone was afraid of , even your father . You painted your face and sat by the window to see me , did n't you ? Of course I was in the gutter . Did you expect them to hold the parade on the sidewalk ? " " We have no sidewalks in Gibeah . " " So ? Anyone you found would have to have been in the gutter . " " But I took you out , " she asserted , and adamantly crossed her arms . " Saul took me out , by letting me go no more home to my father and  | then making me captain of a thousand . He sent word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I looked at her longingly and asked , " Michal , are n't you in love with me , at least a little ? " " Yes , David , I am in love with you , " she admitted , relenting slightly . " But only in my own fashion , as a member of the royal family who expects always to be obeyed . " " Your Highness . " " That 's better . Promise you will always remember that you are married to a princess . " " I very much doubt you will let me forget it , " I replied . " I will want you to bathe every night and to brush your teeth after every meal . Always use deodorants . You must wash your hands with strong soap after defecating and urinating , especially before you start preparing my food . Always make sure that your hair is combed , especially in the back . I ca n't stand a man with flat hair in the back ; it always looks as though he 's been lying down and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . That 's gross . " " I 'm not picking my nose . I never pick my nose . " " Do n't contradict me . That 's gross too . Never fart . " " Never ? " " That 's what I said . You must change your clothes when you come home each afternoon . Can a man be at ease in the evening with the raiment he wore in the day ? " " I do all right . " " I will want you to sleep in pajamas . File your nails and keep them clean . I like well-groomed men with an air of authority who dress impeccably and always smell of soap and deodorants . " " I will do my best . " " I want to be mother to a great race of kings . " " I 'll do my best with that too . " Mollified at last , she relaxed her arms , and we moved side by side to the mat of straw unrolled on the floor . Our bed had not been delivered yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and sank down beneath me . She was no longer a virgin when she rose to her feet less than ten seconds later . " Well , thank God that 's over with , " said the first of my brides on our wedding night . " I certainly hope we have a son so I 'll never have to go through that again ! " It took but an instant for her words to sink in with all their implications and for me to comprehend the seriousness of my plight . Michal , my  | bride , was not just the daughter of a king but a bona-fide Jewish American Princess ! I had married a Jnr ! I am the first in the Old Testament to be stuck with one . M IC H n r. , DID NOT conceive a son on our wedding night and looked as crabby as Saul in disillusionment with me when the custom of women was upon her and it was unmistakably clear I had fallen short of her expectations in that solitary connubial encounter . As soon as her flowers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her menstrual impurity , she summoned me back to her side with a grimace of painful submission to a duty that was repugnant , and permitted me to get into her pants for the second time . In the interim , she had caused me to sleep by myself on a narrow couch in the chamber adjacent to hers . By that time , all our furniture had arrived . Saul had provided us with a fine two-story house in a good neighborhood of Gibeah , and both our private rooms were on the upper floor , separated from each other by a door of limed wattle . Again there was but one quick coupling , followed by another month of inviolable abstinence and deprivation in which I was banished each evening to my lonely couch in the other room . Something told me the results would be no more fruitful than before , yet I held my tongue until the new moon waxed full once more and the custom of women was upon her again . Never was there a woman , I 'll bet , who suffered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I failed miserably in my efforts to convince her that , statistically at the least , she was reducing enormously the chances for impregnation by this puritanical rhythm system of sexual congress she was imposing so inflexibly . She thought my efforts at persuasion were bestial , self-serving , and gross . " You must not think I am frigid , " she edified me . " It 's just that I do n't ever like being unclean , not even for a minute . You must have noticed that I bathe every day . " By that time , so did I. And even in those first disenchanting months of our marriage , I quickly discovered that I had much bigger problems to contend with than bathing regularly or a nagging and fastidious wife . Specifically , there was my father-in-law , Saul , who was yet the more afraid of me than formerly and had become my enemy continually . Saul was not so determined as his daughter that she be mother to a great race of kings . Ile was more obsessed with seeing me dead , consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him : he could not bear having me alive , he did not dare harm me . I its terming paranoid mind found testimony every-  | my slaughter himself if he wanted me out of the way . Certainly against the Philistines I seemed to have a charmed life . God was not going to let him off the hook . It had to happen , I suppose , that he would finally round the bend , and the day inevitably arrived when he lost self-control and spoke to Jonathan and all his servants that they should kill me . Now how do you like that for a development ? That was some fortunate marriage I had made , was n't it ? Jonathan , who delighted in me much  --  why should n't he delight in me much ? ? was the first to tip me off , exhorting me to take heed of myself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide myself . Did Saul care at all that his daughter would be a widow ? All night long I lay huddled in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as caring and as tender to me as Abishag the Shunammite turned out to be too late in my life . I thanked God fervently when I learned at dawn the next day that Jonathan had been triumphant in remonstrating with his father and inducing him to rescind his drastic orders against me . " Let not the king sin against his servant , against David , " Jonathan reported to me he had said , " because he hath not sinned against thee , and because his words toward thee have been very good . He slew the Philistine and did put his life in thy hand . Thou sawest it and didst rejoice at first . " " The Lord loves him , Jonathan . " Saul was perturbed . " So much the better , my father . Wherefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood , to slay David without a cause ? " Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan and spoke with a radiant face , as though the scales were dropping from his eyes and he was all at once illuminated from within by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Saul burst out , " he shall not be slain . I swear from the heart . Bring him to me this same evening and it shall be with him as in times past . There shall not be bad blood between us again . " Jonathan acquainted me with all these things and brought me into Saul 's presence that day , and it was better than it had been in times past . Saul sat me at his right hand , honoring me . He looked with favor on me throughout my dinner , helped me to food , addressed me constantly , paid me compliments , catering to me throughout as though I were his most beloved son and he was making amends . Never in my life had I felt so complete as I did that evening . Never had I felt so serenely at one with my king and master and with the fulfilled miracle of my existence . There could be no doubt in my mind that our reconciliation was whole when , afterward , he took me alone to accompany him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending incline just outside the  | beside each other in silence along a path of turned soil between rows of broken stalks whose sheaves had already been bound and borne away for threshing and winnowing . A prize of some kind should be given to the person who first figured out what could be done with grain . The aromas of the earth were as good wine . There was something mystical in that starry night , the gigantic orange harvest moon so low and pregnant , the lush black , depthless sky brilliant and shimmering with hard flickers of white and gold as numerous as the sands of the sea . The heavens were so close a part of the density of our air that I felt I was sucking immortality into my lungs with every breath . An exquisite surprise came when Saul lifted his huge , gnarled hand to lower it ever so lightly upon the back of my head . And I felt for the second time in my life that I had been touched magically by someone godlike , fatherly , and immortal and brought somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beginnings of that kind are incredibly sublime : falling in love with Bathsheba was incredibly sublime . Just once before had I experienced that same profoundly satisfying feeling of being born afresh , when they brought me from Bethlehem to play for Saul and he took my face in his hands afterward to gaze into my eyes with such transfixing intensity and make me those deepsworn promises that were forgotten by him and everyone else in the morning . I had never suffered such dismal disappointment . " David , my son , I have a thing I must reveal to you , " he began hoarsely as we walked in starlight that balmy evening . " Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown . Believe me , I know . " Continuing in a low voice embarrassingly frank in its bare contrition , he imparted to me a good deal about his history . Much of it was untrue . When I reflect on the candor with which we addressed each other in that conversation , I am astonished to recall that it was our longest and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind . For most of his young life he had thought of himself as ungainly and clumsy , because of a great height that stood him head and shoulders above others about him . " Maybe that 's the only reason I was picked , " he conjectured dolefully , as though ruminating over a familiar mystery . " From my shoulders and upward I was aways higher than any of the other people . They used to ask me how the air was up there . To tell you the truth , I never gave much thought to God , and I was as unprepared as anyone to hear from Samuel that I was the one whom the Lord had chosen to be captain over Ills inheritance . " " You believe Samuel ? " I inquired . " What choice do I have ? He thinks about the Lord , I do n't . I believed  | And to tell me another truth , Saul confided that he had not been all that happy with his selection then and was not too pleased with his situation now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His sole ambition the day Samuel plucked him out of obscurity was to find those lost asses of his father , which had been gone for three days . And Saul , unlike his daughter Michal , made no bones about the fact that he was from one of the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin . I effectively used this knowledge in marital disputes with Michal long after he was dead and I had succeeded in replacing him . When she sought to demean me by calling me a shepherd , I retaliated that her father had been an assherd , and from one of the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin to boot . Invariably , these arguments came down to the same basic disagreement , whether it was superior to be the daughter of a king or to be the king himself . I always won : I always proved my point by having her dragged from my room back to her place in the harem . " Power corrupts , I 've noticed , " he observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And absolute power corrupts absolutely . I can have done whatever I want to . No one now interferes . Not even Samuel . Jonathan will try to talk to me sometimes , but even he will submit to my commands . Would you believe this , David  --  I 've never told this to a soul  --  would you believe that the thought once crossed my mind , just for a second , you must know , to have you killed ? Can you believe that ? " " No . " " We must never breathe a word about that to anybody . " " Why were you going to have me killed ? " " To teach you a lesson , I think . " " What lesson ? " " I sometimes have trouble figuring things like that out . The trouble with me , " Saul resumed after a pause , " is that I almost never have more than one idea in my head at a time . Once I can think of something to do , I do it . People give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news of the siege at Jabesh-gilead . It was all that came to mind . There was this yoke of oxen right before me  --  I had just come after the herd out of the field  --  and all I could think of was to hew them in pieces and send them throughout all the coasts of Israel as a warning to the people of what would be done to the oxen of those who did not send people to aid me . My only hesitations were over who to send pieces to and how to hack up the oxen to make sure there 'd be enough . I did n't want to use  | " What would you have done if the threat failed and the people had not responded ? " I had long wondered about that . " I 'm not much good at looking ahead , " admitted Saul . Saul 's first action as king , overcoming the Ammonites to lift the siege of Jabesh-gilead , was his best , and nothing in his life after that became him so much as the leaving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gilboa , by one account , when he found himself too sorely wounded of the archers to flee , and his armor bearer , sore afraid , declined his request to thrust him through and finish him off before the Philistines found him alive and abused him . The armor bearer , seeing Saul dead , fell likewise upon his sword and died with him . Something like that happened to Brutus at Philippi , did n't it , and to Marc Antony after Actium , according to that gonoph William Shakespeare , who pilfered from Plutarch too , as well as from Saul and me . A bard of Avon they called him yet . Some bard . Him I have to be measured against ? In my day , a bard like him would be rolling out pancake dough in the street of bakers in Jerusalem or shrinking cloth in the fullers ' field . 0 that mine adversary had written a book , instead of that mulligan stew of jumbled five-act plays with stupid plots cluttered with warm bodies and filled with sound and fury and signifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll give a Nobel prize for literature yet someday . And I still wo n't have a book of the Bible named after me , unless I rewrite the whole thing myself , and who has so much time ? While nobodies like Obadiah , Nehemiah , Zephaniah , Habakkuk , and Zechariah do . Believe me , it 's not what you know , but who you know . But fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise , and I do n't give up hoping . At any rate , Saul did die gallantly  --  stupidly but gallantly  --  and I pay lofty and eloquent tribute to him in my famous elegy . I did better by him than he ever did by me . I immortalize him . Why criticize ? The good that men do lives after them , while the evil is oft interred with their bones . So let it be with Saul , I decided , and made no mention at all of his killing of the priests , that bloody nut , and his occasional spells of looniness with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enchanted night when I made bold to allude most gingerly to his weird episode with the prophets , about which all of us had heard . " I still do n't know what came over me . " He shook his head disconsolately , affirming with embarrassment that reports of the epileptic religious seizure into which he had fallen were not unfounded . " Nothing like that had ever happened to me before . " It did happen to him once more since , when he was engrossed in  | Ramah , where I had fled with Samuel after escaping out my window in the nick of time with the skin of my teeth . What followed seemed a miracle . Just when we had abandoned all hope of evading him , Saul was possessed once again by an irresistible need to prophesy . And he stripped off his clothes and lay down naked in a swoon all that day and all that night . Crazy ? You tell me . Regaining his senses in the morning , he was a man of weakened resolution , and he turned tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery of the fit of religious ecstasy by which he had been so helplessly overwhelmed . Freud and his followers could explain that naked swoon  --  and would probably be wrong . As Samuel had foretold in that first encounter with Saul , which was so fraught with consequences for the future , Saul did meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place of a hill of God with a psaltery , and a tabret , and a pipe , and a harp . And as Samuel had instructed , Saul did go up to prophesy with them , to allow the spirit of the Lord to come upon him and to be turned into another man . " I ca n't really explain what happened to me after that . " The next thing he knew , he was lying on the ground at the bottom of the hill , surrounded by the small crowd of gaping onlookers who had been attracted by the unusual spectacle . He was mortified and disoriented . " My memory of the whole event is still the most terrifying of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people gaping at him was he able to reconstruct what had happened  --  that he had done the dervish in company with these fanatical enthusiasts , howled out the mantras , harmonized the Hare Krishnas , stripped off his clothing , and gone tumbling down the hill with the others to lie thrashing about in the dust in a foaming , spastic , orgiastic frenzy . " My chin was still wet from drooling . I did not know how to go about finding my cloak to cover my nakedness . I have never been so ashamed in my life . " Of course he was recognized as the son of Kish by disbelieving neighbors astonished to see him in such a state . He was further disconcerted by the murmurs of ridicule resonating among them with the facile repetitiveness that transmutes conversational statements into tiresome proverbs . " Is Saul also among the prophets ? " he heard more times than he could count . " What then ? It 's not Saul among the prophets ? " " Can Saul be among the prophets ? " " Calif f.a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can Saul be among the prophets ? " " Go give a look . " " With my own eyes I saw Saul among the prophets . " Is it any wonder there were many opposed to accepting Saul the son of Kish as king ? " I would have had trouble enough without that . After all , I was only the son of Kish , a Benjamite , of the smallest of the tribes of Israel , and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin . What did I know about management , religion , or warfare ? " Filthy children of Belial , Samuel called the people who rejected Saul because they did not see how such a man could save them . These despised Saul and brought him no presents , and Saul went home to Gibeah and held his peace until the Ammonites came up and encamped against Jabeshgilead . " That was my chance , " observed Saul . " As Goliath was mine , " I could not help reminding . Saul went on without bestowing upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nahash the Ammonite came up out of the desert and encamped against the city , all the men of Jabesh were ready to surrender and serve , and they sued for peace . As a condition of peace , Nahash wanted to thrust out the right eye of all of them . This seemed not unreasonable to me . " I saw it as a sign of weakness too , " Saul agreed . " So I took that yoke of oxen , and hewed them in pieces , and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers , saying that whoever cameth not forth after me and after Samuel , so would it be done unto his oxen . " The act to me seemed less effective as threat than as drama ; yet the fear of the Lord fell on the people , and they came out with one consent . Dividing his men in three companies , Saul moved into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day . Those that remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . It was a famous victory . " When I was growing up in Bethlehem , " I disclosed shyly , " we often used to play at war , and one of our favorite games was to play at war as Saul against Nahash at Jabesh-gilead . We loved the part of hewing the oxen into pieces . " " And which role did you play ? " Saul asked quickly , fixing a searching gaze upon me . I felt a fleeting chill . " None of us ever took the role of an enemy . " " Did you ever wish to play the part of one of the oxen ? " It seemed  | " All of us wished to take the part of the king . " " Do you still wish to take the part of the king ? " The jarring presence of something dangerous in the atmosphere was now unmistakable . " All of us wished to play the part of the hero , my lord , " I replied as tactfully as I knew how . " Of our hero Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord in Gilgal by all the people , because he gathered an army as he did and saved Jabesh , and all of the men of Israel could rejoice greatly in him . " My flattery was disarming , and I watched his face soften and his symptoms of apprehension recede . Everything for him after that , he recounted , was downhill . His impressive victory over the Philistines at Michmash was blighted by his quarrel with Samuel over the performance of the sacrifice and by the implacable resistance after the battle of the people serving him , who would not let one hair of Jonathan 's head fall to the ground when Saul sought to make him die . His success against the Amelekites led to his second quarrel with Samuel and the final breach in their relationship . " What was I supposed to do when Samuel failed to arrive before the battle of Michmash to sacrifice the sacrifice ? " Saul wondered out loud , haunted anew by a quandary which eternally confounded him . " Was it my fault or his ? He was late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the number of Philistines increase . We could have swept them away easily if we had struck right away . No Samuel . I had come with an army eager to fight , but steadily they beheld the Philistines gathering themselves together in greater and greater numbers , with chariots and with horsemen and with people that began to look like the sand which is on the seashore in multitude . Still no Samuel . When the men of Israel saw the strait they were in , they were distressed , and they did scatter from me and hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits . And some of my Hebrews even went back over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead . We were n't supposed to fight until we had first made supplication to the Lord with a sacrifice . We could n't sacrifice without Samuel . No Samuel . When the seven days appointed passed and there was still no Samuel , I finally offered the burnt offering myself . No sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already there . He told me I had done foolishly and that my kingdom would not now continue , that the Lord hath sought Him a man after I lis own heart and had commanded him to be captain over the people instead of inc . ' So fast ? ' I cried . ' The burnt offering is n't even cold yet ! " l le built the world in seven days , ' Samuel answered . " " Six , " I could not help interjecting.  | " Exactly . " Saul gave a single nod of his head . " Samuel is n't perfect , ou see . And I think he was at least as much to blame as I was . Can one eason with God ? I was expected to win , was n't I ? Well , I did win , without Samuel , and maybe even without God . And then after the big ictory , there was all that trouble with my son Jonathan . I hope you never Lave from your children the troubles I get from mine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did to you ? " I exclaimed , gawking . " You 've never heard ? " " Tasting the honey ? " " After I put a ban upon eating until evening ? And a curse before God In any man who violated it ? " " You think God expected you to kill your son for tasting a bit of Loney ? " " You think he did n't ? When I built an altar unto the Lord that day nd asked counsel whether to go down after the Philistines , I got no nswer , no answer at all . That 's how I first knew somebody had done omething wrong . " " Did Jonathan know of your ban ? " " Sure he knew , " Saul answered promptly , lying . " It was no secret . What was I to do when I found him out ? " " Ask God ? " I guessed . " Ask God , " he repeated , and looked at me pityingly . " What good is sod ? God would n't tell me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame Jonathan for that ? " " I have n't killed him , have I ? " And then Samuel came no more to see him after repudiating Saul 's ctions following his triumph over the Amelekites . Taking King Agag for ansom and the best of the cattle for booty , instead of putting all to the word as instructed , was only the second or third of Saul 's lapses , and his only act of noncompliance ; yet it was enough for Samuel to depart from dm forever , taking God with him . " He told me it was the last straw , " Saul continued moodily . " He sewed Agag to pieces and went to his home in Ramah . He told me the , ord had rent the kingdom from me . " " For just one act of disobedience ? " I wondered aloud in sympathy . " Not even Adam was given a second chance . " " Adam talked with God directly . You have only Samuel 's word . " " Samuel told me to be king . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute in silence and then turned his face to look at mine . " Is there word from the Lord , David ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " My manner was wary , his was crafty . " Has God ever spoken to you ? " " If He has , I did n't notice . " At that time , my answer was true . " What happens when you sacrifice ? " asked Saul . " I do n't sacrifice . " " Do you know what happens when I sacrifice ? Nothing . The meat does n't burn , the fat hardly melts . " " Maybe you need a hotter fire , " I suggested , " or better meat . " He paid no attention to my guesses . " I get no omens , I get no advice . God just does n't answer me anymore . " " Maybe God is dead . " " How can God be dead ? " " God ca n't be dead ? " " If God was dead , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I urged . " Go to the priests . " " I do n't trust the priests , they side with Samuel . " And Samuel had rejected him in the presence of the elders . Samuel came no more to see Saul , as it turned out , until the night before Saul 's death . And then it was Samuel 's spirit , summoned by the witch of Endor . " I think he wanted me to be king , " Saul theorized , " but he wanted to be the one who ruled . When he left that day , he told me that the Lord had already given the kingdom to a neighbor of mine that was better than me . " Saul glanced at me intently again , his brow beetling . " David , were you the neighbor he meant ? " My answer was fearful . " I have no way of knowing , my lord . I was not there ? " " David , David , " Saul interrupted impatiently , " I am drained of choler . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own sons . Did Samuel make you a king ? " " Only God can make a king , " I replied . " If God is dead ? " Now he had me . " There 's only Samuel . " " We know he traveled to Bethlehem , " said Saul . " He came with a red heifer on a rope that he said was to sacrifice . We know he stopped in your father 's house and went no farther , and we know they sent to fetch you where you were keeping the sheep . He went back with the heifer . David , David , did Samuel make you king ? " There was no room left to temporize . " I le put oil on my face , " 1  | replied , " and told me the Lord had provided for me to be king . But in Bethlehem things like that are always happening . Some people say it has something to do with the drinking water . " " Have you been intriguing with him ? " said Saul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no , my Lord , I have not seen or heard from him since , " I avowed honestly . " He did not tell me when or how it would come about that I would be king . I have done no plotting . I have sought only to serve thee since the day of my killing of Goliath . " " Goliath ? " Saul looked at me inquisitively . " The Philistine giant , " I reminded him . It was beginning to irk me that nobody but me seemed to be talking anymore about my killing the terrifying warrior that day with just my sling . " What Philistine giant ? " asked Saul . " The one that I slew with my sling that day in the valley of Elah . You took me into your service then , and I have put my life in thy hand to slay the Philistine and preserve thee ever since . Do n't you remember ? " " For my own life I care not , " Saul said without answering me . " After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dies this year is quit for the next . But for you to follow me as king would require that Jonathan and my other sons go down to the grave with me too . My line and my name would be cut off among my brethren . " " My lord , I pray thee , let there be no strife ever between thee and me , " I implored him . " Do you believe I could ever wish evil to thy son Jonathan , whose soul is knit with my soul , and who goes about saying that he loves me as his own soul ? " " Yes , I 've heard him . " Saul studied me , squinting a bit , and demanded , " What does he mean by that ? " " That we 're good friends , " I hastened to say . " Just that ? " " Only that . " " Then why does n't he put it that way ? " Saul mumbled . " He tends to be poetic sometimes , my lord , " I explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hate poetry . But I like your music . " " I like to sing for you , " I confessed with feeling . " And I swear I will never lift a weapon against you or any of your house . And that I will serve Jonathan after you . " I meant it too . Saul sighed . " Let there be peace then forever between thee and me , " he offered . It was then that he embraced me , clasping inc warmly to his great chest with a tender and suffusing affection . " You have my sacred ... . J 1 ... : 11 l .... 1. ? -1 rw .. l. 6 ... 1 .. rhww h t ) nvi.t ? u II  | you come play for me again soon , perhaps the next time I 'm feeling blue ? " " But give me the chance ! " I promised gladly . " I long for nothing more . " I could not have guessed that he would oblige me so quickly . The very next day it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he sat in his house , and I was sent for still one more time to soothe and lighten with song and harp his grievously troubled heart . I came with an armful of music , intending to entertain him  --  for hours , if necessary  --  first with my " Ave Maria " and Moonlight Sonata and next with the premiere of my Goldberg Variations , a work I had recently composed for a neighbor of mine in Gibeah with insomnia on the gamble that the charming air on which the whole is based would lull him toward sleep more easily . This time Saul was awaiting me eagerly , cross-legged on a bench with a javelin already in his lap . That should , I suppose , have alerted me . I was too enthusiastic to care . He looked just awful again , I was glad to see . The worse his condition , the greater his need for me and the richer the opportunity to ingratiate myself with him and to convince him still further of my patriotic devotion . I was glad I had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had oiled my arms and face and pomaded my curls . With the second joints of my fingers I had rubbed my cheeks with vigor to enrich their natural color . I should have stood in bed . All of my preparations were wasted . No sooner did I lift my head to pose like an angel and part my lips for my first dulcet note than he rose from his bench and let fly at me with the javelin , seeking again to smite me even to the wall with it . Holy shit , I thought with terror . Again I was stupefied . Again he missed me by inches , the weapon embedding itself in the wood behind me with a loud report . This time , though , I made up my mind at once . Fuck him , I decided , and leaped to my feet . Enough is enough ! Music he wants ? Balls he 'll get ! I ducked my head and bounded away .  | At Nob I told some lies and eighty-five priests were slain . Not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in their households , and all of the livestock in that sacred city , were put to death as well . Who is to blame ? Saul , Doeg the Edomite , or old Ahimelech , the gullible reigning priest I hoodwinked into supplying me ? Saul , who originated the orders for the massacre , was already infamous as a rampaging , bloodthirsty lunatic . Doeg the Edomite , chiefest herdsman of Saul , did the butchering , after every one of the servants of the king , even Abner , refused to put forth his hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord . Ahimelech , officiating that day at the horns of the altar , was methodical and credulous in the performance of his functions and had no obligation to suppose he was being cozened into providing succor to a fugitive from the king 's wrath . Doeg the Edomite was most to blame , by my way of thinking ; he was doing his duty in the hope of advancement , and he that maketh haste to be rich can not be innocent . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime of observing others ? Me ? Where do I come in for any of the guilt ? How can anyone reasonable assert that the responsibility should be mine ? I was running for my life and had never , not once , done anything wrong . And even Ahimelech 's son Abiathar , sole survivor from Nob after Saul smote with the edge of the sword both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen , and asses , and sheep , even Abiathar laid none of the fault at my door and fled after me for protection when I had gathered some men about me and come farther up into Judah from the quarters I had established in the cave of Adullam . Inadvertently , I had occasioned the death of all the persons in his father 's house ; yet Abiathar sought refuge with me . He brought news of the slaughter with him . I took him in and vowed to safeguard him . And Abiathar has abided with me as priest ever since , even though Bathsheba pretends not to remember who he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , or derogates him as one who has lost his wits and is not to be taken seriously . " You should help a father in his age , " I tried moralizing with Bathsheba one time . " If his understanding fail , have patience with him . " " You 've got one foot in the grave , " was her unmoved retort . " It 's all I can do to keep patience with you . "  | Of Ahimelech that day , all I asked was a sword and some victuals . I wanted bread and saw five newly baked loaves . He was rightfully afraid at seeing me in Nob . " Why art thou alone ? " he wished to know . I falsely replied that the king had commanded me out on a business with orders to let no man know where or why I was going , and that I was to rendezvous in stealth with the others assigned to my party at such and such a place already appointed ; we wanted no questions raised about my coming and my going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I grew greatly concerned for myself when I recognized Doeg the Edomite skulking about in the small crowd attracted by my arrival . I knew he would acquaint Saul with the direction I had traveled when he arrived back in Gibeah and learned I was sought for execution , but I did not envision the awful consequences his report would produce . Nor can I convince myself that I would have acted any differently if I had given thought to what could result , or even that I should have . I was a young man in panic . I had committed no sin . I was above reproach and felt I had as much right to live as everyone else . In earshot of all , I requested of Ahimelech the sword or the spear I said I needed to conduct my action , stating that the king 's business required haste and that Saul had commissioned me to requisition a weapon from him . I also asked for the five loaves of bread I counted under his hand , still steaming and aromatic from the fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spare . Even before I finished , he was shaking his head . " There is no bread here to give you , " he told me apologetically , " but the shewbread . " " What 's shewbread ? " I asked . " This is no common bread under my hand , " Ahimelech the priest explained , " but there is hallowed bread I can give thee , if the young men with thee have kept themselves from women for at least these three days past and are not unclean . " " For more than three days , " I assured him with celerity , anxious to be gone before the curiosity of Doeg the Edomite was fanned into expressing some kind of doubt . " We are as clean as can be . " Only in this last statement was there anything like truth , for I had not lain with another woman since parting from Michal at my window three weeks earlier , nor had I lain with her more than once in the weeks preceding that . Our farewells had been rushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room after his newest effort to smitc me ,  | I had bolted first into Abner , who listened without arching an eyebrow to what for me was an account of a most extraordinary and hair-raising event . Abner bit into a pomegranate he was eating and continued grinding away noisily on the seeds as I spoke . " I myself would not make too much of it , " he decided a few seconds after I had finished . " Accidents will happen . " " Accidents ? " Could I believe my ears ? " Is it not an accident that your anointed king wishes to kill you every now and then ? " Abner argued in his friendly and sophistic way . " Or do you feel he has good cause ? " " He has no cause , " I declared emphatically . " And he still has n't hurt you , has he ? Be reasonable , David , " Abner added , as though urging me to grow up . " Life is to be lived . If it makes him fees better to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Saul is our king . He seems to perk up afterward . He lets off steam . " " You call that fair ? " " Is the moon made of cheese ? " Had I taste for such drollery at a time like that ? It was good Joab murdered Abner for me , although I did not think so at the time and had to simulate much public grief at his burial . It was good in the long run that he killed Absalom for me too , I guess , although I will never get over my love for that handsome second son of mine . He murdered my other nephew , Amasa , too , the son of my second sister , after we had put down Absalom 's rebellion , but Amasa hardly mattered , except to remind me again that Joab could be ruthless and disobedient in his jealousy of sharing power . I prepared Benaiah for Joab 's potential for enmity when I placed him rather than Joab in charge of the palace guard of Cherethite and Pelethite mercenaries I had created for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a blow that was to Joab . He was an idiot to suppose I would have put myself entirely at his mercy . Michal saved me that day Saul tried to smite me in his room . From Abner I headed home as fast as my legs would carry me and was a bundle of nerves by nightfall when Michal arrived . Like an animal encaged , I paced without letup from one section of our house to the other , vacillating between spasms of furious outrage and spells of tearful self-pity . I wanted to howl and I wanted to whimper . Part of the turmoil I suffered sprang from my need to find some way of protesting to Michal about her father without provoking from her another angry outburst against me . My misgivings were unnecessary , for she was in a very had state herself when she finally camc bursting in.  | " You 'll never believe it ! " we shouted at each other at exactly the same moment , and for the next half minute or so communicated with each other in a flurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I cried indignantly . " I 'm not going to stand for it . You 're not going to believe me . " " It 's awful , awful , " she was telling me even as I was protesting to her . " The news I 've got for you is awful . I ca n't believe such awful news . " " He threw a javelin at me again . " " Murderers are coming . " " I knew you would n't believe me , " I accused . " Never mind what I believe , " she retorted . " What I 'm telling you is worse . " " You never believe me when it comes to your father . He threw a javelin . What could be worse ? " " Murderers outside , that could be worse , " answered Michal . " Murderers ? What are you talking about ? " " They 're on the way . " " Yeah-yeah . " " You do n't believe me ? Assassins , David , " she emphasized in my face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Oy , they 're already here , in the street outside , to watch the house through the night and slay you when you leave in the morning . " " I know you 're joking . " " Go look . " " Holy shit ! " Furtive hooded men with cloaks and daggers were already positioning themselves in doorways and alleys in the street in front of my house and at both ends , shutting off flight and closing me in . Their dark robes were of solid colors and the blades and handles of their swords and daggers could be seen jutting from beneath . Some were waiting with their hands already on the hilt . Michal was breathing deeply . " What can we do ? " " I think I know exactly what to do , " I replied with authority . " They would not dare detain or harm you , the daughter of the king . You go out now , go to the house of your father the king as quickly as you can , and report to your father the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess who sent them . " I was now able to discern , in shadowy profile in a recess between two houses , the vulpine silhouette of Abner and one of his pomegranates . Abner always did have a very big nose . Prompted by Michal , I was able to put two and two together and sec that she was right .  | " Michal , what can we do ? " I whispered . " What does it all mean ? " " It means that if thou save not thy life tonight , " was the sage counsel she gave me , " tomorrow thou shalt be slain . " It was Michal who concocted most of the elements in the scheme that allowed me to save my skin and who took upon herself most of the burden of implementing them : we laid an image in the bed with a pillow of goat 's hair for a bolster and covered it with a blanket , to represent me sleeping ; she let me down by a rope through a rear window ; in the morning , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messengers from Saul came inquiring about my failure to appear from my house as usual . By that time I would be far off , and the lie and the ruse would give me hours more . It was Michal too who , sooner or later , would have to face the music when the deception inevitably was exposed , and justify herself against the ire of her father with the precarious excuse that I had threatened I would kill her . To the questions of why , if she had indeed been in such fear of me , she had not raised a hue and cry the instant I was departed , or had not thrown herself under the protection of the messengers from her father instead of delaying them with fabrications , she could give whatever lame explanation came to mind . Or she could weep or faint . Or both . We put together a shepherd 's ration of bread , cheese , dates , olives , and raisins , along with a water bag and another bag of curdled goat 's milk . And some fig cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I love you , " she said in a clipped voice . " I hope you know that . " I could see that she did , but in the only way she knew how , with acrimony , injury , envy , and disdain , and with consummate selfishness and egocentricity . We kissed goodbye on the sill of the window . " Do you have your mouthwash ? " I lied and said yes . And out the window I went , like some hairylegged clown in a dirty burlesque . When next we met , I had been king in Hebron for over seven years and she had been given by her father to another man as wife . And neither one of us was that much fond of the other . It 's a wonder to me still that I landed on my feet and escaped in one piece . I headed directly for Ramah to the abode of Samuel , seeking shelter , solace , and wisdom from the one man left in the kingdom who I thought might still have influence over Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf . It was a waste of energy . What I found instead was a man with frantic woes commensurate with my own who was vexed with me for having added to his . " What do you want ? " was the irascible way he greeted me . " Why  | With his shaggy hands he was rapidly throwing things into his knapsack , and he seemed to be grumbling in his beard while I did my best to explain . Samuel was just about the crankiest individual I had ever met , and I have not come upon any since to rival him . He was even hairier than I remembered him : his endless black beard , profusely lined now with wiry strands of dingy gray , was , it embarrasses me to reveal , a bit unkempt . " From me you want wisdom ? " he demanded curtly . " From me you want influence and shelter ? Solace I should give you ? How should I be the one to tell you what to do ? " " You 're a prophet , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time you heard of me doing any of that ? " " You 're also a Judge . " " When was the last time you heard me judge anything ? Listen , even when I was speaking directly for the Lord I was n't always sure I was telling the truth . " " You can still give me advice , ca n't you ? " " You want advice ? " spoke Samuel . " I 'll give you a beautiful piece . Go far , far away . " " From where ? From whom ? " " From me , you damned fool , " Samuel sputtered . " Have n't I got troubles enough ? Now he 'll think I 've been helping you . You had to come here ? " " You had to start the whole thing ? " " Me ? What did I start ? I started nothing . " " Did I ask you to anoint me ? You came and said I 'd be king , did n't you ? " " You want to be king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be king somewhere else , and leave me alone . I 've got to run now  --  thanks to you . " " To where ? " " Naioth . You think I 'm staying here , now that you showed up ? " Samuel was squeezing his hands and chanting distractedly . " Look at me , look at me , " he grieved . " A Judge , a prophet , yet . I used to be the most powerful man in the country until God told me to turn away from Saul and go to you . Why did I have to listen to Him ? " " Why did you have to make Saul king ? " " I made Saul king ? " Samuel shook his head vehemently . " Oh , no , sir , mister . Not me . God made Saul king . I just delivered the message . None of it was my idea . It was the people who wanted a king , not me . They were n't satisfied with just me , with just a Judge . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" " You made no mistake ? " " God makes mistakes , not Judges . You want the truth ? If it was up to me , I would have chosen your brother Eliab , or Abinadab , or even Shammah  --  they 're bigger than you . And they were born first . But the Lord told me to look not on the outward appearance or the countenance . The Lord looketh on the heart , He told me . Sure  --  the heart , He told me . And He saw something special in yours . What it is I can not guess . Do me a favor and give me a clue . " " A lot of good He 's done me , " I sulked . " I ca n't even go back to Bethlehem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Here is the first place he 'll look when he learns you did n't go back into Judah , " Samuel reproved me bitterly . The only prophecy Samuel would make was that Saul would go wild when he heard I 'd come to Ramah to him . " That 's why I 'm going to Naioth , fast . " " Naioth ? " I complained some more . " There 's nothing to do in Naioth . Now I have to run to Naioth with you . " " With me ? " Samuel 's words were a cry of alarm . " Oh , no , mister , not with me . Run somewhere else and leave me alone . I know trouble when I see it . Goodbye , goodbye , parting is such sweet sorrow , but not from you . " I let him know I was sticking to him like glue . Where else could I go ? How we squabbled from the beginning ! He insisted on taking his cow . " She brings me good luck , " he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected . " Who tells you to wait ? " he wanted to know . " And why go to Naioth ? " " Who asks you to come ? " If consolation was my goal , I was not going to obtain it from him . Samuel was accurate in his prediction about Saul , who lost no time sending messengers to Naioth to take me once it was told him where his bird had flown . His men never got there ; strangely , they fell to prophesy " ing along the way . When that same thing came to pass with a second contingent , Saul set out to take me himself . Then the unforeseen occurred again . You would n't believe what happened . I had given up . Samuel and his cow would go no farther . Just as I was practically in his grasp , Saul was irresistibly possessed for the second time in his life with the need to prophesy . It began at a great well in Sechu , where he learned by inquiring that we were still in Naioth . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | befallen the men he had sent earlier to seize me , the spirit of God was upon him also , just like that , and he began to prophesy . And he went on and on and prophesied all the way into Naioth until he came to Samuel , and guess what he did then ? He stripped off his clothes also , and prophesied before Samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all the rest of that day and , as it turned out , all that night . Wherefore , it could again be seen and said that Saul also was among the prophets . This time , though , I saw it with my own eyes . " It 's a miracle , " I said in a hushed voice when Samuel and I were again by ourselves . " Do n't bet on it . " We spoke on the ground by torchlight . He was sweating from exhaustion . " At least now I have a little room to breathe . " " How long will it last ? " " He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then maybe , if we 're lucky , he 'll go back home to pull himself together , until something else comes up to make him crazy again . What more can I tell you ? Saul is miserable , murderous , and unstable . Saul is the unhappiest person I know  --  except , maybe , for me . " " Samuel , " I proposed , with the germ of an idea stirring , " you can help him , you can help all of us . Let Saul be king again . " " Let Saul be king again ? " Samuel echoed with disdain . " How can Saul be king again ? You 're the king . " " Does Saul know that ? " " Why do you think he wants to kill you ? Why do you question me ? " " Why do I question you ? " I repeated , amazed . The scruffy old goat was totally without imagination . " Because I 'm living in a fucking ditch , that 's why . I have no home in Gibeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every Monday and Thursday I find myself dodging javelins from Saul . You call this being king ? What the hell good is it ? " " You 'll be king , you 'll be king , " Samuel muttered without conviction . " Why worry , what 's your hurry ? Bide your time . Rome was n't built in a day . " " From a Judge like you I do n't need banalities like that , " I let him know . " Saul is mad . " " You 're telling me ? Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad . " " A lot of good that does me . I 'm tired of waiting . I live like a bum . " " What 's the big rush ? It 's the mills of the gods . " " What about them ? " " The mills of the gods grind slowly , " he told mc , " yet they grind erreelinoly fine "  | " And what am I supposed to do while they 're grinding ? " Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I care what you do ? " he shouted . " Bang your head against the wall . Go shit in the ocean . You can grow like an onion with your head in the ground and your feet in the air , for all I care . " We each spent a minute calming down . With long-nailed yellow fingers , Samuel peevishly picked bits of food , foliage , and other refuse from the dangling knots of hair falling down on his shoulders and his chest . I gave him a drink from my bag of water and he thanked me grumpily . I gave him pistachio nuts . " Samuel , Samuel , " I implored diplomatically . " Let us try to reason together . " " I used to be the most powerful man in the country , " he reminisced again . " I should have stuck with Saul , no matter what I thought God said He wanted . " " Then let Saul be king again , " I advised , " at least until the mills of the gods finish grinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It is n't true , " Samuel answered . " Does he have to know ? Let him think he 's king . Ask God if it 's all right . " Unintentionally , I had touched another nerve ; Samuel looked hurt for a second but answered gently . " Do n't you think I 've done that ? You think I 'm dumb or something ? Of course I asked God . " " Did God say yes ? " " He did n't say no , " Samuel retorted , and then went on more candidly . " He did n't say anything . God answereth me no more , " he confessed , in a voice weak with humiliation . " Not you either ? " I exclaimed . " Saul told me the same thing about himself . What the devil is wrong with God these days ? " Samuel shrugged . " Do I know ? " " Maybe , " I hypothesized , venturing forth again into the same uncharted intellectual territory which I had once started incautiously to explore with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply was terse . " God can be dead ? " " God ca n't be dead ? " " If He 's God , He ca n't be dead , stupid , " Samuel instructed me . " If I ie 's dead , He ca n't be God . It 's someone else . Enough of your foolishness . " " ' Then let 's ask I Ii1n again , " I proposed eagerly . " " They say He likes me . Come on , Samuel . Try another sacrifice . "  | " Then do it without the sacrifice , " I persisted . " It does n't hurt to ask , does it ? See if Saul can be king . " " King-schming , " Samuel intoned . I found his message incomprehensible . " I do n't think I understand that . " " It 's a saying . " " An old saying ? " My question irritated him . " How old can it be , you dummy ? Is n't Saul our first king ? Listen , you think I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . You think we have no feeling for Saul , God and me ? No love ? We pity him , repent for him , feel mercy toward him . God even chastised me once for mourning for Saul too long . That was just before He ordered me to fill my horn with oil and go find you . What a sad day that was . You 've no idea how I hate the sight of you . I was much better off with Saul . All Saul did was disobey me once . I 'm sorry I lost my temper and said those mean things to him . " " Then go back to him and apologize , " I advised , nobly allowing his gratuitously insulting comments to pass without objection . " Tell him you made a mistake . " Samuel drew himself up frigidly . " I should tell him I made a mistake ? " " Then tell him God did . " " That 's more like it , " Samuel agreed . " Saul would believe that . But the Lord is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you can do it all on your own , " I coaxed . " Tell Saul you decided to give him another chance . You told me he 's miserable . Let him feel good again for a while . " Samuel spoke with wicked relish . " Let him twist slowly , " he said , his eyes smoldering , " slowly in the wind . " For the moment I was speechless . " I thought you loved Saul , " I finally exclaimed . " You said that you and God had pity and compassion for him and that you wanted to be merciful toward him . " " That 's the way we show it . " Samuel went back to Ramah , where it was his good fortune to die before Saul got around to killing him too after slaughtering the priests at Nob and discovering through trial and error that people in high position get away with murder . I IKE A DOG returning to its vomit , or a fool repeating his folly , I J found myself journeying back to Gibeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be awaiting me there in the streets . I walked on high winding paths deserted after dark . skirtinu the main ways  | through the villages in between , lest there be a lion in the streets of one of those too . I moped all the way . I came back toward Saul as though hypnotized , drawn by my wistful need to re-establish myself in the good graces of the man on earth who had made a deeper impression on me than any other  --  even though I now understood him to be mad and homicidal and even , perhaps , stupid and boring . I felt he was my father , my patron still , and I wanted to be near him no matter what . Believe it or not , I even wanted to be back with Michal . He was the only being I had ever succeeded in loving as a parent ; his , for better or for worse , was the only house in which I had ever felt myself at home . Had Saul been just a bit more fatherly to Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had God ever been the least hit paternal , I might have loved Him like a father . Even when God has been good to me it has not been with much kindness . At the same time , I will admit that the notion of my succeeding Saul as king had never been entirely obnoxious to me or out of my daydreams for long . My head told me that this final endeavor to reinstate myself with Saul would prove hopeless . My heart told me I was exiled forever from the only nest in which I could ever dwell without feeling myself estranged and adrift , disconnected from my own past , and with no strong sense of attachment to my future . I was nevertheless compelled to try , despite my foreknowledge of futility , which weighed in my breast like an anvil . I was much less stiff-necked with Saul than I have been with God . I knew he was crazy ; yet I wanted to win his devotion and forgiveness . I would want to try again even now if he were still alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Entering Gibeah after sundown , I conferred with Jonathan in secrecy , wretchedly craving to glean from him , the king 's oldest son , even the dimmest ray of hope . What I obtained instead was a befuddling surprise . " Jonathan , please help me , " I begged at the beginning , trusting no one fully , not even him . We conversed in a wooded corner of that same oblong field of moldering stalks of scythed wheat in which Saul and I had talked so familiarly on that magical moonlit night . Again the balmy air blowing in from the distant sea was caressing in texture and laden with the intoxicating fragrances of plums and melons and of blue grapes in the winepresses . " You can talk to him again for me . Observe him closely at dinner tomorrow night . Find out if he has forgiven me or if he still means to kill inc . Then come and tell inc. , , " You can observe him ourself , " was the answer with which Jonathan r:ntttht me unnrenarcd . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane ! " I cried , suspecting a trick . It was that time of month again when the moon was new , and I learned from Jonathan that I was expected to sit with the king at meat in the evening as in normal times , positively without fail . What kind of nonsense was that , I wanted to know . I was highly indignant . Was n't I a fugitive ? It was as though nothing at all untoward had occurred , as though Saul had not tried to smite me even to the wall with his javelin , sent minions to my house to slay me , ordered messengers to Naioth to seize me , and even come after me himself for the pleasure of apprehending me and ordering my death on the spot . What the hell was going on ? Was all of that forgotten , did it count for nothing ? Apparently yes , for a place would be set for me at the king 's table the night following , and my failure to appear would be judged insubordinate . I felt myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there ? With a logic that appeared irrefutable to him , Jonathan proposed that inasmuch as the king was not then pursuing me , I had no good reason to avoid him and was without legitimate cause for flight or truancy . I was n't buying it . " They commissioned you to bring me ? " " There was no talk of that , " answered Jonathan . " But as long as you 're here , you can come tomorrow . You will come with me . " They all must be crazy . " Why shouldest thou bring me to thy father ? " I pleaded with Jonathan . " I know he still means to slay me . " " I ca n't believe that . " " Then you find out for me . What have I done ? You ask him . What is mine iniquity , and what is my sin that he seeketh my life ? " Jonathan was disposed toward a rosier view . " Behold , my father will do nothing either great or small , but that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing from me ? " " Jonathan , your father is n't that wild about you , remember ? " I answered . " Thy father certainly knoweth by now that I have found grace in thy eyes . You go about telling that to everybody . Perhaps he does not want you to grieve , or is afraid you might talk secretly with me , as we are doing now . What made him think I would even be back here after all that has taken place ? He sent murderers to my house to kill me . " " I ca n't believe that . " " Ask your sister . " " Michal exaggerates . The moon will be new . " " Does he think I 'd come back to have dinner with him just because the moon is new ? " " You know how crazy he is , " Jonathan tried to explain . " He forgives and forgets . "  | " And then he forgets he 's forgiven , " I replied . " As the Lord liveth , Jonathan , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and death . I feel it in my bones . " Jonathan looked horrified and said unto me , " God forbid  --  thou shalt not die . Whatsoever thy soul desireth , I will even do it for thee . " " Then let me go , " I suggested , " that I may hide myself in the field at least unto the third evenii.g and the morning after . You watch and see if thy father at all misses me . If he does , then say that I asked leave of thee to run to my city of Bethlehem for the yearly sacrifice there for all my family . If he says that it is well and that I shall have peace , I will return to him that same day . But if he be very wroth , then we can be sure that evil is determined by him . Who shall tell me if thy father answer thee roughly ? " " Would not I tell thee ? " earnestly responded Jonathan , who 'd been bobbing his head with assent all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee as I do my own soul ? " I had no doubt Jonathan did love me as he did his own soul , although I was n't sure what that meant . And I did believe he would do everything feasible to insure my safety . " Tomorrow is a new moon , " he began rapidly , outlining a plan of his own , " and thou shalt be missed , we know , because thy seat will be empty . Do n't come to my house . Do n't even come into the city . " " A lion is in the streets ? " " For you , it may indeed turn out that a lion is in the streets . Abide thou three days in the field in one place or the other . Then thou shalt go down quickly every morning and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel until the morning I shalt have word for thee and appear . " " Ezel ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof , as though I shot at a mark . And behold , I will send a lad , saying , Go find out the arrows . ' Now , if I expressly say unto the lad , Behold , the arrows are on this side of thee , take them , ' then come thou , for there is peace in thee , and no hurt , as the Lord liveth . But if I say thus unto the young man , Behold , the arrows are beyond thee , ' go thy way , for the Lord hath sent thee away . " " Say that all again ? " I requested , my mind starting to reel . " Please do it my way , " Jonathan asked . He was still struggling for breath and I did not have the heart to oppose him . " Behold , if there be good toward David when I have sounded my father and I then not send unto thee , the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , then I will show it thee and send thee away , that thou mavest uo in mace. "  | " I 'm not sure I have that one straight either . " " Let 's just see what happens with my father at dinner the first night and the second night and the third . I worry so about him when the moon is new . " Jonathan came on the last day at the appointed time . For the third morning in succession , I arose stiffly from another night of fitful sleep , with dead insects drying on my mouth and the rustle of a small animal scratching on fallen leaves nearby . I concealed myself as bidden near the stone Ezel , after I had relieved myself in a patch of stubby brown weeds deep inside the stand of green laurel in which I had cleared my lonely nocturnal burrow . A little lad was with Jonathan . I held my breath to hear better . And Jonathan said unto his lad , in a voice meant to carry , " Run , find out now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeked out in suspense , I saw the lad run , and I saw Jonathan shoot an arrow far over his head , and I heard Jonathan cry after the lad , and say , " Is not the arrow beyond thee ? " I felt my strength fail with the long trajectory of the arrow . Jonathan was one of the very few among us then who had learned how to use a bow . The look of leaden sorrow on his countenance confirmed my grim conviction that my fate had now been sealed beyond any chance of reprieve . I wanted to cry . Jonathan shot two more . A weird and awkward interval occurred after Jonathan 's lad had gathered up the arrows and come back to his master . Jonathan looked about in all directions confusedly . We had both forgotten the remainder of the code . Everything came to a clumsy standstill . Giving up , Jonathan handed all his artillery unto his lad and instructed him , " Go carry them into the city . " And Jonathan cried after the lad , " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew not anything . And as soon as he was gone , I arose out of my place toward the south , feeling terrible , just terrible , and I fell on my face to the ground when I reached Jonathan and bowed three times . I knew it was the end , that all hope of effecting the longed-for reunion with his father was over . Jonathan 's eyes too were filling with tears when he helped me up , and I could read in his forlorn and agitated look the unmistakable message of my failure and doom . It was then , and only then , that we fell into each other 's arms and hugged , that we kissed one another and wept one with the other , until I exceeded him in weeping , and that was the only time . And that 's all that we did . Show me proof there was ever more . Jonathan was voluble with details as he sounded my death knell . On the first day of the new moon , which was the first day of the month by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as at other times , Abner sat by his side . and my place was empty . Saul 's Qlance fixed itself continually  | upon my empty place that first evening as though he were staring at some baleful omen , but he raised not a question to anyone about my absence . Instead , he murmured aloud that something surely must have befallen me to account for my empty place ; perhaps I was unclean , surely that was it , I was not clean . Perhaps I had even lain with my wife . It was a different story on the following day when he saw my place empty again . This time he inquired point-blank of Jonathan why I had not come to meat neither that day nor the day previous . His anger was kindled against Jonathan when he heard the reply I had devised , that I had sought Jonathan out for leave to go to my family to sacrifice in Bethlehem and that Jonathan had given it . And Saul flew into a fury at the knowledge that Jonathan and I had met and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What followed was somewhat chaotic . He commanded Jonathan to fetch me unto him forthwith to be slain , cast a javelin at him when Jonathan spoke up in my defense , and then excoriated him in a rambling , incoherent diatribe denouncing his allegiance , his intelligence , and even , incongruously , his maternal parenthood , whereby Jonathan at last knew that it was determined of his father to slay me . " There was more , David , much more , " Jonathan went on , with his stricken look . " He called me an imbecile too , practically . Then he told me I was the son of a perverse , rebellious woman , and that I had chosen to side with you to my own confusion . Half the time I did not know what he was talking about . He added something else that makes no sense to me at all . David , you 're smart , maybe you can figure it out . He told me also  --  this is not easy to say  --  that I was a confusion to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's nakedness ? " " Do you know what that means ? " " A confusion to your mother 's nakedness ? " I repeated a second time , to make sure I had heard him aright . " That 's exactly it , " Jonathan affirmed . " He told me I had chosen you to my own confusion and unto the confusion of my mother 's nakedness . It kept me awake all night . " " What did he mean by that ? " " I asked you . " " It 's Greek to me , " I was forced to confess . " Jonathan , there 's something more that 's troubling you . I can tell it by your eyes . " " I le also said , " Jonathan revealed with great difficulty , glancing away , " that neither I nor my kingdom would be established as long as the son of Jesse was allowed to remain alive on the ground . " h . X1 ... : 1- 1 .. ? .. 11 . ) ' 1 ' 1 .. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe him ? " He was truthful . " I do n't know . " I had no weapon . My death had been sanctioned . He could again be a hero . He wore his short sword in a scabbard and a knife in his girdle . He was older than I and much the larger and stronger , and I knew he could have seized me by the hair in his grip and stabbed or slashed me or run me through , as he desired . And I also knew by the look of him that if I had asked him for his sword and his knife , he would have lain both in my hand without question . We wept again , meet as friends one more time before his death , when he sought me out in my hiding place in the wilderness of Ziph to confide that he too now was sure I would be king over Israel soon and to pledge that he would sit next to me loyally . We made a covenant on that before the Lord , and Jonathan stole back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left unmentioned , was the underlying knowledge that his oath , though earnest , was more sentimental than practical , for Jonathan would certainly have to be dead before my accession to kingship could come about . We shook hands on it anyway . We made covenant after covenant also at the tearful leave-taking in the field earlier , pledging eternal amity between him and me , and between his seed and my seed forever , for all that was worth . I know I did look after his only son , who was lamed on both his feet after a panicking nurse dropped him while trying to flee after hearing the news of the great Philistine victory at Gilboa and of the death of Saul and Jonathan both . And again when we wept , Jonathan and I , I exceeded him . I 'll admit I exceeded him . Why would n't I exceed him ? God only knows what he was weeping about . I was crying because I had lost everything and was shit out of luck . A poor man , you may find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe it . I 've been both . I 've even been both at the same time , and it 's much better to lie than to be poor . Ask anyone rich , if you do n't believe that . After we separated , Jonathan could , as he did when he arose and departed , go back into the city to his house . But what about me ? The foxes have their holes , and the birds of the air have their nests , but this son of man , of Jesse the Bethlehemite , had nowhere to lay his head . I could not go home again . Bethlehem in Judah would be the first place Saul would look ; and as sure as the night follows day , he would soon have his messengers out scouring the whole country for word of my whereabouts hrs. h nom I . kn . . I.n. .1 ... I I 1 I  | and that I would succeed him as king if I were permitted to live . His wrath was cruel and his anger outrageous ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not depend much on the kindness of strangers , and certainly not of friends and relations . A rich man beginning to fall is held up by his friends , but a poor man being down is thrust away quickly by everyone , by his friends also . Wealth makes many friends , of course , but the poor is separated from his neighbor , and if all the brethren of the poor do hate him , how much more do his friends go far from him ? Besides , what friends could I go to ? Joab ? Abishai ? Who can number the sand of the sea , and the drops of rain , and the days of eternity ? All of this , though commonplace now and wryly humorous , I found out directly through rigorous personal experience in the months that followed . Not until I was thrown out of Gath by . the Philistines and came to rest at last in my hiding place in the cave of Adullam did I find some surcease from sorrow . From gross and gluttonous Nabal in Carmel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud hate humility , so do the rich abhor the poor . No wonder I grew wise so soon . I was striding with my band to avenge with blood Nabal 's demeaning rebuff when Abigail intercepted us with her string of asses bearing the provisions I politely had solicited , and she made humble apology for the arrogant rudeness of her fat husband . Nabal died with relief when he heard how narrowly he had escaped being slain , and I wound up with his wife and a good-sized share of his transportable belongings . But in between , I could scarcely draw a peaceful breath or enjoy a good night 's sleep . I was anathema to anyone who knew me , an outcast hated by the brutal king , a danger to anyone I approached , an accursed stranger in a strange land who could not without mortal risk to everyone in the vicinity walk up to anyone I beheld with the simple plea " Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink , for I am thirsty . " Anyone aiding me even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own life in peril . Look what happened to Ahimelech and the other priests from Nob , and to their families . So it was to foil expectations and evade capture that , instead of returning south into Judah , I hastened in the opposite direction to the city of Nob for my sword and my breads , told my lies , and left such barbarous and unimaginable destruction in my wake . Noting Doeg the Edomite in Nob brought home to me the desperate seriousness of my plight : my time of free travel in Israel was going to be short . I pretended not to recognize him , but arose as soon as I had rested and I fled that same day for fear of Saul . Anv kind of deal we might have struck in those circumstances would  | have been of little value , for the heart is deceitful in all things . Do n't I know that from my own bouts of self-examination ? The unexamined life is not worth living , I know . The examined life is ? There 's just no escaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the acts for which Saul held me at fault , I was nonetheless guilty of all . In Saul 's fevered imagination I wanted his kingdom and his life . Whereas all I really aimed for most days now was a basin of clean water in which to wash my feet and a hot bowl of lentil soup . Many 's the time I would have traded my birthright for a mess of pottage . The fool walks in darkness , but what choice did I have ? I reversed my course and headed south . As much as I could , I traveled by night , knowing it was a far , far better thing I was doing skirting the familiar resting places of my native Judah and fleeing downward into the land of the Philistines than I had ever done before . I snatched sleep in wadis for an hour at a time when the weather was dry . In storms I took refuge in limestone caves , listening to the rain lashing down outside in windswept gusts and cropping away like deadly locusts at the soft sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day after the next , glowworms and gecko lizards were the most agreeable of my companions . There was hail , and fire mingled with the hail . Take it from me , the king 's wrath is as the roaring of a lion , and Saul 's wrath had transmogrified me into a fugitive and a vagabond and had caused me to stink among the inhabitants . You think I was used to living that way ? The whole thing was a desolation and an astonishment to me , as though suddenly the earth was again without form , and void , and darkness was upon the face of the deep . I avoided the company of humans . How I remembered and missed the voice of mirth , the sound of the millstones , the light of the candle . I traveled invisibly through tangled thickets of brier on high ground when I did move by day , and crept along paths at night through villages and small towns only when the streets were empty . I stole food , gathered wine and summer fruits from the cellars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggedly through stony hills , until Judah had been left behind me and the land of the Philistines lay before me like a sanctuary . I felt I had triumphed , although I had only lasted . I was still far from the coast , but I had made it to Gath . Twice in my long and rather eventful life , I fled to the city of King Achish of Gath for protection . The first time , he threw me out . The next , he welcomed me and my small army of six hundred with open arms , so to speak , and allocated to me his southern territory of Ziklag to oversee , police , and plunder. ' l'his was the first time . Believe mc , when sorrows  | come , they come not single spies , but in battalions . It never rains but it pours . I was spotted within minutes of walking into the first inn I saw after passing through the gates of the city . I do n't know why I was identified so quickly  --  we 're not allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't because I looked Jewish . I 've never looked that Jewish , and the patrons in the spacious rooms already included a colorful sprinkling of other Hebrews from various places , as well as some Hittites , Midianites , Canaanites , and other Semites . I was famous , I guess , and probably had been pointed out in the past to some of the Philistine fighting men present . I was , I will have to grant , already something of a legend in my own time . The last thing I wanted was more trouble , especially in Gath . What I needed most was a bath and a good meal . The catch of the day at the Philistine inn was water snake and baby eel . I had a beer and ordered some baked whitefish with prawns and kasha varnishkas , and a pork chop with potato pancakes to start . Before any of it could come , I began to grow uncomfortably aware of a stir of recognition developing beneath the normal hubbub of the place . I could see I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who pressed closer together and in upon me with a hunger for information . Was this not David , they wished to know , first from each other and then from me . Which David ? David who ? The David of whom they did used to sing one to another of him in dances , saying Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ? Was this not that David ? Like a schmuck , I said yes . Say what you will about the coarse aesthetic insensibilities of the Philistines ; they are of husky physique , and in no time at all they had me rolled up in a rug and delivered like a bolt of woolen cloth to the room in which King Achish of Gath sat in a monstrous oak chair he called a throne . Even as they were unrolling me from the filthy rug in which I had been bound , they began to reminisce , and horrible visions of Samson eyeless in Gaza began dancing in my brain as I listened . They talked of blinding me and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laid up these words in my heart and was sore afraid . I was not in a good bargaining position , and could see that in one way or another I would have to change my behavior . So on the spot I decided to put on an antic disposition and stake everything on the effect . Where do you think Shakespeare really got the idea for Hamlet ? I began with a song . " When there are gray skies , I do n't mind the gray skies , you make them blue , sonny boy , " I sang out without warning  | in the loudest , most melodramatic voice I could produce , riveting everyone in that great timbered hall with amazement . Philistine doctrine back then insisted that madness was contagious , and subsequent scientific studies have proved this primitive superstition largely correct . Following up my initial advantage of surprise , I pulled out all the stops . Plunging toward the flaggergasted monarch , I dropped to one knee , grasped his hand in one of mine , and spread my other over my chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened wide my jaws as though to go further with my song . Achish pulled back from me as though I were leprous . He bounded out of his throne with a yelp , and I followed as he retreated backward in horror . Poor Achish . I rolled my eyes about full circle in their sockets and regaled him with my very admirable imitation of a Jewish laughing hyena . In all ways I could think of I feigned myself mad in their hands . I scrabbled at the doors of the gate , making canine epileptic noises , and I let my spittle fall down all over my beard . Achish squealed and whimpered in panic each time I made a motion toward him with my arms outspread , as though I were ambitious to afflict him fatally with something catching . He glared wildly at the men who had brought me to him . " Lo , you see the man is mad ! " he berated them , screaming . " Wherefore then have you brought him to me ? I am king of Gath . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow to play the madman in my presence ? Shall this fellow come to my house ? Better he should bring me boils , palsy . Get him out , put him out quickly lest he cast his plague upon all our houses . " I did better than Hamlet with my madness . I saved my life . All he did was carry on precociously and divert attention from the fact that nothing much believable goes on in the play between the second act and the last . They drove me from the palace and out the gate of the city , beating and prodding me from a hygienic distance with long staves and with the hinder end of their spears . " Where shall I go ? " I bewailed them . " Saul seeks my life . " " Try Gaza , " one of them advised conspiratorially , " or even Askelon . But tell it not in Gaza that we put you out . And publish it not in the streets of Askelon . Maybe they will let you in . In Askelon , madmen do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaza or Askelon , but to wend my way back into the remote places of Judah and eventually to make my lair in the cave  | But that night I bedded down alone again , in another forsaken place , after I had walked dispiritedly as far from the city as I could go before I tired . I sat myself down on a fallen tree beside a small pool in a wood near the fork in the road . I hung my harp on a willow and wept when I remembered Gibeah , recalled my auspicious beginning and all of the good things in the offing that now seemed out of reach forever . I had never in my life been in lower mood than I was that evening . I wondered where in the world I could go . Adam out of Eden had a more coherent sense of direction than I did and was much better off . With fresh water from the pond , I washed the spittle from my beard with my bare hands and wiped my face with the sleeve of my dirty cloak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stupid statue of Michelangelo 's in Florence that 's supposed to be me : he 's got me beardless , clean-shaven , without a hair on my face  --  and not only that , he 's got me standing there in public stark naked , with that uncircumcised prick ! If that Michelangelo Buonarroti had possessed even the dimmest idea of how we Jews felt about nudity then , he never would have put me up there on that pedestal out in the open with my schlong hanging down , and with that homely , funny foreskin no self-respecting Jew would let himself be caught dead with . We 're not even allowed to go up by steps to the altar , that our nakedness be not discovered thereon . Besides , I was already much too busy when I was that age ; I never had time like his David did to stand around all day for centuries doing nothing , with just a sling on my shoulders and no clothes on , not even a loincloth to hide my nakedness , just waiting for something interesting to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taken all in all , but it just is n't me . And besides , if Bathsheba was telling me the truth , I have , or did have , a much bigger dick than he does , even without the funny foreskin . Foreskins are always so funny-looking I 'm surprised anyone keeps them . That 's the real reason we circumcise ; we like to look nice . There 's nothing mysterious about it . The statue of me by Donatello in Florence is even worse  --  a scandal , a sacrilege  --  but at least they 've got that one off the beaten track in the Bargello , where no one important ever goes . No , what we have from Michelangelo , I 'm afraid , is not David from Bethlehem in Judah but a Florentine fag 's idea of what a handsome Israelite youth might look like if he were a naked Greek catamite instead of the hardy , ruddy-faced shepherd boy who walked to Shochoh with a carriage of provisions for his three brothers that day and stayed to beat down the detestable boasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy thought crossing my mind that : .. L : . a , . a . i. .. : c .. 1 : .1 . , i r .... c. :  | ness . This was a hell of an unjust spot for the guy who had killed Goliath to find himself in ! Eventually , I slept , and my lashes were stuck together with tears I shed while I slumbered . When I awoke , my head was filled with dew and my locks with the drops of the earth . At once I felt worse . Watching the morn in russet mantle clad creep o'er the hills , I felt my heart die within me as I realized suddenly that just about no one ever mentioned Goliath anymore , neither Philistine nor Israelite , and I began to wonder if the day of my killing him had ever really taken place .  | In the cave of Adullam in the outskirts of Judah above the plain of the Philistines , where I climbed by myself to hide out for a while after coming back up from Gath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was no fun at the start , and the improvement did not occur overnight . I slept on the ground in a worn cloak amid menacing black things changing shape in the darkness , and pondered the phenomenon that man that is born of a woman is of few days , and full of trouble . I watched fireflies for diversion . As knowledge of my lurking place leaked out and spread , people , to my surprise , began laboring their way up through the steep and barren rock-strewn hills to enlist in my service . They trudged in alone or in groups of two or three , some days faster than I could keep count , arriving to join up with me in an ever-swelling stream . And such people you would n't believe ! Riffraff . Scum . Ne'er-do-wells . Thugs and ruffians . Everyone that was in distress , and everyone that was in debt , and everyone that was discontented , all gathered themselves unto me , and I became a captain over them . It began to look as though every deadbeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious to throw in with me . I was soon posting sentinels to beat back all but the most formidable and battle-hardened . Those I let stay were durable , fearless , and experienced , for life as fugitive outlaws in the wildernesses of Judah through which we were soon set to roam is not for the timid or the weak or for people who , like all my sons , were spoiled by easy circumstances . Joab was one of the first to join up with me . He came for the adventure , bringing two more of my nephews , his brothers Abishai and Asahel , with him . The rest of my family sped to me for their lives . Fearing a bloodbath from Saul , all of my brethren and all of the others in my father 's house came down hither to me as fast as they could make it when they heard of the stronghold I was establishing in the holes in the walls of the caves of Adullam . Everything left behind was confiscated . I took them in , of course , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratified to observe with the passage of time , destined to lead obscure lives that brought them to the attention of nobody . There were soon with me about four hundred men . We knew the countryside and were fleet of foot . One of the first things I did was put my mother and father out of the way . I  | Moab to see if I could place them there with the king for safety , and he did allow them to come forth and dwell with him . The old family tie through my paternal great-grandmother , Ruth the N'Ioabitess , paid off , and I was able to discharge my filial obligations to my parents with good conscience . My father now was doddering with old age , and Moab was as good a nursing home as any in which to divest myself of him and my mother . As the numbers of my men increased , we made for ourselves the dens which are still found in the mountains and caves and strongholds . In these early stages , Fineberg 's law operated greatly to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later he would set out with thousands to take me . Fineberg 's law held that if he could see me where I was hiding , I could see him coming and therefore have time to take whatever steps I deemed appropriate . I could pack and get out of his way . And if the terrain into which he had confined us was hard , bleak , and forbidding , it was also relatively inaccessible and was impregnable to frontal assault and invulnerable to siege . We could simply circle off to the side away from him and give him the slip each time he advanced with his superior numbers . And that 's pretty much the way it worked out each time he did come down into the wilderness of Engedi , into the wilderness of Maon , and into the wilderness of Ziph . I was able to elude him easily and there were those two times I had him lying on the ground asleep before me and could have killed him . I made sure he knew it , too . " Is this thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , blinking and squinting as though smarting with pain , and wept when he understood I had spared him . Engedi was funny because Saul traipsed right into the cave in which we were hiding and did not detect our presence . Something similarly farfetched happened to Odysseus with the Cyclops , did n't it ? The one time Saul did have us nearly encompassed in the wilderness of Maon , the Philistines obligingly came to my rescue by putting pressure on him elsewhere and compelled him to withdraw to resist them . That was not , you know , the only time that Philistine and I cooperated to the advantage of both . In fact , my only compunction when I went with King Achish to fight for the Philistines against Saul at Gilboa was that I had no compunction . This caused me often to wonder about myself . My dilemma , in retrospect , in going to fight against Saul and my own people is that I had no dilemma . Who asked them to remain obedient to Saul when they already knew he was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Bathsheba was pregnant , he obstinately declined to sleep with her 1 I 1 t  | him two chances , did n't I ? Did I kill Uriah to avoid a scandal or because I already had settled in my soul that I wanted his wife ? God knows . For not only is the heart deceitful in all things , it is also desperately wicked . Even mine . This danger in being a king is that after a while you begin to believe you really are one . Fineberg , you know , is capricious , and Fineberg 's law ceased operating to my benefit as the size of my private army grew larger . If the craggy region in which we dwelt provided a natural fortress , it was also sufficiently inhospitable to deny the formidable force that developed around me the comforts and luxuries that might have induced us to remain . It was no kind of life . Thus , the day inevitably dawned when it was expedient to roll up our belongings and penetrate farther into Judah from the boundary of the Philistines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trepidation . Faint heart never fucked a cook . Off we went from Adullam to a new site in the forest of Hareth . And next , after due discussion and deliberation , we took our first dynamic step and embarked upon a bold martial venture against a troop of Philistines who had stormed into the Judean town of Keilah and were pillaging the threshing floors . It was just before we ventured to Keilah that I talked to God for the first time . And He answered . He helped me decide . Back then , He always answered me , and I had no need for a Samuel or a Nathan . I could speak for myself . I was on even better terms with my God , back then , than they ever were . No wonder I grew proud . I had to learn later that pride goeth before destruction , and a haughty spirit before a fall . Abiathar , sole survivor of the horrendous massacre of the priests and their households , fled down to me then , holding the sacred ephod of his dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought news of the carnage . It dumbfounds me still that others went on serving Saul after that , and that he was always able to muster his three thousand to chase me . Because he was a king ? What is a king ? I have been a king for forty years and still do n't know why people rejoiced to see me , felt sanctified by a word or look from me , why my soldiers cared enough about my life to risk their own to preserve me . I took Abiathar in because his father had died praising me . " Who is so faithful as David among all thy servants ? " his father had said defiantly , defending me to Saul . To which Saul decreed , " Thou shalt surely die . " " Abide thou with me , fear not , " I hastened to assure the young Abiathar , who looked like a ghost and was quailing with fright . " For he that secketh thy life scekcth my life . With me thou shalt be shielded . I will - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept that promise and want to make certain that my old friend will be secure after I 'm gone . Adonijah is no problem , for Abiathar , naive and orthodox as always , is helpful toward Adonijah and endorses his idea for a big outdoor luncheon on the hill . Bathsheba and Solomon leave me in doubt . " Be charitable , " I observe to the former , " to those who are old and well stricken with age , like Abiathar . Someday , you know , you too will be old . " " Abiathar ? " my blonde Bathsheba replies vaguely , and allows the substance of my thought to go right by her while fingering sensuously one of the gold hoop earrings she is wearing . Solomon is harder work , because he does n't simulate . " Shlomo , please pay very close attention to what I 'm about to say to you . I have great concern for my priest Abiathar . " I find myself pausing with a frown . My son the prince is conscientiously indenting even these prefatory remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am dead and buried ? " " May you live forever , " he breaks in. " ? it will probably fall to your brother Adonijah to be king . " " He is only my half brother , " Solomon is punctilious in reminding me . " Should anything unforeseen betide Adonijah to prevent his becoming king ? " " Yes ? " says Solomon , looking up quickly . " ? I would want you to follow to the letter what I say now about Abiathar . " " What could happen to Adonijah to prevent him from becoming king ? " " We are here now to talk about Abiathar , " I reprove him . And then I am distracted again by his busyness with his stylus . " Solomon , give me the answer to something that intrigues me . Why do you still write in clay when almost everybody else now uses papyrus ? " " I think I 'm getting smart , " he says with a nuance of vanity . " How are you getting smart ? " " Paper rots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe he is getting smart . I nod sadly . " I worry so much already about all of my scrolls , " I admit . " Sooner or later they will spoil , and no one will ever be able to read a word about me after I 'm gone . I wish I had taken my words down in clay . " " I take your words down in clay . "  | those I 've written . My proverbs and my psalms and my other songs . " " Put your scrolls in a cave at Engedi at the Dead Sea , " Solomon tells me with a certitude bordering on presumption . " What are you talking about ? " I bridle . " If you wish to preserve them . That will do it . " " Yeah-yeah . " " They 'll last there . " " Never mind . " " I mean it , " Solomon insists . " Have it your way . " " The air is without moisture at the Dead Sea , " Solomon goes on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store them carefully in one of the caves at Engedi . " " Stop talking like a fool , " I chastise him when I 've had more than I can take . " How can paper last for years ? I was telling you .... " " Abiathar , " he reads back , in reminder . " Has been my friend almost all my life . " I am annoyed with myself for having allowed him to waste my time . " Through thick and through thin . I want to be at peace concerning him . No matter what ensues after I have given up the ghost , I wish Abiathar to be held guiltless of all things , by you and all others . Do you understand my meaning ? " Solomon nods gravely , as though impressed deeply by the responsibility with which I have just entrusted him . " I understand your meaning . " " What is my meaning ? " " You do not want me to let his hoar head go down in peace to the grave , right ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I groan silently , and fortify myself with a deep breath . " No , no , no , no , no ! " I fairly scream at him . " Are you moronic or something ? Ca n't you get even one thing right ? " Solomon is unshaken by my outburst . " You do want me to kill him , do n't you ? " " No , Shlomo , " I correct him with a sigh . " I do n't want you to kill , him . There is a difference . Do n't you know what guiltless means ? " " No . " " No ? " My train of thought , so to speak , is stopped in its track . " You do n't know what guiltless means ? " " No , " says Solomon . " Can you figure it out ? " " hoar head ? " he guesses .

" " Look everything up , " I direct him emphatically , " because you 've got everything I 've been telling you about Abiathar confused with Joab and Shimei . " " Shimei ? " He looks blank . " You forgot already about Shimei ? " I am hurt and indignant . " I never told you about Shimei ? " I am appalled that he shakes his head . " You really do n't know about Shimei ? How can that be ? How he cursed me and threw filth at me when I was running away from Jerusalem , and how he groveled in the dirt at my feet when I came back triumphant after putting down the rebellion of Absalom ? You never heard about Shimei and the rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Shimei . I know I told you about Shimei . What the goddamn hell 's the matter with you anyway ?

" " Who the hell tells you to make them ? Answer me truthfully . You really do n't know what guiltless means ? " " How should I know what guiltless means ? " " Without guilt , Solomon . Solomon , ca n't a bright boy like you grasp something like that ? " " Of course I can , once I have it explained to me . " He nods briskly . " Now I understand . You do want me to let his hoar head go down in peace to the grave , do n't you ? Should I or should I not ? " " You should . " His face shows disappointment . " I 'll have to redo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word not . " " That does the trick ! " He executes the correction with alacrity . " Now , about hoar head ? " " That 's not important now , " I tell him . " Just remember Abiathar. " that 's all you have to work on today . Can you remember a simple thing like his name ? " " Of course I can , " says Solomon . " Whose ? "  | She walks in beauty like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies , my exquisite Shunammite , and again shows my son Solomon the door . At my request , she brings in Benaiah , of the broad shoulders , deep chest , and strong arms , to whom I reiterate my deathbed bequest of benevolence for Abiathar . Benaiah has kept himself alive , despite the murderous animosity of Joab , of whose lethal jealousy I shrewdly apprised him when I named him to command my palace guard . " Perhaps you should instruct Nathan as well , " Benaiah suggests . " Nathan , " I remark sourly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad shoulders , deep chest , and strong arms misses my sarcasm , and another deplorable saying is coined . I swear I often feel I was much better off in the days when I was struggling to endure and be king than I 've been since I became one . Succeeding is more satisfying than success . Believe it or not , God always seemed to reply whenever I talked to Him . I asked a question , He gave me a civil answer , invariably supplying the one I wanted to receive . Our talks went smoothly . He never thundered at me as He did at Moses . He did n't even ask me to take off my shoes . If I wanted to know , I asked . And the first time I asked was before the expedition to Keilah . A number of my men were balky at that prospect , contending that our survival in Judah was risky enough without revealing ourselves to both Saul and the Philistines in a fashion so provocative to both . The Philistines were making war against the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to attack them was mine . But I had to be sure , for a failure at the start would mean my immediate finish . I decided to have a crack at talking directly with God . I 'd never put much faith in divination by smoke . " I think I want to mull it over , " I made known to those with whom I was in council , and moved off alone to a tree-shaded clearing in the woods . What could I lose ? The worst He could do was not say anything . I came right out with it . " Shall I go and smite these Philistines ? " I put it to Him bluntly . I was not certain in which direction to look . And the Lord came through for me . " Go and smite the Philistines , " He said unto me at once . " Arise , go down to save Keilah . " " Behold , we are much afraid here in Judah , " I informed Him . " I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicious state of elation , I rushed back to the others and proclaimed : " The Lord hath said He will deliver the Philistines into our hand !

" They gaped with awe .  | So off I went with my men to Keilah and fought with the Philistines , and hocked and shlugged them and aggravated them too , until their heads were aching and their bones were breaking and they could not stand it anymore , and we brought away their cattle , and smote them with a great slaughter , saving the inhabitants of Keilah from further oppression and atrocity . We felt like heroes . My men relaxed and celebrated . City life was intoxicating . They smiled incessantly and wanted to stay . " It 's so much better than in the woods , " Joab recommended . I was shaking my head . " What 's wrong ? " " Saul . How long do you think it will take him to come down after us once he learns we have camped inside a city with walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the gates and lock him out , " he argued . " Why not ? " " Fineberg 's law . " " Fineberg ? " " If we can lock him out , " I elucidated , " he can lock us in . And the men of Keilah ? " I went on . " What do you think they are going to do when they hear that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake ? " " The men of Keilah ? " Joab did not hesitate a moment . " We risked our lives to deliver these people . The men of Keilah are grateful and will be loyal to us . " " Do n't bet on it . " " They will stand by us to the end . " " I think I want to mull that one over , " I said , and walked off by myself to be alone in the woods again . I could easily picture Saul concluding with glee that God had delivered me into his hand because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Saul , " I said to God , coming straight to the point again . I did not want to take up too much of His time . " Will Saul come down to Keilah after me as Thy servant believes ? " " You bet your ass , " said the Lord . " And will the men of Keilah deliver us into the hand of Saul ? " " It 's funny you should ask . " " They will ? " " They will deliver thee up . " " Then we 'd better get away , right ? " " You do n't have to go to college , " said the I , ord , " to figure that one out for yourself . " Again I went hurrying back with my revelations . " As God is my witness , " I announced with urgency , " we must arise and depart from hcrc  | quickly , for Saul will call his people together for war and come down to Keilah to besiege us here . " So we arose out of Keilah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us every day . By this time my men had increased to about six hundred . Saul never had less than three thousand . We abode for a while in strongholds in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph . We moved as well through the wilderness of Maon and the wilderness of Engedi . All are regions of the wilderness of Judah , and it is sometimes difficult for outsiders to tell the individual wildernesses apart . Ziph is near Ziph , Engedi is near Engedi , and the wilderness of Maon surrounds Carmel , where I found Abigail married to Nabal and took my first real woman as my first true wife right after her unmannered pig of a husband died . I did not wait long to propose after I heard she was widowed . Maybe a minute . It was in a wood in the wilderness of Ziph that Jonathan sought me out to assure me forthrightly of his faith that his father would not find me because I was favored by God and that he saw too now that I would surely be king over Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I responded with a piety equaling his own , " to God 's ears . " He was talking more from feeling than demonstrable fact , but I was glad to hear him anyway , and was not put off by his choked voice and the density of emotions he was manifesting . Neither one of us could know that this was fated to be our last meeting : he would be killed at Gilboa , with me almost on the opposite side , and never enjoy seeing his prophecy fulfilled . " And I shall serve thee and be next unto thee , " he continued solemnly in a vow that events rendered moot , his eyes staring downward with a kind of demoralized humility . " Fear not the hand of my father , for thou shalt be king , and that also my father knoweth . It 's the reason he 's so confused and unhappy . He does n't like me , David . He 's never really liked me . He would have had me killed after I did so well at the battle of Michmash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I believe it was because he was jealous . The people rose up as one to save me . But then , my father has never really liked any of his children . You were the one he seemed to love briefly as the only person who would never disappoint him and never fail at anything . Maybe that 's the reason he fears you now and wants to kill you . " " According to him , I 'm supposed to want to kill him . " " He is n't sane , David . At Michmash , he wanted to fight them headon . He still wants to fight them head-on . I think my father never wants  | anyone to succeed him , and hopes to take all the rest of us to death along with him . At Michmash , I felt I had to do something to stop him . That 's why I stole away at night with my armor bearer to try my luck up that twisting path in the mountains to the Philistine outpost . It was a stony , steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't mount it quickly . I found myself between a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other . " He gambled on making known his presence to the enemy sentries , representing himself as a local Israelite who 'd hidden in a cave and who now begged permission to return to his own poor house in the wilderness . " If they allow us to go up , " he had whispered to his armor bearer , " we will go up . I will take my spear and hope that the Lord hath delivered them into our hand . If they do n't , they do n't . We 'll go back to the camp . Nothing ventured , nothing gained . " Contemptuously , derisively , they allowed him to come up , prepared to hector him as he passed through and perhaps pull his beard . " Behold , the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves , " they called to each other . " Come up , come up to us , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them they should have bitten off their tongues . About twenty of them in a half acre Jonathan slew before they began to comprehend his ruse . Fleeing survivors , believing him the vanguard of a large encirclement , spread chaos in the main camp with their exaggerated reports . Rumor was rampant and pandemonium reigned . By dawn 's early light the watchmen of the Israelites beheld the Philistines beating down one another and the multitude melting away in headlong retreat . Saul took advantage of the opportunity with an order to charge , then loused things up with a senseless pledge to God that appeared to be aimed vindictively at Jonathan . " Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening , " was the harebrained order of the day Saul decreed , having called the roll by then and learned full well that it could be only Jonathan who had started the ball rolling , and that Jonathan , who had not yet returned , would be uninformed of the ban . Faint from fasting , the Israelites had to leave off pursuing their enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoils of sheep , oxen , and calves , slew them to the ground , and ate them with the blood . Saul disapproved of that . Jonathan returned with his eyes enlightened by the taste of honey he had taken in the wood . f le was critical of Saul 's prohibition against eating food when he saw how it had interfered with the much greater slaughter among the Philistines that could easily have ensued .  | Grimly and methodically , Saul embarked on his merciless course of revenge against him . He cast lots in a process of elimination . The tribe was narrowed down to Benjamin , the family to his own , the culprit then to Jonathan . " I did but taste a little wild honey with the end of my rod , " Jonathan admitted affectingly , " and lo , for this I must die ? " " For this , " Saul answered with a shrug , as though washing his hands of responsibility , " thou shalt surely die , Jonathan . " But the people knew that it was Jonathan who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they would not allow one hair of his head to fall to the ground . They rescued him that he died not , and they kept him safe until the resentment of his father had subsided . " He was envious of me , " Jonathan confided . " He was envious of me for the part I had played . He never really trusted or liked me after that . It was his way of getting rid of me . We could see his temper blazing in his eyes . When I understood he really meant to kill me , I realized something . My father the king was mad . And then I realized something worse . The Lord my God was also mad . And when I realized that , I began to weep . My heart was broken , and I did not care . " I gave thanks to God that Jonathan did not weep then . Jonathan did love me , I know now , and I did not love him . And I know that does n't feel good . I know because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved my son Absalom , and he would have killed me if he could , and would have been able to had he set right out to overtake me instead of procrastinating complacently after listening to the counsel of the secret agent I left behind to flatter and mislead him . Yet I could not kill Saul when I had the chance . It takes all kinds to make a world , does n't it ? Looking back , I find myself contrite that I was not more openhearted in my remarks to Jonathan at what proved to be our final meeting . I was rather cold , imperious . How could I know he was going to die ? Of all sad words of tongue or pen , the saddest are these : it might have been . I had those two good chances for killing Saul . My first in the cave of Engedi , amid the sheepcotes upon the rocks of the wild goats , when Saul came in to relieve himself where we were hiding and stretched out on the ground to cover his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , my heart was wrung by a nauseating mixture of pity and dread when I found the opportunity to obtain his death so close at hand , and I let him go . " The bird delivered him right into your hand , " charged Abishai  | after Saul had gone . " Why would you not let me smite him with my spear even to the earth at once ? I would not have had to smite him a second time . " I responded simply . " I thought he reminded me of my father as he slept . " " Grandpa Jesse does n't look like Saul at all , " Abishai argued sullenly . I decided to let the matter drop . It was always casting pearls before swine to try to reason from sentiment with the three hard sons of my sister Zeruiah , or with any of the rough six hundred who were with me then . Uriah the Hittite , then unwed , was among those six hundred that far back , and was even one of my thirty mighty men . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded him liberally with an extended estate in the south to cultivate for his pleasure and to safeguard as an outpost . Who asked him to choose a libidinous wife with the hots for Jerusalem ? Is it my fault she took a shine to me after he succumbed to her insistence and agreed to move here ? I should have warned him ; I could have told him by then that it is better to dwell with a lion or a dragon than to keep house with a wicked woman , for I had already reclaimed my wife Michal from Phalti and she was living with me in my palace and buzzing all about me like a hornet . As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged , so is a wife full of words to a quiet man . What was a horny young king like me to do when a radiant treat like Bathsheba laid it all out for me to see that eveningtide from the roof of my royal residence ? I did what any normal , virile tyrant would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lay with her , and as simple as that was the imperceptible drift into the turbulent and depressing second half of my life , with its succession of tragedies for which virtually nothing I had undergone had prepared me . By the time I was sixty , I had lost my capacity for experiencing joy , and the years had drawn nigh when I could say I had no pleasure in them . I could say that the Devil made me do it . The Devil always comes in handy that way , does n't he ? Everything was so much easier back there with Abigail ; all slipped conveniently into place with an easiness wondrous to behold as we met and came together in those footloose , carefree years of banditry and extortion in the wilds of southern Judah . The substance of me and my men grew with our reputation . We took wives . I took Abigail as soon as she was available , which was about two weeks after I met her . That worked so well that , with Abigail approving , I took Ahimoam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too many wives when he is on the move a great deal and there is so much housework to be done . All of them can pitch in.  | We lived off the land . Or rather , we lived off the landowners , which is a different thing entirely . That 's how I found Abigail . " Give us food and clothing , " I or one of my men would suggest to inhabitants of the region having the largest flocks of sheep and goats , the lushest vineyards and largest groves of olive , fig , date , and nut trees , the broadest , longest fields of wheat and barley , of melons , lentils , flat beans , garlics , and onions , " and we will make it our business to see that no one steals from you even one sheep . " " Who would steal from us a sheep ? " they were naive enough to ask . " Who knows ? " After a long pause I would go on . " But I , David the son of Jesse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thieves and plunderers . I and my men will be a wall unto you both day and night . " " There are no thieves and plunderers in Judah , " they did answer at first . " There are now . " I would give this reply without smiling , looking grimly into the face of each landowner I addressed . It was really no mystery to me that the people of Ziph in my native Judah came up often to Gibeah to Saul , saying where my hiding places were and volunteering to deliver me into the king 's hand if he came down after me . Any sense of hurt I may have expressed was synthetic . Only from a fat slob like Nabal , the husband of my precious Abigail , did I meet with discourteous refusal and decide upon the very violent consequences that were averted narrowly by the prompt diplomacy of the stunning woman herself . Abigail was a woman of exceptional understanding and of a beautiful countenance . As Nabal 's wife , she was a jewel of gold in a swine 's snout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice way ? I sent ten young men to him with polite solicitations and with discreet reminders that we had not hurt any of his shearers or his shepherds , nor was there aught missing among them all the while we were in Carmel . His shepherds would vouch for the fact that the whole year through I steadfastly had protected him from us . But the man was an utter boor , and he coarsely rejected the appeal of my messengers that he share with us a small amount of the prosperity we so earnestly wished to be able to allow him to continue to enjoy . Nabal was known by everyone as churlish and evil in his doings , as a potbellied glutton and drunkard who did not appreciate or deserve so fine a wife as the woman who rode out to greet us the following day when I and four hundred were walking with rapid stride to kill not only him but every  | " Who is this David that I owe him anything ? " he rashly ridiculed my men in front of his own , eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sheepshearing in which he was just then indulging himself with a complete lack of restraint . He mocked my men in their noses with a snap of his fingers . " Who is this son of Jesse ? Is he the king , or even a servant of the king , that I must cater to him ? A fig for your David ? no , not even a fig , not one fig for your David . Ha , ha ! " God knows I was incensed when my messengers acquainted me with the rude fashion in which my modest proposal had been dismissed . I never could bear having emissaries of mine demeaned . When Hanun the son of Nahash of Ammon defiled the people I had sent in peace to help comfort him on the death of his father , I could not rest until I had exacted my revenge . He shaved off the one half of the beards of my messengers , and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks , before he released them to return to me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities of Ammon after that ; from one year to the next , I did not let up until the last fortress was overthrown and all the people of Ammon were put under saws , and under harrows of iron , and under axes of iron , and were made to pass through the brick kiln , and their king 's crown , the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones , was taken from off his head and set upon my own . And even then I did not feel wholly appeased . All of that was very much later , when I was already a mighty king , but it was with no less monumental a rage that I determined to avenge Nabal 's insult in the only way I knew how , and began firing orders for my men to make ready for battle . " Come not at your wives this night , " I began with a shout . " We 're going to war ? " " Against Nabal of Carmel . " " No shit ? " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gird ye on every man his sword . " I do n't kid around . At daybreak , I girded on my sword and set out toward Carmel leading four hundred of my men , leaving two hundred others behind to abide by our stuff . Luckily I never got there . Luckily , Abigail , alerted by one of the young men in her husband 's employ to the danger provoked so needlessly , had busied herself to help make amends and atone for the sin against me committed by her husband . I never knew a woman more practical . She took two hundred loaves , and two bottles of wine , and five sheep already dressed , and five measures of parched corn , and a hundred clusters of  | not a word to her husband Nabal about what she was doing and rode out to meet us with five pretty damsels who were her servants . I 'm glad she did , for more reasons than one . In the long run , it probably would have redounded strongly to my disadvantage if I had pursued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house that pissed against the wall . We were all of us on foot . Forget about horses  --  we did n't have any , and no one anywhere then knew how to ride them . Abigail had rouged her cheeks and lips , made up her eyes , and brushed and tied her dark hair . She had attired herself in a robe and mantle of brilliant desert scarlet . I brought my march to a halt when I saw a string of asses bearing provisions come into view against the bright sky and move down by the covert of the hill to meet us . I did not know who she was until after she had arrived and dismounted and announced herself . We had never seen each other before . She had not dreamt I was good-looking . I did not know she was beautiful . I think you could have heard a pin drop there on the road to Carmel as she hasted the final few yards on her animal , lighted off the ass , fell before me on her face at my feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hear her words and beseeched me to restrain myself from shedding blood . She begged my pardon repeatedly . She was older than I , dear woman , and clearly more knowing and cosmopolitan and , from her place on her knees , she stared upward at me after the first few moments with an unwavering look of frank admiration . A gleam in her eye made no secret of what she thought of me . We were close enough to touch . For the longest time I could not move my gaze from her face . Then I could not take my eyes off her tits . I felt my member harden and begin to stand out . Abigail noticed it all , she confided a fortnight later when we were lying together as man and wife in one of the several good goatskin tents she had included in the dowry she had brought from the estate of her newly deceased husband . She was too much the lady to give any indication at the time . And besides , she was pleading for her life and , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the house of Nabal as well . Ten years later , I was struck for the second time in my life with that same dumbfounding thunderbolt of passionate love , when I looked into a bathtub on a roof a half block away and saw Bathsheba , assisted by a servant girl with an azure water pitcher , rinsing her pale and rosy voluptuous body with her head turned brazenly in my direction . Who ever loved that loved not at first sight ? The setting was not as pictorially romantic as it might seem . Her building was low and deteri ? J . L - I:wwJ ... A w A l2 .... a . uuwn vs ? eIr.ew  | difficult to come by in Jerusalem , and even the roof of my own palace was , as usual , cluttered with figs , dates , and flax set out to dry , along with the family wash strung out on ropes . I had to pick my way along narrow lanes in the relaxing , cooling strolls I took each evening to escape the stenches and stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps a few of my other wives . Ahinoam , Maccah , and Haggith were perfect mates  --  they hardly talked at all , and when they passed away , they attracted barely any notice . Abigail I still miss . I always loved her . Nevertheless , my mouth watered the moment I laid eyes on Bathsheba : she looked to me like peaches and cream , and the mounds of her tiny breasts were tipped with the colors of wild raspberries or fresh currants . " What woman is that ? " I wanted to know . It was Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah . I sent for her anyway and lay with her that same day , for she had finished her bath and was purified from her uncleanliness . Not that the opposite condition would have given either one of us any pause . I could tell within minutes after we began that I had got me a woman with sexual experience considerably more varied than my own . And even while finding her fruits so sweet to my taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned , to envy bitterly the very , very many who had enjoyed her and made versatile use of her in the more artless periods of her girlhood when she still looked up to people and it still was possible to impress and surprise her with something different , something new or better . I felt basely overshadowed by them . All I could offer was love . It was with a combination of gladness and dismay that I told myself I had taken a tigress by the tail I would be happy to be rid of and whom I would also feel , hopelessly , I could not live without . I would follow her on bleeding feet . I would follow her as weeping Phalti did my wife Michal when I demanded her back as a preliminary to negotiations . I was less autocratic with Abigail , and she was more deferential , though I was not yet king . I was bewitched by her eloquence and reserve , by her lustrous grooming and her refinement and dignity . " Upon me , my lord , upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her place on the ground at my feet . " I pray thee , hear the words of thine handmaid . " It was n't always clear to me whose life she was seeking to save , for she seemed to be condemning Nabal along with all the rest of my enemies . But she gave me her blessing and entreated me to leave the matter of vengeance to heaven sooner than shed blood myself in an enterprise that might bring grief unto me afterward . Abigail always made sense . And she  | was another in the growing roster of those foreseeing that someday soon the Lord would appoint me ruler over Israel . " From your mouth , " I replied with regal courtesy , dipping my head in assent , " to God 's ears . Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , " I went on with warmth , " which sent thee this day to meet me . And blessed be thy advice , for in very deed , as the Lord God liveth , if thou hadst not come to meet me , surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light any that pisseth against the wall . " I accepted from her the goods she had brought and bestowed upon her the reassurances she had come for . What a nice love story , I thought . I had never met a woman for whom I had a higher regard . " See , I have hearkened to thy voice . Go up in peace to thine house . " It was with a pang that I watched her take leave , an aching sense of unfair deprivation with which I watched her remount and ride away back to her husband with the good news that killed him about ten days later . Joab was studying me sharply . I gave a start of uneasiness . " What 's wrong ? " I inquired , fidgeting . " Why were you lisping ? " he demanded angrily . " Lisping ? " I was baffled . " Who was lisping ? " " You were . " " When ? " " Before . " " Lisping ? " I repeated in disbelief . " What are you talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You said pisseth , did n't you ? " " Pisseth ? " " That'th right . You thaid all who pisseth against the wall . " " I thaid pisseth ? " I was furious now and answered him with a heat that equaled his own . " I thaid no thuch thing . " " Yeth , you did . Athk anyone . " " Let'th get these provisions moving , Joab , before they thpoil in the sun . I command thee . Pisseth ? Indeed ! " He gave ground grudgingly . " I wish she 'd brought more . " It ith  --  it is a source of continual amazement to me that Joab , despite the lifelong antagonism simmering between us , has never once betrayed me , although I was certain he had switched sides the night I abandoned Jerusalem to escape the converging forces of Absalom . Where was he ? I felt that night that I had spent half my life running from Saul and the other half fleeing my son and his allies . I still remain unconvinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broke with him afterward . Aoainst my wishes . he murdered Abner. he murdered Amass. he-executed  | Absalom as he hung by his head from the boughs of that oak tree by which he had been caught up . For this last , I have never been able to forgive him , although he did me an extraordinary favor by doing so . Flow could I possibly have spared the life of a beloved child when loyal soldiers had laid down their own lives to prevent him from killing me ? Yet how could I have taken it ? But ever since , I have been waiting for Joab to make that one mistake that would give me sufficient public reason to take off his head . I would like to hear a national outcry against him . He may be committing that blunder now when he staunchly befriends my eldest son , Adonijah , and encourages his preparations for that outdoor feast they wish to give . Do they intend to proclaim Adonijah king ? There is a significant difference between saying he will be king and declaring he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended a caterer for the affair , his wife 's brother . And Joab was the one who , with criminal motive or not , induced me to bring back into the city the one thing in the world I wanted most to have near  --  that same son Absalom . Go figure out that one . In no time at all , it seemed , Absalom was setting fire to Joab 's barley field . I grinned with pride in my audacious son as I listened to doughty Joab complain like a milksop . " He says he will set fire to all my fields if I do not come and plead with you to let him see you . It 's been two years now , David . Why did you allow him to return from exile if you did not wish him to see your face ? " " Why did you urge me to ? " " Do n't you want to look at him and talk to him again ? " My heart broke , and I relented and lifted the order of banishment keeping him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Absalom to come into my house . I kissed him when I saw him . I took him in my arms and held him and burst into tears before he even began to justify himself for the slaying of his brother Amnon . I never even forced him to beg my forgiveness . I put him to work as my surrogate , to deal with people with complaints for which I had no patience . Once again he was the apple of my eye . And in no time at all , it seemed , the apple of my eye was sweeping toward Jerusalem in a whirlwind of fire and in chariots of fiery horses , and I was fleeing my city with my large household as rapidly as I could move . I low was he able to mount so large a rebellion so swiftly and fiercely ? Why did he want to ? It was not the best of times , I 'll admit , but was it the worst ?

Ahitophel , the shrewdest and most stoically pragmatic of my advisers , turned traitor too . And I could not drive from my mind that it was Joab , of all people , who had importuned me to terminate the banishment of Absalom and grant him the amnesty allowing his return . As I wended my way downward in a descent that seemed to correspond symbolically to my loss of powers , I saw Joab waiting behind every bush , like a bear . So surprising it was for this man impervious to all sentimental feelings to read my heart so accurately and take the trouble to intervene that way . It was n't like him at all . It was , in fact , the only time in our long lives that he made proper obeisance to me as a king , another galling detail that keeps my hunches about him operating even now . I still believe it was the incident of the barley field that divided him from Absalom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of the wise woman of Tekoah to play on my emotions in his stratagem for Absalom 's return . He dressed her in widow 's weeds and sent her in to me with a dolorous cock-and-bull story of family murder and flight paralleling my own distressful tragedy so closely that she was able to turn the charitable verdict I rendered into a moral for resolving my own dilemma . I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard her say : " Wherefore then doth the king not fetch home again his own banished son ? For we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground , which can not be gathered up again . " I have never liked parables . " Who put you up to this ? " I wanted to know . Joab was soon on the scene to advocate openly . " Oh , David , David , why be so foolish ? Bring him back , bring him back . It 's clear you miss him . You 're a king . You can do whatever you want . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my voice . I could not handle that subject without emotion . " He committed a crime . " Joab was almost patronizing . " There are no laws . This is Joab , David . No laws are legitimate . And there is no such thing as crime . " " God 's laws ? " " God 's laws , " he echoed cynically . " Thou shalt not kill ? " " We kill all the time . " " ' Thou shalt not kill thy brother ? " " I lc was only a half brother . And where is that written ? Cain killed Abel , and did n't God give him a seal of protection ?

I never liked Saul . If a king be sad , what little is there left for anyone to hope for ? Shall I go to Geshur and bring him ? " " Go . " I gave in gladly at the end with a tremendous wave of relief . " Go to Geshur and bring the young man Absalom home again . Let him be as safe as Cain . But let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . I ca n't give him all . " Then it was that Joab fell to the ground  --  the only time in the forty years I 've been king that he did so  --  and bowed himself and thanked me , saying , " Today thy servant knows I have found grace in thy sight . " Who would have supposed that he even thought of himself as my servant ? " Make clear to him also , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , " in a whisper into his ear , so that nobody about will know , that I am sorry . Tell him I apologize . I should have punished Amnon some way after he did what he did , but I still would n't know how . Amnon was my child also . " Bet your bottom dollar Joab would have known how . What business was all this of his anyway ? My son Absalom was the talk of the town as soon as he was back , and I waxed with pride in the adulation I knew he was receiving . I longed to see him in the two years I permitted him so near , yet kept him away . I thrived on every piece of information about him . In all Israel there was none to be much praised as Absalom for beauty . From the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish on him . And when he polled his head at every year 's end  --  it was only at year 's end that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and heavy on him  --  he weighed the hair at two hundred shekels , that 's more than five pounds of hair . Even with the ointment factored out , that 's still a pretty good head of hair . Many 's the time I yearned to look upon him and deplored the injunction of separation I had imposed . Absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him to clear the streets when he rode . No one thought much of Adonijah then , who is but a pallid copy now . Solomon ? Ignored . And before you knew it , Absalom was setting Joab 's barley field on fire . I must admit I laughed . " ' That 's Absalom , " I commented to Joab , with a happy lift of my arms , and consented to the full reconciliation I craved with the son I now pardoned .  | me who wanted to come , and fleeing the city lest he find me there and smite Jerusalem with the edge of the sword to capture me . He was humping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbrage that we heard how , in a tent spread for him upon the top of my palace , he went in unto the ten women I had left behind to keep the house . " On the same day ? " I exclaimed with amazement . " All ten ? " " That 's what they say . " " But those were my ten worst concubines ! " " That 's Absalom , " they exclaimed with indulgence . " It would have taken me a whole year . " It did not seem altogether believable to me that someone so ruthlessly direct as Joab would scheme so ploddingly in his supplication affecting the split between a father and the only one of his children for whom he truly felt love . I have no real evidence that he did . But where was he , I brooded fearfully as I abandoned the city with those who were faithful to me and made my way first to brook Kidron at the edge of Jerusalem . From there I went up barefoot by the ascent of the Mount of Olives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take stock of my disastrous predicament . Trumpets proclaiming Absalom king had sounded all over the land , in the south and in the north . My Cherethites and Pelethites were with me . So was Ittai the Gittite , bless his heart , that man without a homeland now , and he brought with him the six hundred mercenaries who had come up with him from Gath after I had subdued and dispersed the Philistines . And Abishai was along with a regiment , muddling with still greater confusion my doleful speculations about Joab . I no sooner had escaped Jerusalem from Absalom than I found myself exposed as I passed Bahurim to the loathsome vituperations of that obscene and obnoxious baboon Shimei , who , red-eyed and red-gummed , subjected me to a tirade of such verbal abuse as I had never been exposed to before . Another bad-tempered Benjamite he was  --  Sheba , who blew a trumpet to call all Israel to renounce me after I had triumphed over Absalom , was still another intractable Benjamite prick who wanted to make trouble for me . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethmaachah to kill Sheba , and Joab killed Amasa at the start in order to put himself in charge of that assignment himself . I had to restrain my men from killing Shimei . " " Thou bloody man , come out , come out , " that Shimei howled and jeered at me with vicious glee . " The Lord bath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul in whose stead thou Nast reigned . " What blood ? What house of Saul ? What was he talking about ? And Absalom  --  he was not bloody ? Oh , what a fall was there , that I should have  | revolting jackal . He cast dust on my head . For a famous absolute monarch who , but a week before , was disposed to view himself in the polished mirror of his fancy as uncritically revered , the shocks and insults of which I now unexpectedly found myself the target were almost too grotesque to comprehend . My nephew Abishai was incensed . " Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go across the road , I pray thee , and take off his head . " I put a hand on his arm and said no . " Let him curse , " I answered solemnly . " Behold , my son Absalom , which came forth of my bowels , seeketh my life . How much more cause now may this Benjamite have to do it ? " " No cause , no cause , " said Abishai . Where would Shakespeare have been without me ? At a brick mold , maybe , or a potter 's wheel . Who was it that loved not wisely but too well ? Me and Bathsheba , or Othello and that wop ? It 's not for nothing that I was known as the sweet singer of Israel . I even made up that name . And of what crimes against the house of Saul was he accusing me , David , the boy wonder , who had never raised a hand against my king or any in his family and in whose mouth it had long been said that butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he cackled shrilly like a man possessed . True , I had killed Uriah , but that was about all . And who the fuck was a repulsive gnome like Shimei to speak for God to me , when I had always been much closer to Him than anyone else in my time ? And feel I still am , even though I think He may not be here anymore , and will not lower myself to speak to Him again until He eats crow like a man and apologizes like a decent human being for what He did to my dead baby . Who else but me can ever justify the ways of God to man ? The good Lord has n't got a Chinaman 's chance of surviving with His reputation intact if He leaves it to toadies like Nathan , who came sniveling up to me again after Shimei had stopped throwing stones and had been left behind . God talks to Nathan , Nathan says , but He does n't always talk sense , if you 're going to believe what Nathan tells you He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me from the beginning , holding me responsible for everything bad that was occurring . As though I did n't already have enough troubles on my mind without him . We bickered and snapped at each other constantly , like two old farts near senility . Nathan does n't like to walk . Now he blamed me for Shimei . " Maybe the Lord has bidden him to do it , " I told him without looking  | up . " You know , Nathan , there is a time to gather up stones , and a time to cast away stones . " My words did not impress him . " There be three things that go well , " he informed me in his sulky way , straying off on a tack of his own . " What are you bitching about now ? " " Yea , four are comely in going . " " How many guesses do I have ? " " A lion which is strongest among beasts , and turneth not away for any . " " Go on . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A he-goat also . " " That 's three . " " And a king against whom there is no rising up . " He glanced at me smugly , smacking his lips . " Nathan , Nathan , what are you trying to tell me ? " I asked when he had finished . " The finding out of parables is a wearisome labor of the mind . " " My feet hurt . " " Your feet hurt ? " " Yes . " " Is that all ? " " Ca n't we stop ? " " We ca n't stop . Why could n't you come right out and tell me your feet hurt ? Do you always have to be so long-winded ? " " Does the rain have a father ? " " Another abstract question ? " " Or the lion roar when it hath no prey ? " " Nathan , my world is coming down around me in flames . Ca n't you give me a simple yes or no ? " " From a prophet you want a yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Does the elephant go with the raven ? " " Must you always be such a pain in the ass ? " " There are three things that are never satisfied , " Nathan rejoined . " Yea , four things say not , it is enough . Maybe five , even six . " " The sixth would be a prophet like you with a listener like me . " " My arches ache . My toes have blisters . " " Do us both a favor . Go down ahead and ride on one of the asses . "  | " I 'm afraid I 'll fall off . " " Get someone to hold you . " Nathan chewed a moment on the inside of his cheek . " And I do n't want to be near that slut . " " What slut ? " " Your wife . " " Which wife ? " " You 're not going to trap me . You know which wife , " he challenged . " You just want me to name her so you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . You should have listened to me . You should have done exactly what I told you , to the letter . " " You did n't tell me to do anything until it was already too late . How could I listen to you ? " " You should have listened anyway , " Nathan insisted . " You should have guessed . That sounds mysterious ? I 'll show you mysterious . There be three things which are too wonderful for me , yea , four which I know not . I 'll tell you what I do n't know . The way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid . There , I said it , did n't I ? " " What did you say ? What are you getting at this time ? " " Why did you have to keep fucking Bathsheba ? " " Did you tell me to stop ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a prophet , are n't you ? " " Not a fortune-teller . I only know when I 'm told . And it 's all coming true , is n't it ? " he gloated . " Everything I warned you about , the evil rising up against you from your own house , the neighbor with your wives in the sight of the sun . I was right , was n't I ? You wait . You just wait and see what Absalom does with those women you left behind . " " Is this what you meant ? " I answered him back . " Why did n't you come right out and tell me you were talking about Absalom ? " " How did I know I was talking about Absalom ? You should n't have taken Uriah 's wife and you should n't have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon , and that 's all there is to that . " " Why did n't you tell me that before I did it ? " " How did I know you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're supposed to know for yourself . Did I know you were going to send Uriah back to be killed ? I had to be told , did n't I ? " " By who ? " I questioned , levying upon him the full weight of my suspicions . " Joab ? " " I ... 1 . D " 1i. n ... w.l n- mw .. . h ... rl . I hail .. L .... I ( . ...  | " Do n't be foolish . You know by who . God . Where does Joab come in ? " " Where is Joab ? " I regarded him closely . " Do I know ? " " Is he out there ahead somewhere , waiting to ambush us ? " " God forbid ! " Nathan cried out , almost screaming . His face turned ashen . " It's-all your fault , " he resumed berating me , and paused to sniffle and to choke down a sob . " It will be on your conscience if anything happens to me . I blame only you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan , the earth is disquieted , " I told him harshly , running out of patience at last . " And for four which it can not bear . For a servant when he reigneth , and a fool when he is filled with meat . For an odious woman when she is married , and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress . And worse than all four , put together , is a blubbering nuisance like you filled with whimpers and recriminations at a catastrophic time like this . Do you think I can worry about you ? Go get more curses from God . Abishai ! Abisbai ! " I had Abishai transfer him far away from me to the front of our pathetic column , well out of earshot and closer to Bathsheba , whom he 'd vilified as a harlot , and with whom he is now in league . Misery makes strange bedfellows . I was sorry at last that Michal was dead . I would have relished placing him between the two of them . I began to torment myself with worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother Abishai as well , suspecting him too of potential treachery . Crazy as Saul in his deranged fixations about me , I was more and more certain that I detected the hand of Joab in Absalom 's successful coup , until we neared the Jordan and I found him awaiting me in staunch support with a large body of mighty men he had mustered to serve me . After that it was only a matter of reaching the river and crossing over to safety . When that was accomplished and we were resting on the other bank , I knew with a sinking heart that Absalom would lose in a battle against me that I could n't win . Faithful Joab  --  how I hated the sight of him , even though he had turned up on my side , especially because he had turned up on my side . I was reluctant to believe my eyes . How sad I was for my son . And in those first few hours , I was more vexed to discover my doubts about Joab baseless than thankful for his loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely cheated by his failure to justify my worst opinions about him . Crazy as Saul , I eyed him narrowly as we moved northward to Mahanaim in the land of Gilead to make our base , condemning him for .. . f .. l.n .. el. , . : . : .. n k:e - : . na .. nl. a n , t.n . nnn n ' 1 . st arena IMP. ; e.eVn:nwhl  | location more propitious for him . But Joab turned not after Absalom , although he has turned now to the cause of Adonijah , in compliance with what he believes is my wish . It is my wish . But he did not trouble to ask me first , But that is Joab . He is , he has bragged to me , the straw that stirs the drink , and he has always done what he wanted to . He did not trouble to ask if I wanted Absalom executed . " Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom " was the charge I had given for all the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Absalom , " I had repeated . Joab , ever more practical than I , disregarded my orders and put him to death . He did me that favor I 'll never forget . I have not been able to make whole sense out of him . He knows me too well to be enchanted by the mystiques of royalty and too long to be susceptible to the feelings of hero worship and idolatry I awake in people more distant from me who never make the effort to understand me at all . He does not believe I rule by divine right , and it would make no difference to him if he knew that I did . To him , all I 've done is succeed  --  nothing more . I am intrigued and annoyed by Joab now because in siding with Adonijah he evokes in me the triumphant notion that he may be losing his touch and might at last overstep himself . Joab is worldly enough to take into account the possibility from which I myself recoil , that in the end I will prove partial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever to do with God , custom , or country . She gave me head . Whether it was good or not I ca n't judge ; I can only tell you it was good enough for me . She sat on top of me with her knees bent and rode back and forth with her face red as cherries . She hated Absalom when he stood before Solomon , and Amnon too , and I could tell she was glad when each was out of the way . Recollections of past delights mean much to me now . Unsettled scores chafe more each day . I must kill Joab soon for what he did to Absalom , and for what he did to my pride by killing Abner and Amasa , although I probably will have to counterfeit a different reason . I remember the sight of the runners with their messages from the battlefield . I knew they brought tidings of victory , for there were only two , and they were not part of a rout . Was my son Absalom safe ? " Blessed be the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who proved to be Ahimaaz , the goodly son of my other priest , Zadok , falling down to the earth upon his face before me , " which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king . " I knew that Ahimaaz the son of Zadok would not come running to me with news that was bad . " Is the young man Absalom safe ? " was the first question to come to E .... i 1 : . I h .. , i : . t i ,  | Why had two runners been sent ? I moved him aside , almost roughly , to make room for the other . " Tidings , my lord the king , " said Cushi , the second , " for the Lord avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee . " " Is the young man Absalom safe ? " I asked again , in a louder voice , feeling my confidence fail . And the messenger Cushi answered me , " The enemies of my lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do thee hurt , be as that young man is . " He was letting me know in a roundabout way that my son was dead . " 0 my son Absalom , " I wept with a loud and shattering grief I would not even try to subdue and made no effort to conceal . " 0 Absalom , my son , my son . " It was Joab who brought me around gruffly . He pulled no punches . " Thou lovest thy enemies , " he told me with hard contempt , in the chamber over the gate in which I had secluded myself . " And thou hatest thy friends , who put out their lives this day to save you from them . " What was I to do ? I put a brave face on the matter and went out to be seen by my servants . And once again , I wished Joab dead . Crazy as Saul in the unremitting enmity he bore toward me , I have wished Joab dead a thousand times before and since , prayed he 'd be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke or from a blow at the hand of some enemy in the field . A thousand times I have been disappointed . Dismayed as crazy Saul , I have been brought to the conclusion that I will have to prescribe the deed myself if I surely want it done . The son of a bitch will probably live forever if I do n't kill him soon . That will not be an easy thing to do . No one lusting for blood is ever innocent . Or satisfied . I have not been innocent . Or satisfied . Just as the man who wants silver will not be satisfied with silver , a man who wants the blood of another will not be satisfied with having that blood , nor the woman with jewels be satisfied with jewels , and the man who wants women will not be satisfied with women . Do n't try telling me different . Have n't I looked about me in the city and seen how all the labor of man is for the mouth , yet the appetite is not filled ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto Rank can tell you why . Wishes are granted , goals attained . But wants ? Forget them . They live as long as the person they inhabit . Only with Abigail 's crude churl of a husband did my wish for the death of someone come true in a timely fashion . Saul 's , youknow , took  | his house when Abigail returned after meeting with me . Abigail knew her comatose onion , and she waited till morning with the good news that destroyed him : I had spared his life . When he learned he had escaped being killed by my hand , the gross boor leaped to his feet with an exclamation of relief . Then he sank to the earth in a chilly sweat when he realized the close call he 'd had and how lucky a man he was . His heart seemed to die within him , and he became as a stone . About ten days later he was no longer alive . Here was a man who died of joy . " Blessed be the Lord , " I observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as wife . She said yes . She came with her damsels , and I learned from this poised and accomplished woman of Carmel how to live like a king . There is a difference between riches and opulence . I learned that when I was king , when I had all that I wanted , and kept wanting more . That was vanity . All that was vanity . " Oil and perfume make the heart glad , " Abigail taught me , seeing me happy and fulfilled in the tent with her . My palace ? Vanity . What 's wrong with vanity ? It does n't satisfy . HO CAN FIND a virtuous woman ? Her price is far above rubies . I know that from Abigail . She never let her lamp go out at night . She was good in discretion and beautiful in form . With her five winsome servants , she took care of the folding and raising of the tents wherever we pitched , and the tents she brought on the string of asses with which she had arrived to become my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her maidens while it was yet night to begin giving meat to her household , and in the morning they ground wheat and barley grain into flour on a saddle quern to bake fresh bread . Even while circling about daily to elude the hand of Saul , we ate each evening from a cloth of scarlet or a cloth of blue on a low wood table , and not from a piece of leather on the dirt floor , as I was accustomed to doing . We often had partridge and flagons of wine . There was always time to take our evening meal leisurely . We ate by candlelight . She was clean and particular about her person . She appeared to me always with her lips and cheeks rouged and her eyes colored with malachite , galena , or powdered lapis lazuli , a flowing picture of stately feminine grace each twilight , with a gold net for her hair and her beads of amber and crystal . She slept with a bundle of myrrh between her breasts , and I slept with her . She decked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other men about me noted with questioning disapproval that I tended to spend all night with her in the garden she made for me in her tent , every night . " If two lie together , " Abigail proved to me , " then they have heat . But how can one be warm alone ? " " How can one be warm alone ? " I have tried appealing to Bathsheba lately , designing sneakily to coax her onto my couch . " You have Abishag for that . " She refuses to budge . " That 's why they gave her to you . " Bathsheba manages very cozily for warmth with just her burning ambitions for herself and her son . Abigail was older than I and conceived very late . Well , we had no amniocentesis then , of course ; Chileab was born a mongoloid . We tried changing his name to Daniel in Chronicles , but that did n't help . Nothing helped . He remained a mongoloid , and he just sort of died away quietly after that . This remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children by Abigail . Even a girl might have been nice . To the end of her days , we would review with affection our years together and marvel at the nature of our coming together so happily through a fortuitous meeting , resulting in a marriage that seems to have been made in heaven . From the start , our conversations were amatory . " Sweet Abigail , make me immortal with a kiss , " I would request . " Stay with me until the day break , and the shadows flee away , " she would respond . She was afraid of the dark . But her voice was ever soft , an excellent thing in woman . " I wanted you that first day , " I boasted to her so many times in the relaxing talks we shared . " From the moment you bowed and looked up at me , and I had a clear look at your face . You are always so beautiful . " " I wanted you , " she never hesitated to admit . " I thought I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelet on my arm . " " I had to look somewhere . I could n't keep staring up into your eyes . " " I did n't want you to go back . " " I did n't want to . " " But I did n't want to force you . " " No , I would not have wanted to be forced . " " " That 's not my way . " " But I would want to know you were thinking of doing it . " " When Nahal died , I decided to propose to you the moment I heard : 111.111 if I wr.uta lift cat/ I wee Mari halt I wruatrin'e ? a. , t u , ee er.pra , "  | " I wanted to hear from you . From the moment he fell sick and was so close to death , that 's all I hoped for . If you did n't send for me , I was going to find some excuse for going back to see you again . " " I love you , Abigail . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of my other wives . " " Bathsheba ? " " Except Bathsheba . I do say it to Bathsheba , but it means something else . " " And I love you . But you know that , David . You still suffer so much , my dear , do n't you ? You never seem able to have much fun . " " I miss the child . " " I do too . " " I 'm sorry we could n't have more . I miss all my dead children . Especially the babies . " " Would you like some barley bread , darling , with lentils , figs , olive oil , and leeks ? " " No thank you , Abigail . I just had some . " Whosoever findeth a wife findeth a good thing . And I was so lucky with Abigail that I found fifteen , seven before I triumphed over Abner and his puppet Ishbosheth , and the rest in Jerusalem after I had taken the city from the Jebusites and made it my home and political headquarters . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic celebration the likes of which had never been seen before , and made the city a great religious center as well . Solomon the miser tells me seriously that he thinks he might want a thousand wives . " You need so many ? " I ask him , deadpan . Some of them would have to be for show . None of my other wives came close to Abigail in elegance , taste , and intelligence , although I loved Bathsheba with a heat that was greater . Shall I compare her to a summer 's day ? Why not ? She was so lovely and always more temperate . Ahinoam the Jezreelitess came next in the bridal succession and was with me too when I finally grew weary of running from Saul and crossed over into the service of the Philistines with all of my men and all of our households . Saul had already given my first wife , Michal , to Phalti the son of Laish . There was never much letup in Saul 's obsessive determination to hunt me down , despite the professions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of others yet  --  so loudly and tearfully after I had him defenseless on the floor of the cave at Engedi and allowed him to depart unharmed . I could have killed him then . I did n't . When I cut that piece from the skirt of his robe , I felt horribly as though I were cutting a strip .. ? Q ? rt . . v.m L .. I.umnn fvru.n " AAH Inr.I the .

" Saul called back , and lifted up his voice and wept . " Behold , my father , this day thine eyes can see how the Lord hath delivered thee today in my hand in the cave . I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not . I have not sinned against thee , yet thou huntest my soul to take it . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I , for thou hast rewarded me with good , whereas I have rewarded thee with evil . " He wept some more . It did my heart good to see him so remorseful . It was about time . " When the Lord had delivered me into thine hands , thou killedst me not . And now , behold , I know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand . " If I hear that one more time , I thought , I might begin to believe it . " Swear now therefore , " Saul continued , wiping his eyes with the back of his hand after another outpouring of tears , " that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house . " I swore unto Saul as he asked . It did no good .

I was disillusioned when I heard that Saul had set out after me again . My spies confirmed he was coming back into Judah , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him . I moved away to higher ground and witnessed him arriving at the place where we had been . They bedded down there for the night . " Who will go with me to Saul to the camp to see what is what ? " I asked the few nearest me . I took only Abishai . They had posted no watch . None there were awake . We moved about noiselessly . Things were unnaturally still , as though a deep slumber from the Lord had fallen upon them all . We found Saul lying in a trench , and his spear was stuck in the ground at his bolster . Abner and the other people had pitched nearby and lay sleeping round about him . Saul 's expression was haggard , his color sickly , he looked gaunt and soft . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along his neck down , to his collarbone . In a month he had aged ten years . He was snoring faintly , his breathing was regular . He moaned in his sleep .

Let him die when he would , 1 made un mu mind IM him on when rho 1 nrrl ramp to mitt I m whop  | the day did come for him to die , or when he descended into battle and perished . I wanted nothing to do with it . I took his spear and his cruse of water with me when I left , and this time I made my presence known with a taunting reproach for Abner , admonishing him contemptuously for his failure to post a guard about the king . Against Abner I had been accumulating grievances from the day we met . But first , of course , I prudently put a great space between us and was standing on the top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his three thousand . And David never had more than six hundred . " Answereth thou not , Abner ? " I jeered at the top of my voice through hands cupped about my mouth . " Art thou not a valiant man ?

" I replied in a voice dripping with scorn . " Ye are worthy to die , for ye have not kept your master , the king thy lord , the Lord 's anointed . This thing is not good that thou hast done , for there came one of the people in who could have destroyed him . And now see where the king 's spear is , and the cruse of water that was at his bolster . Let one of the young men come over and fetch them back . " By this time Saul had clambered to his feet , looking old . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was knotted up against the glare of the sun . " Is this thy voice ? " again I heard him call out in my direction , with deeper feeling this time , as though he had been pining for the sound and sight of only me . " Who then ? " I called back across the chasm between us . " My son David ? It 's really thy voice ? " " It is my voice , my lord , 0 king , my father . They do me wrong who have stirred thee up against me and say I seek to do thee harm . Behold again , I would not stretch forth my hand against thee . Last month it was the skirt of your robe . Today it 's your spear and cruse of water . How many more things must I take from you before you believe me ? The king of Israel is come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains . " Even at that late date , I still clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstantial misunderstanding , or the object of invidious slander . I could never believe for long that anybody ever really did want to kill me . Not even in battle . Not even Saul .

" I have sinned . " " You said it , " I concurred . " Behold , I have played the fool , " he cried , " and have erred exceedingly . " " Those are your words , not mine . " " For if a man find his enemy , " he reasoned , " will he let him go away ? " " Now you 've got it , " I assented , rubbing it in . " You 're catching on .

His redemption was whole , and it seemed there was now no stopping him . " Thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail . " " From thy mouth , " I assented , " unto God 's ears . " " Return thou now , my son David , " he urged , and went on to make a vow from the bottom of his heart , fervently saying , " for I swear before God that I will no more do thee harm . " Bullshit ! I decided from the bottom of mine , and determined on the spot that there was nothing better for me to do than to escape speedily into the land of the Philistines if I did not wish to perish one day by the hand of Saul . A living dog is better than a dead lion , and he who fights and runs away , may live to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I arose and passed over safely into Gath with the six hundred men that were with me , every man with his household , me with my two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife when he lived . Achish gave me the city of Ziklag in the south and all of the territory surrounding it . And this was the end of my troubles with Saul . He sought no more again for me , once it was told him where I had fled . We dwelt in the country of the Philistines a full year and , four months , and then Saul was dead , perishing against the Philistines in the great battle of Gilboa . As though drawn inflexibly toward the goal of his own destruction , he fought them head-on ; I would have allowed them entry into the valley of Jezreel and then swept down upon them from the rear and the flanks . I beat them for good at Rephaim by surrounding them at night through the mulberry trees . Saul knew the results beforehand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before in the hideous revelation he unfolded in the house of the witch of F:ndor . Ghosts do n't I , .

When Saul saw the great size of the host of the Philistines against whom he had come to do battle , he was afraid  --  I do n't blame him , because I was with them for a day and a half and was awed by their number ? and his heart trembled . Mine knocked about in my chest for a few minutes when the other four kings spotted me with Achish and gave vent to the belief that I was there to turn traitor against them once the fight had begun . All they did , thank God , was send me away . Saul lost confidence , was stumped . He asked for an omen . The Lord answered him not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In numb desperation , he sent to inquire and went in disguise for foreknowledge to the witch of Endor , elevating himself above the ban he had placed upon wizards and all others with access to familiar spirits . Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live , says Exodus , and Saul had endeavored to cut all wizards and witches off from the land . Now he was glad to go underground and felt lucky to find one . He put on other raiment and stole away to the woman by night with two companions he trusted . " Double , double , toil , and trouble , " the witch at Endor greeted him . She became hysterical when she guessed who he was . " Why hast thou deceived me ? " Saul mollified her , promised there would be no penalty if she would just dredge up Samuel for him to talk to . The ghost of the prophet came up at her beckoning , covered with a mantle . When Saul recognized it was indeed Samuel , he stooped with his face to the ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who loomed before him like a stern and mournful statue . True to form , Samuel said , " What do you want ? " Saul replied , " The Philistines make war against me , and God is departed and answereth me no more . Please tell me the future . " " You do n't want to know . " " Who will triumph in the battle tomorrow ? " " Do n't ask . " " What will happen to me ? " " It should n't happen to a dog . " And then Samuel gave it to him . " Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me . The Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines . " Saul would die , his sons would die , the Philistines would win , and we would lose . We ? I was n't even there . And if I had been , I would have  | people . Things worked out perfectly for me . I never would have won the allegiance of Israel if I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legitimate heirs died and his army was shattered and dispersed ? the people forsook the cities and fled , like harts that find no pasture , and the Philistines came and dwelt in them . Even as it is , I 've always had trouble keeping the people of Israel in line . My men and I responded with fervor when Achish summoned us to make war . We mobilized speedily and came up from Ziklag to Gath to do battle for him and the other Philistine chieftains at Gilboa . We were tough and willing . We were filled with excitement and expectation , we 'd been spoiling for a real fight against those who 'd been hounding us , and we were impatient for the impending climax that would at last bring one kind of resolution or another to the tension and hostility that had raged so long between Saul and myself and had made exiles and pariahs of me and my men . We were part of the army of Achish , and we marched under his banner all the way north up to Shunem near Gilboa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philistines . I never saw so many troops . We should have anticipated that I and my band of Hebrews would attract some notice . We certainly did stand out . The princes of the Philistines drew near to look . I was identified , and I began to my horror to hear again those marvelous and euphonic words in the laudatory refrain about me and Saul that by this time I had come to dread . " Is not this David ? " wondered the other princes of the Philistines , huddling closer and ogling me , " of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying Saul slew his thousands , and David his ten thousands ? " If ever I am remembered , it undoubtedly will be for that . It goes without saying that Achish told the truth . My men were disgruntled and talked of stoning me when the princes of the Philistines refused to allow us to be near at the time of battle and ordered us back down . " Let him not go into battle with us , " they resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to be an adversary to us . " That was that . My men talked again of stoning me when we returned to Ziklag and discovered that a tribe of Amelekites had smitten the city in our absence and taken as captives all of our wives and daughters and sons , and all of our animals . Abigail was gone and so was Ahinoam . I was brokenhearted . They were ready to kill me . I inquired of God and was advised to go after this troop that had invaded the south and carried away our people . " Pursue , " said God , " for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover all niviitivrly without fail "
