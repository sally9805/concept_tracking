Budget-conscious oenophiles have long admired Chile 's moderately priced , eminently drinkable wines . Despite their relatively unsophisticated technology , Chilean vintners have consistently produced supple reds that are notable for fruit and balance , as well as soft but less distinctive whites . The Wine Spectator , the leading American journal of wines and spirits , last year gave an impressive 88 ( on a scale of 100 ) and a best-buy rating to Vina Los Vascos ' 1984 Cabernet Sauvignon , which sells in the U.S. for a mere $5 . Other bargain-priced Chilean wines , including Concha y Toro and St. Morillon , have also scored well in U.S. tastings . <P> With such gung-ho scouting reports , it was only a matter of time before the big leaguers moved in . After two years of negotiations , Les Domaines des Barons de Rothschild , the firm that manages France 's prestigious Chateau Lafite-Rothschild , has purchased a half interest in Los Vascos , a 500-acre vineyard located some 90 miles southwest of Santiago . French experts are already working on this year 's vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domaines , promises that " 1989 , which is currently being harvested , should be better yet . " <P> Details of the deal were not disclosed , but it was probably a bargain by French standards : prime vineyards in Chile sell for $4,000 to $6,000 an acre , compared with as much as $400,000 in France 's Bordeaux region . The country has a host of grape-hospitable regions whose weather remains remarkably stable from year to year . Chilean grapevines , of mostly transplanted French and some German stock , are unscathed by the Phylloxera that devastated Californian and European vines in the 19th century . With an annual output of some 70 million gal. , Chile ranks 13th among the world 's wine producers . Los Vascos , with a yearly capacity of 423,000 gal. , is unusual among the country 's vineyards in that most of its wines are exported to the U.S. , Canada , England , Denmark and , yes , France .
