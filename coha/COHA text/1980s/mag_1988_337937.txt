For two years a debate has raged at Stanford University and reverberated through scores of other schools over a question that could set new directions for American higher education . The issue : Should students be required to read a fixed core of works on Western civilization , and , if so , what should be in it ? The heart of the dispute at Stanford has been whether to amend or remove from the university 's freshman Western culture courses a roster of 15 prescribed classics . Many scholars regard those works , ranging from Homer and Dante to Darwin and Freud , as part of a sacred canon . But revisionists , including many blacks , Hispanics and women , want to build a new , theme-based program rather too cleverly called CIV ( short for Culture , Ideas and Values ) . <P> " Nobody is questioning the value of continuing to teach the great works of Western culture , " insists CIV Proponent Thomas Wasow , dean of undergraduate studies . The fear that just such a question was being raised , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Bennett . A devout classicist , he accused Stanford 's revisionists of " academic intimidation , " claiming that a " very vocal minority is attempting to overpower a less vocal majority . " Dismantling the core curriculum , he warned , amounted to " trashing Plato and Shakespeare . " <P> Last week Stanford 's faculty senate voted 39-4 for a compromise revision of their canon . This fall the original 15 books , all of them written by white , Western males , will be pared down . Out goes Homer , as well as Darwin and Dante . The six new requirements are unspecified works from Plato , the Bible , St. Augustine , Machiavelli , Rousseau and Marx . Next year Stanford 's Western Culture Program will be formally replaced by CIV . All freshmen will read works " from at least one " non-European source chosen by the professor , who is required to give " substantial attention to issues of race , gender and class . " <P> Faculty members point out that the new list , which was never meant to be exhaustive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the emphasis of different CIV teachers . Yet the compromise is a clear signal that Stanford intends to recognize the essential pluralism of Western civilization  --  in literary as well as social terms . The major remaining question is how far professors will go in bringing the study of women and minorities into CIV courses . <P> All the way , if hard-core revisionists are able to suit the word to the action . " We want the idea of a canon eliminated , " insists William King , 21 , chairman of Stanford 's Black Student Union . " The idea that there could be a core list is Eurocentric and biased . " Similar opinions are heard at other schools . At Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville , N.Y. , Professor Arnold Krupat declares flatly that there is nothing sacred or broadly cultured about any such canon . In fact , he claims , the idea " is almost exclusively Wasp , male and East Coast . "
