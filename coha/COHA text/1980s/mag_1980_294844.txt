Joni Eareckson 's special ministry for the disabled <P> " What really annoys me is this attitude many people have that your life does n't count if you do n't have a successful job , you 're not married or are not physically attractive . There 's a cheapness about the value of human life in our society that often shows itself in the way many folks treat handicapped people . " These are sharp words , especially coming from a young woman who is a successful commercial artist , a bestselling author and the star of a two-hour , $2 million film version of her life that is being shown all over the U.S. <P> Joni ( pronounced Johnny ) Eareckson does n't surfer the kind of deformity that causes people to point or stare . With her pretty girl-next-door looks , radiant smile , and pert , no-nonsense personality , she is a popular speaker on the Evangelical Protestant celebrity circuit and to nonreligious groups . As she readily admits , she is treated better than most of her fellow disabled Americans . But Joni Eareckson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The summer after she graduated as the " Most Athletic Girl " at a suburban Baltimore high school , she broke her neck in a 1967 diving accident . " Somebody has to bathe me and brush my hair and feed me , " she says . " In a sense , success for me is just getting up in the morning , looking at that wheelchair and saying , ' Yeah , it 's still here . ' " <P> During her first months in the hospital , she was so helpless that she could not even do what she longed to do-take her own life . She begged a girlfriend to do it for her several times , but the friend refused . Encased in a canvas Stryker frame , Eareckson felt life was meaningless . " All those yardsticks for success that had come to mean so much to me were shattered-being pretty and popular , dating the right guys . " The first time she went shopping for clothes , " they just hung on me like a sack . " After waves of depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually came back to a deepened version of the orthodox Christianity in which she had been raised . <P> During years of tough rehabilitation , she taught herself to draw and paint , holding a pen or a brush between her teeth . Then came the speaking tours and writing , in which she uses her own faith to encourage the despairing and disabled . Last year she organized a national " ministry to those who suffer " called Joni and Friends . Based in Woodland Hills , Calif. , it offers both spiritual and practical advice to as many as 2,000 letter writers each week . <P> During 1981 , the United Nations ' International Year of Disabled Persons , Eareckson 's group will expand seminars to prod Americans into doing more to help this neglected minority . Eareckson consciously puts what she calls " the celebrity thing " to good use in this crusade . " Friends who are disabled look on me as a bridge between themselves and the able-bodied population who , for the most part , would n't give them the time of day .
