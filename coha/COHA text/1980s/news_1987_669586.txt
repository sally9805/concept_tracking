Yet across the country , traffic is unexpectedly light at many of the Immigration and Naturalization Service ' s 107 legalization centers for undocumented aliens seeking amnesty under last year ' s immigration reform . More than one month into the one-year application period that began May 5 , some offices that were staffed for up to 300 applicants a day are processing much smaller numbers. // // The INS has estimated that at least 2 million illegal aliens nationally will apply for amnesty . But through June 10 , only 100 , 858 undocumented aliens had submitted applications. // By last week , just 1 , 100 people had applied throughout Arizona . Fewer than 50 applications had been taken in St. Louis , even though demographic reports suggest that there are as many as 15 , 000 eligible applicants in the area ; INS had expected to process 50 applications a day there . Even in southern California , where there are 13 legalization offices and , by some estimates , almost half the country ' s illegal aliens , just over 10 , 000 applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwhelmed with the turnout , ' ' says George Newman , a lawyer in Clayton , Mo. , a St. Louis suburb . He and many of his colleagues and other legalization workers say too-strict regulations , unclear documentation requirements , and a failure to reach many illegals are causing the low turnout . ' ' What we see happening is nothing the immigration lawyers didn ' t expect , ' ' he adds. // In Houston ' s office , however , things are different . More than 5 , 000 aliens filed applications by June 10 . Over 98 percent of those have received initial approval and have been sent on to the INS regional office in Dallas . More than 55 , 000 applications have been distributed. // ' ' There is an absolute flood ( of applicants ) , ' ' says F.S. Halim , a Houston immigration lawyer . ' ' I went down to the center with a client during the day and couldn ' t even get in , ' ' he adds . Last week he ended up waiting in line with several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parra for the district ' s high turnout , noting that he has worked hard to educate the alien community about the legalization program and to convince them that , in the Houston district at least , the INS wants to be on their side. // Between January and the opening of legalization offices , Mr. Parra held more than 120 legalization workshops with illegal aliens , immigration lawyers , and the private organizations approved by the INS to help aliens complete their applications . He held one seminar exclusively for the heads of the 56 consulates in Houston , and also worked closely with the Houston news media , including the ethnic press. // Gordon Quan , a Houston immigration lawyer , recalls how Parra made sure that one illegal alien with an airtight application went through early on May 5 and came out with a temporary work permit . The alien - holding his new card - was featured on the evening news and the front page of the next morning ' s newspapers . ' ' That right there reassured a lot of potential applicants that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parra , who came from New Orleans last July , says he found a community where ' ' a huge credibility gap had created a deep distrust of INS among aliens . ' ' He says he has worked hard to ' ' put the word ' service ' back in our name , ' ' and to ' ' get out and make ( us ) personal. // ' ' I ' ve really tried to stress that here , ' ' he adds , referring not only to amnesty applications but to more-conventional immigration cases as well . ' ' I tell our employees , ' Behind every one of these files is a person - let ' s treat them with that dignity. ' ' ' // That attitude has paid off in the amnesty program . Parra says he hopes to increase the staff in the legalization office by nearly 50 percent to accommodate the applicants . In addition , a mobile unit to help cover the Houston district ' s 30 counties will begin operation in early July. // Higher-than-expected turnout has also prompted the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours. // But generally around the country , response has been slow . Duke Austin , an INS spokesman in Washington , says applications are ' ' picking up ' ' after the slow start , however , and that INS still expects about 2 million aliens to receive amnesty. // Critics of the program say it will be in trouble , however , unless publicity increases , and some of what immigration lawyers are calling ' ' picky ' ' regulations are changed. // ' ' The public education effort has been slow at best , ' ' says Rick Swartz , president of the National Immigration , Refugee , and Citizenship Forum in Washington . ' ' There ' s been nothing to try to reach the undocumented community. ' ' // Mr. Swartz says he also believes that many cases are being ' ' sat on ' ' because of uncertainty about how much documentation is needed . INS has notified some of the private agencies helping aliens with their applications that they are being too careful and asking for too much documentation , he adds. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' says Roger Wolf , a lawyer in Tucson , Ariz. , ' ' because we have no minimum guidelines as to what ' s acceptable . The tendency then is to go with the maximum , which is every piece of paper in the house. ' ' // Swartz says his organization and others will meet with INS officials later this month to see how the process can be standardized and simplified. // Still , many immigration lawyers say some of the INS regulations , or the way they are being interpreted , will have to change if the numbers of applicants is to increase greatly. // ' ' Every time in the regulatory process that the Immigration Service has been confronted with a choice between a liberal interpretation or a conservative one - one that would cut out a large number of people - they ' ve consistently taken the second route , ' ' says attorney Newman. // He points , for example , to the regulation that says aliens who entered the country legally but overstayed their visa and became illegal had to be ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word ' ' government ' ' in federal regulations has always been interpreted as the US government . But immigration is interpreting the word to specify the INS , an interpretation that could deny amnesty to thousands. // How the program treats families that would be split by a strict interpretation of regulations is another concern for immigration advocates. // They note in addition that an AIDS-testing plan announced last week by Attorney General Edwin Meese III could add another bottleneck to the legalization program . Under that plan , all immigrants seeking to enter the United States and all undocumented aliens applying for legal residency would be tested for AIDS . Immigrants testing positive for the disease would be denied entry into the US , while illegal aliens already here who tested positive would be denied legal status. // //
