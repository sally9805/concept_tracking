Violence , brutality and intimidation mar a gory electoral contest <P> It is an election that Africa will long remember . It has been marked by political violence , brutality and intimidation , perhaps the worst in the history of the continent 's turbulent independence movements . During the two-month campaign in Zimbabwe Rhodesia , there have been 250 deaths and more than 207 declared violations of the cease-fire agreement painstakingly hammered out at London 's Lancaster House conference last fall . <P> The gory contest comes to a merciful close this week with the election of 80 black members to the 100-seat House of Assembly . Voting separately , the country 's 212,000 whites have already chosen their 20 representatives-all of them members of former Prime Minister Ian Smith 's Rhodesian Front Party . <P> The election , which will determine the government of a future Zimbabwe , seemed in danger of disintegrating during the final days . The last full week of campaigning was marred by hundreds of scattered incidents , including the murder of a Roman Catholic priest and the abduction of four campaign workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his erstwhile ally Robert Mugabe . <P> Violence reached such an alarming level that Lord Soames , the British caretaker Governor , issued a map showing " red " and " blue " zones in which he adjudged that it was " impossible " or " difficult " for parties other than Mugabe 's to campaign because of intimidation by his guerrilla forces ( acronymically called ZANLA ) . At least 2,000 of Mugabe 's men have refused to enter the 14 cease-fire assembly points set aside for guerrillas returning to Zimbabwe Rhodesia from camps in neighboring states . <P> Former Prime Minister Bishop Abel Muzorewa , the leading black moderate , was still gamely electioneering around the country in a red-and-white-striped helicopter , accompanied by a dozen armed bodyguards . Generously financed by South African and Rhodesian corporations , Muzorewa runs by far the richest and best organized of all the major parties . Despite offers of free drinks and gifts , however , his crowds remained small and glumly suspicious of the proceedings . Muzorewa charged last week that he had attended " only one meeting where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also complained of heavy intimidation-from both the Mugabe forces and some 20,000 armed " auxiliaries " loyal to Muzorewa . Nor was Mugabe himself exempt from intimidation : as the election neared , he had all but withdrawn from active campaigning following a grenade attack on his new suburban Salisbury home and a remote-controlled land-mine explosion that just missed his car . <P> As bad as the campaign looked , it was still peace by Rhodesian standards : the average daily death toll was seven-down from 40 before the settlement . Privately , many black nationalists admitted that Soames ' firmness had helped hold the cease-fire on course . But Soames has also been severely criticized by the nationalists and their African sympathizers for his seeming partiality toward the white Rhodesians , whom he has allowed to control the country 's civil service , government apparatus , security forces and pro-Muzorewa auxiliaries .
