Since October the hungriest shark in the corporate sea has been swimming gradually smaller circles around California 's Unocal , the 14th largest U.S. oil company ( 1984 sales : $11.5 billion ) . Corporate Raider T. Boone Pickens started buying into the company 's stock , insisting at first that he intended to make only a modest investment . Pickens confirmed last week that his appetite has grown . The Mesa Petroleum chairman announced that his investor group , which now holds 13.6% of Unocal , is seriously considering an effort to gain control of the company . Pickens ' group last week asked Unocal to postpone its annual shareholders meeting , scheduled for April 29 , by two months so the Texas oilman could assemble his own slate of directors to run against the current board . Unocal curtly refused . <P> The company could be the toughest quarry to date for Pickens and his partners , who have made assaults on Gulf , Cities Service and Phillips that yielded before-tax profits of about $880 million . Unocal has girded for the assault with a battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fred Hartley , vows he will fight rather than buy off Pickens with greenmail . Stay tuned .
