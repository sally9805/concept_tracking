Lights discover the PERFORMER seated , back to audience , before a low makeup table with a large triptych mirror that shows her triple reflection to the audience  --  tile surface , Arabic motifs , a clutter of toiletries and makeup paraphernalia . She has previously put up her hair , blocked out her eyebrows and put on alcohol . Now she attaches an elastic headband and applies the six tapes requisite for an onstage face-lift . Then she applies liquid base . Her voice is amplified . Three closeups of the PERFORMER appear in the three planes of the triptych mirror . The effect is achieved by the placement of color video monitors behind one-way mirrors connected to three cameras in a reverse studio configuration  --  three closed-circuit systems functioning simultaneously . PERFORMER speaks simultaneously to herself and to her reflections.I haveNothing toHide SHE appears to blow out the images as if they were candles and repeatsI haveNothing toHide while reaching for eyeliner , which is in a set of nine colors mounted in a plastic display case .

The image floats across all three mirror/monitors like a dream or memory  --  sound of wind and distant sheep bleating . The PERFORMER 'S memories are shown , as here , by prerecorded imagery on tape that is patched into the closed-circuit systems at the appropriate times . The live , closed-circuit camera work then stands for her mentation and associations in the present , as distinct from the prerecorded , taped sequences , which elucidate her memories and daydreams from the past . Over the image of the child , SHE saysThe day before yesterdayThe truth put me to sleepA hailstorm on my fingersDid not wake me , norA light shining in my eye A distant phrase of Al Adan Al Charhi , the Arabic call to prayer , is heard.The prophet of loss sangToo faintly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then from the reverse profile  --  pan across the mirrors .

We see mysterious and lyric views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in motion  --  on roads and in an open field  --  snow on the ground . Once , we see a close shot of a hunting rifle on the truck seat and the PERFORMER lying by it superimposed . SHE reaches for the gun . Suddenly , the sound of thunder . The truck and its occupants  --  the PERFORMER as a CHILD , and an adult  --  perhaps her father  --  are traveling . The journey has spiritual overtones , a pilgrimage of sorts . The CHILD , riding , speaks to the camera in closeup.I sing of you , Alex , who I killed ( of course I did ) And thank you , dear The PERFORMER joins the CHILD , lips synching. &nbsp; for every fantasy I reaped &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And curse you , cuntI owe you money You 've been dead for half my life . You areMy half life , love ; you date my art The CHILD 'S voice drops out , leaving the PERFORMER 'S voice post-synchronizing the image of the CHILD . SHE is now dressed identically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the truck . An old patchwork quilt around her shoulders , blonde wig , facelift with youthful-seeming base and coloration , the same orange bandana the CHILD wears in the image . HER voice seeks to recreate the CHILD 'S phrasing.I see my art in the green glow of radiumAlways less by half ; I see this gameAs cute as archaeology &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm gon na pay youBaby , watch me dig you upAnd stuff it up your anus magnusWatch me write this &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sing of you Over an image of the truck receding into the twilight  --  country desolate , winter road  --  the PERFORMER 'S face ( live , closed-circuit ) is superimposed on the prerecorded sky .

SHE spins as a Dervish and simultaneously , mimetically drives the truck like a child playing with a steering wheel . Vocally , SHE roars as the motor which , electronically altered , appears to become a blood-curdling scream . The onrushing truck swerves off the road and careens into the mouth of a mountain cave like the opening of an Egyptian tomb . And the screens go black . The sound of a deluge of rain , an echoing gunshot  --  echoing like the thunder . The image of rain splattering over a rock . In the rock , the PERFORMER 'S face superimposed  --  weeping . SHE mournsIf I sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet me , conquerer of Asia ? Put your money &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where your mouth was In the center of the triptych a memory image : the truck in a blizzard of snow . The CHILD , under the quilt , struggling home to an old weathered farm house . Inside , the CHILD held in the FATHER 'S arms , being rocked to sleep , speaks as if in a dream.If only I can talk to you , Ali &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lovingly The PERFORMER , on closed-circuit in the side mirror/screens , looking like the CHILD , appears to hold herself in her own arms in the same position . They continue speaking together.Here in the moon-blanched kitchen of my dreamingPowder snow blowing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a genie gustOr in the bathtub of my memory lit by nostalgia 's candlesShadows of cats on the shadowy walls chasing shadows of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mice on the ceilingIf I can talk to you with a tongue fresh lickedBy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betterBled of pride A blackout  --  all video goes dead .

SHE changes her makeup , wig , costume and character to that of a woman , half martyr , half whore  --  strangely like the CHILD decayed . SHE completes her makeup with the insertion of three bejeweled teeth fitting over her own . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are the oneI ca n't pay off ; I ca n't put off your bill untilThe day after tomorrow when I score(I 'll score for more the day I eulogize my owing ) Unhappily , you 're through .

An ear tick tick tickTo the geiger counter of obsession , earTo decay  --  the half life that fits the half life &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me half you The PERFORMER 'S face in color , superimposed over the black-and-white portraits of the old men , appears to search them out while speaking .

Makeup table glows  --  infernal light , smoke . Blinding herself with the flashlight , SHE searches for and finds the bier ( the table ) and mounts it . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SpeculationThat I find your grave by matchlightIn the winter . Fog lights on the river iceI ca n't believe my eyes ; the glow of amberGlow of fire flowing underneath .

SHE lifts it . Under it , appearing on all three monitors , is a lifelike latex mask of Alex Lujak , lying on the dark background of the tiled surface like a death mask . SHE sits down on the table and prepares to put the mask on . As SHE speaks , her amplified voice changes register electronically till her range and texture is that of an old man . As SHE speaks , SHE sheds the vestiges of the woman  --  earrings , wig , jeweled teeth.Alexander Lujak was seventy-oneWhen he killed himself with a deer rifleIn the bedroom of his home . It was rainingHis daughters had left himOne for a black man , the other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an irrigation ditchHe left the churchTwenty-eight years later a second sonChildless , had had himself vasectomizedWhich terminated descent through the male lineHis wife , Nettie , havingUndergone shock treatmentsWas now institutionalizedThe previous year he had sufferedA pulmonary edema and had actually diedFor sixty seconds . In the last monthsTry as he may he could not stop smoking The PERFORMER puts on the mask and assumes the character of Alex Lujak . The memory , in prerecorded video images , of Alex and his daughter preparing to journey by truck accompanies the narration . Twice , a closeup of the PERFORMER in the mask of Alex appears superimposed over an image of trapped water moving under a sheet of ice.Despite his Polish name he was a CroatBorn in Ruma , Yugoslavia , July 6 , 1912The second of four , he emigrated with his parentsTo a small farm near Cleveland , OhioMarried in 1937 , with a grammar school educationHe worked in a steel mill during the second World WarContracting , as a result , severe bronchiectasic , His lungs inflamed and weakened From inhaling small bits of steelHe set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled in the backFor the clean air of the desert aroundPhoenix , Arizona &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Taking with him &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His daughter , age eight &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For company &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He arranged theFamily furniture in the back of the truckJust as it had been in her room at homeSo she would not be afraid to go to sleepWhen they stopped by the side of the road The memory imagery shows the truck pulling off the road and entering the crypt-like cave that we saw earlier through the windshield of the careening truck before the sound of the gunshot . The truck in the enormous cave  --  like the entrance to a mine  --  travels with its lights on . Then stops by a rock wall . The FATHER , his face never once seen , lifts the sleeping CHILD from the cab and puts her in her own bed in the back of the truck . We see the arrangement of the furniture as has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the deer rifle and prepare to sit up all night guarding the CHILD  --  tapping the gun strangely with his fingernail . Slowly , we pull back to show FATHER , CHILD , gun and room inside the truck inside the grave . The PERFORMER in the mask continues to speak with an old man 's voice , but subtly it starts to change and evolve back into her own.Late in life , with doubts and fearsAs to the wisdom of his actionsAfter a son was born and theFather and the daughter were estrangedHe gave to her a sum of moneyAs a loan  --  for him so great a sumThat the amount was never mentioned in the homeIt was spoken of as forty dollarsAs one speaks of forty days and nightsOf flooding , or of wandering for forty years &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately , fate conspired &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To prevent repayment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before death intervened &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Died afraid of being cheated The PERFORMER 'S voice is now completely her own . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O primitive man &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hunter , Fisher &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gatherer of spare parts &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who dies not of love &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dies of shameI love this roomI want to die in this roomAnd I would , had not I hadThe need to do you &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poetic justiceHad not I owed youThis guarding of your dying , nowThe way you guarded , then &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My **26;2363;TOOLONG I sing of you , AlexWho I killed , ( of course I did ) You are the death that sets my living freeYou are my impossibility The electronically created old man 's voice suddenly takes over again . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love this room &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I would , had not I heard &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This call to pilgrimage &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This knot of God in my throat &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drop of God on my eyelash &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This deep dreaming home &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where you 're waiting dancing The PERFORMER in the mask dances the dance of pilgrimage against the " rain of memory " in the mirrors to the ecstatic music of the end of The Mawlid-Invocation of the Divine Name . At the conclusion of the dance , SHE faces the audience and rips the latex mask in half . Half remains clinging to her face . Half SHE throws down . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want to kill and love &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the identical motion &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the identical word &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one impossible thing , but twoOut of not one impossible need , but twoCalled not one impossible name , but twoI am not one impossible one , but two Here in the dark box of my throat I bring you back to lifeI rip you off SHE rips off the remaining portion of the mask . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for all to seeJust how alive a corpse can beIn my body , AlexanderYour charmed bonesTake on a certain glow The PERFORMER returns to the dressing table , puts on her robe and puts cold cream on her checks . &nbsp; You ca n't leave me ; that plan has a flaw &nbsp; We 'll never sort each other 's atoms out &nbsp; We are under sentence of a Boyle 's law &nbsp; For hope 's dispersal in chambers of doubt The lights go out .
