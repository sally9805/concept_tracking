Mixed signals , or a stunning change of mind <P> " I now put to the vote the draft resolution contained in document S/13827 , " said Donald Mills , the slim , elegant Ambassador from Jamaica who was serving as the United Nations Security Council president . After the members raised their hands , he announced the result : " Fifteen votes in favor , none against , no abstentions . " U.S. Ambassador Donald McHenry then proudly addressed the meeting . " My delegation is pleased , " he said , " that the council has spoken unanimously on this important issue . " The occasion was indeed historic . For the first time , the U.S. had supported a Security Council resolution sharply criticizing Israel . <P> Or had it ? Two days later , President Carter issued an astounding statement . The U.S. vote in favor of the resolution , which demanded that Israel both stop its practice of placing new settlements in the Arab lands it has occupied since 1967 and dismantle nearly 100 already in existence , had been a mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... clearly . " Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , poker-faced , said curtly : " I take full responsibility for what happened . " <P> But what had happened ? How could the skilled diplomatic bureaucracy of a superpower mull over a highly sensitive document for nearly a month , scrutinizing each word , and then cast its vote in error ? Because of a communications gap between Washington and its U.N . Ambassador in New York ? Or between the President and his Secretary of State ? Carter 's explanation was not only lame but incredible . With one swift stroke , he had destroyed the growing notion , so carefully cultivated in this election year , of acting calmly and shrewdly on foreign policy matters . <P> Seldom in recent years has the U.S. been subjected to so much scorn and ridicule . In Israel , the Knesset formally rejected the U.N . resolution , which Premier Menachem Begin described as " repugnant and unjustified . " American Jewish publications , reflecting Israeli opinion , were unimpressed by Carter 's disavowal . Brooklyn 's Jewish Press charged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action as a " stab in the back " to all of its readers . Reporting Carter 's reversal , Saudi Arabia 's state-controlled radio said acidly : " May God have mercy on his soul . " The Kuwait daily Al-Anba called the President " a coward and a puppet in the hands of Israel . " " Instant amateurism , " snapped a British diplomat . A German colleague described the " incredible flip-flopping " as " intolerable . " <P> Idaho Democrat Frank Church , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , launched an investigation to get at the facts of the sorry episode . As TIME correspondents dug into those facts last week , two things seemed clear : 1 ) Carter and Vance had failed to agree precisely on just what phrasing the U.S. would or would not accept in the resolution , and 2 ) annoyed by Israel 's seeming violation of the spirit of the Camp David peace agreement , Carter almost surely would have let the U.S. vote stand had he not been in the midst of a race for reelection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Jewish voters in such important primary-election states as New York , Florida , Illinois and California .
