Reagan makes his case , but G. O.P. candidates may have trouble making theirs <P> Now it gets serious . With less than two weeks to go before the mid-term election , the preliminary sparring is over , and the candidates are trading their heavy punches . The prize is a big one : preservation or destruction of the conservative coalition that has enabled President Ronald Reagan to put most of his programs through Congress . <P> As always in an election that is really an aggregation of state and local votes , the candidates are debating a thousand points of personality and parochial concerns . But on every husting , one national issue is dominating all others : the state of the recession-ridden economy , and especially the 10.1% unemployment rate . Democrats everywhere are seeking to pin the blame for double-digit unemployment squarely on Reagan . On national TV , the President last week took the issue headon , an action he had been avoiding . In a sober address from the Oval Office that was considerably more effective than his stump speeches on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his concern , argued that his policies are slowly bringing the nation out of an economic mess created mostly by his predecessors , and stressed his Administration 's accomplishments in reducing inflation ( now 5.1% , down from 12.4% in 1980 ) . <P> Which side are the voters inclined to believe ? The answer , so far as it can be deduced from a Yankelovich , Skelly &; White poll for TIME , is that troubled voters are skeptical about accepting either view as gospel , but on balance the results are worrisome for Republicans . While most voters still absolve Reagan of responsibility for the nation 's economic distress , they are not so indulgent toward his party . <P> The electorate is clearly worried . Almost 60% of the registered voters interviewed across the country judged the nation to be " in deep and serious trouble , " vs. only 38% who thought the difficulties are no worse now than at other times . By 47% to 39% , they considered rising unemployment more troublesome than continued inflation . That is an almost exact reversal of a poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 38% about unemployment . * <P> But when asked where to place the blame for climbing jobless rates , 46% of those polled answered : " The situation Reagan inherited . " Even 34% of the registered Democrats interviewed chose that response . Only 33% of the total put the responsibility on " Reagan and his policies . " Some 61% said they personally were economically worse off than they had been when Reagan took office . Even so , 57% thought the President had generally put the nation on " the right track . " <P> Moreover , Reagan seems to have weathered without serious damage the decisive psychological blow of the Government 's announcement on Oct. 8 that the September jobless rate had really crossed the symbolic 10% mark . Although the Yankelovich interviews were conducted by telephone Oct. 5-7 , the firm repolled last week and found that the opinions on Reagan and the economy had not significantly changed .
