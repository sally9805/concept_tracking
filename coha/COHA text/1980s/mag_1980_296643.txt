He has one eye on the fall <P> One of Ronald Reagan 's most difficult problems last week was acting as though he were still in a race for the Republican presidential nomination . The Californian continued to pile up delegates in primaries , swamping George Bush in Indiana , North Carolina and Tennessee ; Bush carried only the District of Columbia , where Reagan was not on the ballot . Altogether the Californian won more than 100 of the 140 delegates at stake , raising his total to about 850 , to only 180 for Bush . Reagan needs only about 150 more delegates to be assured of being nominated on the first ballot at the convention , and he could win them before the concluding round of primaries on June 3 . Said Reagan , joshing coyly with reporters : " It will be very difficult for me to say any more that I 'm cautiously optimistic . I 'm just optimistic . " <P> Bush 's strategy now amounts to no more than a desperate hope that he can sweep all the remaining primaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon and Reagan 's native California-and that the shock of such a wholesale upset would cause delegates already committed to Reagan to switch to Bush . Nonetheless , Bush refuses to drop out . In fact , last week he named former Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski to monitor spending by independent conservative campaign committees that help Reagan . Bush is not charging that there has been any illegal activity , but wants Jaworski to watch for any signs that there might be . <P> To Reagan 's staff , the Bush campaign has dwindled from a challenge to a minor irritant . Says Reagan Campaign Manager William Casey : " Bush is a drain on our time and attention . " But for the sake of party unity in the fall , Reagan refuses to put pressure on Bush to quit . Says Reagan : " That 's a decision only he can make . " <P> Reagan 's staffers would prefer to be working full time on their most urgent task : preparing for the campaign against Jimmy Carter . For example , Reagan 's personal campaign organization eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the 50 states , but that can not be completed as long as the nomination is still being contested . Nevertheless , Reagan 's men are making some planning progress . They have been in touch with the Republican National Committee , which last week chose former President Gerald Ford to make a convention speech on opening night . Reagan and his aides believe that a plea for the party to close ranks will have strong impact coming from the man who beat Reagan in the bitter 1976 campaign . <P> Reagan 's aides are also beginning to make serious plans for selection of a vice-presidential candidate . They have agreed on one prime qualification : because of Reagan 's age ( 69 ) , the choice must be someone whom voters would take seriously as a potential President . No formal " short list " has been drawn up , but some staffers say that when one is , it will probably include Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker and Bush , whose primary victories in Massachussetts and Pennsylvania demonstrated strength in the industrial Northeast that Reagan could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
