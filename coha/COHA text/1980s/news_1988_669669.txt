*Give up life in the fast lane of well-paying jobs , a perfect apartment on lower Fifth Avenue , and the comforts and culture of New York living to pursue a dream way off the beaten path. // *Bundle up their young children , a dog and two cats , and sail off to a new country without knowing the language - and with only $600 to tide them over. // *Teach their children at home by correspondence courses - plus hands-on archaeological digs , a 1 , 000-mile exploration of Spain on horseback , and an apprentice program with artists in residence. // *Spend 20 years falling in love with Spain , collecting , building , and preserving - and finally open a museum to share their dream. // // IT all began in 1962 , when a then 37-year-old Eugene ( Gino ) Hollander left a successful filmmaking career to become a painter . He felt he had to get away from the distracting mainstream to an inexpensive and sunny place. // Both he and his wife , Barbara , had talked of educating their three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous marriage , themselves . Europe beckoned , especially the sunny coast of Spain , where $100 a month let a family live comfortably. // Barbara , the more practical , wasn ' t sure that running away to the cliche-fantasy paradise in the sun was the answer . ' ' It was absolutely his idea , ' ' she says . ' ' He talked about trying it for six months while we lived on the sales of his paintings . But he only had one-way tickets , which I didn ' t know at the time. ' ' // The 38-year-old pioneer expatriates packed up the one- , three- , and five-year-olds ( with the nine- and 11-year-olds to join them later ) and set sail for Spain . When the boat docked in Gibraltar , it was raining nonstop , there was only goat ' s milk for the baby , and Barbara hated it immediately. // Then the sun came out , and they found a 20-room farmhouse above Torremolinos that included three maids , a gardener , and stables for $90 a month , and Gino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small band of English-speaking artists who knew one another only by their first names , and the local people were very friendly. // After six years in Torremolinos , the jet planes , high-rise condos , and James Michener ' s book ' ' The Drifters ' ' brought masses of tourists to the Costa del Sol. // The Hollanders scouted the Andalusian hills for a place to build their dream home away from the crowds . They found a barren 30 acres near Pizarra with an unobstructed view and only whitewashed farmhouses dotting the landscape. // They designed and built a 22-room farmhouse , a cortijo , from authentic bits and pieces of cast-off castles and mansions . Truckloads of ancient Moorish bricks , 42 giant doors ( dating from 1492 ) from a castle being demolished in Cordoba - plus finds from junkyards and markets - chugged to the building site every few days for months. // Antiques dealers had not yet discovered Spain . So the Hollanders furnished their home authentically and inexpensively . They improvised as they went , according to what had been found or salvaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home interior was authentic 16th century on completion. // Fireplaces warm the rooms during cool months . The living room has a castle door for a coffee table , and the dining room , its ceiling from a 12th-century chapel , could be expecting monks for the evening meal. // Ropes of onions and garlic give a homey touch to the kitchen , as does the long hallway of family photographs. // The Hollanders made it a family home , a place to come home to for children and grandchildren - something they saw less and less of in the America of retirement communities and nursing homes . They recently opened their house and a museum gallery to the public as an effort to share their love affair with Spain. // OVER the years , an instinctive teacher , Gino , and a reluctant one , Barbara , educated their children in unusual ways. // The Hollanders began to teach from a loose framework of correspondence courses from the Calvert School in Baltimore and then from the University of Nebraska High School . They brought in tutors who could pass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian. // These experts-in-residence had to be sports enthusiasts , who would fit lessons into jaunts to explore the countryside on horseback , weekends for skiing in the Sierra Nevada , or running with the bulls in Pamplona . It was a child ' s dream school. // The Hollanders also emphasized languages . Spanish was learned from some friends , and later the girls took sojourns in Switzerland for French , and in Germany , for immersion language training . Barbara and Gino instilled in the children a reverence for geography , history , and appreciation of the outdoors and the arts. // Barbara dismisses any idea that they set out to direct the children into art careers . Yet the very unconventionality of their education has led each of them into creative endeavors . ' ' I hate the word ' creativity . ' I just told them to be flexible and keep their options open. ' ' // What the Hollanders provided was a freedom to imagine , to expand and experiment without the necessity to conform . ' ' But you have to get out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' says Gino. // When it came time for college , each child was accepted at a United States college - Amherst , Barnard , and Columbia among them - without SAT scores. // Today , son Jim is a photographer with Reuters in the Gaza Strip . Daughter Siri is a bronze sculptor dividing her time between the US and Spain . Scott is a filmmaker in California . And daughter Lise is the museum representative in New York. // AS the children moved on into their own careers , Gino , now a respected and internationally known artist , and Barbara decided to build a gallery to show his paintings , rather than continue with dealers. // She wanted to show his work in a living setting . Slowly , with the addition of an antique table here , a Stone Age artifact there , they realized they had a museum in the making. // ' ' We backed into it like everything else in life , ' ' she says .

Visitors in small groups ( they allow only about eight at a time ) have poured in to be taken around by the Hollanders themselves. // On the walls are photos by their sons , bullfights , and cave paintings . Here and there are bronze sculptures by their daughter . And there are large canvases of Gino ' s in dreamy , impressionistic snatches of scenes and faces. // ' ' I chose painting for the oneness of the moment the medium can allow - the immediacy of expression , ' ' Gino has been quoted as saying . ' ' My paintings are expressly directed to evoke an emotional reaction from the viewer. ' ' // The Museo Hollander is so unexpected . It ' s a song of praise to Spain ' s rich heritage - and of how one family packed up their five kids and made their dreams come true. // //                  @ @ @
