A mass homecoming took place in southern Lebanon last week after the Israeli army released 752 prisoners , mostly Lebanese Shi'ite Muslims , from the Ansar detention camp twelve miles north of the Israeli border . As the men emerged from buses , some carrying the insignia of the International Red Cross , they were received with wild jubilation and festooned with flowers . Some had rifles immediately thrust into their hands . But the men were less than half the number who had been held at the camp . A day earlier , 1,200 other blindfolded and bound Ansar prisoners had been loaded onto buses with covered windows and taken south to another detention center in Israel . The transfer at once set off international protests over what many regarded as an illegal action . <P> The Ansar camp was built by the Israeli army in 1982 on a bleak , boulder- strewn plateau in southern Lebanon to hold Palestinians taken prisoner during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon . The detention center was emptied in 1983 after Israeli , Syrian and Palestinian groups arranged a prisoner exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months as the Shi'ites of southern Lebanon waged their own war against the occupying forces . Israeli authorities explained that although the freed prisoners were members of various terrorist organizations fighting the Israeli army , none was known to have actively participated in attacks on Israeli troops . Those removed from Lebanon to Israel last week , on the other hand , " took an active part in terrorist activities against Israel . " <P> The movement of prisoners across the border into Israel sparked heated protests over possible violations of the fourth Geneva Convention . Under the agreement , which Israel ratified in 1951 , individuals can be detained only within an occupied area and can not be taken to the territory of the occupying power , regardless of the reasons . Said the U.S. State Department : " We have consistently taken the position that the fourth Geneva Convention applies to areas of Lebanon under Israeli occupation . It appears that Israel 's actions are inconsistent with certain provisions of the Geneva Convention . " The International Red Cross and other organizations joined in the protests . <P> Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its actions in Lebanon because Israel had never declared the southern part of Lebanon to be occupied territory . The Israeli government also claimed that under the convention it had a right to move the prisoners as a security measure  --  in this case , to prevent the guerrillas from mounting more attacks on the withdrawing Israeli army . <P> The detention of the prisoners in Israel may well be related to secret negotiations to obtain the release of three Israeli prisoners being held by Palestinians in Syria . Western diplomats in Beirut put the matter bluntly . Said one : " In plain language , they are hostages . They wo n't be released for as long as the resistance keeps up its attacks .
