" Perhaps the real transition to democracy begins now " <P> The menace has crystallized in a single , indelible video-tape image replayed again and again on countless TV sets throughout Spain : Guardia Civil Lieut . Colonel Antonio Tejero Molina standing in the Cortes last Feb. 23 , holding the Spanish government , and the nation , at gunpoint . Tejero and his fellow military conspirators in the coup attempt were soon arrested , and Spain 's young democracy survived its gravest challenge . <P> But now many Spaniards are beginning to wonder just who won that fateful encounter . Far from being totally discredited after the coup , the country 's ultra-conservative armed forces-unchanged and unbending since Francisco Franco 's day-seem hardly affected . " Zero percent of the people here believe that the putsch failed , " says a moderate politician in Madrid . " Some think it is still going on , and many believe it actually succeeded . " <P> Unquestionably , the aborted coup attempt has transformed Spanish politics . Old issues-institutional reform , regional autonomy-have been swept aside for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted . The government has launched an investigation into the coup conspiracy , but almost no one in Madrid expects major purges to follow . However dubious its loyalties , the army is too powerful to be punished and shunted out of political life . Instead , Spain 's wary civilian leaders are seeking to pacify the generals , giving them , in effect , a silent veto in many areas of national policy . " We now have three chambers in the Cortes , " laments a prominent Socialist legislator , " the Congress , the Senate and the joint chiefs of the general staff . " <P> Nowhere is the army 's continued influence more evident than in the Basque country , where the separatist group ETA is waging a bloody terrorist war . During his 4 years in office , former Prime Minister Adolfo Surez resisted military pressure to allow the army into what he and many others viewed as a police problem . <P> All that changed , however , less than a month after the aborted coup when ETA gunmen killed two army colonels . Surez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army and navy limited , border-patrolling duty in the Basque region-a first step , critics charge , toward a new cycle of violence and repression whose main victim could be democratic government in Spain . <P> This month the bishops of the Basque cities of Bilbao , San Sebastin and Vitoria said as much in a pastoral letter that warned of the " coercive pressures " of the military on individual liberty . The three prelates condemned ETA 's continuing terrorism , but they also cautioned that the military 's new role in the Basque country could eventually pose a threat to democracy . " When the armed forces set themselves up as judge over the democratic process and feel tempted to intervene , " they wrote , " this constitutes a serious danger rather than a genuine defense of the interests of the people .
