OK , OK . There ' s nothing they can do but start in early April as long as the dollar requires the 162-game schedule . So there ' s no realistic way of starting everyone in a warm-weather city . The most important thing is to make certain that the schedules in each division are created equal . Thus , with the possible exception of the advantage St. Louis had over its NL East friends in opening in the Astrodome , most of the teams in three of the divisions are in the same boat . However , the crime of this week ' s frozen fiasco is the disadvantage the White Sox and Texas Rangers , neither of whom even play an AL West opponent until they meet one another May 17 , have unfairly suffered . While the Angels , Athletics , Mariners and Twins tick away without losing a beat of their pitching or hitting timing , and while the Royals got a game in and missed only two days ' full work , the White Sox and Rangers are nailed into a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing , but now each will be crippled later . The Rangers will be forced to play 14 games in 10 days on one trip . The White Sox are looking at six games in four days with Boston , followed by a trip to Cooperstown , followed by back-to-back twinighters in New York . In each case , that presumes that this weekend ' s remaining games in Cleveland and New York eventually get played . For whatever reasons , the fact is that the schedule is set up so that Texas and Chicago start the season with at least a three- to five-game disadvantage to Oakland and California . Which isn ' t right. - Minneapolis ' s Hubert Horatio Humphrey Metrodome may be replacing the Seattle Kingdome as the AL ' s leading launching pad - especially , so the theory goes , when the place is packed and the body heat raises the temperature of the entire building . " I ' ve got an ERA of 99 , " says reliever Babo Castillo , " but by the end of the season , that ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be the only ones with football scores . As a pitcher , you need a calculator and a sense of humor . " The Twins have permission to raise the seven-foot fence in right to 32 feet , but after Kent Hrbek , Gary Gaetti and friends hit some homers against the Mariners , Calvin Griffith surely was dissuaded from raising it . One small problem is that you can ' t see right field from the $4 seats . . . When Dave Collins signed with the Yankees , he was given George Steinbrenner ' s word he would play . " You ' ll play as much as Dave Winfield , " George told him . The hyper Collins , whom the Yanks are trying to make over into the $800,000 Herbie Washington , is not in today ' s lineup against the White Sox . . . The Yankees really do have a minor league first baseman named Millard Fillmore Williams . . . It wasn ' t enough that he suffered a shoulder dislocation horsing around , but Rollie Fingers then came up with the injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is interesting that while in the National League , Vida Blue was 16-1 against the Cubs and Padres , 38-39 against the rest of the league . . . The Athletics came right out and announced that they ' d paid Jeff Burroughs $125,000 . Billy Martin will use him as an occasional DH and , against certain lefties , sit down Dwayne Murphy , put Tony Armas in center and Burroughs in right . Poor Murphy has been plagued by injuries to his knee , ankle , back and calf this spring. - One has to appreciate the way the Angels and Athletics try to re- create the old Dodger-Giant feuds . First it was Rod Carew-Mike Norris . After Carew had two doubles and a single against Norris , he launched into a tirade because Norris had claimed that Rodney , 0 for 16 against him in 1980-81 , had ducked his screwball last season . " I ' ve faced a lot better pitchers and screwballs than his , " fumed Carew . Then there was Billy vs . Reggie . On opening night , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inning , Martin refused to have RHP Jeff Jones walk Jackson , even at 3-and-1 ; Jones struck him out . . . That ' s nothing compared to the Dickie Noles-Paul Householder feud . It seems that while playing for Indianapolis , Householder fouled off a bunt , prompting Noles , baseball ' s answer to Steve Durbano , to holler , " Hit like a man , " from the Oklahoma City dugout . Householder hit the next pitch out , and the next day , while Noles was doing his running in he outfield , they started a pregame brawl . The next night , Noles hit Householder in the head . Another brawl . Well , on Wednesday , first time up , Householder homered off Noles , who proceeded to bean the next batter , Clint Hurdle , touching off another brawl . " It ' s nothing personal ; I just don ' t like him , " said the philosopher Noles . . . Then there ' s the Cardinals ' Keith Hernandez , who charges the Astros with turning up the air conditioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enhance his knuckler . . . The John Henry Johnson gamble may be expensive - the Red Sox will be paying him his $200,000 salary until they decide whether to keep him - but it is a very good one . The guy ' s had head problems , fallen out of Don Zimmer ' s favor and didn ' t throw hard this spring , but he ' s 25 , hasn ' t had arm trouble , has a good working relationship with Lee Stange and has shown that he can come in from the bullpen and get lefties out ( 5-3 , 2.43 ERA , 46 hits , 21 walks , 52 strikeouts in 63 innings ) . If anything were to happen to Tom Burgmeier , the Sox would have no insurance . And if Johnson comes back , which they ' re convinced he will , they can go with two lefties and three righties in the bullpen . Johnson simply refused to go to Denver , and this is a no-lose situation : if he doesn ' t pan out , the Sox can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traveling secretary Jack Rogers estimates that the Sox ' side trip to Winter Haven cost approximatey $35,000- $50,000 extra . That doesn ' t include the $60,000 visitors ' gate share they lost by not having a road opener . . . Buddy Bell and Jim Sundberg were the only holdovers from last year ' s opening day lineup for Texas , and word is that if rookie CF George Wright can hit at all , Mickey Rivers will be gone - traded , sold , released - whenever he comes off the disabled list . It didn ' t help Mickey ' s case with the oilmen when he refused to play the last eight games because Eddie Chiles wouldn ' t give him a renegotiation loan. - The Red Sox ' first-round draft pick and the Celtics ' second- round pick - Bristol CF Steve Lyons and Danny Ainge - grew up next door to one another and played baseball and basketball together in the Santa Clara section of Eugene , Ore . Not only that , their fathers even worked together . Richard Lyons , as old-timers remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west . . . They don ' t show up in average salary figures , but the number of ill-advised long-term contracts that teams are eating has to catch up with them sometime . The Cubs , for example , ate $2 million worth of contracts ( Ken Reitz , Mike Tyson , et al ) , while the Angels released $1.5 million worth in one day in John D ' Acquisto , William Castro and Freddie Patek . . . Mets manager George Bamberger says he got as much mail in Milwaukee as he does in New York . " The difference , " says Bamberger , " is that in Milwaukee most of them were asking for autographs . Here , they read , This is the way your ( - - - - ) lineup should read . ' " . . . Mark Belanger on his biggest change going to the National League after 14 years in the American League : " Most players have to learn the pitchers . I have to learn the infields . " . . . It seems hard to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ' 76 Reds team is Pat Zachry ( who pitched 7 2/ 3 innings of no-hit ball against the Cubs yesterday ) , and the only three players left in Cincinnati are Johnny Bench , Dan Driessen and David Concepcion . . . Bench got $1 million , but not guaranteed . " I ' m from Oklahoma , " said Bench , " and in Oklahoma , that ' s the way we do things . " . . . Here is the AL All-Swinger team , based on career stats , the guys who ' d have the fewest walks in a season if they had 500 at-bats : C - Jamie Quirk , Kansas City ( 23 walks ) ; 1B - Dave Stapleton , Boston ( 21 ) ; 2B - Damaso Garcia , Toronto ( 13 ) ; 3B - Aurelio Rodriguez , Chicago ( 25 ) ; SS - Rob Picciolo , Oakland ( 8 ) ; OF - Harold Baines , Chicago ( 20 ) , Mickey Hatcher , Minnesota ( 22 ) and Willie Wilson , Kansas City ( 23 ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And to think Nordhagen has already been traded for Rodriguez and may soon be traded again to Minnesota for Hatcher . . . The Rodriguez deal got knocked in Chicago , but what the White Sox need on their bench is defense , and Chi Chi can still provide that . In fact , the White Sox helped themselves immensely in spring training by getting Rodriguez and Vance Law as backup infielders. - Well , it didn ' t take long . Some San Diego fans booed Garry Templeton in the Padres ' second game when he sidesaddled a ground ball and followed with a poor throw . . . Whoops . After hitting .154 in spring training , Davey Lopes has begun the season stumbling , causing speculation that he ' ll be platooned with Dave McKay at second base shortly . . . The winningest pitchers over the last five years : Steve Carlton ( 94 ) , Tommy John ( 89 ) , Dennis Leonard ( 88 ) , Ron Guidry ( 87 ) , Mike Flanagan ( 82 ) and Phil and Joe Niekro ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sox hired an English tutor for rookie Mexican RHP Salome Barojas , but now general manager Roland Hemond and assistant GM Dave Dombrowski are learning Spanish . . . One scary thing happened in Oakland this week when a foul tip smashed the bar on umpire Larry Barnett ' s face mask , sending him to the hospital . That kind of equipment should not be faulty , for obvious reasons . . . Earl Weaver and Ron Luciano were talking about their respective books . After mentioning that his first printing was 10,000 copies , Earl asked Luciano how big his was . " Mine was 50,000 , " replied the former ump , and Weaver said nothing more . " It may have been the first time I completely silenced him , " said Luciano . . . There are 83 rookies starting the season , including seven each with Atlanta ( which , like the Red Sox , has 18 playersfrom its own organization on its 25-man roster ) , Seattle and Minnesota .               @ @ @ @ @ @
