NEW YORK  --  The more one sees of American Ballet Theatre these days , the more one realizes that its greatest asset is Mikhail Baryshnikov  --  the performer , that is , not the artistic director . As a dancer , Mr. Baryshnikov remains a marvel . Now 38 years old , he has preserved enough of his youthful brilliance to keep him in the category of the phenomenal : On his best nights , he can still jump , turn and beat with breath-catching aplomb . More important , he invariably phrases with such clarity that the audience feels , as it does with few other male dancers , the full impact of the feats he is executing . Nowadays , the majority of the parts he tackles do not call for extraordinary virtuosity . But even to the least spectacular of his assignments he brings an uncanny sense of occasion . Neither the size of the role nor its nominal importance seems to make any difference to the conviction he projects  --  as witness the adagio from the second act of " Swan Lake , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the task of the male partner here is simply to enable the ballerina to extend the range of her movements . But there are also psychological implications in such a duet , and notwithstanding his gallant attentiveness and modesty of manner , it was always clear that , though he had nothing to dance , he was the Swan Queen ' s equal , not a mere supernumerary . The presence of Ms. Makarova in the final weeks of ABT ' s season at the Metropolitan Opera here was a double surprise . For one thing , her performances were announced only three days before they were due to begin . For another , no more than six months ago she declared that she had finished with classical ballet for good . As the excerpt from " Swan Lake " demonstrated , however , her decision was too hasty . Though at the age of 45 she is bound to be somewhat reduced in strength and scale , and thus in repertoire , Ms. Makarova still has more to offer than any other ballerina at ABT . Supple , harmonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dances as though it were the most natural thing in the world , as if , indeed , her still impressive classical technique were the expression , not of her will , but of her instinct . At the same time , the suddenness of her reappearance and the tenuousness of her relationship to ABT only emphasize how uncertain Mr. Baryshnikov has proved in the role of artistic director . So does the unexpected announcement that Rudolf Nureyev , now nearing 50 , will soon be appearing as a guest in the company ' s " Giselle . " No doubt , in order to fill a house as huge as the Met , ABT , which has no artistic identity to offer the general public , must have stars , or at least celebrities . Alessandra Ferri , who left Britain ' s Royal Ballet to join the company nearly a year ago , shows few signs of becoming an attraction of that kind , though not for any lack of publicity . When she first appears on stage in " Romeo and Juliet , " " Giselle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she makes an immediate impression , partly because of her unusual personality and partly because of her strikingly arched feet . Within a matter of minutes , though , one begins to realize that her expressive range is excessively narrow , and that , despite her youth , she lacks the stamina necessary to sustain the momentum she has initiated . Even her beautiful feet , it quickly turns out , are weaker than they look . That she fails to hold one ' s attention in Sir Kenneth MacMillan ' s " Requiem " is on the face of it , surprising . Not only does the technique called for by the ballet pose no threat to her limited capabilities , but also she seems to have been engaged by ABT primarily to act as muse to the British choreographer , who , we are told , takes inspiration from her gifts as a dancer . As it happens , Bonnie Moore , technically stronger , is more effective in the leading role . However , " effective " in these circumstances must be accounted a relative term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Makarova , who could make " Requiem " interesting . Set to Andrew Lloyd Webber ' s composition of the same name , " Requiem " is the first work Sir Kenneth has made especially for ABT since his recent appointment as artistic associate . " Requiem " hardly promises much for the future of the relationship . Not only does it add yet another insubstantial ballet to a dangerously impoverished repertory , it also poses a threat to the troupe ' s standards of classical dancing . Because Sir Kenneth ' s works characteristically require neither stylistic nor technical finesse , " Requiem " is likely to encourage the kind of slapdash approach to dancing that has now become the norm at the choreographer ' s home company , the Royal Ballet . No doubt Sir Kenneth has several works in mind for future ABT seasons , but , meanwhile , " Requiem " is more than enough to handle . For one thing , Mr. Lloyd Webber ' s music is hard to take , let alone take seriously . A slick blend of the sentimental and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead than as a trial for the living . A similar unavailing portentousness imbues Sir Kenneth ' s staging . Like so many European choreographers , he apparently believes that a weighty theme guarantees artistic validity . In a mystifying , half-garbled program note , he speaks of Cambodia and of evoking a world that " seems all-forgiving or all-avenging . " Unfortunately , the horror of war and the hope of redemption are not expressible by choreography that is all feeling and no art . In " Requiem , " the corps de ballet spends most of its time rolling around on the floor . Sometimes the dancers hide their eyes , sometimes they stop their ears , sometimes they utter silent screams . Every few minutes a young man staggers on stage holding the limp body of a young woman toward the audience in what looks like an appeal for sympathy . Not as ideologues or symbols , but as dancers caught up in this unholy mess , they certainly earn it.                 @ @ @ @
