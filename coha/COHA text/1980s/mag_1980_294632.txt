Amid pomp and protest , the limping Olympiad takes off <P> For three hours the capacity crowd of 103,000 at Moscow 's Lenin Stadium gazed in wonder at the gorgeous pageantry : a replica of a Greek chariot circling the track , dance troupes , precision ribbon twirlers , and a torchbearer who reached the top of the stadium by climbing a human staircase formed by some 500 soldiers holding wooden panels above their heads with the aid of sturdy braces . There was even a flash-card crew of 2,000 soldiers spelling out slogans like O SPORT , YOU ARE PEACE , HAPPINESS , JOY . <P> Despite all that pomp , no one at the opening ceremonies of the XXII Olympiad last Saturday could forget that it was something less than the real thing . About 30 countries that had planned to send athletes decided not to because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . Of the 81 countries participating , 16 staged symbolic protests during the opening-day parade by carrying Olympic banners rather than their national flags . <P> Saturday 's events mirrored the struggle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the glitter on their long-awaited spectacle , and the non-Communist nations , pretending they were somewhere else or concentrating on future Games . One impression quickly became clear : the Soviets own the television transmitters , and they are not bashful about decreeing what may and may not be beamed into the world 's living rooms about their Olympics . <P> Despite the U.S.-inspired boycott , the Olympics have generated plenty of news for the 5,500 foreign journalists on hand. * The International Olympic Committee met in Moscow 's House of Unions for four days before the opening ceremonies , and members spent much of the time debating the boycott . The meetings also produced a flap over the American flag . I.O.C. officials want to run it up the pole at the Games ' conclusion , as protocol dictates , to signify the U.S. as the site of the 1984 Olympiad . White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler last week sent the I.O.C. a letter objecting to that plan , but the committee plans to stand fast . Meanwhile , the local organizers of the 1984 Los Angeles Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the estimated tab of $347 million without U.S. Government aid . They could not have been too heartened , however , by a report from officials of this year 's Lake Placid Winter Games , who said that they still have a debt of almost $8 million . <P> During its sessions , the I.O.C. approved a clutch of new women 's events , including a bicycle race of either 50 or 70 km , the 400-meter intermediate hurdles and the 3,000-meter run . The last event leaves female distance runners less than 25 miles short of their goal : a marathon for women . One less orthodox addition is windsurfing , in which both sexes may compete . Naturally , there were some losers too : table tennis was rejected .
