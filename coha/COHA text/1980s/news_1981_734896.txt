txt MESA , Ariz . ? It may ho a trifle more streamlined than your usual spring training version of a Cub team : But the " new " Cubs ? Well , not yet . There 's still a little bit of stumble , bumble , and fall to their makeup . If you 're scoring , it 's exactly 33 weeks from Tuesday to the start of the 1981 World Series . But not too many Cubs were dreaming that impossible dream as they frolibked through their first spring workout . Least of all pitcher Dave Geisel , a nonrostered left hander who missed most of the 1980 Class AAA season because of injuries . " Dave was helping ( fellow pitcher ) Bill Caudill carry some stuff up to Bill 's second-floor apartment late Monday , " said Cub Manager Joey Amalfitano . Goad Samaritan ? Another one bites the dust . Dave fell down and broke his right collarbone . Exit Geisel . " We need lefties and two of them are gone before camp even opens , " said Amalfitano . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shoulder surgery in Los Angeles two weeks ago . " Dr. Frank Jobe did it and he gave me a 100 per cent guarantee that I will pitch again , " said Riley . " When ? Well , I can pick up a ball in about two months . " STILL , ALL WAS not bleak Tuesday at the grand opening of Camp Amalfitano . " At least most of the guys here are in good shape , " chortles trainer Tony Garofalo . " Just look at my weight chart . " The chart showed 6-7 rookie pitcher Lee Smith as the heaviest Cub , at 245 pounds . But what about pitcher Rick Reuschel and catcher Barry Foote , the Cubs ' famed " quarter-ton battery . " " Reuschel weighs 239 ; Foote a more 216 , " said Garofalo . " Honest ; I guarantee it . " " I WOULD N'T BET too much on the accuracy of that 239 for Rick , " said pitching coach Les Moss as he watched Reuschel trail a pack of jogging pitchers . " But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this team was as good an athlete as Reuschel is . " " Good weights , too , for Lynn and Dernis Lamp ? 215 each , " said Garofalo . " Big deal , " said . " We are n't going to win or lose anything in 1981 because of what we do or do n't weigh . " , the Cubs ' winningest pitcher last year ( 12 ) , propped himself on the trunk of a car . " We ca n't be as bad this year as we were last year , " he said . " AL least , I do n't think so . But then I made the same statement a year ago and I was wrong . " looked over the young arms on the field in front of him . " All right , I 'll ask it again , " he said . " Who are all the phenoms here this spring ? " DEFINE A PHENOM . " That , " said " is someone who is talented enough to hang a curve or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time one of the veterans on the staff does something like that , it costs him five runs . But the phenoms get away with it . Who are our phenoms ? " They have yet to register . " It figures , " said . " Say , who is that No. 7 over there ? Is that the new kid catcher ( Jody Davis ) ? " Yeah , that 's Davis , a contract holdout until late Monday . " A rookie holdout , eh ? " beamed . " He should fit right in . Same old Cubs . " But they are skinnier than usual .
