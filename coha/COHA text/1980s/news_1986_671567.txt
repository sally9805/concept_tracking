" What is it , " one onlooker said , " a traffic accident ? " // The sight of riot policemen and plainsclothesmen does not faze most people in Seoul . They see them every day , standing guard at the entrances to the city ' s ubiquitous underground passageways or taking tea breaks at their semipermanent posts outside university campuses. // The hand of authority is everywhere visible , but South Korea ' s is a curious kind of authoritarianism . This is a country where the Government can place opposition politicians under house arrest for starting a petition drive for a constitutional amendment , but where people do not cower in fear when a foreigner asks their opinion of the Government . It is a society where newspapers toe the Government political line and bitterly attack its economic policies . It is a place where political debate rages among some , while many others save their fervor for the work place. // Over the last few days , while the Government deployed thousands of policemen to seal opposition party headquarters , confine opposition politicians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public information officials have become concerned about their Government ' s image. // At a coffee break with a reporter the other evening , an information officer handed over a two-page note headed " Misleading terms used by the foreign press in reporting recent developments in Korea . " The note asked that reporters stop using the term " house arrest " to describe the confinement of opposition politicians to their homes by police troops. // Because no warrant for arrest had been issued , the Government said that the term house arrest was inaccurate . Instead , the Government suggested that reporters use the term " preventive restraint . " Next the note took foreign reporters to task for failing to point out that the opposition petition drive was really a cover for illegal activities intended to overthrow the existing constitutional order . " There is some concern , " the note read , " that the two terms ' house arrest ' and ' petition drive , ' taken out of context and read in an information vacuum , will lead to the conclusion that Koreans are being arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // With North Korea about a 45-minute drive from downtown Seoul , air raid drills and emergency precautions are second nature to the residents of this city . But for a few minutes the other day , when a Chinese pilot defected by flying his MIG 19 aircraft into South Korean air space , the emergency for which Seoul prepares so carefully seemed all too real. // At 2 : 26 P.M. on a Friday , air raid sirens sounded throughout the city . Radio and television programs were interrupted with a warning that an unidentified aircraft was approaching South Korea . Residents were told to extinguish all fires and seek cover immediately . Restaurants and theaters were asked to evacuate patrons . Hospitals led patients and their families into underground shelters , and nurses hurried to the bedsides of those too ill to move . At one industrial complex , officials seized sensitive documents and ran underground. // Traffic was snarled and telephone lines were jammed as people frantically called their homes or television stations for news . The alert ended after 14 minutes , and the city emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks for opposition politicians and their staffs . They huddled in coffee shops making plans for banned party meetings , compared notes about who was under " house arrest " and nodded at the plainclothesmen who dogged their movements . One cold Sunday morning , in a coffee shop near the home of opposition leader Kim Dae Jung , a reporter spotted several opposition party staff members with their heads together. // The reporter hurried over , asking them what would happen that day . Perhaps students were planning a demonstration , or politicians were holding a party meeting ? " No , no , you don ' t understand , " an aide to Mr. Kim replied . " Nothing will happen today . This is Sunday . It ' s a holiday. " // In private conversations , many Koreans feel free to state their opinions forcefully . But at any gathering , there are lines to be drawn . South Korean security laws define slandering the state as a very serious offense , a criminal act that carries with it a stiff jail term. // The law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners one recent evening . A group of friends were sitting at a discotheque capping off a long day with a few drinks . Unbidden , two women in very tight clothes came by and sat near the men in the group . After a few moments of desultory chatter , they proposed that the men leave with them for what they promised would be a memorable evening. // The men declined , but the women would not take no for an answer . Finally , one man leaned back , looked around and in a very loud voice made a very rude comment about South Korea ' s current President . The ladies of the evening scurried away to safer ground. // On several occasions in the last week , riot policemen staged spirited drills in a large parking lot in the middle of a busy downtown neighborhood . With shields and tear gas guns at the ready , the troops thundered up and down the lot in a series of maneuvers designed to foil demonstrators . They grappled with each other and threw their partners to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police playing themselves and another pretending to be student activists. // The riot policemen masquerading as students tied on headbands and marched around waving a Korean flag , in a tepid imitation of a student occupation of the United States Government building in Seoul last year . The policemen exploded clouds of mock tear gas. // The smoke drifted away from the parking lot , toward the streets lined with tiny shops selling twine , records , clothing , Buddhist artifacts , stereo equipment and photo albums . The storekeepers tended to their wares , oblivious or indifferent to the tumult around them. //
