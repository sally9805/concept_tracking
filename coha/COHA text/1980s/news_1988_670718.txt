I can ' t imagine any kind of return to any monolithic kind of Stalinism . I can ' t imagine that , because we know what it is . And secondly , our knowledge is becoming deeper because we understand better and better that Stalin alone is not the point . Far from it. // The point is the system he created , which was not able to protect society from Stalinism . The pure revisionism of Stalin led the country to such a state . That ' s why it ' s impossible. // And second , the perestroika of the economic and political system that is now taking place makes a turn backward impossible . <> <> Policy Flexibility // Will there be mistakes ? // Probably . Sometimes we do make mistakes . Many questions we don ' t know how to resolve . But I think our methods differ from those used in the past. // We don ' t portray ourselves as the most clever , infallible people .

If you read it carefully , you ' ll see we are not changing anything , we are simply confirming the original decision. // But the content is that in the original decision there were no prohibitions on dry wine , on beer , on cognacs . We didn ' t touch on that question . But in the process of carrying it out , the most ardent executors started to cut the sales of even those items in their annual plans , which resulted in elements of social tension. // Now we emphasize that the decision must be carried out , but carried out precisely , as it was planned , and not with overachievements . There are many other such cases . <> <> Baltic Nationalist Groups // You see , this is a social organization .

" Moreover , they put forward many ideas that are out of touch with reality. // How can they have their own currency in the context of a single state , a single financial network ? // California doesn ' t have its own currency . Even Eurocurrency was a failure . It doesn ' t have the authority that it once had . The petrodollar was also short-lived. // You know , we don ' t want to get into a debate about subjects that are obviously unrealistic . Yet their thoughts on this are useful. // For instance , they are demanding economic independence and economic accountability on a republic-wide scale .

In life everything can happen. // Not long ago I was in Latvia and Lithuania . I was greatly impressed by the mood of the intelligentsia , they left a positive impression on me . The majority of them are honest and reasonable people. // You have to talk things out .

There is a great deal of curiosity about the roles of the different members of the Politburo , for example , who chairs the Politburo when Mr. Gorbachev is away , and who chairs the Secretariat ? // A. Well , this is also in flux . It ' s being worked out . As for the Politburo , the Politburo decides in each instance. // Q. Is there a usual practice ? // A. The usual practice is that the Politburo decides in each specific case . This come up only during vacations . It ' s not a problem for us .

My impression is that Czechs themselves were seeking a more democratic society. // A. I ' m not talking about democratization , I ' m talking about interference .

The most important thing is to stand on your feet and not to fall to your knees. // Q. And Solidarity , is that the product of Western interference ? // A. Well , that ' s too direct a line of thought . But why finance it ? // Q. The West is financing Solidarity ? // A. No one is denying it . I ' m speaking only from this point of view .

When people realize that this is not always so , and sometimes really not so , this upsets them. // You write a lot that the stronghold of perestroika and glasnost is Ogonyok and Moscow News . They are good publications , good , and they indeed do a lot of good . They are progessive . But you know what sometimes happens. // Look , here is an article about a poll that was taken in Novosibirsk , which showed that perestroika is supported by only 16 or maybe 30 percent of the population , very little , I don ' t recall the exact figure. // The General Secretary said to me , listen , we have to go there . How can that be ? What are the party organs doing there that there is such a small percentage of support for perestroika ? // So , the reaction to the publication was very positive . The first reaction was that we have to take practical measures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was the truth , and that we have to take measures . There was never any question that Ogonyok might not have done it correctly. // I immediately dispatched an aide to the Novosibirsk region , to find out what was happening . And what did we find ? There had never been a poll . No one had ever answered any of these questions . It was all invented. // I said , no , that can ' t be . There must be some evidence for it . So we started digging , trying to find out where the smoke came from . It turns out , that a year earlier , a group of Novosibirsk scientists conducted a poll in the Omsk region , on entirely different topics , on how middle-level managers have reacted to perestroika. // The questions were different . One of the questions asked , how is the economic mechanism changing in connection with perestroika ? And actually 16 percent of the managers answered that the economic mechanism was changing very slowly , or was not changing at all . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have happened ? This is what we ' re talking about . This is why in more than one of my own speeches I have said that the democratization of the press and glasnost can exist only under one condition : if it is the truth . Factual .

I am talking about facts , and about laws . <> <> Gorbachev // There are certain periods in history when the course of events depends very much on a particular personality .
