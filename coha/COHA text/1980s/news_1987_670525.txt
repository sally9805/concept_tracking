In recent years public relations personnel were among the first to be slashed in company staff reductions . Now there are indications that top managers are putting a new emphasis on public relations , with additional stress on relationships with communities and government entities. // For example , in reducing its public relations staff recently , the Olin Corporation " uncoupled state from Federal Government relations and assigned its manager responsibility for public relations as well , " said Seymour Lusterman , a senior research expert for the Conference Board . Olin also established a public affairs department , he said . The board , a nonprofit business research organization , has just published a study called " The Organization and Staffing of Corporate Public Affairs. " // There are other indications of a new emphasis on more effective public relations . Larry Speakes , former White House press spokesman for President Reagan , now serves as vice president for communications for Merrill Lynch , at a time when the image of the financial community has been tarnished by insider trading charges and other scandals at some Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeline A. Weinstein , also a vice president , said recently that Mr. Speakes had asked that a segment on dealing with the press be included in training programs . The firm annually trains 1 , 750 new brokers , who are now called financial consultants instead of account executives , indicating their broader activities. // Merrill Lynch ' s current roster of 11 , 000 financial consultants around the country often have close contact with the public , the press , community organizations , and state and local governments , all of which require knowledgeable handling. // Egon Zehnder International Inc. , one of the largest management recruiting firms , recently issued a survey of corporate public affairs at leading companies . It found that many top corporate officials were worried about their relationship with the press , and therefore the public , and wanted to improve their image. // One result is that the executives have been easing their traditional " no comment " approach when asked questions . They tended to agree that they would need " to be better able to communicate with the press in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that companies have cut back on public relations staffs , " Mr. Lusterman said last week , adding that the Conference Board survey he wrote indicated that , to the contrary , a number of companies were increasing their public affairs activities and upgrading the importance of that department within the company . He acknowledged that some companies did not respond to the survey because of current or planned staff reductions. // The Conference Board study indicates that senior public affairs officers whose responsibilities include government relations tend to be well educated - 50 percent have bachelor ' s degrees , 24 percent master ' s degrees and 20 percent law degrees. // They tend to be middle-aged , with 17 percent 45 to 49 years of age and 59 percent older. // More than half of the top public affairs managers report directly to the chief executive , one indication of the importance given to such jobs. // Perhaps one problem for those working in public affairs is that the field spans a wide variety of specialties within a company - investor relations , employee communications ( handbooks , newsletters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Federal and local governments , media relations , and " issues management. " // The last category might include specialists on minority problems and investment in South Africa , for example . In some companies there is a new part of the public affairs function - international public relations. // Because there are so many sectors , public affairs personnel at lower management levels face the danger of becoming overly specialized and thus not suitable for promotion to the top spots. // For public relations personnel with a broad knowledge , there might be good jobs in certain industries , according to Mr. Lusterman ' s study . He found that those companies increasing staffs included financial institutions , wholesale and retail trade concerns , and utilities . Those making the largest cuts in public affairs staffs , he said , were transportation companies and durable goods concerns. //
