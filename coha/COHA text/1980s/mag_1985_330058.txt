The setting is a town off the dirt road from Southwest Nowhere , but the emotional topography bears the mark of James M. Cain . A scorching sun boils the conversation into lies and insults ; on the hot , empty nights there is little for a woman to do but cheat on her husband , and little for the husband to do but plot his mortal revenge . It sounds all too familiar : the slapping of thigh on thigh , the contagious guilt of working-class adulterers , the geometry of ricocheting recriminations , fate twisting duplicitous lovers slowly in the wind  --  The Postman with Body Heat Rings Double Indemnity . <P> Not this time . Blood Simple ( the title comes from Dashiell Hammett ) works terse , elegant variations on a theme as old as the Fall ; it subverts the film noir genre in order to revitalize it ; it offers the satisfactions and surprises of a conniving visual style . Most important , it displays the whirligig wit of two young men  --  Joel Coen , 30 , a graduate of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27  --  in a debut film as scarifyingly assured as any since Orson Welles was just this wide . <P> The put-upon husband in this galvanizing redneck gothic is Julian Marty ( Dan Hedaya ) ; he owns a roadside bar and moves and thinks with a gorilla 's heavy resolve . His wife is Abby ( Frances McDormand ) , whose sexual desperation has drawn her into a liaison with Ray ( John Getz ) , a bartender at Marty 's place . They may not have much more in common than boredom , but it beats sleeping alone , or with Marty . The cuckold is aware of this , so he hires a mean , giggly detective ( M. Emmet Walsh ) to kill them . The detective has a better idea . He 'll kill his client instead , pocket the ten grand and frame the intended victims as the murderers . Just two problems : Ray , not the police , finds Marty 's corpse ; and Marty is not quite dead . So Ray , thinking that Abby did the deed to be with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is film noir stripped down to its basics  --  a road , a bar , a motel , an affair , a private eye , a murder , a pinwheeling series of betrayals  --  then customized with camera style . Strapped to a car fender , or sauntering at ankle level through a rowdy party , or tracking smoothly down a long bar counter ( and over a passed-out customer ) , the Coens ' camera is a participant in the action , and worlds hipper than anyone on-screen . " Hi , I 'm here , " it as much as says , " and I 'm soooo smart . " It is too ; it creates elegant riddles of space and time , then solves them with an originality that hits the viewer like a rabbit- punch line . The lovers repose in bed , a turnstile fan lazing above them , Venetian blinds notching shadows on their backs , and outside their window looms the detective . For a moment the low growl of Marty 's backyard incinerator can be heard , and then the screen whitens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cremated . It is the flash of the detective 's camera . <P> Blood Simple has plenty of flash  --  the sort of cinema virtuosity that can be overpraised precisely because it is so difficult to describe . Just as easily , the movie can be underrated as a film-school exercise , with visual strategies reminiscent of both Terrence Malick and Sergio Leone , and a grisly climax that borrows from Psycho and Ministry of Fear . But Blood Simple infiltrates the central nervous system even as it opens the cultist 's sharp eye . Watch this film , and these film makers , closely . Neither will disappoint .
