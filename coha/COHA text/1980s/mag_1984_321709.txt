No longer a minority , the Sephardim gain political clout <P> It is a sad but all too classic pattern . At one end of society are the rich , whose money buys them opportunities and whose opportunities bring them more money . At the other are the poor , caught in a downward spiral in which nothing , it seems , can come of nothing . College graduate and illiterate can not find a common language , high liver and low achiever can not see eye to eye . The northerners scoff at the warm passions and expansiveness of their compatriots to the south , the southerners scorn the icy rationalism and inhibitions of their countrymen to the north . <P> In Israel , all those contrasts and conflicts were for decades embodied by the Sephardim*- ( who flocked to Israel from southern European countries , North Africa and the Middle East ) and the Ashkenazim ( who came from Central and Eastern Europe ) .

The Ashkenazim have lampooned what they see as the less disciplined and sophisticated Sephardim , and the Sephardim , in turn , have scorned the standoffish Ashkenazim . In a few particularly ugly instances , the Sephardim have been dubbed " Khomeinis " ; they have responded by calling their antagonists " Aske-nazis . " Even Prime Ministers , including European-born David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir , have spoken darkly of the dangers of " mob rule " and sweepingly written off " the primitive Arab mentality " of the Sephardim . <P> The word Arab is in effect the heart of the matter : the majority of the Sephardim have their roots in the Islamic world . Though they know their Arab neighbors better , and like them less , than do their compatriots of European origin , they are often lumped by association with Israel 's sworn enemy .

But the Middle Eastern Jews who arrived in Israel 36 years ago found that Jews from Poland , Germany and the Soviet Union had created a land in the image of their old European homes . Speaking the Judeo-Spanish language of Ladino , the Sephardim could not follow the cadences of its Central European equivalent , Yiddish . Accustomed to Middle Eastern pastimes , they were little taken with cafes based on the coffeehouses of Vienna and Budapest and filled with Hapsburg-era music . Raised on couscous , they had no taste for gefilte fish . Even their religious customs differed from those of the Europeans : at Passover , for example , the Sephardim are allowed to eat rice and legumes , which are forbidden the Ashkenazim . They also sometimes indulge in exuberant rites , energetically re-enacting the Exodus and slapping each other with onions as a reminder of the Egyptians ' lashing of the Jews .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
