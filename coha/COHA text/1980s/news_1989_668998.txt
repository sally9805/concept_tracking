First off , you should know that this person is relatively stable . I have been an acquaintance of hers for many years , and her credentials are impeccable . She is one of the brightest people I know ; she is 35 , she is married , she graduated from a prestigious university in the East , she has not one master ' s degree but two , and she is currently studying for a Ph . D. in clinical psychology . You should know those things because of what you are about to hear . " The first time I saw the message I was completely devastated , " she said . " I read it and I was bowled over . " The message she refers to was on the inside of a candy wrapper . This woman enjoys the taste of chocolate . She purchases candy from vending machines . A few years ago she noticed that certain candy products manufactured by M &; were featuring an " instant winner " promotion . The idea was that you opened your candy bar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside of the wrapper . You could win a prize-money or merchandise . If you lost , you found out right away , too . And this is what depressed her so . Obviously , in a contest like that there are far more losers than winners . And every time she would open a candy wrapper , the message would be : " You Are Not a Winner . " " I felt they were talking about me personally , " she said . " Of course , I knew that they couldn ' t have had me in mind when they printed that wrapper . But think of it : You Are Not a Winner . ' It ' s such a personal thing to say . It ' s like this candy company has made this horrible , horrible judgment about me . " Was there a chance that she was overreacting ? " I don ' t think so , " she said . " A lot of times , when you buy a candy bar you are feeling a little low . You need some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a winner . If you ' re not a winner , what are you ? You ' re a loser . " To repeat : This is a smart woman who is well on her way to being a psychologist , and who had achieved great success in a different field before deciding to study psychology . Yet the " You Are Not a Winner " messages truly bothered her ? " It was crushing each time , " she said . " I don ' t think you have to have especially low self-esteem to be hurt by something like that . On one level , I felt that the candy company was making a personal assessment of me . It wasn ' t so much like the company was socking me in the stomach every time . It was more like a pinch . A hard pinch , with the intention of causing me pain . " This might be merely mildly interesting-if that-except for one thing : Apparently the woman ' s hurt feelings were a rather widespread phenomenon . Because the other day she opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the message inside the wrapper did not say : " You Are Not a Winner . " The message said : " Sorry . This Wrapper Is Not a Winner . Please Try Again . " " Don ' t you see ? " she said . " They changed ! It ' s no longer me who isn ' t a winner . It ' s the wrapper ! The wrapper isn ' t a winner ! That feels so much better . " Her theory was that the M &; people had been bombarded with complaints from other sensitive Americans-Americans who did not like being told that they , personally , were not winners . It sounded unlikely-a whole bunch of people who became despondent when a candy wrapper told them that they were not winners ? - but I promised this woman I would check it out . M &; with headquarters in Hackettstown , N.J. , is famous for its corporate closedmouthedness-the Wall Street Journal has referred to the company ' s secretiveness as " legendary " - but I managed to persuade the company to read me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrappers . The statement said , " There was no intention to offend anyone , but due to constructive consumer comments " it had been decided to change " You Are Not a Winner " to " This Wrapper Is Not a Winner . " Mary Ellen Dougherty , an official at M &; said that the instant winner games change from product to product and month to month . The company manufactures M &; Mars Bars , Milky Ways , Three Musketeers and Snickers , among other candy . Right now , Dougherty said , it is the Snickers bars that are carrying the " This Wrapper Is Not a Winner " messages . " Some of our customers apparently took the other message personally , " Dougherty said . " We were happy to change it . " And my friend ' s reaction ? " I feel vindicated , " she said . " This proves to me that there are other people out there who have the same sensitivities that I do . " Well. . . apparently so . " Now I can open the wrapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the contest , my feelings aren ' t going to be hurt , " she said . Yes , she will be saved from that anguish . " Does this whole thing sound crazy to you ? " she said . Hey. . . you ' re the budding psychologist . I just write this stuff down.
