They own Los Angeles ' Arco Plaza . In New York City they have scooped up the Exxon Building , the Algonquin Hotel and the vaultlike home of Tiffany &; Co . They are beating the U.S. at everything from VCRs to semiconductors . And now they are trying to buy U.S. colleges . <P> In recent months Japanese businessmen and educators have quietly offered to bail out several financially strapped schools in return for control of their governing boards . The purpose : to expand study-abroad opportunities for Japanese university students . " The American higher-education system is the best in the world , " says Julia Ericksen , vice provost of Philadelphia 's Temple University . " The Japanese recognize that . " <P> So far , there have been no outright takers , but a few colleges have negotiated deals that stop short of selling their independence . This spring Warner Pacific College , a small ( enrollment : 400 ) church-affiliated school in Portland , Ore. , is expected to approve the sale of 49% of its physical plant to Amvic International , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6 million price tag includes an agreement to lease the facilities to the college for 30 years and to make the firm 's president a regent of the school . The transaction benefits both parties : Amvic 's direct link with the U.S. college gives it a valuable marketing tool back home , and Warner Pacific is relieved of its crippling debt . <P> Another church-affiliated institution , Phillips University in Enid , Okla. ( enrollment : 960 ) , was approached last spring by Kyoto Institute of Technology , which offered $24 million for the entire school . Phillips ' president , Robert Peck , refused . " Colleges are not bought and sold , " he says . " We 're not Quaker Oats . " But he was under intense pressure to accept the offer from Enid 's town fathers , who in March 1988 paid $14.3 million to keep the campus afloat , and now charge the university rent . As a compromise , Peck let Kyoto underwrite a summer program for up to 50 Japanese students . <P> While the Japanese continue to seek academic footholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing American-style education to Japan . In 1982 Temple University became the first U.S. school to establish a branch campus in Japan . In a new nine-story Tokyo building financed by a separate Japanese board , some 1,600 Japanese students attend classes taught in English by Temple professors . Last fall Dartmouth 's Amos Tuck School of Business followed suit with Japan 's first-ever English-language M.B.A . program . More than 40 other institutions , including Texas A &; M and M.I.T. , are negotiating similar deals . " The Japanese lack preparedness for globalization , " says Chikara Higashi , president of Temple University Japan . " These institutions are an ideal means for them to overcome the language barrier and other obstacles . " <P> Allowing Japan to buy into U.S. schools worries some American educators , who fear this would be the ultimate technology transfer . But the deals also provide vital links to Japanese business , a chance for American students and faculty to be exposed to that country 's culture , and , not incidentally , a source of revenue for U.S. institutions . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assistant to the president at Warner Pacific . " There is no question that higher education will be more international in the future . "
