 | Of all the fretful stages of human development , adolescence is the most infamous . It is an age nobody loves . The mere mention of the subject among parents is enough to set them exchanging commiserative anecdotes about perverse and ungovernable teenagers . For adolescents themselves , it is the age of anomie ? a time of struggling to balance the capacities and desires of adults with the social franchise of children . Traditionally , that struggle , stormy though it might be , was waged largely within the confines of the family . But in recent years the embattled family has seemed no longer able to contain it . Some experts fear that the domestic upheavals of recent years have shaken the ability of parents and children alike to deal with what were once regarded as ordinary growing pains . Adolescents are now spilling out their concerns in therapists ' and counselors ' offices ? and , in unprecedented numbers , in hospital psychiatric-care units . It is as if the decibels had been turned up on all the classic complaints of growing up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenagers he sees " feel helpless , not in control of their lives . Their support structures are falling away . " According to one recent study , about a third of adolescents navigate the awkward teen years without a hitch , a third run into occasional turbulence and a third get into major difficulties . It maybe that the nature of those difficulties is changing : national data shows a decline in alcoholism , drug abuse and serious crime since 1980 . Teenage suicide has also plateaued in the past five years . But mental-health practitioners around the country are convinced that , overall , teens ' problems are worsening . Dr. Michael Roy , director of the adolescent unit at the McCauley Neuropsychiatric Institute at St. Mary 's Hospital and also a juvenile justice commissioner in San Francisco , insists there is not only a dramatic increase in psychological-support requirements for the young but in the severity of pathology . " No other age group compares with the increase , " he says .

" Hidden system : According to data compiled by the House Select Committee on Children , Youth and Families , admissions to inpatient psychiatric services of children under 18 more than doubled between 1970 and 1980 . Between 1980 and 1984 , adolescent admissions to private psychiatric hospitals increased more than 350 percent , from 10,765 to 48,375 . Yet in many cases young people are being hospitalized not only for drug abuse or suicide attempts ? problems that may , indeed , call for intensive treatment ? but for vague afflictions such as " conduct disorder " and " adolescent adjustment disorder " ? meaning that they maybe runaways , or truants , or guilt y of " promiscuity . " According to committee testimony , most children were coerced into entering hospitals , where they were confined in locked-door units ; in about 40 percent of the cases hospitalization was found later to be " unnecessary . " A study by sociologists Carol Warren and William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a hidden system of adolescent social control . " In other words , parents sometimes seek it " as a relief " from uncontrollable adolescents . Mental-health professionals nevertheless resist the intimation that parents are simply " dumping " their problem children . Some doctors view the surge in teen therapy as , in a way , salutary , an indication that parents have grown more sophisticated about seeking psychological help for their children , much as they would go to a pediatrician for their physical problems . They note that the parents usually have tried various other measures before resorting to psychiatry or hospitalization . " Seventy-five percent of the parents are excellent at their job , and they 've demonstrated that by raising other kids suc : ; essfully , " says Dr. Allan McDonald , head of the adolescent-care unit at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena , Calif . Jeff , * 16 , was recently released from the Las Encinas adolescent-care unit . Six weeks ago his parents brought him there after telling him they were going somewhere else . " They were tearful , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls . " But they had tried everything and were at their wits ' end . " When Jeff arrived , says McDonald , he " acted out , slamming doors and threatening to kill me . For three days he refused to talk to me and called me a lot of names . " Jeff finally apologized for his behavior but , according to McDonald , he remained resentful for weeks about being there and had trouble participating in group therapy . The majority of patients at the 19-bed Las Encinas unit are under treatment for general depression , but Jeff was one of the two or three cases of behavior disorder that are usually on board . Twice in one week Jeff had smashed up the family car . Family members had also begun to notice that they were missing small amounts of money . He had been skipping school and had become withdrawn and belligerent . One day the family 's computer vanished , and when Jeff was accused he admitted taking it to get money but refused to say for what . It was the school that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health experts believe a number of factors have combined to push parents into I  | considering hospitalization an option for problem children ? and not least is the increasing availability of insurance to pay for treatment . To date , 13 states have laws mandating inclusion of psychiatric coverage in insurance plans , with many more expected to join the list . As hospital stays become shorter , because of improved medical care and changes in medical coverage , psychiatric patients are helping to take up the slack . Many insurance plans , in fact , cover psychiatric hospitalization but not outpatient treatment . Thus , to some extent the reimbursement system may be determining the kind of treatment that children receive . " There is a major concern about inappropriate hospitalization , " says Dr. Ira S. Lourie , director of the Child and Adolescent Service System of the National Institute of Mental Health . " There are a lot of options available ? but often kids end up in hospitals because that is what insurance will pay for . " Dramatic shift : But insurance coverage is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states began decriminalizing " status offenses " such as drinking and truancy , in which no actual crime has been committed . Instead of placing wayward youngsters in juvenile-detention centers and reform schools , courts began referring them to psychiatric facilities . The shift has been dramatic . According to a fact sheet of the House select committee , just under 200,000 nondelinquent youths were held in juvenile-justice facilities in 1979 ; by 1981 the number had dropped to a little under 23,000 . Perhaps partly as a result , psychiatric units for the young have become a growth item for the hospital industry . " The rewards associated with the successful development of these programs can be significant , " says an industry newsletter . Indeed , a growing number of corporations have been eying adolescent psychiatric care as a potential moneymaker . Private ownership of such facilities increased 150 percent between 1969 and 1982 , and 85 percent of the facilities were under chain ownership . In and around Salt Lake City , five for-profit health-care institutions have announced plans to build psychiatric hospitals , establishing more than 725 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities , a $10 million , 90-bed hospital , will be managed by the University of Utah School of Medicine 's psychiatry depart- ment but will be built by National Medical Enterprises , a firm that operates 47 private psychiatric units nationally . Norman Zober , president of NME 's Psychiatric Group in Washington , says that 35 percent or more of the beds his company is currently making ready will be given over to adolescent care , as against 15 percent only a few years ago . No one doubts that the need for psychiatric care is often geniune . Elsewhere , most units operate at capacity , with long waiting lists . The McAuley Neuropsychiatric Institute at St. Mary 's Hospital in San Francisco , which handles severely disturbed juveniles , is so swamped with court-ordered referrals that it has had to contract with other northern California hospitals to accept the overload . But the sudden spurt in for-profit facilities has stirred fears that the sheer availability of beds will promote hospitalization . Even so , as USC sociologists Warren and Staples concede in their otherwise critical study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control , " hospitals may be the most humane alternative for many children , particularly those with chaotic family situations . Most units provide a protected environment with a fair amount of regimentation and concentrated doses of therapy . Patients stay for anywhere from a month to a year and a half ( insurance usually pays for up to 30 days , but doctors often get extensions ) , working their way up a system of credits that can earn them privileges , such as a weekend pass to visit their families . Parents are usually drawn into the therapy process as well . " We look at every behavior problem as a chance for therapy , " says Michael Geffen , director of psychological services at Horizon Hospital in Pomona , Calif . " By confronting the kids and holding them accountable for their behavior , we try to get L F E S T Y L  | them to see how that behavior has gotten them into trouble in the past , how it has affected the family and how it has done nothing but hurt them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tend to change their attitude when they feel that they 're being helped . Sixteen-year-old Amy was signed into Horizon after i she had an abortion and , weeks later , attempted suicide with sleeping pills and aspirin , following a bitter quarrel with her parents . " The worst part about being in the hospital was just that I was in there , " she recalls . " I know I got help , but I did n't want to be there . " The best part , Amy says , was the support the patients gave each other . " It was like a family relationship ; they knew part of what I was going through because they had been through it . " Back at home , Amy feels she is communicating better with her parents now . Her mother cautiously agrees . " It was so hard taking her there and then wondering when she was going to be able to come out , " she says . " But I think now it was the best thing for her ... In the back of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's something real gutsy to confront . " Explosive episodes : Ironically , even when hospitalization seems the only alternative , the system may resist . The parents of Steve Silverman , 17 , found themselves pitted against their son 's court-assigned lawyer when they filed a PINS ( Persons in Need of Supervision ) petition in Manhattan 's Family Court . Steve , a cocaine user , had embarked on a series of explosive episodes from about the age of 12 , when his adored grandfather died and his father was hospitalized with a back problem . A psychologist diagnosed " attention deficit disorder , " a form of learning disability , but neither the schools nor a string of psychiatrists provided much help . When all else failed , Mrs. Silverman filed a PINS , but her son 's advocate said her testimony about his behavior was hearsay . " I was completely impotent , " she says . " They were all for keeping the child at home . It was the most frustrating and traumatic experience . " The court did put Steve on a waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never called back . When she refused to take Steve home from a police station after another destructive outburst , he was sent to a public hospital where he was locked up with psychotic adults . Finally she managed to get him @# transferred to the adolescent unit at Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit , N.J. , a private psychiatric institution renowned for its drug-treatment facilities . Like many such units , the one at Fair Oaks operates behind locked doors and has a so-called " quiet room " ? a windowless solitary-confinement cubicle ( where Steve was sent once after he " went berserk , " according to his mother ) . But it also has many amenities , including pleasant grounds , a 3-to-1 staff ratio and an accredited high school . Steve entered Fair Oaks last February . He earned A 's and B 's at the school , his first good grades ever , and eventually became a group leader . Discharged in November , he is seeing a psychiatrist once a week , studying for a high-school-equivalency certificate and working , although not very happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting , he 's struggling to re-enter society , " says his mother . " There were times when I felt like giving up , but wanted to be able to say that I 've tried everything and that I cal : go to my grave in peace . " Despite the proliferation of adolescent-care units , they are available to only a limited number of children who might need them . The Silvermans ' medical insurance covered the $6,000-aweek bill for Steve . But many families do not have extensive insurance coverage ? or any insurance at all . Those who seek help from the social-services system often run into bureaucratic snarls in which they are bounced from agency to agency . Juvenile-justice experts complain that luck and state resources determine which delinquents go to detention centers and which are assigned to psychiatric facilities . On the whole , according to testimony before the House select committee , only a third of the 3 million young people who need psychiatric services are getting them . Terrified parents : Yet a question remains whether some segments of the adolescent population are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture is more attuned to psychiatry and many parents have undergone therapy themselves , they can be quick to seek help for their children at the first emotional danger signals . Also , media coverage has heightened parents ' awareness of teenage suicide , so they may worry more about signs of severe depression . " There have been some real frightening things that have happened in the last five years , " says Catherine Blusiewicz , an Atlanta psychologist who specializes in family and adolescent counseling . " Parents have to cope with things that the previous generations did n't have to , and they 're terrified . " In their eagerness to cope , parents and professionals may be going somewhat overboard . For the families of acutely disturbed children like Amy , Jeff and Steve , intensive psychiatric care offers haven and hope . But an age that has managed to identify a syndrome called " adolescent adjustment disorder " may be slipping toward emotional hypochondria . The wide-scale disruption of the family wrought by divorce , separation and remarriage in the past decade is said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it has begun , to seem that the role of caretaker might fall to the psychiatrists.
