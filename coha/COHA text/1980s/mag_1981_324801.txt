Exile church canonizes the last Tsar and 30,000 other martyrs <P> Tsar Nicholas II , the last emperor of Russia , would seem to some an unlikely candidate for sainthood . He consulted faith healers , intervened highhandedly in church affairs and ruled with a sublime ineffectiveness that helped pave the way for the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution . But last week in New York City , Tsar Nicholas , his wife Alexandra , their son and four daughters , all murdered in 1918 by the Bolsheviks , became saints . In an unprecedented ceremony of glorification , they , along with some 30,000 other Russian Orthodox Christians killed by the Soviets , were named " martyrs " and canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia , a strongly anti-Communist offshoot that claims 270,000 adherents , including 150,000 in the U.S. <P> Orthodox theology stresses martyrdom as a sign of holiness in a potential saint . Determination of sainthood is a much less formal matter than in the Roman Catholic Church , where a lengthy , legalistic procedure emphasizes an exemplary moral life and the performance of miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died for the faith , and the Orthodox communion of saints includes hundreds of thousands of such martyrs . <P> The Tsar , who ruled Russia for 23 years , also served as temporal leader of the Russian Orthodox Church . His killing thus has a special significance for a church that refuses to acknowledge the present Patriarch of Moscow because of his subservience to an atheistic regime responsible for the deaths of as many as 12 million Christians . The murder of the imperial family was " not merely an act of political reprisal , " wrote Metropolitan Philaret , the church 's New York City-based leader , in a special epistle on the canonization , " but an act principally of the spiritual annihilation of Russian Orthodoxy . " <P> The mass canonization came about after the church obtained from inside the Soviet Union a document verifying the circumstances of thousands of martyrs ' deaths . Most died in slave-labor camps . For the final ceremony , 1,000 clergy and laity turned up , including Prince Vladimir , the Pretender to the Russian throne , and many converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota , and two Japanese seminarians . <P> They all jammed into Park Avenue 's handsome , red-brick Cathedral of Our Lady of the Sign , which was decorated with hundreds of white , red and blue carnations , the colors of the tsarist flag . <P> Most stood patiently for five hours as two choirs intoned a hymn to the new saint ( We glorify you , O Martyred Tsar ) , and gazed at a new icon commissioned for the canonization . It features Nicholas , Alexandra , and their offspring Alexis , Olga , Tatiana , Maria , and the elusive Anastasia , who some observers feel survived the family slaughter . For the first time , the faithful prayed not for Nicholas ' soul , but for his intercession in their behalf , as a friend of God . For the new St. Nicholas , toppled from one of the earthly realm 's most powerful thrones , it was quite a comeback .
