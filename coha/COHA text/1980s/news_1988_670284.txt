NEW YORK  --  For people seeking high yields on bank money market accounts , the best investment may be a 25-cent stamp . Depositors who bank by mail these days can get yields that are unusually high . Often the banks don ' t offer these yields even to their own branch customers . The sale-by-mail approach is one of a number of marketing tactics that the nation ' s banks and thrifts have unfurled recently . Their goal : to keep costs down while fighting this year ' s outflow of cash from bank accounts into a competing vehicle , money market mutual funds . To bank by mail , " You have to be willing to live without seeing a building with a name on it , " says Douglas Shimrak , president of Empire Direct , the mail division of Empire of America , Buffalo , N.Y. And checks drawn on faraway banks aren ' t always welcome , though most people don ' t use money market accounts for routine bills . Empire currently offers direct-mail customers a 7. 72% rate on money market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual yield of 8. 02% . That compares with a 7% rate and 7. 25% yield for depositors at branches in western New York state , where the bank is based  --  or an extra $77 on your $10 , 000 deposit . Other banks are doing even better on mail deposits . First Deposit National Bank in Tilton , N.H. , is paying 8. 19% on a minimum of $5 , 000  --  a yield of 8. 53%  --  until Dec. 2 . Then the rate falls to 7. 25% . But even the lower rate is higher than what the bank ' s branch customers get : currently 5. 5% to 7% depending on the size of their deposits . The highest-yielding money market account in the nation currently is offered by New York ' s Irving Trust : 9. 10% , or a 9. 52% yield , on deposits of $15 , 000 or more . That lofty level amounts to nearly three percentage points more than the 6. 25% offered at Irving branches . " The response has been phenomenal " since the account was introduced Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers phones at Irving ' s toll-free number . The high rate , intended to draw more deposits into the bank , ends Nov. 30 . But even then , Irving ' s bank-by-mail customers will get substantially more than branch clients . Its usual rate on mail deposits above $15 , 000 is half a percentage point above the seven-day yield  --  currently 7. 48%  --  on money market mutual funds , as listed in Donoghue ' s Money Fund Report . A few mail accounts now yield even more than the top money market mutual fund , which posted a compounded 8. 52% yield for one recent week . But mail banking isn ' t for everyone . Top rates tend to be available only on large deposits , and only for a limited time . " For the average investor , the cost of mail and time will probably offset the advantage of a small differential in yield , " says Norberto Mehl , publisher of Banxquote Online , a bank-rate information service . But banks are happy , he says : They " can raise the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower cost . " Empire ' s mail operation has a full-time staff of only four people , and costs less than half as much as a branch to run . Yet it vastly expands the bank ' s depositor base . " We can ' t open a branch in Omaha , " Mr. Shimrak says , " but we can have Omaha customers banking with us . " Banks are struggling to reverse this year ' s pattern of losing ground in the battle for money market investors . Through June , the assets of bank and thrift money market accounts fell 4% from the level of October ' s market crash . Meanwhile , assets of money market mutual funds climbed 7% . Attracting new money is crucial for banks now because October is the second most popular month for certificate of deposit rollovers , after April . Rollovers this year will be particularly heavy because many people switched to CDs after the stock market crash . Cash is flowing into certificates of deposit , but that trend isn ' t entirely pleasing to bankers . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still keep the cost of funds lower than on six-month and one-year CDs , " says Richard Funsch , senior vice president of Florida Federal Savings in St. Petersburg . The thrift ' s yield is 7. 31% on money market accounts of at least $75 , 000  --  a full percentage point below what a one-year CD would pay , he says . ( This thrift ' s accounts are available only in Florida . ) Nationwide , the average yield on bank money market accounts runs 6% to 6. 5% depending on the deposit ' s size , while six-month CDs yield more than 7% on average , according to Banxquote . Banks adjust interest rates on money market accounts periodically . Money market accounts usually pay lower rates than the fixed-rate CDs in part because they are more flexible , generally allowing depositors to write as many as three checks a month . Another marketing gimmick : To persuade depositors that they ' re keeping pace with rising rates , some banks and thrifts now tie money market rates to a specific index . Citisavings in San Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the 90-day Treasury bill . Changes in Florida Federal ' s rate on its Liquidity Plus money market account are linked to a seven-day average for the federal funds rate , which is the rate on reserves that banks lend one another overnight . The indexed rates , along with high promotional rates for a limited period , are an " effort to hold onto money market account money for a longer period of time , " says Robert Heady , publisher of Bank Rate Monitor , a newsletter . The highest rates aren ' t always advertised . Irving Trust does some mail solicitation based on lists of subscribers to such publications as Money magazine and Forbes.  --  - Table High Yields by Mail A sampling of rates on bank money market accounts Minimum Bank Rate Deposit Telephone No .
