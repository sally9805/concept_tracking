Jaruzelski swiftly puts down the protest against the banning of Solidarity <P> It was a makeshift sign hanging over the entrance to the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk , but the message in black letters was plain and specific : SOLIDARITY LIVES . Three days before , Poland 's parliament had passed a law formally abolishing the independent trade union , yet , as the simple banner at the union 's Baltic birthplace made eloquently clear , Solidarity supporters were not yet ready to bury all the aspirations and hope that had been inspired by the reform movement , however powerful the suasions and muscle of Poland 's military regime . In Gdansk and other cities across the country last week , the union 's supporters protested Solidarity 's demise and ten months of martial law with a spontaneous wave of strikes and demonstrations . <P> For a brief moment , at least , the scenes of defiance and hope recalled the exhilarating mood of August 1980 , when Solidarity was born . In recent months Poles had staged symbolic work stoppages and street demonstrations to protest the imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers arriving for the first shift at the Lenin shipyard wanted action : they called a wildcat strike . Before long , Gate No. 2 , scene of so much activity two years earlier as Solidarity grew into a force that shook the Communist bloc , was once again covered with red-and-white national banners , papal portraits and flowers . As strikers in drab blue overalls and hard hats chanted slogans , Poles massed outside to cheer them on , tossing bouquets , cigarettes and food through the iron fence . Emboldened by the crowd , workers renamed the shipyard Solidarity , daubing the union 's name in a crude graffiti scrawl across the bottom of huge white letters spelling LENIN on a sign above the entrance . <P> A brave beginning , and one that surprised U.S. analysts by its strength , but despite the evident similarity to the events of 1980 , history did not repeat itself in Gdansk last week . General Wojciech Jaruzelski , head of the military regime , made it clear from the first flicker of protest that his government would not give an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other groups across Poland , the generals quickly cut telephone and telex lines to the troubled port . Convoys of police and ZOMO , the paramilitary police force , roared into Gdansk , turning the city into an armed camp . When the strikes stretched on for two days , riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse crowds that gathered on the square outside the shipyard . As flames lighted the night sky , police battled youths who blockaded streets with bonfires and trash cans . <P> Under attack in the streets and besieged in the shipyard , the strikers had no leader of the caliber of the imprisoned Lech Walesa to organize an effective challenge to Warsaw 's might . Working through clandestine committees , union activists drafted a list of demands for the government , calling for the release of Walesa and other internees , an end to martial law , and the revival of Solidarity . Without a formal strike committee to coordinate activities , the initiative faltered .                @ @ @ @ @
