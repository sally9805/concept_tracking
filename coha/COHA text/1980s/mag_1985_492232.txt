Antony had his Cleopatra , King Arthur his Guinevere ; Winston Churchill loved Clementine and it 's no secret President Reagan adores his Nancy . From Paris to Tokyo , the world is aware that a great romance of history is occurring in our White House . The President 's devotion to Nancy shines through every time they are seen holding hands , exchanging glances or greeting each other . When I went to the White House for an interview with Nancy Reagan , I took a copy of a framed quote I 'd had printed 30 years ago to give to my husband for Christmas . It was taken from remarks Winston Churchill once made about his wife , Clementine . I felt Churchill 's magnificent prose might express how our First Lady feels about her own husband : When Mrs. Reagan finished reading it , I asked her if she felt the words described her feeling for the President . She smiled and said : " That 's very nice , and yes , that 's how I would describe my husband . " of July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been a good year for our country 's First Couple .

None of this was news to the Post . The Reagans ' romance has been displayed on our covers as far back as 1974 .

At the tender age of 14 , she is said to have consulted a judge , a neighbor in her parents ' Phoenix apartment com  --  plex , to inquire if she could " adopt " her stepfather . The amused judge smiled and told her he thought that could be arranged . He knew that Dr. Davis had long wanted to officially adopt Nancy but preferred that she make the decision . To know more about the man who had had this profound influence in shaping her life , I reviewed several books by and about Dr. Loyal Davis .

" for his work and his integrity in fighting to correct a social injustice . I brought Mrs. Reagan a January 16 , 1954 , copy of The Saturday Evening Past containing an article and a picture of her now deceased stepfather with the story of his crusade against an evil of his day  --  fee splitting among doctors . It was entitled " Patients for Sale . " She glowed with pride at the sight of her handsome stepfather 's picture in the article , which told of his bat  --  tle against fee splitting by physicians in that era and his determination to rid the American Medical Associa  --  tion and the American College of Surgeons of any members who would participate in this practice . His vehemence brought some con  --  troversy , but not from those who knew the dangers of such an ominous practice . His position earned him criticism even from the AMA , but he was right and he knew it , and he won the respect of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil out in the open . During the interview , Mrs. Reagan spoke enthusiastically of the victories won in her drug-abuse pro  --  gram , of the increased drug aware  --  ness and the rise of parent organ  --  izations . Our government could n't have produced a more effective dynamo to spearhead the global undertaking she has launched . Since the First Lady is n't on any govern  --  ment payroll , to my knowledge , this probably makes her the No . I volunteer in the country . How much of her stepfather 's crusading nature had been passed along to his only daughter ? I asked . " He influenced me in many , many ways , " she said . " He was just a great influence on my life . " " And did you develop your con  --  cern for health and drugs from his example ? " I asked . " I got interested in the drug-abuse problem in the ' 60s when it all started and we were all so un  --  prepared and knew nothing . . nothing ! You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything  --  this was a whole brand-new problem , and we were told that marijuana was n't Nancy Reagan 's fight against drug abuse went international in April as first ladies from around the world came to the United States to attend her " summit conference " in Washington . Here , she and other first ladies visit a meeting of PRIDE , or Parents ' Resource Institute for Drug Education , Inc. iroceeds from her book and her record , both titled To Love A Child , will go to support the Foster Grandparents Program , which Mrs. Reagan began promoting as the California governor 's wife more than a decade ago . anything . " " Why do you think that hap  --  pened ? " I asked her . " We were taught 20 years ago in medical school that marijuana damages the brain  --  that you ca n't drive as well under the influence of marijuana  --  and yet the press was persistent about its harmlessness . Why ? " " Well , there was a report from Washington that it was harmless , " she replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " 1 do n't know , I was n't here , " she said with a laugh . " This was n't the press , this was the government . The government put out the report . " " Even so , I never could under stand , in the face of all the evidence to the contrary , why the press kept being so soft about it , " I persisted . She hesitated briefly . " Well , in the very beginning , the only thing 1 can think of is that it was because of these doctors who were involved with that report the report from Dr. James L. Goddard , then com  --  missioner of the FDA ) . They have all done a complete turnaround and now see it as it is , and have refuted what they said in the beginning . But it had a tremendous influence on a lot of kids who kept referring to this article and saying , ' You know , it 's no more harmful than a glass of wine or something . ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think the danger of co  --  caine is being underplayed too ? " I asked . " You know that if you sniff it long enough you may end up with only one nostril instead of two ? Your septum is gone . it can be very dangerous . Do you think it 's still downplayed ? " " Oh no , I do n't think so , " she responded . " I think no . I think that one of the good things about what we 've been doing is that we 've brought the attention level to where it should be , and that makes me very happy . " " In your drug studies , have you been reading about dip and snuff ? Stamp out snuff ! is that part of your campaign ? " I asked . " Well , it 's at the periphery . I mean , it 's an offshoot to the whole new drug thing . " I shared with Mrs. Reagan our appalling discoveries at the Chil  --  dren 's Better Health Institute , where our editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling how they discovered the use of snuff and dip even by their preschoolers . An example was Rhonda Atkins , a nurse from Oklahoma whose five  --  year-old asked her to get him some dip . When she returned with onion dip , he said , " Oh no , mommy , not that . " Whereupon he led her to the smokeless-tobacco section and I f presidents grow in office , so do first ladies . Nancy Reagan , who once preferred not to make speeches , now steps up to podiums around the world and makes hundreds of appearances and interviews yearly to get her point across  --  drugs and kids do n't mix . pointed to the dip he was using . She berated the grocer for having sold dip to young children . When she finished , the grocer just smiled and said , " Well , lady , it 's not against the law . " Then she saw to it that her state passed a law prohibiting selling or giving it to minors . Mrs. Reagan nodded and said , " You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . That 's where mothers and fathers can be so valuable . Once they get informed and knowledgeable and involved with their children 's lives , they can do things like that ! " And now the parents ' groups have grown tremendously  --  not only in that area , but they 've been a wonderful support system for each other , because in the ' 60s and the ' 70s they were self-conscious about drugs . You know , they thought their child was the only child on drugs ; they were embarrassed and theydid n't know too much either . " Now there 's a little bit of that because you go through a denial period , usually with a parent and a child . The parent will say , ' Not my child , ' you know , ' not my child  --  my child could n't be on drugs , ' or the child will say : ' Not me ! ' But after you get past that , then they are very good support systems for each other . They can talk , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get involved with their children 's lives . If the child comes home and says Johnny is having a party on Saturday night , the parent will call Johnny 's parents and ask : ' Is Johnny having a party Saturday night , and are you going to be there and , of course , no liquor ? ' Then the parents ' groups spread out and they get involved with what 's going on at school and in the neighborhood . They 're very effective . " " What new projects have you planned ? " 1 asked . " Well , you know , we had the 17 First Ladies from different coun  --  tries , because I think people have got to realize , and it 's important to stress , that this is a global problem . It 's not just here ; it 's all over . I think we have raised the level of awareness here , and we 'll keep that up . And now we want to reach out to those other countries because many of them are just now becom  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them by what you 've learned , maybe they can avoid some pitfalls . " The First Lady 's crusade is raising the drug awareness of people around the world . Ten years ago " drugs " was a dirty word . It was like smoking  --  many people did n't want to talk about it . Mrs. Reagan has said many times that we are not going to resolve the problem by eradicating drugs from our culture or by preventing the flow of drugs into this country . Designer drugs can be formulated in the basement of anyone 's house . And you ca n't make inhalants , such as glue , illegal . You can make the selling of " dip " to minors illegal in Oklahoma , but there is always that 21-year-old who will go in and buyit for some children . Mrs. Reagan believes the answer is to do away with demand . She says that exposing children to anti  --  drug abuse literature at a very early age is what gives them a value system and a set of standards that they can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to changing attitudes toward drug abuse . Mrs. Reagan told of her campaign called " Just Say NO ! " A public-relations campaign by the ad council for the Department of Health and Human Services , it was directed at fourth- and fifth-graders in a high-crime area in Oakland , California . The program had such an impact that at one elementary school small children started a club called the " Just Say NO ! " club . The club began to grow , and on April 29 of this year 2,000 members in the D.C. area marched to the White House to be greeted by Mrs. Reagan . Simul  --  taneous marches in 15 different cities produced 30,000 kids march  --  ing and carrying posters . It looked like a protest  --  and it really was , a " Just Say NO ! " protest to drugs . Next year , on May 24 , the end of the school year , it is estimated that 5 million of these elementary-school kids , with Mrs. Reagan 's support , will be marching in a protest to drugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth- and fifth-grade levels , if it is to be beaten . One of the men who travels with Mrs. Reagan explains her rapport with the children : " I 've done so many events where , after the cameras are off and the media leave , she 's back there with the kids . It happened like that when the kids were touring the detention center at Tulsa . The class was sitting in the courtroom listening to the judge brief them about what happens to kids who get involved with drugs and are convicted of a crime as a juvenile . It was a great event and the kids listened closely . But there were the cameras and photographers and tons of equipment . When we walked out of the courtroom and the camera people went to set up in continued on page 104 Nancy Reagan continued from page 59 another location , Nancy Reagan was out in the hallway with the kids , total  --  ly oblivious to anything or anyone , except them . The kids completely sur  --  rounded her . And they open up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain ability to communicate with them . I 've never seen it fail . " ? ? ? As everyone knows , the President and Mrs. Reagan look years younger than their age . " How do you and the President keep so wonderfully fit ? " I asked her . " I think that I can tell you very easily . We have always led a very ac  --  tive life physically . We have a ranch , and California lends itself to outdoor living . So it 's different coming back here where you have no exercise at all  --  none ; you do n't walk , you do n't do anything . You walk out of here and get into a car and you are driven someplace , except for the weekends at Camp David . " 1 think that exercise is very , very important . I think obviously you look better , you feel better , you work bet ? ter ; everything is just better and doc  --  tors will certainly tell you it 's better . In order to get exercise , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor , I will walk instead of tak  --  ing the elevator , but I will walk two steps at a time . " " Do you play tennis ? " " No , I do n't play tennis . I used to play tennis before I got married , but my husband does n't play tennis , so we ride . " " Do you swim together a lot ? Is that part of your exercise regimen ? " " At Camp David , but not here . " " Why ? The pool just is n't private ? " " It 's so far away , and it 's not real  --  ly private and it 's a very limited period that you can swim in Washing  --  ton ; it 's not like California . " " Oh , it 's an outdoor pool ? " " It 's heated , but it 's still outdoors , and the weather gets pretty cold here . " " Is it true that when you were first married your father suggested that just in case you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ? " " Yes , we do . " " Did your father tell you anything about vitamin C or not to smoke ? " " Ronnie has never smoked . And when we got married , I was what you would call a social smoker . If we went out , I would smoke at nighttime , but I never smoked in the daytime . If we stayed home , I never smoked at night . When Bob Taylor died  --  he was the godfather of our son and we were the godparents of his daugh  --  ter  --  I stopped even that much . I was never really a real smoker . " ( Editor 's note : Robert Taylor smoked , and died from cancer  --  so too the Holly  --  wood performers Nat King Cole , John Wayne , Betty Grable , Gary Cooper and Humphrey Bogart . ) " I 've read that nicotine is the most addictive drug , and it 's the hardest drug addiction to break , " I added . " I guess it is . I have very good friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she replied . " Did your father teach you any other good preventive-health prac  --  tices , like telling you about fiber and how to prevent a dowager 's hump by taking enough calcium ? " I asked . " Yes . He told me about calcium , eating properly , exercise . One of his favorites was : ' You have to exercise your brain as well as your body . Your brain is a muscle just like the muscles in your body , and if you do n't keep it exercised , it will atrophy . . . " " Did you go to some medical meet  --  ings with him and ever think that maybe you 'd be doing anything in medicine ? " " Yes , I used to go watch him oper  --  ate . I did that a lot , and I did nurse's-aide work at hospitals . " In addition to her nurse's-aide work , Mrs. Reagan has had several hospital vigils in her life  --  when the President was shot , when her father lay dying and , recently , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stayed with him in the hospital , she kept his spirits up and she only let down when she went back to the White House . She did n't want him to see her cry . Through her sheer strength and force of will she helped him to get better and helped him during the convalescence . She gave strength to him , and her strength has come from her tremendous faith . She has written in her autobiogra  --  phy : " God must have loved me a lot to have given him to me . . . . We both have faith in God and believe He has a plan for each of us. "
