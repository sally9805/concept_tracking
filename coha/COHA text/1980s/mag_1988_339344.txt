THE FIRST SALUTE <P> by Barbara W. Tuchman <P> Knoph ; 347 pages ; $22.95 <P> From the British point of view , the American revolutionaries were ingrates . Had not the mother country endowed her colonists with a splendid heritage ? Did she not , at considerable cost , literally save their scalps from the French and their Iroquois allies during the Seven Years ' War ? The litany of disappointment went on , driven by royal self-righteousness and a scarcely concealed craving to punish the upstarts . <P> So George III and his ministers were even more distressed when , on Nov. 16 , 1776 , the Andrew Doria , a lightly armed brigantine flying the flag of the Continental Congress , was greeted by an eleven-gun salute from the fort guarding the main harbor of the Dutch West Indian island of St. Eustatius . Legitimizing the rebels with this ritual act was particularly galling because the Caribbean port was used , despite repeated British protests , to supply American troops with gunpowder and shot . St. Eustatius was Holland 's " Golden Rock , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch greeting is regarded as the first formal recognition of American nationhood by a foreign official . But to suggest that a maritime salutation could set in motion events that altered the world would seem to require a well-stocked imagination and a keen dramatic instinct . Readers of The Guns of August ( 1962 ) , The Proud Tower ( 1966 ) and A Distant Mirror ( 1978 ) have good reason to know that Barbara Tuchman possesses both in abundance . Yet she has never reduced history to simple causes and effects . Her books resemble jigsaw puzzles : start anywhere with any fragment and one can eventually assemble the whole . <P> Tuchman 's view of history is gravely classical . She is a tragedian who mounts the past against the fixed backdrop of human nature . Reason and goodwill exist but are like the stars in the heavens : flashes of enlightenment separated by vast expanses of darkness . " Halfway ' between truth and endless error , ' " she concludes , " the mold of the species is permanent . " <P> The First Salute is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no re-enactments of Paul Revere 's ride , no echoes of the shot heard round the world . Instead , the critical naval battle in Chesapeake Bay and Washington 's victory ( with essential French aid ) over Cornwallis at Yorktown are presented in the context of political decisions and misjudgments made thousands of miles across the Atlantic . Young America produced an unusual number of intelligent and bold leaders , but , to Tuchman , the success of its war of independence rested largely on the outcome of European struggles for colonies and commerce . <P> The balance of power in the 18th century depended on the weight and professionalism of one 's navy . Tuchman devotes a great deal of space and vivid prose to the subject , from ship design to armaments and tactics . Her conclusion : England 's vaunted sea force was crippled by poor leadership , corruption and an inflexible manual known as Fighting Instructions , deviation from which could and did get captains court-martialed.
