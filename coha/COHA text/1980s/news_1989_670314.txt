SEOUL , South Korea  --  The boy wonder of the Korean computer industry overlooks Seoul from behind a massive marble-top desk high in a 63-story office tower . The 38-year-old B.C. Lee puffs his chest a little as he tells of having introduced microcomputers to Korea , a country that now makes many of the world ' s personal computers . " I developed this market , " boasts Mr. Lee , who made a $20 million personal fortune through a computer company he founded eight years ago . " And I think I ' m entitled to share in the profits . " The Korean economic miracle usually conjures up the giant " chaebol "  --  industrial conglomerates like Hyundai , Daewoo and Samsung . But after being ignored for years , a cadre of Korean entrepreneurs running small start-up companies suddenly are the focus of attention of government planners . " Big companies have dominated our economy , " says Park In Gu , assistant director of the Ministry of Trade and Industry ' s small-industry division . " But small companies react more quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee to replay the successes of Americans such as Apple Computer Inc. founder Steven Jobs and Microsoft founder William Gates . Small Korean start-ups sell computers to the U.S. and software to Japan and are developing a Korean market for U.S. software . Now , government planners are hoping such entrepreneurial whizzes will inspire innovation in a country that depends largely on copying the West ' s and Japan ' s technologies . A look at three Koreans gives a glimpse of the kind of entrepreneurs that Korea will be unleashing on the world ' s technology markets : The Successful Innovator Ask any Korean electronics executive to name an innovative start-up and he ' ll probably point to Qnix Co. , the company founded by B.C. Lee . Known for its creative atmosphere and heavy investment in research  --  15% of sales last year  --  Qnix uses high salaries to lure graduates from Korea ' s top universities . Mr. Lee didn ' t pay his employees anything at all in 1981 when he spent everything he had on a soldering iron , a microcomputer and an oscilloscope . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Watson Laboratory in Yorktown Heights , N.Y. , Mr. Lee set up shop in a tiny second-floor office in Seoul that , he says , was " little better than a garage . " He and three employees worked seven-day weeks , sleeping on mattresses in the office and bathing at the neighborhood bath house . " We were crazy , " Mr. Lee says . Crazy and broke . By 1983 Qnix had $200 , 000 in debt , no assets and only a puny market for its computer systems . But paranoia at then President Chun Doo Hwan ' s mansion brought a windfall . Worried that his cabinet briefing memos would leak to the public from the shop where they were printed , Mr. Chun decided that in-house computers should do the task secretly . Only Qnix had the necessary Korean-language software . " We were lucky , " says Mr. Lee . " It made us famous and prosperous in one swoop . " Mr. Lee ' s company went on to create systems for big Korean companies , including Hyundai Electronics Co . Packaging laser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has brought booming sales . Qnix ' s estimated 1988 sales are $19 million , up 78% over last year and six times 1983 sales . But by 1986 , Qnix had become too big and successful for Mr. Lee . He reshuffled management by hiring a Goldstar Co. executive and voluntarily eased himself out , though he is still an adviser to Qnix and retains a minority interest . Last year , Mr. Lee moved to his current opulent office as president of the Korean subsidiary of Microsoft Corp. of Redmond , Wash . He owns 49% of Korean Microsoft ' s shares ; Microsoft owns 51% . By marketing Microsoft ' s software , much of which has become the de facto standard for personal computers world-wide , " I can accelerate Korean industry , " he figures . " We can help computer manufacturers in Korea to be successful all over the world . " The Mid-Career Man A company that won ' t much need that help is TriGem Computer Inc . If that name doesn ' t ring a bell , try Computerland , Blue Chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops sell TriGem personal computers and that have helped fuel TriGem ' s 374% average annual sales growth . Behind TriGem ' s success is Kim Jong Kil , a buttoned-down , 47-year-old Korean who masterminded the company after a 15-year career at Goldstar , where he managed a cash-register factory . While still at Goldstar , he persuaded his wealthy brother-in-law to found TriGem and install him at its helm . Like Qnix ' s Mr. Lee , Mr. Kim began in 1981 in a postage-stamp Seoul office where five employees wielded soldering irons . Mr. Kim ' s first year was a disaster . TriGem cloned a computer made by Japan ' s Sharp Corp. and produced 30 of them using electronics parts that Mr. Kim bought in Seoul ' s electronics bazaar . Peddling the machines around Korea , he sold only 10 . The turning point came a year later when Mr. Kim learned of Apple Computer ' s wild success from Koreans who started bringing the machines back from the U.S. TriGem quickly cloned the Apple II personal computer , the first Korean company to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1982 , the Korean government ordered Korean institutions to buy domestically made machines and named five official suppliers : four chaebol companies and tiny TriGem . That helped boost TriGem ' s sales to 3 , 000 machines in 1983 from 1982 sales of 300 machines . And TriGem continued its cloning success when it became the first Korean company to introduce a machine compatible with IBM ' s personal computer in 1984 , a feat that made TriGem " the Compaq of Korea , " says a Korean electronics official . ( Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston grew rapidly after successfully cloning IBM PCs . ) TriGem ' s success attracted financing from two government venture-capital funds , which now own 22% of the company . Epson subsequently granted TriGem a contract to make Epson ' s Equity line of computers and bought a 20% interest in TriGem in 1987 . The tie-up has paid off . TriGem now makes 45 , 000 PCs a month and estimates 1988 sales at $197 million , up from $78 million in 1987 . It estimates 1988 exports at $134 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean newspaper calls Cho Hyun Jung the symbol of " a new generation of awesome young brains " whose company is the " Apple Computer Co. of Korea . " Another paper calls him " the boy president of a potential computer chaebol . " The plaudits probably exaggerate the success of the 31-year-old Mr. Cho and his BIT Computer Co. , a small software house that did $2. 2 million in sales in 1988 . But that is double the previous year ' s sales . And such growth makes software experts like Mr. Cho the darlings of Korea ' s technology bureaucrats , who have identified software as a target for Korean industry . Bureaucrats and electronics executives figure that Korea ' s well-educated youth can create a thriving software industry that exports world-wide . " We want more companies like this to come out  --  hundreds of them , " says a computer executive . " The software infrastructure is weak and we must encourage companies like BIT . " BIT ' s exports include programs such as home-banking software for Japan and a program that analyzes skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded his company in 1983 at age 26 , " I didn ' t have the money and I didn ' t have the social background , " he admits . He was born in a small town far from Seoul , where he wasn ' t able to go to the top-name schools from which Korean business draws its elite . His father died when he was eight , and Mr. Cho had to work as a radio and television technician to put himself through school . Graduating from college with an electronics engineering degree , he bought an Apple II clone and rented a room in a cheap Seoul hotel , where he lived and worked with his few employees designing programs to make computer hard disks more efficient in storing data . Two years later he moved into bigger quarters and soon began combining his software with IBM computers . Industry recognition came when IBM awarded BIT the status of " Systems Remarketer , " which allows a third-party vendor to package its software with IBM computers in Korea . That put tiny BIT alongside big companies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which also remarket IBM systems . Unlike the big companies , Mr. Cho boasts , " we have the good ideas and the skill that lets us move more quickly to adapt to the international situation .
