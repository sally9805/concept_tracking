Southern Air Transport , once a front company owned by the Central Intelligence Agency and used for covert supply runs in Asia , is a common thread in two supply programs for Nicaraguan rebels - one official and humanitarian , the other a private weapons network . The two operations are woven so closely together they are sometimes difficult to separate. // // In an elaborate shadow dance , the secret arms supply network used much the same organization , and sometimes different legs of the same plane trips , as the official nonlethal aid program. // American officials monitored and promoted the arms network , the evidence suggests , and even indirectly subsidized it , but always one step removed from official involvement. // Or almost always . The diverting of Iranian arms payments to the contras crossed over into direct government support and may have broken laws barring such support last year. // Whether or not government involvement slipped its leash elsewhere in the contra supply program is not yet clear .

As of this fall , Southern Air ' s fleet is seven times as large as the three Hercules cargo planes it operated in 1983 . Company revenues have grown at roughly the same pace . About half of Southern Air ' s contracts are with the Military Airlift Command. // Much of Southern Air ' s growth follows the growth of the supply networks to the contras , who have located an office across from the Southern Air hangar. // Both Southern Air and the contra organization deny that there is any relationship .
