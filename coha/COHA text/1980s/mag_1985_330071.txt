In a 64-page charge that took two hours to read , Federal Judge Abraham Sofaer outlined the complex issues that the four women and two men on the jury had to evaluate . In reaching a verdict on former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon 's $50 million libel suit against Time Inc. , he explained , they faced three sets of questions about a single paragraph in TIME 's Feb. 21 , 1983 , cover story about an official Israeli report on the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in West Beirut . First , could the disputed passage , which reported on discussions Sharon had with Lebanese Christian Phalangist leaders prior to the massacre , be interpreted as having a meaning that defamed Sharon ? If so , was the substance of the paragraph false ? And if the answers to both these questions were yes , did TIME publish the paragraph " with a high degree of awareness " of its probable falsity ? For Sharon to win his suit , the jury would have to answer yes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of testimony , find that his reputation had been damaged by the story . <P> In an unusual move , Sofaer asked the jury to report publicly their answers at each stage . After 14 hours of deliberations , the jury announced on Wednesday that it had found for Sharon on the first question . The paragraph , said the jury , implied that Sharon " consciously intended " to permit the Phalangists to take revenge by deliberately killing noncombatants in the camps . It took the jury an additional 20 hours of deliberation , which continued through Friday afternoon , to find that the disputed paragraph was in fact false . At week 's end the jurors were still debating the question of malice . <P> $ TIME 's cover story dealt with the report of a commission headed by Israel 's Supreme Court President Yitzhak Kahan . The killings , which began two days after the assassination of Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel , were carried out by Phalangist militiamen . The Kahan commission concluded that Sharon had ordered the militiamen into the camps and thus bore " indirect responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days after the findings were released . <P> The paragraph at issue in Sharon 's lawsuit comes halfway through the eight- page story ; it described a condolence call Sharon paid to the Gemayel family the day after Bashir 's death and said that information about the visit was contained in a classified Appendix B to the report . The passage went on to say : " Sharon reportedly told the Gemayels that the Israeli army would be moving into West Beirut and that he expected the Christian forces to go into the Palestinian refugee camps . Sharon also reportedly discussed with the Gemayels the need for the Phalangists to take revenge for the assassination of Bashir , but the details of the conversation are not known .
