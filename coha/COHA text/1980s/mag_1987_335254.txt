After 39 years as mayor of Smyrna , Tenn. ( pop . 12,000 ) , John Sam Ridley could hardly separate his personal business from the town 's . He used his city credit card to visit a daughter in Texas , vacation in Florida and attend the Southern Baptist Convention , claiming that as mayor he was on duty 24 hours a day . He and his brother Knox , a former judge , owned Smyrna 's Chevrolet dealership , which serviced cars for the city . A conflict-of-interest suit filed against Sam dragged on for seven years , through two of his re-elections . Then , facing an impending decree from a judge that he leave office , the mayor abruptly resigned this month . <P> But Smyrna 's dynasty survives . The five-member town commission took all of ten minutes to name Brother Knox to fill out the remaining 2 1/2 years of Sam 's term . Said Knox : " Sam will be my right arm . " Municipal policies will remain unchanged , and voters may not even notice that a new man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , now with the same type eyeglasses and portly build , Sam and Knox are identical twins .
