 | " Does Father know ? " she asked . " Lord Peace is in Lakon , " said Angel . " Whether he knows or not is no help to you here . " She knelt quickly beneath the ikon that was her room 's only decoration . It was a shimmering engraving of the starship Konkeptoine , cut into bright green crystal . It was worth more than the price of a poor man 's house . Patience liked the contrast between the deliberate poverty of her room and the opulence of her religious display . The priests would call it piety . She thought of it as irony . Patience murmured the Come Kristos in eight seconds  --  she had it down to a science  --  kissed her fingers and touched them to the Konkeptoine . The crystal was warm . After all these years , still alive . No doubt it was almost hot when her mother touched it , when she was a girl . And long before Patience would have a daughter , it would be cold and dead , the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . " Tell me the task King Oruc has set for me . " " I do n't know . Only that he called for you . But you can guess , ca n't you ? " Angel was testing her , of course . It was the story of her life , test after test . She complained about it , sometimes , but the truth was she enjoyed it , took pleasure in solving the diplomatic puzzles that Father and Angel constantly put to her . So  --  what could King Oruc want her to do ? The Heptarch had never called for her before . She had often been in Heptagon House , of course , but only when summoned to play with one of the Heptarch 's children , never to perform a task for the Heptarch himself . Which was to be expected . At the age of thirteen , she was hardly old enough to expect a calling from the King . Yesterday , though , an embassy had arrived from Tassali , a kingdom in the East which , in ancient times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Korfu . That meant little : All seven parts of the world had once been ruled by the Heptarchy , and Tassali had been free of Korfu for a thousand years . Prekeptor , the only prince and heir presumptive of Tassali , a sixteen-year-old boy , had come with an array of high-ranking Tassaliki and very expensive gifts . From this information Patience had already concluded the obvious  --  that the embassy was there to conclude a marriage treaty with one of King Oruc 's three daughters . The dowry had no doubt been negotiated a year ago , before the embassy set out . One does not send a royal heir to meet the bride until  | most of the details of the treaty are set . But Patience could guess easily enough that one remaining point of negotiation was bound to be the question : Which daughter ? Lyra , the eldest daughter , fourteen years old and second in line to the Heptarchy ? Rika , who was only a year younger than Patience and easily the brightest of the Heptarch 's children ? Or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly old enough to be married off if politics demanded it ? Patience could think of only one task she might perform in connection with this visit . She was fluent in Tassalik , and she seriously doubted that Prince Prekeptor spoke a word of Agarant . They were quite provincial in Tassali and clung to their dialect tenaciously . If a meeting were to take place between Prekeptor and one of Oruc 's daughters , Patience would be an excellent interpreter . And since Klea was an unlikely candidate and Rika could speak passable Tassalik , it was most likely that the chosen daughter was Lyra . All this reasoning took place while Patience pulled on her silk chemise . She turned to face Angel then , and smiled . " I 'm to be the interpreter between Prekeptor and Lyra , when they meet today so they can decide whether they detest each other so much it is worth causing an international quarrel to avoid being married . " Angel smiled . " It seems the most likely thing . " " Then I must dress to take part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Nails and Calico to me ? " " I will , " said Angel . But he stopped at the door . " You must realize , " he said , " that Prekeptor will know who you are . " It was a warning , and Patience understood very well that King Oruc was playing a dangerous game , putting her in the middle of a political situation so closely involved with royal succession . Especially with Father away . Oruc must have planned this for some time , to have Father away on a trivial matter . Ordinarily , Lord Peace would have been at the heart of the negotiations over such a vital alliance . Nails and Calico , her dressing maids , came in , trying to seem light and cheerful , when obviously they had been aroused from deep  --  and , in Calico 's case , drunken  --  slumber . Patience selected her gown and wig and endured their ministrations as they turned her into a poppet . " Called to the King , " Nails kept saying . " What honor , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have her father called a slave over and over again , but she knew that Nails was not being malicious , merely stupid . And as Father always said , Never be angry when fools behave like fools . It 's  | better when fools identify themselves , Patience reminded herself . It removes so much uncertainty . When the women were finished , the sun was just coming up . She dismissed them and opened the small brass case that contained the diplomatic equipment Father and Angel had decided she was old enough to use discreetly . For self-defense , a loop , of course . It was a long strand of incredibly strong plastic , so fine that it was almost invisible . It could cut through flesh with only a little pressure . It had knobs of plastic on both ends , so Patience could grasp it without slicing off her fingers . And for attack , a glass pendant which contained a swarm of pinks , almost invisibly tiny insects that homed in on human eyes and in a matter of minutes would build honeycomb nests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were not removed quickly , the pinks would bore through to the brain and cause chronic , permanent palsy . A vicious weapon , but Angel always said that a diplomat who is not prepared to kill had better be prepared to die . She tipped back her head and put drops in her eyes , of a liquid that would kill pinks on contact . It would stay in her eyes for hours . As Father said , Never carry a weapon that can be used against you . As she prepared herself , she tried to figure out what King Oruc had in mind for her . There were other interpreters he could use . The choice of Patience was fraught with implications , especially if Prekeptor knew who she really was . There was no circumstance Patience could think of where anything would be helped by using her as interpreter ; and she could think of dozens of things that might go wrong , to have the daughter of Lord Peace standing beside the daughter of King Oruc , when the heir to a powerful kingdom came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout her childhood that she was not an ordinary slave in the Heptarch 's household . One of the first lessons a child in King 's Hill had to learn was to treat each slave according to the strictest protocols of rank . Whores and chamberslaves needed no more respect than dogs ; ambassadors and ministers of state , like her father , Peace , were treated with as much honor as any lord except the Heptarch himself or the heads of the Fourteen Families . But even among the children of the most noble of the King 's slaves , Patience was given special treatment . Adults whispered when they saw her ; many of them surreptitiously found opportunities to touch her lips with the back of a hand , as if in a symbolic kiss . She had told Father of this one day when she was five . He immediately grew stern . " If anyone does it again , tell me at once . But better  | than tell afterward , try to stand away from them , and not give them an opportunity . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong . " No , child , " said Father . " First , do not show me that you are afraid and ashamed . Your face must never show such things . " She relaxed her face , as her tutor , Angel , had taught her . " And second , " said Father , " you have done nothing wrong . But for these adults , who should know better , to do such things is ? " Patience expected him to say something like " wrong " or " sinful , " because the priests had been hinting about certain things that people did with children 's bodies that were very bad . So she was startled when he said , " Treason . " " Treason ? " How would it injure the Heptarch to touch the lips of the daughter of a slave ? Father studied her calmly , then said , " I have decided you can know , now , or else you wo n't be able to protect yourself against these thoughtless traitors . Your grandfather was Heptarch until the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was only five . She knew something of the laws of succession , but it did not occur to her to apply them to herself . Father pointedly glanced toward the parlor , where the servants would be listening . All the servants except Angel were chosen by the King , and frankly spied for him . Father smiled at her and said , " How is your Geblic ? " Then he wrote in Geblic on a piece of paper : Compose a brief letter to this person : Agaranthamoi Heptest She had been trained in the protocols of names and titles from her first words . The labyrinthine network of precedence , rank , and royal favor was second nature to her . So were all the ins and outs of the royal titles . The surname of the ruling Heptarch 's family was always rooted in Hept ; the forename of any person of royal blood was always rooted in Agaranth . She also knew that only the ruling Heptarch could bear the surname Heptest , and Agaranthamoi meant " eldest son and only child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had no brothers or sisters . Since Oruc , the ruling Heptarch , had several siblings , his dynastic name was Agaranthikil . This could not possibly be his name , and to call any living person but Oruc by the surname Heptest was treason .  | But the test was not merely to decipher the meaning of the names , she knew . Father had just told her that her grandfather was ruling Heptarch all his life , and Father was his only child . Therefore Agaranthamoi was a perfectly proper forename for him . Father was telling her that he was the rightful King of Korfu . So she wrote a short letter : Agaranthamoi Heptest , Lord and Father : Your unworthiest daughter begs you to be discreet , for to utter your name is death . Humbly , Agaranthemem Heptek Her hand trembled as she signed this strange name for the first time . Agaranthemem meant " eldest daughter and only child . " Heptek meant " heir to the reigning Heptarch . " It was a name as treasonable as the one her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow , in the movement of history , her father had been deprived of his throne , and she of her place as his heir . It was a staggering burden for a child of five to bear . But she was Patience , the daughter of Lord Peace and pupil of Angel the Almost-Wise , and in the eight years since then she had never once uttered either name , or given the slightest sign to anyone , by word or act , to show that she knew what her rank and birthright ought to be . Father burned the paper with their names on it , and combed the ashes to dust . Ever since that day , Patience had . watched her father , trying to determine what his life meant . For King Oruc had no more faithful and loyal slave than Lord Peace , the man who should be Heptarch . Even in private , even when no one could hear , Father often said to her , " Child , King Oruc is the best Heptarch the world could hope for at this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings to the world Imakulata , it has never been more important to maintain a King on his throne than it is , today , to preserve King Oruc . " He meant it . He did everything he could to prove to her that he meant it . It caused her untold agony of heart , trying to discover why Father gave such love and loyalty to the man who exercised power and received honor that by rights should have belonged to Lord Peace . Was Father so weak that he could not even reach for what ought to be his own ? Once , when she was ten years old , she hinted to him of how this  | question perplexed her . And his only answer was to place his fingers on her lips , not as some traitors had done , to receive the kiss of blessing from the mouth of the King 's daughter , but to silence her . Then , gazing intently into her eyes , he said for the first time : " The King cares only for the good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world . " That was the only answer she got from him . In the years since then , though , she had begun to grasp what he meant . That the Heptarch , the true Heptarch , always acted for the benefit of the whole world . Other lords could act to preserve their dynasty or enrich themselves , but the true Heptarch would even give up the Heptagon House and let a usurper rule in Heptam , the capital of Korfu  --  if , for some unfathom- ill able reason , such a thing was to the greater benefit of the whole world . What she could never understand was how her father 's displacement from his proper place benefited anyone . For as she grew more learned and skillful in the arts of diplomacy and government , observing the great public councils and hearing of the delicate negotiations and compromises that gathered ever more power to Heptagon House , she saw plainly that the most brilliant mind , the prime mover in consolidating King Oruc 's hold on Korfu , was Lord Peace . As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not complete . That someday , if she learned enough and thought enough , she would understand what Father was trying to do by working so loyally to keep the usurper in power . Now , however , she did not face so theoretical a problem . She was thirteen years old , far younger than the age at which a diplomatic career usually began , and King Oruc had called her to begin service . It was so obviously a trap that she almost believed his purpose might be innocent . What good could possibly come to King Oruc by inserting the rightful heir to the throne into the middle of a delicate dynastic negotiation ? How could it help Oruc to remind the Tassaliki that his own family had held the Heptagon House for a mere fifty years ? That there was a marriageable daughter of the original ruling family , whose claim to the Heptarchy went back hundreds of generations , five thousand years to the first human beings to set foot on Imakulata ? It was so reckless that it was hard to believe Oruc stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless . I will go where the King requests , do what the King desires , to accomplish the King 's hopes . He did not receive her in the public court . It was too early for that . Instead she was led to the Heptarch 's chambers , where the smell of the  | breakfast sausage still spiced the air . Oruc pretended not to notice her at first . He was engaged in intent conversation with the head of Lady Letheko , who had been his Constable until she died last year . She was the only one of the King 's household slaves who understood as much of the nuances of protocol as Lord Peace did ; in his absence , it was not surprising that King Oruc had ordered her head brought in from Slaves ' Hall to advise him during the visit of the Tassal embassy . " There may be no wine served , " Letheko insisted . She moved her mouth so vigorously that it set the whole jar moving . King Oruc let go of her air bladder to steady the jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head alive , or slopping messy fluids all over the fine rugs of the chamber floor . Deprived of air , she nevertheless kept moving her mouth , as if her argument was too important to wait for such a trifle as a voice . Oruc resumed pumping . " Unless you want them to think of you with contempt as a winebibber . They take their religion seriously , not like some people who act as if they thought Vigilants were mere ... " Again Oruc let her bladder run out of air . He waved a servant to take away Letheko 's head , and turned to Patience . " Lady Patience , " he said . " The Heptarch is kind to speak so nobly to the daughter of his lowest slave . " It was pro forma to talk that way , but Patience had her father 's knack of making the trite phrases of diplomatic speech sound sincere , as if they had never been spoken before . " How lovely , " said King Oruc . He turned to his wife , who was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love , and look at her . I heard she was a pretty girl , but I had no idea . " The Consort lifted her mirror . Patience saw in it the reflection of the woman 's pure hatred for her . Patience responded as if it had been a look of admiration , blushing and looking down . " Lovely , " said the Consort . " But her nose is too long . " " The Lady Consort is correct , " said Patience , sadly . " It was a fault in my mother 's face , but my father loved her anyway . " Father would have been annoyed at her for reminding them , however subtly , of her family connections . But her tone was so flawlessly modest that they could not - possibly take offense , and if the Consort continued in trying to provoke her , she would only make herself look increasingly boorish , even in the eyes of her husband . Oruc apparently reached the same conclusion . " Your hair is sufficiently beautiful for the needs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , you could go and see if Lyra is ready . "  | Patience noted , with satisfaction , that she had guessed correctly which daughter was meant to be the price of the Tassal treaty . She also enjoyed watching the Consort 's attempt at seeming regal as she stalked out of the room . Pathetic . King Oruc had obviously married beneath the dignity of his office . Still , she could understand the Consort 's hostility . By her very existence Patience was a threat to the Consort 's children . Of course she showed none of these thoughts to King Oruc . He saw nothing but a shy girl , waiting to hear why the King had called her . Especially he did not see how tense she was , watching his face so carefully that every second that passed seemed like a full minute , and every tiny motion of his eyebrow or lip seemed a great flamboyant gesture . He quickly told her all that she had already figured out , and ended with the command that she had expected . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're so fluent in Tassalik , and poor Lyra does n't know more than ten words of it . " " You do me more honor than I can bear , " said Patience . " I 'm only a child , and I 'm afraid to put my voice into such weighty affairs . " She was doing what her father said a loyal slave must do : warn the King when the course he had chosen seemed particularly dangerous . " You can bear the honor , " he said drily . " You and Lyra played together as children . She 'll be much more comfortable , and no doubt so will the prince , if their interpreter is a child . They 'll be , perhaps , more candid . " " I 'll do my best , " Patience said . " And I 'll remember every word , so that I can learn from my mistakes as you point them out to me afterward . " She did not know him well enough to read his calm expression . Had he really been asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if so , did he understand her promise to report afterward all that they say ? Have I pleased him or offended him , read too much into his commands , or not enough ? He waved a hand to dismiss her ; immediately she realized that she could not yet be dismissed . " My lord , " she said . He raised an eyebrow . It was presumptuous to extend one 's first meeting with the King , but if her reason was good enough , it would not harm her in his eyes . " I saw that you had the head of Lady Letheko . May I ask her some questions ? " King Oruc looked annoyed . " Your father told me that you were fully trained as a diplomat . " 11  | " Part of the training of a diplomat , " she said softly , " is to get more answers than you think you will need , so you 'll never wish , when it 's too late , that you had asked just one more question . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But not in here . I 've heard enough of her babbling for a morning . " They did n't even give her a table , so that Lady Letheko 's canister sat directly on the floor in the hallway . Out of courtesy , Patience stepped out of her skirt and sat cross-legged on the floor , so Letheko would not have to look up to see her . " Do I know you ? " asked Letheko 's head . " I 'm only a child , " said Patience . " Perhaps you did n't notice me . " " I noticed you . Your father is Peace . " Patience nodded . " So . King Oruc thinks so little of me that he lets children pump my sheep-bladder lung and make my voice ring out harshly in this shabby hallway . He might as well send me out to Common Hall on the edge of the marsh , and let beggars ask me for the protocols of the gutter . " Patience smiled shyly . She had heard Letheko in this mood before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the old lady had been teasing . It worked as well for her as it had for Father . " You are a devil of a girl , " said Letheko . " My father says so . But I have questions that only you can answer . " " Which means your father must be out of King 's Hill , or you 'd ask him . " " I 'm to be interpreter between Lyra and Prekeptor at their first meeting . " " You speak Tassalik ? Oh , of course , Peace 's daughter would know everything . " She sighed , long and theatrically , and Patience humored her by giving her plenty of air to sigh with . " I was always in love with your father , you know . Widowed twice , he was , and still never offered to take a tumble with me behind the statue of the Starship Captain in Bones Road . I was n't always like this , you know . " She giggled . " Used to have such a body . " Patience laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know ? " " The Tassaliki . They 're believers , I know , but what does that mean in practical terms ? What might offend Prekeptor ? " " Well , do n't make jokes about taking a tumble behind the statue of the Starship Captain . " " They do n't think he was the Kristos , do they ? "  | " They 're Watchers , not Rememberers . They do n't think Kristos has ever come to Imakulata , but they watch every day for him to come . " " Vigilants ? " " God protect us from Vigilants . But yes , almost . More organized , of course . They do believe in warfare , for one thing . As a sacrament . I do protocols , you know , not theology . " " Warn me of whatever I need to be warned of . " " Then stop pumping . " Patience stopped pumping air , and lay supine before the severed head in order to read its lips and catch the scraps of sound that an unbreathing mouth can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventh seventh seventh daughter will bring Kristos . " Patience was n't sure whether she had heard correctly . The phrase meant nothing to her . She let her face show her puzzlement . " No one told you ? " asked Letheko . " God help you , child . An ancient prophecy  --  some say as old as the Starship Captain  --  says that the seventh seventh seventh daughter will save the world . Or destroy it . The prophecy is vague . " Seventh seventh seventh daughter . What in the world did that mean ? " Seven times seven times seven generations since the Starship Captain . Irena was first . You are the 343rd Heptarch . " Patience covered Letheko 's lips with her fingers , to keep her even from mouthing such treason . Letheko smiled in vast amusement . " What do you think they can do to me , cut off my head ? " But Patience was no fool . She knew that heads could be tortured more cruelly and with less effort than would ever be possible with a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop this dangerous conversation with Letheko at once . And yet she had never heard of this prophecy before . It was one thing to know she was in the dangerous position of being a possible pretender to the throne . But now to know that every true believer in every human nation of the world thought of her as the fulfiller of a prophecy  --  how could Father have let her go on for so many years without telling her all of what others thought she was ? Letheko was n't through . " When you were born , a hundred thousand Tassaliki volunteered to form an army to invade Korfu and put you on the throne . They have n't forgotten . If you gave the Tassaliki so much as a hope that you would join them , they would declare a holy war and sweep into Korfu in such numbers and with such fury as we have n't  | seen since the last gebling invasion . King Oruc is insane to put you in the same room with a young Tassal prince who wants to prove his manhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her speech . Then she lifted herself on her hands , leaned forward , and kissed the wizened head on the lips . The stench of the fluids in the canister was foul , but Letheko had risked great suffering to tell her something far more important than how one behaves properly with a devout Tassal prince . A gool sloshed lazily in the canister . A tear came to the corner of the old woman 's eye . " How many times , " mouthed Letheko , " I wanted to take you in my arms and cry out , My Heptarch , Agaranthemem Heptek . " " And if you had , " whispered Patience , " I would be dead , and so would you . " Letheko grinned maniacally . " But I am . " Patience laughed , and gave Letheko air to laugh aloud . Then she called the headsman to take the old lady back to Slaves ' Hall . Patience walked through the great chambers of the court , seeing the people on their errands there in a different light . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style . How many of them were believers ? How many were Watchers , or even secret Vigilants , harboring mad thoughts of her saving  --  or destroying  --  the human race , ushering in the coming of Kristos to Imakulata ? More to the point , how many of them would die in order to bring down King Oruc and restore Peace to Heptagon House as its master , and Patience as his daughter and heir ? And as thoughts of bloody revolution swam through her head , her Father 's cool voice came to the surface and said , through a hundred memories , " Your first responsibility is the greatest good for all the world . Only when that is secure can you care for private loves and comforts and power . The King 's House is all the world . " If she was the sort of woman who would plunge Korfu and Tassali into a bloody religious war , she was too selfish and mad for power to serve as Heptarch . As many as a million could die . Perhaps more . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder Father never told her . It was a terrible temptation , one she could never have faced when she was younger . I am still young , she thought . And King Oruc is putting me alone in a room with Prekeptor and Lyra . We could talk in Tassalik and never be understood . We could plot . I could commit treason . He is testing me . He is deciding whether or not I will be loyal to him .  | No doubt he even arranged for Letheko to be available , so I could learn from her what he no doubt knew she would tell me . My life , and possibly Father 's life , is in my own hands right now . But Father would say , What is your life ? What is my life ? We keep ourselves alive only so we can serve the King 's House . And he would not say , but I would remember , The King 's House is all the world . Patience tried to figure out whether the world most needed her alive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision she was capable of making , not yet , not now . She would try to stay alive because it was unthinkable to do anything else . And to stay alive required perfect , absolute loyalty to King Oruc . She could not even appear to consider a plot to take the throne . One thing was certain . After this was over , if she pulled it off , Father 's and Angel 's simple little tests would never frighten her again . rl  | Lyra waited in the garden of Heptagon House . Obviously , her mother had dressed her . Her gown was a bizarre mixture of chastity and seduction , modest from neck to floor , with just a touch of lace at her throat and wrists . But the fabric was translucent , so that whenever she was backlit her voluptuous shape was perfectly silhouetted . " Oh , Patience , I was so glad when Father said I could have you interpret for me . I begged him for days , and he finally relented . " Could it be that her presence here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Oruc was too strong a man to let his daughters endanger his throne on a whim . " I 'm glad he did , " said Patience . " I 'll be sorry if you have to leave Heptam , but at least I can tell you whether I approve . " This was obviously a joke , spoken by a thirteen-year-old slave to the daughter of the Heptarch , but Lyra was so tense she did n't notice the impropriety of the remark . " I hope you do . And oh , if you see something in him that I do n't see , please let me know . I want so very much to please Father by marrying this prince , but if he 's really awful , I ca n't possibly go through with it . " Patience showed nothing of the contempt she felt . Imagine  --  a daugh- ter of the Starship Captain 's blood even thinking of refusing a marriage , not for reasons of state , but because she found the suitor unattractive . To put one 's personal pleasure ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfitness . You should be out in a country house , said Patience silently , the daughter of a country lord , going to country dances and giggling with your girlfriends about which of the country boys had the fewest pimples and the least repulsive breath . Neither her words nor her face betrayed her true feelings . Instead she made herself a perfect mirror , reflecting back to Lyra exactly what Lyra wanted to see and hear . " He wo n't be awful , Lyra . The negotiators would never have come this far if he had a second head growing out of his shoulder . " " Nobody gets second heads anymore , " said Lyra . " They have a vaccine for it . " Poor child , thought Patience . She was usually bright enough to understand such an obvious irony as that . It did not seem incongruous to Patience that she was thinking of Lyra , three years her senior , as a child . Lyra had been pampered and spoiled , and despite the evidence of her body she was not a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in King 's Hill , Patience had wished for just one night a year in the soft bed of one of the Heptarch 's daughters . But now , seeing the poor result of a gentle upbringing , she silently thanked her father for the cold room , the hard bed , the plain food , the endless study and exercise . " You 're right , of course , " said Patience . " May I kiss you for luck ? " Lyra distractedly held out her hand . Patience knelt before her and reverently kissed Lyra 's fingertips . She had learned years ago what a soothing effect such obeisance had on Oruc 's daughters . As Angel always said , Your own humility is the best flattery . The far door to the garden opened . A white hawk flew out the door into the open air . It immediately flew straight up and began to circle . A white songbird , already perched on a low branch , began to sing sweetly . Lyra cried out softly , hiding her mouth behind her hand , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward directly toward the songbird And was caught by the swift motion of a net . It struggled , but the young falconer who had caught the hawk reached deftly past the jabbing beak and brought the bird upside-down out of the net . The falconer was dressed all in white , a perfect , dazzling white that hurt the eyes when the sun was reflected in it . He whistled ; the door opened  | behind him and two servants came out , bearing cages . In only a few seconds , the falconer had put the two birds into the cages . Through it all , the songbird had not missed a note . Obviously , thought Patience , this scene has been rehearsed so often the songbird has lost its fear of the hawk . Then she looked more closely and realized that , quite to the contrary , the songbird remained perfectly placid because it was blind . The eyes had been put out . The servants stepped back toward the door as the falconer sank to his fees in front of Lyra and began to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he whispered . " So will I protect you always from the despoiler , " said Patience . Her inflection was , as far as possible , a perfect mirror of Prekeptor 's . " It was beautiful , " said Lyra .

" " Oh , you sound just like me , " whispered Lyra . Prekeptor spoke again , and Patience translated . " I have brought a gift for the Heptarch 's daughter . " Be reached out his hand . A servant placed a book in it . " A copy of the Testament of Irena , the Starship Captain 's Daughter , " he said . Ile held the book out toward Patience . Patience was annoyed , since it was more proper for the suitor to ignore the interpreter and place the book directly in the hand of his intended . But perhaps in Tassali a servant was used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs . Lyra pretended to be thrilled when Patience gave her the book . Quietly Patience pointed out to her that the pages of the book were unfinished paperleaf , which had grown in such perfectly uniform shape and size that no trimming was needed to make a perfect book . " It took great effort in breeding the paperleaf , " said Patience . She did not point out that it was about as stupid a waste of time as she could imagine , since processed paperleaf was much better for writing and lasted longer , too . " Oh , " said Lyra . And she managed to come up with a gracious little speech of thanks . " Do n't think that I pride myself on my technique with plant husbandry , " protested the Prince . " It has often been said that the plants and animals of Imakulata seem to understand what traits we are trying to develop , and they change themselves to cooperate . Even so I shall gladly be and do exactly what the Heptarch 's daughter desires of me . " Patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her instead of at Lyra when he spoke . The interpreter is furniture ; every diplomat was taught that . Except , obviously , Tassal princes . Prekeptor came up with another gift . It was a small glass rod , hollow and filled with flowing light . Even in broad daylight it glowed ; when he shaded it under his hand , it was positively bright . Again he smiled modestly and made a little speech about his own poor skill at husbandry . " If there were any Wise left in the world , I might have done this far more quickly , by altering the genetic molecule , but as it is I turned the great shipeater weed into something quite useful . " He smiled . " You can read the Testament in bed after your father has commanded you to blow out the candles . " " I never read in bed , " said Lyra , puzzled . " It was a joke , " said Patience . " At least smile . " Lyra laughed . Too loudly , but she was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His white clothing showed his body to be lithe and strong ; his face could have been the model for a statue of Courage or Manhood or Virtue . When he smiled , he seemed to be making love with his eyes . And Lyra did n't miss any of it . Except that Prekeptor never took his eyes off Patience . And now she realized what a dangerous game the Prince was playing . " The Heptarch 's daughter will find that the prophecies of joy in the Testament will all be fulfilled in her life , " said Prekeptor . Patience dutifully translated , but also realized now that the Prince was saying every word to her , the true Heptarch 's daughter , with the meaning doubled . The prophecies in the Testament no doubt included some of the mumbo jumbo about the seventh seventh seventh daughter . He was urging Patience to accept the prophecies . The Prince had still a third gift . It was a plastic sheath that fitted over the glass rod . Within the sheath were constantly shifting flows of brightcolored but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fascinating and beautiful . Prekeptor handed it to Patience . " The Heptarch 's daughter will see that it can be worn , if she chooses , like a crown , for all the world to see and admire , " said the Prince . " It 's like the future  --  you can choose any color and follow it wherever it goes . If the Heptarch 's daughter chooses wisely , she 'll take a path that leads to the restoration of all that was lost . " Subtly , in mid-speech , he had ceased using double meanings . Now he was clearly speaking only to Patience , and offering her a restoration to the throne . Patience could not possibly translate Prekeptor 's last sentence . Lyra  | would insist on an explanation . However , Patience could not leave it out of her translation , either , or change its meaning , because that would alert Oruc 's listeners that she was conspiring with the Prince to conceal his treasonous offer . So instead she stood silent . " What did he say ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Patience . To Prekeptor she said , " I 'm sorry my understanding of Tassalik is so poor , but I can not understand anything that is said on this subject . I beg the Prince to converse on matters that this poor interpreter can comprehend . " " I understand , " he answered , smiling . His hands were trembling . " I , too , feel fear , here in the heart of Heptagon House . What you do not know is that all of our party are trained soldiers and assassins . They are prepared to penetrate to the deepest recesses of Heptagon House to destroy your enemies . " Anything Patience answered could be her death sentence . In the first place , she herself had been trained as an assassin , and she knew that if Prekeptor 's plan had any chance of working , he had just destroyed it by saying it out loud in the open garden . No doubt throughout Heptagon House all the Tassal embassy was now being placed under irresistible arrest , with the words of their own prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be listened to here in the garden told Patience that Prekeptor was too great a fool for her to entrust her life to him . But there was nothing she could say to stop him and clear herself . If she said , I have no enemies here in Heptagon House , she was admitting that he was somehow correct to call her the Heptarch 's daughter . She had to go on pretending that she had no idea of why he was speaking to her , and to do that she had to pretend not to understand the plainestspoken Tassalik . It was n't likely anyone would believe it , but it was not necessary to be believed . It was necessary merely to make it possible for Oruc to pretend to believe it . As long as they could both pretend that she did n't know she was the rightful Heptarch 's daughter , she could be allowed to live . So she put on her most baffled expression and said , " I 'm sorry , I guess I 'm out of my depth . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do n't . " " What is he saying ? " asked Lyra . She sounded concerned . As well she might be , since Prekeptor , far from coming to marry her , had come to kill her father and , no doubt , her as well . " I 'm sorry , " said Patience . " I understood almost nothing . "  | " I thought you were fluent . " " So did I. " " Mother of Kristos , " whispered Prekeptor . " Mother of God , why do n't you see the hand of God in my coming ? I am the angel that stands at the door and knocks . I announce to you : God will fill your womb . " His words were frightening enough , but the fervency with which he said them was terrifying . What role did he have in mind for her in his religion ? Mother of God  --  that was the ancient virgin from Earth , and yet he called her that as if it were her name . Still , she showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely puzzled look on her face . " Holy Mother , do n't you see how Kristos has prepared the path for his coming ? " He took a step toward her . Immediately she hardened her expression , and he stopped , retreated two steps . " No matter what you think , God is irresistible , " he said . " He has devoted seven times seven times seven generations to create you to be the fit mother of the incarnation of Kristos on the planet Imakulata . This is greater than the number of generations down to the time of the Virgin of Earth . " She let the helpless , puzzled look return to her face , even as she tried to plan a course of action . In a way , this was just like one of Angel 's favorite games . He would give her a complex mathematical problem ? orally , so she had no written guide to help her concentrate  --  and then immediately launch into a complex story . Five minutes or ten minutes or half an hour later , the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mathematical problem . When she had answered it , he would ask her to tell him the entire story . In detail . Over the years she had become adept at concentrating on two things at once . Of course , her life had never before depended on the outcome of the game . " They have not taught you , I see . They have kept you ignorant of your true identity . Do n't pretend not to understand my language , for I know you do . I will tell you . God created Imakulata as his most godly planet . Here in this world , the powers of creation run fast and deep . On Earth it took thousands of generations for evolutionary change to take place . Here , in only three or four generations we can breed major changes into any species . Those trifles I brought as gifts  --  they are new species , and it took only four generations to perfect them . It is as if the genetic molecule understood what we wanted it to become , and changed itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is for the native species . It is only here on Imakulata , God 's World of Creation , that every creature 's genetic molecule , which is the mirror of the will , obeys the slightest command to change . Does giving off more light  | increase the plant 's chance of reproducing ? Then immediately every plant gives off far more light  --  even plants that did not take part in the experiment , plants as much as a half-mile away . Do you see what this means ? God had given us here on Imakulata a taste of his power . " Patience toyed with and then rejected the idea of killing the Prince . If he had been an ordinary subject of the Heptarch , it would have been her duty to kill him for what he had said already , if only because he represented a clear danger to Lyra . But it was not the prerogative of an interpreter to kill the heir to the throne of Tassali . King Oruc might regard it as an unfortunate intrusion into his foreign policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity . Alone of the life forms of Imakulata , human beings remain unchanged . For God is performing the creation of man . And the crowning achievement is you  --  for God will cause you to give birth to Kristos , the only perfect man , who is the mirror of God , just as the genetic molecule is the mirror of the will , the cerebrum is the mirror of the identity , and the limbic node is the mirror of the passion . The Wise thought they could meddle with the genetic molecule directly , that they could alter the plans of God by making your father incapable of bearing daughters so the prophecy could not be fulfilled . But God destroyed the Wise , and your father did bear a daughter , and you shall bear the Son of God no matter what you or anyone may do to try to prevent it . " Patience could not leave , either . She needed to show a decisive rejection of what he had said , not just a desire to run from it . Besides , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness of his faith was on him ; he trembled , and there was such fire in him that it was beginning to kindle a response in her . She dared not listen to more , for fear she might begin to doubt her own skepticism ; she dared not leave ; she dared not kill him to silence him . Therefore she had only one choice . She reached into her hair and carefully drew out the loop . " What are you doing ? " asked Lyra , who had been taught , as a child of the heptarch , to recognize all the known weapons of assassination . Patience did not answer Lyra . She spoke instead to Prekeptor . " Prince Prekeptor , I believe I understand enough to realize that you believe my very existence is somehow a reason to bring down my noble Heptarch , King Oruc . Now that I see what a danger my very life causes to my King , I have no alternative , as a true servant of the King 's House , but to end my life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own throat , drew it tight , and gave a tiny jerk that caused the loop to cut into the skin to a depth of about two millimeters all the way around her neck . The pain  | was surprisingly slight at first . The cut was not uniform  --  in some places it cut quite deep . But it had the effect she intended . Immediately blood streamed thick as a bright red collar around her neck . The look of horror on Prekeptor 's face was almost fun to watch . " My God ! " he cried , " My God , what have I done ! " Nothing , you fool , thought Patience . I 've done it . And silenced you , too . Then the real pain came , and dizziness from the sudden loss of blood . I hope I did n't cut too deeply , thought Patience . I do n't want to leave a scar . Lyra screamed . Patience felt her legs giving way under her . Ah , yes . I must collapse as if I were dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . She clutched at her own throat  --  carefully removing the loop in the process  --  and was surprised at the great amount of blood that was still flowing . Wo n't I feel foolish if I cut myself too deeply and bleed to death right here in the garden . Prekeptor was weeping . " Holy Mother , I meant no harm to you . God help her , 0 Lord of Heaven , who sent away the Wise in their blasphemy , forgive now this Fool who gave himself to your service , and heal the Mother of Thy Son ? " The sides of the world closed up ; she could only see in a tunnel straight ahead of her . She saw hands come and take Prekeptor and carry him away from her . She heard Lyra 's screaming and weeping . She felt gentle hands take her and lift her up , and someone whispering , " No one has ever been so loyal to a heptarch as to take her own life rather than hear treason . " Is that what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And then , as they carried her out of the garden , she thought : I wonder if Angel will approve of my solution to the problem . As for the story , I remember every word of it . Every word .  | Patience was already weary of lying in bed after the first day . Visits from people with nothing intelligent to say made her even wearier . " I do n't think there 'll be a scar , " said Lyra . " I would n't mind if there were , " said Patience . " It was the bravest thing I ever saw . " " Not really , " said Patience . " I knew I would n't die . It was the only way to silence him . " " But what was he saying ? " Patience shook her head . " He was n't the ideal husband for you , believe me . " Lyra looked profoundly worried . Well she should be , thought Patience . Maybe Lyra is realizing for the first time that her dynastic rights might be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Was he trying to  --  to arrange to  --  you know . With you . " Oh . Of course Lyra would n't have dynastic worries . She had never been taught responsibility . " I ca n't talk about it , " said Patience . She turned her face away , though , so Lyra would convince herself that the answer was yes . " Right in front of me , wanting to  --  but why you ? I know you 're  | pretty , everyone says so , but I 'm the Heptarch 's daughter  --  and I 'm not ugly , either . I 'm really not . I 'm very objective about that . " " The only men who would n't be glad to have you as their wife are the victims of terrible pelvic accidents , " said Patience , smiling . After a moment , Lyra understood and blushed . " You must n't talk that way . " But she was flattered . And now that Patience had succeeded in convincing her that she did n't owe some debt of guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't come here yesterday as ignorant of the truth as Lyra still is . Someday , though , someone will tell her who I am , and why my father 's ancient claim is seen by some as a bit more valid than Oruc 's . Then she 'll understand what was really going on today , and perhaps realize that it was my survival I was working for , not my death . What worried her was not Lyra 's reaction . It was King Oruc 's . He was the only audience that Patience 's performance was designed to please . If he saw her gesture as a desperate effort to prove her loyalty , t hen she would survive . But if he actually believed she was trying to kill herself , he would believe her insane and never trust her with anything . tier career would be over before it began . The doctor had her wound clamped shut with the jaws of hundreds of tiny earwigs . " Not like regular earwigs , though , " the doctor said . " These were bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze their abdomens in a certain way . They respond to the flexing of your skin and promote the healing process . Without excessive scar tissue . " " Very clever , " murmured Patience . Everyone assumed she did n't want a scar . But she was n't sure . It would n't hurt to have a visible reminder , every time people saw her , of how loyal she was to King ( ) ruc . She was tempted to squeeze off the earwigs herself , or readjust their position so the scar would dimple and twist . But no , it would be too obvious if she deliberately left a scar herself . It would diminish some of the power of her act . For it was a powerful act . Oruc gave her a room of honor in Heptagon House during her convalescence , and many adults stopped to wish her well . Few of them were skilled at the diplomatic arts , and so she could easily see that most of them were at once drawn to and repelled by who she was . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bloom of womanhood on her , of an age that often caused wistfulness in adults who ache for their youth and beauty , even though they know perfectly well that they were never really as young and beautiful as she . She was also the true Heptarch 's daughter , the legendary seventh sev- enth seventh daughter of the Starship Captain . Until now , they could never openly seek her out , for fear of arousing King Oruc 's suspicions . But who could criticize them for paying their respects to a young girl who had performed heroic service for the King 's daughter ? So she received them as they visited in ones and twos , to say a few words , touch her hand . Many of them tried to touch her with gestures of respect that properly belonged only to the Heptarch 's family ; she rejected those gestures by subtly replacing them with her own . Always she explicitly honored her visitor as being someone far superior to her in rank . Some saw this as a clever disguise ; others as true humility ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Angel did not come to visit her , and that Father did not seem to be hurrying home . It was unthinkable that they would not come to her if they could . Therefore someone must be forbidding them to come . And the only one who could do that was King Oruc . Something in her performance had bothered him . He still was n't sure of her . At last the stream of visitors stopped . The doctor came with two orderlies . Gently they lifted her into a litter . They did not have to tell her where she was going . When Oruc summons , there is no need for discussion in Heptagon House . One simply goes . They set down the litter in Oruc 's chamber . His Consort was n't there , but three unfamiliar heads were . She did not recognize them . And she had spent enough time in Slaves ' Hall to know all the faces there . So either these were not former ministers of state , or they were so important to King Oruc that he kept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could talk to them . Each head 's canister rested on its own table , with a dwelf seated behind it to pump the air bladder . " So that 's the girl , " one of them murmured when she came in . Because the dwelfs were n't pumping right then , he did not make a sound , but she saw his lips move . And though she was n't sure , another might have mouthed her true name , " Agaranthemem Heptek . " The doctor fussed and preened , showing off his excellent skill at healing her wound . Without , of course , a scar . " Very good , Doctor , " said Oruc . " But then , I expect my technicians to perform their tasks well . " The doctor was miffed at being called a mere technician , but of course he tried to conceal his annoyance . " Thank you , Lord Heptarch . " " No scar , " said Oruc . He peered at her neck critically . " None at all . "  | " But a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hard choice , between a scar and a necklace of earwigs . " " Oh , no , " said the doctor . " The earwigs will come off very soon . Now , if they displease you , sir . " Oruc looked weary . " What you heard , Doctor , was not my stupidity , but my sense of humor . " " Oh , of course , I 'm such a fool , forgive me , I 'm a bit tense , I ? " and then , realizing his talking was making things worse , the doctor burst into artificial laughter . " Enough . Fine work . I commend you . Go away . " The doctor scurried out the door . Oruc exhaled wearily . " Surely there has been a decline in the quality of court life since the Flight of the Wise . " " I would n't know , sir , " said Patience . " I was n't born then . I 've never known any of the Wise . " Oruc raised an eyebrow . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " No , it 's not true to say that . I 've known some Wise among the dead . " He did not need to glance back at the three heads behind him . " And one wise man among the living , one man among all my ministers who gives me counsel worth hearing , who cares as much for Korfu as I do . " " My father , " she whispered . " A most unlucky situation , is n't it ? " said Oruc . " Even the wisest King needs good advice , and there 's little of that left in the world . I would give half my kingdom to know what became of the Wise when they left here , and how to bring them back . " One of the heads behind him spoke up . Apparently the dwelfs were pumping again . " Oruc , you 're likely to lose half your kingdom because you do n't know . " Another head gave a crazed old man 's giggle . " So it 's a bargain for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bargain . " " You know where the Wise went , " said the third , a grim face with no teeth . " Cranning . And there 's no bringing them back from there . " " It 's the dilemma of our times , " said Oruc to Patience . " We 're long overdue for another gebling invasion . Twelve times in seven thousand years they have poured out of their vast city Cranning , out of the caverns of Skyfoot , and each time all of human civilization has been broken under their onslaught . Then they go back to their caverns or back to being somewhat pitiful merchants and voyagers and wanderers through the world , while human beings struggle back , rediscover what science they can . Only one human institution has outlasted it all , a in  | single bloodline of power from the first moment mankind set foot on Imakulata until it was time for the thirteenth gebling invasion . " He did not say it , but of course she knew he was referring to the Heptarchy . To her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of an invasion , all the Wise , all the men and women of learning  --  no , not of mere learning , but of true understanding  --  all of them , one by one , felt the Cranning call . An unbearable , undeniable , irresistible urge to go somewhere . They were never sure where , they said . But they were followed , and they all went to Cranning . All of them . Statesmen , generals , scientists , teachers , builders  --  all the men and women that a King must rely on to carry out his rule , they all left . Who could stand then , when the Wise were gone ? " " No one , " whispered Patience . She was truly afraid now , for he was speaking so frankly of the fall of her family 's ancient dynasty that she could not help but assume he intended to kill her after this conversation was over . " No one . The Cranning call took them , and the Heptarch fell . He was n't much of a Heptarch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Patience . " A beastly fellow : Even discounting the propaganda my father put out , he was unspeakable . He used to preserve the heads of his former lovers and put their canisters around his bed , to watch him make love to his latest creature . " " I should think , " said Patience , " that was more of a torture to the current lover than to the former ones . " Oruc laughed . " Yes . Though you 're only a child , so you should n't know about such things . There are so many things you should n't know about . My personal physician  --  who is not Wise , I suspect  --  examined you before the earwig man sewed you up . He tells me you could not possibly have done a more perfect job of cutting yourself to draw the most possible blood without causing any permanent or even dangerous damage . " " I was fortunate , " said Patience . " Your father did n't tell me he was training you in the arts of murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has often told me of your maxim , that one well-placed assassination can save untold numbers of lives . " Oruc smiled and spoke to the heads . " She flatters me by quoting my own words back to me , and telling me that the great Lord Peace repeats them often . "  | " Actually , " said the dourest head , " I said those words to you first . " " You 're dead , Konstans . I do n't have to give you credit . " Konstans . Eight hundred years ago there had been a Konstans who restored Korfu to hegemony over the entire length of the Glad River , yy only ten years after a gebling invasion , and without a drop of blood being shed . If it was the same man , it would explain the decrepit condition of the head . Few heads ever lasted as long as a thousand years ? this one was nearing the end of its function . " I still have my vanity , " said Kot stans 's head . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill . And so deftly that she can create death 's illusion on herself . " " She is her father 's daughter , " said another head . " That 's what I 'm afraid of , " said Oruc . " How old are you ? Thirteen . How can you kill besides the loop ? " " Many ways , " said Patience . " Father says I'm-not strong enough to pull the bow properly , and casting a javelin is n't much use in our trade . But poisons , darts , daggers  --  I grew up with them . " " And bombs ? Incendiaries ? " " The duty of a diplomat is to kill as quietly and discreetly as possible . " " Your father says . " " Yes . " " Could you kill me now ? Here , in this room , could you kill me ? " Patience did not answer . " I command you to answer me . " She knew too much of protocol to be drawn into the trap . " Sir , please do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak about whether I could kill the King . Whether I obey or not , I commit terrible treason . " " I want honest answers . Why do you think I keep these heads around me ? They ca n't lie  --  that 's what the headworms do to them , they make sure that they can never answer dishonestly , or even withhold part of the truth . " " The heads , sir , are already dead . If you wish me to behave as they do , it is within your power . " " I want truth from you , and never mind protocol . " " As long as I am alive , I will never speak treason . " Oruc leaned close to her , his face angry and dangerous . " I am not interested in your determination to survive at all costs , girl . I want you to speak honestly to me. "  | Konstans chuckled . " Child , he ca n't kill you . You 're safe to speak to him , for now , at least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeterred . " You see , he depends on your father , and he believes your father will never serve him faithfully unless you 're held hostage here . Alive . So what he 's trying to determine now is whether you can also be useful to him , or whether you will remain nothing more than a constant temptation to his enemies . " Konstans 's analysis made sense , and Oruc did n't argue with him . It seemed absurd to her , to have the most powerful human being in the world treating her like a potentially dangerous adult . But her respect for Oruc was rising in the process . Many a lesser ruler would have destroyed her and Father , fearing the danger of them more than any possible value they might have . So she made the decision to trust him . It frightened her , because that was the one thing Father and Angel had never taught her : when to trust . " My Lord Heptarch , " said Patience , " if the thought of killing you could live for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Now ? " There was an expression of veiled triumph in his eyes . Had he won a victory , then , by convincing her to trust him ? I have begun ; I will not retreat . " Even now , even if I told you I was going to do it , I could kill you before you raised a hand to defend yourself . My father knows his trade , and I have studied with the master . " Oruc turned to one of the dwelfs . " Go fetch my guards and tell them to come arrest this girl for treason . " He turned to Patience and calmly said , " Thank you . I needed a legal basis for your execution . These heads will be witnesses that you claimed in my presence to be able to kill me . " It shook her , how calmly he betrayed her . And yet she could not wholly believe the betrayal . No , this was just another test , another move in the game . He really did need Peace  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major action without consulting Peace first  --  and so he really did fear to kill Patience . Nothing had changed that . And if it was a test , she would win . She nodded gravely . " If I can best serve my Heptarch by dying through legal process , I 'll confess to that or any other crime . " Oruc walked to her , touched her hair , stroked her cheek with the back of his fingers . " Beautiful . The Mother of God . " She endured it placidly . He was n't going to kill her . That was victory enough for the moment . " I wonder if someone is breeding humans , as the Tassaliki claim . Not  | God  --  I doubt he bothers much with the mating of humans on Imakulata  --  but someone . Someone with the power to call the Wise . " He took her chin , not gently , and tipped her face upward . " If someone wanted to breed magnificence , I could believe you as the result of his work . Not right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a translucence to you , a lightness in your eyes . " Until this moment , it had never occurred to Patience that she might be beautiful . Her mirror did not reveal the soft and rounded features that were the fashion of beauty these days . But there was no hint of flattery or deception in Oruc 's words . " As long as you 're alive , " he whispered , " anyone who sees you will want me dead , so you can take my place . Do you understand that ? Me and all my family , dead . Whether or not someone bred you to be what you are , you are . And I will not have my children destroyed for your sake . Do you understand me ? " " Your children have been my playmates all my life , " said Patience . " I should kill you . Your father even advised me to kill you . But I wo n't do it . " But Patience knew that there was an unspoken word : yet . I will not kill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to leave you alive , for in truth I rejoice in you as surely as any Vigilant . What maddens me is that I do n't remember deciding to leave you alive . I do n't remember choosing . The decision was simply  --  made . Is it you ? Is it some trick of manipulation your father taught you ? " Patience did n't answer . He did n't seem to expect her to . " Or am I being twisted as the Wise were twisted ? The decision made for me because whoever it is wants you , wants you alive . " He turned to the heads . " You  --  you have no will anymore , only memory and passion . I ) o you remember what it is to choose ? " " A dim memory , " said Konstans . " I think I did it once or twice . " Oruc turned his back on them . " I have done it all my life . Chosen . Consciously , deliberately chosen , and then acted upon my choice , regardless of passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triune soul  --  the priests know it , that 's why they fear me , why there is no revolution in your name . They believe that whenever I choose to , I can and certainly will kill you . They do n't know . That on this matter I have no will . " Patience believed that he believed what he was saying . But it was still not true . There would come a time when he feared her more than now , and he would kill her . She could feel that certainty lying beneath every- thing he said . For that was the foundation of his power , that he could kill anyone when he chose to . " Father told me once , " she said . " There are two ways to rule human beings . One is to convince the people that if they do not obey , they and those they love will be destroyed . The other is to earn the love of the people . And he told me where these two ways lead . Eventually , the course of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flattery leads to contempt and anarchy . " " So he believes no power can last ? " " No . Because there is a third way . It looks like the course of love sometimes , and sometimes it looks like the course of terror . " " Back and forth between the two ? The people would n't know you then , and none would follow you . " " No . It is n't back and forth between anything . It 's a straight and steady course . The course of magnanimity . Greatness of heart . " " It means nothing to me . One of the cardinal virtues , but the priests do n't even know what it means . " " To love your people so much that you would sacrifice anything for the good of the whole . Your own life , your own family , your own happiness . And then you expect the same from them . " Oruc looked at her coldly . " You 're repeating what you learned by rote . " " Yes , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heptarch , and see if it is true . " " Magnanimity . Sacrifice anything . What do you think I am  --  Kris-tos ? " " I think you are my Heptarch , and you will always have my loyalty . " " But will my children ? " asked Oruc . " Can you tell me that ? " She bowed her head . " My lord , for your sake I would die for your children . " " I know . We 've had theatrical proof of that . But I know better than you do . You are loyal to me because your father taught you to be , and he is loyal to me because he loves Korfu as much as I do . He 's a wise man , your father . The last of the Wise , I believe . I think it 's only because of his bloodline that he has n't heard the Cranning call . When he is dead  --  that old man , I can see death in him now already  --  when he is dead , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent for were waiting in the doorways . He beckoned them in . " Take her back to the physician and have those bugs removed . Then give her back into the custody of her father 's slave . Angel . He 's waiting in the garden . " He turned to patience . " He 's waited there for days , never stirring . A most devoted servant . By the  | way , I 've ordered a medal struck in your honor . Every member of the Fourteen Families will wear it for this week , as will the Mayor and Council of Heptam . You handled the situation with the Tassali brilliantly . Perfectly . I will have occasion to use your talents again . " He %nailed gruesomely . " All your talents . " This had been her final examination , then , and she had passed . He intended to use her as a diplomat , young as she was . And as an assassin . She would wait now , as her father had always waited , for the knock on the door in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from King Oruc . She would read the note , as Father did , to learn who it was who should die . Then she would burn it and comb the ashes into fine powder . Then she would kill . She almost danced down the corridors of Heptagon House . She needed no litter now . She had faced the King , and he had chosen her as her father had been chosen . Angel took up her education where it had left off only a few days before , as if nothing had happened . She knew enough not to speak of these matters inside King 's Hill , where everything was overheard and reported . Two days later , Angel received a message late in the afternoon and immediately closed his book . " Patience , " he said . " We will go down in to the city this afternoon . " " Father is home ! " she cried in delight . Angel smiled at her as he put her cloak around her shoulders . " Perhaps we could go to the School . We might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School was a large open place in the middle of Ileptam . Years ago , the Wise of the world had come here to teach to all corners . Because of Crossriver Delving and Lost Souls ' Island , Heptam was known as the religious capital of the world ; the School made it the intellectual center as well . But now , a generation after the Flight of the Wise , the School was no more than a gaggle of scholars who endlessly recited dead and memorized words that they did not understand . Angel took great delight in teaching Patience to go to the heart of an argument and find its weak place . Then she would confront the would-be philosopher and skewer him publicly . She did n't do it often , but enjoyed knowing that she could , whenever she liked . Learn something ? Not at the School . It was n't learning she was after anyway . It was freedom . Whenever Father was away , she was forced to remain within the high walls of King 's Hill , among the same nobles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of King 's Hill , and it held no surprises ii  | for her . But whenever Father came home , she was free . As long as he was behind the walls of King 's Hill , Angel could take her wherever he wanted in the city . They used these times to practice techniques they could never use in King 's Hill . Disguises , for instance . They would often dress and talk as servants , as criminals , as merchants , pretending to be father and daughter . Or , sometimes , mother and son , for as Angel said , " The most perfect disguise is to change from one sex to another , for when they are searching for a girl , all boys are invisible to them . " Even better than the disguises , though , was the talk . Switching from language to language , they could freely converse as they walked along the bustling streets . No one could stay near them long enough to overhear an entire conversation . It was the only time when she could ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions . It would have been completely joyful , this trip down the hill to Heptam , except for one constant sadness : Father never came with her on these trips . Oruc never let them leave King 's Hill together . So all her life , all her conversations with her father had been guarded , careful . All her life , she had had to guess what Father really meant , discern his true purpose , for as often as not he could never say in words what he wanted her to know . Their secrets could only be passed back and forth by Angel . He would take her out into the city , and she would talk with him ; then he would leave her in King 's Hill and walk in the city with Peace . Angel was a good friend , and both of them could trust him implicitly . But in spite of Angel 's best efforts , it was like conversing through an interpreter all the time . Never in her life had Patience known a single moment of true intimacy with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Town , descending long sloping roads toward the School , Patience asked Angel why the King forced them to be separate this way . " Does n't he know yet that we are his most loyal subjects ? " " He knows you are , Lady Patience , but he misunderstands why . In treating you and your father this way , he says nothing about you , but much about himself . He believes that by keeping one of you hostage at all times , he can guarantee the loyalty of the other . There are many people who can be controlled that way . They 're the people who love their families above anything else . They call it a virtue , but it is nothing more than protecting one 's own genes . Reproductive self-interest . That is the thing that Oruc lives by . He is a great King , but his family comes  | first , so that in the final crisis , he could be held hostage , too . " It was treason to say such a thing , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the argot of the Islanders , so there was little chance of a passerby understanding any of it . " Am I Father 's hostage , then ? " Patience asked . Angel looked grim . " Oruc thinks you are , Lady Patience , and any assurance Lord Peace gives him that he would be loyal even if you were free seems further proof to the Heptarch that your father is desperate to win your freedom . And mark me well , little girl . Oruc thinks you are obedient in order to protect your father 's life , as well . " " How sad , if he believes that everyone who says they love and serve him willingly is a liar . " " Kings have found they live longer when they assume the worst about their subjects . They do n't live more happily , but they tend to die of old age rather than the abrupt disease called treachery . " " But Angel , Father will not live forever . Who will he think is my hostage , then ? " Angel said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good chance she would not outlive her father by many years . Patience was the daughter of his second wife , whom he had married late ; he was near seventy now , and not in the best of health . " But Angel , all the reasons the Heptarch has now for not killing me will still be in force then . If all the religious fanatics think I 'm to be the Mother of Kristos ? " " Not just the fanatics , Lady Patience . " " What will it do to the legitimacy of his rule if he kills me ? " " What will it do to the legitimacy of his children 's rule if he does not ? He can keep you under control , but when he dies , you 'll be young , at the peak of your powers . And now he knows that you are a dangerous assassin , a clever diplomat , with a powerful will to survive . It will be dangerous to Korfu , perhaps to the whole world , if he kills you ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look for an assassin in the days following your father 's death . If all goes well , your father will know he is dying soon enough to send me away . You are expected to know how to deal with any assassins and get out of King 's Hill . At sunset on the day of your father 's death , meet me here , at the School . I will have a way to get you out of the city . " They walked among clusters of students . The nonsense being spouted by the sophists on every side seemed a bitter contrast to the thought of her future after her father died . " And where will I go ? " asked Patience .  | " I 'm trained for the King 's service . If he 's trying to kill me , I can hardly do that . " " Do n't be such a fool , Lady Patience . Never for an instant were you trained for the King 's service . " In that moment , Patience 's understanding of her whole life up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her sense of who she was , what she was meant to become , changed . I am not meant to advise and serve a King . I am meant to be the King . They do not mean me to be Lady Patience . They mean me to be Agaranthemem Heptek . She stopped . People walking behind them pushed past . " All my life , " she said , " I have learned to be loyal to the King . " " And so you should be , and so you shall be , " said Angel . " Walk , or the spies who frequent this place will overhear us , and we 're speaking treason . You are loyal to King Oruc for the very good reason that for the good of Korfu and all human nations at this time , he should remain as Heptarch . But the time will come when his weakness will be fatal , and then for the good of Korfu and all human nations , you will need to assume the throne and bear the scepter of the Heptarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be ready . " " So when Father dies , I go to Tassali and raise an army ? Invade my own land and people ? " " You 'll do what is necessary for the good of the whole people at that time . And by that time you will know what that good must be . It has nothing to do with what is good for you or your kin . You know that your duty comes before any private emotion or loyalty . That is why King Oruc does not really hold you or your father hostage . If the good of the King 's House required either of you to take an action that would certainly result in the death of the other , you would not hesitate . That is true magnanimity , to love the whole , and therefore to love no part greater than the whole . A daughter no more than a stranger , where the good of the King 's House is concerned . " It was true . Father would let her die , if the good of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . when she was only eight years old . On the day of her formal baptism , he took her out King 's Creek to the Binding House on Lost Souls ' Island  --  the King 's private and loyal monastery , not that nest of sedition at Heads House in Crossriver Delving , where the priests prayed openly for Oruc 's death . As Angel rowed the boat , he told her that Father would certainly let her die and make no effort to save her , if it was for the good of the King 's House . It was a cruel thing , and she felt it like a knife through her heart . By the time her baptism was over , however , and they were again  | on the water returning to King 's Hill , she made her decision . She , too , would have greatness of heart . She , too , would learn to love the King 's House more than her own father . For that was the way of it . If she was to become like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man . Or , perhaps , merely keep it in abeyance , to be discarded easily if it were ever necessary for the good of the King 's House . Despite that decision , though , she still longed , just once , to have the opportunity to speak freely and fearlessly with Peace . Even now , walking through the School with Angel , speaking to him about her greatest fears for the future , she was keenly aware that he was not her father . She did not want to discuss anymore what would happen when Father died . So she rattled on for an hour about everything that had happened in the garden of Heptagon House , and later , in the King 's chambers . She explained how she had unraveled the puzzles . She even repeated almost verbatim the strange doctrines that Prekeptor had set forth about her destiny . " Well , as far as it goes , " said Angel , " he tells a reasonably true story . The Wise were playing with genetics in a way never before possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign tissues and mirrored the genetic molecule in slowly shifting crystals on the surface . It enabled the scientists to study the genetic code in great detail , without any magnification at all . And by altering the crystals in the gel , the tissue samples could also be altered . Then they could be implanted in the host 's reproductive cells . It was a similar technique that kept your father from having a daughter for so many years . And a similar technique that changed him back , so you could be born . " Patience answered scornfully . " So God did n't like them meddling with the mirror of the will , and took them away ? " " The mirror of the will , the triune soul  --  you should n't scoff at it , even if you have decided to be a Skeptic . This religion has lasted pretty well over the years , and partly because some of the ideas work . You can live with the triune soul as a model for the way the mind works . The will , contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most primitive part of ourselves , the thing that we ca n't understand , why we finally choose what we choose  --  why not put it in the genes ? And then the passions  --  the desire for greatness on the one side , and all the destructive desires on the other . Why not put them in the limbic node , the animal part of the brain ? And the identity , the sense of self , that is our memories , the cerebrum , all that we remember doing and seeing , and what we conceive it to mean . There 's a certain power in conceiving your own self in that way , Patience . It allows you to separate yourself from  | your memories and your passions , to impose discipline on your life . We are never deceived into believing that either our environment or our desires cause our behavior . " " More to the point , Angel . What happened to Prekeptor , with or without his religion ? " " He was sent home . Though I must tell you that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was already trembling with it . " " No , that was the love of God . Fear was your contribution . They had to wash his clothes after he saw you slit your own throat . All his sphincter muscles released . " She let herself laugh , though it was n't kind to be amused . Still , he had been so fervent that she could n't help laughing to think of the crisis of faith he must have had , to see the Mother of God apparently dying before Kristos could make an appearance . They stayed in the city for hours , talking and playing until the sun set behind Fort Senester in Gladmouth Bay . Then Angel took her home , to see her father . Never before had he looked so old and frail to her . A strange hollow look to his eyes , a sunken look to his skin . He was wasting . She was only thirteen years old , and her father was already beginning to die , before she ever had a chance to know him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she would be sure to know that this was for an audience , and not particularly for her . He commended her , commented on her behavior , criticizing freely some of the things she had done that she knew perfectly well he approved of completely . And when it was over , he handed her a slip of paper . On it was the name of Lord Jeeke of Riismouth , a marcher lord , one of the Fourteen Families . She was to visit him with her tutor as part of an educational tour of the kingdom . Lord Jeeke was to die no sooner than a week after she left , so that no one could connect her with his death . It was surprisingly simple . The journey took three days . On her first night there , she shared a wine glass with Lord Jeeke , which was filled with a nonhuman hormone that was , by itself , harmless . Then she infected Jeeke 's mistress with spores of a parasitic worm . The spores were passed to Jeeke through intimate contact ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They infested Jeeke 's brain , and three weeks later he was dead . She was already back in King 's Hill when the news reached them .  | She wrote letters of condolence to Jeeke 's family . Father read them and patted her shoulder . " Well done , Patience . " She was proud to have him say so . But she was also curious . " Why did King Oruc want him dead ? " " For the good of the King 's House . " " His personal pique , then ? " " The King 's House is n't Heptagon House , Patience . The King 's House is all the world . " " For the good of the world ? Jeeke was a gentle and harmless man . " " And a weak one . He was a marcher lord , and he had neglected his military duties . The world was more pleasant because he was a good man . But if his weakness had led , as was likely , to rebellion and border war , many would have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the sake of the King 's House . " " His life against the possibility of war . " " Some wars must be fought for the good of the King 's House . And some must be avoided . You and I are instruments in the hands of the King . " Then he kissed her , and as his mouth rested by her ear he whispered , " I 'm dying . I wo n't live three years . When I die , cut into my left shoulder , midway along and above the clavicle . You 'll find a tiny crystal . As you live , cut it out and keep it , whatever the cost . " Then he pulled away and smiled at her , as if nothing strange had been spoken . You can not die , Father , she cried out silently . In all my life we 've never spoken . You can not die . She performed four more assassinations for King Oruc , and a dozen other missions . She turned fourteen , and then fifteen . And all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker and older . On her tifteenth birthday he told her she did n't need a tutor anymore , and sent Angel away to be overseer of some lands he held outside the city . Patience knew what it meant . Not long after , Father woke up too weak to get out of bed . He sent the nearest servant to fetch a physician , and for a moment they were alone . Instantly he handed her a knife . " Now , " he whispered . She cut . lie did not even wince from the pain . She took from the wound a small crystal globe , beautiful and perfect . " The scepter of the Heptarchs of Imakulata , " he whispered . " The Usurper and his son never knew what or where it was . " He smiled , but In his pain his smile was ghastly . " Never let a gebling know you have it , " he said . A servant came in , realizing they had been left alone too long ; but she  | came too late and saw nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny amber-colored globe was in Patience 's pocket . Patience fingered it , pressed on it as if to squeeze some nectar from it . My father is dying , Father is dying , and the only thing I have from him is a hard little crystal I cut from his flesh , covered with his blood .  | The headsman stood outside the door as Patience waited for her father to die . He lay on the high bed , his face grey , his hands no longer trembling . Yesterday , the day before , as word of his final disease spread through King 's Hill and down into King 's Gift and High Town , a steady stream of visitors had come to say good-bye , to receive a final benediction . They all murmured some excuse to Patience as they left : We were friends in Balakaim . He taught me Dwelf . But she knew why they came . To touch , to see , to speak to the man who should have been I leptarch . There was blessing in the breath of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wisdom and brilliance from him all her life , watched the old man 's lips move in the forms of two dozen languages , babbling the empty phrases of courtesy that had been his stock in trade . It was as if Peace had to purge himself of all the words of grace before he died . " Father , " she whispered . The door opened suddenly . The headsman peered inside . " Not yet , " she said . " Go away . " But the headsman first waited until he saw Peace 's hand move a little . Then he closed the door again .  | Father lifted his hand to touch his collarbone , where a small wound was still unhealed . " Yes , " she said . His memory was going . He murmured . " I ca n't hear you , " she said . " Patience , " he whispered . She was not sure if he was saying her name or giving her a command . " Father , what should I do now ? How should I use my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured . " I ca n't hear you , Father . " " Serve and save , " he said in Dwelf . And then , in Gauntish , " The King 's House . " " Oruc will never let me serve him as you did , " she said in Geblic . He answered in Agarant , the common speech , which the headsman could surely understand . " The King 's House is all the world . " Even as he died , he had to make sure that the story of his loyalty reached Oruc 's ears . Patience saw what it was for : so Oruc would begin to doubt that Peace ever was disloyal to him . Let him wonder if he misjudged the both of us all along . But Patience knew it also had another meaning for her . Even though in her life she might never bear the title , she nevertheless had the Heptarch 's responsibility . She was to serve the world . She was to have universal magnanimity . " You taught me to survive , " she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Or a sacrifice , " said his breathless lips . Then his lips were still , and his body shuddered . The headsman heard the squeak of the bed and knew . He opened the door and came in , the headpot in his left hand , the long wire of the scalpel in his right . " Miss Patience , " he said , not looking at her , " it 's best you not watch this . " But she watched , and he could not stop her , since he had not a second to lose if he was to have the head alive . The scalpel was nothing but a coarser and stronger version of Patience 's own loop . He passed it around her father 's neck and locked the end of the wire in place . Then he whipped left and right , severing all the loose flesh and muscle instantly . It took a moment longer to work the wire through the cartilage and nerves between the vertabrae . Peace had been dead scarcely ten seconds before the headsman lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gently in the headpot . The headpot rocked a few moments as the gools that lived inside  | jostled for position on the veins and arteries of the open throat . They would keep the head alive until it could be installed in Slaves ' Hall . Of course they did not leave her the body , either . Lord Peace may have been the King 's ambassador in life , but in death his body was the corpse of the Last Pretender , and if the priests of Crossriver Delving or Lost Souls ' Island got their hands on it , there 'd be no end of trouble . So the diggers took him away to the King 's Boneyard , and she was alone in the house . She wasted no time  --  Father had told her long ago how dangerous would be the moment of his death . First protect secrets , he had always taught her . He had never kept many written documents . She found them all in moments and without hesitation she quickly burned them and raked the ashes into dust . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's flesh and swallowed it . She was n't sure whether the crystal it was made of could survive the process of digestion , but she did n't know what it was or how to implant it in her own body , and she did n't want it found if she were searched . She had already prepared her traveling bag . It was filled with the tools of survival . Masks and makeup and wigs , money and jewels , a small flask of water , pellets of sugar . Not much , so it would n't encumber her . But enough . Her weapons were concealed in the open , where she could reach them easily . The loop in her hair . The glass blowgun in the cross that hung fashionably between her breasts . The poison in a plastic pellet between her toes . She was ready to survive , had been ready throughout the deathwatch , knowing the Oruc would surely arrange for her to die at the same time as her father , if not of the same disease . She waited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been there , watching , spying all her life . If she had harbored any hopes that Oruc would let her live , the absence of the servants dispelled them . He wanted no witnesses , especially not witnesses whose tongues were professionally loose . There was a knock on the door . It was the bailiff . It would be the bailiff , then  --  he was one of the many King 's slaves trained to kill at the King 's command . He apologized and presented her with papers of eviction . " It 's a house for a King 's slave , Miss Patience , " he said , " and the King 's slave is dead , you see . " He stood between her and the other rooms of the house ; she would not be allowed to take any of her belongings , he explained . They had known it would be this way , of course . Angel had taken everything of consequence with him some time ago . She would get it when she left King 's Hill and joined him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bailiff made no sound that she consciously heard , nor was there a shadow . Perhaps it was the faintest trembling in the stone floor , or the slightest pressure of moving air on her hair . Without knowing how she knew , she knew that he was about to kill her . She lurched to the right , shifted her weight , and twisted and kicked all in a smooth motion . The bailiff had just begun to lunge with the dagger he held in his left hand , and now he had time only to show the surprise on his face as her foot caught him in the knee , bending it sideways . He gasped in agony and dropped the dagger . Some assassin , she thought with contempt . Did Oruc think that such an oaf could kill the daughter of Lord Peace ? It was not even a struggle . She left the dagger in his right eye . Only when the bailiff lay on the floor with the dagger sticking up like a jaunty decoration did she realize that this was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King . It was surprisingly easy , and she enjoyed thwarting him even more than she had enjoyed serving him . King Oruc , you have made a foolish mistake by not trying to use me in my father 's place . I have a certain flair for government work . And now it will work against you . Then she reminded herself that she was still not Oruc 's enemy , even if he had chosen to be hers . She was the servant of the King 's House , and she would do nothing to weaken his reign unless she knew it would bring about a greater good . She went to the door and opened it at once . There would be soldiers all around , of course , but it was likely that they did not know she was supposed to be killed . There was too much lingering support for the ancient bloodline . So as long as she seemed calm , she could probably get by . No , not calm . Grief-stricken . She wept as she left the house . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feminine sobbing that roused the pity of men and made them feel strong and protective . " Damned shame , " one of the soldiers whispered as she passed . And she knew that all of them were thinking : She should be Heptarch . She should be in Heptagon House , and now they wo n't even let her stay in King 's Hill . But she was thinking that she would be lucky to live till morning . Angel had told her to go to Admiralty Row at once , as soon as they tried to kill her . They had developed three separate escape plans . But she did not intend to use any of them . After all , she knew at least as much about the ways in and out of King 's Hill as he did . As a child ,  | permanently trapped within the walls of the King 's quarter , she had been free to explore as she liked , and she knew ways over and under walls , through hidden passages in buildings , and though she had grown too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still get from here to there in many different ways . And she was not going to leave King 's Hill until she had spoken to her father 's head . He had been so distant , so subtle in his life , but she would get some secrets from him now . He would talk to her now as he had never talked to her in life . It was a simple matter to dodge into the well-tended gardens of King 's Wood . The ground was soft , taking footprints easily , but she was soon clambering from limb to limb among the trees . These giants had been old trees when her great-grandfather ruled in Heptagon House and the Fourteen Families had offered their heads to him forever . Now their leaves concealed her and their branches were her highway to the south wall of the garden . They could not follow her footsteps in the air . She paused once in a safe cluster of branches to strip off her women 's clothing . Underneath it she wore the short breeches and long shirt of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the part , since boys took to long pants or professional gowns as soon as they could these days . At least her breasts were not too large yet , and Father had been gracious enough not to die when it was her time of month . She smudged her face , pulled off her wig , and tousled her short hair . She decided to keep the wig  --  it was a perfect match for her hair , and she 'd be hard put to find another . She stuffed it into her bag . The dress she jammed into the crook of a branch . It was black , of course , and it would n't be easy to see it from the ground . It was already dusk when she got to the wall and dropped to the ground on Granary Row . No one saw her . She appropriated one of the drawcarts and pulled it by its rope to Larder Row . After years of practice with Angel , her boyish stride was utterly convincing . No one took a second look at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as so many servants did , to pay her respects to the dead in Slaves ' Hall . If those who saw her had thought to examine her face , they might have known her  --  the daughter of Lord Peace had the best-known face in King 's Hill . But the essence of disguise , Angel had always said , is to avoid close examination . The clothing , the walk , the dirt , the coarseness kept them from noticing her at all . The doorkeeper was n't there . He rarely was , and would have caused her no problem if he had been . He was almost blind . She wandered among the shelves of living heads . She had spent many hours here , and knew most of the faces , had talked to many of them .  | Long-dead ministers of long-dead kings , they had once wielded vast power or influenced monarchs or served as the King 's voice in hundreds of foreign courts . As usual , most of the eyes were closed , since few of the dead took much pleasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreamed , calling up with perfect clarity all that they had ever seen and felt in their lives . Only a few of them watched her pass ; even if one of them had been able to muster up some curiosity , he could not have turned his head to see where she would go . Father would not be here , of course , not upstairs among the favorites . It would be too soon for that  --  his head had to be trained and broken to the King 's will first . So Patience made her way to the place under the stairs where a wooden louver in the heating vent was missing . The weather was warm enough that none of the ovens was alight ; the air was cool in the stone passageway . She climbed downward into the darkness . At the bottom she turned  --  left ? ? yes , left , and crawled until she came to a wooden grating on the floor . It was dark under her . They had not yet started on Father , then . So she lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds that funneled through the heating system . There were places all over Slaves ' Hall where conversations could be heard distinctly in these passages . A good part of Patience 's self-education in politics had taken place here , as she listened to the cleverest ministers and ambassadors pry for information from the dead or conspire for power with the living . To her surprise , they did come to Slaves ' Hall looking for her  --  she heard the soldiers ask the gatekeeper and search the public floors . But they were searching in a desultory way , not because they expected to find her here but because they had been told to search everywhere . Good . They had lost her in King 's Wood and had no idea where she had gone from there . Later , the headkeeper came into the cellar room , lit the bright oil lamps , and began to work on her father . She had heard and seen the process often enough before . It took less than an hour to link the headworms with the nerves in her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes writhed in agony , for most nerves caused pain when they were awakened by the headworms . Finally , though , the headkeeper dismissed his apprentices . The physical process was finished . His neck bones were attached to a rack , his windpipe was attached to the breath bladder , and his neck was just touching the gel that sustained the headworms that clung to his nerves and the gools that sent tendrils  | through his blood vessels . They would keep his head alive , his memories intact , for the next thousand years  --  or until a King grew tired of him and had his head thrown out . The headkeeper talked to him then , asking him questions . He taught the headworms by dripping certain chemicals into the canister when lord Peace 's answers were forthright , and other chemicals when he hesitated or seemed agitated . The headworms quickly learned which of the head 's nerves caused pleasure and which caused suffering . In a short time they were ready , and needed no more stimulation from the headkeeper . Now the headworms would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying . Then they in turn would stimulate other nerves , so the head felt extremes of urgent needs  --  the bowel or bladder full , the belly famished , the throat dry with thirst , the nerves of sexual pleasure on the edge of orgasm but never quite there . When the head answered truthfully , it got some measure of relief . When it lied , the longings increased until they were agony . Isolated from their bodies , heads never had much stamina , and their will was usually broken in a single night , however much they might resist . Patience calmed herself , prepared herself to listen to her father endure much before the worms broke him . And at first it seemed his resistance might be long and painful . Then to her surprise he began to whine . It was a sound she had never heard before , and she thought she knew all his voices . " No matter what I do , " he said . " You can always make it worse and worse . " " That 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things you most long for , and you 'll never be satisfied until you learn to speak the truth . " " Ask me again . Ask me anything . " They did , and he told them . No resistance at all . Intimate things , terrible things , secrets of state , secrets of his own body . Patience listened in disgust . She had been prepared for her father 's pain , but not for his quick capitulation . They thought he was resisting them when he said he did n't know where Patience was . But Patience knew that he had held nothing back . Perhaps he had known he would break this easily  --  perhaps that 's why he had prepared so well for her escape . He must have known his own weakness , though he concealed it from everyone else until now . " I knew that you 'd ask me , and so I made sure I did n't know . I told Angel a year ago to make plans with her , and tell me nothing of them . Then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away  --  I knew  | they 'd kill her bodyguard first . Patience is on her own until she can meet him . But Angel and I trained my daughter carefully , gentlemen . She speaks every language that I speak , she is a more accomplished assassin than Angel himself , and she is cleverer by far than any adviser to the king . You will never catch her . She 's probably gone already . " The headkeeper finally believed him . " We 'll tell the King you 're ready now . " " Will he come and talk to me ? " asked the head . " If he wants to . But no one else ever will . With the things you know , there 's no chance he 'll put you in a public room . Who knows ? Maybe he 'll install you in his private chambers . " The headkeeper laughed . " You can watch every intimate moment of the King 's life , and he can get your advice whenever he wants it . There is precedent , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck . King Oruc is not . " " You hope , " said the headkeeper . " King Oruc is a great Heptarch . " The headkeeper looked at him suspiciously . Then he smiled . " You really do mean it . And all this time everyone thought you served Oruc because your daughter was a hostage . Turns out you really were loyal . A weakling . " The headkeeper slapped him lightly on the cheek . " You were nothing , and now you 're less than nothing . " He doused the lights and left . As soon as he was gone and the brass key turned in the lock , Patience lifted the grating and dropped into the room . " Hullo , Father , " she said . She fumbled in the darkness until she found his breath bladder . Then she pumped air so he could speak . " Go away , " he said . " I already taught you everything I know . " " I know , " she said . " Now I want you to tell me everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he said . " Right now I 'm voiding my bladder , which I have n't done without pain in three years . Go away . " " You have neither bladder nor urine , Father . It 's just an illusion . " " The only reality a human being ever knows , my darling girl , is what his nerves tell him , and mine are telling me that  --  oh , you vicious and ungrateful worm of a girl , the headworms are torturing me again because I 'm resisting you . " " Then do n't resist me , Father . " " I 'm not your father , I 'm a piece of dead brain tissue kept alive by the probing tendrils of the gools and stimulated by trained worms . " " You never were my father . " Was that a catch in his throat ? A tiny  | gasp of surprise ? " You always made speeches to me , for the servants to overhear . Angel was the only father I had . " " Do n't waste your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did you ever love me ? " " I do n't remember . If I did , I certainly do n't love you anymore . The only thing I desire now is to urinate forever . I would gladly trade a daughter for a decent prostate . " She found the matches where the headkeepers had set them down , and lit a single lamp . Her father 's eyes blinked in the light . She smiled at him . " You 're going to tell Oruc everything , but you 're going to tell me first . All my life you 've been able to keep secrets from me . But not anymore . " " You do n't need to know any of the secrets . I saw to it you knew everything . I thought you were intelligent enough to know that every word Angel spoke to you came originally from my lips . " " He told me that you would willingly let me die if it would serve the best interests of the King 's House . " " What would you rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more important than the whole world ? What sort of egomaniacal monster are you ? " " A human being , " she said . " The worst kind of monster , " he said . " We 're all monsters , living in utter isolation , sending out words like ambassadors that beg for tribute , for worship . Love me , love me . And then when the words come back , ' I love you , I worship you , you are great and good , ' these monsters doubt , these monsters know that it 's a lie . ' Prove it , ' they say . ' Obey me , give me power . ' And when they are obeyed , the monster grows hungrier . ' How do I know you are n't manipulating me ? ' cries the monster . ' If you love me , die for me , kill for me , give all to me and leave nothing for yourself ! ' " " If human beings are all monsters , why should I sacrifice anything for them ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And when they live in a network of peace and hope , when they trust the world and their deepest hungers are fulfilled , then within that system , that delicate web , there is joy . That is what we live for , to bind the monsters together , to murder their fear and give birth to their beauty . " " That 's as mystical as what the priests babble about . " " It is what the priests babble about . " " You have sacrificed the possibility of power , you have made us strangers all these years , and all for some invisible , nonexistent connec- tion between human beings you 've never even met ? " She tried to put as much contempt as possible into her voice . " You 're fifteen . You know nothing . Go away . " " I know your life has been a deception and a disguise . " " And when I dropped the disguise and told you what I have lived for , you mocked me . The babble of the priests ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exist ? There is nothing but empty space between the infinitesimal pieces of matter ; the only thing connecting them is their behavior , their influence on each other , and yet out of those empty , invisible connections is built all that exists in the universe . Most of it empty , the web insensible . Yet if for a single moment the web broke down , everything would flash out of existence . Do you think it 's any different for us ? Do you think that you exist independent of your connections with other people ? Do you think that you can ever serve your own interest without also serving theirs ? Then I should have killed you in the cradle , because you are n't fit to be Heptarch . " She saw in his face the same fervency she had seen in Prekeptor . Father , too , was a believer . But she could not believe that this was a belief that anyone could sacrifice for . " Was this the secret you hid from me all these years ? Was this what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could have been alone and honest with each other ? Was this what I yearned for all my life ? " He had taught her how to show devastating contempt , as a diplomatic tool . She used it now : " I could have learned as much from any teacher in the School . " His face went slack again , went back to the neutral expression that he cultivated when he wished to show nothing . " If you do n't get out of here at once , before Oruc or his men get here , you 're quite likely to be with me in loving proximity for the next thousand years , getting sucked out by gools in a bowl of soup . I do n't like you well enough to want your company . I used to think you were a well-behaved child , but now I see you 're a selfish , inconsiderate brat . " " No , " she said . " There are things I need to know . Practical things , that I can use to survive . " " Survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go away . " " What was it that you feared the most ? " His face took on a mockingly devoted expression . " That you would die . I did all that I did to keep you alive . Why else do you think I served the Usurper 's Son so faithfully ? He had you hostage here . " He wanted her to believe that he was lying . But she could also see that the headworms were not tormenting him . He had told her the truth . He simply did n't want her to know it was the truth . So she was  | asking the questions that would give her the answers she wanted . " Why were you afraid of my death ? " " Because I loved you . Back when I was alive . I remember it dimly . " But this was a lie . She could see the trembling around his lips ; the headworms were in control of his nerves , and tortured him in unconcealable ways when he resisted . So it was n't love . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a time in her early childhood , to the night that most haunted her nightmares . There was something in his face now that reminded her of his face that night . " You lied to me that night , " she said . " I realize now , you lied about something . " " What night ? " he asked . " What was it you did n't tell me , Father , the night they brought you Mother 's body in seven sacks ? " " You remember that ? " " For some reason it sticks in my mind . " He raised an eyebrow . " I do n't remember it . " " Now more than ever you remember . " " God help me , if I must remember that night , then have the grace to take me from this rack and let me die . " " That night when you opened the first sack and saw what it was , you shouted , ' I ' 11 never go , I 'll never let you have her , not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ? What was it that made you so afraid ? You trembled , Father . I never saw you tremble before or since . " " I was afraid of King Oruc , of course . " " You never were afraid of him . And lying does you no good  --  see what the headworms do with you ? " Abruptly he changed tactics . He smiled , and wryly said , " Even the headkeeper had some mercy . Now I feel like I 've been constipated for a month and a diarrhea attack is beginning . You have no idea how bad these worms can be . " " Tell me now and have your ease . " Lightly he said , as if it did n't matter , " I feared the call to Cranning . It was the caller that I shouted at , whoever it was . " " Who else could it be but the gebling king ? " asked Patience . " Oh , you think you 've solved it ? " " Angel told me that the gebling kings have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From mind to mind . " " Did Angel tell you that this power of the geblings has never touched a human being ? We 're deaf as a post when the geblings cry out to each other . "  | " The Cranning call  --  if it is n't the geblings , who is it , and why do you fear it ? " " I do n't know who it is , but I fear him . I fear what he can do to people . The Wise of Grandfather 's day were brilliant and strong , the greatest minds in the history of the world , working together , building on each other 's learning , until they did things that had never been done on any world . Here , where iron is so hard to find that we can never rely on the machines that have always made humans powerful , they unlocked the powers of life . They were n't just petty breeders , like the Tassaliki , like the ancient scientists who created these headworms and gools four thousand years ago  --  those were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught the chromosomes to name themselves in crystals , atom for atom , in patterns that could be seen and read by the naked eye . They had found how passion fish mate with clams to make cressid plants . And when I was born , they changed me so that I could never sire anything but sons . " Patience thought about that for a moment . " They did it so the prophecy would n't be fulfilled . So there 'd be no seventh seventh seventh daughter . " " That was the plan . " " Why did you change your mind ? Why did you have Angel undo what they did ? Surely you did n't become a Watcher . " " No , not a Watcher . The Wise did this to me when I was still a child . As soon as they had made my body incapable of siring girlchildren , the Cranning call began . One by one , the best of them began to leave . They would go off to teach somewhere . They would retire to a country home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they would never arrive at their destination . Instead they would be seen along the rivers and roads leading to Cranning . " " Your father was Heptarch then ? " " Not yet . My father watched what happened to the empire , as all the able men disappeared . He went to them and begged them not to go . The ones who had n't yet felt the Cranning call vowed most solemnly to stay . The ones who had felt it , though  --  they promised anything , but they broke all their promises . And Grandfather did nothing to stop it . It was a frightening time , with provinces in rebellion , the army in disarray . Father finally had Grandfather arrested and took over the government . " " So the Usurper was n't the first to overthrow a Heptarch . " " For the good of the King 's House , even treason . Yes . But it was too late . Even when he tortured some of them , even when he killed some as  | an example , they went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , in Slaves ' Hall , the Cranning call was so strong in their minds that the headworms had no power over them . The Cranning call was more urgent than anything the headworms could do to them . " " What were they wanted for ? " " Do you think Father did n't try to find out ? But they themselves did n't know . And no one ever knew what became of them , once they got to Cranning . Father 's spies never came back . And after a few years , the empire was lost . Twelve of the Fourteen Families were in revolt . Oruc 's father led it . But he was n't called the Usurper then . He was called the Liberator . He came , he said , to restore Grandfather to his rightful place on the Heptarch 's throne . " " Ah . " " Father should have killed Grandfather . " " As Oruc should have killed us ? " " Grandfather was n't the  --  seventh seventh seventh daughter . " Lord Peace closed his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would put his fingertips together , then touch them to his mouth ; she could almost see his hands rise . She felt the grief for his death well up in her for the first time , seeing him half-alive like this , remembering him whole . She shook off the feeling . " How was I born , Father ? " " My father lost the city of Heptam before I came of age . I led one army , he led another . He lost and was captured and killed . I never lost . I wandered the wilderness with an ever-shrinking guerrilla band . One by one my sons came to adulthood . One by one they were killed . The enemy seemed to find my boys so easily  --  as if some traitor led them . It was as if some terrible invisible power guided them to destroy everyone but me . Everyone but me . My first wife , my father , my children , and I alone was alive . " " So you could sire the daughter of prophecy . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall began almost the moment they undaughtered me . That was the crime for which the Wise were taken and the throne was lost . You see , Patience , the prophecies that these men of science had long thought were mere superstition  --  someone or something of great power meant to have them ful filled . And we thought  --  perhaps if we find a way to undo what was lil , u done . Perhaps if I could have a girichild , then the Wise would come home , and all could be restored as it was . Peace could be restored to the world . But how could we undo the work of the Wise , so my daughter  | could be born ? Who would know how to do it , when the Wise were all gone ? " " Angel , " said Patience . " I know this story . " " I was in my forties then . He came to me , a very young man then , and said he had been studying the journals of the great men , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman-making sperm . He explained , but I could not understand it  --  I know what every educated man knows about genetics , but he was deep in the chemistry and mathematics of it , catalysts and countercatalysts and inducers and blocks . I said to him , You know too much . You 've become one of the Wise . The Cranning call will come to you . ' He only smiled and said , Lord Peace , my Heptarch , if the caller wants you to have a daughter , then he will leave me here . ' " " So my birth . .. served the purpose of the Cranning call . " " Angel and I argued over it . Better to be castrated than to give in to what this enemy wants , I said . But it came to this : We did n't know what purpose the Cranning call might have for you , but we knew that as long as you remained unborn , the world was in turmoil . We were at Ilium at the time , under the protection of Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The seventh seventh seventh daughter is called the destruction of the world , and the salvation of the world . Why not let her be born , and then teach her to be a savior ? ' So I took Lady Hekat as my second wife , and Angel made the change in me , and you were , born . " " Lady Hekat . " Patience saw her mother 's face as it had been the last time she saw her . Weeping as the soldiers took Patience away from her . Crying out , My daughter , my daughter , my child , God be with you , always with you ; and then the knock on Father 's door , and the sudden cry of agony as father looked into the bag that was delivered there . I saw his face . His face , Mother 's face , the same agony . " And you trained me to be an assassin , " she said . " I taught you to serve the King 's House . However much you think you hate me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good of the King 's House . You are the hope of humanity . Not as the Watchers and Vigilants believe , as the mere mother of some imagined god . You yourself . I know it . " " I 'm a child , fifteen years old . I 'm the hope of nothing . I have no great purpose . " " If you have no purpose of your own , then you will fulfill the purpose of the Cranning call . It waits for you , Daughter . But Angel and I have  | done all we could to teach you what the Heptarch lives for . If you have n't learned it , we could do no more . " " You do n't know anything , Father . You do n't know who is calling from Cranning , you do n't know what he wants me for , and you do n't even know me . " " How could I know you , Patience ? I felt the Cranning call , too . Are you surprised ? I never felt it until you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take you there , to carry you to Skyfoot and give you ? to whatever waits there . Whenever I was with you , all your life , I have felt a longing worse than anything these petty worms can do to me . So I have spent as little time with you as I could , for fear I would ' ' break under the pain of it , and carry you off before you were ready . " " Ready for what ? " " To face whatever waits there . " " Am I ready now ? " " How can I know ? But you 're as ready as I could make you in my life . Trust Angel now . He is the last of the Wise , the only one who can protect you from the thing that calls . From Unwyrm . " " You know its name ? " " One prophecy says that you will take the world into Unwyrm 's lair and give it to him , and all mankind will die and be reborn . It 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophecy ? " " A prophet , I suppose . What matters is that the Cranning call is proof that the prophecies are true  --  or some undefeatable power wants to make them true , which amounts to the same thing . " " There 's no such thing as an undefeatable power , " said Patience . " You always taught me that . " " Go now , Patience . I 've told you everything . Now do n't let them find you here , or my whole life was for nothing . And if they ask me , I 'll have to tell them that I saw you . It 'll give them a fresh trail . " Almost she obeyed him . But then she realized that he had not fully answered her . There was still a twitching in his face , a sign that he was resisting , that he had not told her all that she had asked for . " One more story , " she said . " No more . " 1 " The one you do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to resist the urging of the worms . " Leave me in peace , child ! Let my name be something more than a terrible irony . "  | " Whatever you want so badly not to tell , that is the thing I most badly need to know . " " You 're wrong , you fool ! If you needed to know I would have told you ! Leave me this one secret to take to the grave . " " I 'll have it from you , Father ! I 'll have it , or wait here until Oruc takes me ! " Finally , sweating and weeping , the head spoke . Patience pumped steadily , but the voice was high and strange . " The priests say that the Starship Captain was taken in the spirit by God , made some prophecies , and then disappeared into heaven . " " I know the tales . " " I know the truth . The captain of the starship Konkeptoine went mad as our ancestors orbited the world . It 's true that he wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also drew the map of the world , showing all the great deposits of iron and coal , the stuff that steel is made of . Then he used the ship 's powers to destroy those deposits . In that one act he determined the future of the world . Imakulata is not naturally poor in iron . Because of his insane act of destruction , we children of the great engine builders are deprived of steel . We have no great machines . We are weaker in this world than human beings have ever been before . " " If he was insane enough to do that , why did anyone think he was a prophet ? " " Because his map was more accurate than the one the ship 's own mind drew . He knew things about the world that could not be known . They said at the time he seemed to be possessed . I who have felt the Cranning call know now that this was probably true . Whatever controlled him in the ship , that compulsive power is still alive . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen again . His craft was never found . " " If something like this happened , why is n't it in any of the histories ? " " There are stories passed from Heptarch to Heptarch that none of the historians know . I meant you to know this much , anyway ; I told Angel , and he was to tell you . The priests know only of the map he drew with his right hand , and the words he spoke with his mouth . The words that his possessor wanted us to believe . Words about how Kristos would come to Imakulata and make the human race new and perfect . But his daughter Irena , the first Heptarch , she saw something that only the Heptarchs know : As he spoke the prophecy and drew the map with his right hand , his left hand slowly tapped out into the mind of the ship ,  | ' Save my daughter from the lair of the wyrms , or they will devour all mankind . ' " " His daughter ? " " Not Irena , child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know how distant . There were prophecies that it would be the seventh seventh daughter . Magic numbers . Only in the last thousand years have there been prophets who said that the Daughter of Prophecy , the Mother of God , is to be the seventh seventh seventh daughter of the Starship Captain . " " Then there 's no reason to believe that the prophecy is anything more than the raving of a Vigilant . " " Of course . Except that the Cranning call obviously intends to fulfill that prophecy . I have no doubt that you are the daughter that needs saving , as the Starship Captain warned . " " But what is the lair of the worms  --  this ? The headworms ? " " He wrote a word that in Star Speech , the most ancient of languages , means ' monster , ' and not just any monster , but the most dangerous and cunning and powerful of enemies . An enemy powerful enough to take control of the Starship Captain 's mind while the Konkeptoine still orbited Imakulata . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you understand the danger of the world , Patience ? We are facing an enemy that formed its plans seven thousand years ago , when we first arrived here . Whatever ruled Imakulata before humankind came here wants to rule again . " " A gebling then . They were the highest native life , as intelligent as humankind ? " " Were they ? Then why is Geblic merely another corrupt form of Star Speech ? And Dwelf and Gauntish , why did they have to take their language from mankind ? They rose to where they are when humanity arrived ; there was something more powerful , an intelligence older than they . I meant for Angel to warn you of this . I did n't mean for you to be ignorant of it . But that 's all now . That 's all , now go . " But even now , there was more , she could see what the headworms told her , that he was hiding still another secret from her . The headkeeper had n't broken him . His power of resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headkeeper had failed to do . She would break him and have from him the tale he did n't want to tell . " I know you better than that , Father , " she said . " If I am such a danger to the world , you would have killed me in my childhood . " " The Starship Captain did n't say to kill his daughter . He said to save her . And even if he had not said so , I could not have killed you . Anyone  | else could die , child , anyone at all , but you would live . To destroy mankind or to save the world , I can not guess , but you would live , whatever the cost . " " Why ! Not because I 'm your daughter  --  so why ! " His face twisted in agony . She had asked him the unbearable question , and the headworms would torture the answer from him . But even as she realized this , she also remembered something else . This was the expression on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask of pain he wore . " In all your talking , Father , you never told me what you meant when you cried out on the night they brought Mother 's body to you . " His mouth opened wide to form a scream that never sounded . " The Cranning call . For me , the need was n't for me to come . It was to bring you . Whole and alive . When I was n't with you , I felt no call at all . " " That does n't answer my ? " " Your mother was always with you . She was also called . She was weaker than I was . She tried to take you . That 's why I carried you away from her . She vowed she would never rest until she had you back , that she would do anything to get you away from me . " Even now , though the dread was thick within her , she could not bring herself to understand what he meant . " Listen , foolish girl ! Did n't Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weak enough to let Grandfather live , when he should have died . I was stronger than my father was . Hekat meant to take you to Cranning . I had no strength to kill you , against the Cranning call , but I still had strength . " Patience stopped pumping breath for him . " You , " she whispered . " You told me it was a group of soldiers trying to curry favor with Oruc . You told me  --  they were even executed for it ? but it was you . " His lips formed words as he ran out of air . I never meant to tell you . His eyes accused her . You made the tell you , and you did n't need to know . It was more than she could bear . " Why did n't you let her take me to Cranning . I would rather have suffered anything , and have her live . " " The King 's House is all the world , " said his lips . " You were n't the Heptarch ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't have to kill my mother ! " And she swept him from the table , spilling him to the floor .  | At once she rushed to him , to lift the head back to the table , restore the gel that would keep his gools alive . But he looked at her steadily as she knelt over him , and his lips moved and said , Let me die . So she did the only thing she could do . She took Lord Peace by the jaw and tore the head away from the rack that held it . The headworms wriggled in the open air and the gools slid off and slopped onto the floor . All the time her father 's eyes looked at her in gratitude and love . Then , gasping with grief and fury , she tossed the head through the open grate in the ceiling and climbed up after it . She carried it with her for ten minutes as she scrambled through the heating system to the vent by the garrison barracks . By then it was dead beyond reviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Let the soldiers explain to King Oruc how she got it there without being seen . No . She could not leave his head like the carcass of a cat in the street . Not that he would care  --  he was beyond such concerns as respect and dignity . It was herself she was concerned for , Patience who could not bear to treat even this fragment of her father 's body with disrespect . What she could not understand was why she did not hate him . He had killed Mother . All his weeping when they showed how she had been mutilated , all his grief , all his embraces as he tried to comfort his daughter  --  and he was the one who killed her . All because of some madness about an ancient prophecy . Seven thousand years ago their ancestor went mad , and a few hundred thinkers took unlicensed trips to the gebling city , and for that her mother was murdered by her own husband . Yet it was this monster who had made her what she was . For her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shame him in death . Not because she loved him . She certainly , certainly did not love him . As she made her way along the ledges of the cliff outside the wall of King 's Hill , she filled her father 's throat and mouth with rocks and tossed the cold , misshapen thing into the sea .  | Angel was supposed to be in disguise , lecturing on astrophysics in the School . But he was n't there . It did n't surprise her . She was supposed to have arrived almost as soon as word first reached the city that Peace was dead . Every minute she delayed made it more dangerous for Angel , who was not unknown and might be recognized despite his disguise . Perhaps he had stayed until nightfall  --  but he would certainly not have dared to stay the night inside the city . There were too many tongues paid well to wag , too many eyes that would see and remember the new teacher who had not been seen or heard of before . Perhaps , though , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , she passed the early hours of day like the many students searching for a teacher whose haranguing was particularly pleasing . She was tired , after a night without sleep . But part of her regimen had been sleeplessness , from time to time , staying awake and alert against the urging of her body . Angel and Father had stretched her limits so far that she no longer knew where they were . She quickly recognized the spies circulating through the crowd . They had not been trained by Father or Angel ; they were not subtle , and Patience knew she was not the only one who could tell they were not  | earnest seekers after truth . Many a teacher became tongue-tied when a spy came near , and tried to purge his doctrine of anything that smacked of sedition . Patience also knew that the spies she saw were not the dangerous ones . It was the spies she could not discern who frightened her . So she made her way into Kingsport , the warehouse and shipping district that had once been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of its own laws . Great Market , only a short way up from the docks , stank of fish and sausages , alcohol and spice . It would not do to linger too long without buying  --  the merchants hired their own spies to search for thieves . So she made her way to the tonguing booths . She stopped at the canopy of a man whose sign promised he could translate Agarant to Dwelf , Dwelf to Gauntish , Gauntish to Geblic , and then back to common speech without a word changed . It was so extravagant an impossibility that she liked the man at once . She leaned on his writing table . He looked up at her from heavy brows and thick moustaches and said , in Agarant , " Take your hands off my table or I 'll cut them off . " Patience answered in Panx that she knew was accentless . " My hands for your mealbag , it 's a fair trade . " He squinted at her . " Nobody ever needs Panx , " he said . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gablic . " Then perhaps you can use my services somewhere else . " " Did n't you understand me ? I do n't need Panx . " Now she spoke in common speech . " The last thing I said was in Geblic . So much for your sign . " " I 've never known a gebling merchant who could n't speak Agarant , so no one needs it anyway . How did you learn Panx and Geblic ? " " I 'm a gebling , " she said . " Your barber is very good . " He smiled . " Listen , boy , as long as you 're here , I could use a scribe . How 's your hand ? " " Good enough , as long as I can sit there in the shade , with something to keep sun off my neck . " " And the common gaze off your face , is that it ? " " I 'm not afraid of the common gaze , sir . " " Ah . It 's the uncommon gaze you dread . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding from , as long as you do n't steal from me ? Though by the grandmother of Kristos , there 's not much to steal . My name is Planner . At least that 's what my merchant 's license says . " So she sat through the day , writing out in her trained and beautiful  | hand what Flanner had scribbled . Often she corrected his tendency to translate idioms literally , giving the sense instead of the words ; if he noticed , he did n't say . He sent a streetboy for dinner at noon , and shared the food with her . At day 's end , when all the clients had come by and there was no work left except a book that was n't due till spring , Flanner stood up and rubbed his hands together . " Still an hour till full dark . What do you plan to do now ? " " Help you pitch your canopy . " " And then ? " " Ask you for six coppers for my day 's work . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awning and the four posts . It all collapsed into sticks and cloth that fit inside his table ; two of the sticks became axles , and the table was now a cart . " Now , boy , it occurs to me that three times today I had to step over there to the pisspit , and you not once . " " Some have larger bladders than others , " she said . But she knew he would not give her the money , and he was perilously close to guessing who she was , if he had n't already . So she reached into her hair and took out her loop . She flipped it down across his wrist , caught the ends to form a circle around it , and smiled . " Twenty-five coppers with the other hand , " she said , " or you lose this one . " He saw the wire more than felt it . With only slight pressure it had cut into the skin and blood was forming droplets . His other hand took a purse from his belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I did an honest day 's work , " she said . " But I charge extra when people try to cheat me . Spill the purse . " He poured out the coins on the tabletop . " A silver and five coppers , count them out and put them back in the purse . " He did it , being careful not to move the caught hand any more than necessary . When he had pulled taut the string of the purse , she snatched it with one hand , letting the loop dangle from the other . He did not try to catch her , just held his bleeding wrist and panted in relief . " And remember that pleiok can be future tense as well as past . It gets you into more trouble . " She dodged away into the gathering dusk , Another day was ending , another day of putting herself at terrible risk in a public place , and Angel had n't found her . No doubt the rumor of the boy who could speak four languages and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before morning  --  it was the kind of tale that spread fast through the taverns . Unfortunately , the King 's  | spies would also hear it , so she could n't wait for Angel to find her from the tales . Her purse bought her passage on an upriver boat . All the outbound boats were being watched closely , but the ferries that carried gamblers and gainers to the Cuts needed no supervision , apparently . The porter who took her three coppers looked at her with squinting eyes . " You know they put cutpurses in the river in three pieces , " he said . Patience looked at the planks to avoid his gaze . So she looked like a thief in this company . Should n't be a surprise . Only the well off could play the Cuts , and she did n't exactly reek of money . But as Angel left , he had jokingly said that he figured to spend his time getting rich in the Cuts , because he was mathematician enough to control the odds . It was the only hint she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted on it . She paid the extra copper to use the privy house on the boat . It was a long pole upstream when the tide was out , and there was a queue . A very fat , foul-breathed woman got in line behind her . Her belly and breasts kept bumping into Patience , as if to urge her forward . She did n't want to make a scene , though , and so bore it patiently . But when the man before her got out , to her horror the woman pushed her way into the privy behind her . Patience had never pictured herself having to kill someone quite so grossly fat . How deep would a weapon have to pierce in order to touch something vital ? It did n't matter  --  a throat was a throat . By the time the fat woman had the door closed , Patience had her loop out and easily cast it about the woman 's neck . " Make a sound and you 're dead , " said Patience . The woman made no sound . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know if you meant to rob me or what , but if you keep silent and say nothing , I 'll let you finish this voyage alive . " " Please , " the fat woman whispered . Patience tightened the loop . A sudden slackening of resistance told her that it had bitten flesh . " I said silence , " Patience said . " Angel , " the fat woman squeaked . She had n't expected that . She was keyed up against enemies , and had n't thought the woman might be a friend . " What about Angel ? " " He 's coming on the next boat . In the name of Cleanliness and Holiness and all the Sweet Smells , take that thing from around my neck . He said you were dangerous but he did n't say you were insane . " " Who are you ? " " Sken . I own a boat . I think I wet myself . "  | " Good . Then you do n't need the privy house . I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what will they think , when I come out with my throat bleeding ? " " That you made an indecent offer to a young man in the privy , and he turned you down with vigor . I 'll meet you at the railing  --  now go . " " You 're a little turd , " said Sken . She left , holding her neck . Patience barred the door and finally relieved herself . It had been a long day . Now she understood why the heads gave in so easily when the worms tortured them with these body urges . Angel had found her after all , apparently , had been watching her until he had a chance to send word to her . Whoever this woman was , Angel trusted her . No doubt the fact that she owned a boat played some part in his plans . But will it play a part in mine ? Patience wondered what Angel was to her now . Father 's slave , and so now hers , technically . But she knew he did n't really belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take him into court to enforce her claim . He had served her father , not from fear , but from love and loyalty . One of the lessons of statecraft , Father often told her , was that loyalty could not be transferred or inherited ; it had to be earned by each new lord in turn . Angel might now feel no loyalty at all , or believe that he was still bound to carry out whatever Father 's last instructions to him might have been . Patience , though , did n't feel bound to obey Father . She obeyed him for the last time when she tore his head from the rack and cast it into the sea . His desires were not to be added into the balance anymore . She was not a child , now . She could decide for herself what to do with the burden of prophecy and doom that had attended from her birth , that had unthroned her grandfather and killed her half-brothers . And killed her mother , too ; dear Mother , who had died so cruelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for my sake , Mother , if I could have , I would have died for you but now your death has bought for me all that it could buy  --  the years to become dangerous , too , in my own right . Have n't I killed in the name of the King ? Did n't I leave my own assassin with a dagger in his eye ? Did n't I steal Father 's head out of Slaves ' Hall though all the soldiers in King 's Hill looked for me ? I am not a little child or a helpless Heptarch whose servants have made her soft . I will not refuse the path that prophecy has declared for me , but I will not be half so meek as prophecy thinks I 'll be . I will be more than a match for Unwyrm , whoever or whatever Unwyrm is . So she leaned on the gunnel of the boat as the oarsmen below decks swept the river , pushing the waves westward toward the sea . Glad Hell 's high prison wall loomed in the gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lights of Heptam were visible far to the south , across the marshes . I am outside the prison walls now , she thought . I am outside King 's Hill , and I 'll never go back there , except as Ileptarch . Inwardly she laughed at the thought . Whatever else she might be or do in her life , the Heptarchy was the thing furthest out of reach . She would set herself to other tasks , and let the Heptarchy come to her if it would . King 's Hill was not the only prison she was free of . Those walls had always been the least of her jails . The training regimen was over . The constant tests and problems were ended . Never again would others determine her present and future according to their own desires . Instead she would go where she was born to go . To Cranning , the great Skyfoot city at the center of the world . How could she , for a moment , think of going anywhere else ? She felt a tingling of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her loins , a hunger deeper than any she had felt before in her life . Cranning . All roads go there , all rivers flow there , all time bends there , all life ends there . I t became a pounding rhyme in her head . All roads go there . ( But Father killed Mother ? ) All rivers flow there . ( ? to save me from someone ? ) All time bends there . ( ? who waits there , calling , calling ? ) All life ends there . Over and over the rhyme , the need , filling her with a passion she had ver felt before . She knew what it was . No one needed to explain it to ber . The Cranning call .  | They spent no time at all in the Cuts . Though Patience was fascinated by the glittering clothing and everyone 's passionate urgency to spend themselves all in one night , Sken led her at once to a small riverboat , the kind with a mast to help upstream when the wind was good , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a need . The heavy oars explained why the fat woman 's arms were thick and muscular . Patience began to suspect , as Sken pulled them away from the island , that there was less fat on her than she had supposed at first . " We wait out here in the dark , " Sken whispered , " until his boat comes . Then we go back in and get him . " It was only a few minutes later ; this early in the evening , there was a lot of traffic from Kingsport up the Glad River to the Cuts . Angel 's disguise was good enough that Sken recognized him before Patience did . She was looking for an aging scholar , or the gracious old woman he sometimes had mimicked in the past . Instead , he was an obvious male whore , slightly drunk , painted till his face fairly glowed in the torchlight . " I thought the essence of disguise was to be inconspicuous , " Patience said . The oars dipped into the water without a splash  --  Sken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without seeming to strain .  | " The essence of disguise is to be unnoticed , " said Angel . He dipped his hands into the river to wash his face . " You can do that by being so nondescript that no one notices you , or being so embarrassing that no one can stand to look at you . Either way , your disguise remains unexamined , and so you remain unrecognized . " " Why did you leave me in the tonguing booths all day ? " Patience said . She did n't like it when Angel proved that he still knew more than she did . " Where were you yesterday , little fool , when I stood there in the School with my face hanging out for any of the King 's asses to see me ? " " Talk softer , " Sken whispered . " The King 's patrol are known to anchor their boats on the river and listen in the darkness for fools who think they 're alone . " They fell silent then . They passed the eastern edge of Cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses perched precariously high above the water . It was a district called Stilts  --  the town of the river people , who it was said were born and died without ever setting foot on land . It was n't true , of course , but they did spend most of their lives on the water . The story was they got seasick on land . If they had liquor in them , they could n't even walk unless there was a shifting deck under them . Patience had always suspected they made up the stories themselves . " At high tide , " said Sken , " the water comes up to there . " She pointed to a level on the nearest piling about a meter above the water . " But in spring flood , there are weeks when we live in the attics , because the water on the first floor is three feet deep . " Patience marveled at that  --  the houses were all a good four meters above the water level . The land on the left bank , where the new town was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring . But the marshland of the right bank must be under water for a good long time . Patience began to understand how the river controlled the way human beings lived here . Korfu had risen and fallen many times in seven thousand years . Heptam had been a provincial town and the center of the world . Yet in all that time , the river still worked its will in this place . As if he read her thoughts , Angel said , " There was a levee on the right bank for a thousand years , and the marshland was heavily populated . But about five thousand years ago it was breached and no one rebuilt it . Within fifty years it was as if it had never been there . Time is against us . " The boat bumped up against a large piling . A house was built on this  | single massive stilt , with stabilizing boards angling off to triangulate with the great beams . " Here , " said Sken . She tied the boat to the piling and climbed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of irregular ladder into the house . Then , before Patience could walk to that end of the boat to climb up , a net dropped down like a heavy spider . " She 's going to lift us up ? " asked Patience . " I brought some luggage with me , " said Angel . Patience recognized his small trunk . Of course . Her things he could leave somewhere in hiding , but his little trunk was never long out of his sight . She knew he kept his disguises in it , but there were other things , too , which he showed to no one . The trunk rose quickly upward into the house . Then Angel motioned for Patience to climb . The house swayed slightly when they walked from one end to another . To someone who lived on the river , it probably felt fine , but to Patience it was unnerving . It was like living in a constant earthquake , she thought . And when Sken moved from place to place , her great mass tilted it even more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " I 'm sorry I did n't meet you on time , " Patience said . " I had some questions I had to ask Father . Questions I could only ask him when he was dead . " " I guessed as much , " said Angel . " Did you leave him there when you were through ? " " Oruc had enough use of him when he was alive , " said Patience . " He 'll have no use of him now . " Sken was horrified . " You killed your father 's head ? " " Shut up and tend to the food , " Angel said softly . Sken glowered but obeyed . " He asked me to , " said Patience . " As any sane man would , " said Angel . " Just because we can preserve them does n't mean we should . Just one more abomination we 'll have to answer for someday . " " To God ? I do n't think he cares what we do with our heads . " Sken could n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasphemers I would have put you at the bottom of the river . " It was Patience who answered this time . " And if I 'd known you were unable to keep your mouth still I would have left your head in the privy hole . " Angel smiled . " So you did have your loop on you ? "  | " I needed it twice . I was n't very subtle , either . " " God knows , " muttered Sken . " Well , what did your father tell you ? " Patience looked at him coldly . " He told me what he said you were going to tell me . " " What is that ? " " Tell me what you 're supposed to tell me , and I 'll see if it agrees . " " Patience , I know more games than I ever taught you . If you tell me what secrets he told you , then I do n't have to go on lying to you for the next thirty years . " " Did you know about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see you did n't ask him easy questions . " " He broke in two hours . I thought he had more strength than that . " " He had more strength than anyone . " " He whined and whimpered  --  and when the worms punished him , he even wept . " Angel nodded gravely . " Of course . " " What do you mean , of course ! He was the one who taught me endurance , who taught me that the emotion I showed should never be the emotion I felt , and there he was ? " She stopped , feeling stupid . " Yes ? " asked Angel . " There he was , showing emotions and I fell for it . " " Ah . So perhaps he did n't break at all . " " He was n't lying to me . I saw when he was lying , and I saw when he stopped . He ca n't hide everything . Can he ? " " No . I think he told you the truth . What else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enough ? " " The prophecy ? " " I knew a little about that anyway . He told me what the Starship Captain did with his left hand . " " Angel , I 've decided where I want to go . " " Your father left me strict instructions . " " My father is dead now , and you belong to me . " Sken was surprised . " You mean you 're a slave ? I 've been taking orders from a slave ? " " I am the slave of a Slave of the King . That puts me so far above you that you 're unworthy to inhale one of my farts . Now will you shut up , woman ? "  | Actually , thought Patience , I 'm the Heptarch now . You 're Slave to the King herself . Her only Slave . Much may it profit you . " So , " said Angel . " Where do you want to go ? " " Cranning , " said Patience . Angel was angry , though he answered with humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . " Now Sken was livid . " Girl ! Girl ! You mean this snip of a boy is a female ? It is an abomination for the woman to wear the clothing of the man , and the man to wear the clothing of a woman ? " " Shall I kill her to get us some silence ? " Angel asked . Sken fell silent , stuffing hardbread into sacks and spiced sausages into watertight pouches . " Child , " said Angel , " that is the one place you can never go . " " I 'm sure of it , " she said . " But it 's the one place I have to go . I was born for it , do n't you see ? " " You were born for something better than to go off fulfilling mad prophecies . " " How will you stop me . Kill me ? Because it 's the only way you ever will . " " It 's the Cranning call . That 's what makes you want to go . It comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no reason at all , against all reason ? " " Do n't you think I know ? " Angel chewed on that for a moment . " So you think that whatever it is , you 're stronger . " " I think that if it can call the wisest men out of the world and force my mother to want to sacrifice her daughter , then someone needs to stop it . Why not me ? Do n't the prophecies say that mankind will be reborn ? " " When Kristos comes , " muttered Sken . " The prophets were given their visions and prophecies by whatever it is that calls , " said Angel . " They might be lies , to entice you . " " Then I 'm enticed . If you 're so wise , Angel , why have n't you felt the Cranning call ? " Angel went cold , his face a hard-set mask . She had always had the gift of goading him . " No one ever proved that every wise one heard the call . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks on a man whose honest words she would need again and again . So she smiled and touched his hand . " Angel , you spent your life making me as wise and dangerous as possible . When will I be readier ? When you 're too old  | to come with me ? When I 've fallen in love with some cod and had three babies that I have to protect ? " " Maybe you 'll never be ready for whatever waits . " " Or maybe now . When I 'm willing to die . When I 've lost my father for the first time and my mother all over again . Now , when I 'm willing to kill because of the rage that burns in me for what has been stolen from me and my father and my mother , now is the time for me to face whatever waits for me there . With you or without you , Angel . But better with you . " Angel smiled . " All right . " Patience glared at him . " That was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Come now , Patience . Your father warned us both that the worst thing in the world was waiting in Cranning . As well as we knew him , and as well as he knew us , do n't you think he knew we 'd come to this moment ? " Patience remembered her father 's head . Was he scheming even then , letting her force from him the very truths that he most wanted to tell her ? " I do n't care if he was , " she said . " Even if my father really wanted me to go , I 'll go . " " Good . Tonight then . We do n't want another day here . " He took a purse from his belt and took out two large steel coins . " Sken , do you know what these are worth ? " " If they 're real , then you 're a damned fool for carrying them without a bodyguard . " " Are they enough to buy your boat ? " Sken squinted at him . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they are steel . " He tossed them to her . She bit them and weighed them in her hand . " I 'm not a fool , " she said . " You are if you think they are n't real , " said Angel . " I wo n't sell you the boat unless you buy me , too . " " Buy you ! That 's enough to buy your silence , and that 's all we want of you . " " I said I 'm not a fool . This is n't the price a man offers for a boat if he means to leave the money behind . You plan to kill me before you go . " " If I say I 'm buying , I 'm buying . " " You 've let me hear enough tonight that you dare n't let me live behind you . A girl traveling in disguise with a man who tosses steel about as if it were silver ? Her father recently dead , and them both afraid of the law ? Do you think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died today ? And that the King looks for his daughter Patience , the rightful Heptarch , the daughter of prophecy ? You did n't care if I figured it out because you knew I 'd be dead . " Patience knew Sken was right  --  she knew Angel well enough for that . " I thought you were talking so openly because this woman was to be trusted , not because she was to die . " " And what if you 're right ? " asked Angel . " What if I did mean to kill you ? Why should I change my mind now , and take you along ? " " Because I know the river and I 'm strong enough to row . " " We can hire a rower if we feel the need . " " Because you 're both decent folk who do n't kill people who do n't deserve it . " " We 're not that decent , " said Angel . " We leave justice up to the priests . " " You 'll take me along because she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of my life . I 'd die before I let any harm come to her . " The fervency of Sken 's speech was convincing . Schooled in guile , they knew naivete when they saw it . Sken had n't the art to lie to them even if she wanted to . " Well ? " asked Angel . Patience was willing . Sken 's loyalty appealed to her . It had n't occurred to her until now that she might have more friends with her identity revealed than she could ever have in disguise . " I almost cut off her head before . It 's the least we can do now . " " Until we have no more need of you , then , " said Angel . " And your parting wages will be a good deal better than death . " " What about these coins ? " " Keep them , " said Angel . " They 're an earnest of rewards to come . " It took only a few minutes to load the boat . They sang ribald songs together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed the guards by name . They knew her well , and let her pass . They rounded a bend and passed into the forest , where the river ran cool and deep . Heptam was behind them , and they had begun the long road to Cranning.  | Patience did not enjoy the river travel . Not that the water made her sick ? she had crossed seawater often enough between King 's Hill and Lost Souls ' Island that the river seemed calm . There were many things that contributed to her malaise . The death of her father , the loss of all that was familiar to her , and , on top of that , the ever-present Cranning call , urging her on ; she felt she had lost control of things , and it made her anxious . What made it worse was that she had genuine physical discomfort as well . Sken and Angel were frank enough about handling the elimination of waste ; they hung over the gunnel and everyone discreetly looked away . But Patience had swallowed the scepter of the Heptarchs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of the River Glad . So she could only relieve her bowel on land , and they did n't stop every day , or even every other day . And when they did , she took no pleasure in searching for the crystal . Many times she wished it had been smaller , or that she had n't swallowed it . Since no one searched her , it had n't been necessary after all , and now all this annoyance was for nothing . But she found it at last , and tucked it safely away , hoping she would  | never have to resort to her own alimentary system as a hiding place again . They left the Glad River at Wanwood , where it bent north and west . They bought a half-open carriage with four horses ; they would n't need to keep out the cold , only the rain . The roads alternated between ruts and mudholes , depending on the weather . On the worst roads , Sken climbed off the carriage and walked . " I thought you were well enough padded to withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This is all meat , and tender as veal today , after this pounding . " No doubt they seemed an odd family , if anyone on the road took them for father , mother , and son . Patience , still disguised as a boy , publicly referred to Angel and Sken as uncle and aunt , which annoyed them both . But on the highway , few people commented on oddities , not to their faces , anyway ; and their money won them admirers wherever they went . The roads were not as safe as the river , not for travelers without armed escort . They were careful to stop for the night well before dusk , and in every inn they stayed at , the three of them shared a room . More than once Angel had to persuade burglars to abandon their life of crime . Removing a few fingers usually did the trick . At last they reached Cranwater , the great river that flowed from Skyfoot in a single stream to the sea . They reached it at Waterkeep , an ancient castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle was in ruins and the city had shrunk to a fair-sized market town . Two dozen inns and taverns , what with the intersection of the river and the road . They chose an inn and stabled the horses . At supper , with bread and cheese and pea soup at the tavern table , and Sken 's mug filled with warm ale , Angel and Patience discussed their plans for the morning . " It 's time we left the road , " said Angel . " The river is here , our highway northward . " " The river 's narrow here , " said Sken . " The current 's strong . I 'd need two strong men to help me row against it . " Angel had already thought of that . " The prevailing wind in these latitudes at this time of year is from the west , and usually the southwest . " " You 're going to buy a windsucker ? " asked Sken . " Do you know how to pilot one ? " " I was wrapped in sailcloth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long  | before I settled me on the river with my second husband , my family was a seafaring family . Left our stilts every spring with the floods and a cargo of such stuff as Heptam makes , then home again before summer with the earliest fruits from the islands . Never got rich , as I recall it , but we got drunk a lot . " " Then you know how to handle a sailing vessel . " " Never done it on a river this narrow . But no reason it ca n't be done . Just have to do things faster , that 's all . Do n't buy too big a boat , that 's all . You 'd better let me choose it , too . " " Is that all ? " " That 's all . Are you two made of money ? " A dwelf stood by their table with a pitcher of ale . " More ? " he asked . " No , " said Angel . " Yes , " said Sken , glaring at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelf . He had Sken 's intonation exactly . " Now look what you 've done , " said Angel . " We 'll have the dwelf repeating it all over the tavern . " " Repeat repeat , " said the dwelf . Then he giggled . Angel put a couple of coppers in his hand , turned him around , and pushed him toward the kitchen . " Sorry , " said Sken . " Even if dwelfs have no brains , they still have ears , and they can repeat anything . " Angel let his annoyance show . It could be intimidating , and Sken was silent . " Dwelfs are a puzzle , " said Patience . " They do have their own language . They must have some kind of brain , to hold a language . " Angel shrugged . " I never ponder the mental capacity of dwelfs . I just think of them as exceptionally stupid geblings . " " But they are n't geblings , are they ? " " Another indigenous species . Imakulata needed humans , whether the geblings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The innkeeper came out of the kitchen carrying bread to another table . But when that job was done , he came over and pulled up a chair beside Angel . " Everything is excellent , " said Sken . She was beginning to be drunk . " Everything is perfect . More ale , please . " The innkeeper was not amused . " I do n't know where you people are from  --  probably Heptam , since you seem to think nothing can harm you . " " There are plenty of things that can harm us in Heptam , " said Angel .  | " There is n't a tavern in Waterkeep where you can safely show as much money as you 've shown , and talk as freely . I hope you are n't planning to travel from here by road . " " Should n't we ? " asked Angel . " Better hire a trustworthy guard . Preferably by arranging with the townmaster for some of the local police . Otherwise you wo n't get ten miles from here alive . " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that all ? " " All ? There 's plenty of trade through here , and not much protection . Officially we 're part of Pankos , but we have n't seen a royal officer in thirty years . So the townmaster makes the law in Waterkeep , and Tinker makes the law in the woods . " " Tinker ? " " He used to be a royal governor , or maybe just a royal governor 's son . They say he was caught sleeping in the wrong bed . That was fifteen years ago . He lives in the forest north of here . They say he has a whole city of robbers living in treehouses . We call it Tinker 's Wood . " " Sounds like children playing , " said Angel . " If you go south or east or west they 'll stop you , and as long as you give them everything you own without a fight , they 'll usually let you keep your clothes and your lives . If you have enough money , even your horses and carriage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take an army . A very large one . Or go by boat . Tinker figures anyone headed north by road has decided to die . And he believes that death can be a long and satisfying spectator sport . " " You 've convinced us , " said Angel . " And thank you for taking the risk of angering him , by warning us . " " Oh , he does n't mind if we warn people . There 's always plenty of fools who figure if they buy a few extra arrows they can go where they like . " " I can go anywhere , " mumbled Sken . " I 'll cut em in half , every last bastard of em . " " Go by boat , " said the innkeeper . " And do n't go anywhere near shore for at least thirty miles upriver . It 's good advice . People who take it live to thank me . " The innkeeper went back to the kitchen . " Back to the water , " said Sken . " About time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloshed ale on Angel . They enlisted the help of the four household dwelfs to get her to her room . On the dock the next morning they found a good many boats for hire , but not many for sale . " Does n't matter , " murmured Angel . " Any boat is for sale when the price is high enough . " " Our money is n't infinite , " said Patience . " We may want some next year . " " Do you want to get to Cranning or not ? " Yes , she wanted to get to Cranning . Wanted to more than anything else in the world . The Cranning call was with her now as a constant hunger . As long as she was moving toward Cranning , it eased , and she felt satisfied . But when there were delays , like now , as they walked on the wooden wharf of the riverport , the need became quite intense . Today , though , she noticed a subtle change . It was n't just that she needed to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , to travel up the river . The morning sunlight dancing on the water looked magical , the curve of the river enticed her . And it occurred to her that she had never felt such feelings before . She had n't particularly enjoyed the journey on the Glad River . Why should she long for waterborne travel now ? She thought of last night , when the innkeeper had come to them . Perhaps he advised everyone to avoid Tinker 's Wood , but she doubted it . The people of Waterkeep had to have some working arrangement with the local highwaymen , especially since they had no protection from a larger government . If the innkeeper was free to warn away travelers , then the robbers must not be very dangerous after all . And if the robbers were as dangerous as he had said , then how did he dare to risk his life to warn a trio of rich and foolish strangers away from the road ? What could it be but the Cranning call , prompting the innkeeper and now making her long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  wanted her not to travel on the forest road . Was it simply to keep her safe ? Or was it because there was something in that forest , along that road , that she must not discover ? Am I not a trained killer ? And Angel ? Sken , too , looks like she could be dangerous enough . Even if the robbers are as vicious as the innkeeper said , we could probably get through . And if Unwyrm wants us not to go that way , then that is the way I will go . In the moment she made that decision , she felt an agony of regret . How could she even have thought of doing such a stupid thing ? Risking  | the lives of all three of them on some stupid whim . When the water looked so inviting , was so easy , just to sail upriver And now she knew , through the cloud of these passions , that Unwyrm wanted desperately for her to stay off the forest road . She also knew that regardless of the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Cranning and for the river only got worse , but had n't she been schooled all her life in putting off her ease ? Had n't she gone without sleep , without food , without water , in order to stretch her limits , to toughen her resistance ? She could ignore any of her body 's hungers , especially when she knew that it was an illusion sent into her mind by an enemy . Or was it an enemy ? It did n't matter . She was determined not to succumb to the Cranning call in every particular . She would go to Cranning , but she would take any route she pleased . She would not be controlled . " This one , " said Sken . The boat was small , compared to some of the sailing vessels , but it looked clean and sturdy . " All right , " said Angel . " No , " said Patience . Sken was annoyed . " What 's wrong with it ? " " Nothing . Except that I 'm not going by boat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your mind ? " he whispered . " Probably . But I 'm not going by boat . I 'm taking our carriage through the forest road . " " It 's suicide . Did n't you hear the innkeeper ? " " I heard him very well . I also hear the Cranning call . He wants me to go by water . Wants it badly . I 'm going to find out what it is that he does n't want me to find in the forest . " " Death , that 's what he does n't want you to find . " " Are you sure ? I think he 's a little too eager to get us off the road . This is n't the best place to begin a sailing voyage upriver  --  the current 's too swift . Sken said so herself , did n't she ? " " It 's better than dying . " " Since when have you been afraid of a few highwaymen , Angel ? " " Since I thought of dozens of them dropping out of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in subtle ways , not fight with a bunch of unmannered thieves . " " You have n't met them . You know nothing about their manners . " " Did it occur to you that maybe this is just what Unwyrm wants you  | to do ? Maybe the creature knows that you 're stubborn and rebellious . Maybe it wants you to go into the forest , and figured this was the way . " " A little far-fetched , Angel . " " Maybe it wants the robbers to get rid of your traveling companions . " He was as much as confessing that he feared for his own life . The Cranning call resonated with his words . The feelings welled up in her . How can you endanger them ? What kind of person are you ? Selfish , arrogant . Go by water , for their sake . But the more the Cranning call pressed her , the more she resisted . " Go by boat , then . I 'll meet you in the first riverport village upstream . I can handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I trust you . " No , " said Angel . His hands were trembling . " No , I wo n't leave you . " He really is afraid , thought Patience . Almost she decided to give in , for Angel 's sake . But the moment she thought that , the Cranning call redoubled its force , as if her thought of yielding had opened a floodgate . She winced from the pain of it . Then the longing subsided , as if it had taken a great effort from Unwyrm to call her with such power . Good , thought Patience . Wear yourself out with trying . I did n't go without comfort all that time in my childhood just to give in and take the easy way now . " Good . We go by land . " Sken was no happier than Angel had been . " You do n't have to come with me , " Patience said . " You 've served me well and earned your passage home . " " We need all the help we can get , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you come with us . " Sken looked at him with contempt . " I 'll come because of who she is , not what you offer . " Angel smiled . Patience knew perfectly well that Angel had expected Sken to react that way . The art of diplomacy , as Father had always said : to provoke your opponent into wanting to do what you planned . Angel was a diplomat . Unwyrm was n't . Unwyrm was very blunt about what he wanted , and Patience was just as blunt about rejecting him . There was no subtle byplay in this battle . They left the dock and went to the stable . Their horses had been well groomed  --  Angel had paid for the service , since he was expecting to sell them . Patience prepared her blowgun with three dozen wooden darts . They  | were more visible than her glass darts , but they flew farther and carried as lethal a dose of poison . Angel grumbled about being an old man as he took a shortbow and a packet of arrows from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " he said . " I 'm better with knifework in close . " " From behind , too , no doubt , " said Sken . " I can poison them all , too , " said Angel . " Provided they invite us to supper . " " Poison and a knife in the back . What a man . " " Enough , " said Patience . " This will be dangerous enough without a stupid quarrel over nothing . " She spoke sharply , letting her voice carry away some of the ever-increasing punishment the Cranning call was inflicting on her . Just climbing into the carriage made her feel ill ; she was trembling and nauseated as Angel snapped the reins to start the horses out onto the cobbled lane . The stones were ancient and worn even and flat by years of traffic , but Patience felt the tiny breaks between them like ruts that jarred her until her head ached . But she had learned all her lessons well . She kept her demeanor calm , managing to look slightly amused at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break under Unwyrm 's twisting grip . She would not let Angel see that she suffered . If she could fool Angel , she knew she was still in control of herself . The town was not very big , and soon the highway passed between fields of vegetables and orchards , where farmers hoed or harvested among the ruins of old mansions that had once been the pride of Waterkeep . It was part of the cycle of things , in the years of human life on Imakulata . Waterkeep had once been great ; it would be great again , or it would disappear entirely , but nothing stayed . Even the religions had their changing fashions , the Keepers and the Brickmakers , the Rememberers and the Watchers , and , only in the last century , the Vigilante in their little hermit huts . They would also fall to ruin . Nothing lasted . Except the bloodline of the Heptarchy , which had gone on unbroken , the only institution that endured through all the millennia of mankind on Imakulata . It was a thing unknown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Romans were only a thousand years by the most generous count ; the Popes only lasted some 2500 years . Even the patriarchate of Constantinople was gone now , though it had lasted long enough in a perverse and polluted form to send this colony to Imakulata . The colonists on Imakulata were supposed to keep Greek religion alive , though none of them spoke Greek or cared much ,  | in the end , about maintaining the forms of the old Greek church . Nothing lasted except the Heptarchy . Until now , thought Patience . Now this distant being , this enemy , this Unwyrm tears at me . It is the end of the Heptarchy if he conquers me . And if I keep resisting him , it is the end of me . Orchards began to give way to stands of wood . Here and there a tiny village interrupted the growing forest , with a few cows on the cornmons , a few farmers in the fields , and children who shouted at the carriage and ran alongside until they could n't keep up any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Patience pretended to enjoy it , though she was beyond anything but the imitation of pleasure now . Angel , however , stayed glum , urging the horses on at a brisk pace . Finally , in early afternoon , the trees won out entirely , as the road became closed in with thick underbrush and old giants ten or twenty meters round . It was a perfect place for ambuscade , and Patience felt a new wave of shame at having led them into such danger . They came to a long straight lane through the densest part of the woods . At the far end of the lane they could plainly see a thick rope stretched across the road , at such a height that it would catch the horses ' necks . " Brazen , are n't they ? " said Sken . " They give us plenty of time to see what 's coming . " " I 'm turning around , " said Angel . At his words Patience felt grateful assent well up within her . But she had learned discipline . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as the pain of it became greater . " Go back if you want , " she said . " I 'm going on . " She had her glass blowgun in the cross beneath her shirt ; it and the loop were her weapons of last resort if she were captured . She carried a longer , more accurate wooden blowgun . The darts , all heavily poisoned , were in a pouch . She could handle them safely enough ; her father had seen to it she was inured to the most useful poisons before she was ten years old . She swung down from the carriage and strode out boldly toward the waiting rope . ur Sken cursed , but followed her with a hatchet in each hand . And Angel grimly brought the carriage along after . " They can kill us whenever they want , " he said . " Watch the trees , " said Patience . " The innkeeper said they liked torturing people . They 'll try to take us alive . " 1 , " Now I feel better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Patience . uhi  | " It 's as good as down . " Patience scanned the underbrush , the trees overhead . The leaves were sparse enough to allow plenty of light ; there was a slight breeze , too , which concealed any signs of movement by the robbers . Patience saw only a couple of men high in the branches . Bowmen , no doubt . But it was not an easy thing to aim a bow to shoot almost straight down at a moving target ; if the archers in the trees hit any of them , it would be more by chance than design . What worried her were the men on the ground , no doubt dozens of them hiding behind trees . They could swarm out from any direction . She slipped a dart into the blowgun and held three in her right hand . They were still a few meters from the rope when four men stepped out from behind a tree and stood in the middle of the road , behind the rope . They swaggered , they smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , preparing to speak . Patience knew that as he talked , others would come out and surround them . So there would be no talk . She blew a puff through the pipe . She had aimed for the throat , but the dart went high and entered his mouth . He stood , transfixed , the dart invisible to his companions behind him . So she had time to load again and shook before they realized what was happening . The second dart struck its victim in the forehead ; the first man finally gagged and choked and fell over , writhing from the poison that was already reaching his brain . The other two men backed away , surprised for a moment that the initiative had been taken from them . Sken moved slowly , but with great momentum , and one blow with her hatchet split the rope . Immediately Angel urged the horses forward , Sken swung up onto the carriage , and Patience jogged alongside , then caught hold . The carriage bounced over the bodies in the road . She heard a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his mouth . " For a moment it seemed they might be allowed to pass . Then the men began to shout , to scream , and arrows began striking the carriage from behind . Angel urged the horses on , shouted at them , and then suddenly gurgled and choked . An arrow stuck out of the side of his neck . Many hands clutched at the horses ; the carriage came to a stop . Patience had no time to worry about Angel . Fortunately the robbers wasted time cutting the horses loose . Patience ignored the horses and shouted for Sken to do the same . Sken took the left side of the carriage , swinging her hatchets and spattering blood in every direction . They backed off from Sken , perhaps hoping an archer would take care of her , but Patience kept blowing darts with deadly aim  --  at this range , she  | could hardly miss  --  and those who were n't killed outright screamed in such agony at the poison that the robbers began to lose heart . After all , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen men , with some vicious injuries from the hatchets , and every dart that hit home meant another death . They cried out terrible threats and oaths , but broke and ran as the darts kept coming . Sken had a deep cut in the back of one arm . " I 'm all right , " she said . " We 've got to get out of here . They 'll be back , they 'll follow us , we 've got to keep moving . " " Can you pull the carriage ? " " Better to run , what good will all your money do you if you 're dead ? " " Angel 's still alive . The only way to bring him is in the carriage . " Sken looked at the arrow in his throat , grunted , then took her place at the front of the carriage . " Just keep a good lookout , " she said . Angel 's wound was n't bleeding much , and Patience knew to leave the shaft in place until they had time to try surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert physician , though , there was n't much hope for him . She should go back , hurry back to Waterkeep , where there would be a physician . And they could continue their trip by water , after Angel was better . But she recognized this thought , too , as coming from Unwyrm . Or did she ? Maybe it was common sense , maybe what she was doing with this determination to resist was killing Angel . How could she push on , not even knowing if there was a village ahead , when this loyal man , her teacher , virtually the only father she had ever really known , lay dying in the carriage ? On . She held that single thought in her head , go on . Go on . She scanned the road ahead and behind , watching for robbers or for one of the horses . Once a man stepped into the road behind them , armed with a bow ; he died before he could get off a shot . There were no others . Perhaps they had given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could be no slackening of the pace . She tried to join Sken in pulling the carriage . " Go away , " said the woman . " You break up my rhythm . Keep watching . " And finally the trees thinned , and there was an orchard , and after the orchard , a field ; villagers shouted to each other and began to gather . " Tinker let you through ? " asked a child . " Have you a healer ! " called Sken . " Not a village healer , " Patience said .  | " They sometimes know more than the town physicians , " she answered . " And if they have one , so much the better for the old man . " " We have a healer , " said a man . " A gebling . But a fine healer all the same . " " Can you pull this carriage ? " asked Sken . " Can you pull this to the healer ? We can pay . " " Tinker left you with money ? " Patience was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Take us to the healer . " " The boy 's a pretty one , " said one of the girls , a snaggle-toothed wretch who was trying to flirt . Patience sighed and climbed onto the carriage . Angel 's eyes were open now . She held his hand to ease the fear he no doubt felt . " We 're with friends , " she said . The villagers took hold of the carriage leads , and some pushed from behind . Sken gratefully climbed aboard . A strange feeling came over Patience as soon as the carriage started to move again , a feeling of sweetness , of peace . All the resistance from Unwyrm was gone . And now the Cranning call was back again , a yearning to go on , to go north , to Cranning . Where her lover waited for her , with gentleness and tender kisses , her lover waited to fill her womb with life . Patience forced these new feelings into the background , just as she had done with the old , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So apparently I 'm right where he did n't want me to be . Heading for a gebling healer in a village hidden from the world by a band of robbers . Unwyrm could n't have guided her here more surely if he had given her a map . Have I done , after all , what my enemy wanted ? Or have I defeated him ? " There , " cried some of the villagers . It was a good-sized house at the far end of town . " He lives there with his sister , " said a villager . " And a human , a giant . " " They say the geblings sleep together , " said another . " Filthy beasts . " " But he 's a healer , a true healer . " " What is his name ? " asked Patience . " Ruin , " said a man . Sken snorted . " That 's a promising name . " Smoke curled from the chimney . Pass it by , said the Cranning call . Hurry on . Angel will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by . The door opened and a gebling woman emerged , covered with fur . She was clean , not filthy at all , beautiful by gebling standards . There was an intelligence in her eyes that made Patience decide to be wary  | with her . No sense in letting her know that she could speak Geblic . This house was important enough that Unwyrm did n't want her there . So she would enter it as an ambassador , and learn all she could before committing herself to anything . And in the meantime , she hoped against all likelihood that Angel could be saved . Blood oozed from the arrow 's root as the villagers carried him in . Patience thought of scattering copper coins for them , but instead took a steel coin and handed it to the old man who seemed to be the village headman . " For the whole village , for your kindness to us . " The old man smiled and nodded , and people murmured their thanks . It was more money than the whole village earned in a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still well away from her little house . There was an excitement in the murmur that the wind brought . She cocked her head to hear better . Could it be a gobbing ? No , there was no anger in it . This was n't a village that was given to letting the priests stir them up against the geblings . Which was not to say that it was n't always a possibility . One never knew when humans would get religion and start killing . But why the excitement , if they were coming for a healing ? Someone important needed physicking , then , someone unusual or powerful . A stranger , of course , since no one unusual or powerful had ever lived anywhere near Waterside Village  --  one of a hundred villages by that name along the shores of Cranwater alone . The stranger must also be injured , not sick , for disease never drew a crowd for long . Fear of contagion . Reck went to the door and called to Will . He was in the field , hoeing out the potatoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sledge and pulled the heavy burden along the ground toward the barn . He was a tall man , a giant even by human standards ; to a gebling he was almost double size . He had once been an owned soldier , a slave in the service of  | a general officer in one army or another . He was an accomplished killer , and stronger than any other man Reck had heard of . But Reck had no fear of him . She had found him as a runaway slave many years ago and offered him protection and a place to farm . It was enough for him . He and Reck made a pleasant enough life of it . Neither said much to the other , because neither had much to say . Both did their work dependably and well , and took pleasure in the labor . Still , they were wise enough to be discreet . After all these years it was no secret in the village that there was a giant man living with the geblings near the forest 's edge . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept Will out of sight when people brought their sick and injured to be healed . It was not a problem with them . Will got the sledge in the barn and no doubt climbed into the loft to sleep until the people went away . Will had a remarkable ability to sleep whenever he wanted , for as long as he wanted . Reck often wondered if Will was ever haunted by the dreams that kept her sleepless so many nights . She wondered , but did not ask . Dreams were not a subject that a gracious gebling asked about . She saw the people drawing a carriage toward her house . No horses . That meant that the owners of the carriage had fallen afoul of the robbers  --  Tinker 's men , no doubt . That was no surprise . The surprise was that anyone came out of it alive . Tinker was usually more careful . She sniffed the air . Blood , but no bowel smell . Perhaps only a superficial wound , something she could clean and bind up without waiting for her brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage , sitting up and conversing with the villagers . He seemed to be in charge of things . An old man lay with his head in the boy 's lap . A coarse-looking fat woman rode in the driver 's seat , calling to the villagers who drew the carriage , urging them on with curses and promises and taunts . It was the old man who was injured , then . Only the one ? And a young boy like that  --  Tinker always had his eye out for a catamite . Something strange had passed in the forest . Unlikely that Tinker was alive , with an outcome such as this . Whatever they were , they must be more formidable than they looked at first . That was all right ; Reck understood that . She , too , was more formidable than she seemed . She met them at the gate . " Carry the man in , if he ca n't walk , " she said . " Leave the carriage there , and the rest of you go home . " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And half his men . " The fat woman was feeling boastful . " I killed half of em myself , and  | you can trust there was a mark or two on every one ! " Could be bluster , but no . Reck saw bloodstains halfway up her arms . Some of the blood was her own . " You can wash in the basin outside here . Get that wound clean . " The fat woman washed as the villagers brought in the old man and laid him on the physicking table . The boy and the fat woman came in to watch ; Reck paid no attention to them . The man had an arrow in his throat , lodged well in . It had passed behind the windpipe , so he had pain but no blood in his breath . Blood was still welling slowly from the base of the wound . Reck leaned down and sniffed it , then put forth her long tongue to lick it . She heard the fat woman grunt in revulsion . The boy said nothing . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't place it . More important was the taste of the old man 's blood . " Poison , " Reck told them . " A nasty one . This wound wo n't heal . The blood wo n't stop flowing . " " Then we do n't take the arrow out ? " asked the fat woman . " You were right to leave it in . " " What will you do ? " asked the boy . " Nothing . " Reck turned to the villagers . " Go away , I told you . You 've done all you can ! " " You 'll do nothing ! " said the boy . " Then we 'll go on to the next village , thank you . " The boy spoke in a voice that said that he expected to be obeyed . Hum , the blacksmith 's boy , answered on the way out the door . " Oh , this one 's the girl goblin . It 's the brother that 's the healer . " " A girl ! " cried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goblins ? " " When you see the brother , you 'll know . He 's got him a tine this long . Never wears nothing but his fur . " Reck was used to the way humans ridiculed geblings to their faces . If geblings had been larger than two-thirds the average human height , they might have refused to bear it . But as long as geblings wanted to live away from Cranning , out in the world of men , they had to accommodate the empty-minded cruelty of humans . Her brother , Ruin , had a harder time bearing it than most . He lived in the woods most of the time , to get away from them , and refused to wear clothing at all , as if to say that he 'd rather be the animal they thought he was than pretend to be like them . " When will your brother come back ? " asked the boy . Reck did n't answer the question . Instead she studied the boy 's face , then sniffed the air again . That 's what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the eyes , like most human males . And there was the smell of menstrual blood on him ; the living blood from the old man 's wound had masked it . But there was no lying to Reck 's nose . The door closed behind the last of the villagers . " I said , when will your brother come back ? " " First , " said Reck , " tell me who you are , and why you 're pretending to be a boy . " Suddenly she felt a strong hand gripping her wrist , twisting her around . It was the old man . She had thought him unconscious , but now he held her like the jaws of a purweck . She might have hit him in the groin and made him let go , but she saw no reason to add to the pain he already had . " You can fool humans , " she said , " but not a gebling with half a brain . What the eye ca n't see , the nose can smell . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my time of month , remember ? I forgot that geblings could smell it . It 's a gift I wish I had . " The old man 's grip relaxed . Reck did not move until he pulled his hand away . " The old man 's name is Angel . He 's my tutor and my friend . This magnificent woman is Sken . She included herself with the purchase price when we bought her boat to leave Heptam . " The girl smiled . " I was going to tell you my name was Adam , but now that you know my sex , I wo n't tell you my name at all . " " How do you propose to pay us , if Tinker robbed you ? " " Tinker did n't rob us . He only proposed to rob us . His men ran our horses off , but we gave them more than they expected . We thought to buy more horses here . But it seems no one has horses to sell . " " The army takes them , " Reck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for farming . Geblings get no horse at all . " " I do n't want your horse . I just want Angel healed . " " My brother is coming . " " You have n't even sent for him . " " I do n't have to send for him . He knows the animals of the forest . They see all that happens here , and tell him . " The girl looked over at Sken , as if to say , What kind of superstitious nonsense have we got caught up in here ? The old man murmured , " We are n't villagers . We know that geblings can call each other . You do n't have to tell animal stories to us . " " It 's the animals of the forest , " Reck said . " But I learned long ago never to argue with a man who thinks he 's a scientist . " " I 'm a philosopher . This arrow in my throat hurts like bloody hell . " ICI  | " I 'm sorry . My brother may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's nothing we can do . " " I 'm thirsty . " " The arrow may pass right through your swallowing throat . " " It does . " " Then you do n't get a drink , either . " The girl and Sken both sat , then , the girl on a stool and Sken on the floor , leaning against the wall . Reck went back to her work , feathering the arrows she had made yesterday . It was a fine and tedious job , made no easier by the labored , painful breathing of the man on the table . Will came in soon after , carrying water . He did not look at the visitors , except for a glance at the man on the table . He set one bucket of water by the fire , and poured the other into a large jar by the table . Only then did he face the visitors . " Will , " he said , introducing himself . " Sken , " said the fat woman . The girl said nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sken looked from him to Reck and back again . " Abomination , " she said . Will grinned . " I 'm her slave , " he said . Sken relaxed a little . " It 's foul for a gebling to own a man , but as long as she does n't get the pony ride ? " " I 'd say it 's none of your business , " said Reck , " and that you have a strange way of talking when you want this man to live . " " I speak my mind , " said Sken . " Then your mind is manure , " said Reck . Sken took only one step toward her . Both Angel and the girl cried out for her to stop . Will cried out also , but to Reck . Despite the cries , however , it was no sound that stopped Sken . It was the sight of Reck with her bow already in place . Only a moment , and she was ready to put an arrow wherever she wanted . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars to my door , and then accuse me of letting a human mount me . Though if any human ever tried , you 're the only one that might live through it . " Angel spoke weakly from the table . " Forgive this woman . She was raised on the river , and never learned to speak civilly to anyone . " Reck let the bow relax . Sken tugged at the neck of her dress and sat back down , looking into the fire . Goblin-baiting had never brought her  | so close to death before . The gebling merchants that bought river passage in Heptam were meek and never answered back . This was n't the first time Sken had had to revise her understanding of the way the world worked . But she never liked it . Will set about making supper , and Reck resumed her fletchery . Angel breathed ever more shallowly . The girl sat silent in the corner . They remained that way , wordless and wary , until dusk , when Ruin came home .  | Ruin felt the pressure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fairly leaned into it , and grimaced at the pain of moving on . Had there been anyone to see him , he would have looked ridiculous , a naked , filthy , ungroomed gebling struggling to move through flat and grassy meadows in bright sunlight , torturing himself to stagger between trees whose branches easily bent out of his way . But always , whenever Ruin set his face toward Cranning , there was a hurricane of resistance . He was the only gebling of all geblings who could not go home . It was after two grueling days of this  --  pushing forward , stopping to rest , pressing on again  --  that he felt Reck 's call to him . That loving touch that seemed to press like gentle fingers on his spine  --  Ruin had never told her how her call affected him ; no other gebling had such power over him . Especially now , after days of Unwyrm 's shout of rage : The whisper from Reck was unbearable . Ruin stumbled to his knees and wept . Wept in anger  --  furious at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the strength to ignore her call and fight on . But he could not fight on . And after he lay in the grass by the stream for a few minutes or an hour , he crawled to the water and drank , then arose . For a moment he faced Cranningward ; but the thought of an- other step in that direction was more than he could bear . He turned and went the other way . His feet were light under him . He loped through the woods and meadows , covering in minutes the ground that he had struggled through for hours . All the while his sister was like a song in his mind , comforting him , calling him back to her . Calling him , but not calling him home . There was no gebling alive who could call any of their humanlike houses " home . " There was only one home for geblings : The great city in the cliff , the mapless tunnels and delvings that reached a mile deep from the face of Skyfoot . Cranning , a city with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelfs and gaunts but ruled by geblings , for only geblings held within their minds the indelible , unwritable memory of every turn of every tunnel in the place . Every stone in every cavern was familiar , even to geblings like Ruin , who had never set his foot on the stone , never tasted the cold water that flowed through the tunnels from the glacier above , never slept under the arch of darkness that was infinitely more comforting than the sky . Where Reck was , Ruin could be at peace ; but outside Cranning , he could never be at home . And while Unwyrm lived , how could Ruin ever get there ? It was the quandary of his life , ever since he was a child and his mother explained who he was and what he had to do . " You are the most excellent of excellent blood , you and your sister , with the seeds of mastery in your souls . There is nothing you can not learn , nothing you can not do , no thought that can not come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born to be the best answer of the geblings to the terrible hatred of Unwyrm , our only hope to slay him , the two of you . " " Where do I find him ? " asked the child Ruin . " He lives at the heart of Cranning , where the lifeblood flows . He lives in the very womb of the geblings , the viper in our womb , to devour our babies as they are born . " " Then teach me the way to Cranning , Mother , so I can go and kill him ! " Then Mother wept , her long tongue hanging dejectedly from her mouth , its twin points glistening with her tears . " How can you , of all geblings , not already know the way ? Ah , Ruin and Reck , my son , my daughter , we made you to be the downfall of our enemy , but already he knows you and hides Cranning from you in your own mind . " When Mother died , Ruin and Reck wandered aimlessly in the world for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for the work their mother had taught them they must do . Reck learned the arts of archery and could kill anything that she could see  --  but she refused to  | search for Cranning , denying that the place meant anything to her . She mocked Ruin for his endless effort to reach the place . " All dreams and visions , " she said , " all foolish prophecies . " But still she practiced with the bow in all her spare hours , and studied all the lore of Unwyrm that she could find among the geblings who traveled the river and came to take the hospitality of her house . Ruin , in turn , would not become a killer . Instead he learned the arts of healing . He wandered in the woods , testing the herbs that grew there , using them to heal the sick and broken animals , the wounds caused by men and other beasts . When an herb was promising , he grew and nurtured it , taught it more of what he wanted it to do , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powders that could cure disease , berries that took away all pain . And he knew the inward shape of every body just by looking at its outward lines . The lizard and the lyon , the rubin and the grouse , he knew them , could cut them open and set them to rights . He could never have set his knowledge down in books , like humans did . Poor humans  --  they lacked the othermind , the secret memory in which geblings hid their great learning even from themselves . If you asked Ruin what was wrong with one of his many patients , he could not tell you , for his manmind , his wordmind  --  it knew nothing of healing . His wordmind could only speak , could only remember sights and sounds ; he had no use for it . It was his othermind that he trusted , his othermind that he let rule him , and his othermind that held all his greatest gifts . Except it was also his othermind that Unwyrm had found and forced away from Cranning . Only his weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , struggling for control of his legs and arms , in the endless vertical climb to meet his enemy . And when I meet him , what will I do ? What am I fit for , except to be the first of my people to be devoured ? It was near nightfall and Ruin was bitter with failure when he reached the house he shared with Reck . He knew from the smell that there were humans inside , knew also that it was the old man who was injured and the young woman who most loved and feared for him . The fat woman was just a pile of sweat ; he disregarded her . There was also the smell of Will , but Ruin disregarded him , too . If his sister wished to keep a human instead of an ox , that was her prerogative . Ruin never spoke to Will , and Will returned the favor . Reck greeted him without a touch or a smile . There had been anger here . Ruin questioned her in Geblic . " Why do you let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl , " said Reck . " Tell me you ca n't feel it , what she does to Unwyrm , being here . " Ruin strode to the boy-dressed girl , sitting on the floor in the corner . Yes , he could feel it too , like prickles on his spine . Near her , Unwyrm was not driving them away at all . He was calling . It was something Ruin had never felt before , though he had heard of it : the Cranning call . It was unbelievably strong , like the promise of sexual pleasure , like a mother 's love for a child . Ruin knelt and put his face close to the girl 's face . He ignored her revulsion , ignored the hand that went up to her hair . The fat woman shouted from by the fire . " Keep that filthy beast away from her or I 'll kill him myself ! " " Quiet , " murmured the girl . " He has more to fear from me than I from him . " Ruin felt her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm breeze from Cranning , which called him now for the first time in his life . " A naked gebling coming at a girl like that , " grumbled the reeking ( ) Id dunghill . " Time was when goblins knew their place . " Reck called him back to duty . " The fat woman who loves geblings is Sken . The man who is dying is Angel . " Ruin pulled himself away from the girl . It was almost a physical pain , when the Cranning call receded . Standing well away from her , though , it still had power over him , for the constant pressure of Unwyrm 's hate ly was slackened . Ruin had never realized how much of his othermind Unwyrm had been using up . Now as he examined the wound , the understanding of it came so quickly and clearly that he could almost  --  not quite , but almost  --  bring it into his wordmind and explain it to himself . , ! ' For the first time he realized what he might become if Unwyrm were dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to waste time drugging him to sleep . He tasted the wound , which was still oozing blood . He knew the poison  --  one of the childish weeds that the wood-land robbers were so proud of . It was the arrow itself that worried Ruin more . It had done some tearing on the way in and would do more coming out . The man 's eating throat would not heal well , and he might starve to death before he could swallow again . " I 'll have to cut him , " said Ruin , again in Geblic . " To let him heal hi inside . You tell the humans . " He knew enough Agarant to make himself understood , but it was easier to let Reck deal with the humans . He Ih9 ' much preferred communicating with the animals that did n't think themselves intelligent .  | While Reck told the others what Ruin would do , he found the fungus spores that would undo the poison , chose a thin brass knife from his toolbox , and gently drew a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been no metal in the soil , so it was all organic , and would eventually dissolve inside the body . He put the blade and the wireweed in his mouth with a sprig of claffroot , to sterilize them . Then , in a swift motion , he cut deeply in the man 's throat , above and below the arrow . Ruin dipped his tongue in the fungus spores and then inserted his tongue in the incisions , deep within the wound , where the arrow 's poison still prevented the clotting of blood . It would take only a few minutes for the spores to do their work , feeding on the poison and then producing their own bloodbinder to help in the clotting of the blood . While he waited , he talked to Reck  --  in Geblic , of course , so the humans would n't understand . " The girl  --  who is she , and why is Unwyrm calling her ? " " How should I know ? " asked Reck . " You 're the one who knows all the wyrmlore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wise . " " Maybe she 's wise beyond her years . I think she 's more dangerous than she looks . She is n't afraid of anything . She said nothing of it , but I think she 's the one who killed most of Tinker 's men . " " With her bare hands ? " " You know the human woman that Unwyrm wants . The Vigilants tell everyone the prophecy of the seventh seventh seventh daughter ? " " I pay no attention to humans , least of all to their religions . " " The seventh seventh seventh daughter was born fifteen years ago , to the deposed Heptarch of Korfu , which claims to rule the world . She could be of that age . " " It 's too much to believe that of all the ways to Cranning , he would lead her right to us . " The spores had done their work ; the bleeding stopped . Ruin took hold of the arrowshaft and jerked it out . The man cried out in his sleep . More blood flowed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finger around the tattered esophagus and pulled it to where he could see it . Then he deftly made vertical cuts , removing the torn edges . While he sewed the wounds with the wireweed , he spoke to Reck in Geblic . " It does n't matter if she 's the one or not , though , does it ? She wo n't go to Cranning without us . " " I have no interest in Cranning , " said Reck.  | " You 're as much in this as I am , " said Ruin . " He presses you away as much as me . " " Except I do n't try to go there , so it does n't hurt me . You should n't try either , Ruin . Why do you think our family has stayed in exile all these generations , if not to be far from Cranning at just this time ? " " But he wants us to stay away . That changes everything . Every other time , he wanted the king to be there with him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? Then he controls us as surely as he ever did . " " Every other time , Sister , he wanted to use the geblings to destroy whatever it was the humans had been building . He has n't the strength to compel us all , but he compelled the king , and the king called the others to the common task . This time , though , it 's all different . He does n't plan to have the geblings act together . Perhaps he plans for us not to act together . And that 's why we have to go . " " Give up the governing purpose of our ancestors , on a guess ? " " The ancestor who first made this plan had been in Unwyrm 's control . That 's why he decided on exile . But how can we be sure our exile was n't what Unwyrm wanted him to decide ? " " There 's no way out of that circle , Brother . Who knows if anything we do will play into his hands ? " " You see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one : without Unwyrm 's breath in my face , Sister , I can finally breathe . Whether Unwyrm means it that way or not , she can take us through to him . " " Until the moment he stops calling her . " " It all depends on whether he wants her more than he fears us . " " So you believe she 's the one . " " Maybe fortune smiles on us . " Ruin finished with the esophagus and put it back in place . " Tell her that his throat will heal in a few days . It 'll be tighter than it was . He 'll have to chew his food . " Reck turned and , in Agarant , gave the news to the others . Ruin was still sewing up the outside wound , this time using common thread , when Reck finished and touched his shoulder . " Does it make a difference to you whether the girl knows our plans or not ? " " How would she know ? " asked Ruin , tying off the thread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ruin turned and looked at the girl . Her face was blank . " What makes you think so ? " " Because she was already relieved about Angel before I told her he  | would be all right . And then she pretended to be relieved again after I told her . But her sweat was all wrong . " Ruin grinned at the girl , letting his tongue hang out a little . He knew how the slender forked tongue of a gebling unnerved human beings , though in fact she showed no sign that it bothered her . He spoke to her in Geblic . " Never try to deceive a gebling , human . You 're the true Heptarch 's daughter , are n't you ? " The girl answered as smoothly and easily as if they had been conversing all day , and Ruin noticed that she spoke Geblic without a trace of the awkwardness humans often had in trying to form sounds with their blunt and stubby tongues . " No , sir . I am the Heptarch . " So her father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human . Humans put on a good show of grieving , but they did n't really understand the bonding of a true family . They had no othermind , and could speak only in words . They remained strangers from each other all their lives . What was the life of a creature like this ? So he offered no commiseration . " You know the payment that I want for your friend 's life . " " He 's my slave , not my friend , " she said . " You 'll take me with you . You 'll make no effort to go without me . " " Maybe I 'm not going where you think I 'm going . " " You 're going to Cranning to destroy my people , and I 'm going to save them . " " Then why not kill me now , and save us both a good deal of trou-ble ? " " He wants you , but if I killed you he might make do with someone else . At least we know who and where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be there , too . I think that means that we 're friends . " He smiled at her and let the tips of his tongue show . Reck stood by the stewpot , the tasting spoon in hand . " Why do you keep saying we , when I have no intention of going ? " Ruin did not look at her . " Because you 'd never let me face Unwyrm alone . " Reck shrugged . " Will 's stew is ready . " Ruin leaned closer to the Heptarch . Though she was sitting and he was standing up , he did not have to bend far for their eyes to meet . " Will you give me your word ? In payment for your slave 's life ? " " You have my word , but not in payment for anything . Angel 's life is his own to repay , and my word is my own to give . " Ruin nodded solemnly . " Then come join us at table . "  | Reck laughed aloud . " It was worth all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruin , inviting a human to eat with you . " " But she 's not a human , is she , Reck ? She 's Unwyrm 's woman and the mother of death . " " I am no one 's woman , " said the girl . " And my name is Patience . " It was Ruin 's turn to laugh . " Patience , " he said in Agarant . " Come and eat , Patience . " The table was designed for the comfort of geblings . It was too low for Patience to sit on a chair , so she sat on the floor . She was the only human at the table . When Sken took a step toward them , Ruin 's look was enough to drive her back to her stool near the fire . Will made no effort to sit . He served them , then took a bowl to Sken . Ruin noticed that Patience observed all the proper forms of respect . She had been well enough taught that it seemed as natural to her as to a gebling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or to Reck , and to nibble at the bites they offered her . On those rare occasions when humans were invited to share a gebling meal , they usually showed what a great effort and sacrifice it took to eat from a gebling spoon . But Patience showed nothing but deference and grace . Unwyrm 's woman should be loathsome , not gracious , thought Ruin . But it makes no difference . Before all this is over , I 'll probably have to kill her after all . What 's the death of a human , if it might save my people ? When the food was finished off , they drank hot water from the pot by the fire . Ruin offered to take them through the forest , but Patience would have none of it . " I take my people with me , " she said . " When Angel is strong enough , we 'll take him in the carriage . If we can find horses to buy . " Reck shrugged . " Buy ? Ruin can find your horses tomorrow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull the carriage , though , " he said . " We 'd spend all our time dragging it out of mudholes . We 'll go to the next human town and sell it and buy a boat . The wind is out of the west , and Cranwater is wide and flat . The roads are the worst way to Cranning . " So it was agreed . The only argument came later , in , the darkness , when Ruin lay beside his sister and she told him she meant to bring Will along . " What is he to you ? " asked Ruin for the thousandth time . " Is he your lover , now ? Do you want to bear his little monsters ? " She never answered such accusations . She only said , " He is my friend , and if I go , he goes too . " " So the giant comes with us . We 'd better buy a large boat . There are  | too many of us already . And too many humans altogether . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did whenever Ruin was away . She did n't answer , and he only stopped when her breathing told him that she had fallen asleep . It was hardly worth trying to make her angry anymore .  | They were not the happiest party ever to set out for Cranning . Angel was too weak from hunger and loss of blood to do more than endure the jolting of the road . Though he could , painfully , drink milk from the farmhouses they passed , it would take time for him to come back up to strength , and even when he was conscious , he listened to the conversations of the others and almost never tried to speak . When they stopped at inns along the way , Patience fed him gruel in his room while the others ate at the common table . And the geblings slept in his room through the night , taking turns watching over him when , asleep , he clawed at the pain in his throat . If Angel was silent , then Sken seemed never to stop speaking . She grumbled about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word to or about the geblings if she could help it , she made it plain that she loathed them . She had a way of sniffing the air when Ruin was near . And whenever Patience and the geblings spoke " that jabbering noise , " she grew sullen and threw nutshells at the horses ' backs with particular vehemence . Not Sken 's surliness , not even Angel 's misery ever engaged Patience 's attention for long , however . She was caught up in other concerns . The  | Cranning call grew stronger in her every day , often distracting her from whatever she was doing or thinking . And the call was changing form as well . It was no longer just an urgency in her mind . Now it was a hunger in her body . Night , in an inn not far from the river Cranwater . She dreamed a deep and powerful and terrifying and beautiful dream . " Patience , " whispered Sken . Sken was shaking her . It was still dark . Was there some danger ? Patience reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sken tried to push her back down onto her mat . Sken 's push , the physical restraint , gave Patience a new fear , that Sken herself meant her harm . Patience was trained to protect herself against just such an attempt at murder in the night . For a moment , because she was not yet fully awake , her reflexes controlled her , and she lashed out ; then she came to herself and stopped , her fingers already hooking behind Sken 's ears , her thumbs poised to gouge out the riverwoman 's eyes . " Sweet lass , " said Sken . " Just what your mother hoped you 'd grow up to be , I bet . " The condemnation in Sken 's words , the residue of momentary terror in her voice , the loathing revealed by the scant light that crossed the woman 's face  --  This is how ' they see me , thought Patience . The common people , the people who play with their children , dance at the festival until they 're drenched with sweat , scream and whine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a child my age should be a virgin at heart . If I were wise in the ways of love , that would sadden them , yes , as it does all adults when a child 's body comes awake . But to see a child so young already ripe in violence and murder  --  I am a monstrous thing to Sken , like the deformed babies who are strangled and burned by the midwives . Almost she said this : I was trained to be what I am , and I 'm the best at what I do . Then Sken would accuse her : This is the second time you tried to kill me . Or perhaps ask a bitter question : Do you murder even in your sleep ? Then Patience would say : How do you think a king keeps the peace , if not with tools like me ? But she would not defend herself . She might sometimes wish that she were not her father 's daughter , but wishing would n't change the past . She had no more need to defend what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being tall and craggy , or worn down and knobby , or  | whatever other shape it might have . What I am is what was done to me , not what I chose . So instead of answering Sken 's ironic words , Patience lived up to her name , and quietly asked , " Why did you wake me ? " " You were crying out in your sleep . " " I do n't do that , " said Patience . Had n't Angel schooled her to be utterly silent in her sleep ? She remembered all too well the cold water dashed in her face to wake her each time she made a sound , until she learned habits of sleep that kept her still . " Then it 's a miracle , a voice coming out of the air above your bed , and sounding just like you . " " What did I say ? " " From your cries , girl , I could think only one thing . That a lover was prying at you as vigorous as a farmer rooting out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of her dream come back to her , and with it the Cranning call . " He does it to me , " she whispered . " He sends me dreams . Waking , sleeping ? " Sken nodded knowingly . " You dream until your whole body 's ready for him , but he never comes to you . " " I have to go to him . " " The curse of women , " said Sken . " We know how they mean to use our love for them , we know the whole price of it is ours to pay , but still we go , and still we stay . " " This one 's no ordinary lover , " said Patience . Sken patted her head . " Oh , true . True , the one you love is never ordinary . " What , did she really think Patience was lovesick like some village maiden , pining for the handsome farmboy ? Because Patience had never had such a girlish feeling , she wondered for a moment if Sken might not be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in many noble houses , had heard them gossip about their real and would-be lovers . Unwyrm 's relentless calling was far stronger . Even now it stirred within her ; it took effort not to get up from her mat , leave the shabby inn , and walk , run , ride , or swim to Cranning . Still , Sken 's ignorant assumptions were harmless enough . In other times , Patience would have seemed to accept Sken 's attempt at consolation . But she was too weary , too edgy from the Cranning call to care to play the diplomat . So she answered with the nastiness she felt . " And if I wait long enough , will I get over it ? " Sken , of course , had no diplomatic instincts . " You are a little bitch . A body tries to be nice ? "  | Patience answered , as if to explain everything about herself , " I 've faced death more times this month than you have in your life . " Sken was still a moment , then smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " We 're not on the water now , " said Patience . " Nor are we assassinating anybody , " Sken answered . Patience lay back on the mat and smiled icily . Sken had made her point . " Death and the river , we each know our trade , " said Patience . " This lover who makes you sweat and cry out in your sleep ? " " Not my lover , " said Patience . " He wants you , does n't he ? And you want him ? " " He wants me like a jackal hungers for a lamb . And I want him like ? " " Like a fish wants water . " Patience shuddered . That 's how it felt , even now , like needing to take a breath , a deep long draught of air . But if she took that breath , it would be her last . " Sken , " said Patience , " I 'm made of paper . " Sken touched her gently , stroked the cold damp flesh of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone . " " Paper . Folded this way and that , taking whatever shape they give me . Heir to the Heptagon House , daughter of Peace , assassin , diplomat , give me a shape , I 'll wear it , I 'll act the part , fold me again , again , I 'll be his lover , the one who calls me , and if he ever gets me , he 'll fold me down so small I 'll disappear . " Sken nodded wisely , her whole body jiggling just a little with the movement . " What if someone unfolded me all the way ? What would I be then ? " " A stranger , " said Sken . " Yes , even to me , " said Patience . " Just like everybody else . " " Oh , do you think so ! Do you think something like a normal woman lives inside this lovely delicate murderer 's body ? " " Do n't take on such airs , " said Sken . " We 're all folded up , and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're all identical , blank , II empty pieces of paper . It 's the folding that makes us different . We are the folds . Patience shook her head . " No , not me . Probably no one starts out blank and smooth , but certainly not me . I 'm more than what they 've done to me . I 'm more than the roles I have to play . " " What are you , then ? "  | " I do n't know . " She rolled over , faced the wall to end the conversation . " Maybe I wo n't find out until just before I die . " " Or maybe just after , when they take your head . " Patience rolled back , caught the folds of Sken 's robe in her tightclutching fingers . " No , " she whispered harshly . " If they ever do that to me , promise you 'll split my head in two , you 'll pour out the gools , something ? " " I wo n't promise that , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in such a state that they could take your head , Heptarch , it means I 'm already dead . " Patience relaxed her grip on Sken 's clothing , lay back down . The knowledge of Sken 's loyalty was a comfort . But it was also a burden . Patience was so tired . " Go to sleep , " said Sken , " and do n't dream of love . " " What should I dream of , then , since you 're the master of sleep . " " Dream of murder , " said Sken . " Knowing you , you 'll sleep like a baby . " " I do n't love death , " whispered Patience . Sken patted her hand . " No , I did n't think so . " " I did n't want my father to die . Nor Angel to be injured , I did n't wish for it . " Sken looked puzzled . Then she understood . " I know you did n't wish for it , girl , " she whispered . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? For a time at least . So of course that feels good . " " Exciting , sometimes . Scary . " " And knowing you face the strongest enemy in the world , alone ? " " Does n't make me feel good . " " Do n't lie , " said Sken . " You love it , sometimes . " " I hate him for what he 's making me want ? " " But to stand alone against him , you want that , you want to face him alone and win . " " Maybe . " " It 's perfectly natural to feel that way . It 's also perfectly natural to be an idiot . " " I can kill anybody . " " Anybody you want to . " The words sank in . " You 're right , " said Patience . " How can I kill him , if he makes me love him ? " " You see ? You ca n't do this alone , " said Sken . " You need Angel . You  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet giant , too . You may even need me . " " Even you , " whispered Patience . " Sleep now . We 're all with you , you 're at the center of everything , we 're all with you . Plenty of time to unfold yourself when this is over , and your lover 's plow is hung on a wall somewhere . " Patience slept . She never spoke of the night 's conversation again , but things were changed between her and Sken . They bickered as always , because Sken hardly knew another way to deal with people , but things were changed . There were ties between them , ties between sisters , strange sisters indeed , but good enough . In the morning they traveled again , a queer caravan . But Sken 's words had made a difference in the way Patience saw the others , too . She looked at them with new eyes , thinking , How can I use him , Why do I need her , What is the strength he has that makes up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but also to Unwyrm . The geblings especially , they were a mystery . The more Patience watched them , the more she realized that they did most of their communicating without speech , each seeming to sense when the other was in need . She was jealous of their closeness ; she even tried to imitate them , going to Angel now and then , whenever she felt he might need her . Sometimes he did . More often he did n't . Whatever the geblings had , she lacked it . No special sensitivity . Geblings are too different from us . This power of theirs is something of this world , not from ours . They 're like Unwyrm . Both part of this place , and I 'm a stranger here . Then the days of land travel were over . The river stretched before them again , this time with a busy town along its bank . It was no trouble finding a merchant to buy the carriage and horses . This close to Cranning , all the buyers were geblings , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took Will with her so no one would try to rob her , and did all the bargaining herself , without Ruin or Reck present to foul the deal . Geblings had a way of giving gifts to each other instead of making a profit , and though Patience knew that Angel 's small treasury had money enough to buy as many boats as she liked , she did n't want to waste their resources . When what he had was gone , it could not easily be renewed . The carriage gone , the money in hand , Patience  --  still looking for all the world like a cocky young man  --  took Sken with her to buy a boat . Sken was a riverwoman , after all ; who else could judge a boat 's fitness for their upstream voyage ? " Not that one , " said Sken , time after time . Too small , too deep a  | draft , in bad condition , doomed to sink , not enough sail for upriver travel , too hard to steer  --  reason after reason to reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Patience . " I 'm not planning to live the rest of my life on it . " " If you buy the wrong boat , " said Sken , " that 's exactly what you 'll do . " As they walked the bustling wharf , Patience noticed that the boats were all being sold or hired out by humans . " It was a gebling who bought our carriage , " she said . " Do n't they travel by water ? " " Do n't ask me about goblins , " said Sken . " I hope those two do n't travel by boat . " " They saved a life that 's dear to me , " said Patience . " And if they do sail with us , I hope they remember who 's captain of the ship . " " I 'm captain of the ship , " said Patience . " Not any ship I 'll sail on , nor any sane person neither , " said Sken . " You 've got the money , that makes you owner . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Supreme authority ? " " Not quite . " " Oh ? Who 's higher than the captain ? " It was n't Sken who answered . The voice came from Patience 's other side , and it belonged to a man . " Pilot ! " he said . Patience turned  --  and saw no one , just a monkey jumping up and down as it pumped at a bellows . The bellows was connected to a tube that ran down into a thick glass jar , then up into the windpipe of a head whose eyes just peered over the top . " Pilot ? " asked Patience . Sken had not yet turned . " Yes , a pilot . Someone who knows the river . Every river is different , and different from year to year , as well . " Then she saw the one who had spoken , the head perched in a thick glass jar . Sken wrinkled up her face . " A dead one , " she said . " Lot of good he 'll do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred years , " said the head . " Heads do n't learn , " said Patience . " Heads do n't pay attention , and they forget too quickly . " The monkey kept jumping up and down . It was distracting . " I pay attention , " said the pilot 's head . " I know this river . Some pilots , the river 's like an enemy , they wrestle it up and down . Some , it 's like a god , they worship , they pray , they curse . Some , it 's a whore for I Ili III  | them , they think they 're in charge but she plays them for fools . Some , it 's a lover , a wife , a family , they live and die for it . But me ? " " Come along , young sir , " said Sken . But Patience stayed to listen . " For me , the Cranwater 's not like anything else . This river is myself . That 's my name , River , as God gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my body , my arms , my legs . " The monkey stopped to pick a louse . The head grinned , but because the mouth was lower than the lip of the jar , the thick glass transformed the smile into a hideous leer . The monkey tasted the louse , swallowed , and went back to work . Again the breath came through the pilot 's throat . " My boat 's good , " said River . " Your boat 's a rotten old canoe , " said Sken . " So . You 're the captain , you get a good boat , but you come back and buy me for pilot . " " We 'll get a live pilot , thanks all the same , " said Sken . " That 's right , walk away , you 've got legs , you can just walk off , what 's that to you ? " A hawk swooped low , circled , came back and landed on a small platform atop the pole where River hung . It held a squirming rat in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snatched the guts into its beak , then dropped the rest of the carcass into River 's jar . The jar lurched as the gools and headworms attached themselves and fed . " Pardon my lunch , " said River . " As you see , I 'm a self-contained system . You do n't have to feed me , though I 'm glad if you can keep my jar full of Cranwater , and it 's nice if you now and then wash my jar . Monkey 's apt to smear it with a bit of his stuff . " " Where 's your owner ? " asked Patience . Sken was irate . " You 're not thinking of ? " " Go buy a boat , Sken . You have fifteen minutes . Choose the best , and I 'll come negotiate the price . " " I wo n't have this thing as pilot ! " " If Ruin and Reck have to put up with you as ship 's captain , you 'll learn to live with River as pilot . Were n't you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're enjoying this , " said Sken . " You 're making sport , and I thought we were friends . " " You 're not making a mistake , young master , " said River . " A pilot has to know the sandbars , the currents , the fast places , the slow places , the shallow channels , the spring rises , I know them all , I 'll get you through , provided you do as I tell you , up to and including that Queen  | of Grease you have with you , what do you do , harvest her sweat and ! il sell it as lamp oil downriver ? " Patience laughed . Sken did not . " Buy the boat , " said Patience . " I want this pilot , for reasons that are good enough . " River cheered her on . " For reasons of wisdom , for reasons of ? " " Shut up , " said Sken to River . Then to Patience : " Young sir , you do n't know this man ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's at least two centuries , in hard sunlight and bad weather much of the time . " " Ah , it 's the truth , the torture of my life written on my face , " said River . " So he 's old , " said Sken . " He 's been a head at least a century , " said Patience . " Plying the river all that time . And in those many voyages , he 's never failed a customer . He 's never broken up a boat on a sandbar or a rock . " " How do you know that ? " Sken demanded . " Because the young master 's got the spirit of discernment of truth in him , " said River . " Because he 's here , " said Patience . " If he 'd ever let an owner down , his jar would have been broken , and he would have been poured out into the river long ago . " Sken glared , but had no answer . So she went farther along the dock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . " You 've got wisdom , " said River . " I hope that among the hundred sons I conceived when I could still do the mattress hornpipe , there 's one as well-favored and intelligent and ? " " And rich . " " As your most gracious self . Though I could wish a son of mine might have more of a beard on him . " " As he would no doubt wish his father to have more limbs . " River giggled , an artificial-sounding laugh because it all came from his mouth . There could be no belly laugh , with the monkey pumping the bellows with the same steady rhythm . " Ay , there 's something lacking on both of us , I ca n't deny it . " " When will your owner come back ? " asked Patience . " When I send the monkey to fetch him . " " Then send . " " And miss out on conversation with such a likely young man ? I buggered a few as fair as you in my time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward. "  | " As I 'll thank you for mislaying your practical buggery tools before we met . " River winked . " Nothing shocks you , does it ? " " Nothing that lives in a jar , anyway , " said Patience . " Send the monkey . If you want to talk , I can read your lips . " River made three sharp kissing noises . Patience realized that it was a sound he could make without the bellows . The monkey immediately dropped the bellows and clambered around to perch on the lip of the jar , pressing his forehead against River 's . A few more chirping sounds , tongue clicks , lip pops , and the monkey dropped to the wooden dock and ran off through the crowd . River made a single clicking sound , and the hawk took off and flew away . Patience stood , reading his lips as he made jokes , told stories , and studied her with his eyes . All the while , Patience felt Unwyrm calling her . Come faster , I need you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in words , it was never words , it was just the need . Fly to me now . I 'm coming , said Patience silently , trying hard not to think consciously of the murder in her mind . The head named River babbled on and on , looking less and less like her father the longer she watched . Good . She did n't need the distraction . Once they were on the water , Sken was in her element , and lorded it over them all . Never mind River muttering commands from his jar , which dangled from a pole near the helm ; Sken was glad enough to follow River 's orders about where to steer , once he showed that he really did know the river . Steering was the pilot 's business  --  everything else about the boat was Sken 's to decide . Only Angel , lying in comfort at last , without the bouncing of the road , only he was exempt from her orders . All the others , Sken kept them hopping with the business of a boat making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular pleasure in ordering Reck and Ruin to climb the mast and fiddle with the two sails  --  she watched with unbearable satisfaction on her face as they dangled over the water doing her bidding . The height did n't seem to bother them , nor the work , but the water itself seemed to make them uncomfortable . And credit Sken with this : she did not abuse her authority . Like any good captain , she knew that the geblings would obey her , but only as long as she ordered them to do what was clearly needful . Patience did her part as well , a full share of work , like any of the  | others . At first Sken was uneasy ordering her about , but if she left Patience without labor , Patience would come and ask , until Sken barked out commands to her as easily as to anyone . Patience was grateful for anything that engaged her mind . The Cranning call was relentless , but it was easier to live with when she was busy . So she spent many an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the helm as River ordered their way upstream , tacking across the current to keep the wind , easing into deep channels with oars or poles to get past the tricky places  --  it was a vigorous , hardworking life , and Patience came to love the river , partly because of the peace it brought to her , partly for the life itself . Sken 's coarseness and crudity became vigor and strength , when seen within the river life . For all that Sken was a good captain , though , she was not perfect . Patience noticed within a few days that Sken tyrannized Will without mercy , perhaps merely because he let her do it . No doubt they weighed about the same , but she was a good meter less in height . It was comical , watching him pull on a rope or haul something above or below deck , his massive muscles rippling along his body as he worked , while all the time the jiggling fat woman scolded and cursed him . Poor Will , thought Patience . All the pangs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore it well and did n't seem to mind . It became part of the equilibrium . Patience let it go . It was early morning . Will was drawing up the anchor while Reck was raising the sail . Ruin sat in the bow , staring glumly ahead . Sken sent Patience to secure a line when Reck threw it down , and the task brought her near to Ruin , who was not working this shift . She saw him shudder at her approach . " Is it that strong , when you feel him calling me ? " she asked . He nodded , not looking at her . " Who is he , this Unwyrm ? " " Unwyrm . Himself . " " But what does he look like ? " " No one has ever seen him . " " Where did he come from ? " " He was born from the same belly as the geblings . " This was a religious language , of course , and Patience mentally deciphered it into her own version of reality . " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be . Only more powerful than any gebling . And he hates us . That 's all we know about him . " He raised a lazy hand to point at the river . " This water  --  he fills it with hate and sends it down to freeze us . " Iw
