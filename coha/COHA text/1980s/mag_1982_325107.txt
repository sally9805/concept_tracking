Pounding it out in Boston <P> Alberto Salazar 's victory in the Boston Marathon last week came in the record-breaking time of 2:08:51 . It was an extraordinary performance , but it was no more remarkable than the finish of Guy Gertsch . The Salt Lake City bus-station ticket agent finished No. 985 in the entirely ordinary time of 2:47 . But he did it on a broken leg . Gertsch , 38 , felt what he thought was a cramp starting after seven miles . But he was determined to finish , and so he pounded on for 19 more miles before collapsing at the finish line . Doctors , who later set his right femur with a steel rod , theorized that his powerful thigh muscle had acted as a splint until he finally relaxed at race 's end .
