The publisher , fresh off the plane from Johannesburg , breezes into the office and props his feet on a desk . " The Colonel , " as he likes to be called , discusses upcoming story ideas . Should next month 's cover feature a new machine gun , which the Colonel himself tested in South Africa ? What 's the latest battlefront news from Afghanistan and El Salvador ? The executive editor is there , but not the small-arms editor or the sniping-countersniping editor . The meeting soon breaks up , but not before the Colonel warns a staffer headed for Central America , " Be careful down there . " <P> No , this is not the office of Vanity Fair . Perhaps the only place where such a story conference could occur is at Soldier of Fortune , the macho magazine for adventurers ( armchair and otherwise ) . The Colonel is Robert K. Brown , 52 , a.k.a . " Uncle Bob , " the onetime Green Beret who started the magazine in 1975 and owns it lock , stock and carbine barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creator : blunt , individualistic , muscularly anti-Communist . As Brown celebrates Soldier of Fortune 's tenth anniversary this month , he makes no apology for the combative style  --  either his or the magazine 's . Since its founding as a quarterly with a print run of 8,500 , Soldier of Fortune , based in Boulder , has grown into a glossy monthly with a circulation of 166,000 , as much as such dissimilar journals as Harper 's and Mother Jones . " We have found a spot , " says Brown . " We put our lives where our mouths are , and readers can identify with that . " <P> Brown has certainly given new meaning to the phrase participatory journalism . The magazine has collected more than $100,000 for the Afghan rebels and dispatched its explosives-demolitions editor to instruct the mujahedin on the use of antitank mines . Brown has organized a dozen teams to train the Salvadoran army and loaned nine staffers to teach the contras fighting the Nicaraguan government . Brown still promises a $10,000 bounty , announced in 1979 , for the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reward is peanuts compared with his latest offer : $1 million to any pilot who defects with an Mi-24 helicopter , the Soviet hightech chopper delivered to the Sandinistas last year . <P> The foreign ventures usually end up as stories in the magazine , along with reminiscences of wartime derring-do , eyewitness combat reports and ratings of the latest weapons . ( Like publishers sending their books to a magazine for review , gun manufacturers ship their latest products to Soldier of Fortune editors , who test them at a nearby range . ) The prose is meat-and-potatoes style , heavy on facts , strategy and rip-roaring action . The September issue includes a feature about British Gurkha troops stationed in Belize , an interview with an Israeli army sniper and a story detailing which stainless-steel handguns fare best in the rust-inducing jungles of El Salvador ( answer : the Randall LeMay and the Walther PPK/S ) .
