" Our state is literally on fire , " said Montana 's Governor Ted Schwinden , who had only to look out the window of his office in Helena to see thick gray smoke billowing skyward last week from the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness Area , 20 miles from the state capital . Touched off by lightning strikes and whipped by winds that at tunes exceeded 50 m.p.h. , flames devoured more than 220,000 acres of unusually dry timber and range lands , creating what is considered the worst conflagration in Montana since 1967 . Some 5,000 fire fighters , including many from neighboring states , battled throughout the week , at a cost of $1 million a day , to bring 18 major fires under control . Supporting the fire fighters were 21 helicopters and 42 air tankers that sprayed water and fire-retardant chemicals from above . Despite the efforts , Schwinden observed , " you do n't fight a fire like this . You simply get people out of the way and wait for the winds to die down . " Late in the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the western portion of the state , allowing shallow trenches dug by fire fighters to halt the spread often of the fires . <P> Hardest hit was an area near the town of Roundup ( pop . 2,119 ) in southeastern Montana , where 37 homes were destroyed by a blaze that began in the arid Bull Mountains , sending up columns of smoke that drifted into Billings , 30 miles to the south . " It sounded like a jet engine coming through , " said Dana Lynam , 34 , after a wall of flames attacked her house and melted nearby mobile homes and autos in minutes . Lynam and some 500 others throughout the state were evacuated in time to escape the flames . <P> At night the mountain blazes cast an eerie red glow in the sky to the north of Helena , reminding residents of one of the region 's worst forest fires , the Mann Gulch fire of 1949 , which cost the lives of 13 fire fighters . " It looks like someone dropped the Bomb somewhere , " said one resident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and timber , but the damage totaled millions of dollars . Near Libby , in the northwest corner of the state , 16 barns and other farm buildings were consumed by a blaze along Houghton Creek in the Kootenai National Forest . Miraculously , though , by week 's end there were no reports of lives lost to the statewide inferno.
