WASHINGTON - President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada engaged in some well-mannered sparring yesterday over economic issues dividing them , in particular , and the leaders of the non- Communist world in general . On topics including the industrial pollution of acid rain , Canada ' s tough new line on foreign investment , as well as policies to aid the poorest nations of the developing world , Reagan and his host-to-be at next weekend ' s seven- nation economic summit near Ottawa made little negotiating headway . Trudeau spent nearly two hours at the White House , mostly to go over the summit agenda as he has recently with other participants but also to touch on a few matters of US-Canadian concern , which the two had discussed during Reagan ' s trip to Canada earlier this year . While he said during brief remarks upon his departure that the meeting " has made my job as chairman of the summit easier , " Trudeau stressed that most of his talk with Reagan involved " possibly divergent issues . " Regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe and Japan a strong belief that more aid programs are a necessity . He also is known to be concerned that the United States under Reagan is backing off past US commitments and shifting its emphasis from development to combatting leftist insurgencies . According to a senior Reagan Administration official , the President was not particularly encouraging to Trudeau on this sensitive matter yesterday . The official told reporters that Reagan described his hopes for a US-supported economic development program for the nations of the Caribbean and repeated his commitment to attend a conference of the rich and poor nations in Mexico in the fall . Other than that , the United States official said , the President confinedhimself to conservative generalities , telling Trudeau that the best help the industrialized countries can provide is to show the poor ones how to develop their economies . Reagan noted that the United States and Canada were once poor nations that became world powers by encouraging private enterprise , the official said . Canadian officials here said Trudeau was " somewhat encouraged " by Reagan ' s attempts to forge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much attention was being given to propping up the ruling junta in El Salvador with military aid and not enough attention was being paid worldwide development needs . Reagan is certain to hear more of that kind of talk from other heads of government when he gets to Canada next Sunday . The American official said bilateral issues were brought up near the close of their discussion , but he indicated that no progress was made on any of them . In two instances - pollution being carried by the wind into Canada and New England from factories and mills in the Midwest , and the proposed pipeline to bring Alaskan gas across Canada to American markets - officials from both sides said the two leaders simply agreed to keep pressure on their respective negotiating teams . In still another matter , Trudeau ' s government has been for some months taking an increasingly tough line toward foreign investment in its industry , particularly of oil and gas properties . American companies have screamed in protest , and the Administration has lent a sympathetic ear . Just this week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of a 60-year-old law that woulddeny Canadian energy concerns the right to purchase mineral leases on potentially oil-rich US lands . Sources said it was Reagan who brought up the issue at lunch yesterday , by noting that the pressures for a retaliatory policy were building in Congress . Trudeau , however , while expressing sympathy with the President ' s situation , defended his government ' s policy . Officials said he noted that Canada ' s investment policies were liberal and that the value of foreign investment ( 80 percent of it American ) had grown from $1.5 billion in the early 1970s to more than $6.5 billion last year . Relations have also suffered in the wake of unsuccessful attempts by Canadian companies to acquire US firms , mostly notably the thwarted tender offer by Seagram ' s for a majority interest in Conoco Inc . Trudeau , sources said , alluded to this yesterday by noting that Canadian companies account for only 15 percent of the foreign investments in the United States .
