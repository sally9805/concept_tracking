By Nino Lo Bello SANTA VITTORIA , Italy - There is still just one more tiny untold secret to " The Secret of Santa Vittoria , " the best-seller novel in the 1960s by Robert Crichton that later became a successful movie with Anthony Quinn . Said untold secret , revealed now for the first time , is the exciting fact that tourists coming to this hill town , where the long Italian boot changes into a fat thigh , can now do what the Nazis couldn ' t . It is now possible to visit the secret underground vault where Santa Vittoria hid nearly two million bottles of precious vermouth and sparkling wines from a searching German army . On one of the most colorful single acts of resistance of the Second World War , some 1000 Santa Vittoria villagers , all of whom knew where the wines were hidden , kept the secret to themselves , hoodwinking the Nazi officers . The conspiracy foiled the Germans , saved the hidden bottles and put Santa Vittoria on the map . Resting on the crest of a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quietly turbulent waters of the glacier- fed Tarano River , Santa Vittoria lies tucked away 36 miles south of Turin on the road from Alba to Bra . No one can tell you exactly how old the celebrated hamlet is , except that it has always been there . The earliest church records , however , show birth and death entries that go back to 1859 when the population was still a thousand . To visit the celebrated wine hideaway , you have to go a few hundred feet down beyond the winding streets and slate-roofed houses of Santa Vittoria to the big winery owned by the Cinzano family , which has been making vermouth there since the early 19th century . As part of the plant itself , the cellar in question is 226 feet long , 50 feet wide and 26 feet high . On request , the Cinzano office will provide you with an oenologist who will take you around at no cost . No regular tours are scheduled per se - but everybody who comes to look is given every courtesy , including a jigger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst hasn ' t . According to Italo Rosso , the guide who took me around , it takes three years to make a good vermouth . Up to 200 different barks and herbs are used for flavoring an already good wine , and these have to age and blend in a carefully controlled manner . While aging , the bottles need regular attentionbecause of the dripping , sweating and bottle-explosions - the last phenomenon can bring on a chain reaction and destroy hundreds of bottles . Except for a love story and the fictionalization of characters , the 1966 Crichton novel is true in many details . In the spring of 1945 when the war waswinding down , a cadre of 100 German soldiers was moving toward Santa Vittoria , pillaging and looting anything in the area . The troops , led by a Captain Helmut Wesser , 32 , tall , blond and arrogant , were hunting down those precious wines for home morale and the money . The people of Santa Vittoria did not want their two million bottles swiped , and under the inspired leadership of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they decided to reopen an old dank cellar that hadn ' t been used in over 90 years , place all the bottles inside and seal up the hiding place with a false wall . However , each local resident was sworn to secrecy . The Germans were only 28 miles away when everybody in Santa Vittoria , working around the clock feverishly , lugged the bottles into the old brick cavern which had been part ot the Cinzano winery . Once that was done , and the cellar was filled to the bursting point , a false wall had to be built . No easy job , this , for the fake facade had to look ancient . Merely using old bricks was not enough , for over the years the surrounding walls had grown their own mosses , lichens and fungi . In some places the fungus growth was almost an inch thich and slimy . How to disguise the new wall was a big problem , but Marone and a sidekick , Umberto Gatti , came up with an idea : once having transplanted as many tufts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour vermouth over them to stimulate growth . In the six days it took the Germans to arrive , the wall became indistinguishable from the old bricks nearby . After the Germans commandeered 100 rooms and 100 beds , Capt . Wesser ( as luck would have it ) set up his headquarters , to everyone ' s horror , right there in the Cinzano office , a few feet away from the fake wall ! Marone and Gatti now gave orders to the villagers to show extraordinary hospitality and supply the Germans with a constant flow of sparkling wines - all designed to keep the invaders half-drunk or totally drunk much of the time , and thus less likely to notice the critical new " old " wall in their search for the cache . The sudden arrival of an entire regiment of dusty New Zealand infantrymen forced Wesser and his men to flee and Santa Vittoria ' s secret remained safely buried . There ' s a final note of irony to the story . After Wesser and his squads camped at nearby Bra , two Santa Vittoria townsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that read : " we just wanted you to know that we have 1,999,998 more like these back in Santa Vittoria . In vino veritas ! Heil Hitler ! " Nino L. Bello writes from Austria . B07862049
