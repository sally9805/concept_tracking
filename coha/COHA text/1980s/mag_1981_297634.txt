Richard Allen 's first mistake was not saying no to his friend with the $1,000 . At the White House , you say no to a Japanese with an envelope of cash the same way you say no to an American with an envelope of cash-lips pursed , arms firmly folded across the chest . But that mistake was rather minor and excusable . <P> Allen 's second mistake , which was about 50% bigger than the first , was not reporting and logging the gift and dispatching it instantly to the Treasury Department , which is only 50 yards from the White House and will accept any kind of bills Still , two mistakes of this nature do not a tragedy make . <P> But the third mistake that Allen made changed the chemistry of the event . He decided that his survival in his job as National Security Adviser to Ronald Reagan was terribly important to the President and to the nation . He concluded that he had been wronged by events and therefore he must fight . He would not resign . That third mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a President have to learn is that they are totally dispensable . The moment they begin to believe that they have a right and/or a duty to cling to their jobs is the moment they start downhill . <P> Confusing personal concerns with what is good for the nation has crippled many an Administration , as Jimmy Carter discovered when he refused to acknowledge the evil ways of his debt-laden Budget Director , Bert Lance . <P> Allen 's fourth mistake was casting the crusade for his honor as a media event . For nearly a week , he all but chased Reagan off the front pages . Allen 's convoluted explanations weighted the flow of news and information about the Government . These stories , hyped by their eager victim , intruded into the public 's business and obstructed the White House campaigns on the budget and arms reduction . Allen , in trying to save his own neck , raised himself above the President . <P> A presidency can not work that way . Everybody and everything in and around the White House is for the protection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unwritten code of conduct that any time someone troubles a President , he or she should submit a resignation quickly and quietly . The issue is not really whether the individual has been accused falsely or been treated fairly . Preventing damage to the President transcends all considerations . Bo Callaway , former Secretary of the Army and Gerald Ford 's campaign manager , understood the code . Falsely accused of conflict of interest over a Colorado ski resort development , Callaway resigned-and then cleared himself of the charges . <P> Walter Jenkins and Lyndon Johnson both knew the rules when Jenkins , L B J ' s principal aide and close friend , was arrested in the Washington Y.M.C.A. in 1964 . L.B.J. demanded an immediate resignation , saying " On this case , as on any such case , the public interest comes before all personal feelings . " Dwight Eisenhower 's chief of staff , Sherman Adams , who was probably as indispensable an aide as ever inhabited the White House , started to believe bis own clippings . <P> When he hung around after the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor seeker , sweet old Ike lowered the boom . He sent Party Chairman Meade Alcorn to push Adams out the door .
