INTERIOR , THE STUDIO , MORNING LIGHT A story by Jeremy Larner I WAS READING Dust Krosley 's script again when Judi buzzed me and said McKenzie had arrived and wanted me in his office . It was my habit to read a little of Kros-ley 's script the first thing every morning . Dust Krosley himself was planted in the outer office , smiling that shy , sour smile of his . I got a close-up of his delicate eyelids fluttering beneath rimless glasses , his beaten-up hands , bitten-down nails . " Dust ! " I yelled . " Dust from the desert ! " I 'd found it best in this town to exclaim one 's enthusiasms . " Hello , Peter , " said Dust , " Say ? " " Parker , " I said . " Parker Peters . " " Say , " said Dust . He was waving a leather-bound book he 'd picked up off our shelves . " Has McKenzie really done twelve films ? " " You read German ? " I said . " Enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a package of excrement , and passed on to the inner office . Mac was listening on the phone and staring out the window . " Bring it around to the house at seven , " he said . " The platinum . " He hung up , beckoned me . I joined him in a mental two-shot . A wide-angle lens zoomed past us , through the window , and down the studio block to a candy-flaked Maserati . The car gave off grains of prickly light . " What do you think ? " McKenzie said , his smooth face as always too close . " It does catch the eye , " I said , " if that 's what you want . " " You know what I 'm asking , link prick ! " He prodded my shoulder joint with his elbow . " It 's conspicuous , " I said . " I do n't know about conspicuous , " McKenzie said , " but it sure as hell is out of place . " I took my position on his short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pile of spiral-bound scripts . " Parker , I want you to stay here while I deal with old Dust . " " Why me ? " " You say something bright , he rattles on , he leaves feeling better . " " I 'd like him to feel better , " I said . " On account of his script . " " Yeah , yeah , I know , " said McKenzie . " You like cfood reading , do n't you , Parker kid ? " " Make some kind of thing someday , " I ventured . I wanted for my own sake to have said that . " Yeah , right , Parker , " McKenzie said . " For eighteen mil with no stars . " " Read it ? " I asked . He grinned . He liked being pushed at certain times . " I glanced at it . What kind of question 's that ? " He sat down with his arm around me , kneading my bicep . " Just wonder where your head 's at . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and did a little circle , which left him standing up and me sitting down again with some breathing space . " I just wish it were n't Dust , " I said . " I used to idolize Dust . I taught a seminar where we did The Streetwalker frame by frame . " " How come you never asked me to your seminar ? " " We did . " " Did I come ? " " It 's bard to say , " I said . He snorted . " I idolized him too , " he said . " When did you stop ? " " When he came to work for me . " I know what you mean . " " I doubt it , " McKenzie said . 69 H E PRESSED a button and spoke to Denni , covering for Judi . Dust Krosley came in doing a Bogart walk plus thirty pounds . He nodded to McKenzie , who sat watching him for a moment and made no move . Krosley lit a cigarette and let it hang from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one object to the next  --  the stills from Mac 's films ; the casual snaps of Mac with stars on the Via Veneto , in a rice paddy or with wives at some bright cottage ; bound and gold-stamped shooting scripts ; formal photographs of cars ; barbells ; a jacuzzi . I could see them detonate under Dust 's gaze . Dust waved out his match and tossed it on the floor , held up the German book and shook it at McKenzie . " They go into every picture , " he said , " like it was a Henry James novel . " Dust 's voice had a burr ; it scratched everything he spoke about . " Kind of gets you , does n't it , Dusty boy ? " McKenzie closed on him and grabbed his hand . They were the same size , the same age . Dust had on a suit and tie like my professors once wore . McKenzie had put on his pleated lounge pants and a suede-and-terry pullover . His Incite heels caught a gleam from the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A beat passed as they stood in stop motion . I was using my telephoto lens ; I wanted to get back , back , as far as I could go . Then Judi broke the frame , bringing in a special cartridge belt Mac had ordered . Judi is always on uppers and now she was tripping on how she 'd tracked down this new thing for McKenzie and how it looked on him . Dust 's look hit her right in the teeth and broke off . She 'd never detonate , did n't even know he had eyes . Mac carefully tried on the belt and asked me what I thought . I commented . Dust rumbled how one could n't be too careful when it came to cartridge belts . McKenzie turned this way and that , continuing to examine the belt as he took a call . Judi got our orders for coffee , still not encountering Dust 's gaze . McKenzie whacked down the phone and turned to get it over with . " Dust , " he said , " you wrote a helluva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , " Dust said . He struggled to suppress a smile . " Well , that 's news . Coming from you . Of course I 've had three months to show it to people I respect . " McKenzie put his fingers together thoughtfully . " There 's no doubt but that you are one of the great living screenwriters . I 'd say that without hesitation to anyone . " " I did n't really come here for reification . " " Reification ! " McKenzie laughed . " This man kills me . " Judi brought in coffee for Dust and me and mineral water for Mac . Judi said she 'd been thinking how she loved the cartridge belt . " Girl meets cartridge belt , " said Dust to me from the side of his mouth . " I thought it was delicate , " I said , " the way you sketched in the business with the woman . Much more believable than in the novel . " " It was n't in the novel , " he said . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It seems better to have them knowing one another than meeting , " I said , showing again I really had read it . " Well , it cuts the nonsense about the girl of his dreams . He knows her as someone to talk to , a waitress in a diner late at night ? " " I know , " I said . In the background McKenzie stared out the window . " At first , " said Dust , " it 's carried by ragging , teasing . A kind of protected intimacy . " " Unacknowledged , " I said . " She takes him by surprise . When she turns up at the lake , suddenly they 're right up close ? " " And it collapses , " I said . " He ca n't take it . " I liked Dust tremendously . His round face was swelling against the metal sides of his glasses . " But he struggles back , " said Dust . " He knows he 's lacking something . " " That 's why you like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they do n't change . The woman is a gimmick . I wanted a movie where you see two people in the same frame affecting each other . You never see that anymore . " " Though people ? " I started to say . But the shape of McKenzie came between us . " That suit , " said McKenzie . " When you went to college , Dust , did you wear a suit like this ? " Dust shook his head . " The fraternity boys did , " McKenzie said . He expertly fingered the lapels , adjusted their roll , lifted the shoulder line . " There were n't any fraternities . " " A charcoal suit . I have n't seen " You wore a charcoal suit , " I said to McKenzie . Mac laughed , he poked Dust . Dust laughed briefly . Mac came over and poked me . " It 's about just what fascinates people , " Dust said loudly . " What they 're crazy look- ing for . That 's why " he swallowed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got to be , urn , to be very big commercially . " CKENZIE STROLLED about as Dust Krosley said his piece , recited a speech he 'd made up about matters he knew nothing about . Making money in the movies . Finally , McKenzie said , " C'm on , Dust , loosen your tie . " He put his hand on Dust 's tie and Dust slapped it away . McKenzie shrugged . " I got fifty of those ties , I 'm gon na get ' em in the mail to you tomorrow . " " Naturally , Mac , " said Dust . " I 'd appreciate any old clothes you can throw my way . But look . I put in ten months of my life , now I 'm ready to do a final draft . All I need is your involvement . " " Ah , yeah ! " said Mac . He poured himself more mineral water , looked at it carefully , drank it . His lips in close-up had a clean-edged grip on the glass . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I said . Some quibbles here and there . Maybe people want gimmicky women , maybe that 's why the book sold . Do we go to the movies for the same kind of bullshit we get around the house ? I do n't know . Anyhow we all agree it 's fine writing . Parker here 's gon na do his Ph.D . on the damn thing . But you know I told you from the beginning , even with my passion for the novel , I eventually had to work out my priorities . " " You told me , " Dust said , " we 'd make a great picture . " " Everyone sets out to make a great picture . " " The big chance , " Dust said . " You tied me up a whole weekend telling me how both of us were ready to take the big chance . You could n't do it without me , remember ? The only one ? The perfect team ? That Japanese buffet breakfast on your boat with the stomach-turning seaweed eggs ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture with Paul Newman . " " You do n't have to . " " Pm going to . " " That rodeo garbage ? " " It wo n't be garbage . " " I read the book , I read the script , they were written by a team of hack cretins . " I lit a cigarette , enjoying the precision of it . " Every man 's entitled to his opinion , " McKenzie said . He sat on the edge of his desk , idly swinging a golf putter . Dust went on talking , his head wrenched oddly around toward me , as I studied my cigarette . " Of course I read it in the papers a week ago . After three months without a word . My stomach dropped out , you know ? It was that here-it-is feeling , when you realize you 've known all along . " " Um-hmm , " said McKenzie . Without moving his behind from the edge of the desk , he shifted the grip on his putter , gave a perfect indication of a top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dust said , " that day when we supposedly talked about the first draft . We sat on the beach to improve your tan . We jogged , we swam , we ate , we drank ? " " I got you a towel . " " Thanks . You told me about your wife , your shrink , and your love life , such as it is . You were vaguely dissatisfied with my work , it was great of course , you just could n't pin down what bothered you . That was up to me . It was my script , never our script . All day long you looked at it only twice . You read me some long garbage from the book . You read like a first-grader , by the way , but I was polite , I 'm always polite till it 's too late . I had put too much of myself into it even then ? " " You can always put more . " " That 's nice to know . I had already put enough so I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and thought about changes . " And I came up with one more twist , which meant I had to change everything . It was as much work as starting from scratch . I even worked in that story you told me about your ironic little thing with Countess what-the-fuck's-her-name . " Dust paused , held his head in his hands . " And I made it work , too . " He brought his head up . " Did n't I make it work ? " " It has serious problems , " McKenzie said . " Compared to , say , your rodeo shuck ? " " Look , Dust , I 'm willing to sit all day and listen to your abuse , but what can I tell you ? What do you want me to say ? Your thing is better ? Okay , it 's better . But I do n't see it as a movie . The big guys upstairs would be more blunt . " " What the hell do you expect ? They 're wrong ! We can prove it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss was handling him , the words did n't matter , and I was getting the master shot from a platform fifty feet out the window . " I would n't doubt it , " McKenzie said . " The point is , they have to choose , just like you and me . " " You told me Newman was getting impossible . " " Not impossible . " " You thought you 'd done everything , now you want something that will stand up . " " Did I ever say I was n't a profit-making commercial film director ? " Filtered air , hazy shadows in the room . McKenzie lets the silence build , toys with his putter , glances at Krosley 's face . We see Dust 's flesh drawn down from the eyes and pouched over the cheekbones . The pouches tremble . Dust 's red veins cause Mac to frown : alcohol poisoning . Mac then brings the hint of a generous smile to his face , pulling a slight dimple into one taut cheek . The phone rings , Mac lets it ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner table , my own hand reaches to punch down a blinking clear button . I lift the receiver and murmur into the phone , my mouth concealed by my whitened knuckles . No one hears what I say , " All right , " says Dust quietly . " Let 's get it clear . You think the script has no merit . " " You 're playing games with me , Dust . " " You think it lacks ... what ? " McKenzie stands , moves over to Dust , looking down on his unkempt head . " You do n't believe it , Dust , but I 'm sorry . I 'm abjectly sorry . I will apologize before millions . The simple fact is I 've elected to do another project . Also I had no way of knowing . " " It 's a love story with suspense , danger . " Dust said these words as if pushing them out of his mouth . His lips puckered in distaste . " How commercial can you get ? " " It has incredible fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still get it going , " McKenzie said . " Talk to your agent . " Dust hung on . " Did you tell the studio guys do n't bother ? Did you show it to them at all ? " " I 'm telling you , call your agent . " " You could have said to them , ' Hey , read this ! We 're gon na do it ! ' These guys do n't know how to read anyhow . They know only what they hear . " " Do n't kid yourself , " said McKenzie mildly . In his loose , graceful way , he lined up an imaginary putt , ready to hole out on the eighteenth green of this conversation . " Listen to me , you candy-assed baby ! " i HAD TURNED from my camera to attend another cigarette , and in that moment Dust launched himself . l looked up as McKenzie went back sprawling into his long couch . Dust Krosley stood over him , brandishing the putter . He shook it my way , his face livid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutey ! Or I 'll knock your teeth in ! " " I have no intention , " I assured him . " I ? " " Shut up ! " Dust slammed the putter on the coffee table , shattering the glass . He raised the putter over McKenzie . His shoulders stretched massively beneath his padless Ivy jacket . His head was engorged , bullet-shaped against the window . I came in tight on my boss : Mac gazing in melodramatic terror . crawling backward into the cushions , one hand flung upward to ward off a blow . But on his face a crimson glow blossomed through his tan . His lips were frozen in a girlish grin . He was thrilled . Judi came in and McKenzie waved her out again . Dust snapped the putter over his thigh . In slow motion his stubby hand reached down , clamped McKenzie by the collar , and dragged him up from his couch . The seam of Mac 's pullover gave with a feeble hiss . Silhouetted in green window light , Dust pushed the broken shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought a twist this up your ass ! " He thrust McKenzie down , let go of him . McKenzie caught himself , palms against the carpet , looked up at me across the room . For one panicky moment I saw myself fired . Then I focused on a face that was unmistakably exultant . Dust removed the glasses hanging from one ear . He put his hiking boot on the remains of the coffee table . McKenzie sat on the floor . He sneaked a look at Dust , then ran his hand along his own pleated thigh and held it to his nose . He was marveling at the smell of his own sweat . " Now you sit there and listen ? " McKenzie 's face went slack with disappointment . Dust was only going to make a speech . McKenzie began to massage his leg , which had apparently gone pins and needles . Dust 's voice growled away , Bogarting . " You 're yellow . Mac , that 's one little reason why you 're not a great director and you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 're looking for class but you do n't have the guts to decide what you want and stick with it . You pick up ten , twenty thousand supposedly developing ' the script ? " " Peanuts ! " said McKenzie loudly . " Not when you do seven at a time , " Dust went on , " with seven suckers spilling their guts , each one thinking he 's got a picture in the works ! Then when you really have to shoot , you go into a panic , scurry around and get ten different writers to patch the script . Because you 're yellow . You go into the picture with a script in patches and you wheedle and fawn and coax something out of the actors . That 's what you 're good at , Mac . That 's how you make your money , that 's why you get your deals  --  because of what you squeeze out " ' That 's right , ' of other people 's talents ! " said McKenzie 's Abruptly McKenzie got up , walked to Dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . He pulled himself nothing n. perstraight , he was the same height as Dust again . s o n a l . ' " Dust had to stop talking . McKenzie shook ? slightly ; his hands quivered at his thighs . Involuntarily Dust 's arm jerked up into the hazy light . I thought he would bury his fist in Mac 's wide-open belly . But he only held it across his own gut , as a barrier . " What else ? " Mac said . Dust did n't answer ; he turned away , began to walk around the room , thoughtfully . McKenzie sat behind his desk again , folded his arms . In a minute Mac 's eyes were gone once more , out the window . Dust 's shoes crunched in the carpet : they came to a stop . " So I broke my balls for you . " Mac blinked . " What 's the matter , run out of attention span ? I broke my balls for you . Know what I mean ? " Yanking open his belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hand cupped his testicles . A sunbeam bathed them in hairless aura . " I 'll put them on your desk and you can step on them . Smash them with your tele-phone . " " No. no , " a voice moaned . It was my own . Annoyance flickered across McKenzie 's face . He turned his head a quarter turn in my direction . " It 's not necessary , " he said . Mac 's head remained at that angle , half-profiled , as Dust Krosley said , " Here 's your chance . " The balls moved forward and at his angle McKenzie could see them from the corner of his eye , settling on his desk . On McKenzie 's face there was a registration of Krosley closing in on him again , flickerings of butterflies dancing in the little muscles of Mac 's eyebrows and along his cheek-line . That glow again , beneath the tan . There was a blur of something soft and fleshy slapping McKenzie across the neck . A second camera would have caught it clearly . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of Dust Krosley backing away . Dust pulls up his pants , stands holding the halves of his unzippered fly . He , too , is in shock . The walls of the room shimmer like the bottom of a swimming pool . McKenzie rolls his eyes . instinctively looking for a focus . A photo on the wall resolves itself : the internationally known director receiving an award at Lucerne . Mac 's face clarifies , sharpens . " For God 's sake , get your pants together ! " The words rasp in Mac 's throat and he breaks out coughing . " For you , " Dust repeats . He zips up his pants . He opens his mouth again but there is nothing more to say . The air goes out of him with a whoosh . He resumes normal size . He sits . He wipes his knobby forehead with the sleeve of his charcoal jacket . The phone rings unevenly . " I broke my balls for you , " croaks Krosley , as if a gear had slipped one final turn and tripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting more . " Why . Dust ? Why did you ? " " I do n't know . " Dust 's voice is high and dreamy , like a sad small boy 's . " I wanted to make a real movie . " McKenzie 's forearm jerks along his neck , rubbing warmth into a stripe of cold . He rises , pulling the parts of himself together , stands once more by the window . " I thought he 'd help , " Dust said . " I kind of liked him . " " I do n't know how you do it , " Mac 's voice came . " I would n't be a screenwriter for all the tea in China . " From my corner angle through the window I caught this time the shaded end of his Maserati . It was then Mac must have known he 'd get another one to drive , leave the candy flake in front of his house , have his gaffer rig a spotlight for night . Dust found a few concluding words , which he spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Is n't it ? " " It is n't anyone 's fault , " I told him . " That 's right , " said McKenzie 's voice . " It 's nothing personal . " Dust gathered up the tacky briefcase he had carried all his life . He shuffled to the door like an old schoolteacher . McKenzie stepped right behind him , towering over him to prevent a reentry . At the door , Dust turned . I caught a fragment of his mouth and one eye as he peered up at McKenzie . " Maybe , " Dust whined , " when you 're through with the Newman picture ... " McKenzie took Dust 's limp arm and propelled him out the door . McKenzie 's voice rolled in from the outer office . " Well , old Dust , you got paid sixty thou-sand ! " Dust 's answer faded like the whisper of a falling leaf . " I did n't do it for the money . " Mac closed the door and stepped back in the office . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll never make it , Parker , " he said to me . Mac opened the fridge under his desk and took his noon vitamins with grapefruit juice . " l 'm going for my workout and a sauna , " he said . " The poor ignorant paranoid ass-hole ! " " Ai n't it the truth , " my voice replied . " They 're all the same . " I saw my boss take up his hat and his soft driving gloves . " Work up your notes on the rodeo rewrite and look ' em over on the plane . Have Judi call Newman 's secretary and find out the limo contact for the Maui airport . I 'm gon na have to go out and watch Paul 's deep-sea number and listen to his tapes and spend the goddamn weekend rubbing my nose in his rosy ass . " Then I saw that glow buzz in his cheeks and he started for the door with the glow still buzzing , but one final thought stopped McKenzie in his tracks . " Life is horseshit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his exit . " Not life , " murmured my own dear voice , drowned in applause as the credits rolled .
