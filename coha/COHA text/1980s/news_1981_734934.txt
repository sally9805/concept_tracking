Chicago Tribune Press Service HOUSTON  --  Those widely advertised breakfast sticks and powdered imitation orange drinks that are nearly ' synonymous with America 's manned space program have given way to sausage , eggs , corn ' flakes , and cocoa on Columbia 's first mission . Even though the , galley planned for the shuttle has not yet been installed , John Young and Robert Crippen can still enjoy hot meals , thanks to a portable warming device that looks like a briefcase . " We 're trying to get the food as natural as possible , , said Rita Rapp , a physiologist in charge of food selection for the manned space program . " We 're including peanuts instead of peanut cubes , and graham crackers instead of cubes . " ON THE ' APOLLO flights to the moon , the astronauts had to eat foods at room temperature , Rapp said , so the food selection was limited . Skylab astronauts often complained that all their food was bland , so nutritionists in the test kitchens of the National Aeronautics and Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you squeeze food from a tube into your mouth , you do n't smell it , so it seems bland , " Rapp said . " Also , some of the astronauts had congestion in their heads , which also limits taste . " Food ? aboard the shuttle flights will be stored in new types of containers that keep it fresh in a vacuum seal even at . ( the 100 degrees Fahrenheit expected in the pantry next to the ship 's electronic control system . " WE 'VE DEVELOPED new foil packages to replace cans so that the food may be heated quickly at a high temperature without tasting overcooked , " Rapp said . The first meal aboard Columbia will be turkey sandwiches , which the astronauts will carry in pockets of their flight suits . We thought they might get huhgry while at the controls but not have time to go down to the lower deck to prepare something , " she said . That smacks of John Young 's famous " corned beef caper " 15 years ago when he took an unauthorized corned beef sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young 's sandwich because it was from unknown sources , " Rapp recalled . " We were worried about possible food poisoning . " NASA nutritionists are developing special food trays that would hold a sandwich together so the crew members can set down their sandwiches in zero gravity without having the bread and meat float away from each other . Mustard and mayonnaise are no problem because surface tension holds them to the bread . " One thing we learned from John Glenn 's flight , " Rapp said , " is that any , thing you ' can get into your mouth , you can eat . " THE COLUMBIA 'S pantry , which will include corned beef , rye bread , and a variety of condiments , includes 50 different types of food , from applesauce to turkey tetrazzini , and shrimp cocktail to . rice pilaf. . - Once shuttle flights begin ' carrying crews to perform experiments , NASA will provide scheduled menus , much like a commercial airline , but crew members will also have the option of raiding the pantry for snacks . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all are shipped as powders with the water to be added as needed . The crew 's Water supply wilt come from the water produced as a product of the combustion of liquid hydrogen , which powers the shuttle . " WE THINK WE 'RE probably going to end up gaining weight on the flight , " Crippen said a few weeks before he and Young left Houston for Florida and liftoff.advanced considerably since T epe the early days where you had this toothpaste tube and squeezed some glop out of it to eat . " I Escape measures for . space shuttle crews 1 . Before the shuttle 's three main engines are fired , the crew can leave the cockpit for a platform 195 feet above ground , then get into any of five baskets . The basket will slide down a 1,200-foot  --  long wire to a concrete bunker on the ground . Then the astronauts either enter the bunker or get in an armored vehicle and drive to safety . 2 . After the rocket boosters have been Ignited but while the shuttle Is still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottoms of their seats . The shuttle is standing on end ; so the astronauts would be ejected horizontally , only 150 feet off the ground . Their parachutes probably would not open , and their chance of survival would be only 50 per cent . 3 . Once the Columbia clears the launch ower , the crew can eject any time until they reach 100,000 feet . Beyond that , they will not have enough oxygen in their tanks to survive In the rarefied atri osphere. 4 . At four minutes and 35 seconds into the launch , and before they reach orbit about 4 minutes later , the Columbia can return to a long runway at Kennedy Space Center . abort making one 5 . The shuttle can a revolution of the earth , landing at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico or at any of four other strips that Columbia 's computers are programmed to land at . 6 . In an extreme emergency , the shuttle can land at almost any airport in the world that has a runway at least 12,000 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle at the new landing site . 7 . During reentry , the astronauts can not eject until they return to 100,000 feet . Higher than that they will burn ? in the atmosphere .
