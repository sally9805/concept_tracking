txt  | Any marriage is a chain of experience that is embedded in a still longer development of an entire life span . Too often the literature on marriage starts with the experience of courtship or marriage itself , as if the time before then is insignificant in structuring the ensuing marriage . " The marital status involves a separation from what went before , " writes Joan Aldous.1 Can this be true ? Have we not learned anything prior to our courtship about how to be married ? Do we not extend the past into the future at least as much as we separate from it ? In fact my data suggest that for most people the important learning ( and for some people the only learning ) about being married has been gained long before any serious courtship . It is true that people sometimes manage to unlearn their premarital training ; nevertheless , any marriage is necessarily built on the past . It is the coming together of two unfolding life-patterns that already have their own biographically shaped tendencies ? tendencies that lead each partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most desired direction . And of all the legacies that bear upon the chosen direction of this unfolding , none is more important than a person 's family of origin . Marital Socialization Our foremost marriage teachers are our parents , not so much through what they say as through what they do . Our earliest images and concepts about marriage are formed in reaction to them , as we watch them enjoy or struggle through their own marriages , or move in and out of them , or perhaps strive to do without marriage altogether . Their marriage is almost always the first marriage we ever witness , and most often it is the only one prior to our own that we witness pretty much as insiders . All children know more , see more , hear more , and feel more than their parents would ever dream they do . A woman speaks of her parents :  | My father had a good job and led a highly social life , and my mother stayed at home , because she was n't at all that way . It led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times with different ladies . his was known to you and your mother ? It was known to me because of the fights I used to lay in bed and listen to them having . No other way would I have known . Maybe I was just nosy , or maybe I listened too much . At times they had terrific fights . Another woman , Carla Dean , speaks of a growing gap between her parents , and she relates her unspoken knowledge about how her mother dealt ' ith it : She spent a great deal of time lying on the couch , or talking on the telephone . I ca n't help but feel very strongly that my mother had fantasies about some of the men she met . I 'm sure neither she nor my father ever went outside of their marriage , but I even know who a couple of the men are . Mother never discussed any of her frustrations with us . Once in a while she 'd cry , and she 'd try to explain it , but she tried to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets in her fantasy world . Ias she ever admitted these fantasies ? How do you know she had them-ituitively ? Yes , and the way that mother acted . Because I 've had a couple of this type of fantasy thing during my own marriage , and I recognize it . And things she 'd say , also . When you talk about somebody that you 're having a fantasy about you sort of describe them in very glowing terms . " Mother never discussed any of her frustrations with us , " nor , resumably , her fantasies ; yet her daughter Carla clearly sensed them , knew bout them , and has thought about them . She may even have unwittingly ( ) pied her mother 's model for dealing with frustrr ' tion when , years later , she ) und herself likewise struggling on occasion with persistent fantasies about ther men . In one such period , Carla had been married for four years . She had wo small children ; her husband Jerry was engrossed i is work , and she was : cling lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nd children . Carla began to go alone to a couple 's group t her church : The minister convinced me that he could help me with all my problems . He paid a lot of attention to me , and I was flattered by it , I 'm sure . I asked for a pastoral call , and he made a pass at me which I repelled . But after about three days I called him up and told him I was sorry I had been rude . . . . It was about 9S percent on the telephone , and it lasted about a year . I looked  | forward to the telephone call that came usually around ten every morning , and it seemed like the bright spot of my whole day . And then I would take the kids out into the front yard in the afternoon and he would drive by and I 'd chat with him . Notice how in this account , Carla 's awareness of her mother 's fantasies must span a long period of time . She " recognizes " something her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later going through the same experience herself . Over and over again I heard stories demonstrating that as we make our way through a marriage , we continue to interact with our parents ' model , the most important one we know . Even years into our own marriage , we still evaluate our parents and how they lived , as if we can only locate where we stand in relation to them . Here is a woman married fourteen years , describing her mother and then her parents ' relationship : Her personality is such that she tends to play the role of the martyr and Goody Two-Shoes . Any infraction of the rules and she was ready for a lecture . . . . I never could find out what their relationship was . I still have n't figured it out . The only thing I can think of is they thrive on discord . I guess some people do ! I 've begun to realize that . Being away for eleven years , it was kind of nice to ignore the whole situation , and now I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hides the candy so that he can go find it , and he 's diabetic so he 's not supposed to eat it , so she will lecture at him that he 's not supposed to eat it , but why does she bring it in the house in the first place ? That 's why I think they thrive on discord . Clearly , this woman has figured out more than she gives herself credit for , and while the parental model that she sees is not one she wishes to repeat , it is nevertheless her point of departure . Our parents neither cause nor determine our marriages , to be sure . But our experience in and around their households is already part of our unfolding life-pattern , and any later development we go through as a married person must necessarily build on that experience . Marital Paradigms It is useful to think of our premarital notions about married life as forming a paradigm . Thomas Kuhn writes that a scientific paradigm is a set of rules and standards for " normal " scientific practice . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , I define a marital paradigm as a set of procedures for " normal " marriage practice , complete with a vision of model problems and their typical solutions . Our marital paradigm is the picture , the set of images we have formed about how marriage practice might he or seems to he done , for better or worse .  | Such paradigms are formed as a consequence of two kinds of experience . rst , even before we learn to speak we have already become well-practiced at irtnership through our own relationship with one or both parents . Child ) od and adolescence are like arranged marriages insofar as we are thrust into irtnerships that we have no recollection of choosing . Once embedded in lese minor " marriages " to our parents , we gain some initial practice at struciring the triangular arrangement of personal space referred to earlier . That , we attempt to preserve the integrity of our own inner-corner and its inrnal drama , to maintain a viable partnership-corner with one or two irents , and to carve out a variety of third-corner interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt goes roughly or smoothly , these early " marages " leave us with powerful imagery , upon which we abundantly draw ter when we structure our " real " marriages . The other source of our marital paradigms , mediated to us through our parents ' example with each other , was described in the previous section . either paradigm source ? our own relationship with our parents or their iarital partnership with each other ? results in any final set of images . From birth on , our marital paradigms are refined , revised , or transformed in the ght of whatever subsequent experience we gather . By the time we approach to age when we marry , our paradigmatic images are vigorously stamping ieir imprint on the kind of reality with an intimate partner that we are open experiencing . In order to uncover my respondents ' familiar paradigms , early in the inIrviews I asked them a set of open-ended questions about their childhood rid about their parents ' marriages . I began by querying , " How do you : member your childhood , " followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage ? " , questions that allowed them to express some of their images f partnership with minimal interference and predefinition from me . Whatver they said that seemed to be of significance to them , I followed up with irther probing questions , inviting them to clarify it further , tell me more bout the surrounding context , talk about the way they felt about it at the time , nd so forth . Even when this line of questioning had produced an abundance of iaterial , I still asked at least two more companion questions about their : vents , probing their answers for still more det il : " Was there anything in our parents ' marriage you were determined not t repeat in your own , " and Was there anything in their marriage you were eage , to repeat in your own ? " The responses I got ran the gamut of feeling and r ction . Marital paraigms are a composite of a wide variety of images , s ' e positive , some native . and some neutral . Premarital life experience is rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , so each person 's aradIKm will usually reflect this variety of elements . Nevertheless , most peoIc tither have a onscious , overall feeling about what they already know brut partnership , or at least they have a tendency to attend to one or a few  | dominating elements of their familiar paradigm . Specifically , some people are inclined to embrace the paradigm , some reject the paradigm , others are not consciously aware of it and hence invariably fall into the paradigm , still others approach/avoid certain paradigm elements , and finally , some transform the paradigm . These standpoints may change in the course of a person 's marital career . For example , many people who begin by rejecting key paradigmatic images find themselves falling into that pattern later on . And many who begin without conscious knowledge of any pattern wind up eventually becoming aware of it and then transforming it . Whatever respondents could tell me about their childhood and their parents must surely be like the tip of an iceberg : the known and visible tip of course affects them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact . Of course , some respondents managed to become excellent " divers , " determined to fathom more and more of the hidden territory . Others seemed to steer their awareness clear of both the tip and the drama below , and accordingly they found little to tell me . Fortunately for this study , these latter people were a tiny minority of those I interviewed . I am soundly convinced that regardless of what people think they are doing in their marriages , the path of least resistance is to fall back into many elements of their familiar paradigms , repeating what they have already seen or done , and usually doing so without much awareness of it . As an analogy , consider embarking on winter driving trips from driveways with well-worn grooves , left in the ice and snow by those who have gone before you . You can " embrace " the grooves and try to ease your way through them . If they still work , all well and good . But your wheels may not be able to maintain their grip on the hardened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or get stuck . You must then try to " reject " the grooves , but it often happens that the harder you try to get out of them , the more deeply you seem to fall into them ; the gravity of the groove keeps on pulling you back in . It may then require some special finesse to get yourself out . Parents can not help but leave their imprint , and all children must to some extent negotiate the pathways forged by their parents . Indeed , it is quite striking how people often seem to select the very partners who will swiftly jerk them right back into the grooves of the familiar paradigm , despite the fact that this return may be very painful . It is as if people want to re-experience any pain from their earlier development that they were unable to surmount , as if , in embracing that pain still another time , they have the chance of finally transcending it . Lyle and Kathy Remick , married for eighteen years when I interviewed them , both seemed to fall back into painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide us with an initial opportunity to see how the process works . I.yle 's parents split up when he was thirteen , and he recalls his family life before then as a " stormy time . Barricaded doors , I can  | : member , and pounding on doors and screaming and yelling . Really quite a . aumatic time . " Kathy 's parents remained together , but their marriage was o more enviable than I.yle 's parents ' . Kathy recalls " terrible scenes . At four the morning we 'd all be up crying , that kind of thing . " She remembers her it her as : moody and disagreeable , a perfectionist .... I can remember when we were little and he 'd take us for walks , and if we did n't all behave , which we never did , we were in for trouble . You could never relax around him or just be yourself . Everything was really regimented . Christmas morning we all had to get up and get dressed , line up at the head of the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he had this image of what a perfect family should he and was trying to whip us all into it , but it never worked . . . . I think he would blame me and say things were my fault . He would say negative things to me anyway . lie thought I was a lot like he was , and that if he would just criticize me enough , I 'd shape up and be something better . Jot surprisingly , Kathy emerged from her youth feeling that " everybody else , ' as better than I was . I wanted somebody to love me , but I did n't think it was ossible . " Whereas Kathy 's father had an image of a perfect daughter , an image that : athy always failed , Lyle came to marriage with an image of a perfect wife . " I kink I fantasized about having some ideal woman who was going to be a ompanion , " Lyle recalls : Someone who was poetic , outdoorsy but at the same time pink , light , and feminine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her with him , and they were in this sloop , and she was in an oil slicker and he was in an oil slicker , and they were bending over , looking over a chart , and the look of equalness , of companionship , and the capability and femininity at the same time , and the complete mating of male and female but also a real genuine friend type relationship in the world of the outdoors . That struck me very much , and I thought Kathy was like that . . . . I have always been capable of using my imagination to create the world as I want it to be . I think I did bring in preconceptions to the marriage . I look at a person and I see something , and that does n't mean that it 's there . I probably did that with my wife ; I probably envisioned her as being what I wanted her to be . The stage is thus set . Lyle retreats from his un mfortable everyday life nd his mistrust of marriage into the fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to love her as she s , but she feels destined to atl at marriage because who she is has always , eemed defective . Together , ley hook caLh other right into the most pail ttl grooves of their familiar , tradigm . Kathy tells the story of their meetyng :  | I can remember the first time I saw Lyle , and it 's very interesting . We worked at American Airlines . I was sitting in the lunchroom one day . Lyle came in and I noticed him , and he had a very unhappy look on his face , and he was very intriguing to me . Physically , he fit my image of what I liked in a man , but it was mainly this expression in his face that appealed to me , and I feel now it was at a preconscious level . My father was never happy , and I could never do anything to make him happy ; there 's a chance for me to try again . Maybe if he 'd come in with a sunny smile on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the ensuing eighteen years , Kathy once more fails at making the man in her life happy , and Lyle finds that the reality of married life repeatedly fails to measure up to his fantasy of it . They quickly fall back into the " terrible scenes " that both recall in their parents ' marriages . Lyle speaks of a loss of self-respect in the midst of these battles : The arguments remind me of my youth , and I 'm thinking , " I do n't need this all over again . " And at those times I 'm thinking about splitting or being an independent person , where you come home at night and you 've got a quiet place with the clock ticking , and you can read a book , and you can have a glass of sherry if you want . You have at least the decency of being a member of the human race . Whereas when you 're having these arguments , you reduce yourself to nothing . Again , a marital paradigm is a collection of images that describe pathways through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how those pathways might be travelled . While the content of all these images is tremendously varied from one person 's paradigm to another 's , I find that there are a limited array of issues that lend structure to these diverse contents . Generally speaking , marital paradigms portray attempted solutions to issues of bonding and individuating . In triangle terms , marital paradigms depict strategies for managing all three corners ? the inner self , the partnershipcorner , and the various third-corners . In the remainder of this chapter , I shall document ways in which each of the three corners is formed , and indicate some of the typical issues upon which they center . First-Corner Issues Like all people , parents have inner selves that are laden with feelings of comfort or fear , stability or insecurity , potency or powerlessness , adequacy or worthlessness , with all shadings of gray in between these and other inner polarities . Because parents so often see their own marriages as opportunities to actualize their inner strivings , they can not help but transmit these urgencies  | their children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five ears old and has been married for twenty-nine years . She is the woman of hapter 1 who in earlier periods of her marriage repeated her mother 's patTn of extramarital fantasies , acted out largely via the telephone . ' hroughout her life , securing a sense of personal adequacy and social reDectability has been a major theme , overlaid by fantasies of glory and adoraon . It is easy to see the origins of these inner-corner issues and their inuence on Carla 's choice of her mate , Jerry : My mother had a queen complex . She had always dreamed of living in a really nice home . We did have a nice home , but it was n't elegant , and my mother had always wanted that kind of life . She never discussed things with us , never really helped us to grow up and face life , and face limitations and reality . . . . Mother never allowed us to have our school friends in the house , and she always talked so reverently , almost , about the wealthy " 400 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt inadequate . Carla had three sisters . We did n't go to Mountcrest School ? at this time it was very elite , and Mother kind of worshipped that kind of thing . We got from her the desire for elegance . . . . When I worked for my father , I had to answer the telephone a lot , and many of the people who ordered things were people that Mother thought so highly of , monied people , and I just dreamed that I would be one of them . I used to envy those people ; they sounded so cozy ... . My mother was not a good housekeeper at all , and we did almost all of the work that was done around that house , and Mother would be on the couch , and she 'd look at Good Housekeeping magazines and dream . When my grandmother was there it was as if somebody had waved a magic wand ; within half an hour of the time she came , the house was neat , and you felt as though things were in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Carla 's mother focussed only on the silver-lined side of life and resented everyday reality as tarnished , Carla 's father carried on about the ark clouds : My father twice a year would talk to us in the evening . It took the whole evening . He would never say " boo " to us between these tirades . He would spend the whole evening warning us about the perils of the big old bad world out there , and also the dangers of spending ten dollars when you only have five , and we 'd always invariably wind the evening up with all of us in tears , including Mother , and Dad would be in the middle of the floor on his knees pounding on the floor to make his point . ( ; rowing up with these prominent images , it is not surprising that Carla ell into her mother 's style of fantasy to bolster up her inadequate self and her , loamy , unacceptable everyday world . After hihkr school and a failed romance , she yearned to become a singer :  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being adored by all these fans . I just could n't face normal humdrum living . I tried desperately to adjust , and I joined the YWCA and played badminton and volleyball and softball . I did some sewing . I was just so intent on " adjusting . " Jerry was the first one who made life seem exciting to me at all . And we both had dreams of having a big home like this . He used to work for my father as a delivery boy just so he could be near me . Making deliveries to these mansions , he just made up his mind he was going to have a mansion like that . Jerry not only fed Carla 's fantasies but fueled them with some of his own . Carla relates : I inherited some of my mother 's queen complex , and Jerry has always made me feel like a queen . To this day he tells me I have no faults . He is so accepting of me , and I feel so unaccepted outside of the home , usually . Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter what I do , what kind of mood I 'm in . No matter how sick I am , Jerry 's always made me feel very beloved . Carla 's account reminds us that the inner-corner is in part a dialogue between our own impulses and the messages about ourselves and the world received from significant others . It is not completely clear how Carla 's mother transmitted her own sense of inadequacy and her yearnings for social recognition to her daughters ; what we know is that somehow , these urgencies become Carla 's urgencies , in large part constituting her private drama and shaping her need for a particular kind of partner . For some respondents , inner-corner issues arose not from adopting their parents ' urgencies , as Carla did , but from striving to escape the difficulties of their own partnership with one or both parents . Brenda Davis is one such respondent . Her mother divorced her father when Brenda was ten , and remarried a man who was violent . Brenda recalls her ensuing home life as " turbulent " : While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very strange childhood . He did n't drink , but he 'd get violent every once in a while , and he 'd cause an uproar , and we had to live through that . He did n't hit me too often , just a couple of times . He 'd throw things , he 'd be destructive . I can remember his chasing me with a gun once . He 'd threaten a lot of the times and he would n't do anything , but he 'd do it to scare her , to get at her . He used us or anything else that he thought she cared about . Like if there was any furniture that he thought she liked , he 'd destroy it . For Brenda , there were two dominating inner-corner issues . The first was a lack of basic safety . Filled with paradigmatic images of how a violent partner can ruin a family , she focussed her marital sights on " someone who would he quiet . I did n't want it to be anything like my mother 's marriage to Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet ' would mean in a marriage . What it meant to ne was no arguing , no fighting . And I always said I 'd never get a divorce . It vas so hard growing up with Gene , and so I said I would never get a divorce Ind put my kids through all that . " The other inner-corner issue plaguing Brenda was a lack of any real sense ) f adequacy and efficacy , an issue that arose more from her relationship with ter mother than from her stepfather 's destructive influence . She recalls her pother as " the dominant one in the family " while she was married to 3renda 's natural father . Early on , Brenda must have learned to deal with her nother 's criticism by conducting herself outwardly in a manner beyond re ) roach and by inwardly hiding her real feelings about things . These tenden:ies have become clearer to Brenda because she sometimes re-enacts this irama with her own daughter Allison : When I get angry it 's almost like Allison tunes me out , and she wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to do things like that .... I remember so much about my mother that I did n't like . Like this look that she has , this disgusted look , when people are n't doing what she thinks they should be doing . . . . My mother did n't want me to marry Glen , and I married him anyway . She said , " He 's not right for you ; you 're not going to be happy , " and I was going to prove her wrong . So even though I was unhappy in my marriage , I would n't have left for the world emphasis added . Not only did Brenda stay in an unhappy marriage for seventeen years ) efore getting a divorce , but even throughout her four-year courtship with 1len , she knew that her basic emotional needs were not being met . I often wondered why we ever got married . He never treated me special . He was never on time ; he never paid me a compliment . He never acted like he really cared whether I was around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to allow that to go on and marry a person that I got so little from emotionally . He never built me up or encouraged me . It was like he found every opportunity to put me down . I think he was insecure and he did n't want me to feel good about myself because then he could n't feel superior in any way , and I might realize that I did n't need him . If I expressed any particular like , he 'd find a way to put that down . What kind of need did Brenda have to enter a marriage based on such an msatisfying courtship ? When we look closely at her account , what appears o he an irrational mate-choice had a certain rationality to it , geared to filling he two gaps in her inner-corner . On one hand she could finally feel safe , ' way from the torments of her stepfather : " It was had at home , and I just ' ceded someplace to belong . I knew Glen well enough to know that he was n't iolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was quiet . " On the  | other hand , she could feel more adequate and competent away from the critical scrutiny of her mother : " He did n't ask anything of me . I did n't feel put on the spot , or I did n't think he 'd make any demands that I could n't fulfill . Even though emotionally he was n't good for me and he put me down , I could do what I wanted around the home ; he 'd allow me to take charge of the home . I think the attraction was more the home than him ? to belong somewhere . " Of course , the initial vision proved much better than the reality , and Brenda could not seem to avoid falling back into paradigm elements relating to her inner sense of inadequacy that was reminiscent of her failure to meet her mother 's expectations : " Glen put me down all the time . If there was dust on the floor , or the way I said something ? I always felt like I never quite measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everything better all the time , to get to some ideal place where people could n't find any wrong at all . " In summary , the inner-corner may come to focus on such needs as basic safety and minimal comfort , but above all else it is a set of strivings based on our vision of personal adequacy . That vision may differ for males and females . In a patriarchal setting female adequacy will often center around attractiveness and desirability , on caring for others and being attuned to their needs , or on being tidy , responsible , and accommodating . Male adequacy will more often focus on independence , on ability to comnand others ' allegiance , on task competence , and on being decisive , cool , and in full control . While these respective emphases pervade and largely constitute patriarchal culture , they can only start constituting the person insofar as they are mediated to us through watching and interacting with our most significant early partners , especially parents . And once these inner-corner strivings ( or perhaps our rejection of them ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships can not help but reflect them , as we saw with both Carla Dean and Brenda Davis . Second-Corner Issues Often , there is no hard and fast line between inner-corner and partnershipcorner imagery . Does our sense of adequacy and competence belong to our inner-self , or to the kind of affirmation we are used to receiving from intimate partners ? Our images can focus on the issue from either direction or from both . Is a sense of safety and security an inner-corner issue , or does it relate more to a strong history of comfort in the company of others ? Because intimate patnerships stand so close to our inner core , it is not always easy to separate the one from the other . Nevertheless , I shall treat them as separable for the sake of analytical clarity . As with the inner-corner , partnership-corner images may be summarized as a set of implicit polarities . I lere , the issues stem to he attachment and belonging  | to someone versus aloneness or abandonment ; love and affection versus coldness or aloofness ; peace and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making ; availability and active companionship versus inaccessibility . Marital paradigms are filled with such images about partnership interaction , and again , these images are primarily remnants of what our parents modeled with each other and of our own partnerships with one or both parents or parental surrogates . Attachment Perhaps the most basic second-corner image has to do with attachment versus abandonment . Many respondents recounted a strong sense of secure connection in their family of origin , a feeling that their parents would always unquestionably be there for them and for each other . These respondents did not specifically refer to " belonging " per se , having always taken that for granted . Typically , they singled out a feeling of closeness . " My parents always appeared to derive a lot of satisfaction and comfort from that close relationship , " a thirty-three-year-old man told me . He added , " I saw the sharing that they had together as very important in marriage . They were both even-tempered and got along extremely well together . I enjoy my parents ' company . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this security in belonging . Rejecting some painful paradigm images , they told stories that focussed on aloneness or abandonment . A woman expressed this theme of abandonment in terms of parenting : It was super-important to me to marry someone I could depend on in terms of parenting with me , because I knew I wanted children . I did n't want a man who would leave when I was pregnant . My natural father deserted my mother when she was pregnant with me . I had all kinds of irrational anxieties with each of my own pregnancies , because I 've never really worked all that through . Another woman , Angela , spoke of her father 's navy career and eventual divorce from her mother : Even before their separation and divorce he was gone most of the time ; he was us y aboard ship . We always stayed home . I 've never had a relationship ith my father , and that is something that I have really missed . I got mar ' ed with the idea that I would never get a divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand it more than I did then , because when you 're a kid y , do n't ever expect your mother and father to split up . And I think it 's an , iwful blow when they do .... My childhood is something that I want to / ' forget . My mother had to work , for one thing . I used to come home from ghoul and there was nobody there , which I swore would never happen to  | my kids . Whenever I seemed to need somebody or wanted somebody , they were never there . I had nobody to really turn to . Angela married Joe after a four-year courtship , and following a one-weel honeymoon , Joe went overseas with the army . Familiar paradigm images o abandonment then came back to haunt Angela , who spoke of the ordeal o. the ensuing two years : I felt very , very lonely while he was gone . I do n't know if I 'd do that all over again . It was a very lonely time . And there again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't there . I did n't blame him , I just felt like , all my life it 's been that way . I was frightened of being alone , because I felt like I was the only person in the world . In general , when respondents came to marriage with a strong history of security-in-belonging , their partnership-corner imagery reflects an eagerness to share their life with another adult with whom they can recreate that comfortable closeness . When they came , like Angela , with considerable fears of being abandoned , their approach to partnership is more protective . They somehow manage to recreate the very circumstances that perpetuate their fears , often choosing a partner whose third-corner management is most likely to provoke anxieties that are all too familiar . Affection When parents give their children abundant affection and show it for each other , their children form some of their most vivid and powerful images of partnership . Many of my respondents fondly embraced these familiar images , carrying them into their own partnership-corner : My parents are still very loving , and I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in from the hayfield and put his arms around her , and I remember saying to myself , " That 's just the kind of husband I want . " I guess you 'd have to know my dad . He just gets a thrill and a kick out of life , and he was always like that ? a great joker and a teaser , and that 's the way I remember him with my mother . . . . Every idea I had of marriage I learned from my parents . I think I figured all marriages were happy like that , and that would just come automatically . I could n't imagine not being happy . Forty-threeyear-old woman , married twenty-two years Even when respondents chronicle some deep-rooted disturbances in their parents ' marriage , they still recall whatever episodes of affection and levity were there . Carla Dean , who told me that her mother was quite unhappy in her marriage and that her parents grew farther and farther apart , nevertheless remembers some affectionate moments that seemed to make a strong impact on her : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father used to go over and play with her breasts , and t hat always made me feel good . She 'd giggle and say , " Oh George , stop , in from of the kids ! " and this and that .... There was kissing . He never went to work without kissing her goodbye . Up to a certain age he used to kiss us goodbye every day , and mother never went anywhere without doing the rounds .... They would invite their friends to come over Sunday with their families for a big dinner , and they 'd stay the afternoon and then we 'd all go to bed , and we i ould hear the parents downstairs laughing and giggling . But when these fatuities , friends , would leave , almost always my father would put his arm around my mot her 's udder and they 'd stand together like that until the people went . It was jovial . A number of respondents dill not have even these ephemeral episodes of affection in their paradigmatic imagery . Some of them , like Bonnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and early on they decided that their own marriage and child rearing would be different . Bonnie told me : My parents lived very separate lives . They did n't have any communication at all that I can ever remember . My father never really listened ? to her , the kids , anybody . I wanted someone who would be gentle to me , and not be afraid to show his love , and if we had children , who would n't be afraid to pick the kids up and take them someplace , or just hug them , or play with them . My father never played with us . And I never saw him hug and kiss my mother , never . . . . He was extremely , extremely strict . We always asked my mother , " Could we go to a dance ? " ; we never went to my father . And God forbid we should talk to him before he ate supper ! We would get our heads chopped off . Conflict Perhaps the most frightening images that people carry into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of origin . Many of the respondents who spoke most positively about their parents and their childhood mentioned the absence of overt conflicts in their homes . Here are two examples : I grew up in a very calm home situation . There was never an angry word , never a raised voice between my parents . So my assumption was that marriage was a calm , tranquil situation . Forty-four-year-old woman , married twenty-four years Everything just seemed to be so perfect . I can only remember my parents quarrelling once , and I do n't remember what it was about . I did n't realize that other people quarrelled , and I did n't realize that other people had problem .. I guess Ito+t lived a very sheltered life . So I carried that on into my own marriage . I I htrty-five-year-old woman , married fourteen years  | Not everyone who embraces their familiar paradigm does so by reference to an absence of quarrelling in the parents ' marriage . Here is a man whose model of marriage includes both closeness and some conflicts : My parents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family . We were very close ; there was a great deal of affection . There 's always been a lot of support over the years , and all three of us always felt very special in the eyes of our parents . We go down to visit them every year , and they used to come to Maine in the summer . . . . My mother is a very strong-willed person ; she 's domineering but very loving and supportive . Arguments were always a staple in our family ; there was anger expressed , but it was never destructive anger . In his own twenty-five-year marriage , this man has not needed to shy away from conflict , because his paradigm instructs him that one can quarrel vigorously and still have a good marriage . My wife and I both have strong ideas , and when they clash , the fireworks go . We 're volatile . The fireworks fly , but then they die very quickly . Sometimes we feel badly about having had a shouting match , but it ends quickly . Other respondents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes but without any positive , counterbalancing influences , became convinced that conflict in a marriage can only be destructive , and they intended their own marriages to be totally free of it . Frank O'Brien is one such respondent . As is often the case , the conflicts he remembers were aggravated by alcohol : It was a stormy household . My mother was an alcoholic of many years standing . There were a large number of tensions , alleviated by the fact that my father was n't home much . He was a periodic heavy drinker too . Being Roman Catholics , they 'd never consider divorce ; one got used to living with situations that were incurable . . . . I inherited the basic cultural set that marriage is final ; you work things out , period . Until I left my home community I 'd never met a divorced person . Divorce was something that happened in books and movies ; it did n't happen in our neighborhood . Fifty-two-year-old college professor , married twenty-seven years Fdled with images about the damaging impact of conflicts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have to be final , Frank was determined to avoid any semblance of confrontation . Courtship became a testing ground to verify that it would not happen . He told me , " The things that would he irritating would show up in courtship . That 's what courtship is for : finding out whether you can handle each other 's sharp edges . " Once  | married ( to a woman who grew up in a home that was totally devoid of expressed conflicts ) , Frank maintained a stance toward conflict that was consistent with his paradigm-inspired philosophy : Storminess occurs when one forces issues . I do n't force issues in my marriage . I do n't force a decision on a conflict . My wife does the same thing . Conflict can resolve itself if you leave it nebulous . It becomes irrelevant , or you gradually resolve it , but not through confrontation . Confrontation resulted in storms in my parents ' marriage , and there were a lot of confrontations . They never solved anything . Frank 's rejection of any conflict scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; revealing deep or unsettled feelings could hurl him back into that quarantined territory of marital struggle . Asked if he thought he and his wife Laura knew each other 's deepest strivings , he replied , " No , that 's what one loses when one does n't have confrontation . In confrontation one finds out the other 's deepest strivings . " Thus , when the death of a close friend threw Frank into an emotional crisis some fifteen years into his marriage , it never was talked about with Laura : I went through a couple of years of withdrawal . I went on Valium for a couple of years . Sexual withdrawal was part of it . There were relatively strong emotional changes . I do n't even know if Laura noticed them , but I think she did . She knew something was going on but she never pressed me about it . I guess we both figured it would work itself out , and it did . It was a two-year episode , at the end of which we began to get back to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Laura never asked and Frank never told , both honoring the implicit contract not to pry into each other 's inner-corner , making certain to preserve the peace and keep the demon conflict at bay . Power and Decision Making Even if parents do not model overt conflicts , marriage always raises issues of who decides what . Children form clear images of which parent led and which parent followed , of who was dominant and who was submissive , or of decision making as a shared enterprise , if that was the case . They themselves also participate in a power structure with one or both parents , an arrangement that usually generates strong feelings , sometimes positive , sometimes negative , but rarely neutral or indifferent . All of this gives rise to paradigms of marital power , which are among the most central of the second-corner image . to which people address themselves in structuring their own courtships and marriage ..  | Many of my male respondents had fathers whose presence was the dom nant one in the home . Where such patriarchal dominance remained uncoi tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their familiar paradigm images and expected that they would likewise be tl leading authority in their own marriage . As Paul Carter put it : There were very few arguments in my youth . My mother never talked back to my father , so I was definitely not expecting to have a female talk back . It was pretty much a man-is-head type marriage situation . Whatever was necessary for the man to get ahead , for the man to basically be happy was what was supposed to be the standard by which the family functioned . And the woman basically supported that . Forty-two-year-old electronics teacher , married twenty years It should not be thought , however , that men who grow up in a male-governe household embrace everything about this arrangement for their own ma riages . The rule here as elsewhere is a simple one : only those paradigm element that appear to work comfortably are adopted without much forethought Those elements that seem to work but also to produce some unseemly cons ( consequences are treated according to the perceived severity of the discomforts . Pec ple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , an they arrive at some prescriptive remedies which they intend to apply to thei own marriages and families to eliminate the discomforts . For example , respondent told me that his parents ' relationship was " very good . He was leader and she was a follower ; she was happy doing whatever he thought right . This man added , however , that while he " wanted the obvious relationship hi parents had , " he wanted a wife who was not quite as dependent as his mothe had been : " I know if he had made her more self-sufficient , it would have been great deal easier for her after he died . He would do the shopping because sh did n't want to do it , and simple things like that she should have been doing , sh just did n't have any inkling about at all " forty-eight-year-old store manager married thirteen years to second wife . Scott King is another respondent who describes these elements of patriarchy It was not an equal marriage . He made most of the decisions . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a checkbook even though they 'd been married twenty-six or twenty-seven years . When she worked , her money came home and went to him and he spent it . He was the one who made decisions . He bought most of the groceries and brought them home . He did n't stint her with money , and I 'm sure she was very , very happy . But he did make most of the decisions . Since there was little conflict in Scott 's home , and Scott felt well connected ti both parents , it might he expected that he would structure his own marriag ,  | along the lines of his familiar paradigm , adopting his father 's model of authority for himself and making only minor changes . The situation was far more complex , however , because while Scott 's working-class father was the unquestioned decision-making authority , his mother came from a different background and was the unspoken intellectual and cultural authority of the family ? an active reader , " a fairly accomplished musician , " a person with " a good deal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , in large part , Scott thinks , because he could not overcome his insecurities about his wife 's intellectual superiority : " That was a realm that he just did n't understand or know at all . It was difficult for him to know that she had a world that he could n't enter . I Ic must have feared that being so cultured , she could easily take over all the decision making , and then he 'd be left with nothing . In drinking , he could escape from all this . " While Scott was enough identified with his father to appreciate the privileges inherent in domestic power , he soon became even more identified with his mother 's intellectual world , so much so that he ultimately chose an academic career . In his own marriage he became more than willing to trade away domestic authority for active leadership in intellectual enterprises . Intellectual pursuits spelled danger , however , since in Scott 's familiar paradigm , friction in a marriage arises when only one partner has an intellectual life . His preventative medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only agree that intellectual authority might be assigned a higher value than domestic authority , not only be an eager and supportive " ground crew " for all the intellectual missions he might launch , but also be strong enough to stand on her own two feet intellectually and thus protect their marriage from the extreme intellectual inequality that plagued his parents . In his words , a satisfying marriage would be one : in which the female partner buoyed me up as I needed it much as his mother always had , a marriage that would have a high intellectual quality , a continuous intellectual quality . That was one thing I wanted that was different from my parents ' marriage . I did n't want that superior/inferior intellectual relationship that they had , because I thought that was the basis of some of their other problems Scott is a fifty-year-old-college professor , married for twenty-seven years . Those men who grew up in an uncomfortable patriarchy and had a negative or nonexistent relationship with their father became highly conscious and critical of their family 's power arrangements , rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depending on the circumstances , such a rejection can focus either on a husband/father being too tyrannical or a wife/mother being too weak or submissive . It can also focus on both , as it did in the case of Hal Stern , who describes his home life growing up near New York City :  | I remember my home as not a very friendly place . It was the kind of place where people came to do battle with one another , particularly at mealtimes . It was a constant kind of thing . Something was always in the air . My father was the protagonist always . He favored one of my older brothers and continually put down the other one . There was a lot of conflict between my father and my older sister too , and my mother always kind of played the role of trying to smooth things over . For me there was always a problem there in trying to fit in . I think I spent most of my time growing up avoiding conflict . I became very independent as a youngster and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . . . . It was an authoritarian family , and decisions always rested with my father . And I was determined not to provide that kind of a model in raising my own kids . I felt that a sense of fairness should be instilled in the family : for decisions that affect the family , people would have something to say about them on an equal level . So far , Hal 's account faults only his father and his autocratic tendencie Elsewhere , however , Hal focusses on his mother . He was close to her em ( tionally , and she was " more interesting intellectually than his father was ' he can remember having discussions with her . But she was likewise unable t protect her own space from her husband 's tumult and tension , and she woun up in a mental institution for many years . Hal was then left without an ally companion . Marriage came to mean " an image of security . It meant that would n't be alone anymore , that there would be somebody who I could tru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could share that trust an caring . " As much as Hal rejected his father 's model , he also faulted h mother for her contribution to their dominant ? subordinate pattern of ma riage . Had she not been so weak , she would have stood her ground with ht husband , and then Hal would have retained the emotional support that sly alone had to offer him . Asked what qualities he wanted in a mate , Hal replies : did n't want anybody who would fall over . I wanted somebody I could pre against emotionally as well as intellectually , somebody who would stand u and have some guts and say what they wanted to say and not be afraid of me. did n't want to duplicate my mother in the woman that I married . " Hal 's story brings out many complexities of how familiar paradigms len structure to a person 's inner-corner , with all its hidden drama and kaleidc scope of emotions . In one package Hal has organized not just his seconc corner images of power dynamics but also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . Having made a considered diagnosis c the ills of his parents and of his own childhood situation , he carries his it tended remedy into his marriage . But it took many years for Hal to mov significantly in the direction he wished . It proved a lot easier to fall into th familiar paradigm than to transform it . Alone and powerless to get his need met within his family of origin , it became all too tempting to pick a spous who would not offer too much resistance , who would at least back down i  | not " fall over , " who would let him dominate enough to secure his needs but would not become so dysfunctional ( like his mother ) that he would be left without a companion . In other words , it was easier to adopt his father 's stance of dominance than to trust that a wife 's strength , power , and love could be relied upon to make him feel secure . " Hal 's quite domineering , " his wife Paula says . " He figures what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say whether I thought I was right or not . " I lal himself concedes , " I always pressed my concerns and needs and what I wanted . " Still , Hal 's initial vision of a more equal marriage was never totally lost . Paula was eventually able to convince both herself and Hal that she did indeed have some valuable strengths . " I used to he more dependent on Hal . I think I was looking for somebody to take care of me . I 'm more independent now . I 'm more aggressive than I was . " For I IaI , Paula 's strength became more credible during a period when he and Paula lost three people who were close to them , including Hal 's mother . Perhaps her death was also the symbolic death of Hal 's fear of ultimate abandonment at the hands of a female , for it coincided with the emergence of his wife being unmistakably there for him to lean on : I was really feeling kind of lost . It was very hard for me to handle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having her continue to function made me feel good . I did n't have to carry the two of us , and we could share and somehow get through it . And so now when something happens that 's emotionally rending in the family , I feel a kind of confidence that we 'll be able to handle it together emphasis added . This new sense of emotional equality and trust apparently spilled over into the whole area of power dynamics , for Hal no longer has to push so hard to secure his own needs . " I 'm more able to listen to her concerns and feel that they 're as important as mine . Now , what she 's saying is equally important , and I listen and respond and show some caring . That was probably a major change for me as a person . " Paula seems to agree : " I do n't think he 's so bossy any more . I think he respects my feelings a little more . " Women are no less variable than men in their ways of forming images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reflect their level of comfort in their families of origin ? the goings-on between their parents as well as any leftover issues between themselves and their parents . Chodorow 's and Dinnerstein 's analyses suggest that males and females develop different approaches to power , notwithstanding the great variety of family issues that either gender may have experienced by the time of marriage . Because men as infants are originally bonded to and identified with a female , securing a masculine status eventually requires a vigorous assertion of independence from that relationship . To he sure , men still want the nurturance and support that they got from their mother ; nevertheless , with one eye fixed on their father 's third-corner independence , they cling fast to their hard-won freedom  | from a woman 's power , a power that once bent their will to female-defin purposes . If being nurtured comes only at the cost of a man 's freedom frc female domination , men are willing to do without the nurturance . Hal Ste could focus so much attention on a wife being strong enough to properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to initiate and rule matters of greatest importance to him . And Scott King could marry a stro woman who would take full charge of the domestic front because his sense power and authority was exclusively tied to his intellectual prowess , and knew that if push ever came to shove , his wife would subordinate her own d main of power to his . Patriarchy is the safest path for men , and female attac ment to a man 's apparent strength is the time-honored arrangement in whi. male independence from females is combined with nurturant female service As Dinnerstein notes , patriarchy is also the safest path for women , wl often stand ready and eager to take their place in this arrangement . Regar less of what they saw played out at home , female gender security does not r quire any wrenching apart from their earliest bond with their mother .

When mothers assume this stance of devoted service toward their hu bands , daughters form especially clear images of wifely attendance to a man needs . Norma Parker recalls that she and her siblings " were always seconi ary " to her mother 's relationship with her father and later her stepfathe " When my mother and father were communicating the children were shi out ; we were n't allowed in the.house when he came home from work so the could sit and have a drink . " Rather than fault her mother for neglecting he Norma idealized her , hoping to finally get her needs met in her adult life t likewise pleasing a man . I held my mother in high esteem all through my childhood , and looked to her as a model of the perfect wife . She was always willing to give in and do what her husband wanted ? which I certainly changed my mind about . I think that was the downfall of her first marriage . For instance , he 'd say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd dye her hair blond . It never was good enough . She tried to be what he wanted , sexually or whatever . I saw that as a good and noble characteristic and modeled myself after her . She continues to do that sort of thing with her second husband . She has very good qualities . Though Norma always tried to please her own husband Bud , in the fir ! five years of their marriage his professional insecurities often left him depresse and ill-humored . Norma felt resentful ; a man is supposed to be strong an decisive , and if something goes wrong in his life , a wife is supposed to mak  | r him . By paradigmatic rule , a man who is not pleased must not be ith her : se days it put a heavy blanket over everything . He would grump and loors , and sometimes cry .

Not idealization but opposition or fear is then ern of response to her , and fathers sometimes get pulled in ( or rush he vacuum . To be sure , if fathers are accessible and congenial , both girls will tend to shift their allegiance to them , given aggravated ith their mothers , but there are important differences .

" ' Since , therefore , he " has never presented himself to her same force as her mother , " ' he " does not serve as a sufficiently imhject to break her maternal attachment . " ' Of course , he can start arrer of pleasing men . Fathers often see their daughters as darling and encourage them to cultivate a seductive female selfhood .

Comfort may soothe a daughter , but it does not solve her problem of ntr female identity . In her heart she would still like to authenticate convincing Mom that she is really okay .  | In short , girls find it extremely difficult to differentiate themselves from a critical mother 's expectations . While a boy has the luxury of escaping an overly critical mother by hastening into his masculine oppositeness from her , a girl who would distance too far from her mother 's scrutinizing eye is in danger of losing the only concrete vision of adequate female personhood she knows . Small wonder that young women with a history of struggle with their n thers often pin their hopes on a strong man who will love them , lead them , guide them and care for them . Failure to satisfy Mom has left them feeling shaky , unlovable , insecure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to garner the personal power to initiate projects without someone else 's direction . Now enter the White Knight to take charge . Ruth Hawkins was one respondent whose story closely follows this scenario . Recently divorced after a fifteen-year marriage , Ruth had hoped her ex-husband Ken would be her liberation from demon Mom . Marriage spelled the chance " to get out of that restrictive , hostile , arid , barren place that I grew up in . " As the oldest of five children , Ruth must have caught the full force of her mother 's harsh expectations : " My mother is a very strong-willed , dominating , domineering person who needs to exercise a tremendous amount of control over the people who live in her house . When I was growing up , I felt 99 percent of the time that I was a problem , that I was n't good enough in terms of behavior . " ' I'o make matters worse , Mom 's bite was just as bad as her bark . Here Ruth invidiously compares her mother 's style of discipline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . I never felt threatened when my father was hitting us , because I knew my father was a very controlled person ; he knew when to stop . Whereas my mother , you did n't know . She might beat you right into the ground . . . . My mother is not a sensitive person . I think she 'd like to he , but it 's not there inside of her . My father has it inside of him . My father had a gift for making you feel loved , even when he was giving you a licking , whereas when my mother gave you a licking , you knew it was done with a vengeance and she meant to do it because she wanted to release all of that hostility and resentment that you were the cause of . Here as elsewhere , Ruth 's account signals a sense of defensive alliance with her father , whom she sees as the saving grace of her childhood . Yet , it is clear that she saw her father neither as a model to emulate in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband should be . If anything , her father was a negative example of the husband she would need , because , as Ruth puts it , " He gets overpowered . I do n't think he 's particularly good at defending his position . I probably was looking for someone not like my father so that I would n't be like my mother . " Ruth 's thoughts about marriage were thus a dialogue with her mother 's version of female adequacy . Mortified  | by that unlovable and faulty female she was in her mother 's eyes , yet also horrified by the prospect of being that unloving and fault-finding kind of female that her mother represented , Ruth had no apprehension of her female personhood that could differentiate her from her mother . In the end , it was her mother 's critical judgment that Ruth bought the mist . I icr premarital ' inutships were marred by the conviction that her basic female self was deft%tite . Speaking of one suitor , she recalls : w , ts very , very drawn to him Ainl he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to open up , to talk to him , to tell him who I really was . And the timer we became , the more time we spent together , the more closed up I be.Ante . I was in afraid of this pet um getting to knc , sv nu ? . ind seeing how little I had to oiler , Tht rs how I felt at the time . 1Ic ould n't possibly want to know me , to be with me After several such tuurtsiup experu ? nces , Ruth met Ken , and their relationship developed on the basis of Ken 's appearing to understand the difficulties Ruth had been having with her self-esteem . We would talk about my feelings of inferiority , and he seemed to be sensitive to things that I was going through . He used an inherently good and caring kind of trait in a very destructive way , but I did n't know that then . The more he knew about what was going on in my mind , the easier it was for him to manipulate me . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I did n't have to make , really , any decisions . At the time I looked upon that as a caring kind of thing . Not only did this white knight Ken seem to be nurturing but he also appeared ( in the fashion of all white knights ) to be powerful . " I think that 's one of the things that attracted me to him ? he had power , and I did n't . " With his power , he could define her , direct her , make her whole , tell her what she needed , since she herself felt too powerless to know her own needs , and too weak , in any case , to take the strides required to get them met . It was not long before Ruth became a prisoner of her own powerlessness , for Ken was neither nurturing nor inclined to lead Ruth in ways that would bring her to greater wholeness . Far from liberating her from her critical mother , this white knight turned out to be the demon mother in disguise . His expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found nothing but fault in whatever Ruth did , probably because he depended on her inferiority to nail down his own elusive sense of male importance : It was horrible from the very beginning . He did such . t good job at always putting me down and belittling me and reminding nu that I w .. % inept and incompetent and stupid that I never focussed on what my urcngths really were .  | I was constantly trying to become better and better and better . He could come home and reel off the things I had n't done right , and rant and scream , and the next day I 'd do it the way he told me to , and then that was wrong ! I could have put the salt on the wrong side of the dish ? and I 'm being literal . I mean , it started there and worked it 's way up , and infiltrated everywhere in the relationship . I just was not living up to his expectations , and I thought there was something radically wrong with me . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was growing up ; I never pleased anybody when I was growing up . And now I was in this situation again . I just beat myself silly for many , many years . The circle is thus complete . Ruth fell back into the paradigm she knew too well : When your partner expects the moon , you shoot for it , since t glimmer of a chance for success is the one chink of light in an otherwise bla abyss of inadequacy . There really was no choice . Only an autonomous pf son could carve out her own direction ; one who remains undifferentiat from a stronger partner 's directives does not know how to be a self witho that guidance . The alternative is the nightmare of being alone with oneself . self who knows itself only as incompleteness , and who therefore lacks t. wholeness of vision that would have rendered a white knight unnecessary the first place . In summary , second-corner paradigms focus on the things that are su posed to happen ( or , just as importantly , not happen ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored the themes of attachment/abando ment , affection/coldness , conflict/harmony , and power/deference . Othe might have been considered as well . It has not always been easy or possible clearly distinguish these second-corner themes from inner-corner theme Perhaps the difficulty arises because the self is just one self , so when we to of its three " corners " , we are not dealing with separate " things " but with thr different angles of vision the self can adopt as it makes its way in the wort Now we shall consider the third-corner . Third-Corner Issues Before proceeding , perhaps a conceptual reminder will prove useful : A " thin corner " refers to any recurring interest that " triangulates " one partner 's atte tion away from the other partner . jobs and children . are surely the most fr quently held third-corners . Most partner have , in addition , various leisu interests , one or more friends , parents and/or relatives , religious or spiritu interests , and so forth . Any third-corner of one partner may clash with tl other partner 's second-corner ( partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such conflict from early in his twenty-year marriage 1 Maureen : " I established a habit that hugged Maureen : reading the paper  | he breakfast table . She complained about this , so I gave her part of the raper . " As seen here , any third-corner can he done jointly or independently rf one 's partner . I co retained his third-corner morning interest by simply onverting it from independent to joint activity : both partners were now riding the per instead of oust one . ( ) 1 course , joint third-corners still shift he partners ' energy . rw.is from each other , but they may also provide the ? minion lot us for expanded partnership interaction . Leo and Maureen might , or example , begin to t hat shout some newspaper story . In the same way , children t irate the potential for point tri.urgul.ttion , although they often seem to +moire the wife 's independent third corners rather than truly joint ones . A partner 's independent third corners always heighten the potential for onfhtts hetause of the tham r that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , or abandoned . Such feelings may indeed have basis in ! r.rlrt ' , since there is alw.ivs the possibility that a partner will rrtonre so enamoured of sonic independent third-corner that she or he will use all interest in the partnership-corner , perhaps even permanently . A lover of course the classic example here . As mentioned earlier , triangulation is the mover and shaker of marital lynamics . I low partners handle their third-corners always creates repercusions for their partnership-corners . But the reverse is also true . Many of the econd-corner arrangements described in the previous section bear greatly on he way that partners structure their third-corners . Of these arrangements , rower relationships probably generate the most far-reaching third-corner onseyuences . Power in a partnership is not just power over the twosome vhen the spouses are together , or over the inner workings of their household . t is also the power to determine one 's own movements in third-corners away rom the partner , and to give or withhold permission to the partner for such movements . In other words , the taking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a badge of power . With power , one can say uccessfully , " I 'll do what I want . You ca n't tell me what to do . " With power , ikewise , one can say , " You may do only what I want you to do . " If second-corner power creates more space for third-corner indepenlence , that independence creates the basis for further expansion of the power hat gave rise to it . Willard Waller pointed out this relationship years ago vith his " principle of less interest " : the partner who is less involved and in'ested in the partnership always has more power . ' What Waller might have dded is that less interest in the partnership typically rests on some greater dative interest in one or more independent third-corners and in the resources hey put at one 's disposal . Herein lies the staggering advantage of economic ndependence over economic dependence on a partner . Such independence is isually secured on the basis of an income-earning lob , which may itself offer abundant third-corner stimulation , esteem , and belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the control of the partner . clone . But even  | short of these less tangible resources , jobs offer money , and in a consume society money is power . Ultimately , money is the power to say , " I can pay it own way if I must , so if you value my partnership , you must pay heed to IT wants and my needs and not just to your own . " 7 The strings of patriarchy have always been pulled through the purs , Women find it easier to resist male arbitrariness when they are economical . independent of any would-be puppeteers . I asked fifty-six-year-old Theln . Jensen if she " backs down " more than her husband Ben does . " In the begii ning , I did , " she replied , " but not any more . I think going to work did that ft me . " Thelma went on to recount some often humorous episodes in which stand Ben have been at odds with each other . Notice how she herself appeal fully aware that her third-corner independence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to think of Ben as a fuddy-duddy . He was so much more conservative than I about a lot of things . Our friends kid him about it . But it 's him . For instance , he 's so cheap . Like , we play poker about every Saturday night with the same people ? we 've done it for years . At the end we play showdown , and Ben will never bet a side bet . We used to go out with people and have a drink , and he 'd never have a second drink . If I have a second drink , I pay for it myself . He looks for all the cheapest brands . We always shop together , always have . ( We do everything together , really . ) He likes smelly cheese and I do n't , and I like strawberries and he does n't . So he 'll pick up a cheese , and if I pick up some strawberries he 'll say , " What are you buying those for ? " Before I worked , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every so often I have to remind him that I earn as much as he does . It bugs him , and I do n't do it often . emphasis added He 'll only go fifty-five miles an hour . When I 'm driving I go faster , and as long as he 's sleeping he does n't notice it . He likes to sleep in the back of the truck . I told him when we got it that I refuse to sleep in the back of the truck . So we stop at a motel . Before , he used to get the cheapest motels . I could n't say anything , because we did n't have much money . Now I say , " You ca n't take it with you . And I wo n't sleep in the back of the truck . " The kids gave , us tickets to a concert and $20 for dinner once , and my son said , " Now Mother , do n't let him take you to Bonanza ! " This sort of thing . And yet he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him . It 's the way he was brought up . His mother would roll her own noodles to save money . When people marry , they do not work out their third-corner manage ment strategies from scratch . Once again , they are informed by paradigms ? the familiar images that linger on as traces of what they experienced prior t marriage , particularly at home . Essentially , there is only one third-corne drama , notwithstanding its enormous variety of scenes and stagings : acces sihility versus independence . The most aggravated struggles of partncrshil  | around this issue , with children having ample opportunity to see the ed tensions heat up and to form notions about what , if anything , they do about it in their own married lives . usbands and wives are either equally accessible or equally inaccessible other , the resulting symmetry and balance will keep their relationship ven keel . Such is rarely the case , however , and Waller 's principle of ! rest reminds us that one partner is usually less accessible than the Jnder conditions of partriarchy , wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for child-care anchors them to to and leaves them economically dependent , while husbands ' occupahird-corners keep them inaccessible to the home and give them the is leverage to maintain domestic power . This arrangement is ultimore satisfying to men than to women . Males leap into third-corner dence and limited accessibility to females ; boys who were reared by a crave activity away from female control in order to confirm their nity . Females often leap into total accessibility to males , having been ) rincipally for partnership , but if they can not tame their husbands ' in'ility , their yearning to be nurtured and not just be nurturing may reustrated . Numerous studies show that wives score lower than husn almost every measure of mental health and life-satisfaction. ' ny of my respondents retain vivid images of the conflicts between ) thers ' wishes for more nurturance and their fathers ' craving for thirdindependence . Daughters typically remain identified with their in this conflict , unless their connection with the latter has been ed by excessive frictions . This identification is not simply some loyalty to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as their own experience with their fathers . Like others , daughters may feel deprived of attention and consideration e man of the house and be alert to the dangers of a man 's third-corner dence . Nellie Green is one respondent whose familiar paradigm pror with abundant material in this regard : father was married to his job and spent a lot of time away . I did n't want in my own marriage . I do n't think my mother got much emotional supMy father was n't cold , but his warmth was given in ways other than t I like to get . He was not affectionate or emotional with us .... When ion occurred it was always about his spending more time at his job than ) me . It did n't happen often , because my mother was used to it . He 's been 1 for seven years now , and when she talks about their marriage it 's all Itopian terms . She said to me recently , when my sister met a man and vied him in two weeks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at the wonderful life we had . " I felt tempted to coy , " Cut the shit , her ! " ... There was a lot of love between them . The conflict came n she could n't put up with not getting her nerds met Anymore . It would  | happen at 10 P.M. when Mother was in the kitchen banging pots and pans and he was drinking coffee . They 'd argue about it . Nellie is rather pointed here in debunking what to her are some fanciful mystifications on her mother 's part . In the same vein she says , " I 've always had the seed for being independent and self-sufficient , and not being like my mother , depending on a man to make me happy . That 's one thing I was determined to avoid . " But Nellie 's analysis is perched on the hindsight of her own ten-year marriage , and it took her at least half of those ten years to begin to break out of her mother 's pattern of dependency . It is true that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sense of independence , as she worked on a master 's degree . Still , this is a woman who had thought marriage " was going to be absolute Utopia , the answer to all my hopes and dreams , " who yearned to be " well cared for and adored , " whose mother was " a Wonder Woman homemaker " devoted only to her husband and six children and who " cried for days " after Nellie , her oldest daughter , left home . When Nellie got pregnant just as she was finishing her degree , all the fun seemed to be instantly gone . " Reality set in . I went through a conflict of wanting to be taken care of by men . That was part of what hit : not only was I not going to be taken care of ( Ron is very independent of me , both in getting and giving ) , I was going to have someone else to take care of . I was n't ready for that . " Once the baby came , Nellie stayed home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frustrated : I was insecure and uncertain . I felt I had no meaning or purpose in my life . I expected Ron to make me happy , and it was n't happening . I bitched a lot . The worse I got , the less he gave , and the more I wanted . I wanted him to tell me I was beautiful , bring me a present ? I had this whole list of things . I 'd decide what he had to do when he walked in the door in the evening , and if he did n't do it , I 'd be angry . Of course , I did n't clue him in ! I did n't tell him what to do , but I told him afterwards what he had n't done . And no matter what he did , he could n't meet my expectations . Plainly , Nellie 's " seed for being independent " was simply washed away by those countertendencies that were more in keeping with her familiar paradigm . Rather than rejecting her mother 's model of dependency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mother was right in what she wanted but she was n't demanding enough . I 'm going to insist that my husband adore me properly . " It is unusual in my data for men to renounce their third-corner independence . The men who reported some confrontations initiated by mothers about what their fathers were doing outside the home rarely had sympathy for their mother 's point of view . Instead , they tended to criticize their mothers for being too demanding or domineering , and they did their best to find  | more compliant wives . In American culture , men have always assumed that outside third-corners are their right , especially activities that can be broadly construed as work-related , but even some independent recreational interests are held to be perfectly defensible. 1 lere is a man who sides squarely with his father : My mother was an extremely jealous woman , and that made for some fights , hut with seven children , my father had to work a lot in the paper mill . His lob in the mill was always a day job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and get done . tbnut main , and then he would either cut wood or he did gardens , or he had . t ( aterpillar tractor and he dug foundations and did grading . Ile was ambitious . So there u'a no hash , for your rnothe'rs te'alousy ? No , she was jealous of other women , hut he was always busy on jobs and she just fantasized . That 's the way I look at it . Notice how , in siding with his father , this man chooses to believe that his father " was always busy on jobs , " without , presumably , having any more evidence than he thinks his mother had . Another respondent saw his mother as being out of line for keeping his father too confined to the home : I think my mother was more the ruler than my father . Sometimes I did n't particularly care for that . Like if I wanted to take him to a ball game , she would put up a stink , and of course my father would say , " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that this wo n't happen with me . If I 'm going to make a decision , I want her to go along with it . To he sure , men do not always ally themselves with their fathers . Many of my male respondents had considerable issues with their fathers , and some felt the same lack of an adult stale presence in the home that was mentioned by female respondents . I lal Stern was one of the more articulate men in discussing his father 's inaccessibility : I renumber reading my father 's obituary , and it was an interesting obituary . I lc had been a member of this faculty and that faculty , and done this and that , and nowhere in there did it mention his family . Well , it did ; I think it said that he was " survived by " ? and that 's just about it . We were able to survive his career ! And that really struck me , that the model I would like to create for our family is that my obituary would read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his daughter , with his family , " and that there would be very little mention of any natu ) tial associations or anything like that . pal 's remarks are indeed pointed , but the fact remains that American culture holds out tremendous rewards to men who will stnglrtntmdc ? dly devote  | themselves to their career or at least to earning a living . Just as a wom : renounces her mother 's dependency finds it difficult to avoid falling int a man who renounces his father 's inaccessibility often winds up repeati pattern . Hal himself did not realize the extent to which he modeled after his father : " I think I was looking for a woman , at that time , who support my interests and give me support during the time that I was my education and pursuing my career . " Later in the interview he talkec " the pressure and stress " that he carries into his family from his job : I find that a lot of times my mind might be working on problems left o from the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knob does . This weekend I took Friday off and we went down to the cottage the weekend . When we got there I realized I was having trouble leaving problems of my job behind . I managed to do it but it was hard . When I up in the morning my mind is on what I 'm going to do at work . Bud Parker was another respondent who often felt neglected by hii throughout his childhood : My father was so busy that he did n't have a lot of time for the family and me . I was an only child , and I would have liked to do things with him , but did n't get home until eight or nine at night . It also bothered me that he wa spending more time with my mother . She 's a very intelligent woman , an can now see that she learned over the years to accept his dedication to work . He 's a very responsible man , and when he 's committed to someth he does it , even if his time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that . Despite nis best intentions , when Bud began his career of college teach found it all too easy to throw himself totally into his work : " - 'k , ' first year was extremely difficult . I had never taught before , and I 1-to spend six hours preparing for each hour of class . We fought more tl year than we ever have , because of the stress I was under . I remember Nor being angry at me for the amount of time I had to spend , but I had to spenu to meet my responsibility . Sounds like your father ! It does . I could n't imagine not teaching well . I 'd always wanted to b ( ( teacher . Yes , it does sound like my father . I 'd say the biggest strain we have my overcommitment to my job ; and yet I like it . Norma 's account indicates that the pattern has not changed a great de . the years .  | He makes an effort to say no more to committees and such . Each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does n't turn out that way ; something at school always fills the time . We 're learning to accept that he just wo n't have the kind of time we 'd like . Ile does make the effort to be around more . And I 'm more accepting of how things are . But it can still be a sore point . Notice the parallel between Norma 's response ? " I 'm more accepting of how things are "  --  and Bud 's own account of his mother 's response to his father ? " I can now see that she learned over the years to accept his dedication to his work . " Thus far we have looked only at those third-corner issues in which " female " needs for nurturance come into conflict with " male " needs for thirdcorner independence . Of course , wives too may have independent thirdcorners , and husbands sometimes struggle with their partner 's inaccessibility . In a culture of patriarchy , however , female third-corners are rarely carried to the extremes of independence that male ones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership more than independent activity . Often , wives ' independent third-corners are other partners , such as a mother , a sister , or female friends . These alternate partners may sometimes occasion some grievances from husbands , but since under patriarchy wives still give top priority to making themselves accessible to their husbands whenever the latter might want them , issues between spouses in this area are usually avoided . As the literature often notes , the tie between married women and their mothers frequently remains a close one . A girl 's mother is her first love , and unlike sons , daughters have no gender-inspired motive to emotionally separate from that bond . Married daughters whose mothers remain close at hand ideally have a reliable and proven source of support , a third-corner partnership that antedates and is independent of their husbands . This bond may be even stronger than usual when it is fed by circumstances that throw a mother toward her daughter as her only significant support . Such circumstances are well illustrated by Ruby Nelson , an only child whose mother had her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of her life , Ruby and her mother lived alone with Ruby 's grandmother . Then her mother married an abusive man , whom she divorced when Ruby was a senior in high school . It was a turbulent , difficult marriage . Ruby 's stepfather was " a drinker and a gambler " who would pick fights with her mother , while Ruby would " stand in the corner and scream . " Ruby recalls than her mother dealt with her own unhappiness by turning to her . My mother and I were very close . She was like a sister to me . She was quite possessive , and that did cause tension in our marriage . When Ruby 's mother remarried a year after her divorce , she moved to Florida for a short time . Ruby then married Greg , in part because she had no home , and she ( lid not want to he alone .  | I did love Greg at that time , but another reason was that my mother had jt remarried . I could have gone to Florida for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to do that . I did n't have any money , I was young , my moth was leaving , and I did n't know what I was going to do . . . . I kind of resent my new stepfather . I wanted my mother to be happy and secure , but I miss having her close and being able to talk with her . The fact is that Ruby and her mother had developed a long-standir pendent alliance with each other . Ruby emerged with two working elc or rules in her marital paradigm . The first rule was drawn from her of perience and told her , depend on your mother for getting your emotion . port . The second rule was drawn from what her mother modeled , an her , when your husband becomes hostile , unavailable , or inaccessib pend on your daughter for getting your support . Ruby 's marriage confi to her paradigm . Greg did become fairly inaccessible , pursuing a job on the roa typically kept him away from home except on weekends , and when hr through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , he became extremely hostile to her , just as Ruby 's step had been toward her mother . Ruby 's predictable response was to dr , both of the familiar elements in her paradigm . On one hand , she contin get the emotional support she had always gotten from her mother , wh long since returned from Florida ; on the other , she also began to lean relationship with her own oldest daughter , just as her mother had don her . And there are recent signs that this mother ? daughter alliance pat being carried into a third generation . Ruby 's second oldest daughter , who had been extremely rebellious and rejecting of her parents throu her teens , has recently married and provided Ruby and Greg with the grandchild , as fate would have it , another girl : I told you how Sheila had rejected us and the home when she was young ( Now she keeps saying how much she loves us , and every time she has a pro lem she calls home . Before she did n't want us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or call us enough . In a patriarchal setting , women like Ruby whose strongest third-c are their mothers or children do not usually threaten men , because as they continue to reserve their highest priority for their husbands . Econon and emotionally dependent on their marriages , they lack the autono make vigorous claims on behalf of any needs that are independent of husbands or children . In contrast , some women come to marriage a equipped with a spirit of third-corner initiative and a determinati develop some talent or capacity that may have little to do with any pa ship per se . As we shall see , these women may easily offend their husl sensibilities , particularly if the husbands are governed by familiar pans  | that instruct them that a wife is not supposed to have individual needs other than marital and family service . The circumstances that may lead a girl into third-corner autonomy are several . Perhaps the most important contributing paradigm element is a mother who consistently modeled female involvement in some strong , independent third-corner of her own . For example , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , her mother never remarried . Gail 's paternal grandmother , who lived with them , was the one who did the daytime childcare and housework , while Gail 's mother held a full-time job . Seeing is believing , and Gail grew up watching her hreadwinning mother maintain a regular third-corner outside the home . With this familiar paradigm , Gail simply assumed that it is perfectly appropriate for females to have an active outside life . Even in her childhood she found it natural to cultivate third-corners away from the home that were not simply extensions of some partnership . I did n't give much thought to marriage . When I was growing up I was very active and interested in things at school , belonged to clubs , was in athletics , and went camping , so when I thought of the future , I thought about what I wanted to do . I wanted to be a nurse and then a vet . In sixth or seventh grade I got very interested in sports and got into leadership positions in athletics . For quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gail 's husband Brian was anything but prepared for a wife with such an independent stance toward her own third-corner activity . His familiar paradigm was far more in keeping with the traditional patriarchal arrangement . He says : The role of the wife that I observed in my mother was what I assumed a wife would be : picking up , having meals prepared on time , spending a lot of time taking care of the home , etcetera . Those notions have been the cause of problems between me and Gail throughout our relationship . What I wanted in a wife did n't jibe with her assertive personality . My mother had been submissive with my father . Gail was not that way with me , and it was confusing to our interaction . The basic conflict between Brian 's and Gail 's familiar paradigms led to some predictably stormy episodes , first during courtship and then continuing into the marriage . Brian recalls : We were two very strong-willed individuals , fighting it out . We had a lot of screaming arguments about small things , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going somewhere . She 'd want to stop , and I like to get where I 'm going . A lot of clashes of will . It was like we were both saying , " Why do n't you do it the way I want to ? "  | Gail remembers similar episodes : We had minor hassles , and one really bad fight that first year of marriagi was about something I was determined I was going to do , and he was de mined I was n't , and he physically blocked the door so I could n't get oc decked him , and he decked me back . . . . My concerns about being mar had to do with how free I 'd be , whether I 'd have someone who 'd tell me s I could and could n't do . That was probably the real issue behind the fight . The most difficult thing for me was having to check in with someone a where I was and how long I 'd be . Brian would always call to let me kr where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Recall that unlike Brian 's , Gail 's life-experience had never exposed he nificant female figures subordinating themselves to a man or even net coordinate their own movements with those of a man . It then becom how truly paradigmatic her conflicts were with Brian . Both were drawing on the images that were most deeply imprinted from their ea perience , and seeking to translate the seemingly workable images in own married lifestyle . Notice , once more , the intimate connection between third-corn ( pendence and power in a partnership-corner . If patriarchy means 1 ( male power , and if power in a marriage rests on the chance to secure tant life resources in independent third-corners , then women with th ( third-corner resources have , like Gail , the basis not only for making c balancing power claims in their marriage but also for more actively t their own needs . A wife with such resources may not necessarily love I band less , but she may need him less . Her inner-corner has expand grown more complex , so that marital and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within her . She may require some outsi ners to externalize her inner urges , capacities , skills , talents , and imi If a mother 's modeling is the most typical influence on a girl 's third habits , the second most prominent influence comes from her father . father responds to a daughter only as a cute little thing , the girl gets tl sage that rewards will flow to her through pleasing a man with her sec ness . But some fathers stand ready to see their daughters as active agent world , as independent centers of power and initiative , not simply as tories of charm , sweetness , and service . If such fathers are also ready t ( late this vision into ongoing activities with their daughters , activities tr to the cultivation of particular skills or talents or capacities , then the da may form strong habits of third-corner independence by the time they even if their mothers never themselves modeled such third-corner inter Kelly Sampson nicely illustrates this pattern : My father was the dominant figure , and my mother was the subservient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to marry a dominating fig (  | because I had ideas of my own and I did n't want to have to fight to get them out . I knew I had more on my mind than just wanting to sit home and be a housewife . My mother could never really express her own endeavors or be her own person . Though Kelly does not sound very sympathetic to either her mother or her father , she told me she felt more closely identified with her father . " I think my relationship with my father was always closer . I was never close to my mother and never would discuss my problems with her . " The father ? daughter closeness did not appear to stem from any greater case in discussing her problems with her father . Rather , it arose from what they did together . Kelly 's father was a high school physical education instructor , and his devotion to sports apparently spilled over into his family activity : We were very involved as a family unit when I was growing up , especially through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent . My two brothers and I were always involved in sports . I never thought about marriage at all . I was always too involved in what I was doing ? sports , and majorette in band in high school , taking lessons myself . I had a steady boyfriend in high school , but that became a convenient type of thing , having a social partner . He was also involved in sports . That 's always been an equalling factor for me . In college I was involved in gymnastics . I met my husband on a trampoline our third day of college . By the time Kelly married near the end of her college career , her thirdcorner habits of independence had long been established . Later , we shall see in another context that once her first child came , she could not seem to avoid falling into her mother 's " subservient " pattern of housewifely dependency for a time . The important point here is that her familiar paradigm always included these other counter-tendencies of independence , aided by her father 's encouragement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose , as she eventually did . Aside from a mother modeling third-corner independence , or a father helping his daughther to develop it , a girl can form strong third-corners through other pathways as well . Older brothers sometimes help sisters develop athletic or other physical skills . Some girls who have difficult relationships with their parents escape into independence through some consuming pursuit such as tending and riding horses . " As a teenager , " Janet Murray told me , " the biggest thing in my life was being able to have a horse and mastering horsemanship and finding rewards there , and that took me through an awful lot of rocky roads that other kids were having difficulties with . " For Wet , as we shall see , horsemanship was not simply a childhood pursuit but has remained a lifelong passion .  | Other female respondents found an independent niche through tl complishments in the school system . " My mother 's values were alien t Alice Berger told me . " I 'm more like my father . It irritated her that I t the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by working in the and reading . " Alice 's penchant for reading carried her through some d years in secondary school : I was Franco-American , and when I went to Lewiston , from a French pa chial school , they automatically put me in the lowest division . I was ten ye old , in the sixth grade , and I was with kids who were about sixteen , wait to get out of school . Fortunately I had a good teacher who understood . pushed the work to me , and I thrived on it . When I was in junior high tl did n't want me to take the college course because they thought I 'd just married and have kids , but a teacher intervened and let me take it . I gra ( ( ated eleventh in my class . I was n't accepted by the crowd I 'd have liked to in , so I read and sewed .

Then , with a move to another state , no j neighbors , two small children , and a husband who was gone from dt dusk , Alice still flourished in a situation in which many women woul languished . Her third-corner independence and resourcefulness were than enough to sustain her : wilds and landscaped and I grew a garden . We worked on the house as had the money . I sewed and refinished furniture . I never remember a tit when I got bored . Twenty-two years of marriage to Tim have not changed Alice 's thirdautonomy . She appreciates whatever attention he gives her , but she dc seem to crave very much because she is essentially self-stimulating : I think of myself as myself , not as Tim 's wife or the kids ' mother , and T sees me as myself too .

Ivan Nye , and Ira Reiss ( New York : Free Press , 1979 ) , pp. he link between work , income , and marital power has been explored more Philip Blumstein and Pepper Schwartz , American Couples ( New York : ) rrow , 1983 ) , especially pp. 51-111 , and 139-145. c of the more notable studies is Walter Gove and Jeanette Tudor , " Adult nd Mental Illness , " American Journal of So ( ) ology 78 ( 1973 ) : 8 I2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus has centered on two aspects of the images that people bring to their marriages : first , the paradigms themselves ( the actual pictures that people have of how their three corners might be arranged ) , and second , their feelings about these arrangements ? the standpoints that people adopt toward the scenarios they know , as seen in their tendencies to embrace , reject , or fall into them . I now introduce a third aspect through which people organize and flesh out their images of marriage . A marriage agenda is a mental outline of the type of work or " business " that people seek to transact in their marriages . It is a set of intentions through which they translate their stance toward their familiar paradigm into an actual program . Marriage agendas thus reflect what people want to do in light of their knowledge and feelings about what might happen to them in a marriage . Like the marital paradigms that underlie them , marriage agendas may be simple or elaborate , strongly or weakly held , implicit or remarkably explicit , as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fully cognizant of what their marriage agendas are , while others are unconscious of them , believing that they would never have constructed such a thing . These latter people may , in fact , be fairly free of agendas for marriage . Often , however , agendas are carried unconsciously , and they are hidden from awareness only because their implementation is smooth , easy , and unchallenged . Before looking at some actual marriage agendas , we might consider why such agendas commonly arise . Immediately , we are struck by a paradox . On one hand , most people who contemplate marriage see it as a fresh start , a chance to do something new and different . On the other hand , everything said here so far should indicate that in marriage we continue to interact with the old and familiar . Both sides of the paradox are in fact true . Marriage is indeed a new chance to deal with old issues , and though many people fancy marriage to be a great escape from these issues , they often revert back into old strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( pie often have some pressing needs before they marry , and getting married does not make these needs magically go away .  | The late psychologist Abraham Maslow often wrote about deficiency needs and growth needs , and his claims are useful in coming to terms with the marriage agendas I found in my data . Deficiency needs are basic needs like safety and security , love and affection , and self-esteem . If these needs have never been properly gratified , the person is left in a relatively deprived frame of mind . In contrast , growth needs focus on realizing one 's potential through the free exercise of one 's creative capacities , and these come to predominate only after the basic deficiency needs have been at least minimally gratified . ' People who , as children , never felt safe or adequately nurtured or respected seem to act so as to secure these needs for themselves as adults , and creative self-expression may get temporarily if not permanently postponed . They may then bring this deficiency motivation into their marriages , beginning with their actual search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sharply focussed their marriage agendas will be , restricting their vision only to those potential partners who seem willing to attend to their deficits . With good reason Marvin Goodman found that people who score low on measures of self-acceptance tend to select partners who narrowly complement their own needs , while high self-accepters seem to be open to a much wider and more random range of possible partners.2 One woman in my sample mused : My personality has always been " will of the wind . " When I 'm with various types of people I can do what they 're doing and enjoy it . I could have married several kinds of men and fit into their life-style . Eric is n't that adaptable . He would n't have been able to get along with as many kinds of women . These are clearly the words of a basic need-gratified person whose agendas for marriage are open and flexible . Her vision of partnership did not have to he narrowed down for the sake of filling a particular deficit . The difference between open and closed agendas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look at the full range of agenda types I found in my data . Avoiding the Demon The marriage agenda that can perhaps become most rigid and inflexible is Avoiding the Demon . Typically , this agenda is held by people who soundly reject some elements of their familiar paradigm . They have powerful images of one or more disaster scenarios which they saw played out at home . ' I here were traumatic childhood or adolescent scenes either for themselves or for one or both of their parents . In some instances , these scenes left them with some unmet basic needs , and marriage is then seen as a chance to Iill the dcheit to he finally safe instead of unprotected , or loved instead of unloved , or . ut.teheel  | instead of abandoned , or respected instead of scorned . Typical demons avoided are alcohol , confrontation and conflict , divorce , undesirable 1 relationships , unseemly dispositions in a partner , extramarital intim and abandonment . Several of these themes are often found together , as case of Morris Gorman , a thirty-eight-year-old businessman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite young , and we kids were put ini state homes . Then my mother , my real mother , had some illegitima children , so I have half-sisters and half-brothers . My mother used to con see me once in a while . She had a lot of problems . Even at five or six yea old I knew things was n't right . My mother had a lot of men calling and th , did n't set with me . Here we see themes of divorce , abandonment , and extramarital intima ( coming together to form Morris 's disaster scenario . His strategy for d ( with this scenario became obvious when I asked him if he knew what ties he wanted in a partner . He replied , " I wanted a pure girl : I did n't someone that flaunted herself around . I did n't want to be married to maid . And I certainly did n't want to be divorced . " For Morris , whose hood was fraught with so much uncertainty and instability of pat figures , marriage is largely seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned , and to be attached to someone whose moral y would make it unthinkable for her to repeat what he sees as his mother ' tern of betrayal . People with strong agendas to avoid some demon are often recogni through their courtship processes . For them , there are certain behavior. they will simply not tolerate in a partner , and any potential mate why plays these behaviors during courtship will be eliminated from consider On some matters they may expect to compromise , but there are botton requirements that are nonnegotiable . " Almost everything that I did n't w ; my marriage had to do with alcohol , " said a woman whose childhooc split between her aunt and uncle 's home and her father and stepmothe My uncle was a drunk . He abused my aunt at times , but they ignored eac other more than anything else . My uncle went on binges . My father dran from Friday night at five until he was n't aware of anything Saturday night Then he slept until it was time to go to work Monday morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in liquor at all . It was the source of a the disruption of my childhood . Another woman said , " I knew I definitely did n't want to marry a play Her father had died when she was an infant , and she had heard " a few nel things " from her mother concerning his intideltts . " And I made some infer  | ny own mind that ? well , I do n't think I would really like that kind of style . " Clark Mason 's demon to be avoided centered on conflict and confrontat . The sixth of seven children , Clark was only six years old when his mother ) rced his alcoholic father after twenty-five tumultuous years . As he sees it v , Clark got caught in the fallout of his mother 's anger and frustration : My younger brother and I never could figure out why my mother always appeared mad at us . Much later I realized that her living that long with alcohol had to make her angry , and I think that just carried right over . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , and I think we took a lot of that for a lot of years , and really did n't understand it . . . . The way that I dealt with her anger was by running away from it as much as I could . I 'd be out of the house a lot . I worked all the time . When I was going to high school I 'd start work at four in the morning , I 'd go to school , and I 'd work at night . That 's all I did until I went into the service . the time Clark married , he had formed a marriage agenda that was a ' ct response to his experience with anger and conflict : In my mother 's second marriage she was still angry , and there was always a lot of hollering and fighting back and forth . I was determined that that would not be the case in any marriage that I went into . Whoever this would be would be someone that 's pretty mild-mannered and would n't be taking to fireworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , and low , with the added benefit that Henrietta helped convince Clark that his ential for success in life was far greater than his low self-esteem would allow to consider . Their marriage lasted for eleven years before Clark filed for ) rce . For the first ten years , Clark studiously avoided coming to grips with enormous differences between them . Henrietta hated Maine and wanted to in the South ; Clark had no interest in leaving . She did not want any dren ; he came to want them , though he had earlier agreed not to have any . wanted to live in the country ; she wanted to live in town . He wanted to own ) use ; she wanted to rent . He wanted an active social life ; her style was more usive . He wanted some outside athletic activities in his leisure time ; she was -e of a homebody and had no interest in athletic pursuits . She wanted to el during vacation times ; he often would have preferred to stay home . With exception of continuing to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erences . Clark now faults himself for not being aggressive enough : If there was a problem , I think that it was with me , because she communicated what she wanted . She made it clear what she wanted , and I did n't communicate with her the way I should have on the things that I wanted . I let myself get  | pushed around . I 'm sure I felt some resentment , but I do n't think it was strong , because I accepted getting pushed around . Clark can not recall a single argument in their eleven years of marriage . Henrietta may have been more vocal in expressing her tangible wants , but she likewise steered clear of any confrontation , and both partners made hardly any emotional demands on one another . Clark summarizes : Our whole marriage was smooth , except for the last year . When I said I wanted someone that did n't fight with me , that 's exactly what I got . That was a big problem . There should have been some fighting , and there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was absolutely no exchange . If there was something difficult to talk about , we just would n't , rather than risk getting into a fight . . . . I was very successful in my business and everything in my life was running smoothly ? I 'm sure that 's what I wanted to happen . There was no conflict , everything was going fine , and I accomplished the things I wanted to do . From what my mother and father went through and what all my brothers and sisters were going through four of the six of them have been divorced at least once , why , this felt , well , this must be right . I shall not detail the process through which Clark became dissatisfied with his conflict-free and emotionally vacuous marriage , nor his efforts to extricate himself from it . My purpose here is to show that demon conflict may become so dominating in a person 's familiar paradigm that successfully avoiding it can emerge as the only blueprint for constructing and maintaining a marriage . The fact that Henrietta and Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the one-sided partnership investments that plague other couples , and their marriage thus lumbered along for ten years . Nevertheless , third-corner symmetry alone is not a sticky enough glue to hold a couple together . When both partners adhere only to their own interests , with neither a vital partnership-corner nor any ongoing joint thirdcorners such as children or mutual leisure interests , the centrifugal force of separate concerns can stretch a marriage precariously thin . For Clark , the success of his marriage agenda ironically spelled the demise of his marriage . Avoiding the demon conflict worked so well that his vision of partnership was eventually freed up to focus on other needs and potentials for a marriage . Now in his second marriage , he cherishes the many ways that he and his new wife can connect together , and he has put aside his fear of conflict : " I always assumed that if you had confrontation , you were going to come out loser . I do n't find that to be the case now . If anything else , I think if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For some respondents , courtship screening out of unwanted demons was not successful , and that demon later managed to rear its ugly head . Some  | ) ondents who wanted no part of alcohol in their lives wound up struggling h a partner 's drinking problem or their own . The same was often true of cont . A male respondent who had hoped in his own marriage to avoid his aer 's withdrawal from discussion of marital issues picked a wife whose paswas to question and challenge everything . This man soon found himself ping that he was the target of criticism even where none was intended . He cted by withdrawing and becoming noncommunicative , much as his father 1 , and it took him many years before he could stop repeating that pattern . As have already seen , the path of least resistance is to fall back into the most tral elements of our familiar paradigms , and this is no less true of negative adigm elements than positive ones . A persons 's marriage agenda is binding ly on the level of intent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all ends on the paradigms and agendas that one 's partner brings to the marge , on how skillful one is in discovering what these are , and on the dynamics eashed by the convergence of these two unfolding life-patterns . Finally , while Avoiding the Demon may sometimes create some tunnel vin because it focusses mainly on negative scenarios , people who successly carry it out are not necessarily cast with partners whose only asset is that 1 , will not do the demonic deed , whatever it is . Sometimes , ruling out that ed through good courtship screening may be enough to fill some deficit left er from childhood , and the person may then be able to shift from deficiency ) tivation to growth motivation in the field of intimate relationships . Such a ift will be difficult if neither parent modeled a partnership role that could comfortably emulated . But if just one parent did so , or if other significant arital models were available with truly formative intensity , then the person ry he able in his or her own marriage to resoundingly transcend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five-year-old business maner speaks of his parents : They had an unhappy marriage . They were not compatible , but they stuck it out . My mother was a very cantankerous person ? I could n't live with her either . My father was very easygoing , and he and I did a lot together . My mother and I did n't have that type of relationship any more than she and my father did . I 'm sure my father was a very unhappy man because of not having a relationship with my mother , either physically or socially . rongly identified with his easygoing father , this man avoided the demon of cantankerous wife by choosing a mate who turned out to be unabashedly rifled to he married and dedicated to doing everything she could to make it : ) rk . Moreover , his wife had also been his childhood sweetheart , and from early age he was able to lavishly secure from her all the warmth and nurrance that he missed from his mother . Ile worked several summers for her ther , and he spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents '  | marriage a really positive , comfortable model , just the opposite of his ow parents ' . His wife remembers the first year they were married : Alan grew up where home did n't mean that much ; he did n't have the love I did growing up in the home . Listen ! That first year we were married , you just ca n't imagine ! He 'd come home at night and he 'd say , " I ca n't believe it . " He was just so overwhelmed by the happiness , to have a nice home . And it pleased me so much that I wanted to work even harder to make this happy for him , to make it a good marriage . To come home and have a hot meal at night , and a loving wife ? he 'd just never seen anything like this . And he still loves it after twenty-two years of marriage , I think . And I love having him come home . I 'm so thankful for our marriage . Safe Return Home Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to recapture it in their own . Their marriage agenda is diametrically opposite to Avoiding the Demon . Far from rejecting their familiar paradigm and steering clear of some disaster scenario of marriage , they embrace what their parents did and seek a partner with whom they can recreate it . Their image of marriage is not demonic but cozy and comfortable ; they want to make a Safe Return Home . For people with this agenda , marriage does not stand alone but must be linked up to the larger extended family circle . Marriage creates a new home and family , and thus a larger basis for solidifying one 's place in the entire kinship network . The pattern described by Elizabeth Bott applies here : People who have been residentially stable and who have always found ample social support in their kinship network will not tend to disrupt that network for the sake of a marriage . Rather , the marriage will be " superimposed " ( Bott 's term ) upon the pre-existing tightly-knit kin network. ; Thus it is not the parents ' marital relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special qualities ( if there are any ) of their emotional partnership , but the embeddedness of a family in the safe confines of the larger kin network : " My mother 's mother and father lived downstairs , " recalls Mike McCarthy , a thirty-sevenyear-old store manager , married twelve years . I asked him if they ate meals with his grandparents : Always . We did everything with my grandparents . Everytime one of them had to go somewhere , I 'd he tagging along with them when I was younger . ... On the weekends we used to go on picnics , go down to Belfast and have lobster feeds , and dig our own clams . A good twenty relatives would get together . A lot of my grandmother 's brothers and sisters would come . We 'd go out in a field and have cookouts . I had lots of uncles who did things with me too .  | Mike 's marriage to Jill had a rocky beginning , due in part to his reluctance to give up his previous life-style revolving around sports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a brief tug of war between the interests of his new domestic life and those of his male peer group . Safe Return Home then came to the rescue , with the birth of their first child : I think you can go right back to me wanting to start right then and there bringing my kids up the way I was , as far as being loving and affectionate . Ellen the baby was a big change for us . With the baby I had to stay home more . I think Ellen was the reason for us doing things together . And then when Suzy came along we did a lot more . . . . We moved back up over my grandparents where I was brought up , in the same apartment , and my wife thinks a lot of my grandmother , so I think that might have changed us a little bit for the better . Recall that in Mike 's familiar paradigm , children are often given over to their grandparents and other extended family members . New parenthood , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more firmly into the extended family circle , and one 's place in that home-centered world becomes still more solidly grounded . Safe Return Home is most often a working-class phenomenon , although we may find it held by anyone who has reason to downgrade the value of career success or who believes that existing kinship bonds are the only safe " haven in a heartless world , " to use Christopher Lasch 's lyrical phrase . Then too , any person who has been greatly sheltered as a child or adolescent or whose life has remained comfortably confined to a limited milieu may have little reason to envision forsaking that milieu for the great unknown . Among my respondents , Safe Return Home is commonly found in working-class rural or in small-town settings , although I would expect it to be common in the urban working class as well . Working-class worlds are sometimes " worlds of pain , " as in Lillian Rubin 's reckoning ? worlds replete with economic insecurity , alcohol abuse , and violence.4 But Rubin ignores just how often they are worlds with their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part by continuing ties with one 's family of origin . Gil Hopkins , a thirty-five-year-old truck mechanic , describes how he discovered his profound link with his parents : I was pretty strongheaded and my father was n't too much for tolerating too much bull . That 's the way he was brought up , so it passes on . I thought for a long time , where he was so tight , that he did n't care too much about us at all . As I got older things started changing . I did n't realize that I was close to my folks until after I was married , and I got drafted . When I got away from home , I felt an awful empty spot . There was a lot more feeling there than I ever knew there was . Growing up , you know there's'omcthing there , but you ca n't put your finger on it .  | Safe Return Home does not necessarily imply an overly idealized conceptio of the parents ' marriage . Gil remembers some tensions : I knew that spats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard he as a truck driver , she in a factory and they were tired , and it did n't take very much to set off a fuse . They were working long hours and the wages were n't that great . Despite some quarrels over money , their marriage has nevertheless been positive model : I did look forward to getting married . I looked forward to having a nice home , and a nice person to be good to my kids , keep things straight , and if necessary work along with me to help get us through ? more or less the same lifestyle that I had been used to , my mother and father out working . Gil 's first attempt was short-lived . He married a casual girlfriend after she became pregnant , and when the draft called him away she wrote him that " she did n't want to be tied down . " Following their divorce she gave up custody of the child , not to Gil but to his parents . Before long Gil remarried , this time to his childhood sweetheart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outset of his second marriage : " The only thing that was surprising was being so content . " His contentment was surely aided by how easily this marriage could be intertwined with their respective families of origin . " Even when we were dating we more or less stayed at her place or we 'd come down to my folks and visit , " a pattern that has continued throughout their ten years of marriage . His parents ' custody of his first child seemed to solidify his Safe Return Home : My mother has custody of my daughter from the first marriage . I can see her whenever I want to . She stays here a lot of weekends , and we 're always down to Mom 's and Dad 's , so I know she 's being brought up right . . . . My parents were more than willing to have custody , since my daughter had lived with them ever since she was born . To my mother and father she seems just like one of theirs . Notice how once again , the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Safe Return I Ionic , even under these unconventional circumstances . Some respondents seemed to hold this marriage agenda precisely because their own home was not safe , and they yearned to create for themselves a secure family haven through their partner ' family . IId Stern , the man who remembers his home as " the kind of pl.t r where people came to do battle with one another , " speaks of how he dealt with the situation : " I became very  | independent as a youngster and moved in my own circles , as kind of a protective situation . " One of his agendas for marriage was thus colored by deficiency motivation , by the need to fill the deficit of emotional security and safety : I just had an image of security , that I would n't be alone anymore , that there would be somebody who I could trust and who could really care for me as a person . It was something that I really desperately needed , too , and I saw a marriage relationship as providing that . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that was important to me . I remember relating as well to her family as I did to her . I felt very comfortable with her family and they with me , and so the whole thing kind of came together as a replacement for something I did n't have , growing up . And her family had acceptance in the society that they existed in . I never felt my family had acceptance from the community they lived in , from neighbors ; there was hardly ever anybody in my house . There were very few friends that I can remember . I was looking for greater depth in a family relationship and found that in my wife 's family . Clearly , Hal saw in his wife 's family a safe arrival home , given that his own family did not lend itself to the notion of a safe return home . Right after marriage , he found his first home in an upstairs room of his wife 's parents ' household , and while he remembers wanting more privacy and a place of their own , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to be comfortably enmeshed in a tight family circle . As with most marriage agendas , Safe Return Home does not focus on needs within the partnership-corner per se but looks to a third-corner to shore up the foundations of individual security . For many people , partnership alone is too empty a concept in which to invest one 's adult sustenance , either because they witnessed too many failed relationships or simply because they lacked any model that could lend concreteness to the notion of partnership as a self-contained frontier , which is the modern " therapeutic " conception of marriage . In many respects , " marriage " is always a code word for adult security , and because dependence on only one person increases feelings of vulnerability , people tend to translate " marriage " into something more than partnership alone . Safe Return Home , with its focus on kin-based thirdcorners , is only one of several such translations . As we shall now see , the other marriage agendas are also translations of partnership into larger commitments and obligations , though the particular third-corner focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people see their marriage as a Religious Calling . They want to align their marriage with the convictions and principles drawn from their church or creed .  | There are several pathways that can lead to this marriage agenda . For some of my respondents whose home life was comfortable , a marriage with religior at its center was modeled in their family of origin . An engineer , married twenty years , immediately translated a question I asked him about his parents ' marriage into a statement about their family life and religion : I do n't ever remember any problems with their marriage . We did everything together . My father , when he was a boy , had to walk five miles or so to get to Sunday school , and he never missed a Sunday .... So as we were growing up our parents always took us to church and Sunday school . They never left it to us to decide if we wanted to go or not . They went with us , so we always had that relationship together . And Sunday afternoon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth . For this man , embracing a religious-centered marriage meant referring to religious standards as the only rightful guides to conduct both for marriage and for courtship . I asked whether his courtship was a high-intensity sort of experience or more low key . He spoke of a time when the physical attraction between them began to grow more intense and how religious principles overruled their sexual desires : As we were growing up we were both going to church . We were both involved at this time in a youth group , and our parents and the people in the church were all brought up not to compromise but to believe the Bible and believe that what it says is absolute . That was what you set your standard by , not by what other people were doing or because if-it-feels-good , - do- it . So we always had a good guide to decide for ourselves whether what we were doing was beyond the limits of what God wanted for us . Some respondents arrive at a religious agenda for marriage through rejecting their familiar paradigm , not through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoiding the Demon as a plan for marriage . Morris Gorman , who was mentioned as wanting to avoid divorce and extramarital intimacies after having spent most of his childhood in a succession of foster homes , spoke of having had " some false notions " prior to his religious conversion : I had Satanic notions . And then I decided , here I am , I 'm seventeen , and if I want to end up the way my father did I can continue . It was n't so much my behavior but my attitude . I scented to have a guardian angel . I could n't seem to find the type of behavior I was looking for , the activities I wanted to get into . So the missionaries of the church came along , and I wanted to emulate them . I said , well , if I want to he like them then I have to follow their way of life , and if I want to end up the way my parents have , then I can continue their way . So I made that decasum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude and my thinking and my outlook on life , and so that 's when I joined the Church . . . . About a month before that I was out one night and I drove into the restaurant and saw the guys . They said , " Come on , we 've got a hot broad over here in cabin 8 . You want to go out ? " I goes out , and I was very abrupt . I opened the door , and I took my clothes off , and I says , " Let 's go . " They 'd been banging her all day ? it was about two in the morning ? she was n't in any mood to have any more callers . And I thought , " What the hell is this anyway ? Is this what I want out of life ? " From that day on I decided maybe I 'd do something different in life . Armed with new-found religious principles , Morris indeed did " something different . " He found a woman who shared his religious faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to repeat the sexually promiscuous pattern of his mother , the pattern that ( at least in his own mind ) had led to his earlier abandonment to foster homes : In the church we have a lot of qualities that we look for : a person with a strong conviction in their religious beliefs , and a person that has a strong conviction of the Savior and the teachings of the church , and is willing to live them and not question them . The Lord indicated to me that Becky was the one ; it was nothing flashy , the Lord just pointed her out to me . I just had a warm feeling . A third pathway to marriage as a Religious Calling also entails a conversion experience or at least an intensification of religious commitments , only it occurs after the marriage has been formed . Here , Religious Calling is paired neither with avoiding some demon nor with Safe Return Home , although in some instances the person may have had considerable religious exposure as a child . The essential fact is that religious principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and future marital events and for coming to terms with the meaning of one 's life . Faith Dickson , a respondent married fifty-three years , told me that she sees two basic phases that her marriage has gone through ? a ten-year period of frequent though unexpressed resentments followed by a forty-three-year period in which her principal focus has been , in her words , " to know and do the will of God . " I think that I really was a selfish person when I was first married . I was always thinking of what he should do for me instead of what I should do for him . When things did n't go my way I became resentful . And my husband is a very bright engineer , and I think he made me feel inferior . I think it was his attitude . He 's very quick , and some of us do not learn as quickly as he does . His tone of voice ? if you did n't understand something right away ? would show you that he was impatient and thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave me that feeling . Then when I read these devotional  | books it made me absolutely realize that Jesus loves me , even if I 'm not as brilliant as Stuart is . Stuart is an impatient man , and I have had to learn to live with that . . . . I think you have to learn to accept the person as he is and to appreciate him . . . . It was not until I read these books that I began to see my faults . See , I was blaming him for everything that happened . . . . Later , I do n't know as he even knew that I felt better . We never did quarrel much . I would just close up and not say anything . I never told him my real feelings , which was bad . Notice how , in Faith 's account , there is no indication that Stuart 's impatieno or any other of his previously objectional behaviors ever changed . When mar riage becomes a Religious Calling , one has a new frame of reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauging the rightness o one 's own behavior , and this development need not entail a single change it any of the externals . In some instances , however , when this agenda is adoptec by both partners together , there may be profoundly dynamic changes in boll of their partnership-corners . Such is the case whenever the new religious principles actually direct the couple to perfect their marriage so it can serve as ar instrument of God 's will . This situation is especially fostered by the Marriage Encounter movement , and will be discussed later . Economic Calling In American culture all adults must in some way be concerned with their economic status . A " living " is something we " make " through " earning , " and this earning is held to be each family 's private problem . In this sense every marriage is an economic enterprise . For some people , however , earning a living seems to be elevated into the defining essence of what a marriage is . It is as if the very purpose of intimate partnership is to jointly accumulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be marked by the major purchases that stand as tangible milestones . For these people , marriage is an Economic Calling . Such people were sometimes recognizable through their eagerness to show or tell me about their most prized possessions , or to recount the sequence of job advancements that made these purchases possible . In no case did I ask for the elaborate information about consumer spending or job mobility that I sometimes got , although I did seek minimal descriptions of a person 's job history . What was so striking was the tendency of some respondents to spontaneously translate questions I asked them about different phases of their marriage into statements about their economic changes of fortune . Men who strongly identify with the breadwinner or provider notion of a husband 's role were especially likely to make this kind of translation , and to have begun to do so even at the beginning of courtship . 11c-re is a respondent who immediately makes the economic translation , when I asked about his courtship :  | It was a lot of fun , although there was n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week from the service , and there was very little work available . I did a few crazy things . She loved dogs and I bought her a registered cocker spaniel for $35 , which was a lot of money for me then . Another time she saw a quilt she wanted that was $15 , and I had $17 in my pocket and I bought it for her . And that 's pretty much the way things have been . Of course after we got married she knew what the finances were and would n't ask for something we could n't afford , but for the most part whatever she 's wanted I 've gotten for her . It sounds like it 's been very important to you to provide materially for your wife . Absolutely . I think that 's reflected in this home that we have . I built this house . I drove every damned nail in it . I 've taken a great deal of pride in everything I have here , and I think that a great deal of that stems from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to have what I can afford to have . " I did without so much in my younger years " ? the inner feeling of many of the men who see marriage as an Economic Calling . A number of these respondents grew up in an atmosphere of privation , whatever the actual facts were of their parents ' economic situation . Accordingly , they bring to their marriage some pressing deficiency needs that focus on material progress as the only way to fill the deficit . Economic Calling is then the remedy for Avoiding the Demon of privation . The man just quoted was born in 1929 , and remembers his parents being " preoccupied with trying to eke out a living . " We grew up on a farm and had hired men living with us at times . My father and mother both worked in a shoe factory . We had a few head of cattle , a few horses , about 100 chickens and a couple of pigs , mainly for our own use . Dad had about a five-acre garden . They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it is to do without , but we never went hungry . I wanted to do more for Margie and my children than obviously my parents were able to do for me . Another man , born the year after this one , tells a similar story : If my children had to live their childhood the way my wife and I did , then things would have been a lot different for them : hand-me-down clothes , corn chowder , potato soup , oatmeal for supper , things like that . But I had what I considered a happy childhood . When I was real young there was only one man in the family that was working , and the whole family lived together . When I was in kindergarten I came to school on snowshoes.  | Who was in the household ? My grandmother , my great-aunt and - uncle , their son , my mother 's brother and his wife and child , my folks , and me and my brother . This was in ' 34 , ' 35 , ' 36 during the Depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being in the right place in the line waiting for work . The rest of us lived off the farm . You counted heads for Sunday dinner and then you went out in the chicken coop and picked out the biggest rooster ! We never went hungry . We always had clothes to wear . We did n't wear shoes in the summertime ; no one did . I can remember when I was six years old going up into the woods to help gather firewood . We burned wood ? we had three big woodburning stoves in the house . The family used to go hunting . We had cows , we had a horse . Things that kids do n't have now . This man remembers a happy childhood , and he thinks his parents had a ver good marriage . But he naturally brought to his own marriage a keen sense o the precariousness of economic safety . I asked him about any expectations h may have had for his marriage : Nothing would be wasted . And even now it disturbs me to see things wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kids now have no idea what they can do with a dollar . . . . I think Tess probably represented everything I expected in a woman . She could cook ; she could sew ? she was a pretty girl , too . She did n't strike me as anyone who would be wasteful with things . I asked , " How do you remember your first year of marriage , " and almost im mediately he translated my question into a series of economic statements : That 's when the daughter was born . We had a three-room apartment . I was bringing home just under $40 a week . We had all brand-new furniture ? we had been paying for it for about a year before we were married , so we had it pretty well paid for . We had a car that we owned . We had a new refrigerator . We were paying rent , paying our utilities and heat , and we were putting money in the bank . For the most part , the men in my sample who see marriage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are prout homeowners who are living out the American dream of active membership it the consumer society . But even when they have become quite affluent , the ) seem to retain a vision of marriage that puts it to the service of relieving theii basic sense of economic deficiency and insecurity . Not the objective reality but the subjective sensibility makes the difference here . Regardless of hoH safe from absolute privation people may he , they are often measuring theii progress by comparison with those around them . Preoccupied with economic  | standards of comparison , people may feel safe if they can simply avoid privation , but if they are to feel esteemed in their own and others ' eyes , they may need to accomplish some rather virtuoso economic performances . Here is a man thirty-four years of age , married thirteen years , a manager for an industrial firm , and the son of a tool- and die-maker , talking about his wife 's family : I felt a strong sense of competition from her dad and her brothers . To this day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks it 's silly of me to feel that way . Janet 's dad was very successful ; I ca n't think of anything he 's done wrong . He flew airplanes , which is a fond dream of mine which I 've never been able to do . He was a pilot during World War II , was shot down twice ? a hero . Then he came back after the war and got a job , and very quickly moved up in the business , and had a beautiful house and a swimming pool and a twin-engine airplane . And her older brother was pretty much in the same mold , a very competitive individual . Financially he made the right decisions all the time ; he flew an airplane . Her younger brother , he 's a pilot in the navy . He 's probably of the three of them going to be the best . ... It 's a very athletic family . So I always felt that I had to do at least as well as they did , or I would be letting my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain point to this day . This man has already risen far above the level of earning and consumption of his own father , but that level is no longer his benchmark for measuring his own economic progress . When he was eighteen his father died , and at that point Janet 's father " took me under his wing , because of my dad not being around . " Given his craving for parental guidance , it then became easy to adopt Janet 's father 's model of financial success . Clearly , the standard of economic deprivation is a relative one , as sociologists have long pointed out . At every level of the socio-economic hierarchy , marriage may become an Economic Calling , and people at each stratum will be making different kinds of comparisons in order to determine whether they are more or less " worthy " than those around them . Women , too , may see their marriage as an Economic Calling , even when their husband alone is responsible for generating the family finances . I asked fifty-year-old Sandy , a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt her marriage was in some way special compared to the marriages of other couples she and her husband Billy know . Notice how she immediately translated my question into economic realities : The people we see out here ? I certainly do think our marriage is special . They 're very content with nothing . If you could see the people around here you 'd know . What they have in the house is nothing . And they have no ambition to try to make it better ! They 're satisfied to live like that . We 're always trying to have something a little hit better . This couple we 've known about maybe a month or so ? she comes over , and my God , she never knows enough  | to go home ; she 'll sit for hours and hours and hours ! This is something that I would n't want , and Billy 's not like that either . Billy does n't want to sit around and waste his time when there 's so much you could be doing ! But they have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one couple that 's living on meager social security , but a few days after his check comes he 's always up here wanting to borrow money or wanting cigarette money . Ther 's a limit to how much you can endure . But rather than say anything , we give him sixty cents . This is what Billy and I see in other couples : lack of ambition for one thing . I learned my lesson with those two , and I 'm not about to branch out and ask any more to be friendly . She tells another story about a woman who borrows and never pays anything back . This is how we feel different from a lot of people , in that we can make our money stretch to pay for what we need , and we do n't have to beg from others . For the Children The vast majority of American people want to have children once they marry . All fifty-seven of the couples I interviewed either bore children themselves or adopted them . Most of them knew even before they met their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage . In this sense , it could be said that For the Children is a marriage agenda held by all my respondents . For most of these couples , however , For the Children is not the defining essence of marriage but takes its place among an assortment of images that help define what a marriage is . When asked , " What notions did you have about marriage ? " , one woman replied : " I 've always been a romantic . Marriage , family ? babies ! I was one of those kids that always played with dolls . " Her three children have no doubt fulfilled this part of her vision of marriage , but it is also clear that her vision included a lot more . When her husband became , in her words , a " shiny new minister who was going out to slay dragons in the world , " he became less and less accessible to her and their first child . It was n't exactly the way I thought it was going to be . I was kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be around a lot . . . . Yes , I did confront him . I do n't know where I got the courage ; I never had any . I guess it meant enough so that I knew we just had to back up and look at things again . . . . I discovered that I had some things that were important to me . I was n't willing to share so much of him with other people . Her husband 's testimony confirmed her own . i lc conceded , " I was a pompous ass , like anybody who just comes out of seminary and believes God has peculiarly ordained him to solve the world 's problems . And my wife was shut up in a horrible apartment . "  | I shall not dwell on couples like this one , for whom marriage comes to mean something more than raising children , however important that may be . Rather , I shall focus on those respondents who seem to turn child rearing into a sort of mission and marriage into a vehicle whose overriding purpose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this sense , seems to have several possible origins . For some respondents this agenda is an outgrowth of rejecting the paradigm modeled by their parents . Thinking that one or both of their parents made grievous errors in their own upbringing , they are determined to correct these errors through providing different experiences for their children . It is as if child rearing provides an opportunity to relive their own childhood . By becoming the kind of parents they never had , they might vicariously become the kind of child they never could be . A respondent named Louise Miller said that her father was so engrossed in his work that he spent little time with her , " and this certainly played a part in my looking at people in terms of who I might marry . " For her , the focus was not on mothering differently than her own mother but in finding a husband who would be a different kind of parent than her own father . When I was thinking about getting married , I was very eager to have a family and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could climb into his lap and snuggle up to him , who was around to do things with them on a continuing basis , who would deal with them like real , live people from the day they were born . My husband is very unusual . Ask a dozen people in Portland who Superdaddy is and they 'll say " Jake Miller . " ... My father did not have a lot of that sensitivity toward children ; I do n't think he really thinks of children as people until they 're able to carry on an intellectual conversation , or play a game at his level . At this point in the interview , Louise provided a recent instance of her father having the kind of interaction with her children that demonstrates his lack of sensitivity to them . Clearly , the unspoken message behind the story ? indeed , behind much of her vision of marriage ? is that her father failed to be sensitive to her in some important ways . Just how much pain and anguish she had to endure in consequence is not clear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may feel . What is clear to her is that where her own children are concerned , she and her husband will make any necessary sacrifices as a couple so that their presumed needs will be met . The overwhelming reason why I think we 're as happy as we are is because , when it came down to the decision to have and to be involved with children , we 've both , independently , almost always reached the same conclusion when it comes to " what are we going to do with this block of time ? " If I 'd like to spend a day playing golf with him , and he 'd like that too , we both almost invariably decide that what we really ought to he doing is spending the day  | with the children . We do n't have those kinds of incompatibilities which I see among some friends we have . We put our children first . We both do it together . We may think there 's time for us to play golf alone , but we 'd rather teach our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We want to do things with our kids . We opt to vacation with them . My job right now is to see that these kids get the best possible start in life that we can give them ; and he feels exactly the same way . And that makes the difference in our marriage . Louise 's husband Jake did not feel " exactly " the same way , for reasons th ; will be explored in another context , but his account did square essential with hers . And he provided additional information that showed just ho ' singlemindedly this couple structures their marriage For the Children . For ea ample , their relationships with other couples must eventually come to rest o those couples ' values about children . I asked , " When you see marriages the lack what yours has , what 's lacking ? " Jake replied : A sufficient commitment to the kids , to helping the kids get through things . What both of us focus on when looking at other people , in terms of whether we will spend time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we draw a lot of conclusions about people from how they treat their kids and get along with their kids . Religious commitments also get made on the basis of the presumed needs c the children . " I 'm very atheist , " Jake told me , " but we go to a Protestan church . I 'm not sure how religious Louise really is , but she thought it was good influence for the kids , and I agree , so we go without my having an strong commitment . I like the routine , and I like to sing . " Louise 's accoun was similar : " I feel very strongly that the children should have some sort a religious training . We are pursuing it for that reason . If we did n't have kids we might not be pursuing it at this particular time . " Louise and Jake represent an almost pure case of For the Children as marriage agenda , certainly the purest case in my sample . To be sure , al couples with children find themselves periodically structuring their marriag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family is large any when at least one child is still a preschooler . A woman whose three childrei range from age six to eleven put it this way : I read once where somebody said , " If you have to pick between your husband and your children , you should pick your husband . " And I feel that in a sense that 's true . But when the children are small , they need you . Maybe if your children are teenagers or adults , then yes , your husband should definitely come first in all instances . We both feel that most of the time the kids come first because they need to come first .  | It may well be that in the more active child-rearing phase of each family 's life cycle , For the Children tends to take center stage as the dominant marriage agenda for most couples , certainly for most wives . Nevertheless , there is still a difference between marrying for the children and marrying for the partnership , even when , in the latter instance , the prerogatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children 's needs . Here , I shall stick to those former cases in which people are eager to translate marriage into a set of parental obligations to their children . A common origin of this agenda is the arising of a sense of disillusionment about how the couple relationship is going . It is as if the person says , " My partner can not or will not be there for me ; therefore my domestic life will focus on my children . " The marriage may have been formed for the partnership , but when that falters and divorce or separation is not a serious consideration , For the Children comes to be the defining essence of the marriage . This outcome will be more likely of course , if the person 's parents also modeled a marriage that revolved around children , in which case it may become easy to fall into that familiar paradigm in response to an inaccessible spouse . Women are especially likely to adopt this agenda wherever traditional cultural patterns still govern the prevailing assumptions about what it means to be a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her duty to rest content with maintaining the home , raising the children , and supporting the husband 's total absorption in his independent third-corners , even at the expense of any intimate couple partnership . Ruby Nelson , a forty-eight-year-old woman , married for thirty years to a man whose job often kept him out of town during the week , recalls some disillusionment when she realized that her husband Greg had so little time for her : Greg is very ambitious . When he does something for his career , he puts his whole heart and soul into it . After I had my second child they have four I kind of felt neglected , and I was a little unhappy . I always seemed to come down at the bottom , and I was stuck right at home . This caused a few little heartaches . I kept arguing with myself , trying to convince myself that it did n't matter . I just felt I always came last . In time Ruby grew resigned to Greg 's minimal daily involvement with her and their children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her need for some companionship : I think I 've leaned on my children an awful lot ; I 've depended on them , especially as they got older . When Greg would be off somewhere and I had something to discuss or some problem , and I had no one to talk to , they were always here just to put my arm around them and give them a kiss , or tell them I love them , or squeeze their hand , or go to a basketball game . . . . I just feel that Greg 's missed so much , being away so much because they 're only young once , and then they 're gone . My children have been a big part of my life .  | In one form or another this scenario was recounted over and over again by women in my sample . But it should not be thought that marriage For th ( Children is something that women do only as a secondary response to an in accessible husband . There are enormous cultural pressures that coax womer to throw themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands are . A number of men complained that their wives ' absorption in the children was above and beyond the call of duty , and they fell that their wives stood less ready than they did for intimate partnership once children came . Clearly , women who have no career or other meaningful third-corners may come to see in children their best chance as a married person to have something important of their own . And for women who come to marriage lacking a solid sense of self-esteem , child rearing may seem the only way to fill the void . " I felt more a member of society , " one woman told me . " I took great delight in my baby , and I felt more comfortable in a way , more relaxed , more accepted in the eyes of the world . " Her husband spoke frankly about his own feelings : My wife is an excellent and perfect mother . My daughter Helen was always absolutely clean and perfectly cared for , and I think I probably felt a lot of jealousy , a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . N.y wife could almost be offensive about it , to the extent of saying , " Helen is everything to me , and you 're nothing . " She has actually said that to me . She might come back later and say " I did n't mean it , " but I did get that message for a long time . . . . When she became a mother she was something entirely different than that soft , very feminine companion that I wanted in my fantasy of a wife . She was this creature who was walking around with pins stuck in her shirt , totally absorbed in being a mother . I heard no accounts of men having this same level of singleminded absorption in their children ; when one thing alone is their " baby , " it is typically work . What I did hear from several men was their crediting the ongoing presence of children as the basis of their marriage 's durability , given that the strength of the couple relationship alone would not have been enough to sustain it . A handyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would want to go around the world this year and go someplace else next year . I think she could travel the rest of her life . I do n't want to go down the end of the street . We have different thoughts on a lot of things . She said one kid would have been enough , and when she gets mad , she wishes she did n't have any . And I would n't have been able to survive without them ? just us two . You have to have something to do in between everything else , and the kids fall in that role with me . I enjoyed every minute of it ? two a.m. feeding , it did n't matter . Maybe because I can think on their level I can relate to them .  | Another man , married twelve years , thought that the arrival of children had driven his wife and him apart but had also kept their marriage together at the same time : Every kid was another phase , I guess , another headache to a certain degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of them for nothing , but you 'd get tied down a little bit more . She changed quite a bit . Her patience was gone . And we did n't sit down , we did n't talk . I 'd stay up late ; she 'd go to bed early . We basically just stopped going out as much . If the kids were n't around , I do n't think we 'd be together , just because I think we would have parted over something small . Has either of you ever mentioned the possibility of divorce or separation ? Yeah , in an argument . Her , more so than me . Does it end with the argument , or does it come up again ? It comes up in another argument . Not for a long time . The kids have kept us together . Plus I wo n't leave ; I 've got no place to go . I do n't know why we stay together . There 's love there , but some of the fights we 've had have been enough to split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run , marriage For the Children is by itself an unstable agenda . Children grow up and move out , so eventually the couple is left alone again . The man just quoted has three children , none of whom are yet ten years of age . As they get older and then leave , his marriage relationship will surely change . Either the " love there " that he spoke of will be renewed , or the accumulated gaps and resentments between him and his wife will drive them further apart . Whatever the outcome , it will be fed in large part by both of their stances toward their familiar marital paradigms . ' Safe Haven Some people see marriage as a comfortable old shoe that can provide a homey and tension-free refuge from the outside world . Marriage is not the main platform from which these people launch their struggle for growth and achievement . Rather , it is a Safe Haven to which they can retreat and get recharged , enabling them to return to the all-important outside struggle with replenished vigor . This agenda differs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's continuous influence of one or both spouses ' extended family network . Indeed , the Safe-I Liven agenda , with its typical emphasis on career achievement ,  | often removes both spouses from any intense kin activity , just because career advancement so often requires that people relocate far away from their famiilies of origin . While Safe Return Home tends to be a working-class phenomenon , with generation after generation often laboring for the same local employer , Safe Haven is more often a middle-class agenda , held by those whose occupational chances are considerable enough that they can willingly forsake the security of their extended family ties . Safe Haven bears a resemblance to marriage as an Economic Calling . In both agendas the issue of what should be happening in the partnership itself gets subordinated or at least referred to some central third-corner away from the partnership . With Economic Calling , that third-corner interest is success at earning an income and accumulating the material possessions that mark one 's progress . With Safe Haven the occupational activity itself ? the course of one 's career development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions earned in the process may become important , but they tend to be more taken for granted . Social class backgrounds make some ( but not all ) the difference . As mentioned earlier , people who see marriage as an Economic Calling are usually upwardly mobile from working-class backgrounds , quite happy to be participating more actively in the consumer society than their parents could . Their Safe Haven counterparts usually come from middle- and uppermiddle-class backgrounds , where parents teach children that an occupation should be deeply meaningful , and that one can only measure one 's worth by the scope of the contribution one can make to one 's occupation . Regardless of the amount of income earned , if a career is not deeply meaningful or challenging , it should be abandoned for the sake of one that is . Still , some of the respondents who had this sense of devotion to the inner meaning of their work came from family backgrounds that were more solidly working class than middle class . As youngsters , several of these respondents sought refuge from tensions at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily fed into success in school , then entrance into the world of college , and finally , involvement in a career that offered the same measure of absorption as did intellectual pursuits as a child . Frank O'Brien , the professor who grew up in an Italian and Irish workingclass neighborhood , escaped his parents ' alcoholic and conflict-ridden world through reading . I 've been an intense reader all my life . The reading child was probably committed to the priesthood by half the families in my neighborhood ; that was part of the reason I ran off to the navy . My models were n't from inside my family culture ; they came from literature as much as anything . From the navy he went to college and then graduate school , where his intellectual interests crystallized into a career . Science and politics have always  | dominated his interests as a married person , while marriage is a tension-free space in which to rest and relax . Emotional intensity is to be avoided , as in his mind it probably leads to the explosive confrontations his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her calming influence : I get rather stormy , and Laura is calming . Emotionally I found a lot of support in marriage . It was nice to have someone you could be stormy with and who would not take offense . I found marriage a secure haven from the very beginning . . . . What we do together is not exotic ; it 's beach-walking , collecting specimens , reading in the same room . We both enjoy eating and cooking . We are sports fans . We go to football , basketball , and hockey games together . We do n't feel a need for anything else . We do n't need any wild emotional climaxes . We 're mutually supportive , and that 's enough for us . Another man learned to seek in books a much needed refuge from his overbearing father , a railroad brakeman : My father was quite dominant and I found it difficult to do things right for him . In fact , that ultimately drove me into situations in which he had no knowledge ; there was no way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through high school , spent five years to get his diploma . . . . I learned that book knowledge and working in areas that he knew nothing about brought me more joy , because they did n't bring with them the problem of him being able to tell me that there 's a better way of doing this . This man became deeply involved in a demanding navy career , and his agenda for marriage was that it should comfortably fit into a life-style that took him away from home for even months at a time . A second pathway to career-absorption and marriage as a Safe Haven , among those from working-class backgrounds , does not begin with the need of some refuge from tensions at home , as does the first one . Rather , it entails one or both parents helping to steer the individual into directions that later lead to upward mobility and career-mindedness . Scott King , an English professor whose father had had a whole array of working-class jobs , from farmer to butcher to painter and paper-hanger , described his early home life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close " not only to both his parents but also to many aunts , uncles , and all of his grandparents . These are conditions which , for many working-class boys , would culminate in a marriage as a Safe Return Home ? as described earlier . Indeed , in speaking about the different direction that he chose to move in , Scott seems to sense very clearly the type of life he had to give up in the process : By the time I was thinking about marriage , I was already beginning to think about no longer living in that area an area he describes as " extreme rural  | isolation " ) . I was thinking about pursuing intellectual life in some form . I was already looking for a marriage that would have a high intellectual quality , a continuous intellectual quality . That was one thing that I wanted that was different from my parents ' marriage . On the other hand , I really did like the concept of the closeness they had with their brothers , their sisters , mothers , fathers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't repeated it much , but I still look at it with a great deal of fondness . It 's something that , if I had an opportunity , might have been useful . It was Scott 's mother who apparently influenced him to forsake that life for a more intellectual one : My mother was intellectually stronger than my father was . She read more than he did . She had a good deal more catholic taste . She was a fairly accomplished musician , belonged to a fairly good musical society , and played ... . My mother 's father , although he did n't go to college , was a good musician in his own right . He was a strong believer in intellectual values . He introduced me to Dickens , for instance , when I was twelve . He had read most of the great world 's classics . Whatever the social class origins of people who hold this marriage agenda , they can often be recognized through their tendency to translate questions about the phases of their marriage into statements about their career history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost in terms of career accomplishments , they find it difficult to recall how their marriage was going at a given period of time without first anchoring themselves in the memory of where they were in their career development . I asked a history professor if his twenty-five-year marriage has gone through any phases . He began by speaking of the " graduate school experience , where you almost have to be selfish in order to get through . " When I asked him when this first phase of his marriage ended and the next one began , it became clear that the graduate school pattern of intensive career preparation extended full steam into his actual career activity . " Sheila was always involved with the children and I was busy this , busy that . I was a good family man in the sense of being a provider , but I did n't really have as much time for Sheila and the family as I do now . " Most of my respondents who see their marriage as a Safe Haven and their career interests at the center of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men with fathers who had both successful careers and comfortable , low-key marriages were especially likely to embrace this paradigm for themselves . The model that they have internalized , often without any direct teaching from their parents , is that a man gains esteem from others and can feel good about himself through career achievements . To he sure , many men were aware of having missed out , as children or adolescents , on  | the attention they craved from their career-absorbed fathers . " He spent very little time with us , " one man told me , echoing the account of many others : We ended up with Mother a lot more . When he was available to do things , the things he did did not include the family . I 'm not sure I had any judgments at that time , but I do now . Maybe I might have felt irritated , a little left out . . . . Several memories jump to mind from my early childhood , and one of them was my mother going , " Shh ! Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father leaving him out , it was apparently not enough to prevent him from falling into his familiar paradigm , once he married and was trying to finish up his college degree : I very quickly learned that wife and children can get in the way of doing the things that you want to do . I moved to the periphery of the situation . When our first child Ellie arrived , her bedroom and my study were the same room . That term I almost flunked out . During the break I realized I was being interrupted every time Ellie cried a little bit . I 'd say , " Jane , Ellie 's mumbling , " and it would break my line of thought . My solution to the problem was to rent a cheap room elsewhere in the building , and I proceeded to go there to study . Even when men had had strained relations with their fathers , and wound up rejecting a lot of the tendencies their fathers had modeled , devotion to a career seems to be the last element of the model to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen years , spoke of his father 's impact : We had a stormy interaction , a conflict of values . I was people-oriented and he was thing-oriented and very strong-willed . He was a contractor and builder who never completed high school . But he was a person of quality ; he looked for excellence in craftsmanship , and he was known for being a craftsman in the renovation of older homes . I did n't have a very positive relationship with my father . He was n't interested in much that I was doing as a kid . I played football until my junior year , and his attitude was that I could be working with him if I was n't engaged in sports . He felt that one should be working rather than recreating . A lot of that is still in me . Anything I gained from my father is in terms of work and the quest for excellence . Did you have notions of what marriage would be like , before you met Gail ? Yes . The role of the wife that I observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , spending a lot of time taking care of the home , etcetera . . . . My mother had to be home when my father came for lunch , and if ever she had to be away , she left everything all prepared for him . That 's quite an extreme from where Gail and I are . But early on , that was my image of a wife .  | Later , I asked Brian , " What in your current life gives you the most satisfaction ? " He replied without hesitation : My job . At times I catch myself , remembering my father who worked so hard that at the end of the day he did n't have time for me , and I play golf with the kids or something like that . I 'd like to think of myself as getting more satisfaction from the family , but I really have n't put as much time in on the family as I have on the job . Learning to temper my life and take more time off for recreation is something I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge out of my work . I never find it boring . It was not only men who reported such high levels of devotion to their careers . Many women also had career-focussed lives , as did Gail Jordan , the wife of the man just quoted , the same man whose mother always had to be home to serve his father lunch . Gail got a Ph.D . of her own . Here she describes the family strategy that she thinks makes it all work : We 're in the process of applying for license plates , and we want them to say " WIN ? WIN , " because we 've tried to make that a motto for our family . It 's been increasingly more difficult when you get more players , now that we have five children . There might be a period of time when it would be WIN ? LOSE . When Brian went into his doctoral degree , I really played support all the way . I had some problems with that at the time , but then we reversed it , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the beginning of it , I think . Now , whenever we have a decision and a problem facing us , we call a family meeting , and we try and make it WIN ? WIN . And if it is WIN ? LOSE , it will only be that way for a certain period of time , and then we 'll reverse it . Having gotten her Ph.D. , Gail became top administrator for a lucrative grant . Brian describes the impact on their lives : How that affected the marriage is that Gail has taken on all the things I do n't like in myself , in terms of working . She goes off at 8:30 a.m. , before I do . Our youngest goes to the children 's center here and that 's worked out well . Gail brings home a lot of work now . She 's very much involved in her job . She always was the balance for me , saying , " Do n't work that hard , " and now I do n't have that check . We used to belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of golf clubs in an effort to get me to relax . The most frustrating thing for me now is that I wish Gail were n't so wrapped up in her job . But I can understand it , in that it 's the first major challenge she 's had since earning her doctorate , and it 's exciting for her . I 'm proud of her for her achievements , but it 's been exasperating . To some , it may seem foolish to see this marriage as a Safe Haven or as a marriage at all , given the fact that both partners seem so single-mindedly  | devoted to their work . To be sure , I spoke with several career-devoted people for whom marriage could not have been described as a haven , career being the only meaningful sanctuary in their lives . But not so for Gail and Brian . Safe Haven may indeed mean a lot of career-absorption , but it does not spell a lack of caring and concern for the marriage as we shall see when we look at the Jordans in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer with a fifty-year marriage , spoke candidly about her own intense ambition and then about the haven-like elements of her marriage without seeing any serious conflicts between career and marriage : It made a big difference when I started doing so much travelling and writing , because I have a different life for myself . We 've adjusted to that pretty well . I 've been gone for long periods of time , all over the world . . . . He has n't enjoyed my being away , but it 's been fortunate that I could do all this , because I 'm ambitious ? much more than Roger is ? and self-centered , and selfish . I like to write and make a name for myself ; both are very important to me . If I had n't been able to do this , I would n't have been happy . It may have meant some sacrifice to him , having me away so much . . . . Sometimes I wonder what I 'll be like in the future , when I do n't have all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I know I 'd be completely lost if anything happened to Roger . For one thing , there would n't be anybody to share anything with . We have the comradeship , the understanding . I would n't have anybody left ; I 'm the last of my line . You need somebody who loves you and cares about you . Caring is so important in a marriage , particularly if you do n't have brothers and sisters , like me . Finally , to see marriage and family as a Safe Haven is not to see it as the only possible haven in a heartless world . The world outside may often seem difficult and intractable , but one 's career efforts can suffuse it with ample " heart " ; one can depend upon one 's own talent and competence to negotiate one 's way through the outside world with a sense of confidence and even comfort . Safe Haven , then , does not necessarily imply that the outside world is unsafe . The safety in this view of marriage inheres in the opportunity simply to relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a little from the gravity of all the meaningful work that awaits one 's return . Hedged Bet Some people come reluctantly to marriage . They are willing to enter it even while they retain grave doubts about its workability . Their doubts are nagging enough that they need to keep some emotional distance from marriage , as if their investment will backfire the moment they step closer than arm 's length to the naked reality of partnership . To protect themselves , they adopt  | a life-style or at least a point of view that enables them to feel less vulnerable as a married person , should the whole thing come tumbling down . For them , marriage is a Hedged Bet ? hedged by whatever interest or philosophy they evolve to lessen the risk . If the marriage should then falter , at least they will have the hedge instead of nothing at all . Virtually all the respondents who held this agenda had negative feelings about the marriage paradigms modeled by their parents . Most of them could not comfortably identify with either their mother or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more by an apprehension of its inevitable pitfalls than by anything else . In this respect Hedged Bet resembles Avoiding the Demon , only there is a sense in which those who hold the latter agenda are more hopeful . For them , marital salvation is at hand if they can only avoid the specific folly that got their parents ( and themselves , by implication ) into trouble . In contrast , those who require a hedge to bring themselves to bet on marriage at all have a more generalized sense of difficulty surrounding the institution . They do not want to go through their adult life alone , as almost all of the rest of the world seems to marry , but they have deep-rooted suspicions about their capacity to get through the experience of marriage unscathed . A hedge then lends a certain feeling of safety by fixing their focus on a strategy of protecting themselves from marriage , once they enter into it . Perhaps the most common hedge centers on an ideal of independence that remains untarnished by marriage . The notion here is that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's freedom from being coopted by excessive responsibilities to one 's spouse . Lyle Remick , whose parents divorced when he was thirteen , formed a negative image of marriage . He recalls an unhappy early childhood with " a lot of tension and strife " that was accented by his father 's alcoholism . For him , marriage becomes hedged by an almost obsessive attachment to his own independence , about which he speaks through some strikingly vivid images : I had a strong feeling of wanting to be an independent person , a strong desire to be a bachelor . I do n't know how much of this I got from the negative marriage of my mother and father , and how much was my own character . I felt very dubious about my own ability to make my way in the world , and I certainly did n't want to be responsible for someone else along with it . I had strong feelings almost against marriage . I can remember the family going to the beach , with all the paraphernalia , when I was twelve or fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with just a comb stuck in his bathing suit and a towel and I thought , " Boy , that 's the way to go ; you 're not hampered by all this crap . " I did n't want the paraphernalia of marriage or the responsibility of it . It was something that I thought would be a nice way to be : to have it all together , to travel light and have mobility , and that 's something that I have always sought and somehow it always seems to evade me . Even at that age it occurred to Inc , " Why do you need all this paraphernalia ? "  | I mean , we probably would n't have this house if it were n't for my wife . I 'm glad we 've got it now . But I never wanted to crowd my life , if I could avoid it . Another man held to the same hedge of independence . He too witnessed his parents divorce and the fact that " they grated on each other " long before they finally parted : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down . I was the type of person that wanted to try all kinds of different stuff . My parents seemed to be tied down by each other all the time . " When he married , he remembers " a hard time adjusting to each other . " I 'd been a bachelor for a long time he did n't marry until age twenty-nine and I was used to coming and going when I felt like it and doing things when I felt like it , and doing what I felt like . I guess I carried that over . I just was n't used to having another person to coordinate with . . . . I guess I expected that it would be like it was before we got married , when you 're not with a person all day ; you 're with them a few hours at night . Then you get married and they 're there all the time . His wife of eleven years came to marriage with the same hedge of independence . Her parents have remained married , but she remembers her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laden with unexpressed grievances and bad feelings . I asked her if there was anything in their marriage that she wanted to avoid in her own . Yes . I always felt that if there were problems , I wanted them out in the open . ... I did n't want to be financially dependent on anybody ; I wanted to be able to earn my own way . . . . My mother was financially dependent on my father . She did n't have any training , any education . Even if she had wanted to go on her own way , she did n't have a choice . . . . When I was a teenager , I used to feel sorry for the girls who did n't have anything else on their minds except when they were going to get married and have children , because it tied you down and I knew it even then . I wanted to be independent . What did independence mean to you at the time ? To be able to come and go whenever I wanted to , and not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Hedged Bet had , at some point or other , serious doubts about whether they would ever marry at all . Most of them married much later than average . Given that their marriage paradigm is negative , they were in no hurry . I asked Janet Murray if she had any notions of what marriage would be like , before she met her husband Alec . Yes . I hoped that I would never have to get married ! I was n't in any rush , I really was n't . I found that I was very happy doing what I was doing . It seemed  | to be a status symbol to have relationships with the opposite sex , but that did n't concern me , because I was n't interested . I was n't thinking in terms of marriage . I always had thought that I 'd like to have a family , but as far as settling down and actually doing it , it was n't an obsession on my part . Her father , a periodic drinker , would become extremely combative at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , I 'd better say it and run like heck , or just hide . I did n't care to be around when he was like that , and made myself pretty scarce . " Apparently , Janet 's mother did not offer her much comfort either : " Her personality is such that she tends to play the role of the martyr and Goody Two-Shoes . Any infraction of the rules and she was ready for a lecture . " Feeling that her home was not a terribly safe place , Janet did her best to construct a life for herself in outside third-corners revolving around horses . " As a teenager , the biggest thing in my life was being able to have a horse and mastering horsemanship and finding rewards there , and that took me through an awful lot of rocky roads . " Janet thus was able to hedge herself from the seemingly inevitable pitfalls of intimate partnership by fixing her attention exclusively on the world of horsemanship , a world that must have felt eminently safer . When Alec appeared on the scene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development only because he was willing to have a courtship that would not interfere with her consuming third-corner interest in horses . " Courtship was n't necessarily going out . ' If I needed hay for the horse , we hauled hay . If we were going to a horse show , he 'd haul the saddles in his truck and the horses would go in the other truck . " In this way the relationship grew for six years before Janet and Alec married . Sex came very late in the courtship , she having " to subdue my thoughts and fears " and he being " very patient . " Again , the paradigm modeled by her parents offered no positive guidance at all . " Sex was never talked about . It was a dirty word . And I did n't see any affection in the family . I did n't know how to accept it , I did n't know how to give it . " I asked Janet if she ever struggled with the question of whether she was really " in love " enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what is love ? " It was something I had to answer in my own mind . And I think what I came up with was related to what I had experienced : I had a dog , I loved the dog ; I had a horse , I loved the horse . It was a feeling of caring and wanting to do the best I could for that particular animal , and I just applied it to the human , and I said , " It 's got to be the same thing . How could it be any different ? " That 's the only answer I could come up with : loving is caring . Here we have a wonderful instance of creative hedging : Horses start out in Janet 's experience as a third-corner hedge against an unhappy home . The feelings that she then generates about horses become so positive that she is  | moved to generalize them into the very setting ? marriage , family , home ? that stood in need of some hedge to begin with ! As we shall see later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to make use of her interest in horses as a kind of hedge against investing too much in marriage , but as the marriage has turned out to be more and more satisfying , the hedge-like character of this third-corner seems to recede . Most people who see marriage as a Hedged Bet not only begin with grave doubts about the workability of marriage , but they are also plagued with doubts about their own worth . Indeed , if marriage is a dubious investment , it is largely because they fear that their own deficiencies and quirks may bring the marriage to ruin . Janet was true to form in this respect . I asked her why she decided to marry : I do n't know . I did not have a very high opinion of myself . I think that Alec thought more of me than I thought of myself . And I knew that I could n't love him until I liked myself . . . . I said , " Geez , if he likes me well enough to take me , by God he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffer it out ! " He made me feel good about myself when oftentimes , if I was around my parents , they just tended to criticize . It was just a good thing . Kathy Remick told a story with similar ingredients . She too had parents with an unsatisfying marriage , one ending in divorce . They were also very critical of her , particularly her father : I think he would blame me and say things were my fault . I really wanted to get married because I wanted somebody to love me but I did n't really think that anybody would . I had no self-esteem . I expected marriage to be rocky . .... My mother 's kind of a cold person ? not really very sympathetic or understanding , and I think I had the feeling that it was weak to want to be loved and to love somebody . Both of my parents gave me that feeling . And I think it had something to do with the picture my mother presented as a woman . She was not really an emotional person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sitting at a party , and I said to him , " Gee , your eyes are so blue , " or something like that . And for some reason I repeated this remark to my mother , and she thought that was a weak , stupid thing to say ! I guess there was this feeling that marriage was a necessary evil . Having inherited her parents ' notion that marriage for anyone is a necessary evil , Kathy not only had a negative marriage paradigm , but she also feared that she was so replete with defects that no one would ever want her for a spouse : " I think that the thought that anybody would love me and marry me was such a high expectation for me that it did n't come down to reality at all . I wanted it , but I did n't think I was marriage material . " When Lyle came along , there was a brief period of fun and romance , succeeded all too quickly  | by letdown , periodic break-ups , conflict , and extreme moodiness on Lyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would feel responsible for his moods , try to lift him out of them , and then feel guilty for failing to do so . Then Kathy became pregnant . Again she felt her own basic defectiveness was at work . " I felt ashamed of being pregnant , with people that I worked with . I felt everybody would say , Oh , that 's the only way she could get a husband . ' I did not want to get married . I did n't want anything to do with it . But I could n't see any other way out of this dilemma . " Her ensuing marriage began on the same note of conflict and despair that marked her courtship , a seeming vindication of her parents ' sense that love is an affliction and marriage a necessary evil : I did n't think it would be good , but I did n't think it would be as bad as it was . I was much more unhappy than I expected . We had a yard , and I would sit out in the yard and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with my situation . I was completely bewildered , and I felt that I had weights on my mouth , pulling my mouth down . I guess no matter how unpleasant our courtship had been , I still was n't prepared for the reality of the unpleasantness of the marriage . Notice Kathy 's sense of passivity and powerlessness in this account , for here is a clue to the Hedged Bet nature of her agenda for marriage . Unlike some other respondents , she did not have an external hedge like a horse , or a notion of needing to preserve her individual freedom and third-corner independence to do this or that after marriage . But she did retain her own sense of unworthiness and defectiveness , and she married under circumstances that left perfectly intact her earlier doubts about being able to sustain a marriage . Kathy 's hedge , then , was a totally internal one . She stood more ready to bet on her inadequacy than on her marriage-ability . Even as she entered marriage , she had already gone a long way toward emotionally distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters became still worse than she feared , she could only cast herself as a spectator to her own misfortune , fall into bewilderment , and feel powerless to effect any significant changes . It might be said that everyone hedges their bet on marriage to some extent , that most of the marriage agendas portrayed earlier have at least some flavor of diverting a share of the burden of emotional security from the lap of just one person in order to redistribute it somewhere safer . But there is a difference . Hedged Bet carries with it a fundamental sense of the problematic and troublesome nature of marriage . There may indeed be an element of evasive maneuvers vis-a-vis one 's spouse in the other agendas too . Those who invest heavily in children , or career , or extended family , or religion , or the consumer society may do so with something of a defensive posture , and when this posture cones to dominate , their investment then too becomes a hedged  | bet against marriage . But the fact remains that these investments in career or children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying vision of marriage that is positive , optimistic , and sanguine . In contrast , Hedged Betters are pessimistic about marriage and resigned to its frailty . Hence their need for protection from it is basic , and they require some central , arm's-length strategy to lessen their vulnerability . Open Agendas Are there people who carry no images of what marriage should be ? Is it possible to bring an agenda-free standpoint to marriage ? Surely this prospect is most difficult . Not only does everyone dwell in a culture , thus absorbing the - popular knowledge about marriage , but everyone also has a personal history that is laden with vivid imagery about marriage , derived from direct , face-toface illustrations of married life , particularly as provided by our parents . Given all this imagery it would be strange indeed to find people who have remained unmoved by it all , who can truly put aside everything they know about marriage and venture into it with a totally open mind . Nevertheless , some people are relatively agenda-free . They too have some agendas ; they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain needs . But their agendas do not grip their vision of marriage with the same tenacious hold that we find among other people . The crux of the matter is that marriage agendas may become hardened or softened in our awareness . Their texture may be rigid and unyielding , or flexible , bending , and malleable . In the latter instance , we can speak of Open Agendas ? agendas that are flexible enough to be transformed , or even yielding enough to be abandoned . Those people who already have Open Agendas by the time they marry almost always come from homes that were emotionally comfortable . They recall secure and happy childhoods , and they see their parents as having had excellent marriages together . As adults , they now think of their parents , if they are still living , as friends . The reservoir of good feeling between them leads to enthusiastic visiting and a continuing congenial relationship . These people do not have many lingering " deficiency needs " ; they have a strong history of feeling safe and secure , loved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , they come to marriage with an extremely positive , optimistic outlook . They look forward to the companionship and the sense of belonging that can accompany marriage , but they have no pressing need to prefigure much about it . In the words of one such woman , " I was prepared to go more than half way to keep things on an even keel . " People with Open Agendas can most readily leave behind the marital paradigm% modeled by their parents . They do not necessarily need to do so ,  | and indeed , they often embrace or at least fall into that paradigm precisely because it seems so easy , comfortable , and desirable . Nevertheless , education or a particular line of self-development may lead such a person into a very different life-style than his or her parents had , and that life-style may require considerable marital changes , relative to what the parents did . Then too , people may often need to transform their parents ' marital paradigm just because their partner 's needs and interests make it impossible to comfortably maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of marital dynamics , people with Open Agendas can more readily bend and adapt to the new directions carved out by their partners . They can even encourage their partners to move into these new territories , and prod them into taking a few risks , sometimes at the cost of some considerable discomfort to themselves . Moreover , they can persevere much longer than most people could with an intractable partner who puts severe tension on the marriage , and they can typically do so without accumulating a lot of unexpressed resentments . A young professional , married thirteen years , quickly discovered that his wife often lacked the easygoing temperament that he was used to in his parents : Louise is probably not as stable a person as I would have expected myself to marry , in the sense that she can get very upset about something really quickly . It became a tension in terms of adjusting to her being upset over a long period of time about things like the kids ' education and the particular problems the kids have had in their classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then calm down a couple of days after the fact . Experience just taught me that there was no point in trying to discuss it until she calmed down and kept the whole thing in perspective . If I 'm upset about something I always ask myself , " Is this an important issue ? Is it going to matter next week ? A month from now ? Well , certainly it wo n't . Then why get upset about it ? " Most things are not worth getting upset about . But she gets upset first and only later realizes it is n't the most important thing . Sometimes I get tired of having to say to myself , " Let 's wait till she cools down . " Like this fall , she would carry on from the time I got home until eight or nine o'clock about something the principal did . There 's no profit in letting yourself stay worked up for three or four hours about something that is beyond your control . This man clearly does not like this tendency that his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its target . Yet , true to his own philosophy , he tends to minimize the importance of anything unseemly and he focusses on the positive . The only thing that I can think of that 's been an aggravation is that tendency of hers to blow up . It 's been a source of ? well , " disappointment " is a little strong ? perhaps " unease " fundamentally positive outlook and their considerable fund of good feelings about marriage , people with Open Agendas do not buckle under in times of stress . They can wait it out , even rise to the occasion , and use adversity as an opportunity for greater self-development and self-discovery . A minister , who saw his parents ' marriage as positive and his own home life as good and comfortable , married a woman whose family history had left her with a lot of insecurities . He told me , " Carol had to deal with having been made to feel inferior by her mother and father , and she still struggles with this feeling a bit . Her coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important person ? that 's been great to watch . " But this man perhaps understates not only his own contribution to his wife 's process but also his accomplishment in coaxing the most he could out of a difficult situation . Here is Carol 's account : When our daughter was about three , I had a depression-type nervous breakdown ? not bad enough to be in the hospital , but I was on medication , and I 'd have moments of complete panic and depression . A lot of it was caused by my mother 's hold on me . She used to say things like , " If you do n't do thus and such , your father will drink more and it will be your fault . " This was always held over my head . When I left home I felt like I was deserting her and a sinking ship . But I did n't realize this until it suddenly came out , and then it took me about five or six years to really snap out of it . It was a very difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure . I think if it had n't been for Mark it would have been far worse than it was . He really stood by me , and I 'm sure it was n't easy for him . And it took a long time . I 've heard him say that it 's been a good experience for him because it helped him , in his work , to understand the things people go through , having witnessed it in his own family . Looking back on it some twenty years later , it was a growing thing for both of us . I think it was good that it happened . People with Open Agendas are also best equipped to fill in whatever gaps are left by their partner , in terms of the whole array of tasks associated with making a life and family together . They can more readily interchange roles and take over the tasks left undone , should the occasion call upon them to do so . This occurred when a female respondent brought suit against a potential employer for denying her a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reprecussions of that court battle on their marriage : I really did have to face the question , " Are you all mouth , or are you ever going to do what you say you do ? " What I did was to take over what I had been doing part-time . It started originally with lunches in Ohio . I was home writing my dissertation and she was working in a nursery school , so I began to do the lunch so that she could come home to a good meal . It 's a relatively easy thing to extend that to another meal if you 're there at home . And it just grew that way . I do n't remember any real negotiation about it . . . . When the  | four of us were home all the time , I probably devoted three to four hours a day to it . I get up first , I do breakfast , start the fire , and do all that stuff . I 'd go home and prepare the noontime meal , usually did most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to write a cookbook someday on nineteenth century food . I 'm hopeful that that will be a joint publication . I 've always thought that she 'd be a very good scholar . She 's a methodical , dedicated , creative researcher . Notice how this man not only took over the traditionally female role of cooking and dishwashing , but did so with a keen , creative flair that could culminate in a new venture together as a couple . Compare his account to that of another man who exclaimed , " We were brought up in an era when the man went out and earned a living and the wife took care of the house , and it stayed that way . I would n't under any circumstances have anything to do with keeping house , for instance . She 's far superior in that field . " Here we see the difference between an open marriage agenda and a closed one . People with Open Agendas can most readily blur the traditional distinctions between male and female . They are more androgynous , to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid to show their strength and selfassertion , and the men need not hide any tendencies toward gentleness , timidity , and vulnerability . A woman spoke of some areas in which she willingly fills in for her shy husband : I realize some things are very difficult for him to do , so I take over and help him . He 's not a weak man ; he 's just very shy , because of the way he was raised . My parents always made me feel I was the greatest . They always praised me , whereas he could never seem to please his parents . He 's so shy about some things . I 've mothered him , and I think he needed that badly . And I 've taken over some things like calling the plumber , and giving someone the dickens . And I 've done most of the disciplining of the kids . But when it came right down to push , he 'll take over . He probably felt I was doing a good enough job . And lots of times he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get too angry . I do think I 've given him more confidence in himself . But I 've also taken responsibilities which , if I were a weaker person , he 'd have shouldered . Notice how she herself sees the connection between coming from a secure home in which esteem was amply given , and developing the strength and flexibility to rise to any occasion , even if that means doing some of the things which , in her world , men typically do . Of course , insecure homes , or homes with parents who were quite stingy in handing out praise and approval , do not necessarily produce children who remain forever inflexible , unyielding , and fixed in their vision of what a marriage must be . As we shall see , the transformations that some marriages undergo can dramatically reverse the tide of tendencies flowing from one 's earlier  | family history . People who bring rather closed agendas to their marriages may find it possible , desirable , or perhaps just necessary to open them up later . It depends , first , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents , and then on the dynamics triggered by the particular collision of paradigms and agendas that any marriage involves . Some general remarks are now in order . First , the fit between the different agenda types presented here and any actual marriage should be understood as a loose one . These agendas are not meant to exhaustively describe any marriage . An agenda is merely a single cluster of intentions , and no such cluster can embrace the full wealth of desires and intentions or the fears that anyone seeks their marriage to address . There could be no pure cases of any of these agenda types , no one whose only purpose in marriage is to rear children , or to avoid some demon , or to turn marriage into an Economic Calling , a Safe Return Home , a Religious Calling , a Safe Haven or a Hedged Bet . Anyone 's design for marriage is a composite of myriad purposes , and even those respondents who were selected to illustrate a particular agenda often have many of the strivings that make up the other agendas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid , hedge their bets on marriage in at least some minor way , and want their marriages to be Safe Havens . The very concept of marriage is often metaphoric ; it may represent our grandest hopes and our fondest ambitions , even our most vague and indefinite yearnings , so it is hardly surprising that no single model or type of marriage could exhaust the totality of anyone 's imagery about it . That said , the fact remains that marriage agendas do point to real phenomena because images and intentions are perfectly real . People act on them , see their partners in terms of them , and often seek to maneuver their partners into more closely approximating them . Marriage agendas , then , are real tendencies and not just fictional abstractions or distorted caricatures . Before leaving part I and the subject of marital statics , it is worth casting a summary glance at its thrust , as part II will build on it . We have been surveying some of the images that people bring to their marriages as well as some agendas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the diversity of images in terms of all three corners of marriage ( the inner-corner , the partnership-corner and the variety of third-corners ) , I want to make it clear that these images can only accumulate , get stored in , and to a large extent constitute the inner-corner alone , and they do so long before a marriage or even a courtship is formed . The inner-corner should be understood as the master organizer , the supervisor , and director of our marital projects , the unseen choreographer of our partnership dance . The partnership- and third-corners do not themselves organize or direct anything ; they are outward manifestations of the inner drama . Since the human self can not contain itself , it spills outward , seeking and creating the second- and third-corner channels for its  | further expansion and development . As it does so , the inner self is guided by all the paradigmatic images that linger on as the traces of earlier experience . This is the process that we have been noting in part I , as we watch courtships and marriages begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner-corner is filled with all the noise and clutter from the past . We can neither avoid having that clutter nor do anything to erase it ; it is there , impressed and imprinted in the vault of our permanent record . Experience may be a good teacher , but it keeps on collecting trinkets which take up room . Even positive , joyful experience is clutter in this sense ; it leaves an imprint , which then profiles our future expectations and inhibits us from remaining open to all possibilities . What we can do , given the futility of attempting to erase the clutter , is learn how to live with it , as we develop the eyes to save us from blindly stumbling into it and the legs to move around it . Marriage sometimes coaxes us to gain this facility , but it can just as easily fail to do so in either of two ways . On one hand , we have seen throughout part I how tempting it is for people to create the very circumstances of partnership that will lead them to bump into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , some of the marriage agendas that people create in their eagerness to avoid their inner clutter are no less confining . It is as if the old clutter in the room appears so formidable that we cordon off a tiny little section to move around in , ignoring the fact that we are usually bringing new clutter into this section , and forgetting that there is far more spaciousness to be found in using the entire room if we could only learn to navigate amidst the old clutter . In partnership lies the chance to learn some new navigations . Just because marriage brings two cluttered rooms together ( to put it rather unkindly ) , creative forces can be freed . Even if I want to recreate my familiar clutter in my marriage , my partner may feel too confined within the limited territory I have mapped out , resist it , and once more exhort me to move around in whatever wider space I have access to . Needless to say , both the old and new clutter that my partner brings to the marriage may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits to marital statics given by the reality of partnership . Marital dynamics can break through the inertia of statics as soon as two personal histories come out of their respective encapsulation and stand revealed to each other . Notes 1 .

Both Lila Balch and Bob Milardo have reminded me in personal communications that once children do leave , some couples with a For the Children agenda may be able to refocus their relationship around the grandparent role .  | Introduction to Marital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about marriage , how these images typically arise before partners ever meet , and how they attain some measure of inertia . Once people do meet and marry , the inertia of these images may sometimes persist unchanged for many years , and it could then appear that the field of statics is sufficient to explain what has been going on . I did interview a number of persons who claimed that nothing essentially new , surprising , or unpredictable had ever transpired in their marriage , neither in the early period nor at any time later on . They claimed , further , that they could not identify any differences in themselves or their partner as a result of living together , not a single new insight , discovery , or understanding about each other , as if their marriage were nothing more than a series of external events that have come and gone without seriously affecting what they know and feel about one another . These are relationships that are described as if they have no internal history , no development , and no dynamics , everything essential about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . It certainly appears , in these cases , that the inertia of early images can sometimes rule the day indefinitely and filter out any significant change before it can make its impact . Nevertheless , some continual surveillance , some work of screening out is still required for one partner to resist any serious impact of the other , or to keep protected from the vulnerabilities of change . Insofar as this active maintenance effort is necessary to keep the early inertia rolling as it is , statics alone can not explain each new change-resisting surge of activity that appears . We thus need a theory of marital dynamics to account for the forces of both maintenance and change in a relationship . Any individual 's images and agendas for marriage are not immovable objects , however doggedly persistent they may be . Our partners may offer up some considerable resistance , thereby making it difficult to frictionlessly enter our paradigms and agendas into our marriages . With marital dynamics , we turn to the forces and counterforces created when two people , with two separate life histories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term relationship . Here are some early recollections of a woman who has been married for fifteen years : Living with a person is totally different form dating a person . When we got married I realized that you have to make adjustments . I saw my mother in her pajamas but not my father ; he was always dressed . Clyde did n't wear pajamas ; that was sort of a rude shock . I went , " Oh , where are your pajamas ? " and he said , " I do n't wear pajamas , " and I went , " Oh , God ! " I can remember my reaction to it . I was so embarrassed . I bought him a bathrobe , thinking that would be kind of a subtle hint . He hated it ; he never wore it . He does n't walk around the house naked , but in the bedroom he just gets undressed . Or if he 's in the bathroom taking a shower , he 's not embarrassed if I walk in there . He just does n't ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove me nuts too . He ate differently than anyone I ever saw . He could eat a chicken wing , leg , or breast with a knife and fork and never pick the thing up with his fingers . In my house we used to love to pick up the bones and suck on them . With Clyde , I never dared , for the first two or three months , to say , " Do you mind if I pick up this pork chop bone ? " I mean , it was driving me nuts . I got out a book of etiquette and it said chicken could be eaten with the fingers , so I showed it to him . I was afraid he 'd think I was really gross . Here we see two very different paradigms coming together ? two different products of family history having a minor collision early in a marriage . The collision did not prove to be serious ; it touched neither partner at the deeper core of their images and agendas for marriage . The fact is that in any intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least images of the countless details of everyday living meet face-to-face . Every such partnership is therefore laden with dynamics , some hidden and some of them out in the open . Here I shall deal only with those aspects of connection that have seemed to matter the most to my respondents . Essentially , the meeting of two people 's life histories can take three different forms . In paradigm conflict there is a head-on collision of some key needs , images , or agendas . His and her life-experiences inspire respective visions that in some way contravene each other . In paradigm consensus both partners are in spontaneous agreement about certain core images and expectations . Two life-paths converge together rather than collide . And in paradigm complementation each partner 's deepest inclinations are different from the other 's ; yet , in the absence of expressed or felt opposition , the fulfillment of one partner 's leanings is compatible with the fulfillment of the other 's . Two life-paths diverge without serious conflict . Paradigm Conflict and Paradigm Consensus Since every person 's marital paradigm contains innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some paradigm conflict , some consensus ,  | and some complementation ? that is , some collisions , some convergences , and some divergences . The balance between these three forces will be crucial in determining just how satisfying or unsatisfying a particular marriage may feel . I find that marriages can easily survive powerful paradigm conflicts , provided that there is also some key paradigm consensus to lend a measure of positive feeling and shared vision of what it means to make a life together . In a culture of patriarchy the most trying paradigm conflicts in the early period of a marriage often focus on how much a husband should be home , what time he should return from his job or other outside third-corner , and what the rules are for checking in with his wife if he is away for more than a few minutes . Needless to say , as women effectively challenge the culture of patriarchy , the focus of these conflicts often shifts to the wife 's third-corner comings and goings , as it is no longer assumed that her place is to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need or want it . Since virtually all of the men and women in my data inherited patriarchal paradigms , it usually took at least several years of marriage for any concerted challenges of this paradigm to be made . Most of the wives have never been inclined to make such challenges , and thus paradigm conflicts with their husbands take place within the overall patriarchal framework : she focusses on her partnership-corner and clamors for more of his attention ; he focusses on his third-corners and clamors for more independence . Becky Gorman , married fourteen years , recalls how difficult it was to adjust to her husband 's work hours : One time I had expected Morris home at a certain time . I knew he was painting a car in his father 's auto-body shop , and he told me he would be home for supper , and I waited and waited and waited . Of course the frustration kept building up . When he finally got home I said , " Do n't talk to me ! " But that did n't last long . I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being newly married and being alone ? I had never been alone ! There were always people around where I was . And it was hard to adjust to , it really was . That 's the one big thing that I remember . It did n't bother me so much being alone during the day , but the nighttime loneliness was really hard . After a few months Morris got a sales job , and they moved to a new town several hours away from their familiar setting . Becky told me , " I was used to someone getting up at a certain time and being home at a certain time . When Morris started selling , that was when the real test for me came because he was gone evenings , and I had never been left alone . " Two years and two children later , Becky was still struggling with these same issues . Now I had two children to work with , and Morris was still out selling , and there was still the loneliness that I was trying to adjust to . Lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a particular time , and two or three hours later ,  | he would come home . I understand that now . If he 's three or four hours late , I do n't worry and I do n't get myself all upset , because I understand that 's part of his selling . Morris recalled the same car-painting episode that Becky had remembered from fourteen years back : I was painting a Cadillac and I did n't like the way it came out , so I repainted it . I did n't feel like cleaning off my hands to call my wife and tell her I 'd be late . I was three or four hours late , and when I got home my wife was all upset and crying . I got cleaned up and went ahead and made the beef stew she was going to make , and she got over it . Morris also provided some additional background information that clearly reveals the paradigm conflict lurking behind the Gormans ' early issues : At home , if I was doing some body work and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing , and that 's all there was to it . I was used to that , and my wife is n't . If my father was n't there for supper , my mother went ahead and had supper . Right now , Becky 's father works in a lumber yard , and if the roof was falling off the building he 'd still leave work at 4:30 . I 'm not built that way . I go home when the work is done . But her father is home at a quarter of five , and her mother is pacing the floor if he 's five minutes late . Well , my wife was that way when we first got married , and she 's gotten over that now . Last night I got home at 9:15 . Now that was early ; I sometimes do n't get home till midnight . My wife does n't even plan on me having supper unless I tell her that I will be home for supper . Despite the Gormans ' early paradigm conflict about a husband 's schedule and his accessibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , revolving around a shared agenda to make their marriage a Religious Calling . Becky told me , " After I joined the church my main goal was to marry within the church . " Morris , in fact , was one of the few eligible young males in her area who met this requirement . Once married , Becky and Morris were both inclined to see any emotional frustrations as undeserving of much emphasis . As Becky put it : Our church teaches us that we can become perfect if we follow the Savior 's example , and this is what Morris and I are trying to do . Without the marriage we ca n't obtain the perfection that we want . And we hope by giving our children the proper training that they too will feel and believe the same way that we do and that it will be a continuing process through the generations . Morris put it even more strongly : My goal was not to get married to be married , but for eternal companionship . If you both believe in the teachings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason why you should n't have a successful marriage . We have that transcendental goal , and we have more of a common yoke . Through the Gorman 's religious third-corner consensus , potentially grievou paradigm conflicts thus get shelved , neutralized , or simply discarded . Agenda Clashes Even aggravated agenda clashes may be neutralized by some counterbalanc ing paradigm consensus . An agenda clash is any conflict in which the part ners ' willful marriage intentions , based on their respective paradigms , directh contradict each other . Agenda clashes are particularly explosive because the are fueled by a keenly explicit awareness of what should and should not b ( occurring in a marriage . When expectations go unmet under these condi tions , both partners may feel cheated and betrayed by their marriage , ead determined to induce the other to change his or her ways . These agenda-clashing dynamics were dramatically illustrated by Mikf and Jill McCarthy , married twelve years . Their responses to their familial paradigms set them on an early collision course with each other . For Mike the one thing he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vet ( power over his father 's activities . I think my mother is more the ruler than my father . Sometimes I did n't particularly care for that . Like if I wanted to take him to a ball game she would put up a stink , and of course my father would say , " All right , I just wo n't go . " I feel that this wo n't happen with me . You felt the man should be the head of the household ? Oh yes , definitely . If I 'm going to make a decision , I want her to go along with it . On Jill 's side , there was ample training for that compliance which Mikc sought in a wife . Jill 's mother married a man who was her senior by more than twenty years , and his life-style kept him largely inaccessible both to het and to their family . Despite that , Jill 's mother remained dependent and uncomplaining . My mother holds a lot of her feelings inside . She 's always appreciated my father bringing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Even though we never had a lot of money and expensive things , that did n't mean anything to Momma as long as she was taken care of and we were taken care of . She was passive that way . She was n't a demanding person .
