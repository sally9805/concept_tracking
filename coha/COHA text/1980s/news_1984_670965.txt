But public officials in the South are trying to come to grips with another alarming truth : Despite the appearance of plenty , farmers , towns and industries are slowly but surely depleting the supply of cheap , clean underground water that underlies large areas of the region and has historically provided the water for anything from drinking to crop irrigation. // <> <> Once Seen as a Nuisance // // " Up until now , people in Mississippi and many parts of the Southeast have thought of water as mostly a nuisance , " said Prof. Marvin T. Bond , who heads the Water Resource Research Institute at Mississippi State University . " They said , just keep the floods away from my back door. // " But with the demands on those resources increasing , " Professor Bond added , " we are having to convince people that , amid all that plenty , we are facing what could be a real crisis in long-term water supply . " This summer Arkansas , Louisiana and Mississippi , each bordering the Mississippi River , are studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quanity and quality of a resource that until recently was perceived as limitless. // Among other things , Southeastern states are examining ways to supplement declining supplies of water from the ground by making greater use , wherever possible , of the large volumes of surface water that now pass untouched through the region ' s rivers and streams , on its way to the sea. // That is already happening in Mississippi , a state that relies on ground water more than any other in the eastern United States . Near Tupelo , in northeastern Mississippi , falling water tables have forced the city to abandon some wells over the last decade and to look for financing to build a $26 million plant to treat water piped in from the Tombigbee River , 14 miles to the east . <> <> It ' s Going to Cost Money // // " We are not a water-short state , " said Charles T. Branch , the director of Mississippi ' s Bureau of Land and Water Resources . " In fact , we have a surplus , like most other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we need it is going to cost money. " // Mr. Branch and others say that in order to make use of a larger share of the surface water , the state is going to have to come up with the capital to finance reservoirs and treatment plants and pipelines at a time when the Reagan Administration has cut back on Federal aid for such expensive public works . As a result , he said , consumers and farmers are going to have to foot the bill by paying more for their water. // " The problem is related to the South and Sun Belt , " says Prof. James Kundell , a water management expert at the University of Georgia . " Not only have increasing growth and industrialization put more of a strain on the resource , but so has the increased use of irrigation in parts of Florida , in southwest Georgia , Mississippi and Arkansas . " <> <> Salt Water Intrusion // // Professor Kundell said that overdrafting of ground water , which some describe as water mining , will not only dry up wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow salt water to intrude and contaminate the water supply . He also said it had caused the ground to subside in some areas , a phenomenon that has had its most dramatic effect in Florida , where sinkholes have swallowed entire houses. // Georgia and Florida , which rely on ground water for much of their needs , were among the first states in the region to put water management plans into effect . In Florida , for example , permits that limit withdrawals have been required for several years. // In Georgia , permits have been also required since 1982 , although the regulations exclude wells drilled for agricultural use . " This is a major drawback , " said Professor Kundell , who is an adviser on water policy to the Georgia Legislature . " Since 1972 , the number of acres of cropland under irrigation in Georgia has increased from less than 100 , 000 to more than a million . " <> <> Studies in 3 States // // In Arkansas , public hearings will begin this fall on proposed legislation that would allow state officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farming interests helped defeat legislation that would have required farmers to obtain permits regulating the use of ground water. // " We ' ve got a situation where more and more crops are being irrigated by less and less water , " said John P. Saxton , the director of the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission . " I think the farmers and well drillers see that unless we regulate ground water now , it ' s going to cost them more in the long run. " // A panel of Mississippi experts , the Water Management Council , is studying measures to better regulate ground water , which is being withdrawn at a rate faster than it can be restored . The council is expected to recommend a new water policy to the Legislature next year. // In Louisiana , the Legislature this year will begin to study a 438-page report by a state study commission that , among other things , recommends that lawmakers recast water law in anticipation of growing competition for the state ' s surface and ground water resources . <> <> Concern Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being discussed in the Southeast , a region that receives more rainfall that any other part of the nation , underscores the perception of some public officials and conservationists that water is the single most important resource issue of the decade. // In the past , much of the concern over water development has focused on the arid states west of the 100th meridian , where rainfall is barely a quarter of what it is in Mississippi . In the West , where water has the political and emotional viscosity of blood , disputes over water rights frequently were resolved by the gun. // In states like Mississippi and Arkansas , astride a river with a daily flow many times in excess of the water needs of both states , there has until now been little dispute over water because there was always enough to go around . In fact , there is almost no case history of water law in the region , disputes have been so rare. // Experts like Mr. Branch of Mississippi say the water situation has changed because of population growth , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irrigation // // In the Delta of northwestern Mississippi , for example , a sharp increase in irrigated cropland , coupled with the expansion of activities that use a lot of water , like rice growing and catfish farming , have raised doubts among some geologists whether the aquifer that underlies the area will be adequate into the next century. // According to Mr. Branch , the amount of land being used for rice cultivation in Mississippi has doubled since 1979 , to nearly 350 , 000 acres . And acreage in ponds for raising catfish has also doubled since 1980 , to more than 70 , 000 acres. // Some of the worst problems have been near Tupelo , where well drillers began to notice a drop in water tables some 30 years ago . The rate of decline accelerated through the 1970 ' s , dropping an average of six feet a year. // The problem resulted not from agricultural but from municipal and industrial use in the town of 24 , 000 people , said Larry Otis , who heads the Tombigbee River Valley Water Management District . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area around Tupelo would face a shortage of ground water by the year 2000 if present rates of usage continued. // As a result , Mr. Otis said , local officials are starting to raise money for a $26 million project to treat water from the nearby Tombigbee River and pipe it to the city . " Tupelo , " he said , " is at least two years ahead of the rest of the state in dealing with this problem. " // //
