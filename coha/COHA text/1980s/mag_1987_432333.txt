 | The scene is a private club called Pasha in Dallas . A black Rolls coasts up to the beige awning . A valet swings the door open and silently extends a smooth palm for the keys . He is young and handsome . Inside , couples file past a pair of huge elephant tusks and take up positions at a stand-up bar . They are young and handsome . Across the parquet dance floor a man , three sheets to the wind and wearing an expensive-looking dinner jacket , crawls onto an animal-skin sofa . In the back corner and up two steps , women in sequined evening dresses are gathered around small tables , exchanging gossip and sipping champagne . They are all young and handsome . Strains of smoky jazz filter into the warm night air . It 's hard to believe it 's the spring of 1987 .. . New York last week was the scene of an even eerier example of dejcc uu . An exact replica of the old El Morocco , that posh and very privileged supper club once favored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location for its old habitues . The room where Humphrey Bogart once belted a woman in a dispute over a toy panda was awash with nostalgia , as the ever-tan George Hamilton fondly tested the refurbished zebra-stripe banquettes . New owner Usha Singh , a wealthy Indian socialite , saw to it that the walls were splashed in the original electric blue , and the premises were studded with copies of those once familiar phony white palm trees . Except for the nagging feeling of faded glory , it could have been the old " Elmo 's " of 40 years ago . " This was my first nightclub , " sighed Hamilton , who escorted his mother , Anne . " I first came here when I was 12 . " Discos are passe . Even Manhattan 's infamous Area joined Studio 54 in nightclub heaven last month . More than anything else , clubs and restaurants these days seem to want to belong to another era ? the late ' 30 's and ' 40s , when the atmosphere was sweetly genteel and society bands played Cole Porter tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hoarse patrons of high-tech discos were actually Young Fogies ? the English term for the new frumpy , conservative set ? yearning for the upscale serenity of a comfortably cluttered drawing room or gentleman 's supper club with deep leather chairs and a knowing maitre d ' . Young Fogies are in search of intimacy . In better times , when everyone who was anyone had a good address , they would have held private parties chez nous . But now they 're going to small , dimly lit places and landmark restaurants that look like living rooms used to . These clubs have turned down the stereo and cranked up the class , exchanging cinder blocks and strip lights for mahogany paneling and low chandeliers , benches and plastic cups for skirted chairs and fluted glasses . " These people want their status ensured and enhanced , " says Rudolf , manager of the Basement lounge of the Tunnel club in Manhattan . " In other days we would do something wild , but wild would not be well received now , " he says , surveying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion and furnishings is straight out of " A Room With a View " ? everything looks elegant and antique . They are fond of the grand chic , sporting pricey revivals of classic styles from Grace Kelly sweater sets and taffeta skirts to scarlet-lined Burberrys and black tie . Here , within a charmed and charming inner circle , the girls with pearls and the guys with yellow ties practice their social skills . Part hostess , part vamp : As club owners have discovered , Young Fogies will happily pay extra for the privilege of rubbing shoulders with their own kind . Pasha , a private club , already has more than 650 of Dallas 's beautiful people signed up , at $1,000 for men and $400 for women . " When it gets crowded here , you 're going to have your elbow jostled , " says Pasha manager Jasper Russo . " But at least it wo n't be by someone you 're offended by . " Gazing around Pasha 's rose-colored room , one lawyer in his mid-40s  | summed up the club 's attraction another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dallas . You can tell , " says Richard Corbitt , " by the way they dress , the way they act . " No place is more Fogyish than Nell 's , New York City 's hottest new nightclub . With its romantic lighting and secondhand sofas , velvet drapes and gilded mirrors , Nell 's is the perfect place for languid posing and striking attitudes . " We wanted it to seem as though it 's always been here and all we had to do was dust away the cobwebs , " says Nell Campbell , a 33-year-old veteran of the " The Rocky Horror Picture Show " and the club 's inspiration and namesake . Part hostess , part vamp , Nell is a vision in bobbed red hair and a skinny tube dress that ends just before her black garters begin . " It 's like being in someone 's sitting room ; you can really behave badly among all this , " she says , adding , " We 're most keen on promoting sex and conversation . " One delighted customer , student David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , only you do n't know who the host is . " Civilized approach : Almost from opening night in February of 1986 , Nell 's endeared itself to Young Fogies for its Old World air of exclusivity . Unlike other clubs , it does n't have theme parties ? no Power Tuesdays for the Wall Street crowd , or Gay Nights on Sunday . While technically open to the public , Nell 's has 300 members and is selling 10 to 20 more memberships each week at $200 a pop . Not just any movie star can waltz past the velvet ropes and pay the $5 cover charge : Nell 's bouncers have reportedly rejected the likes of Warren Beatty , Don Johnson and Cher in favor of less recognizable celebs , such as English theater actor Ian McKellen , author Norman Mailer and dancers from the New York City Ballet . " We 're not pretentious , " protests co-owner Keith McKnally . " We just have to be very strict . Not everyone can go to Nell 's , or to Harvard , or to heaven for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cozy spots a welcome relief from noisy , crowded discos . " People are a little bit scared of the way the world is now , " says Reto Cantone , owner of the New York eatery Caffe Roma . " They do n't want to be subjected to masses of people they do n't know ? it 's all more formal , people want small clubs with a certain crowd . " Next month Cantone plans to open his own European-style salon . " After a meal , " he says , " they can go downstairs for drinks and soft music , play cards or even read . " Chances are few of Cantone 's customers will bring a book . The new , civilized approach applies strictly to the setting ? not the singles scene . " This is a meat market too , " says Pasha 's Russo . It 's just done with a little more taste . 68 NEWSWEEK : MAY 11 , 1987
