The night that Dutch DeHoke .1 came to the Renn house , Aunt Jennie filled a wooden tub with warm water and gave Dutch a bath . The unfamiliarity of the whole business  --  mellow lamplight , ministering hands , a smell of bacon and ginger cake in the room instead of nauseating odors , the shock of his father 's mutilation and death  --  all these factors must have confused the quivering 13-year-old mind of Dutch DeHoke and tortured him in ways he could not express . He had been tortured before . I remember how we used to drive past the DeHoke place and shudder . My father would shake his head ; we children would stare at the stark , gray house behind its windbreak of broken willows ; we would see dark figures moving against the dirty straw near the barn doors . They were grim figures , DeHoke figures , pitiful and frightening by turns . We heard what old Carl DeHoke had done to his wife and how she had died of it . . . But at last the devil came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The devil came on a day when old DeHoke went out to disk the plowed land behind the windbreak , and perhaps he beat his horses once too often . Peter , the boy  --  we called him Dutch  --  found his father 's body . It was not a nice thing to see , after the cleaving weight of the disk had passed over it . . . . So Mr. and Mrs. Renn took Dutch in . Mr. and Mrs. Billy Renn were always taking boys in . They lived on a little farm southeast of the DeHoke place  --  a farm lying along the hills beside Nathan 's River . Long ago , Aunt Jennie and Uncle Billy Renn had two boys of their own , and among the tragedies of our early county history was the tale of the prairie fire which burned the Rennhouse and the two boys in it . William Renn did n't rebuild among the ashes of his home . Instead he built a little house at the far corner of his land , with the river valley close outside the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was big enough for the Renns and their memories . Within a few years it began to be big enough for the boys they brought there . Sometimes there was only one boy , sometimes there were two or three . Dutch DeHoke was the last to come . There was something peculiar and distinctive about the grasses growing outside the Renn 's yard fence . They were wild prairie grasses ; they had always grown there , and by the time I came along there was little of such unturned prairie sod in Fairweather Township . It would n't have made good land for cultivation ; still , I think it was Aunt Jennie 's affection rather than a farmer 's wisdom which kept Uncle Billy from putting a plow to the virgin soil . There , in earliest spring , the windflowers romped and rolled . People will tell you that windflowers have no smell , and yet their smell is in my nostrils now . It has musk and dust in it , like the scent of dandelions when you crush them . And botanists will tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and they will roll out a name like Pulsatilla ludoviciana . But Aunt Jennie was no botanist . She called them " Easter flowers " because sometimes they came at Easter season if the mysteries of the religious calendar permitted . The blossoms ran through every shade of lavender , lilac and purple , back again to pinkish white . Their centers caught the sun and held it ; the hairs of stems and petals were silky as hairs on a baby 's skin . They came before the first wake-robins lifted white among rotting leavesnear the river . . . Something wonderful happened when wind-flowers blew upon those hills . Dutch DeHoke was no silk-feathered flower , blooming in his benefactors ' dooryard . The anguish of his previous years had toughened him . He was never the fair-haired little Hollander of wooden-shoe legend . He was dark , almost swarthy . A fight , to Dutch , was not a rowdy encounter to be entered upon carelessly or easily , and to be forgotten with the first distraction . When he did fight , he was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teeth , fists , feet , a broken singletree , a hoe or whatever came handy . Once he and the Callahan boys got in an argument , and when Dutch decided that his right to life and happiness was endangered , he opened his pocketknife and slashed Marty Callahan 's forearm . Old man Callahan told Aunt Jennie that unless she could keep her orphan under control , he 'd see that Dutch was sent to an institution . He made Uncle Billy take Dutch 's knife away from him ; poor Uncle Billy had to whip Dutch , out behind the corncrib , and then take him into the house for Aunt Jennie to read the Bible to him . " Ca n't I read The Book instead ? " he asked repeatedly , and at last she relented . An itinerant salesman had cajoled Aunt Jennie into paying six dollars for an illustrated volume : The Encyclopedic Atlas of Mankind 's Endeavors and Accomplishments , Complete with Maps and Lavish Illustrations . To Dutch , fresh from a home where the only printed matter consisted of catalogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum of all to which he might ever hope or attain . Gradually one section came to be more thumbed and dog-eared than the rest . That section dealt with mankind 's accomplishments in the bowels of the earth . It had some queer little pictures of cars running on tracks and laborers with lamps in their caps . It showed the salt mines of Siberia , and Dutch liked the chapter " Down in a Coal Mine " better than the one I always fancied , " Down in a Diving Bell . " Gold was his specialty  --  perhaps because the lack of it was such a horrid factor in his earliest life and was even of considerable inconvenience to the Renns . Proceeding in the face of repeated warnings , he carried gold-hunting activities across two farms into the domain of Mr. Ross Nye , a neighborof stern habits and surly disposition . Dutch 's account of the disaster was necessarily prejudiced and untrustworthy , though I can imagine what actually happened . Mr. Nye had ordered Dutch off his land on other occasions , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see Mr. Nye coming up , club in hand ; I can see the trapped terror with which Dutch faced him . " Look here , how many times have I told you to stay away from this place ? " " I was n't hurting anything . I was just looking --  " " Yes , just looking ! Look what you done to those rocks ! You 've been chopping around , doing a lot of damage --  " The big hand closed on Dutch DeHoke 's shirt and shoulder . " Now I 'm going to give you the tanning of your life . " I do n't know how many times the blows fell , though years afterward I learned that in truth they did fall and fall hard . Dutch DeHoke still had his hatchet ; in his hatred and anguish , he struck . An hour afterward a hired man found Ross Nye lying unconscious and lugged him to his house . The first words he uttered were , " Get that crazy Dutch young'un . He blame near murdered me . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know whether or not he would live . That he did live for another truculent and hearty ten years could not have been much satisfaction to any of them . The deputy sheriff and a county supervisor and various interested persons waited with Uncle Billy and red-eyed Aunt Jennie , but Dutch did not reappear at the Renn farm . Aunt Jennie did n't take in any more boys after that . She and Uncle Billy seemed older and more tired . Windflowers still grew in front of the dooryard , the prairie sod was knitted firmly across the earth beyond the gate , but Dutch DeHoke had gone to walk upon other sod , no one knew where . In the 1920s I lived six miles distant from Fairweather Township . Isat in a little office with my name on the door and gilt-lettered signs in the window stating that I dealt in farm titles , abstracts , insurance . Often i sat studying the people who walked our street and wondering about them . Thus I wondered about Dutch DeHoke when he came to move among us once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late winter , and he read my name on the sign and picked his way through the slush to my office door . I did n't know who he was . He wore a heavy , tan overcoat with creases of a city tailor 's pressing still sharp . " I 'd know you anywhere . " He spoke my name . " Remember me ? My name 's DeHoke , Dutch De-Hoke . When we were boys  --  out at the Renn farm --  " I turned on a desk light and motioned Dutch DeHoke into a leather-bottomed chair . We smoked for a while , smiling back and forth . " I guess it is n't true , then . " He had an odd accent which clicked against his words when he spoke . " My reception would have been different , if --  " " If what ? " " If I had killed Ross Nye . " " Lord , no ! He was walking around in four or five days , cross as ever . He was sound and healthy up to the time of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " but I thought I had killed him , Later I decided probably I had n't , but 1 always thought about it . " " Where have you been , Dutch ? " " Bangka , in the Netherlands Indies ; an island east of Sumatra . " I looked at the mighty diamond on his finger and at the three fat cpeaairn.is that hung from his watch chain . " Have you been there all this time ? " " Very nearly . " He had bummed his way to California ; had stowed away on a small boat . They put the boy to work , and later the chief engineer placed him with acquaintances in Malaysia . Thus he had spent that long generation between childhood and earliest middle age , which seems like the longest generation of all . He had no family ; he had money , plenty of money , if one could judge by the few but magnificent jewels he wore . Easter Flowers continued from page 63 few but magnificent jewels he wore . Finally he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose they are dead . " " Uncle Billy 's been gone for some years now , " I said . " Aunt Jennie  --  she is at the county farm . " " At the --  " " The county farm . It was the poorhouse when we were boys . " DeHoke leaned forward in his chair . " Of all the boys they helped , was there no one who could take care of her , now that she 's old ? " " Some were far away , " I said . " You mean me . " " You , of course , and one or two others . But some of them were here , and they did try to help her . Do n't feel too bad about her being at the county farm . It 's a pleasant place and  --  well , it 's better for her , even though people tried to persuade her otherwise , " He was silent for a while . Then , " There is much you are not telling me . " Uncle Billy , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days  --  the boom days . He lost everything he had , including his life , from which he departed after a siege of illness brought on by worry . Strange men drove their car along the Renns ' wintry lane , and they had papers to serve upon Aunt Jennie . There was one of those ads in the county paper reading , " On February 21st I will offer at public auction the following . . . . " They took Aunt Jennie to Sioux City ; Harmon Lundgren lived there . He was one of the boys . Everyone thought that she might be contented at the Lundgrens ' , and the Lundgrens did their best to make her so . They had a hard row to hoe . Aunt Jennie said that she wanted to go home , and she was decisive about it . Todd Ninbauer fell heir to Aunt Jennie next . That marked her return to her own county and even to a farm therein , though it was miles away from Fairweather Township . One spring day she turned up missing ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brush heaps and creek sides in the region . They found Aunt Jennie at last , along toward night , feeling her way down a road which she hoped led toward Nathan 's River . She cried a little and apologized when they caught up with her . " I 'm mighty sorry to cause trouble , " she said . " But I got so lonesome for home ! I figured I better go there . " They tried to explain once more . All about the house being moved to the Nye farm and being made into a chicken coop ; and they gave her additional information about the new primary-road system . A change in highways had doomed the hill where the Renns had once dwelt . Their lane had been widened and graded high . There was nothing left of the Renn farm except a memory , but Aunt Jennie was willing to embrace that memory with delight and hold it to be a fact . In the long run , it was felt that the county farm , of any place available , came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had good food , a warm bed and certain farm sounds about her ; there were a few old neighbors with whom she might talk about the early days . Dutch DeHoke walked up and down my office , with his cigar dead in his mouth . He said once , " Bangka is a long way off . " Those werethe only words he offered in self-extenuation . " Have you got a motorcar ? I would like to go out and see her . " " Very well . We can pick up your things at the hotel on the way back . I want you to stay at my house . " In the car , when we were splashing through the early dusk east of town , Dutch DeFloke said , " I wonder if she 'll recognize me when she sees me . " " She wo n't see you . " " What ? " I explained , " She 's been blind the past five years . " She sat in the long , ugly , golden-oak room which county-farm tradition dignified as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I remember you . That was a long time ago . " She recalled his bad deed , the day he left the Renn place , and she said that Ross Nye was n't hurt half as much as he 'd imagined . " You were a bad boy , " she quavered . " When you were a boy , 1 mean . But I was always mighty fond of you . " Then she asked , her voice shrill , " Did you ever find gold ? " " It was tin , " Dutch said . " Yes , Aunt Jennie , I found it . Away off across the Pacific Ocean . " He tried to tell her some-thing about the tin mines of the Netherlands Indies , but she was n't half listening . " You know pa 's gone , " she mut-tered , and she was referring to Uncle Billy . . . It came finally as I had expected . She told Dutch in confidence , but spiritedly , " I want to go home . " DeHoke said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can come with me to Muntok . I 'll build a house for you . " But she shook her cropped head . " It 's too far away , and ! do n't want to go on the ocean on account of shipwreck . " She got up out of her chair and felt for him . " I want to go home . I 'll be happy there . " Most of the other people present were wiping their eyes , but Dutch DeHoke did n't wipe his . When he had said good-bye to Aunt Jennie and was in the car with me , he seemed angry rather than touched with sadness . " They should have explained to her ! " he insisted over and over . " They should have told her that the house was gone and the hill shoveled away . " " They tried . You see how it is , She -- Do n't think she 's crazy , Dutch . She just wants to go home , and you ca n't blame her for that . " The only time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if the old East Road still ran to the Nye farm . He said later that he should like to borrow my car early the next morning . He borrowed it , all right , and went out to the Thompson R. Nye place and asked Tom Nye how much he would take for his chicken house . Thompson R. Nye thought that Dutch DeHoke was loony , at first ; and so did other people . But within a few hours we were treated to a miracle such as few of us had observed before . It was the miracle of money  --  of wealth readily expended to attain a given object . For instance , there was a hill just above the outskirts of town , and assuredly that hill was on the north bank of Nathan 's River just as the Renn farm had been , though many miles away from the site of the Rena house . Judge Langhorne owned that hill ; folks said that he did n't want to sell , and he did n't  --  not at any reasonable price . When Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . DeHoke bristled his way to the bank , to the long-distance telephone , to the telegraph office , to the bank again . It was the day when Dutch DeHoke made himself known in our county again ; he performed a hundred marvels . Oh , she must have been very kind to him , kinder than any of us knew at the time or know now . He must have dreamed of her often . His childhood had been full of starvation , blows , tortures ; evil had bayed and bitten him , and put strange sores within his spirit . Then Aunt Jennie came along , and she made marks of a different kind upon him . She would have said , if questioned and if able to reply articulately , that she was only performing a selfish act  --  because she dreamed that , in // holding these other boys close , she was holding her two vanished children who had died in the blaze . Before nightfall of that first day , men were fencing the old Langhorne property . They had built huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the ground . Half that day and all that night and into the next morning , the old Renn house came grinding its way up the East Road as fast as men and animals and machines could move it . There was a half-page ad in the Banner-Republican which appeared the next afternoon . Dutch DeFloke wanted to buy every piece of furniture , every dish and shabby little knickknack and rag of carpeting that had ever been used within the Renn house . The generous premium he offered sent farm wives scurrying into garrets and woodsheds and set half the county to dusting off its memory in a search for trivial scraps which might be labeled with the magic name " Resin . " Todd Ninbauer came to help him , and others who had been close to the Renns . They crowded in my office each evening to argue over the authenticity of bedsprings , lamps , kitchen chairs . Aunt Jennie knew nothing of these goings-on . No whisper of this resurrection reached Aunt Jennie 's ears to puzzle and confuse her . The little house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , papered . Occasionally I felt that it was magic of a ghastly and uncertain kind ; it seemed a little like taking the dead from their repose . But in April ' 84 the first week of April I bowed before Dutch 's wisdom . It was a golden magic , after all . Aunt Jennie could now come home , we believed . He had the house ready for her on the day before Easter . We drove out to the county farm , Dutch and Todd Ninbauer and myself , and a few other old neighbors and friends  --  five cars of us . We parked and went inside . Dutch got down on one knee beside Aunt Jennie 's chair and put his hand on her arm . " Come with me now , Aunt Jennie . They 've got your things all packed , and you can come now . " " Where are we going ? " " I 'll take you home . " She sighed , and said , " Well , it 's been a long time ! I 've surely been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Langhorne hill . The warm spring breeze swept against our ears , and the damp pastures breathed out their first sunny smell of green . Dutch DeHoke steered Aunt Jennie in through the kitchen door . Her hands went straying around and then she withdrew from his support and she walked alone , while feeling for the things to touch . " Yes , " she said now and then . " Yes . " In a kind of matter-of-fact way , as if suddenly she had learned the answer to a puzzle which had occupied her for years . She touched her big , green rocker ; then she progressed slowly into the little sitting room , saying that it did seem good to be home . She stopped and listened to the clock , and God made it strike four ; Aunt Jennie nodded her head with each beat of the old brass hammer . When Dutch came close again , she felt for him and squeezed his wrist so hard that the marks of her fingers stayed there . Her voice crackled a little . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was so nice of you to let me come home again ! " Then , when we were able to see , she was on her way down the front steps and saying what a nice day it was . She went through the gate and out onto the fresh-seeded earth beyond the fence . And there Aunt Jennie stopped and seemed perplexed . Dutch spoke under his breath . He started toward her . By that time Aunt Jennie was down on her knees , and her hands were straying aimlessly around her . " Where are they ? " she asked . She was a little frightened . " I ca n't find the grass . I ca n't find any of ' em . Where are they ? " None of us was quite sure what she wanted . We knew only that she needed something desperately and it seemed we could n't give it to her . She said  --  she was not complaining too bitterly , but only stating a fact  --  that she missed them , and something was wrong , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " You know , them little wild crocuses . Easter flowers , I always call ' em . I do n't know what 's come with ' em . The sod 's gone too . " Dutch managed to talk to her . He was thinking wildly , helplessly , of the prairie sod which was torn forever from that farm site and from the Renn farm as well . He croaked something about its not being the proper season for wind-flowers . " How you talk , " said Aunt Jennie sadly . " They 've always been here every springtime ; you know that . Pa always said I wasted a lot of time with ' em . I 'd come out here in the grass  --  you know , the sod was never turned  --  and I 'd look at ' em and feel ' em , all fuzzy and soft . But something 's wrong ; they ai n't here any more . I guess I better go back to that other place . " " But this is home , Aunt Jennie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " You know , at home I always had the little Easter flowers . The little ones . They was whitish and purple , too , and they did n't have much smell . Just a kind of honey smell , I guess , but I liked it . They always grew in the old prairie grass outside the fence every spring . They grew there when 1 was home . " Dutch stood clenching his fists , but Aunt Jennie had made up her mind . The woman who had planned to be her housekeeper and practical nurse signaled the rest of us . She brought Aunt Jennie 's bags and put them into the car , and we droveback to the county farm . I did n't see Dutch until about eight o'clock that night . When he came into my house his feet were muddy . He must have walked for a long time . " I 've got an idea , " he told me . " Where 's the nearest prairie sod ? Sod that a plow has never been through ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's plenty there . But do n't start fretting about it . You ca n't transplant windflowers . They 'll only grow on the prairie . " Dutch cried , " Yes , yes . But I must know . It 's prairie sod , hilltop sod in Eagle County ? " " On the Charles McCoffin farm ; plenty of native sod . I saw the flowers there last year . " Then Dutch DeHoke drank a cup of coffee and put on his hat again . " I guess I ca n't take her to the prairie , " he said , " but I can bring the prairie to her . You say the wind-flowers wo n't grow except on prairie sod , but I will make them keep growing . " He rented trucks and hired the men to go with them . They drove to the Charles McCoffin farm , and they got Charley out of bed . Dutch bought his prairie sod and the men took it up  --  great , thick , fuzzy , flat mattresses of it . All night long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks rumbled across the prairie . The men drove to Aunt Jennie 's house and planted the sod beyond her gate . With Easter morning the unturned grass was blowing , and furry little flowers trembled as the bright air found them . Aunt Jennie found them , too , when Dutch Defloke brought her there once more that day . She sat in the grass , squeezing stems and petals in her frail hands . She said that now there was no mistake , that surely she had come home again as she longed to do . A I hung up . That night I dreamed about a very fat man roaming the streets and wearing 12 shirts and 16 sheets . In the morning I drafted a combative letter to the commissioner of the IRS . But before sending it , I called Mr. Hakimura and offered to read it . " Just make sure you spell my name right , " he said . " H-a-k-a . . " " No ! " he shouted . " It 's H-a-k-i . . . . " " All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy . " I was stamping the envelope when the phone rang . It was Mr. Hakimura . I refused to take the call : The federal government and I were through , finis , kaput . Mysteriously , Mr. Hakimura asked my wife to appear that afternoon at the IRS . At four o'clock she drove there and was handed a large bundle of dirty laundry . The shirts , Mr. Hakimura said , had been found in a rag bin at the cleaning plant . On hands and knees , my wife counted the laundry before an office full of IRS agents . She discovered that we had been given two extra shirts and three extra sheets . Mr. Hakimura refused to take them back . " We 're not in the laundry business , " he said grandly . " And one more thing . Your husband 's a grouch . " Actually there was one more thing . This year a deduction on my return for the cleaning and pressing of office curtains ( business maintenance , Section 162 , Internal Revenue Code ) is being questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
