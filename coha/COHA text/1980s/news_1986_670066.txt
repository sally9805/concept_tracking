LUODING , China  --  One day in April , workers at Tan Dinghan ' s chicken farm decided to go to town to have some fun . They left the farm unattended . A storm came , blew down the farmhouse and killed all the chickens . Mr. Tan fired the workers , hired new ones and paid them higher wages . To no avail : The 36-year-old **26;382;TOOLONG says the new workers are no more responsible than their predecessors . " Their concepts haven ' t changed a bit , " he says . " They always say : ' It ' s the boss ' s business . Why should we care ? ' " Not far away , two water buffaloes stroll past Lan Jiaxin ' s factory , which makes scarves and plastic bags . Inside , Mr. Lan , barefoot with his trousers rolled up to his knees , scratches his head . " How can I persuade banks to lend me 35 , 000 yuan ( $9 , 480 ) ? " Mr. Lan asks . He needs the money to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t trust him because his factory doesn ' t have an impressive track record , he says . Like Mr. Tan and Mr. Lan , many Chinese peasants are finding that an entrepreneur ' s life isn ' t easy . Not only do they have to tackle new concepts such as marketing and cost control but , like capitalists world-wide , these businessmen must battle with workers , bankers , bureaucrats and customers . Even so , China ' s new breed of " peasant entrepreneurs , " to use Peking ' s official designation , is gaining prominence in the countryside  --  and attracting admiration and envy . It was only in 1984 that Peking removed the prohibition against people in rural areas engaging in industry or commerce . Since then , many peasants have begun making shoes or other industrial goods at home . More-ambitious peasants have formed their own companies or opened factories employing staffs ranging from dozens to hundreds . Peking doesn ' t have a clear policy on private enterprises , either urban or rural . Yet it tolerates , if not encourages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enterprises they own  --  not to do so would be regarded as exploitation  --  Peking appears satisfied . During more than three decades of communism , most forms of private enterprise were discouraged . Thus , many of the peasant entrepreneurs have little experience of the world of commerce . Some enterprises have failed , but most have continued to struggle and prosper . For many of the rural entrepreneurs , running businesses has brought them wealth , excitement and status , they say . " The status of an entrepreneur is higher than that of a peasant , " says Mr. Lan . " I hate to work under the scorching sun . I like to use my brain . " Ou Shencai , who owns a factory that makes bamboo dim sum steaming baskets that are sold as far away as the U.S. , has seen his business expand steadily since opening in October 1984 . Mr. Ou initially hired 12 workers . After one month , he increased his work force to 30 , after three months to 50 and today there are 80 . Mr. Ou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total profit of more than $40 , 000  --  a fortune by Chinese standards . He bought a piece of land from the government and has spent $16 , 000 building a two-story factory on the site . The factory is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year . " By then , I ' ll hire 40 more workers , " he says . Mr. Ou is a born capitalist . " I know nothing about making bamboo baskets , " he says . He got the idea after seeing a government-run bamboo-basket factory in his village flourish for 10 years . " If they can survive for 10 years , business must be darn good . " Indeed it is . Domestic and foreign demand for bamboo baskets is so great that his factory is struggling to meet it . Transport is a major problem , though . There often aren ' t enough trucks to take his baskets to the Shenzhen special economic zone , from where they are delivered to his agents in Hong Kong , who reship them to the U.S. and elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several of his workers to take driving lessons and he is saving money to buy a van . Mr. Ou seems to have a talent for personnel management . He says his workers are well paid and never complain . He has installed television and table-tennis sets in their hostel and occasionally provides workers with free movie tickets , and salary advances in emergencies . " I play basketball with them too , " he says . " A successful entrepreneur should always cultivate good relationships with workers . " But many peasant bosses have had rough times . In early 1985 when Mr. Lan and two partners started their Fuge Daily Knitted Products Factory to make scarves and plastic bags , they could afford to pay workers only half their monthly wages and promised to pay the balance at the end of the year . To survive , the company was forced to sell 28 sewing machines and now has only 20 machines . Without working capital , the factory can ' t expand . Moreover , Mr. Lan , who manages the factory , is having problems on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find customers , " he says . " It ' s difficult to break into markets in neighboring counties . " Even so , Mr. Lan is luckier than many other businessmen , such as Huang Jincheng . Mr. Huang , who started a refining operation last year to produce a flavoring essence for export , made $19 , 000 profit during the year . But by early 1986 he found it hard to sell his product because other Chinese essence companies had saturated overseas markets . Mr. Huang closed the plant in March and laid off his 14 employees . He now works as a foreman for a construction company . Many private businessmen in Luoding who have made handsome profits plan to expand operations with their newly earned income . " We want to become as big as possible , " says Ou Kerong , one of the bamboo-basket factory ' s partners . Other peasant entrepreneurs have used their profits to build new houses or otherwise improve their living conditions . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
