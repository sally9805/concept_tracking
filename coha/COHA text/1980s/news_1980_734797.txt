txt N ANCY REAGAN 'S training for the role of First Lady springs from near-tragic beginnings , not the silver-spoon existence that would follow . With obvious vain and discomfort Mrs. Reagan recalls her childhood years , a time fraught with loneliness and separation that probably explains her idolatry of the kind or family unit straight out of " Ozzie and Harriet . " In " Nancy , ' her autobiography , she is reticent on several topics : She does n't mention the name of Jane Wyman , Reagan 's first wife , with whom he had two children , Maureen and Mike . She glosses over the fact that her stepfather also was divorced , that Maureen has been divorced .. twice , and that her mother was divorced . And her early childhood recollections are recounted in just a few tormented pages , as if dwelling on them rattles her comforting idealization of life .

Nancy was waiting for him in the city when the devastating telephone call came . During her senior year at Smith , Nancy Davis suffered the breakup of another engagement . " AT SMITH I learned that life is not always easy , and romances do not always have romantic endings , " she says . " I went through difficult changes and emotional experiences , and I ' learned that you have to take life as it comes , and be prepared for sudden twists of fate . But I have always been a romantic .

In the summer of 1949 , on the strength of a screen test arranged by family friend Spencer Tracy and directed by George Cukor , Nancy Davis landed a seven-year contract at MetroGoldwyn-Mayer , joining a vast stable of actors and actresses who had arrived just in time to witness the agonizing demise of the omnipotent studios and the star system . Davis ' film career was not particularly successful . Between 1999 and 1956 she appeared in 11 films , none of ? ? which came close to being hits . Despite her contacts , . thanks to her mother 's background , the career of this Junior Leaguer-gone-Hollywood went nowhere . FOR ALL HER designs on an acting career , marriage and a family persisted as her passion and priority . " I never was really a career girl , " she said 20 years later .

" She was an Actress , so she was far from being a square . We found her mannered , always in control , with a great sense of humor about herself . In this business , if you give yourself away too easily , you destroy yourself . She seemed to know that . She was a realist . " TO THIS DAY , Nancy Reagan maintains that she whispers a little prayer every night for director Mervyn LeRoy . In 1951 LeRoy introduced tancy to .

" After all , here was a man internationally renowned in the world of surgery , a fearless stickler for principle , and a man who could no more choose the easy path of expediency than he could rob the poor box . " A doctor who studied under Loyal Davis recalls him as " one of the meanest , toughest , commielating , narrow-minded , John Birching , ultraconservative hellions " he 'd ever met .
