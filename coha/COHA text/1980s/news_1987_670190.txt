Japan ' s Ministry of Finance is considering a rule change that could reduce Japanese life insurers ' huge appetite for dollar-denominated investments . At issue is whether the life insurance companies can use capital gains from their portfolio holdings to pay dividends to investment clients , rather than only using current income . At this time , the Japanese insurers generally must pay dividends only from current income such as bond coupon yields and stock dividends . As a result , Japanese insurers have flocked to U.S. bonds , which currently yield 9% or more , well above the rates on Japanese debt securities . They also have bought high-yielding bonds denominated in Canadian and Australian dollars and British pounds . At the end of last year , Japan ' s life insurance companies and postal system had $61. 1 billion invested in U.S. and other non-Japanese securities , according to the Bank of Japan . That total is believed to have climbed substantially this year . But the life insurers are negotiating with the Ministry of Finance to change the dividend-payment rule . Japanese news reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the start of the next fiscal year . " The reason we put a lot of money into foreign countries is because we get a higher yield than in domestic investments , " Shigeru Nihei , a representative of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. in New York , said . If the current restrictions on dividend payments are lifted , he said , " We wouldn ' t have to rely on the income gain only , but ( instead ) the total return , including capital gains . " In the first seven months of this year , Japanese investors added a total of $57. 41 billion of foreign bonds and $11. 48 billion of foreign equities to their portfolios , according to Salomon Brothers Inc . As of May 31 , life insurers held $74. 1 billion of foreign securities , about 30% of all Japanese foreign holdings . Overall , analysts estimate that 60% to 65% of Japanese foreign bond holdings are dollar-denominated and that perhaps 90% of Japan ' s foreign equities holdings are in U.S. shares . These investments have played a big role in financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have helped keep the dollar from falling still further on foreign exchange markets . Furthermore , Japanese institutions ' purchases and sales of U.S. stocks and bonds have at times been cited as a major reason for U.S. market rallies and declines . If the dividend rule is changed , the big Japanese life insurers wouldn ' t suddenly dump their dollar holdings . But Yasukazu Akamatsu , a senior managing director for Daiwa International Capital Management Co. in Tokyo , said the prospective change could decrease the relative appeal of high-yielding dollar securities . The effect would be greater on new investments than on existing holdings , he said . " With new investments , they will have more leeway , more authority to choose , " he said . The move also could eventually add to the pressure for higher interest rates in the U.S. as demand for dollar-denominated investments eases . In addition , Mr. Nihei of Sumitomo Life predicted that Japanese investors will move cash in and out of foreign markets more aggressively , based on currency expectations . " There will be more volatility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 would be too early an effective date for such a regulatory change because it would be difficult to separate the capital gains of old and new policyholders . Resolving such matters might take another year , he said . The volatility that Mr. Nihei fears for foreign markets could occur in Tokyo ' s market as well . A rule change " will intensify competition among insurance companies for capital gains , " Ryujiro Miki , an assistant manager at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo , said . The result , he warned , could be " a mess in the Tokyo market in equities and bonds . " Mr. Miki said the rule change wouldn ' t drastically affect Dai-Ichi Life , as the company has been preparing for such a change for some time . Many Japanese institutions have created investment trusts and other intermediary bodies that can make capital gains and pay them to the parent company as dividends , partly circumventing the dividend restrictions . Even if the change is made , Daiwa ' s Mr. Akamatsu said , " The dollar still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Keiji Tsuda , a vice president at Nissei BOT Asset Management Corp. , a joint venture of Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Bank of Tokyo , said that although a rule change could significantly affect some Japanese overseas investment , it wouldn ' t affect the " basic investment attitude " of Japan ' s institutions . One executive cited the need for Japanese institutions to learn in foreign markets about hedging techniques and sophisticated investment instruments that aren ' t available in the Tokyo market .
