It lay somewhere between the Proustian ambience of Woody Allen 's films and the never-never land of the Emerald City : a town of tart talk and smooth tunes , where women sported black silk stockings and Cadillacs purred down clean streets kept orderly by serried ranks of trusted policemen . The skyline , crowned by the 1,250-ft . Empire State Building , was the most imposing man-made sight in the world , and at night it glowed with the fires of 2 million aspirations . Visitors to Grand Central Station , where the trains were out of sight and the zodiac was on the ceiling , could get information on any subject whatsoever  --  and they did , 167,000 times a year . The glorious profligacy of the place was astounding : " Why , " remarked one astonished observer , " the garbage thrown away in this city every day  --  every day  --  would feed the whole of Europe for a week . " <P> Or so writes British Travel Writer Jan Morris in a valentine to New York City in 1945 that might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men returned from war victorious and well-mannered ; the first thing they asked for when they disembarked was milk . Half the earth 's races huddled together in picturesque , cheek-by-jowl harmony . The subways , " awful and astonishing in about equal measure , " cost only a nickel to ride . Grover Whalen , a flamboyant Irishman with a flower in his lapel , was glad-handing the visiting firemen as the city 's official greeter , while saturnine Robert Moses , the master builder , was sundering neighborhoods in the name of progress . The cafe-society swells watered at El Morocco or the Stork Club , and the punters headed for Toots Shor 's , mindful of the proprietor 's dictum that " a bum who ai n't drunk by midnight ai n't trying . " It was , in short , a wonderful town . <P> A little too wonderful , perhaps . In a series of vignettes organized by topic ( " On Style , " " On System , " " On Race , " etc . ) , Morris stages an uncritical celebration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's restaurants get seven , and " Smelly " Kelly , who sniffed out gas leaks along the IND subway tracks , gets one . Morris , whose customary voice is that of cool detachment , allows a gee-whiz tone to mar the text : " Where else , in 1945 , could you have your photograph taken by an unmanned machine ( the Photomaton ) , or go to a theatre on the fiftieth floor of a skyscraper ( the Chanin Building ) , or for that matter get an electric shock just from touching a door handle , in a city so charged with energy that the very air tingled with it ? " Certainly not in drab , dreary , bombed-out London . And there are some unaccustomed small inaccuracies that further tarnish the golden glow : the PATH commuter trains from New Jersey are not officially part of the city subway system , and Van Cortlandt Park is in the Bronx , more than six miles north of Harlem . <P> Still , New Yorkers weary of the slough of dirt , drugs and despond that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the garbage thrown away in Europe every week would n't equal the trash deposited on streets of Manhattan every day . But in those days it really was , in John Cheever 's phrase , " a long-lost world when the city of New York was still filled with river light . . . and when almost everybody wore a hat . " And now it is not .
