THE WILD , WILD YEAR OF POLITICS 1980 Are presidential campaigns designed by the inane for the insane ? Compelling evidence piling up indicates this election year will be one of the wackiest , least logical ever . by William Barry Furlong Illustrated byfared Lee Tr he tune was familiar . But the 1 words were all wrong  --  in precisely the right way . The occasion was a roasting-boasting kind of dinner that is a Big Occasion in Washington  --  the Gridiron Dinner of 1973 . Onstage was a media-man pretending to be Ted Kennedy in a satirical skit . The tune was from Casablanca , the old Humphrey Bogart/Ingrid Bergman movie ? " As Time Goes By , " with special words that had the edge of malice : It 's still the same old story  --  A lust for fame and glory , A taste for flying high . But still the nagging question comes Can I get by ? In the weeks and months to come  --  in the whole wild , turbulent year that will be 1980 ? this is a question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . It is perhaps the centerpiece of the cycle of presidential elections : Will this nation select as president a man who it has reason to believe failed to meet his basic resonsibilities to another human being  --  and thus left her for dead ? But it is only the centerpiece . Around it will be a series of events that will be wild , bizarre , frenzied , bordering on the berserk . They will appeal to the eye , the ear , the heart , the emotions  --  anything but the mind . For presidential campaigns seem to be designed by the inane for the insane . And this is seen most clearly  --  and most hilariously  --  when you stand off a bit and look at the whole thing with a slightly different angle of vision . Consider : Does it seem logical to you . ? That there is a sizable body of public opinion that believes Ted Kennedy would make a good president for no other reason than that his brother Jack was president ? ( " If I were cut down by an assassin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago Tribune , " would the editors of this newspaper turn immediately to my brother to carry on the torch of the column ? Of course not . My brother Tim is a bartender at a place called the Blue Note in Boulder , Colorado . . . . It is only in the loony worlds of politics and media that a man is automatically assumed to have a birthright to a job  --  i.e. , the presidency  --  because his brother had it before him . It makes no sense , of course , especially knowing many of the things that we know about Ted Kennedy .. . . Would anybody clamor for Billy Carter to take over the White House if anything happened to the President ... ? " ) ? That Jimmy Carter , who comes over on TV like a wet dishrag , would seek to debate a Ted Kennedy on TV ? That a rather small , mumbling , almost shrunken man who smiles as if it hurts his hemorrhoids would want to be compared side by side on TV with an expansive , handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he is , a man who lusts in his heart , and in every pore of his skin , for the presidency ? ( Mary McGrory , a columnist for the Washington Star , offered a clue : " ... Away from the prepared text in the face-to-face encounter , Kennedy is rambling , halting , and uncertain when he starts a sentence of where it will all end . He could in debate , the White House must be thinking , do the impossible : that is make murmuring ( and mumbling ) Jimmy Carter sound crisp and forceful . " ) ? That we would see such improbable calisthenics as Ronald Reagan rushing left , Ted Kennedy rushing right and Jerry Brown rushing both ways at the same time ? ( Columnist David Broder of the Washington Post commenting on Jerry Brown 's drive to be known as both a liberal and a conservative : " . . . exploring space while cutting spending , for example . His embrace of seeming opposites looks innovative to his followers ; but to others it appears as contrived and self-serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence is already piling up that 1980 will be the looniest , least logical election year of all . And yet it will be one of the most meaningful and significant presidential elections in our history . Indeed , 1980 may be recognized as a great watershed of American history , a year in which the people  --  in the freest expression of will allowed anywhere in the world  --  will make a series of profound decisions , only a few of which will be listed on the election-year ballot . For example : In 1980 , we will see whether : ? The " politics of glamour " will further weaken the " politics of party . " Certainly the campaign technique of Ted Kennedy and the success of John Y. Brown and his wife  --  a former Miss America  --  in the Kentucky gubernatorial race reflect the continuing rise of the " politics of glamour . " Brown , in particular , offered a new dimension to the process . In the past , TV contributed mightily to the decline of the political parties . A candidate did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently for generations to rise through one to high office  --  once he found he could get votes and money through his appearances on television . But the party was still considered useful if he was in politics as a profession or as an avocation . Even the Kennedys followed that tradition . The significance of the John Y. Brown election is that it demonstrated that an individual does n't have to be in politics at all to get elected . John Y. was n't ; he was everything from an encyclopedia salesman to a fast-food huckster before he decided to become a statesman . He ' was elected as a Democrat but he was elected because he projected so powerful a sense of glamour and celebrity . And this is likely to be the most profound lesson , within politics , of the next generation of candidates . ? The Republicans will not only win the White House but also take control of the Senate for the first time in almost 30 years . The reason for the opportunity : Of the 34 Senate seats up for re-election , 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 10 of those 24 seats away from the Democrats  --  while holding all its own , of course  --  to have a majority in the Senate . ? The people will be blocked from discussing openly and in great detail some of the more critical issues facing the nation . Most of the candidates are using personality , not issues , to advance themselves . To be sure , Ted Kennedy as a senator has offered a health insurance plan ( nothing to compare with it has been offered by the GOP ) and an energy plan , but they are likely to be neglected in favor of a smiling and reminiscent personality in his plea to the voters . Democratic Governor Jerry Brown of California has approached the discussion of achieving safe nuclear power but has done so mostly by suggesting the end to nuclear power as the only way of achieving safety  --  which does not reassure many people about the depth of his mind . ( " He is not a flake ! " insists one of his campaign workers  --  uttering the most memorable campaign cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Connally alone  --  who broached the most refreshing and insight-filled idea-on-an-issue : He suggested a complex program to end the generations-long war in the Middle East . It asserted that the oil supply , and its price , must be recognized as part of a political settlement . He suggested  --  among a good many other things  --  that the Arabs agree to go to a stable oil-pricing system in exchange for the Israelis giving up their land-acquisition program . He did not propose that the U.S. retreat from its commitments to support Israel 's security ; indeed , he suggested putting U.S. troops in the Middle East to inhibit the outbreak of war . But that did not , he said , mean the U.S. had to support and endorse everything the Israelis might choose to do : " A clear distinction must be drawn between support for Israel 's security  --  which is a moral imperative  --  and support for Israel 's broader territorial acquisitions . " Connally 's plan was far from perfect ; it demanded great investigation and debate . But it was frank and innovative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered up for years . Unfortunately , there are a number of foreign interests which have a stake in continuing the unrest in the Middle East  --  including the Soviets and the extremist elements in the PLO among them . So Connally 's plan was discussed  --  even by elements within the U.S. ? as " reckless , " " pernicious " and " perilous . " Thus Continued on page 18 the function of a presidential election and its glory  --  the discussion of great public issues by the electorate  --  was frustrated by a special interest group . The best that can be said is that some people are measuring the candidates not on their stands on the issues but on their potential impact on the issues  --  should they ever care to tackle them . " Edward Kennedy has developed into an able and articulate senator concerned with a constantly expanding area of interests , " Mrs. George Farenthold , president of Wells College , told The Saturday Evening Post . She is " Sissy " Farenthold , once a prominent politician in Texas and  --  in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for president or ( under George McGovern in 1972 ) vice president herself . Now she says of Ted Kennedy : " He also has the gift to motivate others , an essential antidote to our national political lethargy . " Other people see the race developing in a different way . " The Kennedy aura will fade , " says Senator John R. Chaffee , a Republican from Rhode Island . " The incumbency will prevail while Kennedy will always have another chance . ' " Senator William L. Armstrong , a Republican from Coloredo , also thinks  --  on contemplating events in the opposite party  --  that it will still " be Carter . Mostly because he is the first Southern president since the Civil War , and to be chased out of the race by a Northerner ( i.e. , Kennedy ) would be highly unlikely . The Democratic schism will become more evident as the contest builds and will eventually split the party . Kennedy was more attractive as a non-candidate . " While there is some discussion of the impact of personality on issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it is a measure of the wild , improbable course of politics in 1980 that one U.S. senator picks a particular personality . . . for the opposition : " Stassen ! " says Democratic Senator James J. Exon as his choice for the Republican nominee . Well , humor ... or satire ... or plain foolishness is a part of any presidential campaign . Some of it is quite conscious . Ronald Reagan 's current joke is to say that he had a physical checkup before entering the campaign : " The doctor told me I was sound as a dollar and I almost fainted . " Some of it is unconscious : Pulitzer prizewinning historian Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , wrote earnestly that Ted Kennedy 's participation in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick " would make him a better president " ? leaving open to Kennedy 's opponents the speculation of how many young women would have to die in conjunction with Ted 's activities in order for him to become merely an adequate president . Some of it is aimed at the candidates : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful for  --  that Teddy is not a Republican . " But you have to leave it to Bob Orben , the gifted humorist who was chief of President Ford 's speech-writing staff , to offer insight as well as laughs with his observations about politics , politicians and their habits : " Thanksgiving and Christmas are when you live with a turkey for weeks , " he said of the holidays . " Elections are when you get to live with a turkey for years . " " You know what really worries me ? " he said of the Democratic race . " Millions of Americans are fighting to keep their heads above water and who are they turning to ? Ted Kennedy ! " " I love presidential campaigns , " he said of so many candidates comparing themselves favorably with near-70ish Ronald Reagan . " At what other time do you see people Continued on page 22 in their 50s capitalizing on their youth ? " " I see where the government is bailing out Chrysler because 200,000 jobs are at stake , " he said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " And then there was the way Or-ben put himself in danger of being catapulted into presidential contention by his solution for two problems : " I have this marvelous dream that the third largest auto company in the United States merges with the Department of Energy  --  and within three months there are n't enough Chryslers to go around . " It is sometimes hard for politicians to keep up with the laughter ? if only because their tendency is to make fools of themselves . It is one of the delights of the current campaign to see how often the politicians indulge that habit  --  by making themselves victims of their own manipulations . Take Senator Baker . He carefully arranged his formal entry into the GOP race by making his announcement on a Thursday and then winging off to Maine  --  after recruiting 50 national political correspondents to fly with him  --  to stage his first great pre-convention victory : a weekend win in a straw vote among Republicans in Maine . He neglected one detail : He lost the straw vote . The only man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush . His own campaign manager proclaimed that " Maine is n't very important " ? and he 'd signaled his own enthusiasm by a lonely automobile trip up to Maine in a rented car , accompanied by his wife and no political correspondents . He made a speech and got out of town as fast as he could  --  and thereby won the straw vote . It may have signaled an entirely new way to go about campaigning to victory  --  even if it is a victory which somehow escaped the attention of the candidates . Including George Bush . Another presidential candidate saw his early campaign strategy collapse like a tired souffl ? . He was Governor Jerry Brown of California and he was stirring out from California to assert that he should be in the White House in order to " preserve the earth .. .. " ( " It 's the first time that he 's ever made any sense , " said his father , ex-governor Pat Brown  --  making everybody wonder what Jerry 's been up to all these years if his father did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry sent a " point team " into the Outback  --  the wilderness of America east and north of California  --  to see what the aborigines were up to . The " point team " was made up of movie star Jane Fonda , radical leader Tom Hayden who is Fonda 's husband ) and their entourage . It tells you what the 1980 presidential campaign is like when you consider that a young ex-Jesuit seeking the presidency had to send out a 40-year-old movie actress and a rheumy radical to look things over for him . Ostensibly , the Fonda-Hayden team was traveling around the United States to campaign against nuclear power . It is a significant issue and one which the people must consider carefully . But the trouble with the Fonda-Hayden approach  --  as a hilarious symbol of the 1980 campaign  --  is that it is so simplistic : They want to eliminate nuclear accidents by eliminating nuclear fission ! The parallel is pointed and inescapable : You could eliminate sunburn by eliminating the sun . You could eliminate automobile accidents by eliminating the wheel . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't eliminate an important thought  --  that this is a pre-kindergarten approach to political science : Smash everything and claim that solves the problem . The Continued on page 26 Fonda-Hayden approach may not be very useful to those Americans who want to examine the issue intelligently , but it does say something important about a certain kind of political participation : Do n't let a Californian near a great issue with a hammer in his hands . To be fair about it , the Fonda-Hayden mission may not have been intended to arouse a serious discussion of the issue . There was a powerful feeling in the media that they were simply traveling around America to use the issue to build the nucleus ( if you 'll pardon the expression ) of a national political army for Jerry Brown . The idea is that they chose the most simplistic approach to find people  --  presumably those who function most comfortably on the level of the single-cell amoeba  --  who would most naturally fit into a Jerry Brown campaign . It is not an easy assignment . Not because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are remarkably stupid , even for politics  --  but because of a less pronounced reason . You see , Tom Hayden is not just trying to get Jerry Brown into the White House  --  do us some other favor , Tom  --  but he 's trying earnestly to get him out of California . By 1982 . That 's when Jerry 's term as governor ends and , pre suming he wo n't seek a third t as governor , there 's only one of office he 'd likely seek : the U.S. St ate seat now held by Republican S.I . Hayakawa . But Tom Hayden would also like to grab Hayakawa 's seat . He does not want to have a Tom-and-Jerry show in the 1982 California primary ; he wants Jerry safely out of the way in the White House  --  where he ca n't do much harm , except to the rest of us  --  so that it will be strictly a Tom-and-Jane show ( " I Tom ; you Jane . Let 's go out to the jungle and fight against the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fonda-Hayden anti-nuke campaign came when Tom Hayden was asked whether he 'd run for the Senate in 1982 and you realized  --  from his pained denials  --  that it was not that Tom Hayden had not yet learned to act like a politician . It was that he had n't learned to lie like one . As far as Jerry Brown was concerned , he found that the Fonda-Hayden campaign had one perceptible impact : His popularity in the polls went down . Then he formally entered the presidential race and the polls indicated his popularity dropped still further . In a straw poll among Democrats in Iowa his rating fell below one percent . When you consider that he was splitting the vote with only two other candidates  --  Kennedy and Carter  --  that suggests to most observers he was less than a triumph as a proclaimed candidate . ( " One butcher I know is featuring a Jerry Brown-Jane Fonda turkey , " said humorist Bob Orben before Thanksgiving . " Two left wings and it ca n't get off the ground . " ) When the Des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the various presidential candidates , Brown was pointedly left out . Only Carter and Kennedy were included on the Democratic side . Brown  --  who 'd previously indicated he was not much interested in the Iowa caucuses  --  decided he was outraged . " I will go to Des Moines , " he said in a strangled voice , as if he felt that going to Iowa in the winter was about as pleasant as being guest of honor at a public execution . He had not yet faced up to one of the ironic facts of the current campaign : Going to Iowa might only drive his popularity ra ! ? igs lower . ere is another irony to this id wacky political campaign . I ' ; ' iat so many people are run11 3 hard to be second in the pr not just Jerry Brown , for wl. , , I being second would be an improvement , or for most of the many GOP candidates marching in lock step behind Ronald Reagan . But even Ted Kennedy : He got into the race because the polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes 3-to-1 . But once in , he began claiming he was an underdog . But why ? Because the press gangs up on the front-runners : There is nothing so joyful to the press as bringing down a king . Or a president . Politicians know that the best way to keep the press from ravaging you  --  mercilessly , even irrationally  --  is to be in second place , not first , and thus to be the ultimate beneficiary of the bloodletting . The techniques of the press are to make a victory seem like a loss . They decide ahead of time what percentage of the votes a candidate needs to " win " an election or primary , and if he does n't get that percentage , then he " lost " the election . LBJ beat Senator Gene McCarthy in the New Hampshire primary in 1968 ; Continued on page 124 proaches to coronary artery disease , people want to know what I am doing . From a work standpoint , I 'm in a unique situation . I 've been in the community long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . They know I 'm assisting in surgery at a neighboring hospital and that I wish to hold down my own practice to two cases per week . They 've actually told me that if I 've already done two cases that particular week , they 'll try again the next week . How can you beat that sort of friendship and good will amongst your colleagues ? As to physical fitness , I admit I hate jogging and I 'm doing only one mile three times a week , but I know I 'll get up to that three-mile requirement . Again , its just a matter of discipline and survival  --  I am now playing vigorous singles tennis with no fatigue at all . It is a known fact that 5 grains of aspirin per day will reduce clotting in the arteries . This can be taken with breakfast . I 'm taking 250 milligrams of nicotinic acid three times daily in a long-acting form called disease . If you are in the range of the 40s or low 50s , you had better readjust your physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're overweight , and start the nicotinic acid routine all under the guidance of your physician . Reduce the stress in your life , whether it be in the office or at home . Obviously , the jogging does n't begin until you 've been cleared with a stress test . Finally , if the stress test indicates there is coronary insufficiency , your cardiologist or personal physician may suggest an angiogram . If you recall the beginning of my story , there was no easy way to evaluate the severity of my coronary occlusive disease until I had the dye study . It is n't just survival we are seeking . It should be a joy of living each day . In order to accomplish this , you must enjoy your work , try a little kindness to casual friends and really know your family and their needs . Then perhaps some of that stress will subside , and you can truly enjoy a full life . v : Politics ' 80 continued from page 26 the press said he 'd lost the elec-tion  --  and shortly afterward he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muskie won the New Hamp-shire primary in 1972 by an almost 2-to-1 margin over Senator George McGovern and saw the press insist that it was a grievous loss ; he lost momentum , personnel and money , and had to drop out of the race . The trick these days is to win the various polls and primaries without the media quite noticing that you 've won . For once they notice , they say you really lost so they can force you out of the race . One tantalizing example came last October when Jimmy Carter won a 2-to-1 mar-gin of victory over Ted Kennedy in a straw vote in Florida . In its news-section hype for Senator Kennedy , the Washington Post printed a story on page four showing that , by the Post 's own measurements , Carter got 65 per-cent of the vote and Kennedy got 31 percent . On page Nicobid , which has been easy on my stomach and caused almost no skin flushing . Since we know that serum cholesterol studies are almost useless for people over 50 , that group must rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was pleased to find my HDL was 68mgidl , which is well in the range of low coronary artery disease incidence . How about all of you between 35 and 60 years of age ? What should you be doing ? Remember that tennis really never helped prevent my coronary . You must have some sustained form of exercise . It is a fact that singles tennis expends 430 calories per hour and jogging uses up to 675 calories in the same time period . I believe you should go to a reliable laboratory and get accurate measurement of your lipids . Go to two laboratories for comparison studies . If you find your HDL is 60 or above , you 're lucky . You probably wo n't develop coronary arteryone  --  where it would get far more attention  --  the Post ran an interpretive story asserting that Carter had really lost to Kennedy in Florida , though he 'd etched a 2-to-1 lead over the favorite . ( " President Shown Vulnerable to Kennedy ... Somehow , in both interpretation and in reporting , the Post ignored two facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Carter , and that this was only the second time in history that any Kennedy had lost an election . The first time was when Bobby Kennedy lost the Oregon primary in 1968 . ) To Carter , there was only one daemonic possibility : that the Washington Post would proclaim every Carter win a loss  --  with the rest of the media tagging dumbly behind  --  until the Washington Post forced Carter out of the race , leaving the loser , Ted Kennedy , as victor . To be sure , Ted Kennedy has himself felt Cont. on following page the sting of being a front runner . As soon as he plunged formally into the race , the press  --  which had confined itself merely to fawning in his pre-contest period  --  began nibbling around the edges of the Camelot legend . ( " Camelittler snapped a normally loyal Kennedy columnist . ) In some segments of the media , there were vague suggestions that perhaps Teddy is not too bright  --  certainly not as bright as his brothers  --  if he does n't have a prepared statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk on his feet  --  he tended to use " uhs " and " ers " instead of verbs ... or facts  --  because he really did n't have any feel for the issues . ( " What is er uh Teddy 's uh uh I.Q. ? " asked a reader 's letter to a normally pro-Kennedy newspaper . ) No longer were the media examining the skills shown by Ted Kennedy in the Senate ; instead they were suggesting that he had not accomplished anything in his 17 years in the Senate that he was n't demanding that President Carter accomplish in three years in the White House . Some media people were even suggesting that he had some responsibility in driving his wife to alcoholism  --  and into a separation which led to her attempted recovery ? through his philandering . To be sure , the criticism was not universal : The New Republic obligingly dropped an article on Senator Kennedy 's womanizing , and the news section of the Washington Post made sure that it was n't out in front in investigating the events of Chappaquiddick . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in the Wall Street Journal and the crosstown rival Washington Star before the Washington Post recognized Chappaquiddick as a story  --  a week or ten days after the other media and four months after The Saturday Evening Post . Despite all this , nobody  --  but n o - body ? went at Kennedy with the tough questions and got an answer which sufficed . Not ABC-TV , not the Wall Street Journal . Not CBS  --  which won applause for serving softballs . ( Kennedy kept saying , " I 'll answer any question you ask , " and the viewer got the feeling that CBS ' Roger Mudd had no tough questions to ask ) . Certainly not the Washington Post . The toughest question  --  the one that should have been asked , but was n't  --  is simply this : " Senator Kennedy , the evidence is that Mary Jo Kopechne died of suffocation , not of drowning . It appears that she died many hours after the accident , her fingers clawed to find the last bit of air . It appears also that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the minutes and hours after the accident you did not bother to summon the professional help which might have saved her life . Instead you say you asked a couple of friends to leave an alcohol-hazed party to try to help her instead of making a single phone call to the police , from a phone near the accident , which might have saved her life . Moreover , you and your two friends were lawyers and none of the three of you obeyed a very basic law : to report an accident immediately . Instead you went back to your hotel room and slept it all off . Perhaps while she suffocated . And waited for you to save her . Now this suggests that you were indifferent to your responsibilities as a member of the human race , to your responsibilities as a lawyer , to your responsibilities as a friend . Did you , in fact , ignore these basic responsibilities ? If so , why ? And was there any discussion with your lawyer-friends that it might be better to walk away from the accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to rescue her alive  --  and face embarrassing questions of how the two of you got there in the first place ? " These are questions which must not only be offered to Senator Kennedy but which demand corroboration from his lawyer-friends . They demand the formal setting which suggests the penalties of perjury and perhaps even support by lie-detector examinations if one is to resolve them beyond all doubt . But that forum does not exist and is never likely to exist . Thus the only alternative is the extension of the faith and charity of the Judaic-Christian relationship : to believe that any individual who had  --  in conscience  --  to answer " yes " to any of those questions could not . within himself , go through the charade of pretending to be fit for the presidency . In any case , " charade " is itself becoming an issue in the campaign . Ronald Reagan opened his formal campaign by bending his head to interviewers so they could see that the roots of his hair were indeed dark , that he did not dye his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . It felt thick and soft and dry , " reported a newspaper reporter  --  female . One who was wonderfully unconscious of the absurdity of it all . ) Reagan also denied that he 'd had a facelift . ( " ... It leaves little tiny scars behind your ears . You can look for yourself . " The woman reporter looked and found no scars . " If I 'd had one a facelift , " said Reagan , " I 'd hope to look better than I look . " ) But George Bush had a little more trouble . He looked so cerebral and Ben Franklin-ish  --  particularly wearing his half-lens glasses  --  that one of his major backers said he had to appear more forceful if he wanted to keep his backing . So Bush threw away his half-lens glasses . He hired a voice coach . And he began practicing gestures which would make him appear more forceful and dynamic in public . But charades alone wo n't do it . Nor will force and dynamism . It helps to have ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an organization . That 's one of the reasons that campaign-watchers are looking at a significant interior contest in the GOP race : the one between John Connally and George Bush for second place behind Ronald Reagan . For Connally has great force in his public posture but he has an organization which lacks force . Bush lacks great force in his public posture but he has an organization which possesses it . For the two of them  --  and for the American people  --  it will be a contest of vast significance : whether personal force or organizational force will prevail . In all of this there is great drama , not just for the candidates but for the American people . The elections of 1980 will be wild , wacky and meaningful . They will raise laughs and inspire groans . They will raise heroes and paint villains . They will be a passion and a recreation and they will define the state of the nation for perhaps an entire generation . A Did You Know ... ?
