But promptly at 3 p. m . Howard Goldberg of Adventures on a Shoestring and a small band of participants , clutching umbrellas and tugging at woolen hats , met at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street for a tour . Sponsoring an average of five low-cost , often unusual events in New York City each week , neither Mr. Goldberg nor his offbeat touring enterprise stops because of the weather. // ' ' Because of the rain , there ' s no charge for the tour , ' ' said Goldberg as he began to hand out discount coupons for Broadway shows to those of us who wanted them . Elegantly attired in a gray pin-stripe suit , he had already hosted two other Shoestring events earlier in the day  --  a lavish brunch at the United Nations Plaza Hotel and then attendance at the George Abbott-George S. Kaufman play ' ' Three Men on a Horse. ' ' // Although a walking tour of Greenwich Village is hardly an unusual New York event , we soon learned that one conducted by Mr. Goldberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address where Jennie Jerome , the mother of Winston Churchill , attended finishing school , we headed down the charming block of small town houses called Washington Mews. // ' ' This is one of seven privately owned streets in New York , streets that are a world within a world , ' ' said Goldberg , who then attempted to do what he does on most walking tours  --  engage passers-by in conversation about their neighborhood. // ' ' Excuse me , are you from the mews ? ' ' he asked a group of young men heading our way . As it turned out , not only were they not from the mews , but they were lost . After they were given directions , we headed to Washington Square . Here we observed a row of brick town houses facing the square , elegant structures that were being extensively renovated within . Eleanor Roosevelt , Goldberg told us , had once been the occupant of No. 29. // As he does on many of his neighborhood walking tours , Goldberg had arranged for the group to chat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was with the Rev. Charles Zanoni , pastor of Our Lady of Pompei Church on Carmine and Bleecker Streets. // Our group happily left the bleak outdoors for the sanctuary of the beautiful Italian Renaissance-style church , built in 1926 . After drawing our attention to such details as the Romanesque ceiling and exquisite gold-leafed panels behind the altar , Fr . Zanoni explained that the church was named after the area in Italy from where many of the original parishioners had emigrated. // What followed was an informative half-hour discussion in which we learned a good deal about the strong Italian community that still exists in the village despite decades of rising rents and a constantly changing ethnic and social milieu . By the time the conversation was over , we also knew where to buy good cannoli , what restaurant served especially good northern Italian dishes , and what famous people lived nearby . As we left the church and went our separate ways , it was evident that despite the rain and cold the tour proved an unexpected delight. // Howard Goldberg has been providing such delights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' It all began because I wanted to take a tour of the New York Herald Tribune , ' ' he said in an interview after the tour . ' ' I was told that I had to get together at least 15 people in order to be given a tour . So I put an ad in the Village Voice , not expecting much of a response . To my surprise , 65 people responded and 35 of them showed up for the tour . We were there at press time and were all quite thrilled to get a copy of the paper just as it rolled off the press. ' ' // The tour went so well that several of the participants suggested that he organize similar events on a permanent basis . Mostly through word of mouth , Adventures on a Shoestring has grown to include over 1 , 800 members in 25 states . Members pay $30 a year in dues and a $3 attendance fee for most events . Some events are open to nonmembers at an average price of $4 , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional fee. // The events members can participate in are limited only by the telephone directory and the imagination . Besides the Herald Tribune , Goldberg has organized tours to a yogurt factory , a fortune cookie factory , the Fashion Design Laboratory , a subway training school for motormen and conductors , the oldest Chinese department store in the United States , and an automobile assembly plant . Group lessons and demonstrations of such skills as flamenco dancing , Indonesian cooking , and Japanese sword fighting have also been set up. // Most Shoestring events are as constantly changing as the city itself , but a few particularly popular ones , such as a helicopter ride over midtown Manhattan and a backstage tour of the Metropolitan Opera House , are repeated every year . ' ' I ' m also a big one for birthdays and anniversaries , ' ' Goldberg said . ' ' We walk across the Brooklyn Bridge each year on the anniversary of its completion . And when the George Washington Bridge turned 25 last year , we walked across that , too. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also events in which Shoestring members frequently take part . Needlepoint expert Erica Wilson , Malcolm Forbes of Forbes magazine , a Broadway playwright , and a casting agent for TV commercials have been among those on hand for lively discussions. // ' ' Talking with the people who live there is the best way to get to know a neighborhood , ' ' Goldberg said . ' ' They ' ll tell you about their lives , their friends ' lives , where the best shops and restaurants are . If you want to find out what ' s really going on in some part of the city , don ' t check a bulletin board or guidebook . Ask the people in the neighborhood. ' ' // Or , it could be advised , ask Howard Goldberg. // // More information about Adventures on a Shoestring is available from 300 West 53rd Street , New York , N.Y. 10019 .
