Hope and resignation . Like oil and water , they do not mix well , yet those are the conflicting emotions that course through East Germany now that the Wall has come down . More of the former perhaps than the latter , as this artificially created country longs for a fresh start after 40 years of orthodox Communist rule , as it yearns for free , multi-party elections and economic rebirth . <P> The shock of Nov. 9 , the day an embattled East German government allowed its people to cross their borders for at least a glimpse of the outside world , has yet to wear off . Those among the nearly 5 million people who , in little more than a week , made the journey can not quite believe they did , and the faces of the thousands who pour through frontier crossings every day are bright with expectation . In Berlin , East Germans huddle over subway maps as they head into Western terra incognita , a place most of them know only from television ; at other checkpoints their cars pile up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , East Germans now face an array of questions that seemed theoretical , if not downright irrelevant , only weeks ago . Do they want to build the future within the boundaries of the state as it presently exists ? Would they be better off if the whole country were , in effect , annexed by Bonn ? Could they hold their own in a partnership with West Germany ? And perhaps most important , what are they  --  East Germans or just Germans ? <P> The euphoria of the moment has not removed all the reminders of how it was until very recently . On the route to Friedrichstrasse , a main Berlin crossing point , the subway train glides through two empty stations bricked up since 1961 , when the Wall rose . The platforms are bare , eerily lighted by a few dusty neon tubes . East German border guards have learned to replace their studied sullenness of old with the occasional smile , but West Germans and others still must file through cattle-chute-like passport control points , and are made to exchange 25 deutsche marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurious rate of 1 to 1 , one-tenth the black market quote , for every day they spend in the German Democratic Republic . In the evenings , the smell of coal smoke hangs over gray , dilapidated cities  --  as it did in the bitter days right after World War II . <P> What East Germans expect first of all from their new leaders is an effort to build " real Socialism " and sweep away the remnants of a corrupt and repressive regime . They want closer relations with their West German brethren , a growing together with the Federal Republic  --  but not necessarily reunification ; they insist on being accepted as they are . And finally , they demand economic reward , even though they know they are not likely to catch up with the West any time soon . <P> Still , the issue of identity nags : Is the G.D.R . a nation , a state , part of a country yet to be unified ? " For 40 years we were just letters , " says Christian Fuhrer , pastor of Leipzig 's Nikolai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic . Just letters . We are Germans , certainly . But our German history is submerged : 1917 is when it begins for our students . The people must develop an identity . Only then can we discuss reunification . "
