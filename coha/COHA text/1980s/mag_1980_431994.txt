 | When Clyfford Still died last week at the age of 75 , he seemed to take the heart of recent American art history with him . Most observers grouped this tall , proud man with the great painters who pioneered the revolutionary abstract expressionist style in the 1940s and ' 50s ? Jackson Pollock , Mark Rothko , Barnett Newman and the last towering survivor , Willem de Kooning . In fact , Still was not like any of them ? as thinker or personality . As a painter , he shared only the most superficial traits of the " ab-ex " style . Yes , he made huge , fiercely physical canvases covered with layers of oil paint , roughly applied . But his jagged , vertical waves of color are entirely unique , as is the puritanical , messianic fervor that inspired them . Unlike his more worldly colleagues , he detested the critics and dealers who gave him his start , the " gas-chambet white walls " of the galleries he showed in , and the public itself . " I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a NEWSWEEK critic in 1969 . A North Dakotan by birth , Still lived and thrived in New York until 1961 , when he renounced the art world and moved to a farm near Baltimore , Md . There he worked and hoarded his paintings , releasing them only now and then for exhibitions in major museums . No catalog could be published without his participation . When the Metropolitan Museum gave him an immense retrospective in New York last fall , he filled the catalog with early letters , notes and favorable reviews . Why ? Because people who love paintings , he said , also " like to know something about the individuals who make them . " But the individual who revealed himself in those pages was difficult to like or to understand . He railed against the " self-appointed spokesmen and self-styled intellectuals " who praised art or artists Still did n't like . He modestly reported that his early shows had " made it clear that a single stroke of paint . . . could restore to man the freedom lost in twenty centuries of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of all Mark Rothko , who helped him find a dealer in 1946 : Still quotes a " confession " by Rothko that he did so out of self-interest . No wonder that Still became a controversial subject late in his life . ( A " self-righteous curmudgeon , " one critic called him . ) Frontiersman : But the late critic Thomas B. Hess , one of abstract expressionism 's early defenders , saw the important link between this raw , outraged personality and his glorious paintings . Still was simply the latest , most flamboyant member of a grand American tradition , said Hess ? the pureeyed Western frontiersman outraged by city wickedness , returning to the " romanticism of man in the wilderness . " Certainly , Still intended the vast waves of color in his paintings to carry a moral force . Right or wrong , they roll radiantly across acres and acres of canvas , drenching the eyes , minds and senses of the public ? which came to love and cherish his work , if not his personality . The huge oil painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with two of his favorite colors , a deep red background bearing a torrent of rich black strokes . In its center is a thin sliver of pure , radiant white . This juxtaposition of dark and light , cynicism and innocence , exactly captures the double-edged character of this uncompromising visionary .
