But behind a chorus for equal or better treatment , many officials in Buenos Aires , Brasilia and Caracas increasingly admit that the need for relief begins at home . They know that the investment climate in their countries must improve greatly before their economies can improve , debt relief or no debt relief. // " Capital only returns when it has an answer to three questions : How much am I going to earn , when am I going to earn and in what currency am I going to earn ? " said Fernando Collor de Mello , the frontrunner in Brazil ' s Nov. 15 presidential race. // In recent weeks , new governments in Argentina and Venezuela have taken dramatic steps to lure home some of the billions of dollars their citizens have deposited in overseas banks . In Brazil , Mr. Collor , who has a strong lead in public opinion polls. has advoated improving Brazil ' s investment climate to reverse capital flight. // In July , Mexico won roughly a 35 percent reduction on the commercial portion - $54 billion - of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win debt reduction under a plan loosely formulated earlier this year by Nicholas F. Brady , the United States Treasury Secretary. // Noting " the special relationship " between Mexico and the United States , many economists and politicians interviewed in the region criticized the reduction as small. // " Mexico , with all the strength of its reform program , with the help of its largest creditor , look at what it got , " Mailson da Nobrega , Brazil ' s Finance Minister , said in an interview in Brasilia recently. // In Venezuela , Teodoro Petkoff , a deputy for a left-wing party , Movement Toward Socialism , said , " Mexico is a privileged case for the United States - and it gets stingy treatment. " // Argentina ' s president , Carlos Saul Menem , and Venezuela ' s president , Carlos Andres Perez , have asked for 50 percent reductions in their commercial debts. // But South America ' s hopes for more generous treatment than Mexico looked dim after a trio of Americans separately toured the continent this month. // Asked in Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of Citicorp , replied , " That was for Mexico , and I don ' t believe there exists an opportunity for it to be repeated elsewhere. " // Mr. Reed , whose bank is Brazil ' s largest commercial creditor , added , " Developing nations should use their own resources for promoting growth. " // In Venezuela , Senator Richard Lugar , Republican of Indiana and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee , described as unlikely " Venezuela ' s fixation of demanding a 50 percent writeoff. " // And in Argentina , David C. Mulford , United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , said , " If Argentina implements the right policies , opens its economy , privatizes and makes tax reforms , it certainly will be a candidate for the Brady initiative. " // To be sure , outside aid could help provide much-needed financial stability , so Latin American leaders are standing fast by their demands for debt relief . Some economists note recent reports that Mexico ' s economic liberalization program has brought home $1. 5 billion in flight capital - money invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home - since late June . Elsewhere in Latin America , much effort also seems directed at luring back capital . Venezuela ' s Market Is Disrupted In the presidential palace in Caracas , Mr. Perez said in an interview : " Our overseas capital will only come back when there are stable economic conditions which give confidence - and this is precisely what we want to create. " // For years , negative domestic interest rates and an artificially strong local currency , the bolivar , motivated Venezuelans to ship their money overseas . The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company estimates that Venezuelans have $58 billion in foreign banks. // Since taking office six months ago , Mr. Perez freed interest rates and abandoned fixed exchange rates , allowing the bolivar to lose almost two-thirds of its purchasing power against the dollar. // Venezuela has reduced the number of taxable and banned import items from 6 , 154 to about 200 . It has also established a schedule to reduce import tariffs from a high of 932 percent six months ago to 20 percent in 1993. // Mr. Perez also cut Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sold to the private sector. // Reeling from this free-market shock , unemployment is rising , the economy is expected to contract by 8 percent this year and inflation is forecast to hit 84 percent for the year . In February , the austerity moves provoked riots that caused 300 deaths . And in May , Venezuelans went out on their first national strike in 30 years. // " We are between a sword and the wall , " said one shantytown dweller , a 33-year-old mother of three whose husband is unemployed. // But at the palace , the President vowed , " The measures we are taking are definitive - there will be no turning back. " // In the wake of the riots , the World Bank has lent Venezuela $755 million and the International Monetary Fund has lent $4. 3 billion . Venezuela may use as much as 25 percent of the I.M.F. money to repurchase debt on the secondary market. // In negotiating debt relief with creditor banks this fall , Venezuela may be hindered by its traditional image as a model debtor . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil producer , had repaid more principal to foreign private banks than any other Latin country since the debt crisis began in 1982 . In the last five years , it paid $29 billion . Venezuela ' s commercial debt is $29 billion out of a total debt of $35 billion. // " The banks may be harder on us because they realize our situation is not such a bad case , " said Andres Duarte Vivas , a Venezuelan businessman. // In a warning to the banks , Mr. Perez said that for his liberalization program to succeed , " it is indispensable that we solve the debt problem and that we have flows of fresh money . " Argentina : Climate For Investment On Aug. 17 , the Congress in Argentina , a nation also committed to a dual strategy of seeking debt relief and improving investment conditions , passed a law to privatize 30 large state-owned companies partially or completely. // In coming weeks , the Congress is to debate a law that would protect dollar deposits in Argentina . In many Latin American countries , like Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public notice , forcing depositors to receive payment in local currency. // A law protecting dollar depositors would help bring home some of the estimated $46 billion that Argentines keep in overseas bank accounts. // " Menem ' s convinced that he has to have the right rules and environment to attract investment , " an American banker in Buenos Aires said in a telephone interview. // In two weeks , Argentine officials are to start negotiating with the I.M.F. to obtain a $1. 5 billion standby loan . Since April 1988 , Argentina has met only a small fraction of its debt payments . Today , out of a total backlog of $4. 4 billion , the I.M.F. is owed $620 million . About half of Argentina ' s $60 billion foreign debt is owed private banks. // " To get on the Brady list you are going to have to have performance under the I.M.F. program , " the American banker said . Brazil ' s Debt An Election Issue Of Latin America ' s top four debtors , Brazil seems the most distant from winning relief. // Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of Congress and , consequently , of his budget . With inflation soaring at almost 30 percent a month and the budget deficit widening , the nation has fallen out of compliance with an I.M.F. program signed last year. // For the last three months , Mr. Collor , who calls himself a " free market , free enterprise " candidate , has maintained a lead of 25 percentage points over his closest rival , a socialist , in the polls. // Next month , Mr. Collor is to travel to New York to discuss with bankers his program for debt relief for the 1990 ' s . Brazil , the developing world ' s largets debtor , owes $124 billion. // Although a Brazilian delegation had been in Washington until recently , prospects seem poor for a new , short-term agreement with the I.M.F. To keep the economy moderately stable during the election period , Brazil is slowing payments to foreign creditors in a strategy known here as " negotiated lateness " or " white moratorium. " // Exports through the end of July reached a record $20 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make $2. 3 billion in payments to private banks that come due in mid-September . Brazil has blocked payment of $1 billion in foreign obligations to keep reserves above $6 billion. // Although only two presidential candidates call for stopping debt payments , there are signs that the debt will become a volatile issue in the presidential race. // On Aug. 16 , a congressional committee voted to send to the full Congress a bill that would suspend foreign debt payments until Brazil ' s Supreme Federal Court rules on the constitutionality of the loan agreements. // " Last year we had a $19 billion trade surplus - the third largest in the world , " Fernando Gasparian , a member of the committee , said recently . " Yet 40 percent of what we earned went to pay the debt . We can ' t only be working to pay the debt. " // Mr. Collor said : " We are coming out of a decade with negative capital flows . In 1980 we owed $53 billion . From then until now we have paid $105 billion in interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his debt-reduction plan calls for stretching out debt payments over 40 years at fixed interest rates . " There is no way things can continue the way they are going , " he said. //
