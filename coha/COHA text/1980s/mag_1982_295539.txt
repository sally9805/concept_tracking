Divorce Pulitzer-style : the wild side of high society <P> Florida has plenty of small towns , but one is famous above all the rest : Palm Beach ( pop . 9,700 ) is a plush , pastel resort for the very rich . Florida also has plenty of divorces : 75,000 last year , more than any other state but California and Texas . But the divorce trial under way at the Palm Beach County courthouse has , like the town , achieved an overcharged notoriety . For starters there is a prize surname : Herbert ( " Peter " ) Pulitzer Jr. , 52 , who filed suit to dissolve his six-year marriage to the former Roxanne Dixon , nee Ulrich . Peter is one of Newspaper Publisher Joseph Pulitzer 's flock of grandchildren . He has money and local roots old and deep enough to prompt invitations to the oligarchs ' parties and all the charity balls . Then there are the grounds for the divorce action . So far Pulitzer or his witnesses have testified that Roxanne , 31 , went to bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Belgian race-car driver , the beautiful young wife of a handsome old Kleenex heir , an alleged drug dealer and a supernatural trumpet . That 's right , trumpet . There are charges of drug use . And menages a trois . And incest . And death threats . " It does n't sound very American or normal , " admits a rich young acquaintance of the Pulitzers , a Palm Beach resident for more than 20 years . " But it 's Palm Beach . Palm Beach is not very normal in itself . " <P> Indeed not , but the Pulitzers at least seem to be fighting over the customary prerogatives : money and child custody . Roxanne , who was unemployed and living in a mobile home before she met Peter in 1974 , wants a good chunk of his fortune ( he owns citrus groves and hotels ) . He says he has only $2.5 million ; she reckons it to be $25 million . Just her basic living expenses , she claims , will amount to some $246,000 a year . Some prominent items : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clothes , another $18,000 to dress Twins Maclean and Zachary , 5 , and $3,000 to buy the birthday presents " Mack " and " Zack " are obliged to give their Palm Beach playmates . Peter Pulitzer , athletic and severely good-looking , hopes to convince Circuit Court Judge Carl Harper that Roxanne is a wastrel unfit to raise the boys . <P> Dad does not claim to be unswervingly wholesome . He admits that he sometimes joined his wife in the use of cocaine . He denies , however , her charge that he once flew a load of marijuana from the Bahamas to Florida on board his plane . He also said in pretrial testimony that twice he joined in a drugs-and-sex frolic with Roxanne and Jacqueline Kimberly , 32 , the third wife of James Kimberly , 76 , an heir to the papermaking Kimberly-Clark fortune . But most of the time , according to Peter , his wife and Mrs. Kimberly carried on their love affair without him . Roxanne claims that two years ago , Peter gave Jacquie a gift-wrapped ounce of cocaine ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposition Peter denied it and suggested that Roxanne was the source of the coke .
