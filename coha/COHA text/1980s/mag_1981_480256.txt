AFTER SEVERAL decades of uncertain purpose , the navy has finally discovered a rationale for unlimited expansion : the protection of imported raw materials . For most of the nuclear age , the navy sailed about aimlessly while the air force built up its arsenal of missiles and the army enlarged its presence in NATO ; now , as a result of the energy crisis and growing U.S. dependence on imported minerals , the navy has acquired new prominence as guardian of the world 's trade routes . " These sea lanes , " a navy publicist observed recently , " are the Life Lines of America . " carrying the essential raw materials needed to sustain " our highvelocity Twentieth Century industrial system . " Of these " lifelines , " none is more critical than the oil route extending outward from the Persian Gulf , and it is here that the navy has amassed its largest fleet since the heyday of Michael T. Klare is a fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington , D.C. , and author of a forthcoming book on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has demonstrated how this force can protect U3. imports if the oil fields are in flames , the navy is already planning similar forces along all other sea routes used to transport vital raw materials . The protection of imported commodities is not , of course , an entirely new rationale for naval expansion . During the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries , such concerns were often used to justify the construction of large naval forces . After World War II , however , the materials issue was overshadowed by the Soviet nuclear buildup and the emerging threat to NATO . For a time . U.S. strategists questioned whether we even needed a navy , save as an escort service for Europe-bound supply ships . But then came the Arab oil embargo of 1974 , and the protection of imported materials again became a strategic priority . With the fall of the Shah , moreover , America was left without a reliable ally in the Persian Gulf area , forcing Washington to assume direct responsibility for the protection of Mideast oil . Andbecause the navy , alone of U.S. military services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of force in the Gulf , it was able to assume responsibility for the defense of oil supplies from that region . As one crisis has followed another in the Persian Gulf area , the navy has steadily expanded its presence in adjacent waters . Originally , this presence was limited to the two destroyers of the Bahrain-based Middle East Force ; since the fall of the Shah , however . the Indian Ocean has been crisscrossed by a steady convoy of aircraft carriers along with a large supporting cast of submarines , escorts , supply ships . and tankers . At the present time , there are two large carrier task groups in the region , and the navy is talking of deploying a permanent " Fifth Fleet " in the Indian Ocean . And if , as appears increasingly likely , the United States moves to protect oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. it will he the navy that will execute the maneuvers involved . F LUSHES WITH success over its capturing of responsibility for the protection of foreign oil , the navy has mapped out plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral imports . Because America 's high-technology industries are so dependent on scarce materials like titanium and cobalt , and because many of these substances are concentrated in volatile areas of the Third World , Pentagon officials are increasingly warning of mineral shortages in the same apocalyptic terms they once used to describe the energy crisis . " Should we become isolated from the rest of the world and our stockpile of raw materials become depleted , " the navy warned recently , " the operations of our basic industries would be sharply curtailed , " with a consequent decline in our ability " to achieve our national objectives in time of war , and to support our way of life in time of peace . " Given this danger , the United States must , in the view of many prominent strategists , establish a global picket force of the sort already deployed in the Indian Ocean . " One can only conclude , " former NATO commander Gen. Alexander M. Haig ( and possible Defense Secretary under President Reagan ) testified recently " that the era of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic minerals is an attractive rationale for expanded military activity for several reasons . First , of course , the public is already persuaded of the need to protect imported petroleum and so should be primed to accept any similar steps taken in defense of imported minerals . Second , mineral deposits are scattered all across the globe . and thus a strategy to protect minerals would require an even bigger expansion of military capabilities than that required for protection of Persian Gulf oil . ( The Pentagon has estimated . for instance , that it will cost us $5 billion annually to protect the oil flow , so it is reasonable to assume that defense of mineral supplies in Africa , Latin America , and the southwestern Pacific could cost another $10 to $15 billion per year . ) More important , perhaps , is that many Americans are worried that materials shortages ? combined with what is perceived as growing instability in Third World areas ? will produce a decline in U.S. living standards , and so presumably they would be inclined to support a military posture stressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ econocentric defense posture of just this sort was unveiled by Defense Secretary Harold Brown in his report on the fiscal 1981 defense budget . " The particular manner in which our economy has expanded , " he explained , " means that we have come to depend to no small degree on imports , exports , and the earnings from overseas investments for our material well-being . " Because these interests are threatened by what he termed " international turbulence " ? meaning social , political , and economic unrest in the Third World ? America must be prepared to use force where needed to protect its overseas commerce . " In a world of disputes and violence , " he declared , " we can not afford to go abroad unarmed . " w RILE ALL four military services are likely to benefit from the new emphasis on imported materials , the navy is expected to reap the lion 's share of any new Congressional largesse . The navy 's preeminent position is based on a number of basic propositions : ? Mineral deposits are scattered all across the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to protect all of these far-flung resources simultaneously . Because U.S. geopolitical interests " span continents and the interconnecting oceans , " Chief of Naval Operations Adm . Thomas B. Hayward affirmed , " It is critical that we maintain the kind of navy that can go anywhere . and stay as long as necessary , to support our military aims in war and our national policies in peace . " ? Most imported raw materials must travel by ship , and the navy is the acknowledged guardian of the world 's sea lanes . The flow of raw materials . Adm . Isaac C. Kidd , Jr. , argued recently , " must not stop . It moves by ship . Ships are of the sea . This is a matter for our navy . " ? The most powerful instrument of Soviet influence in the Third World is the Russian navy , and thus we must expand our own navy if we are to ensure the continued freedom of the seas . " The Soviet geopolitical offensive , " Admiral Hayward observed , " has a strong maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity " to interfere with the world 's ocean-borne commerce . " Impelled by these arguments , Congress has demanded a rapid buildup in naval forces , and particularly of surface warships of the type used to patrol oceanic trade routes . So adamant is Congress on this issue that it has repeatedly funded more ships than the Pentagon itself has asked for . Thus , when Secretary Brown requested $6 billion to build fifteen new warships in 1979 , Congress appropriated several billion more to produce four additional ships ( two submarines and two guided-missile frigates ) and to purchase four Spruance-class destroyers originally built for Iran and later rejected by the new Islamic regime . And when , in 1980 , Brown announced a fiscal-year 1981 plan for seventeen new ships , the House Armed Services Committee recommended an addition of still another four ships . The new Congressional emphasis on naval shipbuilding will have an even greater impact on the Pentagon 's future programs . In 1979 , when Brown unveiled a five-year , $40-billion plan to construct sixty-seven new warships by 1984 , many lawmakers charged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So persistent were the plan 's critics that the administration came back one year later with a new five-year plan totaling ninety-seven ships ? a 45-percent increase over the earlier plan . T HE NAVAL buildup , and other military programs favored by the Department of Defense , are sure to be accelerated as the concern over imported minerals intensifies . These efforts , costing U.S. taxpayers many billions of dollars per year in increased military outlays , are being described as a necessary response to the threat of mineral cutoffs . If we examine the materials issue closely , however , we find that the situation is not as grave as that described by Pen-tagon analysts in defending their requests for higher military spending . Nor is military action the most effective response to any such problems as may arise . To begin with , the United States has large reserves of a great many essential minerals . For many of the basic industrial materials ? copper , iron . lead , gypsum ? U.S. sources provide most or all of domestic needs and even , in some cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of State , the United States imports about $4 billion worth of minerals per year while exporting $3 billion worth . ) Nevertheless , the nation must turn to foreign suppliers for some critical materials not found or not produced here . These materials are not always consumed in large quantity , but because they are needed to produce exotic alloys and other specialty products , they are considered vital to America 's high-technology industries . Fortunately , many of the most critical minerals not produced here can be obtained from Canada , Mexico , Australia , or other countries with close ties to the United States . Canada , for instance , is a major source of copper , nickel , and zinc , while Australia supplies much of the ore used in making titanium . But many other essential materials can only be obtained from Third World countries where political turbulence or military conflict could threaten U.S. supplies . War-torn Zaire , for instance , supplies 34 percent of U.S. cobalt needs , while Malaysia provides 47 percent of our tin and Jamaica 50 percent of our bauxite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstable , Air Force magazine warned recently that " neither the United States nor its allies can be assured of the long-term availability of minerals from these nations . " And because alternative sources would take years to develop , any interruption in these supplies could , according to Sen. Howard H. Cannon of Nevada , " severely threaten national economic security , disrupt industrial production , and threaten the meeting of other national needs . " To prevent such a catastrophe , the Pentagon would have the United States spend billions of dollars a year to protect key trade routes and to develop " rapiddeployment forces " for intervention abroad . But while such moves appear to provide some security against potential shortages , they are neither the only nor necessarily the best response to future cutoffs . As a hedge against temporary shortages , the United States can add to its materials stockpiles ? a $14-billion storehouse of essential commodities established in 1946 to supply U.S. industries in the event of another global war . ( In 1980 the Carter administration requested $170 million to expand the stockpile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis , slashed the request to $100 million . ) To safeguard against longer-term cutoffs , we can begin developing substitute materials ? many exotic alloys , for instance , can be replaced with " composite " products made from common metals and advanced ceramics ? while simultaneously stepping up conservation and reclamation efforts . T HE SUREST way to reduce U.S. dependency on precarious foreign sources is to eliminate that dependency altogether by developing alternative supplies . Many of the materials now imported from turbulent areas of the world are also found in other regions , although usually in less concentrated form ; by employing new mining and smelting techniques , however , it should be possible to produce adequate supplies from such sources . Thus , while the United States presently imports most of its chromium from Zimbabwe and South Africa , development of the very large reserves of low-grade ores found at home and in Canada can compensate for the loss of these supplies . True , ventures of this sort will be costly and involve some risk for the mining firms involved , but the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort in the energy field , and it is obvious that even the enormous expense involved will not begin to approach the cost of an unlimited naval buildup or a prolonged resource war in the Third World . Admittedly , the development of new sources of minerals at home and abroad will not , in all cases , assure the United States of immunity from future cutoffs of critical raw materials . Future upheavals , like the present conflict between Iran and Iraq , may temporarily curtail our access to some materials . It is in such cases that Pentagon strategists talk of using military force in defense of U.S. supplies . But no one has indicated what form such action would take or how it would actually result in the . resumption of deliveries . Before we rush into any such adventures , therefore , it is essential to ask what , if any , benefit may result from military action . Surely , if the current Iraqi-Iranian conflict has anything to tell us , it is of the near impossibility of protecting resource flows through military means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installations of both countries sustained damage that will take years to repair . At this point , no one can predict when those two countries will again be able to ship any substantial quantities of oil to customers abroad . If the fighting should spread , moreover , there is little , if anything , that the United States can do to ensure the survival of other Gulf oil facilities . A U.S. naval squadron in the Strait of Hormuz may satisfy the need to " do something , " but it will have little meaning if the oil fields themselves are destroyed . And if U.S. forces are deployed in any kind of strength , the country may find itself in an expand . ing conflagration that will consume more fuel than will ever reach its shores from that area . True , mineral supplies are not as combustible as oil wells . But smelters and ore-loading facilities are just as vulnerable as refineries and just as difficult to replace . More important , soldiers do not miners make , and there is no way to coax ores out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike or , more likely , up in the hills hiding from our troops . In sum , there is little the navy or marines can do to restore production even if they succeed in occupying the minefields . It appears obvious that military action is no solution to the problem of insecure mineral supplies . As in the case of U.S. energy needs , the more economical and prudent course would be to lessen our dependency on imported materials rather than to permit such dependencies to draw us into a catastrophic " resources war . " Arid , having adopted this approach , we will discover that the materials problem is not as precarious as Pentagon officials ? for their own , essentially parochial , reasons ? would have us believe . " As long as we keep up our science and technology , " the director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines , Dr. John Morgan , observed recently , " the world has more resources now than ever , and there will be even more in the future . Given relative peace in the world , reasonable price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not going to run out of anything . "
