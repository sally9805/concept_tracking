Mr. Smith , in short , has cast himself as a nation ' s conscience. // The Windhoek Observer , now six years old , is one of southern Africa ' s most talked-about and irreverent publications . Each week , for instance , it carries a full-page picture of a seminude woman , challenging the morality laws that extend from South Africa to this territory under its domination. // Its editorials rail against Pretoria ' s occupation of South-West Africa , which the United Nations calls illegal , and against what Mr. Smith calls the duplicity and double lives led by prominent figures in the territory. // The paper is locked in a running battle with the Dutch Reformed Church , the institution that provides the theological spine of Afrikanerdom and the scriptural justification for the policies of racial separation . Its accusations are sweeping , attributed to ambiguously described sources and laden with innuendo . Mr. Smith says it reflects a white society that lives what he calls a " pious lie " in a city with the population - and the proclivities - of Peyton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith has been active as a journalist in South-West Africa for 27 years . His father made a living hauling ox wagons for the Imperial German colonizers who survived here until 1915 . His mother belonged to the Afrikaner pioneers who pushed northward , deep into Angola. // At the age of 51 , he is a man much tormented with visions of his nation and its people that verge on the apocalyptic . The language of his anguish is Old Testament rather than New , laced , nonetheless , with intimations of lust. // Of South Africa ' s domination of South-West Africa , widely known as Namibia , he said in an interview : " We are like the little stepdaughter that comes into the house and is told by the stepfather to wash the dishes , and is told how dependent she is . But then , at night , she is raped , night after night . " Mr. Smith is a fervent Namibian nationalist , seeking a single nation " under one flag " without South African rule. // On what he calls the duplicitous lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day they are upholders of morality . At night they appear in the devil ' s attire . " It is a world , it seems , with no grayness between sunlight and satanic night. // If the Dutch Reformed Church moves against him , he said in an interview at the white-painted bungalow here that is the headquarters of The Windhoek Observer , " I have told them that I will start a series on the nocturnal lives of certain top office-bearers . " In his columns , he has been more direct , speaking of church elders " having nicknames as a result of their sex escapades with women , in some cases little black girls aged 10 to 12 . " <> <> Paper Is Widely Read // In the world of the Dutch Reformed Church here , with its rebuttal of miscegenation and insistence on a messianic role for white morality , that ' s fighting talk . And in Windhoek ' s small world , among a population of only 90 , 000 , it spells trouble . Mr. Smith compares his relationship with the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleading with him not to kill you. " // With a print run of between 8 , 500 and 11 , 000 a week , The Observer may seem small , but only in circlation . It is probably the most widely read newspaper in the land , and , to outsiders at least , its idiosyncratic style provides a not-to-be-missed break from the slavish loyalty displayed by some , but not all , Windhoek newspapers to various party lines. // In a recent issue , for instance , Mr. Smith printed , in full , the United States State Department report on human rights in South-West Africa . He highlighted , on the front page , an article on a purported party at which senior military officials entertained the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi , used a military aircraft to fly in more liquor and decorated the table with about $15 , 000 worth of Krugerrand gold coins. // The newspaper , much of which is written by Mr. Smith himself , then went on to question the probity of a Windhoek city councilor . On page 52 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an unidentified woman wearing only the lower part of a leopard- skin bikini . Such brazenness is unrivaled in the southern African press . <> <> ' I Am Going It Alone ' // The newspaper also reported fully on Mr. Smith ' s withdrawal from the National Press Union , an umbrella organization of newspaper proprietors . " I am going it alone , for such is my fate , " Mr. Smith wrote . " What is left for me before I enter the incinerator of the Windhoek Crematorium ? Quite simple . To stand up in defense of the truth , and to resist to the last day of my sublunary existence the rot that is the practice in my country. " // His editorial , then , revolved around a favored theme : South Africa ' s " plundering " of South-West Africa ' s resources , and what Mr. Smith sees as the hypocrisy of Pretoria ' s claim to be a defender of this country against Communist advance. // " You are hailed as a fighter against the Red Peril when you have stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who live in oppression in a system that is so criminal that it does not even provide a man with the basics which the country of his birth owes him - schooling , a job and something to eat. " // Mr. Smith does not think such broadsides guarantee his newspaper much by way of longevity . He has just received , he said , an order to register with the authorities that could be the precursor of the newspaper ' s demise. // His newspaper , he said , " came into this world not in the garment of the newly born . " " It came in the garment of death " because , he said , of its opposition to South Africa ' s rule here . " How far can a man maneuver before he is outmaneuvered ? " <> <> A Passion for His Work // He is a man , it seems , seized with passions for his work . He drives 5 , 000 to 6 , 000 miles a month in quest of stories and disclosures , noting where government trucks are heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned mine inhabited by poverty- stricken people who eke a living from the last scratches of minerals left there. // The twin windmills against which he tilts are South Africa ' s domination and what he says are the moral double- standards among people in office . And that poses questions , for the crusader , after all , should not be given to the same mendacity as his victims. // So his confession is public . " I like women , " he said , " I like nice girls and nice women and I will like them to the last days of my life . " No coyness there , in other words , no conflict of interest . He even speaks up in favor of the establishment of a " proper house of pleasure " here. // But what of those of his victims who he says have taken their lives rather than face the opprobrium of publicity in the pages of The Windhoek Observer , serving a community so small and interlocked that names do not need to be named for identities to be established ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smith said in the interview , " and I ' m not unhappy about it because they did nothing to help my country.
