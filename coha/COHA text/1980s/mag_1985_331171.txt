It was 3:30 a.m. in Jerusalem when Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres was awakened by a telephone call from California . For the next hour he and U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz discussed how to extricate the Israeli government from an ever thickening diplomatic quagmire . For ten days the Peres Cabinet had sidestepped the implications of the arrest in Washington of Jonathan Pollard , a Navy counterintelligence analyst , on charges of selling top-secret information to Israel . Even as details of Peres ' internal investigation of the affair began leaking to the press , the Prime Minister stubbornly refused to comment on the case . When Shultz placed his call to Peres , the Reagan Administration was impatient for at least some sign of progress on the Pollard inquiry . It was time to confront the issue . <P> That afternoon the Prime Minister released a brief , carefully worded statement . " Spying on the United States stands in total contradiction to our policy , " it read . " Such activity , to the extent that it did take place , was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if government officials were implicated in the espionage , " those responsible will be brought to account , the unit involved . . . will be completely and permanently dismantled , and necessary organizational steps will be taken to ensure that such activities are not repeated . " <P> Still , the statement left disturbing questions unanswered . Would the U.S. be allowed to question key Israeli officials who may have dealt with Pollard ? Would Israel return intelligence documents it had obtained through him ? Who recruited Pollard ? How much , if anything , did the top men in the Israeli government know about his activities ? Peres said only that his investigation was " still incomplete , " and declared that Israel would uncover " all the facts to the last detail no matter where the trail may lead . " <P> Secretary Shultz was quick to applaud Peres ' qualified apology . " We are satisfied , " he said . Shultz later announced that a team of American investigators would travel to Israel this week to interview officials implicated in the case . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved satisfactorily , " he said . " We expect these matters to go forward expeditiously and completely . " Not everyone in the Reagan Administration was so sanguine . " The apology went a long way to meeting the concerns , " said a high-ranking Administration official , " but we await the results . " A top intelligence officer expressed skepticism of the State Department 's motives . Said he : " They are afraid of the Jewish lobby on one hand and that it might cause the downfall of Shimon Peres on the other . "
