At 16 , Darci Kistler is on point <P> There are no subtleties in Darci Kistler 's success story : she is a little girl 's fantasy come to life . At 16 she has been given major roles by George Balanchine , the greatest living choreographer . New York City Ballet audiences , normally a reserved and sophisticated lot , cheer her on to three or four bows . Alexandra Danilova , a former prima ballerina , says that Darci has " a perfume in her dancing that makes you think , ' How beautiful . ' " <P> She is a typical Balanchine dancer : lithe , leggy , fair-haired . She moves with the speed and clarity he demands . She seems to know instinctively what many talented dancers need years to learn : how to engage an audience . Even in a difficult role where rough edges show , she takes obvious pleasure in being onstage dancing . Her joy leaps right over the footlights and lets the audience share in her zest . <P> That , of course , is what show biz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without precedent : at City Ballet , Patricia McBride , Suzanne Farrell and Gelsey Kirkland all came to prominence at about her age . Still the clamor for Darci has surprised the company-which promotes its repertory rather than its stars-and Balanchine . He has forbidden interviews with her . Darci 's career is only a few months old , yet her parents are already beset by promoters who are seeking endorsements . That 's how fast a new sunbeam travels . <P> Darci took on her first major parts in Europe last summer while the company was on tour . In the current New York season , she appears in Bizet 's Symphony in C , Raymonda Variations , Valse Fantaisie , Walpurgisnacht and Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3 . Of these , the lyrical adagio in the Bizet is the most difficult , demanding regal presence and an enigmatic , almost witchy sexiness . But Darci is a very young princess , and the other quality is still beyond her . Nor did it help when , on the second night , a bodice seam split down to the waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her signature , swimming happily through the ballet 's subaqueous rhythms , and looking like what she is , a California girl transfigured . <P> Within City Ballet , Darci Kistler has been watched closely since her first school workshop performance . During rehearsals for her final student appearance in Swan Lake last May , she had a hip injury , but danced " full out " the whole time . Says a friend : " She covered the pain for two hours every afternoon . It was sheer determination . " Says Irina Kosmovska , who began teaching Darci in California when she was eleven : " Darci was a fountain of energy . She tried everything . She was one of my most intense students-she would commit suicide on the floor . "
