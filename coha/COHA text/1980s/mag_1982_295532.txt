The race is on , and the President is hard to hit <P> The campaigns for the Senate , for governorships , for seats in Congress and state legislatures are only starting to get into high gear . The results , when the votes are counted on Nov. 2 , will be distorted by thousands of considerations of personality and local concerns . But a central theme is emerging : Who is to blame for the prolonged and severe U.S. recession ? <P> It was an issue that both parties joined enthusiastically last week . President Ronald Reagan , in a televised news conference and a partisan tub-thumping blast in Virginia , at which high school bands blared and pom-pom girls paraded , sought to seize the high ground . The slump , Reagan declared , was the result of generations of misguided Democratic tax-and-spend politics . His Administration , he claimed , has already reduced inflation rates sharply and interest rates somewhat , and eventually will bring down joblessness too-if only the voters elect a friendly Congress that gives its policies time to work . The electorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demagoguery and rhetoric they are going to hear . " <P> Democrats readily accepted the challenge . The party 's national chairman , Charles Manatt , charged that Reagan had changed from the Great Communicator to " the Great Prevaricator . " Manatt protested that Reagan had made a whole string of misstatements , overstatements and highly misleading assertions . Democratic candidates everywhere bewailed the highest unemployment rate in more than 40 years and the highest bankruptcy figures in half a century . They charged that these factors constituted an unacceptable price for the drop in inflation ( from 13.5% in 1980 , the last pre-Reagan year , to an annual rate of 5.1% so far in 1982 ) . <P> The debate acquired special pungency because the week 's news indicated that the economy is still bumping along the bottom of the painful slump that began in July 1981 . The Government 's index of leading indicators , the statistics thought to foreshadow most accurately future business trends , dropped .9% in August , after four months of upticks . Reagan dismissed this in advance as " a glitch " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than a glitch . <P> More ominous , first-time claims by newly laid-off workers for unemployment compensation rose to 703,000 in the week ending Sept. 17 , the highest figure since these statistics were first compiled in 1967 . That strengthened indications that the September unemployment rate might have hit 10% for the first time since 1940 . Already , politicians in both parties are referring to Friday , when the September rate will be announced , as Double-D ( for double-digit ) Day .
