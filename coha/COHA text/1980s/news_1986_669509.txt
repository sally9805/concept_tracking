That evening I was to embark on a 13-night voyage aboard Swan Hellenic ' s MTS Orpheus , a Greek ship that would carry me to distant corners of the eastern Mediterranean . It would be a journey of historical poignancy , traversing the center of the ancient cultures that have shaped Western civilization - Greece , Egypt , and Asia Minor. // What was to distinguish this odyssey from other Mediterranean cruises was the presence of five eminent British scholars whose daily program of talks enhanced the experience . On my particular cruise , they spoke on such inviting themes as ' ' How the Heartland of Christianity Became Muslim , ' ' ' ' Ancient Mariners , ' ' and ' ' Byzantium to Istanbul . ' ' Presented in the ship ' s Lounge of the Muses - or at the sites themselves - the talks were brief but stimulating and often entertaining in unexpected ways. // // I soon realized that what takes center stage on the Swan Hellenic cruises are not glittering floor shows but the destinations themselves . It was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational cruise over 30 years ago . Today , accompanying each of its 22 different voyages , are a rotating group of scholars , senior research fellows , museum curators , and authors , whose areas of expertise coincide with the places to be visited . On full days at sea , four 30-minute talks enlivened the day . An added dimension was the availability of books from the impressive library , which could be read on one of the ship ' s decks or by the pool. // Meals aboard the Orpheus are well prepared and varied but not lavish , with open seating and a choice of either table service in the Dionysus Restaurant or buffet dining in the Jason Taverna . At lunch , passengers can opt to dine on the deck. // Our first stop was on the island of Delos which , in antiquity , had been the sacred center of the Aegean world . It was here that the cult of Apollo flourished from the beginning of the 7th century until the end of the 4th century BC . The site is a maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the hundreds of years during which Apollo held sway. // In the center of the ' ' sacred district , ' ' we saw the palm tree that , according to mythology , gave Apollo ' s mother support during childbirth . Beyond was the statue to Dionysus , Apollo ' s brother , and only a few steps away , the four marble lions of Delos appeared , valiently guarding what was once the Sacred Lake . Nearly lost in the labyrinth of fallen pillars was the pedestal that once supported the 24-foot statue of Apollo , the ancient Greeks ' god of light and beauty. // Delos also had been a thriving cosmopolitan center filled with markets , cisterns , grand colonnades , hippodromes , stadia , theaters , and opulent villas . We saw the ruins of many of these. // The island was a great trading center due to its proximity to important shipping routes from the Aegean Sea to Egypt , Asia Minor , and the entire eastern Mediterranean .

Cynthus we had an awesome view of the Aegean Sea and the encircling islands - Mykonos , Naxos , Paros , Tinos , and others. // On the following full day at sea the Swan Hellenic lecturers presented several talks in anticipation of our two-day excursion into Egypt. // We docked in Alexandria and boarded a coach for the three-hour drive to Cairo . I was struck by the decrepitude of a city that once had been the intellectual heart of the ancient world . Only when we drove along the wide arc of the city ' s harbor did I sense the mystery that had so stirred earlier visitors. // Cairo proved to be an onslaught of stimuli : sleek glass office towers next to soaring 10th-century minarets , incredibly heavy traffic running parallel to the ageless Nile , luxuriant gardens defying the encroachment of the desert . The city gave me the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have shaped it : pharaonic , Islamic , Coptic. // We spent much of the morning engrossed in the treasures of the Egyptian Museum . Through it ' s enduring art and architecture , we got a more comprehensive view of ancient Egyptian culture than of any other from antiquity . Thus , the choice of this museum as the starting point for our tour proved strategic. // In the afternoon we visited the Ibn Tulun Mosque , a building with beautiful arches and intricate latticework surrounding the sunswept courtyard , and a commanding view of Cairo from the top of its minaret . Completed in AD 879 , it is considered one of the finest examples of pure Islamic art in the world. // Later , we visited Cairo ' s opulent Citadel complex , the headquarters and official residence of the Sultans until 1850 . From an overlook near the Citadel grounds , one could see the Great Pyramids at Giza on the far horizon . But it was not until that night , at the spectacular Son et Lumiere show at Giza , that I felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled 20 miles southwest of Cairo to Saqqara , site of the famed Step Pyramid . Unlike Giza where one feels the proximity of Cairo , at Saqqara one is truly immersed in the desert . And so great is the scale of Saqqara ( containing over 14 pyramids , hundreds of tombs , art objects , and engravings ) that archaeologists estimate only about one-third of the site has been studied. // Here , where the earliest papyrus and oldest mummy were discovered , our archaeologist-guide told us the story of Imhotep who , around 2200 BC , had conceived the idea of piling six mastabas ( long , rectangular tombs ) on top of each other in diminishing size . This form , which is believed to symbolize the stairway to heaven , became the prototype for the smooth-sided Great Pyramids of Cheops ( at Giza ) some 100 years later. // Later , after visiting Memphis , Egypt ' s first capital ( 3500 BC ) , we returned to Giza to see the enigmatic Sphinx . As I looked at its human head with a lion ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , the sun began to dip behind the pyramids . I suddenly realized that my own eyes were now seeing the same forms that had once stunned the eyes of Alexander and , it is believed , Moses and St. Paul as well. // After Egypt it was on to Cyprus to see the temples , churches , and splendid ruins that recalled the island ' s occupation by 17 peoples in the course of its complex history . Then we traveled up the west coast of Turkey to find , at Troy , the expansive plain where the Homeric heroes confronted destiny ; from there we sailed through the Dardanelles and into the Sea of Marmara to arrive at Istanbul , city of Byzantine splendor . This ' ' Rome of the East ' ' ( the site of ancient Byzantium which later became Constantinople ) had been one of the world ' s greatest religious , economic , and artistic centers - from its founding by Emperor Constantine in AD 330 until the Turkish conquest in 1453 . Here , we toured the Hippodrome , the city ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suleymaniye Mosque , Hagia Sophia , the ancient walls , and finally ended the tour at Istanbul ' s vast bazaar. // The Orpheus continued on a southwesterly course to Aegina , a hospitable and joyful island crowned by the lovely 5th-century Temple of Aphaea , one of the best-preserved temples of ancient Greece. // We then sailed up the Ionian Sea to Corfu . With its lushly forested mountains framing turquoise bays and its elegant Venetian-style town , it is one of the most alluring of all the Greek islands. // Finally , the journey continued north into the Adriatic Sea and up the Dalmatian coastline of Yugoslavia . In Dubrovnik we ended our Mediterranean odyssey. // // Practical information // Swan Hellenic ' s cruises aboard the SS Orpheus encompass 14 nations , from Spain to Russia and from Morocco to Israel . Embarkation cities include Athens , Dubrovnik , Venice , Nice , and Naples ( with overnight stays in London scheduled before and after each cruise ) .
