Under a plan introduced in New York last year , the more care a Medicaid patient requires , the larger the reimbursement the nursing home receives . The result , according to state officials and nursing-home administrators , is that " light care " patients applying for admission are waiting in hospitals or at home , or otherwise falling through cracks in the health-care system. // Robert Guenther faced this problem with his 82-year-old mother , who has Alzheimer ' s disease . She could no longer remember the name of her son or grandchildren , and at one point was found wandering in a daze near her home in Westchester County . That ' s when Mr. Guenther took the step he had hoped to avoid : looking for a nursing home , visiting six in four months . The response was always the same : his mother had to wait for a bed because under the state ' s care-rating system , she was not deemed profitable. // " I sometimes got the feeling that how she rated mattered more than how she felt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McFadden , associate director of the Isabella Geriatric Center in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan , said , " Our biggest objective is to stay in business and the plain fact is , we get paid more for the heavier cases . " The Isabella center has been judged one of the best-run nursing homes in New York City by consumer and support groups in the city. // The New York plan is " a basically sound plan , but any new plan needs time , " said William J. Gormley , assistant director of the State Health Department ' s division of health care financing . " There will be adjustments made , but it ' s bad policy to change every other day , " said Mr. Gormley , who helped draw up the state ' s Medicaid reimbursement system. // The plan affects 650 nursing homes and nearly 100 , 000 patients , 85 percent of whom are covered by Medicaid . It also affects the 4 , 000 people who at any given time are trying to gain entrance to nursing homes in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-income people of all ages. // " It ' s just a matter of time before most states go this way , " said Tom Jazwiecki , director of the office of reimbursement and financing for the American Health Care Association , a nursing home industry group based in Washington . " To pay appropriate dollars for the level of care is the only sophisticated approach. " // Minnesota and Maryland already have reimbursement plans similar to New York ' s , and Texas , Colorado and Michigan are considering such plans . Most other states , including Connecticut and New Jersey , have reimbursement systems similar to New York ' s old arrangement , in which nursing homes were reimbursed by Medicaid on a per-patient basis regardless of the level of care the patient required . That arrangement , however , offered no incentive to admit the seriously ill , so the nursing homes tended to admit those who were easier to care for . <> <> Plan Was to Aid Seriously Ill // The current plan , which became effective Jan. 1 , 1986 , was created to correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified in 16 resource utilization groups , or R.U.G. ' s ; each represents a different category of care . The higher a patient ' s category , the more money the nursing home receives and may profit by , even though it might seem that the cost of caring for heavy-care patients would exceed the cost for light-care patients. // " It is not really clear that the heavy-care patients cost more to take care of , " said Jeffrey D. Ambers , the executive director of Friends and Relatives of Institutionalized Aged Inc. , a support group . " They often don ' t take physical therapy and they don ' t have to be supervised . The nursing home is often there just to maintain them. " // In New York , the average cost to a patient for nursing home care is $95 a day . For patients on Medicaid , the cost is fully reimbursed . Medicare , the Federal health insurance program for elderly and disabled Americans , generally pays only a part of nursing home costs and only for limited times. // Initially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed equitable . Most nursing home directors and consumer monitoring groups agree that it was a good idea to bring the patients most in need of care into nursing homes . But statistics suggest that the results are hardly fair . <> <> Broken Hip Made a Difference // In the last year and a half the number of Medicaid patients statewide in the heaviest-care category - heavy rehabilitation B - has tripled , to 3 , 060 from about 1 , 050 , according to Mr. Gormley of the State Health Department . The number of Medicaid patients statewide in the lightest-care category - reduced physical functioning A - has fallen to 32 , 000 from 42 , 000. // The personal histories are compelling . Selma Greenberg of Rochester said that while her mother , who has Alzheimer ' s disease , was waiting for a bed in a nursing home , she fell and broke her hip . After that , Mrs. Greenberg said : " You should have seen how quickly she was accepted . They seemed to look at her differently. " // Mr. Guenther , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , profit-seeking nursing home in upstate New York , but only after he paid a $50 , 000 entry fee . The authorities say , and Mr. Guenther conceded , that such fees are illegal. // Many private groups that monitor nursing homes and many nursing home directors say that as nursing homes have stretched to accommodate more seriously ill patients , the quality of care for all patients and the overall quality of life in the homes have declined . <> <> Other Presssures Converge // " More and more very sick people are entering the system , " said Olga Lipschitz , director of the Cobble Hill Nursing Home in Brooklyn , " and I don ' t know how much longer the system will be able to absorb them . " She also serves as a special agent for the State Department of Health ; when the department finds the quality of care in a nursing home unacceptable , Mrs. Lipschitz is sent in as temporary administrator. // Other pressures have converged on the system , including the method by which Medicare reimburses hospitals in New York State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1986 , the faster a Medicare patient leaves a hospital , the more money the hospital receives . Medicare often stops paying as soon as a patient stops needing acute care . Long hospital stays are thus discouraged. // The result , Mr. Ambers said , is that patients or their families are often forced to hurry their search for a nursing home , or the hospitals will place a patient in the first available nursing home , which might not be the most suitable for the patient . In either case , the nursing home often plays backup to the hospital. // The Isabella center , a nonprofit organization , reflects the problem . Two years ago , one or two patients at a time needed to be fed through tubes . Now , Mr. McFadden said , the center has about 35 at a time . And like other nursing homes , the center has felt the effects of a nationwide nursing shortage . The home , with 522 patients , has 85 nurses ; two years ago it had 114 . <> <> Nursing Homes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home showed that it was clean . Many of the 520 patients were in physical therapy , playing cards or watching the Mets on a large-screen television . But one floor had rooms with patients who were being tube-fed or were semicomatose. // Mrs. Lipschitz acknowledged that this was a departure from the image of the nursing home as the place where , as she put it , " Mom and Pop came to live out their years . " Many rooms had the appearance of a hospice , where terminally ill patients come to die . In the dining area , 100 places had been set for that night ' s supper , but there were no chairs . The patients who ate there would be coming in wheelchairs ; the rest would have to be served in their rooms. // Cynthia Rudder , director of the Nursing Home Community Coalition of New York State , a consumer group based in New York City , said : " That homes want to admit more heavy-care patients would not be so bad if patients such as those with Alzheimer ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may in fact need more attention than patients who are being tube-fed. " // The problem lies partly with the categories of care established by the state , which build a profit motive into patient classification , and partly with the forms used to help determine each patient ' s category . The forms , prepared by the State Health Department , measure patients ' mobility and their ability to feed and clean themselves , as well as their medical condition . <> <> Low Score for Alzheimer ' s // Depending on how patients are rated on the forms , they are placed in one of the 16 resource utilization groups that designate the level of care required . Each category carries a rating , from 0. 55 for the lightest care to 1. 8 for the heaviest . Each home then calculates its case mix index , the average rating for its Medicaid patients , which is the basis for reimbursement from the state. // Alzheimer ' s patients often score well and are placed in low-care groups -inappropriately so , Ms. Rudder said , arguing that the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Who ' s to say who needs more care , " said Mr. McFadden of the Isabella home , " a 65-year-old woman who has had a stroke , or one who is confused ? " // Mr. Gormley of the State Health Department acknowledged that the rating system needs to be adjusted and said the department was considering changing it . He added , however , that the system has checks and balances . For example , he said , Medicaid and Medicare require nursing homes to refuse patients for whom they can not provide adequate care. // He said the Health Department also inspects homes whose balance of heavy-care cases rises steeply from one reporting cycle to the next . This year , he said , inspectors have checked the quality of care in about two dozen homes whose case mix indexes rose 20 percent or more. // According to Mrs. Lipschitz , the bad effects of the new reimbursement plan are gradual . " It doesn ' t happen overnight , and it doesn ' t happen maliciously , " she said . " The aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more stressed . And one day you realize that maybe you admitted too many very sick people. " //
