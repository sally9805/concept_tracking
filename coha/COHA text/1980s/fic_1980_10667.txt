" The whole planet 's like this . Mikal did n't design this city , you know : It was a gift to him . " " The whole planet 's like this ? Beautiful ? " " No . Trimmed . With its nose in the air . People on Earth are very proud of their place as the heart of humanity . ' Heart , hell . On the fringe , that 's all they are , an insane fringe , too , if you ask me . They cling to their petty national identities as if they were religions . Which they are , I think . Terrible place for a capital  --  this planet is more fragmented than the rest of the galaxy . There are even independencemovements . " " From what ? " " From Mikal . His capital planet , and they think that just a piece of a planet should be free of him . " Riktors laughed . Ansset was genuinely puzzled . " But how can they divide it up ? Can they lift a piece of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be independent ? " " Out of the mouths of babes . " They rode in a flesket , of course , all transparent except for the view of the road beneath their feet , which would have made them sick to see . It was an hour from the port to the city , but now the palacewas in view , a jumble of what seemed to be stone in an odd , intricatestyle that looked lacy and delicate and solid as the planet itself . " Most of it 's underground , of course , " Riktors said . Ansset watched the building approach , saying nothing . It occurred to Riktors that perhaps the boy was nervous , afraid of the coming meeting . " Do you want to know what he 's like ? " Ansset nodded . " Old . Few men in Mikal 's business live to be old . There have been more than eight thousand plots against the emperor 's life . Since he got here to Earth . " Ansset did not register emotion until a moment later , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song of amazement . Then he said , so Riktors could understand , " A man that so many people want to die  --  he must be a monster ! " " Or a saint . " " Eight thousand . " " Fifty of them actually came close . Two of them succeeded in injuringthe emperor . You 'll understand the security arrangements that always surround him . People go to great lengths to try to kill him . Therefore we must go to great lengths to try to protect him . "  | " How , " Ansset asked , " did such a man ever earn the right to have a Songbird ? " The question surprised Riktors . Did Ansset really understand his own uniqueness in the universe right now ? Was he so vain about being a Songbird that he marveled that the emperor should have one ? No , Riktors decided . The boy was only just made a Songbird at the beginning of the flight that brought him here . He still thinks of Songbirds as other , as outside himself . Or does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " He came to the Songhouse years and years ago , and asked . According to the story I heard , he asked for anything  --  a Songbird , a singer , anything at all . Because he had heard a Songbird once and could n't live without the beauty of such music . And he talked to the old Songmaster , Nniv . And the new one , Esste . And they promised him a Songbird . " " I wonder why . " " He 'd already done most of his killing . His reputation preceded him . I doubt that they were fooled about that . Perhaps they just saw something in him . " " Of course they did , " Ansset said , and his voice chided gently so that suddenly Riktors felt young and vaguely patronized by the child beside him . " Esste would n't make a mistake . " " Would n't she ? " Devil 's advocate , Riktors thought . Why do I alwaysplay such opposite roles ? " There 's more than a little grumbling throughout the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , sending you to Mikal . " " Sold out ? For what price ? " Ansset asked mildly . And Riktors resented the scorn in the question . " Everything has a price . Mikal 's paying more for you than for dozens of ships of the fleet . You came for a high price . " " I came to sing , " Ansset said . " And if Mikal had been poor , but the Songhouse had decided he should have a Songbird , they would have paid him to take me . " Riktors raised an eyebrow . " It has happened , " Ansset said . " Are n't you a bit young to know history ? " Riktors asked , amused . " What family does n't know its own past ? " For the first time Riktors realized that the Songhouse 's isolation was not just a technique or a facade to raise respect . Ansset , and by extension all the singers , did n't really feel a kinship with the rest of humanity . At least not a close kinship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Riktors asked . " Who ? " Ansset answered , and they arrived . It was just as well.  |p82Ansset  's who was frigid and Riktors could not have pursued the questioninghad he wanted to . The child was beautiful , especially now that the scars and bruises had healed completely . But he was not normal . He could not be touched as other children could be touched . Riktors had prided himself on being able to make friends with children easily . But Ansset , he decided , was not a child . Days together on the flight , and the only thing their relationship had disclosed to Riktors was the fact that they had no relationship . Riktorshad seen Ansset with Esste , had seen love as loud as the roar of engines in atmosphere . But apparently the love had to be earned . Riktors had not earned it . Riktors had been hated by many people . It had never bothered him before . But he knew that , more than any other thing , he wanted this boy to love him . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing for ? Riktors asked himself . But even as he asked himself , Ansset took his hand and they walked off the flesket together , walked into the gate , and Riktors felt what little closeness they had had slipping away from him . He might as well still be on Tew , Riktors decided . He 's lightyears away , even holding my hand . The Songhouse has a hold on him that will never let go . Why the hell am I jealous ? And Riktors shook himself inwardly , and condemned himself for having let the Songhouse and this Songbird weave their spells around him . The Songbird is trained to win love . Therefore , I will not love him . And , once decided , it became very nearly true . The Chamberlain was a busy man . It was the most noticeable thing about him . He bounced slightly on the balls of his feet when he stood ; he leaned forward as he walked ; so anxious was he to reach his destination that even his feet could not keep up with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies , his normal conversation was quick , the words tumbling out so that you dared not let your attention flag for a moment or you would miss something , and to ask him to repeat himself  --  ah , he would fly into a rage and there would be your promotion for the year , utterly lost . So the Chamberlain 's men were quick , too . Or rather , seemed to be quick . For it did not take long for those who worked for the Chamberlain to realize that his quickness was an illusion . His wordsp83were rapid , but his thoughts were slow , and he took five or six conversationsto finally get to a point that might have been said in a sentence . It was maddening , infuriating , so that his underlings went to infinite pains to avoid speaking to him . Which was precisely what he wanted . " I am the Chamberlain , " he said to Ansset , as soon as they were alone . Ansset looked at him blankly . It took the Chamberlain a bit by surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayed nervous awareness of his power and position . From the boy ? Nothing . " You are aware , " he went on without waiting any longer for a response , " that I am administrator of this palace , and , by extension , this city . Nothing more . My authority does not extend any farther . Yet that authority includes you . Completely , utterly , without exception . You will do what I say . " Ansset looked at him unblinkingly . Damn , but I hate dealing with children , the Chamberlain thought . They are n't even the same species . " You 're a Songbird . You 're incredibly valuable . Therefore you will not go outside without permission . My permission . You will be accompanied by two of my men at all times . You will follow the sched- ' ule prepared for you , which will include ample opportunity for recreation . I can not have you out of my ken at any time . For the price paid for you , we could build another palace like this one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . No emotion at all . " Have you nothing to say ? " Ansset smiled slightly . " Chamberlain , I have my own schedules . Those are the ones I will keep . Or I can not sing . " It was unheard of . The Chamberlain could say nothing , nothing at all as the boy smiled at him . " And as to your authority , Riktors Ashen already explained every-thing . " " Did he ? What did he explain ? " " You do n't control everything , Chamberlain . You do n't control the palace guard , which has its own Captain appointed by Mikal . You do n't control any aspect of imperial government except palace administration and protocol . And no one , Chamberlain , controls me . Except me . " He had expected many things . But not to have a nine-year-old boy , however beautiful , speak with more command than an admiral ofp84the fleet . Yet the boy 's voice was an admirable lesson in strength . The Chamberlain , who was never confused , was thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The Songhouse does n't speak , Chamberlain . I must live in certainways to be able to sing . If I ca n't live as I must , then I will go home . " " This is impossible ! There are schedules that must be followedl " Ansset ignored him . " When do I meet Mikal ? " " When the schedule says so ! " " And when will that be ? " " When I say so . I make the schedule . I give access to Mikal or I deny access to Mikal ! " Ansset only smiled and hummed soothingly . The Chamberlain felt very much relieved . Later he tried to think why , but could n't . " That 's better , " the Chamberlain said . He was so relieved , in fact , that he sat down , the furniture flowing to fit him perfectly . " Ansset , you have no idea what an incredible burden the office of Chamberlainis . " " You have a lot to do . Riktors told me . " The Chamberlain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would have been distressed to know that Ansset read the flickers of emotion in his voice and knew that the Chamberlain had little love for Riktors Ashen . " I wonder , " the Chamberlain said . " I wonder if perhaps you might just sing something now . Music soothes the savage breast , you know . " " I would love to sing for you , " Ansset said . The Chamberlain waited a moment , then gazed questioningly at Ansset . " But , Chamberlain , " said Ansset , " I 'm Mikal 's Songbird . I ca n't sing for anyone until I 've met him and he 's given his consent . " There was just enough of mockery in the Songbird 's voice that the Chamberlain went hot inside , embarrassed , as if he had tried to sleep with his master 's wife and found that she was merely amused at him . The child was going to be a horror . " I 'll speak to Mikal about you . " " He knows I 'm here . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I said that I would speak to Mikal ! " The Chamberlain whirled and left , a quick , dramatic exit ; but the drama was spoiled when Ansset 's voice came gently after him , gentlyp85and yet exactly loud enough that it could have been whispering in his ear : " Thank you . " And the thank you was full of respect and gratitude so that the Chamberlain could n't be angry , indeed could think of no reason for anger . The boy was obviously going to be compliant . Obviously . The Chamberlain went straight to Mikal , something that only a few were allowed to do , and told him that the Songbird was there and eager to meet him , and was definitely a charming boy , if a bit stubborn , and Mikal said , " Tonight at twenty-two , " and the Chamberlainleft and told his men what to do and when to do it and adjusted the schedules to fit that appointment and then realized : He had done exactly what the boy had wanted . He had changed everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach . I hate the little bastard , said the hot flush in his cheeks a moment later . The contract said he 'd be here for six years . The Chamberlain thought of six years and they were long . Terribly , terribly long . The palace had no music . Ansset finally realized it with relief . Something had been nagging him since he arrived . It was not the impersonal search by the security guards or the casual way that he seemed to be fit into a machine and processed . He expected things to be different , and since everything was strange compared to life in the Songhouse , none of it should have felt " wrong . " He had a far from cosmopolitan outlook , but the Songhouse had never allowed him to think that the Songhouse way was " right " and all other ways were not . Rather the Songhouse was home , and this was merely a different place . But the lack of music . Even Bog had had music , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone that was harder than steel carried little sound ; the furniture was silent as it flowed to fit bodies ; the servants went silently about their business , as did the guards ; the only sounds were of machines , and even they were invariably muffled . On his visit to Step and Bog , he had had Esste with him . Someoneto whom he could sing and who would know the meanings ofp86his songs . Someone whose voice was full of inflection carefully controlled . Here everyone was so coarse , so unrefined , so careless . And Ansset felt homesick as he ran his fingers along the warm stone that was so unlike the cold rock of the walls of the Songhouse . He hummed in his throat , but these walls absorbed the sound , reflected nothing . Also , he was hot . That was wrong . He had been raised in a slightly chilly building since he was three . This place was warm enough that he could cast away his clothing and still be a little too warm . How can they be comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been alone ever since the obsequious servant had led him to a room and said , " This is yours . " No window , and the door had no device that Ansset could see for opening . So he waited and did not sing because he was not sure someone would not be listening  --  that much Riktors Ashen had warned him of . He sat alone in silence and listened to the utter lack of music in the palace , unwilling to make any of his own until he had met Mikal , and not knowing when that would be , or if it would happen at all , or if he would be left forever in a place where he might as well be deaf . No . That is also wrong . There is music here , Ansset realized . But it was cacophony , not harmony , and so he had not recognized it . In Step and Bog the moods of the cities had been uniform . While individuals had had their own songs , they were only variations on a theme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of its own . Here there was no such harmony . Only fear and mistrust to such a degree that no two voices worked together . As if the very melding of speech patternsand thought patterns and ease of expression might somehow compromise a person dangerously , bring him close to death or darker terrors . That was the music , if he could call it music , of the palace . What a dark place Mikal has made for himself . How can anyone live in such deafening silence and pain ? But perhaps it is not pain to them , Ansset thought . Perhaps this is the way of all the worlds . Perhaps only on Tew , which has the Songhouse , have voices learned to meet and mix harmoniously . He thought of the billions of pinpoint stars , each with its planets and each of those with their people , and none of them knew how to sing or hear anyone else 's song . It was a nightmare . He refused to think of it . Instead he thought of Esste , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held inside himself that she had finally compelled him to find . Re/membering her , he could not really see her face  --  he had left her too recently to be able to conjure her like a ghost . Instead he heard her voice , heard the huskiness of her morning speech , the force in her normal expression . She would not have been made uneasy . She would n't have let the silly Chamberlain force her into saying more than she ought . And if she were here , he thought , I would not feel so -- If she were here , she would not let herself feel any of these things . Some Songbirds had had difficult assignments before . Esste , whom he loved and trusted , had put him here . Therefore this was where he belonged . And so he would look for ways to survive , to put the palaceto use in his songs , instead of wishing that he were in the Songhouse instead . For this he had been trained . He would give his service and then , when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and four security guards came in . They were in different uniforms from those men who had searched him before . They said little , only enough to direct Ansset to take off his clothing . " Why ? " Ansset asked , but they only waited and waited until at last he turned his back and stripped . It was one thing to be naked among the other children in the toilets and showers , and something else again to be nude in front of adult men , all there for no other purposethan to watch . They searched every crevice of his body , and the search , while not overly rough , was also not pleasant . They were intimate with him as no one had ever been intimate before , and the man who fondled his genitals , searching for unfathomably arcane items  --  Ansset could think of nothing that could be hidden there  --  held and touched a little too long , a little too gently . He did not know what it meant , but knew that it was not good . The man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , Ansset detected the trembling , the faint passion suppressed in the interstices of his brusque speech , and it made him afraid . But the moment passed , and the guards gave him back his clothes , and they led him out of the room . They were tall ; they towered over him , and he felt awkward , unable to keep step with them and afraid of somehow getting under their feet , between their legs . The danger was more their anger if he tripped them up than any damage their legs might do to him . Ansset was still too hot , hotter now because he was moving fast and because he was tense . In the Songhouse his Control had been unshakable , except to Esste . But there he had been familiar with everything , able to cope with changes because everything but the change was everything he had known all his life.  |p88Here  he began to realize that people acted for different reasons , that they followed different patterns or no patterns at all ; and yet . He had been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it had worked . Human beings were still human beings . Even if they were large soldiers who trembled when they touched a naked littleboy . The guards touched the sides of doors , and the doors opened . Anssetwondered if his fingers , too , could open doors by touching them . Then the guards reached a door they could not open , or at least did n't try to open . Was Mikal on the other side ? No . The Chamberlain was , and the Captain of the guard , and a few other people , none of whom looked imperial . Not that Ansset had any clear idea of what an emperor would look like , but he knew almost immediately that none of these people was sure of power or enough in control of himself to rule on the strength of his own authority . In fact , Ansset had only met or seen one outsider who could  --  Riktors Ashen . And that was probably because Riktors was a starfleet commander who had bloodlessly quelled a rebellion . He knew what he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They asked questions . Seemingly random questions . About his training at the Songhouse , his upbringing before he got to Tew , and dozens of questions that Ansset could not begin to understand , let alone answer . How do you feel about the four freedoms ? Did they teach you in the Songhouse about the Discipline of Frey ? What about the heroes of Seawatch ? The League of Cities of the Sea ? And , finally : " Did n't they teach you anything at the Songhouse ? " " They taught me , " Ansset said , " how to sing . " The questioners looked at each other . The Captain of the guard finally shrugged . " Hell , he 's a nine-year-old kid . How many nine-yearoldkids know anything about history ? How many of them have any political views ? " " It 's the Songhouse I 'm worried about , " said a man whose voice sang death to Ansset . " Maybe , just maybe , " said the Captain , and his voice was oiled with sarcasm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nobody 's apolitical . " " They gave Mikal a Songbird , " the Captain pointed out . " It was a very unpopular thing to do , in the empire at large . I heard that somep89pompous ass on Prowk is returning his singer to them as a protest . " The Chamberlain raised a finger . " They did not give Mikal a Songbird . They charged a great deal . " " Which they did n't need , " said the man whose voice sang death . " They have more money than any other institution in the empire except the empire itself . So the question remains  --  why did they send this boy to Mikal ? I do n't trust them . It 's a plot . " A quiet man with large , heavy eyes left the edges of the room and touched the Chamberlain on the shoulder . " Mikal is waiting , " he said softly , but his message seemed to settle gloom on everyone . " I had begun to hope the Songhouse would actually delay long enough that  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , belligerently daring the Chamberlain to speak treason . " That we would n't have to put up with all this fuss . " The man whose voice sang death came over to Ansset , who sat with a blank face , watching him . He looked Ansset coldly in the eyes . " I suppose , " he finally said , " you might just be what you seem to be . " " What do I seem to be ? " Ansset asked innocently . The man paused before answering . " Beautiful , " he finally said , and there were tremolos of regret in his voice . He turned away , turned away and left the room through the door Ansset had entered by . Everyone seemed to be relieved . " Well , that 's that , " said the Chamberlain , and the Captain of the guard visibly relaxed . " I 'm supposed to command every starship in the fleet , and I spend an hour trying to get inside a child 's head . " He laughed . " Who was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at the Captain before answering . " He 's called Ferret . He 's an outside expert . " " Outside of what ? " " The palace , " answered the Captain . " Why were you all so glad to have him leave ? " " Enough questions , " said the large-eyed man , his voice gentle and trustworthy . " Mikal is ready for you . " So Ansset followed him to a door , which led to a small room where guards passed wands over their bodies and took , samples of blood , then to another door which led to a small waiting room . And at last an old , gritty voice came over a speaker and said , " Now . " A door slid upward in what looked like a section of wall , and they passed from the false stone to a room of real wood . Ansset did notp90yet know that this , of all things , was a mark of Mikal 's wealth and power . On Tew , forests were everywhere and wood was easy to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by death , against poaching wood from the forests , a law which had been made perhaps twenty thousand years before , when the forests had almost died . Only the poorest exempt peasants in Siberia could cut wood  --  and Mikal . Mikal could have wood . Mikal could have anything he wanted . Even a Songbird . There was a fire ( burning wood ! ) in a fireplace at one end of the room . By it , on the floor , lay Mikal . He was old , but his body was lithe . His face was sagging but his arms were firm , bare to the shoulderwith no hint of the loss of muscle . The eyes were deep , and they regarded Ansset steadily . The servantled Ansset partway into the room , and then left . " Ansset , " said the emperor . Ansset lowered his head in a gesture of respect . Mikal rose from his lying position to sit on the floor . There was furniture in the room , but it was far back at the walls , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mikal said . Ansset walked toward him , stopped and stood still when he was only a meter or so away . The fire was warm . But , Ansset noticed , the room was otherwise cool . Mikal had said only two words , and Ansset did not know his songs , not from that little bit . Yet there had been kindness , and a feeling of awe . Awe , from the emperor of mankind toward a boy . " Would you like to sit ? " Mikal asked . Ansset sat . The floor , which had felt rigid to his feet , softened when his weight was distributed over a larger area , and the floor was comfortable . Too comfortable  --  Ansset was not used to softness . " Have you been treated well ? " For a moment Ansset did not answer . He was listening to Mikal 's songs , and did not realize that a question had been asked , not until he had begun to understand a little of the reason a Songbird had been sent to a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you afraid to answer ? " Mikal asked . " I assure you , if you 've been mistreated in any way --  " " I do n't know , " Ansset said . " I do n't know what passes for good treatment here . " Mikal was amused , but showed it only warily . Ansset admired his control . Not Control , of course , but something akin to it , somethingp91that made him hard to hear . " What passes for good treatment in the Songhouse ? " " No one ever searched me in the Songhouse , " Ansset said . " No one ever held my penis as if he wanted to own it . " Mikal did not answer for a moment , though the pause was the only sign of emotion Mikal let himself show . " Who was it ? " Mikal asked calmly . " It was the tall one , with the silver stripe . " Ansset felt a strange excitement in being able to name the man . What would Mikal do ? The emperor turned to a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a tall guard , a sergeant , among those who searched the boy . " A moment of silence , and then a soft voice answering  --  the Captain'svoice , Ansset realized , but muted somehow , all harshness sifted out and softened . Was it the machinery ? Or did the Captain speak this tenderly to Mikal ? " Callowick , " said the Captain . " What did he do ? " " He found the boy tempting , " Mikal said . " Break him and get him off planet somewhere . " Mikal took his hand from the table . For a moment Ansset felt a thrill of delight . He did not really understand what the guard had done , this Callowick , except that he had not liked it . But Mikal refused to let it happen again , Mikal would punish those who offended him , Mikal would keep him as safe as he had been in the Songhouse . Safer , for in the Songhouse Ansset had been hurt , and here no one would dare hurt him for Mikal 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life and death , and it was delicious . " You have power , " Ansset said aloud . " Do I ? " asked Mikal , looking at him intently . " Everyone knows that . " " And do you ? " Mikal asked . " A kind of power , " Ansset said , but there had been something in Mikal 's question . Something else , a sort of plea , and Ansset searched in his memory of this new , strange voice , to hear what the question was really asking . " A kind of power , but you see the end of it . It makes you afraid . " Mikal said nothing now . just looked carefully at Ansset 's face . Ansset was afraid for a moment . Surely this was not what Esste had urged him to do . You must make friends , she had said , because you understand so much more . Do I ? Ansset wondered now . I understandsome things , but this man has hidden places . This man is dangerous , too ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something now , " Ansset said , outwardly calm . " I ca n't know you if I do n't hear your voice . " Mikal smiled , but his eyes were wary , and so was his voice . " Then perhaps I would be wise to be silent . " It was enough of Mikal 's voice , and held enough of the emperor 's emotion that Ansset could reach a little further . " I do n't think it 's the loss of your power that you fear , " Ansset said . " I think  --  I think --  " And then words failed him , because he did not understand what he saw and heard in Mikal , not in a way he could express in words . So he sang . With some words , here and there , but the rest melodies and rhythms that spoke of Mikal 's love of power . You do n't love power like a hungry man loves food , the song seemed to say . You love power like a father loves his son . Ansset sang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased until it filled the universe . And then Ansset sang of the room where Mikal lived , filled it to the wooden walls with his voice , and let the sound reverberate in the wood , let it dance and become lively and , though it distorted his tone , come back to add depth to the song . And as he sang the songs he had just learned from Mikal , Ansset became more daring , and sang the hope of friendship , the offer of trust . He sang the love song . And when he had finished , Mikal regarded him with his careful eyes . For a moment Ansset wondered if the song had had any effect . Then Mikal reached out a hand , and it trembled , and the trembling was not from age . Reached out a hand , and Ansset also held out a hand , and laid it in the old man 's palm . Mikal 's hand was large and strong , and Ansset felt that he could be swallowed up , seized and gathered into Mikal 's fist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Ansset 's hand , the touch was gentle , the grip firm yet kind , and Mikal 's voice was heavy with emotion when he said , " You are . What I had hoped for . " Ansset leaned forward . " Please do n't be too satisfied yet , " he said . " Your songs are hard to sing , and I have n't learned them all yet . " " My songs ? I have no songs . " " Yes you have . I sang them to you . " Mikal looked disturbed . " Where did you get the idea that they were -- - " " I heard them in your voice . " The idea surprised Mikal , took him off guard . " But there was so much beauty in what you sang  --  " " Sometimes , " Ansset answered . " Yes . And so much  --  what , I do n't know . Perhaps . Perhaps youp93found such songs in me . " He looked doubtful . He sounded disappointed . " Is this a trick you play ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To hear what 's going on in your patron 's voice and sing it back to him ? No wonder I liked the song . But do n't you have any songs of yourself ? " Now it was Ansset 's turn to be surprised . " But what am I ? " " A good question , " Mikal said . " A beautiful nine-year-old boy . Is that what they were waiting for ? A body that would make a polygamistregret ever having loved women , a face that mothers and fatherswould follow for miles , coveting for their children . Did I want a catamite ? I think not . Did I want a mirror ? Perhaps when I met the Songmaster so many years ago he was not so wise as I thought . Or perhaps I 've changed since then . " " I 'm sorry I disappointed you . " Ansset let his real fear show in his voice . Again , it was what Esste had told him : Hide nothing from your patron . It had been easy , after the ordeal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here , now , with this strange man who had not liked the song even though it had moved him deeply  --  it took real effort to keep the walls down . Ansset felt as vulnerable as when the soldier had fondled him , and as ignorant of what it was he feared . Yet he showed the fear , because that was what Esste had told him to do , and he knew she would not be wrong . Mikal 's face set hard . " Of course you did n't disappoint me . I told you . That song was what I hoped for . But I want to hear a song of yourself . Surely you have songs of your own . " " I have , " Ansset answered . " Will you sing them to me ? " " I will , " said Ansset . And so he sang , beginning timidly because he had never sung these songs except to people who already loved him , people who were also creatures of the Songhouse and so needed no explanation . But Mikal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward with his melody , trying to find a way to tell Mikal who he was , and finally realizing that he could not , that all he could tell him was the meaning of the Songhouse , was the feel of the cold stone under his fingers , was the kindness of Rruk when he had wept in fear and uncertainty and she had sung confidence to him , though she herself was only a child . I am a child , said Ansset 's song , as weak as a leaf in the wind , and yet , along with a thousand other leaves I have roots that go deep into rock , the cold , living rocks of the Songhouse . I am a child , andp94my fathers are a thousand other children , and my mother is a woman who broke me open and brought me out and warmed me in the cold storm where I was suddenly naked and suddenly not alone . I am a gift , fashioned by my own hands to be given to you by others , and I do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself inexorably heading toward the one song he would never have thought to sing . The song of the days in the High Room . The song of his birth . I ca n't , he thought as the melodies swept into his throat and out of his teeth . I ca n't bear it , he cried to himself as the emotions came , not in tears , but in passionate tones that came from the most tender places in him . I ca n't bear to stop , he thought as he sang of Esste 's love for him and his terror at leaving her so soon after having learned to lean on her . And in his song , too , he heard something that surprised him . He heard , through all the emotion of his memories , a thread of dissonance , a thread that spoke of hidden darkness in him . He searched for that note and lost it . And gradually the search for the strangenessin his own song took him out of the song , and brought him to himself again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song at last died , too . And it was then that he realized that Mikal lay curled around him , his arm embracing Ansset , the other arm covering his face , where he wept , where he sobbed silently . With the song over , the sparks were the only music in the room as the last fusses of flame kept trying to revive the fire . Oh , what have I done ? Ansset cried to himself as he watched the emperor of mankind , Mikal the Terrible , weeping into his hand . " Oh , Ansset , " said Mikal , " what have you done ? " And then , after a moment , Mikal stopped crying and rolled over onto his back and said , " Oh , God , it 's too kind , it 's too cruel . I 'm a hundred and twenty-one years old and death lurks in the walls and floor , waiting to catch me unawares . Why could n't you have come to me when I was forty ? " Ansset did not know if an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he finally said , and Mikal laughed . " That 's right . You were n't born yet . Nine years old . What do they do to you in the Songhouse , Ansset ? What terrible squeezing they must do , to wring such songs out of you . " " Did you like my song this time ? " " Like ? " Mikal asked , wondering if the boy was joking . " Like ? " And he laughed a long time , and laid his head on Ansset 's lap . The two of them slept there that night , and from then on there were nop95more searches , no more questions . Ansset was free to come to Mika , because there was no time when Mikal did not long to have him there . " You 're in luck , " their guide told them , and Kya-Kya sighed . She had been hoping that they would be lucky enough to get out of Susquehanna after only the normal five-hour tour . But she was sure that was not what the guide had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " has asked to meet with you . This is a very great honor . But , as the Chamberlain told me just a few moments ago , you students from the Princeton Government Institute are the future administratorsof this great empire . It is only just that Mikal should meet with his future aides and helpers . " Aides and helpers , hell , Kya-Kya thought . The old man will die before I graduate , and then we 'll be aiding and helping somebody else  --  probably the bastard who killed him . She had work to do . Some of the trips and tours were worthwhile  --  the four days they spent at the computer center in Tegucigalpa , the week observing the operation of a welfare services outlet in Rouen . But here at Susquehanna they were shown nothing of any importance , just as a matter of form . The city existed to keep Mikal alive and safe  --  the real government work went on elsewhere . Worse , the palace had been designed by a madman ( probably Mikal himself , she thought ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rose and fell through meaningless ramps and stairways . The building seemed to be one vast barrier , and her legs ached from the long walk between one exhibit and another . Several times she could have sworn that they walked up one corridor , lined with doors on the left , and then turned 18o degrees and walked down a parallel corridor with doors on the left that led only to the corridor they had just traveled . Maddening . Wearying . " And what 's more , " said the guide , " the Chamberlain even hinted that you might get a chance usually granted only to distinguished offworld visitors . You may get to hear Mikal 's Songbird . " There was a buzz of interest among the students . Of course they had all heard of Mikal 's Songbird , at first the scandalous news that Mikal had forced even the Songhouse to bend to his will , and then the spreading word from those privileged few who had heard the boyp96sing : that Mikal 's Songbird was the greatest Songbird ever , that no human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt something entirely different , however . None of her fellow students knew she was from the Songhouse , or even from Tew . She had been discreet to the point of aloofness . And she did not long to see Ansset again , not the boy who had been Esste 's favorite , not the boy who was the opposite of her . But there was no escape from the group . Kya-Kya was systematicallybeing a model student  --  creative but compliant . Sometimes it nearly killed her , she thought , but she made ' sure there would be glowing recommendations from every professor , a perfect record of achievement . It was hard for a woman to get a job in government at all . And the kind of job she wanted usually came to a woman only as the climax of her career , not at the beginning . So Kya-Kya said nothing , as they filed into the seats that formed a horseshoe whose open end framed Mikal 's throne . Kya-Kya took a seat near one end , so that she would be looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct eye contact . Eye contactallowed them to lie . " You should stand , " said the guide deferentially , and of course they all took the suggestion and stood . A dozen uniformed guards entered the hall and fanned out to positions along the walls . Then the Chamberlain entered and announced in slow , ceremonial tones , " Mikal Imperator has come to you . " And Mikal came in . The man was old , the face lined and creased and sagging , but his step was bright and quick and his smile seemed to come from a light heart . Kya-Kya of course rejected that first impression , for it was obviouslythe public relations face that Mikal wore to impress visitors . Yet he seemed to be in undeniably good health . Mikal came to the throne and sat , and it was then that Kya-Kya realized that Ansset had come into the room with him . Mikal 's presencewas so overpowering that even the beautiful Songbird had not been able to distract . Now , however , Mikal took the boy 's hand and gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the throne , where he stood alone and looked at everyone in the small audience . Kya-Kya did not watch Ansset , however . She watched the other students watching him . They all wondered , of course , if a boy of such great beauty had found his way into Mikal 's bed . Kya-Kya knew better . The Songhouse would never tolerate it . They would never send a Songbird to someone who would try such a thing . Ansset turned all the way to look at the end of the row of chairs , and his eyes met Kya-Kya 's . If he recognized her , he gave no sign.  |p97But  Kya-Kya knew enough about Control to know that he could well have recognized her  --  in fact , probably had . And then he sang . The song was powerful . It was all the hopes and finest ambitions of the students there , a song of serving mankind and being honored for it . The words were simple , but the melody made all of them want to shout for the excitement of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great hall of the Songhouse . Remembered hearing others sing there , and how she had felt at the first gathering after she had been declared Deaf . There was no hope in the song for her . And in a way her own bitterness at Ansset 's song was a pleasure . He obviously was singing what the students most wanted to hear , trying to touch everyone in the audience . But he would never touch her . When Ansset finished , the students did stand , did clap and cheer . Ansset bowed shyly , then walked from the place in front of Mikal 's throne and came to stand near the wall . Not two meters from KyaKya . She glanced at him when he came . It hurt her to see up close how beautiful he was , how kind and happy his face seemed in repose . He did not seem to look at her , so she looked away . Mikal began to speak then , the usual things about how important it was for them to study hard and learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they had the deep inner resources to cope with the unexpected . And so on , thought Kya-Kya , and on and on and on and on . " Listen , " said a voice in Kya-Kya 's ear . She whirled and saw only Ansset , still a couple of meters off , still not looking at her . But she had been forced out of her reverie ; she heard Mikal . " You will naturally rise quickly to important positions , with many people under you . Often you 'll become impatient with the sluggish people under you . The petty bureaucrats who seem to love to own every piece of paper that crosses their desks for as long as they possiblycan before passing it on . They seem to have tiny minds , no ambitions , no vision of what the government ought to be doing . You 'll long to take a heavy broom and sweep the bastards out . God knows I 've wanted to often enough . " The students laughed , not because of what he said , but because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so openly to them . " But do n't do it . Do n't do it unless you absolutely have to . The bureaucrats are our treasures , the most valuable part of the government . You who have great ability , you 'll rise , you 'll change , you 'll get bored , you 'll move from job to job . If you had a different kind of em/peror , some of you would get removed from time to time and sent to  --  Well , I have n't the kind of imagination to conjure up the sort of places offensive administrators might get sent . " Again a laugh . Kya-Kya was disgusted . " Listen , " said the voice again , and this time when Kya-Kya turned , Ansset was looking at her . " I know it 's treason to speak of it , but I doubt that any of you have failed to notice that I 'm old . I 've ruled a long time . I 'm past a man 's normal life expectancy . Someday , I have reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unsure of what this had to do with them , but certain that they wished they were not hearing such things . " When that happens , someone else will take my place . I do n't come from a particularly long dynasty , and there may be some questionas to who is my legitimate heir . There may even be some nastinessover the question . Some of you will be tempted to take sides . And those who choose the wrong side will pay for your mistake . But while all the storms rage , those paper-pushing bureaucrats will go on in their stodgy , incompetent way , running the government . Already they have such inertia that I could n't possibly change them even if I wanted to . Here and there , a few changes . Here and there an improvement , or a brilliant bureaucrat who deserves and damn well better get a promotion . But most of them will go on doing things in the same infinitely slow way , and that , my young friends , will be the salvation and the preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureaucracy . Keep it , if you can , under control . But never weaken it . It will save mankind when every visionary has failed , when every utopia has crumbled . Bureaucracy is the one eternalthing mankind has created . " And then Mikal smiled , and all the students laughed again , because they realized that he knew he was exaggerating . But they also knew that he meant much of what he said , and they understood his vision of the future . That it did n't matter who was at the helm , as long as the crew knew how to run the ship . But no one understood him so well as Kya-Kya . There was no time-honored system of succession to the throne , as there had been in the Songhouse , where the choice of the Songmaster of the High Room had been left up to a Deaf and no one had even protested her choice . Instead , the rule of the empire would pass to whoever was strongest and most determined at the time of Mikal 's death . In history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to promote a favorite or a relative as successor . Mikal had no such in/tention . He was announcing to the students from the Princeton GovernmentInstitute that he was going to leave the succession up to the law of natural selection , while trying to build institutions that would survive the turmoil . The first few years after Mikal 's death will be interesting , Kya-Kya decided , and wondered why , when those years were bound to be miserableand full of slaughter , she was so glad to know she would be alive and working in government during them . Mikal stood , and so everyone stood , and when he had gone they erupted into dozens of different conversations . Kya-Kya was amused at how effectively Mikal had taken everyone in with his warmth and casualness . Had they forgotten that this man had killed billions of people on burned-over worlds , that only brute force and utter callousnesshad brought him to power ? And yet she also had to admire the fact that after a life like the one Mikal had led , he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  no , be honest , everyone in the room  --  now thought of him as grandfatherly . Kind . A gentleman and gentle man . And wise . Well , give the old bastard that . He was smart enough to stay alive as the number one target in the galaxy . He 'd probably die in bed . " Contempt is so easy , " said Ansset 's voice beside her . She spun to face him . " I thought you were gone . What did you mean , telling me to listen ? " She was surprised that she spoke angrily to him . " Because you were n't . " The boy 's voice was gentle , but she heard the undertones of songtalk . " Do n't try it with me . I ca n't be fooled . " " Only a fool ca n't be fooled , " Ansset answered . He had grown , she noticed . " You pretend not to like Mikal . But of all the people here , you 're the one most like him . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattered . " Do I look like the killer type ? " she asked . " You 'll get what you want , " Ansset answered . " And you 'll kill to get it , if you have to . " " Not just songs but psychology , too . How far-reaching your trainingmust have been . " " I know your songs , Kya-Kya , " Ansset said . " I heard your singing when you came to Esste in my stall that day . " " I never sang . " " No , Kya-Kya . You always sang . You just never heard the song . " Ansset started to turn away . But his air of confidence , of superiority , angered Kya-Kya . " Ansset ! " she called , and he stopped andp100faced her . " They 're using you , " she said . " You think they care about you , but they 're only using you . A tool . A foolish , ignorant tool ! " She had not spoken loudly , but when she turned she realized that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and Ansset . She walked away from the boy and threaded her way through the students , who knew enough not to say anything , but who no doubt wondered how she had gotten into a conversation with Mikal 's Songbird , and no doubt marveled that she had been able to bring herself to be angry at him . That had been enough to keep the students gossiping for days . But before she reached the door , she heard all the conversations fall silent , and Ansset 's voice rose above the fading chatter to sing a wordlesssong that she , alone of all the students , knew was a song of hope and friendship and honest good wishes . She closed her mind to the boy 's Songhouse tricks and left the room , where she could wait outsidein silence with the guards until the guide came to lead them all away . The buses , all fleskets from the Institute , took them home to Princeton with only one stop , in the ancient city of Philadelphia , where one of the older men students was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the fifteenth in a wave of kidnap murders that had terrorized Philadelphia and many other cities in the area . The rest of the students returned in utter gloom to Princeton and resumed their studies . But Kya-Kya did not forget Ansset . Could not forget him . Death was in the air , and while Mikal could not be responsible for the mad killings in Philadelphia , she could not help but believe that he , too , would die mutilated . But the mutilation had been going on for years , and she thought of Ansset , and how he , too , might be twisted and deformed , and for all that she cared nothing for the Songhouse and even less for Mikal 's Songbird , she could not help but hope that somehow the beautiful boy who had remembered her after all these years could emerge unsullied from Susquehanna and go home to the Songhouse clean . And she fretted , because she was in school and the world was passingon quickly toward great events that she would not be part of unlessshe hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was twenty years old and brilliant and impatient and frustrated as hell . She cried for the Songhouse one night when she went to bed especiallytired.  |p101Ansset  walked in the garden by the river . In the Songhouse , the gardenhad been a patch of flowers in the courtyard , or the vegetables in the farmland behind the last chamber . Here , the garden was a vast stretch of grass and shrubs and tall trees that stretched along the two forks of the Susquehanna to where they joined . On the other side of both rivers was dense , lush forest , and the birds and animals often emerged from the trees to drink or eat from the river . The Chamberlainhad pleaded with Ansset not to wander in the garden . The space was too large , kilometers in every direction , and the wilderness too dense to do any decent patrolling . But in the two years he had lived in Mikal 's palace , Ansset had tested the limits of his life and found they were broader than the Chamberlain would have liked . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and schedules but because it would displease Mikal , and displeasing Mikal was never something Ansset desired . He could not follow Mikal into meetings unless he was specifically invited . There were times when Mikal needed to be alone  --  Ansset never had to be told , he noticed the mood come over Mikal and left him . There were other things , however , that Ansset had learned he could do . He could enter Mikal 's private room without asking permission . He discovered , by trial and error , that only a few doors in the palace would not open to his fingers . He had wandered the labyrinthof the palace and knew it better than anyone ; it was a way he often amused himself , to stand near a messenger when he was being sent on an errand , and then plan a route that would get him to the destination long before the messengers . It unnerved them , of course , but soon they got into the spirit of the game and raced him , occasionallyreaching the end before Ansset . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chamberlain had argued over it with Mikal , but Mikal had looked Ansset in the eye and asked , " Does it matter to you , to walk in the garden ? " " It does , Father Mikal . " " And you have to walk alone ? " " If I can . " " Then you will . " And that was the end of the argument . Ofp102course , the Chamberlain had men watching from a distance , and occasionally a flit passed overhead , but usually Ansset had the feeling of being alone . Except for the animals . It was something he had n't had that much experience with at the Songhouse . Occasional trips to the open country , to the lake , to the desert . But there had not been so many creatures , and there had not been so many songs . The chatter of squirrels , the cries of geese and jays and crows , the splash of leaping fish . How could men have borne to leave this world ? Ansset could not fathom the impulse that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to planets that , as often as not , killed them . In the peace of birdsong and rushing water it was impossible to imagine wanting to leave this place , if it was your home . But it was not Ansset 's home . Though he loved Mikal as he had loved no one but Esste , and though he understood the reasons why he had been sent to be Mikal 's Songbird , he nevertheless turned his back on the river and looked at the palace with its dead false stone and longed to be home again . And as he faced the palace , he heard a sound in the river behind him , and the sound chilled him like a cold wind , and he would have turned to face the danger except that the gas reached him first , and he fell , and remembered nothing of the kidnapping . There were no recriminations . The Chamberlain did n't dare say I told you so , and Mikal , though he hid his grief well , was too grieved and worried to bother with blaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And that was all . Said it to the Captain of the guard , to the Chamberlain , and to the man with death in his voice who was Mikal 's ferret . " Find him . " And they searched . The news spread quickly , of course , that Mikal'sSongbird had been kidnapped , and the people who read and cared at all about the court worried also that the beautiful Songbird might have been a victim of the mutilator who still went uncaught in Philadelphia and Manam and Hisper . Yet the mutilator 's victims were found every day with their bodies torn to pieces , and never was one of the bodies Ansset 's . All the ports were closed , and the fleet circled Earth with orders to take any ship that tried to leave the planet and stop any ship thatp103tried to land . Travel between districts and precincts was forbidden on Earth , and thousands of flits and flecks and fleskets were stopped and searched . But there was no sign of Ansset . And while Mikal went about his business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he bent a little as he walked and the fact that the spring was gone from his step . Some thought that Ansset had been stolen for profit , or had been kidnapped by the mutilator and the body simply had not been found . But those who saw what the kidnappingdid to Mikal knew that if someone had wanted to weaken Mikal , hurt him as deeply as he could be hurt , there could have been no better way than to take the Songbird . The doorknob turned . That would be dinner . Ansset rolled over on the hard bed , his muscles aching . As always , he tried to ignore the burning feeling of guilt in the pit of his stomach . As always , he tried to remember what had happened during the day , for the last heat of day always gave way to the chill of night soon after he awoke . And , as always , he could neither explain the guilt nor remember the day . It was not Husk with food on a tray . This time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not his name . Master was always near anger and fearsomely strong , one of the few men Ansset had met in his life who could make him feel as helpless as the eleven-year-old child his body said he was . " Get up , Songbird . " Ansset slowly stood . They kept him naked in prison , and only his pride kept him from turning away from the harsh eyes that looked him up and down . Only his Control kept his cheeks from burning with shame . " It 's a good-bye feast we 're having for you , Chirp , and ye 're going to twitter for us . " Ansset shook his head . " If ye can sing for the bastard MikaI , ye can sing for honest freemen . " Ansset let his eyes blaze . His voice was on fire as he said , " Be carefulhow you speak of him , traitor ! " Master advanced a step , raising his hand angrily . " My orders wasp104not to mark you , Chirp , but I can give you pain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ye talk to a freeman . Now yell sing . " Ansset had never been struck a blow in his life . But it was more the fury in the man 's voice than the threat of violence that made Ansset nod . But he still hung back . " Can you please give me my clothing ? " " It a n't cold where we 're going , " Master said . " I 've never sung like this , " Ansset said . " I 've never performed without clothing . " Master leered . " What is it then that you do without clothing ? Mikal 's catamite has naw secrets we ca n't see . " Ansset did n't understand the word , but he understood the leer , and he followed Master out the door and down a dark corridor with his heart even more darkly filled with shame . He wondered why they were having a " good-bye feast " for him . Was he to be set free ? Had Mikal paid some unimaginable ransom for him ? Or was he to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going through . It was not vanity but recognition of the truth when Ansset concluded for the hundredth time that Mikal would be frantic , yet bound by pride and the necessities of government to show nothing at all . Surely , though , surely Mikal would spare no effort hunting for him . Surely Mikal would come and take him back . The floor rocked gently as they walked down the wooden corridor . Ansset had long since decided he was imprisoned on a ship , though he had never been on a boat larger than the canoe he had learned to row on the pond near the palace . The amount of real wood used in it would have seemed gaudy and pretentious in a rich man 's home . Here , however , it seemed only shabby . Peasant rights and nothing more . Far above he could hear the distant cry of a bird , and a steady singing sound that he imagined to be wind whipping through ropes and cables . He had sung the melody to himself sometimes , and often harmonized to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocking bow indicated that Ansset should enter first . The boy stopped in the doorframe . Gathered around a long table were twenty or so men , some of whom he had seen before , all of them dressed in one of the strange national costumes of the past-worshipping people of Earth . Ansset could n't help remembering how Mikal mocked such people when they came to court to present demands or ask for favors . " All these ancient costumes , " Mikal would say as he lay with Ansset on thep105floor , staring into the fire . " All these ancient costumes mean nothing . Their ancestors were n't peasants , most of them . Their ancestors were the wealthy and effete from boring worlds who came back to Earth hunting for some meaning . They stole the few peasant customsthat remained , and did shoddy research to discover some more , and thought that they had found truth . As if shitting in the grass is somehow nobler than doing it into a converter . " The great civilizations such people claimed to belong to were petty and insignificant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . But here , where Ansset looked closely into their rough faces and unsmilingeyes , he realized that whatever these people 's ancestors might have been , they had acquired the strength of primitiveness , and they reminded him of the vigor of the Songhouse . Except that their muscleswere massive with labor that would have astonished a singer . And Ansset stood before them soft and white and beautiful and vulnerableand , despite his Control , was afraid . They looked at him with the same curious , knowing , lustful look that Master had given him . Ansset knew that if he allowed the slightest hint of cringing into his manner , they would be encouraged . So he stepped farther into the room , and nothing about his movementshowed any sign of the embarrassment and fear that he felt . He seemed unconcerned , his face as blank as if he had never felt any emotion in his life . " Up on the table ! " roared Master behind him , and hands lifted him onto the wood smeared with spilled wine and rough with crumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bastarrd . " And so he closed his eyes and shaped the ribs around his lungs , and let a low tone pass through his throat . For two years he had not sung except at Mikal 's request . Now he sang for Mikal 's enemies , and perhaps should have torn at them with his voice , made them cringe before his hatred . But hatred had not been born in Ansset , nor had his life bred it into him , and so he sang something else entirely . Sang softly without words , holding back the tone so that it barely reached their ears . " Louder , " someone said , but Ansset ignored him , and soon the jokes and laughter died down as the men strained to hear . The melody was a wandering one , passing through tones and quartertoneseasily , gracefully , still low in pitch , but rising and falling rhythmically . Unconsciously Ansset moved his hands in the strange gestures that had accompanied all his songs since he had opened his heart to Esste in the High Room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been puzzled by a notice in a **25;7502;TOOLONG that he had read in the palace library : " To hear Mikal 's Songbird is heavenly , but to watch his hands dance as he sings is nirvana . " It was a prudent thing to write in the capital of Eastamerica , not two hundred kilometers from Mikal 's palace . But it was the visionof Mikal 's Songbird held by all those who thought of him at all , and Ansset did not understand , could not picture what they saw . He only knew what he sang , and now he began to sing words . They were not words of recrimination , but rather the words of his captivity , and the melody became high , in the soft upper notes that opened his throat and tightened the muscles at the back of his head and tensed the muscles along the front of his thighs . The notes pierced , and as he slid up and down through haunting thirdtones , his words spoke of the dark , mysterious guilt he felt in the evenings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his longing for Father Mikal ( though he never spoke his name , not in front of these men ) , of dreams of the gardens along the Susquehanna River , and of lost , forgotten days that vanished from his memory before he awoke . Most of all , though , he sang of his guilt . At last he became tired , and the song drifted off into a whispered dorian scale that ended on the wrong note , on a dissonant note that faded into silence that sounded like part of the song . Finally Ansset opened his eyes . Even when he sang for an audiencehe neither liked nor wanted to sing for , he could not help but give them what they wanted . All the men who were not weeping were watching him . None seemed willing to break the mood , until a youngish man down the table said in a thick accent , " Ah but thet were better than hame and mitherma . " His comment was greeted by sighs and chuckles of agreement , and the looks that met Ansset 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and kind . Anssethad never thought to see such looks in those coarse faces . " Will ye have some wine , boy ? " asked Master 's voice behind him , and Husk poured . Ansset sipped the wine , and dipped a finger in it to east a drop into the air in the graceful gesture he had learned in the palace . " Thank you , " he said , handing back the metal cup with the same grace he would have used with a goblet at court . He lowered his head , though it hurt him to use that gesture of respect to such men , and asked , " May I leave now ? " " Do you have to ? Ca n't you sing again ? " It was as if the men around the table had forgotten that Ansset was their prisoner . And he , in turn , refused them as if he were free to choose . " I ca n't do it twice . I can never do it twice . " Not for them , anyway . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was new.  |p107They  lifted him off the table then , and Master 's strong arms carriedhim back to his room . Ansset lay on the bed after the door locked shut , his Control easing , letting his body tremble . The last song he had sung before this had been for Mikal . A light and happy song , and Mikal had smiled the soft , melancholy smile that only touched his face when he was alone with his Songbird . And Ansset had touched Mikal 's hand , and Mikal had touched Ansset 's face , and then Ansset had left to walk along the river . Ansset drifted off to sleep thinking of the songs in Mikal 's gray eyes , humming of the firm hands that ruled an empire and yet could still stroke the forehead of a beautiful child and weep at a sorrowful song . Ah , sang Ansset in his mind , ah , the weeping of Mikal 's sorrowfulhands . Ansset awoke walking down a street . " Out of the way , ya chark ! " shouted a harsh accent behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipped past his right arm . " Sausages , " shouted a sign on the case behind the driver . Then Ansset was seized by a terrible vertigo as he realized that he was not in the cell of his captivity , that he was fully dressed , though not in the clothing of the Songhouse . He was alive and free of his captors and the quick joy that realization brought was immediately soured by a rush of the old guilt , and the conflicting emotions and the suddenness of his liberation were too much for him , and for a moment too long he forgot to breathe , and the darkening ground slid sideways , tipped up , hit him --  " Hey , boy , are you all right ? " " Did the chark slam you , boy ? " " I got the number of the cart . We can get him ! " " He 's comin ' around and to . " Ansset opened his eyes . " Where is this place ? " he asked softly . Why , this is Northet , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansset asked , vaguely remembering that he had heard of Northet as a suburb of Hisper . " The palace ? What palace ? " " Mikal 's palace  --  I must go to Mikal  --  " Ansset tried to get up , but his head spun and he staggered . Hands held him up . " The kit 's kinky , that 's what . "  | " Mikal 's palace . " " It 's only sixty kilometer , boy , should I have ' em hold supper for you ? " The joke brought a burst of laughter , but Ansset had regained Control and he pulled away from the hands holding him and stood alone . Whatever drug had kept him unconscious was now nearly worked out of his system . " Find me a policeman , " Ansset said . " Mikal will want to see me immediately . " Some still laughed , but others looked carefully at Ansset , perhaps noticing that he spoke without an Eastamerican accent , that his bearing was not that of a streetchild . " Who are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mikal 's Songbird . " They looked , realized that the face was the one pictured in the papers ; half of them ran off to find authorities who could handle the situation , while the other half stayed to look at his face , to realize how beautiful his eyes were , to hold the moment so they could tell about it to their children and grandchildren . I saw Ansset himself , Mikal 's Songbird , they would say , and when their children asked , What was Mikal 's Songbird ? they would answer , ah , he was beautiful , he was the most valuable of all the treasures of Mikal the Terrible , the sweetest face you ever saw , and songs that could bring rain out of the sky or a flower from the deep of the snow . They reached out , and he touched their hands , and smiled at them , and wondered how they wanted him to act  --  embarrassed at their awe , or accustomed to it ? He read the songs in their voices as they murmured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Lovely . " And decided that they wanted him to be poised , to be beautiful and graciousand distant so their worship would be uninterrupted . " Thank you , " Ansset said , " thank you . You 've all helped me . Thank you . " The policemen came , apologizing effusively for how dirty their flesket was , that it was the only one in the station , and please take a seat . They did not take him to the station ; rather they took him to a pad where a flit from the palace waited . The Chamberlain got out . " Yes , it 's him , " he said to the police , and then reached for Ansset 's hand . " Are you all right ? " he asked . " I think so , " Ansset said , suddenly aware that something might be wrong with him . He was inside the flit ; the doors closed ; the ground seemed to push up on him and he was airborne , heading for the palace . For Mikal.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I really do n't give a damn , " said the Chamberlain . " And Mikal is also impatient . " The Chamberlain said nothing , just stared back at the Captain . " All I 'm saying , Chamberlain , is that we have to hurry . " The Chamberlain sighed . " I know . But the child 's a monster . Iwas married once , you know . " The Captain had n't known , but did not care . He shrugged . " I had a boy . When he was eleven he was mischievous , a little devil , but so transparent you could see through him no matter how he tried to deceive . Even when he tried to conceal his feelings , you could tell exactly what he was trying to conceal . But this boy . " " They train them to school their emotions in the Songhouse , " the Captain said . " Yes , the Songhouse . I marvel at their teaching . The child can hide any emotion he wants to . Even his impatience  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But you have hypnotized him . " " Only with the aid of drugs . And when I start mucking around in his mind , Captain , what do I find ? " " Walls . " " Walls . Someone has built blocks in his mind that I ca n't get through . " The Captain smiled . " And you insisted on conducting the interrogationyourself . " The Chamberlain glared . " To be frank , Captain , I did n't trust your men . It was your men who were supposed to be guarding him that day . " It was the Captain 's turn to get angry . " And you know who orderedthem to keep completely out of sight ! They watched the whole thing through ops and could n't get there before they had taken him off underwater . The whole search was just a second too late all the way ! " " That 's the problem , " the Chamberlain said . " A second too late . " " You 've failed at the interrogation ! Mikal wants his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chamberlain glowered a moment , then turned away . " Allp110right . And much as it pains me to say so , I honestly hope you suc-ceed . " The Captain found Ansset sitting on the edge of a couch that flowed aimlessly around him . The boy looked up at him without interest . " Again , " the Captain said . " I know , " Ansset said . The Captain had brought a tray of syringes and slaps . As he prepared the first slap , he talked to Ansset . Trying , he supposed , to put the boy at ease , though whether the boy was nervous or not was impossible to tell . " You know that Mikal wants to see you . " " And I want to see him , " Ansset said . " But you were held for five months by someone who was probably not a friend of the emperor . " " I 've told you everything I know . " " I know it . We have recordings . I think we know everything about what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat spoke to you . You 're a marvelous mimic . Our experts are studying the accentof the crew right now . Your memory of the faces has our artists busy reconstructing them . Everything you 've told us has been in perfectdetail . You 're an ideal witness . " Ansset showed no emotion , not even a sigh . " Yet we go through this again . " " The trouble is , Ansset , what went on during the days . You have blocks  --  2 " " The Chamberlain 's told me . I knew it already . " " And we must get behind them . " " I want you to . You have to believe me , " Ansset said . " I want to know . I do n't want to be a threat to Mikal . I 'd rather die than harm him . But I 'd also rather die than leave him . " The words were strong . The voice was flat and empty . Not even a song in it . " Is that because of a commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ansset looked at him . " Captain . The Songhouse would accept me back at any time . " " Ansset , one of the reasons we ca n't get through the blocks in your mind is because you are n't helping . " " I 'm trying to . " " Ansset , I do n't know how to say this . Most of the time your voice is natural and human and you react like any other person might . But now , when we need to communicate with you more than ever before ,  |p111you  are frozen . You 're completely unreachable . You have n't shown an emotion since I came in here . " Ansset looked surprised . The very fact of even that mild reaction made the Captain 's breath quicken in excitement . " Captain , are n't you using drugs ? " " The drugs are the last resort , Ansset , and you can still resist them . Perhaps whoever put the blocks in your mind gave you help in resisting them . The drugs can only get us partway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way . " Ansset regarded him a little more , as if digesting the information . Then he turned away , and his voice was husky as he said , " What you 're asking me to do is lose Control . " The Captain knew nothing of Control . He only heard control , and did not understand the difficulty of what he was asking . " That 's right . " " And it 's the only way to find out what 's been hidden in my mind ? " " Yes , " said the Captain . Ansset was silent a moment more . " Am I really a danger to Mikal ? " " I do n't know . Perhaps whoever took you found you as hard to cope with as we have . Perhaps there 's nothing hidden in your mind , except a memory of who the kidnappers were . Perhaps they had meant to hold you for ransom , then realized they 'd never get away with it alive and spent the rest of the time trying to conceal who they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks are instructions for you to kill Mikal . If they wanted to pick a perfect assassin , they could n't do better than you . No one but you sees Mikal every day in intimate circumstances . No one has his trust . The very fact that he pleads with us to bring you to him , to hurry the interrogationand let him see you  --  You can see what a danger you might be to him . " " For Mikal 's sake , then , " Ansset said . And the Captain was astoundedby how quickly Ansset 's Control broke . " Tell Mikal , " said Ansset , as his face twisted with emotion and tears began to flow , " that I 'll do anything for him . Even this . " And Ansset wept , great sobs wracking his body , weeping for the months of fear and guilt and solitude . Weeping at the knowledge that he might never see Mikal again . The Captain watched , incredulous , as for an hour Ansset could not communicate at all , just lay on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew that from the observationstations the other interrogators would be watching in awe atp112how quickly the Captain had broken through barriers that even drugs had not been able to breach . The Captain felt a delicious hope that the Chamberlain had been watching , too . And then Ansset became relatively calm , and the Captain began the questioning , using every clever trick he could think of to get behind the barriers . He tried every indirection he had ever heard of . He tried all the dazzling thrusts that had shattered walls before . But even now , with Ansset cooperating fully , nothing could be done at all . Not even in the deepest trance was Ansset able to speak what had been hidden in his mind . The Captain learned only one thing . He asked , while questioning around the skirts of one block , " Who placed this barrier here ? " And Ansset , so deep in the trance that he could hardly speak , said , " Esste . " The name meant nothing to the Captain at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he and the Chamberlain stood before Mikal . " Esste , " Mikal said . " That 's what he said . " " Esste , " Mikal said , " is the name of the Songmaster of the High Room . His teacher in the Songhouse . " " Oh . " " These blocks you have so lovingly spent four days trying to break were placed there years ago by his teachers ! Not by kidnappers only in the last few months ! " " We had to be sure . " " Yes , " Mikal said . " You had to be sure . And we 're not sure now , of course . If the barriers were placed in his mind by his teacher , why ca n't he remember how he spent his days during his captivity ? We can only conclude that some blocks come from the Songhouse , and some blocks from his captors . But what can we do about it ? " " Send the boy back to the Songhouse , " said the Chamberlain . Mikal 's face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but dared not say what he would say if he surrendered himself to passion that much . So he did not shout , but after a moment of struggle said , " Chamberlain , that 's a suggestion I will not hear again . I know it may be necessary . But as for now , I will have my Songbird with me . " " My Lord , " the Captain said , " you 've stayed alive all these years by not taking such chances . " " Until Ansset came , " Mikal answered painfully , " I did not know what I was staying alive for . " The Captain bowed his head . The Chamberlain thought of an/other argument , almost said something , and then thought better of it . " Bring him to me , " said Mikal , " in open court , so that everyone can watch me accept my Songbird again . I 'll have no taint on him . In two hours . " They left , and Mikal sat alone on the floor in front of his fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting old , and his back hurt , and he tried to hum a tune the Songbird had often sung . The voice was old and creaky , and he could n't do it . The fire spat at him , and he wondered what it would be like to have beautiful Ansset hold a laser and aim it at his heart . He would not know what he was doing , Mikal reminded himself . He would be innocent in his heart . But I would still be dead when he was through . The Captain and Chamberlain came together to take Ansset from the cell where he had spent the last four days . " He wants you to come . " Ansset had Control again . He showed little emotion as he asked , " Am I ready ? " They said nothing for a moment , which was answer enough . " Then I wo n't go , " Ansset said . " He commands it , " the Chamberlain said . " Not if we do n't know what 's been hidden in my head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal attitude . But the only thing we could find was that at least some of the blocks were laid by your teacher . " " Esste ? " " Yes . " Ansset smiled , and suddenly his voice radiated confidence . " Then it 's all right . She wishes nothing but good for Mikall " " Only some of the blocks . " And the smile left Ansset 's face . " But you will come . He 's expecting you in court in less than two hours . " " Ca n't we try again ? " " Trying again would be pointless . Whoever laid the blocks in your mind laid them well , Ansset . And Mikal wo n't be put off any longer . You have no choice . Please come with us now . " And the Captainp114stood . He expected to be obeyed , and Ansset followed . They wound their way through the palace to the security rooms at the entrances to the court . There Ansset insisted on their most thorough search , every possible poison and weapon checked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mikal would n't stand for it , " the Captain said , but the Chamberlainnodded and said , " The boy 's right . " So they clamped manaclesonto Ansset 's forearms . The manacles quickly fit snugly from elbow to wrist . They were held by metal bars exactly twenty centimetersapart behind his back , which was uncomfortable at first and steadily more uncomfortable the longer he had to hold the position . They also hobbled his legs . " And keep guards with lasers far enough from me that there 's no chance of my taking a weapon . " " You know , " said the Captain , " that we might still find your kidnappers . We 've identified the accent now . Eire . " " I 've never heard of the planet , " said the Chamberlain . " It 's an island . Here on Earth . " " Another group of freedom fighters ? " asked the Chamberlain , scornfully . " With more gall than most . " " An accent is n't much to go on . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with finality . " It 's time , " said a servant at the door . They left the security room and passed through the ordinary securitysystem , detectors that scanned for metal and the more ordinary poisons , guards who frisked everyone , including Ansset , because they had been told to make no exceptions . And then Ansset passed between the doors and walked into the great hall . When the students had visited , most of the hall had been empty , their chairs gathered up near the throne . Now the full court was in session , with visitors from dozens of planets waiting along the edges of the room to present their petitions or make gifts or complainabout some government policy or official . Mikal sat on his throne at the end of the room . He needed nothing more than a simpleif elegant chair  --  no raised platform , no steps , nothing but his own bearing and dignity to raise him above the level of everyone around him . Ansset had never approached the throne from this end of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the back , and now he knew why so many who walked up this long space were trembling when they reached the end . Every eye was upon him as he passed , and Mikal watched him gravely from thep115throne . Ansset wanted to run to him , embrace him , sing songs , and find comfort in Mikal 's acceptance . Yet he knew that in his mind might hide instructions to kill the old man on the throne . He came within a dozen meters of the throne and knelt , bowing his head . Mikal raised his hand in the ritual of recognition . Ansset had heard Mikal laugh at the rituals when they were alone together , but now the majesty of set forms helped Ansset maintain his calm . " My Lord , " said Ansset in clear , bell-like tones that filled the room and stopped all the whispered conversations around the walls . " I am Ansset , and I have come to ask for my life . " In the old days , Mikal had once explained to Ansset , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had meant something . Many a rebel lord or soldier had died on the spot , when the sovereign denied the petition . And even Mikal took the pro forma surrender of life seriously . It was one of many constant reminders he used to help his subjects remember that he had power over them . " Why should I spare you ? " Mikal asked , his voice old but firm . To anyone else , he would have seemed a model of poise . But Ansset knew the voice , and heard the quaver of eagerness , of fear and gentle trembling on the edges of the tones . The ritual required Ansset to simply state his accomplishments , something modest yet impressive . But Ansset left the ritual here , and fervently sang to Mikal , " Father Mikal , you should not ! " The crowd around the walls began whispering again . The sight of the Songbird in manacles and hobbled was shocking enough . But for the Songbird to plead for his own death --  " Why not ? " Mikal asked , seeming impassive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Do n't push , do n't force me " ) . " Because , my Lord Mikal Imperator , things were done to me that are now locked in my mind so that neither I nor anyone can find them . I therefore have secrets from you . I 'm a danger to you , Father Mikal ! " Ansset deliberately broke with formality in his last sentence , and the threat in his voice struck fear in everyone in the room . " None of that , " Mikal said . " You think you 're acting for my good , but you do n't know my good . Do n't try to teach me to fear you , because I will not . " He raised his hand . " I grant you your life . " And Ansset , despite the strain it caused on his bound arms , leaned down and kissed the floor to express his gratitude for Mikal 's clemency . It was a gesture that only pardoned traitors used . " Why are you bound ? " asked Mikal . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikal said . But Ansset noticed with relief that the Captain of the guard disarmed the men who came out to untie the hobble and break open the manacles . When they were removed , Ansset stood . He raised his now-free arms over his head , lifted his gaze to the great vaults of the ceiling , and sang his love for Mikal . But the song was full of warning , though there were no direct words , and the song also sang of Ansset 's regret that because of Mikal 's wisdomand for the sake of the empire Ansset would now be sent away . " No ! " cried Mikal , interrupting the song . " No ! My Son Ansset , I wo n't send you away ! I would rather meet death at your hands than receive gifts from any other 's . Your life is more valuable to me than my own . " And Mikal reached out his arms . Ansset came to him , and embraced him before the throne , and together they left the hall , with Iegend already growing behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mikal had called his SongbirdMy Son Ansset ; the embrace would be pictured in every newspaper ; storytellers would repeat over and over again the words , " Your life is more valuable to me than my own . " The door to Mikal 's private room closed , and Ansset stood only a few steps into the room . Mikal was ahead of him , stopped , looking at nothing , his back to Ansset . " Never again , " Mikal said . The voice was husky with emotion , and the back was bent . Mikal turned around and faced Ansset , and it shocked the boy how old Mikal 's face had become . The creases were deeper , and the mouth turned more sharply down , and the eyes were deep with pain . They lay in the sunken sockets like jewels in dark velvet , and Ansset suddenly realized that Mikal might someday die . " Never again , " Mikal said . " This can never happen again . When you pleaded with me for freedom from guards and rules and schedules , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Songbird ca n't be caged . ' To me , to my friends , you 're a beautiful melody in the air . To my enemies , who far outnumber my friends , you 're a tool . The very taking of you might have killed me , Ansset . I 'm not young . I ca n't take such things . " " I 'm sorry . " " Sorry . How could you have known ? Raised in that damnablep117Songhouse with no exposure to life at all , how could you have known what kind of hate propels the animals who walk on two legs claimingto be intelligent ? I knew . But ever since you came , I 've been a fool . I 've lived for it feels like a thousand years , a million years , and never made so many mistakes as I have since you came . " " Then send me away . Please . " Mikal looked at him closely . " Do you want to go ? " Ansset wanted to lie to him , to say yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't lie to Mikal . " No , " he finally said . " Then there we are . But from now on , you 'll be guarded . It 's toodamned late , but we 'll watch you and you 'll let me and my men protectyou. " ayes : , " Sing to me , dammit ! Sing to me ! " And Mikal strode across the floor , lifted the eleven-year-old boy in his arms , carried him to the fire , and held him as Ansset began to sing . It was a soft song , and it was short , but at the end of it Mikal was lying on his back looking at the ceiling . Tears streamed out from his eyes . " I did n't mean the song to be sad . I was rejoicing , " Ansset said . " So am I. " Mikal 's hand reached out and gripped Ansset 's . " How was I to know , Ansset , how was I to know that now , in my dotage , I 'd do the foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've loved like I 've done every other passionate thing , but when they took you I discovered , my Son , that I need you . " Mikal rolled over and looked at Ansset , who was gazing at the old man adoringly . " Do n't worship me , boy , " Mikal said . " I 'm an old bastard who 'd kill his mother if one of my enemies had n't already done it . " " You 'd never harm me . " " I harm everything I love . " His face relaxed from bitterness into the memory of fear . " We were afraid for you . At first we were afraid you were another victim of this madman who 's been terrorizing the citizens . The audacity of it was incredible . I expected to learn they 'd found your body torn to pieces -- - " His voice broke . " But then we did n't , and we did n't , and we kept finding more and more bodies , but none of them was yours . We even had to fingerprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was you and we realized that whoeverhad taken you had picked his time well . We had wasted weeks trying to fit you in with the other kidnappings , and by the time we realized that was all wrong , the trail was cold . There were no ransom notes . Nothing . I lay awake at night , hours on end , wondering what they were doing to you . "  | " I 'm all right . " " You 're still afraid of them . " " Not of them , " Ansset said . " Of me . " Mikal sighed and turned away . " I 've let myself need you , and now the worst thing anyone can do to me is take you away . I 've grown weak . " And so Ansset sang to him of weakness , but in his song that weaknesswas the greatest strength of all . Late in the night , when Ansset had thought Mikal was drifting off to sleep , the old emperor flung out his hand and cried in fury , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My empire . Did I build it to fall ? Did I burn over a dozen worlds and ravage a hundred others just to have the whole thing fall in chaos when I die ? " He leaned close to Ansset and whispered to him , their eyes only centimeters apart , " They call me Mikal the Terrible , but I built it all so it would stand like an umbrella over the galaxy . They have it now : peace and prosperity and as much freedom as their little minds can cope with . But when I die they 'll throw it all away . " Ansset tried to sing to him of hope . " There 's no hope . I have fifty sons , three of them legitimate , all of them fools who try to flatter me . They could n't keep the empire for a week , not all of them , not any of them . There 's not a man I 've met in all my life who could control what I 've built in my lifetime . When I die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank to the floor wearily . For once Ansset did not sing . He reached out to touch Mikal , rested his hand on the old man 's knee , said , " For you , Father Mikal , I 'll grow up to be strong . Your empire will not fall ! " He spoke so intenselythat both he and Mikal , after a moment 's surprise , had to laugh . " It 's true , though , " Mikal said , tousling Ansset 's hair . " For you I 'd do it , I 'd give you the empire , except they 'd kill you . And even if I lived long enough to train you to be a ruler of men , to put you on the throne and force them to accept you , I would n't do it . The man who will be my heir must be cruel and vicious and sly and wise , completelyselfish and ambitious , contemptuous of all other people , brilliantin battle , able to outguess and outmaneuver every enemy , and strong enough inside himself to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even I do n't fit my list of qualifications , because now I 'm not alone . "  | " Neither , " said Ansset , " am I. " And he sang Father Mikal to sleep . And as he lay in the darkness , Ansset wondered what it would be like to be emperor , to speak and have his words obeyed , not just by those close enough to hear , but by billions of people all over the universe . He imagined great crowds of people moving to his song , and worlds moving in their paths around their suns according to his word , and the very stars moving left or right , near or far as he wished it . His imaginings became dreams as he drifted off to sleep , and he felt the exhilaration of power as if he were flying , the whole of Susquehanna spread below him , but at night , with the lights shining like stars . Beside him someone else was flying . The face was familiar , but he did not remember why . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at Ansset placidly , but then reached out and touched Ansset , and suddenly Ansset was naked and alone and afraid , and the man was fondling his crotch , and Ansset did n't like it and struck out at the man , struck out with all the power of an emperor , and the sergeant fell from the air with a look of terror , fell and was smashed on one of the towers of the palace . Ansset stared at the broken body , the crumpled , bleeding body , and he suddenly felt the terrible weight of responsibility . He looked up , and all the stars were falling , all the worlds were plunging into their suns , all the crowds were marching over a huge and terrible cliff , and however much he wept and cried out for them to stop , they would not listen ; until his own screaming woke him up , and he saw Mikal 's kind face looking at him with concern . " A dream , " Ansset said , not really awake . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mikal answered . " Do n't ever be . " It was dark , and Ansset slept again quickly . If the Freemen of Eire had not been guilty , would they have fired on the first imperial troops to come questioning them at their supposedlysecret base in Antrim ? Some said not . But the Chamberlain said , " It 's too stupid to believe . " The Captain of the guard held his temper . " It all fit . The accent pinpointed them to Antrim . Seventeen members of the group hadp120been in Eastamerica for one reason or another during most or all of the time Ansset was kidnapped . And they opened fire the moment they saw the troops . " " There is n't a nationalist group that would n't have opened fire . " " There are many nationalist groups that have n't . " " Too convenient , I think , " the Chamberlain insisted , not looking at Mikal because he had long since learned that looking at Mikal did not help at all to persuade him . " Every damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ! " " They started killing themselves , when they saw they would lose . " " And I think that Ansset is still a danger to Mikal ! " " I 've found the conspiracy and destroyed it ! " And then silence , as Mikal considered . " Has Ansset been able to recognize any of the men you killed ? " The Captain turned a little red in the face . " There was a fire . Few of the bodies were recognizable . I showed him pictures , and he thinks that two or three might have been --  " " Might have been , " scoffed the Chamberlain . " Might very well have been members of the crew on the ship . I did the best I could . I command fleets , dammit , not small mop-up crews ! " Mikal looked at him coldly . " Then , Captain , you should have let someone command who knew what he was doing . " " I wanted to make  --  to make sure there were n't any mistakes . " Neither Mikal nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's done is done , " said the Chamberlain . " But I do n't think we ought to get complacent . The enemy was clever enough to get Ansset in the first place and keep him for five months where we could n't find him . I suspect that even if some or all of the crew were Freemen of Eire , the conspiracy did n't originate with them . They were too easy to find . From the accent . Remember , the kidnapper was able to hide every single day from Ansset 's memory and our best probing . If he had n't wanted us to find the Freemen , he would have blocked those memories , too . " The Captain was not one to cling to defeated arguments . " You 're exactly right . I was taken in . " " So were we all , at one time or another , " Mikal said , which did much to ease the Captain 's discomfort . " You may leave , " Mikal told him , and the Captain bowed his head and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meeting room , except for the three trusted guards who watched every movement . " I 'm concerned , " said Mikal.  | " And so am I. " " No doubt . I 'm worried because the Captain is not a stupid man , and he has been behaving stupidly . I assume you 've been having men follow him ever since he was appointed . " The Chamberlain tried to protest . " If you have n't been following him , you have n't been doing a very good job . " " I 've been having him followed . " " Get the records and correlate them with Ansset 's kidnapping . See what you find . " The Chamberlain nodded . Waited a moment , and then , when Mikal seemed to have lost interest in him , got up and left . When Mikal was alone ( except for the guards , but he had learned to dismiss them from his mind , except for the constant watch against an unwary word ) , he sighed , stretched his arms , heard his joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hundred years old . " Where 's Ansset ? " he asked , and one of the guards answered , " I 'll get him . " " Do n't get him . Tell me where he is . " And the guard cocked his head , listening to the constant stream of reports coming into his ear implant . " In the garden . With three guards . Near the river . " " Take me to him . " The guards tried not to betray their surprise . Mikal had n't gone outside the palace in years . But they moved efficiently , and with five guards and an unseen hundred more patrolling the garden , Mikal left the palace and walked to where Ansset sat on the riverbank . Ansset arose when he saw Mikal coming , and they sat together , the guards many meters off , watching carefully , as imperial flits passed overhead . " I feel like an invader , " Mikal said . " I have to take two guards with me when I take a shit . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen . " Mikal listened for a while , but his ear was not so finely timed as Ansset 's , and he grew impatient . " There are plots within plots , " Mikal said . " Sing to me of the plans and plots of foolish men . " So Ansset sang to him a story he had heard only a few days before from a biochemist working in poison control . It was about an ancientresearcher who had finally succeeded in crossing a pig with a chicken , so that the creature could lay ham and eggs together , savingp122a great deal of time at breakfast . The animals lay plenty of eggs , and they were all the researcher had hoped they 'd be . The trouble was , the eggs did n't hatch , so the animal could n't reproduce . The bluntsnoutedpickens ( or chigs ? ) could n't break the eggs , and so the experimentfailed . Mikal was amused , and felt much better . " But you know , Ansset , there was a solution . He should have taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikal 's face soon grew sour again , and he said , " My days are numbered , Ansset . Sing to me of numbered days . " For all his attempts , Ansset had never understood mortality in the way the old understand it . So he had to sing Mikal 's own feelings on the matter back to him . They were no comfort at all . But at least Mikal knew that he was understood , and he felt better as he lay in the grass , watching the Susquehanna rush by . " We have to take Ansset along . He 's the only one who might recognizeanyone . " " I wo n't have any chance of Ansset being taken away from me again . " The Chamberlain was stubborn on this point . " I do n't want to leave it to chance . There are too many ways evidence can be de-stroyed . " Mikal was angry . " I wo n't have the boy caught up in any more of this . He came to Earth to sing , dammit ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlain said . " I ca n't accomplish the tasks you set for me if you tie my hands ! " " Take him , then . But you 'll have to take me , too . " " You ? " " me . " " But the security arrangements --  " " Damn the security arrangements . Nobody expects me to be along on something like this . Surprise is the best security of all . " " But , my Lord , you 'd be risking your life --  " " Chamberlain ! Before you were born I had risked my life in far more dangerous circumstances than these ! I bet my own life that I could build an empire and I damn near lost the bet a hundred times . We 're leaving in fifteen minutes . " " Yes , my Lord , " said the Chamberlain . He left quickly , to get ev/erything ready , but as he walked out of Mikal 's room , he was trembling . He had never dared argue with the emperor that way before . What had he been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . If anything happened to Mikal while he was in the Chamberlain'scare , the Chamberlain was doomed . No one would agree on anything after Mikal 's death except that the Chamberlain must die . Mikal and Ansset came to the troop flesket together . The soldiers were petrified about going on an operation with the emperor himself . But the Chamberlain noticed that Mikal was buoyant , excited . Probablyremembering the glories of past days , the Chamberlain supposed , when he had conquered everybody . Well , he 's not much of a conqueror now , and I wish to hell he had let me handle this . One of the dangers of being so close to the center of power  --  one had to accept the whims of the powerful . The child , however , seemed to feel nothing at all . It was n't the first time the Chamberlain had envied Ansset his iron self-control . The ability to hide every feeling from one 's enemies and friends  --  the group was often undistinguishable  --  would be a greater weapon than any number of lasers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high speed , which took it over the normal river traffic . They reached Hisper in an hour , then went another hour beyond , left the river , and crossed farmland and marshes until they reached a much broader river . " The Delaware , " the Chamberlain whispered to Mikal and Ansset . Mikal nodded , but said , " Keep your esoterica to yourself . " He sounded irritable , which meant he was enjoying himself immensely . It was n't long before the Chamberlain had the lieutenant pull the flesket to the shore . " There 's a path here that leads where we want to go . " The ground was soggy and two soldiers led the column along the path , finding firm ground . It was a long walk , but Mikal did not ask them to go slowly . The Chamberlain wanted to stop and rest , but did not dare ask the column to halt . It would be too much of a victory for Mikal . If the old man can keep it up , thought the Chamberlain , so can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field was a group of farmhouses . The nearest house was a colonial revival , which made it about a hundred years old . Only a hundred meters off was the river , and moored to a pile there was a flatboat rocking gently with the currents . " That 's the house , " said the Chamberlain , " and that 's the boat . " The field between them and the house was not large , and it wasp124overgrown with bushes , so that they were able to reach the house without being too easily noticeable . But the house was empty , and when they rushed the flatboat the only man on board aimed a laser at his own face and blasted it to a cinder . Not before Ansset had recognizedhim , though . " That was Husk , " Ansset said , looking at the body without any sign of feeling . " He 's the man who fed me . " Then Mikal and the Chamberlain followed Ansset through the boat . " It 's not the same , " Ansset said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've been trying to disguiseit . The paint is fresh . And there 's a smell of new wood . They 've been remodeling . But is there anything familiar ? " There was . Ansset found a tiny room that could have been his cell , though now it was painted bright yellow and a new window let sunlight flood into the room . Mikal examined the windowframe . " New , " the emperor pronounced . And by trying to imagine the interior of the flatboat as it might have been unpainted , Ansset was able to find the large room where he had sung on his last evening in captivity . There was no table . But the room seemed the same size , and Ansset agreed that this could very well have been the place he was held . Down in Ansset 's cell they beard the laughter of children and a flesket passing on the river , full of revelers singing . " Quite a populatedarea , " Mikal said to the Chamberlain . " That 's why I had us come in through the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you wanted to avoid being noticed , " Mikal said , " it would have been better to come in on a civilian bus . Nothing 's more conspicuousthan soldiers hiding in the woods . " The Chamberlain felt Mikal 's criticism like a blow . " I 'm not a tactician , " he said . " Tactician enough , " said Mikal , letting the Chamberlain relax a bit . " We 'll go back to the palace now . Do you have anyone you can trust to make the arrest ? " " Yes , " the Chamberlain said . " They 're already warned not to let him leave the palace . " " Who ? " Ansset asked . " Who are you arresting ? " For a moment they seemed reluctant to answer . Finally Mikal said , " The Captain of the guard . " " He was behind the kidnapping ? " " Apparently so , " said the Chamberlain . " I do n't believe it , " Ansset said , for he had thought he knew thep125Captain 's voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Chamberlain would n't understand that . It was n't evidence . And this was the boat , which seemed to prove something to them . So Ansset said nothing more about the Captain until it was too late . As prisons went , there had been worse . It was just a cell without a door  --  at least on the inside . And while there was no furniture , the floor yielded as comfortably as the floor in Mikal 's private room . It was hard not to be bitter , however . The Captain sat leaning on a wall , naked so that he could n't harm himself with his clothing . He was more than sixty years old , and for four years had been in charge of all the emperor 's fleets , coordinating thousands of ships across the galaxy . And then to get caught up in this silly palace intrigue , to be the scapegoatThe Chamberlain had plotted it , of course . Always the Chamberlain . But how could he prove his innocence without undergoing hypnosis ; and who would conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Captain knew what no one else alive did  --  that while a serious probe into his mind would not prove that he was at all involved in kidnapping Ansset , it would uncover other things , earlier things , any one of which could destroy his reputation , all of which together would result in his death as surely as if he had capturedAnsset himself . Forty years of unshakable loyalty , and now , when I 'm innocent , my old crimes stop me from forcing the issue . He ran his hands along his aging thighs as he sat leaning against a wall . The muscles were still there , but his legs felt as if the skin were coming loose , saggingaway . A man should live to be a hundred and twenty in this world , he thought . I wo n't have had much more than half that . What had prompted them to imprison him ? What had he done that was suspicious ? Or had there been anything at all ? There must have been something . Mikal was not a tyrant ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful . Had he talked to the wrong peopletoo often ? Had he been in the wrong cities at the wrong time ? Whoever the real traitors were , he was sure the case they had set up against him looked plausible . Abruptly the lights dimmed to half strength . He knew enough about the prison from the other end of things to know that meantp126darkness in about ten minutes . Night , then , and sleep , if he could sleep . He lay down , rested his arm across his eyes , and knew that the fluttering in his stomach would be irresistible . He would n't sleep tonight . He kept thinking  --  morbidly let himself think , because he had too much courage to hide from his own imagination  --  kept thinking about the way he would die . Mikal was a great man , but he was not kind to traitors . They were taken apart , piece by piece , as the holos recorded the death agony to be broadcast on every planet . Or perhaps they would only claim he was peripherally involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less prolonged . But it was n't the pain that frightened him  --  he had lost his left arm twice , not two years apart , and knew that he could bear pain reasonably well . It was knowing that all the men he had ever commanded would think of him from then on as a traitor , dying in utter disgrace . That was what he could not bear . Mikal 's empire had been created by soldiers with fanatic loyalty and love of honor , and that tradition continued . He remembered the first time he had been in command of a ship . It was at the rebellion of Quenzee , and his cruiser had been surprised on planet . He had had the agonizing choice of lifting the cruiser immediately , before it could be damaged , or waiting to try to save some of his detachment of men . He opted for the cruiser , because if he waited , it would mean nothing at all would be saved for the empire . But the panicked cries of Wait , Wait rang in his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been commended , though they did n't give him the medal for months because he would have found a way to kill himself with it . I thought so easily of suicide then , he remembered . Now , when it would really be useful , it is forever out of reach . I will only be paying for my crimes . They do n't realize it , but even though they think they 're setting up an innocent man , I deserve exactly the penalty I 'm getting . He rememberedAnd the lights went outHe tried to sleep and dream , but still he remembered . And remembered . And in every dream saw her face . No name . He had never known her name  --  it was part of their protection , because if a name was never known , it could never be found by the cleverest probe , no matter how hard he tried . But her face  --  blacker than his own , as if she had pure blood descending from the most isolated part of Africa , and her smile , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his eyes and made his head swim . She was supposed to bep127the real assassin . And the night before they had planned to kill the prefect , she had brought him to her house . Her parents , who knew nothing , were asleep in the back ; she had given herself to him twice before he finally realized that this was more than just release of tensionbefore a difficult mission . She really loved him , he was sure of it , and so he whispered his name into her ear . " What was that ? " she asked . " My name , " he answered , and her face looked as if she was in great pain . " Why did you tell me ? " " Because , " he had whispered as she ran her fingers up his back , " I trust you . " She had groaned under the burden of that trust  --  or perhaps in the last throes of sexual ecstasy . Whatever . He would never know . As he left , she whispered to him at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meet me by the statue of Horus in Flant Fisway . " And he had waited by the statue for two hours , then went looking for her and found her house surrounded by police . And the houses of two other conspirators , and he knew that they had been betrayed . At first he thought , had let himself think that perhaps she had betrayed them , and it was to save his life that she asked him to meet her at the time she knew the police would come . Either way , though , even if she was innocent , he read in the papers that she had killed herself as the police came into her house , had blasted her head off with an old-fashioned bullet pistol right in front of her parents as they sat in the living room wondering why the police were coming to the door . Even if she had betrayed the group , she had refused to betray him  --  knowing his name , she had preferred death to the possibility of being forced to reveal it . Scant comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet he had been born on and never returned . Spent a few years , until he was twenty , trying to join rebellions or foment rebellions or even uncover some serious discontent somewhere in Mikal 's not-veryoldempire . But gradually he had come to realize that not that many people longed for independence . Life under Mikal was better than life had ever been before . And as he learned that , he began to understand what it was that Mikal had achieved . And he enlisted , and used his talents to rise in the military until he was Mikal 's most trusted lieutenant , Captain of the guard . All for nothing . All for nothing because of an ambitious civil servant who was having him die , not with honor , as he had dreamed , but in terribledisgrace.  |p128I  deserve that , too , he thought . Because I told her my name . All my fault , because I told her my name . He had been dozing , because the sudden draft of cooler air startledhim into wakefulness . Had they come for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . And there was no light , not even in the hall , if his impression was right and the door was open . " Who is it ? " he asked . " Shhh , " came the answer . " Captain ? " " Yes . " The Captain struggled to remember the voice . " Who are you ? " " You do n't know me . I 'm just a soldier . You do n't know me . But I know you , Captain . I brought you something . " And the Captain felt a hand grope along his body until it found his arm , his hand , and pressed into it a slap with a syringe mounted on it . " What is it ? " " Honor , " said the soldier . The voice was very young . " Why ? " " You could n't have betrayed Mikal . But they 'll get you , I know it . And make you die  --  as a traitor . So if you want it  --  honor . " And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the gathering heat as the door closed and the breeze stopped . The Captainheld death in his hand . But he had n't much time . The soldier was brave and clever , but the prison security system would soon alert the guards  --  had probably already alerted them  --  that someone had broken in . Perhaps they were already coming for him . What if I actually do prove my innocence , he wondered . Why die now , when I might be exonerated and live the rest of my life ? But he remembered what the Chamberlain 's drugs and questions would uncover , and he could see only her black , black face in his mind as he slapped the stick on his stomach , hard , and the impact broke the seal and allowed the chemicals to open his skin to the poison in the syringe . Normally he would have been counting seconds , to take away the drug when the proper dose had been achieved , but this time the only proper dose was everything the syringe might contain . He was still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the door opened and guards rushed in , pulled the syringeoff his stomach and out of his hand , and started picking him up to rush him out of the cell . " Too late , " he said weakly , but they carried him just the same , half-dragged him down a corridor . The Captain 's limbs were completely dead ; he recognized the poison and knew that this was a sign that death could not be delayed , no matterp129what the treatment . They passed through another door , and there he saw the back of a young soldier being forced by three others into an examination room . " Thank you , " the Captain tried to say to the boy , but he could not make enough sound to be heard over the footfallsand the rushing of uniforms through the halls . They laid him on a table and the doctor leaned over him , shook his head , said it was too late . " Try anyway ! " cried a voice that the Captain dimly recognized as the Chamberlain 's . " Chamberlain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard ! " said the Chamberlain , his voice a study in anguish . " Tell Mikal that my death frees more plotters than it kills . " " Do you think he does n't know it ? " " And tell him  --  tell him --  " The Chamberlain leaned closer , but the Captain died not knowingif he had been able to give his last message to Mikal before he was silenced forever . Ansset watched as Mikal raged at the Chamberlain . Ansset knew Mikal 's voice well enough to know that he was lying somehow , that the rage was , at least partly , a sham . Did the Chamberlain know it ? Ansset suspected that he did . " Only a fool would have killed that soldier ! " cried Mikal . The Chamberlain , acting frightened , said , " I tried everythingdrugs , hypnosis , but he was blocked , he was too well blocked --  " " So you resorted to old-fashioned torture ! " " It was one of the penalties for treason . I thought that if I began it he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he died and now we have no hope of discovering --  " " He was blocked , I tell you , what could I do ? " " What could you do ! " Mikal turned away . Ansset heard a hint ofpleasure in his voice . At what ? It was a grim pleasure , certainly , nothing that Mikal could let himself openly rejoice about . " So he got poison to the Captain despite our best efforts . " " At least it proves the Captain 's guilt , " the Chamberlain said . " At least it proves nothing ! " Mikal snarled , turning back to facep130down the Chamberlain 's attempt at brightening the prospects . " You betrayed my trust and failed your duty ! " It was the start of a ritual . The Chamberlain obediently began the next step . " My Lord Imperator , I was a fool . I deserve to die . I resignmy position and ask you to have me killed . " Mikal followed the ritual , but angrily , gracelessly , as if to make sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn right you 're a fool . I grant you your life because of your infinitely valuable services to me in apprehending the traitor in the first place . " Mikal cocked his head to one side . " So , Chamberlain , who do you think I should make the next Captain of the guard ? " Ansset was even more confused . The Chamberlain and Mikal were lying about something , withholding something from each other  --  and now Mikal was asking the Chamberlain for advice on a subject that was absolutely none of his business . And the Chamberlain was actuallygoing to answer . " Riktors Ashen , of course , my Lord . " Of course ? The attitude was impertinent , the very fact of giving advice downright dangerous . The Chamberlain did not do dangerous things . A safe answer would have been to say that he had never given the matter any thought and would n't presume to advise the emperor on such a vital matter . And here he had said of course . Ordinarily , Ansset would have expected Mikal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him for days . But Mikal defied everything Ansset thought he knew about him and simply answered , with a smile , " Why of course . Riktors Ashen is the obvious choice . Tell him in my name that he 's appointed . " Even the Chamberlain , who had mastered the art of blandness at will , looked surprised for a moment . And the Chamberlain 's surprisemade the connection in Ansset 's mind . The Chamberlain had named the one man he definitely did not want as Captain of the guard , sure that Mikal would immediately reject any man the Chamberlainsuggested . Instead , Mikal had chosen him , knowing the man would be the one most independent of the Chamberlain 's influence . And Ansset could n't help but be pleased . Riktors Ashen was a good choice  --  the fleet would approve , of course , because Riktors Ashen 's reputation as a fighter was the best in years . And the empire would approve because Riktors Ashen had proved in the rebellion of Mantrynn that he could deal mercifully with people . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaintsagainst their rapacious planet manager , tried the fellow , and executed him . Along with the leaders of the rebellion , of course , butp131he had governed the planet himself for several months , rooting out corruption in the upper levels of the government and installing local people in high positions to continue the work after he was gone . There was not a more loyal planet in the galaxy than Mantrynn , and no name in the fleet better loved by the common people than that of Riktors Ashen . But more than any of those good reasons for the appointment , Ansset was glad because he knew the man and liked him and trusted him . Esste herself had told him that Riktors Ashen was the man most like Mikal in the universe . And now that Ansset knew Mikal and loved him , that was the highest praise he could think of . While Ansset had reflected on the appointment , the Chamberlain had left , and Ansset was startled out of his reverie by Mikal 's voice . " Do you know what his last words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mikal was talking about the Captain . " He said , Tell Mikal that my death frees more plotters than it kills . ' And then  --  and then he said he loved me . " Mikal 's voice broke . There were tears in his eyes . " Imagine , that cagey old bastard saying he loved me . Did you know that forty years ago he was involved in a conspiracy to overthrow my government ? A pathetic thing  --  his lover betrayed the conspiracy and eventually he grew out of it . He never knew that I knew it . But maybe he was n't lying . Maybe he did love me , after a fashion . " " Did you love him ? " " I damn well never trusted him , that 's for sure . I never trust anybody . Except you . " Mikal smiled at Ansset , roughed his hair . His tone was flippant , but Ansset knew the sorrow that lay behind it . " But love him ? Who can say . I know I feel like hell knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , as much as I could love anybody I suppose I loved him . At least I 'm glad he found a way to die with honor . " Mikal laughed . " Sounds odd , does n't it ? His death leaves the conspiracy covered , and yet I 'm glad of it . Since you came here , Ansset , I 've forgotten my dedication to my own self-interest . " " Then I should leave . " Mikal sighed . " La la la . One of your most boring songs , Ansset , forever singing the same note . " Mikal settled deeply into the chair . It flowed to support his shift of weight . But his face also sagged into a morose expression . " What 's wrong ? " Ansset asked . " Nothing , " Mikal said . " Oh , it does no good to lie to you . Let 's just say I 'm tired and affairs of state get heavier the older I become . "  | " Why , " Ansset asked , to change the subject  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit to himself , " why was the Captainarrested ? How did you know ? " " Oh , that . The Chamberlain 's men had been watching the Captain . He visited that place regularly . He claimed to his friends that he was seeing a woman who lived there . But the neighbors all testified under drugs that a woman never lived there . And the Captainwas a master at establishing mental blocks . Still , it all would have been circumstantial , even the ship being similar , if you had n't identified that man who killed himself there . Husk ? " " Husk . " Ansset looked down . " I do n't like knowing I affirmed the Captain 's destruction . " " It was n't pleasant for anybody . " " At least the conspiracy is broken , " Ansset said , glad for the relief it would bring him from the constant surveillance of the guards . " Broken ? " Mikal asked . " The conspiracy is barely dented . The soldierwas able to get poison to the Captain . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll instruct Riktors Ashen to keep a close watch on you . " Ansset did not try to hide his disappointment from Mikal . " I know , " Mikal said wearily . " I know how it grates on you . But the secrets are still locked in your mind , Ansset , and until they come out , what else can I do ? " The secrets came out the next day . Mikal held court in the great hall , and at his request Ansset stood with the Chamberlain not far from the throne . Sometime in the afternoonMikal would have Ansset sing . The rest of the time Ansset resigned himself to watching the boring procession of dignitaries payingtheir respects to the emperor . They would all be ritually respectfuland solicitous and swear their undying love and loyalty to Mikal . Then they would all go home and report how soon they thought Mikal the Terrible would die , and who might succeed him , and what the chances were for grabbing a piece of the empire . The order of the dignitaries had been carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflated dignity needed puncturing . A minor official from a distant star cluster whose innovations in welfare management had been adopted throughoutp133the empire was officially honored , the first business of the day , and then the real boredom set in . Princes and presidents and satraps and managers , depending on what title had survived the conquest seventy or eighty or ninety years before , all proceeded forward with their retinue , bowing ( and their bows showed how afraid they were of Mikal , or how much they wanted to flatter him , or how proud and independentthey wanted to seem ) , uttering a few words asking for a privateaudience or a special favor , and then backing away to wait along the walls as Mikal put them off with a kind or a curt word . To particularly humiliate the satrap from Sununuway , he was preceded by a delegation of Black Kinshasans attired in their bizarre ancientEarth costumes . Kinshasa insisted , ridiculously , that it was a sovereign nation , though the Chamberlain whispered in Ansset 's ear that they had n't even got their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congo River Valley , while these benighted peasants lived at the southern tip of Africa . Still they thumbed their nose at Mikal , calling their representative an ambassador , and they were so ridiculous that giving them precedence over anyone was a gross insult . " Those toads from Sununuway , " said the Chamberlain , " will be madder than hell . " He chuckled . They were picturesque , after a fashion , their hair piled high with bones and decorations holding it all in place , vast piles of beads across their chests and only the tiniest of loincloths keeping them decent . But picturesque or not , Mikal was bored with them already and signaled for wine . The Chamberlain poured , tasted it , as was the custom , and then took a step toward Mikal 's throne . Then he stopped , beckoned to Ansset . Surprised at the summons , Ansset came to him . " Why do n't you take the wine to Mikal , Sweet Songbird ? " the Chamberlain said . The surprise fell away from Ansset 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikal 's throne . At that moment , however , pandemonium broke loose . The Kinshasanenvoys reached into their elaborate headdresses and withdrew wooden knives  --  which had passed the metal detectors and the frisking  --  andrushed toward the throne . The guards fired quickly , their lasers dropping five of the Kinshasans , but all had aimed at the foremost assassins , and three continued unharmed . They raced on toward the throne , arms extended so the knives were already aimed directly at Mikal 's heart . There were shouts and screams . A guard managed to shift his aim and get off a shot , but it was wild , and the others had exhausted their charges on the first shot . They were strug/gling to recharge their lasers , but knew even as they tried that they would be too late , that nothing would be fast enough to stop the wooden knives from reaching Mikal . Mikal looked death in the eye and did not seem disappointed . But at that moment Ansset threw the wine goblet at one of the attackersand then leaped out in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked the jaw of the first of the attackers . The angle of the kick was perfect , the force sharp and incredibly hard , and the Kinshasan 's head flew fifty feet away into the crowd , as his body slid forward until the wooden knife still clutched in his hand touched Mikal 's foot . Ansset came down from the jump in time to bring his hand upward into the abdomen of another attacker so sharply that his arm was buried to the elbow in bowels , and his fingers crushed the man 's heart . The third attacker paused just a moment , thrown from his relentlesscharge by the sudden onslaught from the child who had stood so harmlessly by the emperor 's throne . That pause was long enough for recharged lasers to be aimed , to flash , and the last Kinshasan assassin fell , dropping ashes as he collapsed , flaming slightly . The whole thing , from the appearance of the wooden knives to the fall of the last attacker , had taken five seconds . Ansset stood still in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his body . He looked at the gory hand , at the body he had pulled it out of . A rush of long-blocked memories came back , and he remembered other such bodies , other heads kicked from torsos , other men who had died as Ansset learned the skill of killing with his hands . The guilt that had troubled him when he awakened in the evenings on the boat swept through him now with greater force than ever , for now he knew why he felt it , what the guilt was for . The searches had all been in vain . The precautions were meaningless . Ansset could not have used a weapon , did not need a weapon  --  Ansset was the weapon that was to have been used against Father Mikal . The smell of blood and broken intestines combined with the emotionssweeping his body . He would have vomited . Longed to vomit . But Control asserted itself  --  it had been instilled in him for such unbearablemoments as this . And he stood , his face an impassive mask , waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . But the Chamberlain was sure . Ansset heard the voice , trembling with fear at how close the assassination had come and how closep135Mikal had been to assassination ever since Ansset had been restored to him , as the Chamberlain shouted , " Keep him under guard . Wash him . Never let him be out of a laser 's aim for a moment . Then bring him to the council chamber in an hour . " The guards looked toward Mikal , white-faced and shaken on the throne , and he nodded to them . Mikal sat staring into the fire , remembering the first man he had ever killed . Mikal had been a mere child , only ten , younger than Ansset  --  no . Must n't think of Ansset . Only ten , and upstairs asleep . It was in the years of terror on the worlds of the Helping Walk , and that night it was their turn . There was no knock on the door , no sound outside , just the crash of the door blowing in , the scream of Mikal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shriek of Mikal 's sister as she awakened across the small room from him . Mikal had not had to wonder what it was . He was only ten , but such things could not be kept from children in those years , and he had seen the women 's corpses , taken apart and strewn along the street ; had seen the male genitals nailed to the walls as the corpse of the man who had owned them leaned below them , leering madly at the fire that had turned his bowels to ashes . The marauders traveled in small groups , and were said to be irresistible , but Mikal knew where the hunting gun was kept and how to aim it true . He found it in his parents ' room , loaded it carefully while his mother kept on screaming downstairs , and then waited patientlywhile two sets of footsteps came up the stairs . He would have only one shot , but if he chose the right moment , it would be enough  - -  the gun was strong enough to shove a charge through one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the stairs . Mikal had no angst at the thought of killing . He fired . The recoil of the gun knocked him down . When he got up , the two men were gone , having tumbled down the stairs . Still his poise did not leave him . He loaded again , then walked carefully to the top of the stairs . At the bottom , two men knelt over the corpses , then looked up . If Mikal had hesitated , they would have killed him  --  lasers are quicker than any projectile , and these men knew how to use them . But Mikal did not hesitate . He fired again , and this time held his ground against the recoil ,  |p136watching  as the two men dropped from the explosion as the shell hit one man in the head . It was a lucky shot  --  Mikal had been aiming for the other man 's belly . It made no difference . Both were dead . Mikal did not know how he would get down the stairs under fire to finish off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that he did n't need to . His father was being held , forced to watch as the secondman began raping his wife . When four of the marauders were suddenly dead , Mikal 's father did n't hesitate to tell the other three , " You have n't got a chance . There are four of them upstairs and anotherdozen outside . " They believed him ; but they were marauders , and so they slit his throat to the bone , and stabbed Mikal 's mother eight times , and only then did they turn their lasers on themselves , knowing that there would be no mercy if they surrendered , not even a trial , just the brief ceremony of tearing them to pieces . Mikal 's father died even as they did . But Mikal 's mother lived . And at the age of ten Mikal became something of a hero . He organized the villages into a strong resisting force , and when the word spread that no marauders could get into that village , other villages pleaded with Mikal to lead them , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of fifteen , he had forced the marauders to accept a treaty that , in essence , kept them from landing on Mikal 's planet , and over the next few years Mikal taught them that he had the power and the will to enforce it . Yet in the moments when he first came downstairs and saw the four men he had killed , saw his father gouting blood through the gaping smile in his throat , saw three charred corpses already stinking of half-cooked meat , saw his mother lying naked on the floor with a knife in her breast , he had felt an agony that powered all his actions ever since . Even remembering that night left him sweating , more than a century later . And at first it had been hate that propelled him , forced him to take a fleet out to the marauders ' own worlds and subdue them , brought him to the head of a strong , tough group of men all older than him and willing to follow him to hell . But somewhere along the way the hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in killing his mother with poison , decades after she had survived the knives  --  he had hated then , surely . Perhaps it was gradual , as the night of death faded into memory and he began to feel the responsibility of caring for the billions of people who depended on him for law , for peace , for protection . Somewhere along the way his goals had changed . He was no longer out to punish the wicked , as he had once thought his mission in life to be . Now he was out to establish peace throughout the galaxy , to protect mankindp137from mankind , even though it meant more bloody was to force the quarreling worlds and nations and leagues of worlds to accept what they all claimed to want . An end to death in battle . I did it , Mikal told himself , staring into the flames . I did it . And yet not well enough . Because after all of this a boy had to stand there tonight with blood on his hands , looking at the corpses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no boy would ever have to do that again . Mikal felt a pain inside himself that he could not bear . He put his hand into the fire until the pain of his body forced the pain of his heart to recede . Then he wrapped the hand , salved it , and wondered why inward wounds could not be so easily healed . " Songbird , " Riktors Ashen said , " it seems that someone has taught you new songs . " Ansset stood among the guards , who all held lasers trained on him . Control kept him from showing any emotion at all , though he longed to cry out with the agony that tore at him inside . My walls are deep , but can they hold this ? he wondered , and inside his head he heard , faintly , a voice singing to him . It was Esste 's voice , and she sang the love song , and that was what allowed him to contain the guilt and the grief and the fear and keep Control . " You must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never , " Ansset started , and then realized that he could not keep on speaking , not and keep Control . " Do n't torture the boy , Captain , " said Mikal from where he sat in a corner of the council room . The Chamberlain launched into his pro forma resignation . " I should have examined the boy 's muscle structure and realized what new skills he had been given . I submit my resignation . I beg you to take my life . " The Chamberlain must be even more worried than usual , Ansset realized , for he had prostrated himself in front of the emperor . " Shut up and get up , " Mikal said . The Chamberlain arose with his face gray . Mikal had not followed the ritual . The Chamberlain 's life was still on the line . " Apparently , " Mikal said , " we 've broken through some of the barrierslaid in my Songbird 's mind . Let 's see how many . "  |p138Ansset  stood watching as Riktors took a packet off the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first one and felt sick . He did not know why they were making him look until he saw the third one and gasped , despite Control . " You know this one , " Riktors said . Ansset nodded dumbly . " Point to the ones you know . " So Ansset pointed to nearly half of them , and Riktors checked them against a list he held in his hands , and when Ansset was through and turned away ( slowly , slowly , because the guards with the lasers were nervous ) , Riktors smiled grimly at Mikal . " He picked every single one kidnapped and murdered after he himself was kidnapped . There was a connection after all . " " I killed them , " Ansset said , and his voice was not calm . It shook as no one in the palace had ever heard it shake before . Mikal looked at him , but said nothing , gave no sign of sympathy . " They had me practice on them , " Ansset finished . " Who had you practice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the box . " Ansset struggled to hold onto the memory that had been hidden from him by the block . Now he knew why the block had been so strong  --  he could not have borne knowing what was hidden in his mind . But now it was in the open , and he had to bear it , at least long enough to tell . He had to tell , though he longed to let the block slide back to hide these memories forever . " What box ? " Riktors would not let up . " The box . A wooden box . Maybe a receiver , maybe a recording . I do n't know . " " Did you know the voice ? " " Voices . Never the same . Not even for the same sentence . The voices changed for every word . I could never find any songs in them . " Ansset kept seeing the faces of the bound men he was told to maim and then kill . He remembered that though he cried out against it , he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they force you to do it ? " Riktors asked , and though his voice was soft , the questions were insistent , had to be answered . " I do n't know . I do n't know . There were words , and then I had to . " " What words ? " " I do n't knowl I never knew ! " And Ansset began to cry . Mikal spoke softly . " Who taught you to kill that way ? " " A man . I never knew his name . On the last day he was tiedp139where the others had been . The voices made me kill him . " Ansset struggled with the words , the struggle made harder by the realization that this time , when he had killed his teacher , he had not had to be forced . He had killed because he hated the man . " I murdered him . " " Nonsense , " the Chamberlain said , trying to sound sympathetic . " You were a tool . " " I told you to shut up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Son ? " Ansset nodded , took a breath , knowing that though he had lost the illusion of Control , still it was the walls of Control that kept him from screaming , from charging a guard and dying in the welcome flame of a laser . " I killed Master , and all of the crew that was there . Some were missing . The ones I recognized from the pictures from Eire . And Husk . But I killed all the rest , they were all there in the room with the table , and all alone I killed them . They fought me as hard as they could , all except Master , who just stood there like he could n't believe that I could be doing what he saw me do . Maybe they never knew what it was I was learning to do on deck . " " And then ? " " And then when they were all dead I heard footsteps above me on the deck . " " Who ? " " I do n't know . The box told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , and the box told me to close my eyes , and I did , and I could n't open them . Then footsteps down the stairs and a slap on my arm and I woke up walking down a street . " Everyone was silent then , for a few moments . It was the Chamberlainwho finally spoke first . " My Lord , it must have been the Songbird 's great love for you that broke through the barriers despite the fact that the Captain was already dead  --  " " Chamberlain ! " Mikal interrupted . " Your life is over if you speak again before I address you . " He turned to Riktors Ashen . " Captain , I want to know how those Kinshasans got past your guard . " Riktors Ashen made no attempt to excuse himself . " The guards at the door were my men , and they gave them a routine check , without any effort to investigate the possibility of unusual weapons in those unusual headdresses . They 've been replaced with more careful men , and the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pleasure . " " My pleasure , " said Mikal , " will be a long time coming . " Ansset was regaining Control . He listened to the songs in Riktors Ashen 's voice and marveled at the man 's confidence . It was as ifp140none of this could touch Riktors Ashen . He knew he was not at fault , knew that he would not be punished , knew that all would turn out well . His confidence was infectious , and Ansset felt just a little better . Mikal gave clear orders to his Captain . " There will be a rigorous investigation of Kinshasa . Find any and every link between the Kinshasanassassination attempt and the manipulation of Ansset . Every member of the conspiracy is to be treated as a traitor . All the rest of the Kinshasans are to be deported to a world with an unpleasant climate , and every building in Kinshasa is to be destroyed and removedand every field and orchard and animal is to be stripped . I want every bit of it on holo , to be distributed throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikal turned to the Chamberlain , who looked petrified with fear , though he still clung to his dignity . " Chamberlain , what would you recommend that I do with my Songbird ? " The Chamberlain was back to being careful . " My Lord , it is not a matter to which I have given thought . The disposition of your Songbirdis not a matter on which I feel it proper to advise you . " " Very carefully said , my dear Chamberlain . " Ansset struggled to keep Control as he listened to their discussion of what should be done with him . Mikal raised his hand in the gesture that , by ritual , spared the Chamberlain 's life . The Chamberlain 's relief was visible , and at another time Ansset would have laughed ; but now there was no laughter in him , and he knew that his own reliefwould not come so easily as it had come to the Chamberlain . " My Lord , " Ansset said , when the conversation paused . " I beg you to put me to death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rituals , " Mikal said . " This is no ritual , " Ansset said , his voice tired and husky from misuse . " And this is no song , Father Mikal . I 'm a danger to you . " " I noticed , " Mikal said dryly . Then he turned back to the Chamberlain . " Have Ansset 's possessions put together and ready for travel . " " I have no possessions , " Ansset said . Mikal looked at him in surprise . " I 've never owned anything , " Ansset said . Mikal shrugged , spoke again to the Chamberlain . " Inform the Songhouse that Ansset is returning . Tell them that he has performed beautifully , and I have marred him by bringing him to my court.  |p141Tell  them that they will be paid four times what we agreed to before , and that it does n't begin to compensate them for the beauty of their gift to me or the damage that I did to it . See to it . See to it all . " Then Mikal turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave like that , turning his back and walking out without so much as a farewell . " Father Mikal , " Ansset called out . Or rather , he meant to call out . But the words came out softly . They were a song , and Anssetrealized that he had sung the first notes of the love song . It was all the good-bye he 'd be able to give . Mikal left without giving any sign that he heard . " They told me you 're not a prisoner , " the guard said . " But I 'm supposedto watch you , me and the others , and not let you do anything dangerous or try to get away . Sounds like a prisoner to me , but I guess they mean I 'm supposed to be nice about it . " " Thanks , " Ansset said , managing a smile . " Does that mean I can go where I want ? " " Depends on where you want . " " The garden , " Ansset said , and the guard nodded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and across the broad lawns to the banks of the Susquehanna . All the way there his Controlreturned . He remembered the words of his first teacher . " When you want to weep , let the tears come through your throat . Let pain come from the pressure in your thighs . Let sorrow rise and resonate through your head . " Everything was a song and , as a song , could be controlled by the singer . Walking by the Susquehanna as the lawns turned cold in the afternoonshade , Ansset sang his grief . He sang softly , but the guards heard his song , and could not help but weep for him , too . He stopped at a place where the water looked cold and clear , and began to strip off his tunic , preparing to swim . A guard reached out a hand and stopped him . Ansset noticed the laser pointed at his foot . " I ca n't let you do that . Mikal gave orders you were not to be allowed to take your own life . " " I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heady with trustworthiness . " I 'd be killed if any harm came to you , " the guard said.  | " I give you my oath that I will only swim . I 'm a good swimmer . And I wo n't try to get away . " The guards considered among themselves , and the confidence in Ansett 's voice won out . " Do n't go too far , " the leader told him . Ansset took off his underwear and dove into the water . It was icy cold , with the chill of autumn on it , and it stung at first . He swam in broad strokes upstream , knowing that to the guards on the bank he would already seem like only a speck on the surface of the water . Then he dove and swam under the water , holding his breath as only a singer or a pearldiver can , and swam across the current toward the near shore , where the guards were waiting . He could hear , though muffled by the water , the cries of the guards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Two of the guards had already thrown off their boots and were up to their waists in water , preparing to try to catch Ansset 's body as it swept by . But Ansset kept laughing at them , and they turned at him angrily . " Why did you worry ? " Ansset said . " I gave my word . " Then the guards relaxed , and Ansset did n't play any more games with them , just swam and floated and rested on the bank . The chill autumn air was like the perpetual chill of the Songhouse , and though he was cold , he was , not comfortable , but comforted . And from time to time he swam underwater for a while , listening to the different sound the guards ' quarreling and laughing made when Ansset was distanced from them by the water . They played at polys , and the leader was losing heavily , though he was a good sport about it . And sometimes , in a lull in their game , Ansset could hear the cry of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguousby the roar of the current in his ears . It was like the muffling of the birdcalls when Ansset had been in his cell on the flatboat . The birds had been Ansset 's only sign that there was a world outside his prison , that even though he was caught up for a time in madness , something still lived that was untouched by it . And then Ansset made a connection in his mind and realized he had been terribly , terribly wrong . He had been wrong and Mikal had to know about it immediately , had to know about it before something terrible happened , something worse than anything that had gone before  --  Mikal 's death . Ansset swam quickly to shore , splashed out of the water , and without any attempt to dry off put on his underwear and his tunic and started off toward the palace . The guards called out , broke up the game , and chased after him . Let them chase , Ansset thought.  | " Stop ! " cried the guards , but Ansset did not stop . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where are you going ! " demanded the first one to reach him . The guard caught at his shoulder , tried to stop him , but Ansset pulled easily away and sped up . " To the palace , " Ansset said . " I have to get to the palace ! " The guards were gathered around him now , and some stepped in front of him to try to head him off . " You were told I could go where I wanted . " " With limits , " the leader reminded him . " Am I allowed to go to the palace ? " A moment 's pause . " Of course . " " I 'm going to the palace . " So they followed him , some of them with lasers drawn , as he entered the palace and began to lead them through the labyrinth . The doors had not been changed  --  he could open any that he had ever been able to open . And as the guards accompanied him through the labyrinth of the palace , they grew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't you know ? " Ansset asked innocently . " I did n't know this corridor existed , how could I know where it leads ! " And some of them speculated on whether they would ever be able to find their way out alone . Ansset did not smile , but he wanted to . They were passing close to the kitchens , the mess hall , the guard rooms , the places in the palace most familiar to them . But Ansset was more familiar , and left them utterly confused . There was no confusion , however , when they emerged in the securityrooms just outside Mikal 's private room . The leader of the guards instantly recognized it , and in fury planted himself in front of Ansset , his laser drawn . " The one place you ca n't go is here , " he said . " Now move , the other way ! " " I 'm here to see Mikal . I have to see Mikal ! " Ansset raised his voice so it could be heard in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . And sure enough one of the doorservants came to them and asked , in his quiet , unobtrusive way , if he could be of service . " No , " said the guard . " I have to see Mikal ! " Ansset cried , his voice a song of anguish , a plea for pity . Ansset 's pleas were irresistible . But the servant had no intention of resisting . He merely looked puzzled and asked the guards , " Did n't you bring him here ? Mikal is looking for him . "  | " Looking ? " the guard asked . " Mikal wants him in his room immediately . And not under guard . " The leader of the guards lowered his laser . So did the others . " That 's right , " the doorservant said . " Come this way , Songbird . " Ansset nodded to the guard , who shrugged and looked away in embarrassment . Then , as the doorservant had suggested , Ansset came that way . Ansset fit right into the madness , his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was n't prepared for Mikal and the Chamberlainand Riktors Ashen , the only others in the room . Mikal was oozing joviality . He greeted Ansset with a handshake , something he had never done before . And he sounded incredibly cheerful as he said , " Ansset , my Son , it 's fine now . We were so foolish to think we needed to send you away . The Captain was the only one in the plot close enough to have given you the signal . When he died , I immediatelybecame safe . In fact , as you proved today , my boy , you 're the best bodyguard I could possibly have ! " Mikal laughed , and the Chamberlain and Riktors Ashen joined in as if they had n't a care in the world , as if they could n't possibly be more delighted with the turn of events . But it was all unbelievable . Ansset knew Mikal 's voice too well . Warnings laced through everything he said and did . Somethingwas wrong . Well , something was wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikal , when I was imprisoned on the flatboatI could hear birds outside . Birds , and that 's all . Nothing else . But when we went down in that boat on the Delaware we heard childrenlaughing on the road and a flesket pass by on the river ! I was never kept there ! It was a fraud , and the Captain died for it ! " But Mikal only shook his head and laughed . The laugh was maddening . Ansset wanted to leap at him , warn him that whoever had made this plot was more clever than they had thought , was still at largeBut the Chamberlain came to him with a bottle of wine in his hand , laughing just as Mikal was , with songs of treachery in his voice . " Never mind that kind of thing , " the Chamberlain said . " It 's a time for celebration . You saved Mikal 's life , my boy ! I brought some wine . Ansset , why do n't you pour it ? "  |p145Ansset  shuddered with memories he could n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then not surprised at all . The Chamberlain held out the full bottle and the empty goblet . " For the Lord Mikal , " the Chamberlain said . Ansset shouted and dashed the bottle to the floor . " Make him keep silent ! " The suddenness of Ansset 's violent action brought Riktors 's laser out of his belt and into his hand . Riktors had come armed into Mikal 's private room , Ansset realized with relief . " Do n't let the Chamberlain speak , " Ansset cried . " Why not ? " Mikal asked innocently , and the laser sank in Riktors'sgrasp ; but Ansset knew there was no innocence behind the words . Mikal was pretending not to understand . Ansset wanted to fly through the ceiling and escape . But the Chamberlain had not stopped . He said quickly , almost urgently , " Why did you do that ? I have another bottle . Sweet Songbird , let Mikal drink deeply ! " The words hammered into Ansset 's brain , and by reflex he whirled and faced Mikal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his mind . But his hands came up against his will , his legs bent , he compressed to spring , all so quickly that he could n't stop himself . He knew that in less than a second his hand would be buried in Mikal 's face , Mikal 's beloved face , Mikal 's smiling faceMikal was smiling at him , kindly and without fear . For years Controlhad come to Ansset to contain emotion . Now it came to express it . He could not , could not , could not hurt Mikal , and yet he was driven to it , he leaped , his hand struck outBut it did not sink into Mikal 's face . Instead it plunged into the floor , breaking the surface and becoming immersed in the gel that erupted from the floor . The impact broke the skin in Ansset 's arm ; the gel made the pain agonizing ; the bone ached with the force of the blow . But Ansset did not feel that pain . All he felt was the pain in his mind as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill Mikal , to kill Mikal . His body heaved upward , his hand flew through the air , and the back of Mikal 's chair shattered and splashed at the impact . The chair shuddered , then sealed itself . But Ansset 's hand was bleeding ; the blood spurted and splashed and skitted across the surface of the gel spreading across the now-lax floor . But it was his own blood , not Mikal 's , and Ansset cried out in joy . It sounded like a scream of agony . In the distance he heard Mikal 's voice saying , " Do n't shoot him . "  |p146And  , as suddenly as it had come , the compulsion ceased . His mind spun as he heard the Chamberlain 's words fading away : " Songbird , what have you done ! " Those were the words that had set him free . Exhausted and bleeding , Ansset lay on the floor , his right arm covered with blood . The pain reached him now , and he groaned , though his song was as much a song of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , had withstood it long enough that he had not killed Father Mikal . Finally he rolled over and sat up , nursing his arm . The bleeding had settled to a slow trickle . Mikal was still sitting in the chair , which had healed itself . The Chamberlain stood where he had stood ten seconds before , at the beginning of Ansset 's ordeal , the goblet looking ridiculous in his hand . Riktors 's laser was aimed at the Chamberlain . " Call the guards , Captain , " Mikal said . " I already have , " Riktors answered . The button on his belt was glowing . Guards came quickly into the room . " Take the Chamberlainto a cell , " Riktors ordered them . " If any harm comes to him , all of you will die , and your families , too . Do you understand ? " The guards understood . They were Riktors 's men , not the Chamberlain 's . There was no love there . Ansset held his arm . Mikal and Riktors Ashen waited while a doctorcame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Riktors spoke first . " Of course you knew it was the Chamberlain , my Lord . " Mikal smiled faintly . " That was why you let him persuade you to call Ansset back here . To let him show his hand . " Mikal 's smile grew broader . " But , my Lord , only you could have known that the Songbird would be strong enough to resist a compulsion that was five months in the making . " Mikal laughed . And this time Ansset heard real mirth in the laughter . " Riktors Ashen , " Mikal said . " Will they call you Riktors the Great ? Or Riktors the Usurper ? " It took Riktors a moment to realize what had been said . Only a moment . But before his hand could reach his laser , which was back in his belt , Mikal 's hand held a laser that was pointed at Riktors 's heart . " Ansset , my Son , will you take the Captain 's laser from him ? "  |p147Ansset  got up and took the Captain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph in Mikal 's voice . But Ansset did not understand . What had Riktors done ? This was the man that Esste had told him was as much like Mikal as any man aliveAnd Mikal had conquered the galaxy . Oh , Esste had warned him , and he had taken only reassurance from it ! " Only one mistake , Riktors Ashen , " Mikal said . " Otherwise brilliantlydone . And I really do n't see how you could have avoided that mistake either . " " You mean Ansset 's strength ? " Riktors asked , his voice still trying to be calm and succeeding amazingly well . " Not even I counted on that . I was prepared to kill him , if I needed to . " The words did not hurt Ansset . He would rather have died than hurt Mikal , and he knew that Mikal knew that . " Then I made no mistakes , " Riktors said . " How did you know ? " " Because my Chamberlain , unless he were under some sort of compulsion , would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on taking Ansset on his stupid military expedition , to dare to suggest your name when I asked him who ought to become the new Captain of the guard . But you had to have him suggest you , did n't you , because unless you were Captain you would n't have been in a position to take control when I was dead . The Chamberlain would be the obvious guilty one , while you would be the hero who stepped in and held the empire together . The best possible start to your reign . No taint of assassination would have touched you . Of course , half the empire would have rebelled immediately . But you 're a good tactician and a better strategist and you 're popular with the fleet and a lot of citizens . I 'd have given you one chance in four of making it . And that 's better odds than any other man in the empire . " " I gave myself even odds , " Riktors said , but now Ansset could clearly hear the fear singing through the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain now , and Ansset knew of no one , except perhaps an old man like Mikal , who could look at death , especiallydeath that also meant failure , without some fear . But Mikal did not push the button on the laser . Nor did he summonthe guards . " Kill me now and finish it , " Riktors said , pleading for an honorabledeath , though he knew he did not deserve it . Mikal tossed the laser away . " With this ? It has no charge . The Chamberlain installed a charge detector at every door to my chambersover fifteen years ago . He would have known if I was armed . " Immediately Riktors took a step forward , the beginning of a rushp148toward the emperor . Just as quickly Ansset was on his feet , despite the bandaged arm , ready to kill with the other hand , with his feet , with his teeth . Riktors stopped cold . " Ah , " Mikal said . " You never had time to learn from the man who taught Ansset ? What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him . All he heard was Mikal 's voice saying , " It has no charge . " Mikal had trusted him . Mikal had staked his life on Ansset 's ability to resist the compulsion . Ansset wanted to weep in gratitude for such trust , in fear at such terrible danger only barely averted . Instead he stood still with iron Control and watched Riktors for any sign of movement . " Riktors , " Mikal went on , " your mistakes were very slight . I hope you 've learned from them . So that when an assassin as bright as you are tries to take your life , you 'll know all the enemies you have and all the allies you can call on and exactly what you can expect from each . " Ansset looked at Riktors 's face and remembered how glad he had been when the tall soldier had been made Captain . " Let me kill him now , " Ansset said . Mikal sighed . " Do n't kill for pleasure , my Son . If you ever kill for pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't you listening ? I 'm going to adopt Riktors Ashen as my heir . " " I do n't believe you , " Riktors said , but Ansset heard hope in his voice . " I 'll call in my sons  --  they stay around court , hoping to be closest to the palace when I die , " Mikal said . " I 'll make them sign an oath to respect you as my heir . Of course they 'll sign it , and of course they 'll all break it , and of course you 'll have them all killed the first moment you can after you take the throne . If any of them is smart at all , he 'll be at the other end of the galaxy by then . But I doubt there 'll be any that bright . When shall we have you crowned ? Three weeks from tomorrow is enough time to wait . I 'll abdicate in your favor , sign all the papers , it 'll make the headlines on the newspapers for days . I can just see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a pleasant picture to retire on . " Ansset did n't understand . " Why ? He tried to kill you . " Mikal only laughed . It was Riktors who answered . " He thinks I can hold his empire together . But I want to know the price . " " Price ? What could you give me , Riktors , that you would n't take as a gift for you yourself anyway ? I 've waited for you for sixty years . Seventy years , Riktors . I kept thinking , surely there 's someone out there who covets my power and has guts and brains enough to comep149get it . And at last you came . You 'll see to it that I did n't build for nothing . That the wind wo n't tear away everything the moment I 'm not there to hold it up . All I want after you take the throne is a house for myself and my Songbird until I die . On Earth , so you can keep an eye on me , of course . And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plagued by all the bastards who 'll try to get my help to throw you out . And when I 'm dead , send Ansset home . Simple enough ? " " I agree , " Riktors said . " How prudent . " And Mikal laughed again . The vows were made , the abdication and the coronation took place with a great deal of pomp , and Susquehanna 's caterers and hotelkeepersbecame wealthier than they had ever dreamed of . All the contenders and pretenders were slaughtered , and Riktors spent a year going from system to system to quell all the rebellions with his own mixture of brutality and sympathy , After the first few planets were at peace , the populace happy and the rebels butchered , most of the other rebellions quelled themselves . It was only the day after the papers announced that Riktors Ashen was coming home when the soldiers appeared at the door of the little house in Brazil where Mikal and Ansset lived . " How can he ! " Ansset cried out in anguish when he saw the soldiersoutside . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , my Son , " Mikal said . " They 're here to kill you ! " " A year was more than I hoped for . I 've had that year . Did you reallyexpect Riktors to keep his word ? There is n't room in the galaxy for two heads that know the feel of the imperial crown . " " I can kill most of them before they could come near . If you hide , perhaps --  " " Do n't kill anyone , Ansset . That 's not your song . The dance of your hands is ugly without the song of your voice , Songbird . " The soldiers began to beat on the door , which , because it was steel , did not give way easily . " They 'll blow it open in a minute , " Mikal said . " Promise me you wo n't kill anyone . No matter who . Please . Do n't avenge me . " " I will . " " Do n't avenge me . Promise . On your life . On your love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The soldiers killed Mikal with a flash of lasers that turned his skin to ashes . They kept firing until nothing but ashes was left . Then they gathered them up . Anssetwatched , keeping his promise but wishing with all his heart that somewhere in his mind there was a wall he could hide behind . Unfortunately , he was too sane . They took twelve-year-old Ansset and the ashes of the emperor to Susquehanna . The ashes were placed in a huge urn and displayed with state honors . Everyone was told that Mikal had died of old age , and no one admitted to suspecting otherwise . They brought Ansset to the funeral feast under heavy guard , for fear of what his hands might do . After the meal , at which everyone pretended to be somber , Riktors called Ansset to him . The guards followed , but Riktors waved them away . The crown rested lightly on his hair . " I know I 'm safe from you , " Riktors said . " You 're a lying bastard , " Ansset said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had n't given my word to a better man than you , I 'd tear you end to end . " " If I were n't a lying bastard , " Riktors answered with a smile , " Mikal would never have given the empire to me . " Then Riktors stood . " My friends , " he said , and the dignitaries present gave a cheer . " From now on I am not to be known as Riktors Ashen , but as Riktors Mikal . The name Mikal shall pass to all my successors on the throne , in honor of the man who built this empire and brought peace to all mankind . " Riktors sat amid the applause and cheers , which sounded like some of the people might have been sincere . It was a nice speech , as impromptu speeches went . Then Riktors asked Ansset to sing . " I 'd rather die , " Ansset said . " You will , when the time comes . Now sing  --  the song Mikal would want sung at his funeral . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone could see him , just as he had stood to sing to an audience he hated on his last night of captivity in the ship . His song was wordless , for all the words he might have said were treason , and would have stirred the audience to destroy Riktors on the spot . Instead Ansset sang a mel/ody , flying unaccompanied from mode to mode , each note torn from his throat in pain , each note bringing a sweeter pain to the ears that heard it . The song broke up the banquet as the grief they had all pretended to feel now burned within them . Many went home weeping ; all felt the great loss of the man whose ashes dusted the bottom of the urn . Only Riktors stayed at the table after Ansset 's song was over . " Now , " Ansset said , " they 'll never forget Father Mikal . " " Or Mikal 's Songbird , " Riktors said . " But I am Mikal now , as much of him as could survive . A name and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you , " Ansset said coldly . " Is there not ? " Riktors said softly . " Were you fooled by Mikal 's public cruelty ? No , Songbird . " And in his voice Ansset heard the hints of pain that lay behind the harsh and unmerciful emperor . " Stay and sing for me , Songbird , " Riktors said . Pleading played around the edges of his voice . " I was placed with Mikal , not with you , " Ansset said . " I must go home now . " " No , " Riktors said , and he reached into his clothing and pulled out a letter . Ansset read it . It was in Esste 's handwriting , and it told him that if he was willing , the Songhouse would place him with Riktors . Ansset did not understand . But the message was clear , the languageunmistakably Esste 's own . He had trusted Esste when she told him to love Mikal . He would trust her now . Ansset reached out his hand and touched the urn of ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you , " he said , meaning the words to hurt . " Nor I you , " Riktors answered . " But we may , nonetheless , feed each other something that we hunger for . Did Mikal sleep with you ? " " He never wanted to . I never offered . " " Neither will I , " Riktors said . " I only want to hear your songs . " There was no voice in Ansset for the word he decided to say . He could only nod . Riktors had the grace not to smile . He just nodded in return and left the table . Before he reached the doors , Ansset spoke to him . " What will you do with this ? " Riktors looked at the urn where Ansset rested his hand . " Therelics are yours . Do what you want . " Then Riktors Mikal was gone . Ansset took the urn of ashes into the chamber where he and FatherMikal had sung so many songs to each other . Ansset stood for ap152long time before the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs back to Father Mikal , and with love he reached out and emptied the urn on the blazing fire . The ashes put the fire out . " The transition is complete , " Songmaster Onn said to Songmaster Esste as soon as the door to the High Room was closed . " I was afraid , " Esste confided in a low melody that trembled . " Riktors Ashen is not unwise . But Ansset 's songs are stronger than wisdom . " They sat together in the cold sunlight that filtered through the shutters of the High Room . " Ah , " sang Songmaster Onn , and the melody was of love for Songmaster Esste . " Do n't praise me . The gift and the power were Ansset 's . " " But the teacher was Esste . In other hands Ansset might have been used as a tool for power , for wealth . Or worse , he might have been wasted . But in your hands --  " " No , Brother Onn . Ansset himself is too much made of love and loyalty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a tool that can not be used for evil . " " Will he ever know ? " " Perhaps ; I do not think he yet suspects the power of his gift . It would be better if he never found out how little like other Songbirds he is . And as for the last block in his mind  --  we laid that well . He will never find his way around it , and so he will never learn or even search for the truth about who controlled the transfer of the crown . " Songmaster Onn sang tremulously of the delicate plots woven in the mind of a child of five , of six , of nine ; plots that could have unwovenat any time . " But the weaver was wise , and the cloth has held . " " Mikal the Conqueror , " said Esste , " learned to love peace more than he loved himself . So will Riktors Mikal . That is enough . We have done our duty for mankind . Now we must teach other little singers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " answered Songmaster Esste , with a smile . " We will teach them to sing of Mikal 's Songbird. "  | " Ansset has already sung that song , better than we could hope to . " They walked slowly out of the High Room as Songmaster Esste whispered , " Then we will harmonize ! " Their laughter was music down the stairs  |p157Kya-Kya  's arms were too thin . She noticed it again as she touched the keys on her computer terminal ; if she ever had to use her arms to lift something quite heavy , they would break . I am not meant to bear burdens , Kya-Kya reminded herself . I do n't look like a substantialperson , which is why I am forced into such insubstantial work . It was a rationalization she had tried before and never more than half believed . She had graduated from the Princeton Government Institute with the fourth highest score in the history of the school ; and when she tried to find work , instead of being flooded with prestigiousjob offers , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information Center in Tegucigalpa and a city manager 's position on some Godforsaken planet she could n't even find on the starmaps . " It 's an apprenticeship , " her adviser had told her . " Do well , and you 'll rise quickly . " But Kya-Kya sensed that even her adviser did n't really believe it . What could she hope to do well in Tegucigalpa ? Her job was in Welfare , the Department of Senior Services , the Office of Pension Payments . And it was n't an imperial office  --  it was planetary . Earth , of all places , which might be the capital of the universe but was still a provincial backwater at heart . If Kya-Kya could once convince herself that she had not been given a better position because of some wrong impression she gave , of weakness or incompetence or undependability , she could then believe that , by her proving that she was strong and competent and dependable , her situation might improve . But she knew better . At the Songhouse it had been the Deafs and , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a second- or third-class role in the community . Here on Earth , it was the young , the female , the gifted.  |p158And  while youth would take care of itself , there was nothing she particularly wanted to do about being female  --  changers were even more heavily discriminated against . And her gifts , the very things that could make her the most valuable to government service , made her an object of envy , resentment , even fear . It was her third week there , and it had finally come to a head today . Her job took , at best , a third of her time  --  when she slacked . So she began to try ( on the assumption that she needed to prove her competence ) to find out more about the system , to grasp the overall function of everything , the way all the data systems linked together . " Who programs the computers ? " she innocently asked Warvel , the head of Pensions . Warvel looked annoyed  --  he did not like interruptions . " We all do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where figures danced across the whole surface , showing him exactly what was going on at every desk in his office . " But who , " persisted Kya-Kya , " set up the way it works ? The first programming ? " Warvel looked more than annoyed . He stared at her intently , then said savagely , " When I want a research project on the subject , you 'll be the person I appoint . But right now your job is taking inflation tables and applying them to classes of pensions for the budget year starting in only six months , and when you 're here at my desk , Kyaren , it means that neither you nor I is doing his job ! " Kya-Kya waited for a few moments , watching the slightly balding top of his head as he played with the numbers on his desk , querying the computer on questioning procedures . She could not understand the violence of his outburst , as defensive as if she had asked him whether it was true he had been castrated in a playground accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still standing there , he reached over and pointed to a spot on his desk where no figures appeared at all . " See that blank spot ? " Warvel asked . " Yes . " " That 's you . That 's the work you 're doing right now . " And Kya-Kya returned to her desk and her terminal and began punching in the numbers with her slender fingers on the end of slenderarms , feeling weaker and slighter than she had ever felt before . It was not just Warvel , not just the work . From the moment she arrived , it seemed that none of her co-workers was interested in makingher acquaintance . Conversations never included her ; in-jokes left her completely in the dark ; people fell silent when she came near ap159table in the lunchroom or a fountain in the halls . At first  --  and still -- she tried to believe that it was because she was young , she was frail , she did not make friends easily . But actually , right from the start , she knew it was because she was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet ; because she was curious and wanted to learn and wanted to be excellent , which would threaten all of them , make them all look bad . Petty bureaucrats with infinitesimal minds , she told herself , jabbingat the keys on the computer . Small minds running a small planet , terrified of someone who smacks of potential greatness  --  or even potential averageness . They had all watched her return to her desk from her interview with Warvel . Even the women had looked her up and down in the contemptuous way they had on Earth , as if the act of surveying her body expressed their opinion of her mind and her heart . There was n't one sympathetic look on anyone 's face . She stopped punching keys and got hold of herself . Think that way , Kyaren , she told herself , and you 'll never get anywhere . Must do my best , must try to be good at it , and hope for a change , hope for some opportunity to shine . Her terminal glowed at her , unwinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , and she could not concentrate on it anymore . And so she punched in her lunchtime , was given clearance  --  there were enough tables open in the lunchroom  --  and left her desk to go eat . The eyes followed her again , and after she left , she could hear the buzz of conversation begin . The office was unbearably silent when she was there ; when she was gone , everyone was friendly . It was in the lunchroom that day that she met Josif . The setting was the good thing about Tegucigalpa . The InformationCenter was almost invisible from the air  --  all the roofs were planted with the same jungle growth that was lush on the hills . But in the complex itself , everything was a miracle of green and glass , huge transparent walls on hundreds of buildings rising twenty or forty or eighty meters into the air . The lunchroom was at the edge , on a slope , where it could overlook much of the rest of the complex  --  even had a view of the village that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or Kyaren , as she had taken to calling herself when she first discovered she was going to work on Earth , in an effort to sound more native  --  took her food from the dispensers and carried it to an empty table , she watched a dazzlingly bright bird float down from the roof of the Income Department and land on a small island in the Chultick River . During its descent , a wild thingp160living in a perfectly wild habitat , the bird had passed in front of the glass windows where dozens of people worked sucking information out of computers , twisting it around , and spewing it back in . A jungle , with electricity manipulated amid the trees to hold all the knowledge of a world . It was because she was watching the bird and thinking of the contraststhat Josif was able to set down his tray unnoticed . Of course , Josif was quiet , too  --  as silent as a statistic , Kyaren would later tell him . But as she watched the bird walking around in a seemingly purposelessdance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned , and there was Josif . Deep but open-seeming eyes , delicatefeatures , and a mouth that perpetually smiled as if he knew the joke and would never tell anyone , because it was n't really funny . " I hear Warvel ate you alive today . " Gossip travels quickly , Kya-Kya thought  --  but could n't help being flattered that this total stranger would even care ; could n't help being pleased that someone was actually speaking to her about something besides business . " I 've been chewed , " Kya-Kya said , " but I have n't been swallowed yet . " " I 've noticed you , " Josif said , smiling at her . " I 've never noticed you , " Kyaren answered , though it was not reallytrue . She had seen him around  --  he worked in Statistics , Departmentof Vitals , Office of Death , which was on the floor below hers . She just had n't cared much . Kya-Kya had been raised in the Songhouse , and the close association of the sexes had somewhat numbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he goodlooking ? Is he beautiful ? She was n't sure . Interesting , anyway . The eyes that looked so innocent , the mouth that looked so world-wise . " Yes you have , " Josif answered , still smiling . " You 're an outcast . " So it was that obvious ; she resented hearing it in words . " Am I ? " she asked . " It 's something we have in common . We 're both outcasts . " It was a line , then , and Kyaren sighed . She had become expert at deflecting Iines  --  bored students had tried many times to spark up a dull evening with attempts at seducing Kya-Kya . Once or twice she had gone along with it . It was never worth the effort . " With that little in common , I doubt we have much of a friendshipahead of us . " She turned back to her food . " Friends ? We should be enemies , " Josif said . " We can help each other , as long as we hate each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up from her lunch . She told herselfthat it was because she was tired of the lunchroom 's attempts at local color  --  Honduran food was wretched . She pushed the food away from her and leaned back in her chair , waiting for him to go on . " You see , " Josif went on , assured of an audience , " while you 're busy rejecting me , you can have the satisfaction of knowing that you 're part of the majority around here . I mean , you may not be in , but you sure as hell know who 's out . " She could n't help it . She laughed , and he cocked his head at her . " So much for the frigid bitch theory , " Josif said . " You should see me in bed , " Kyaren said , joking , and then was appalledto realize that instead of averting his attempt at seduction she had brought up the topic instead . He avoided any of the obvious repartee , however , and changed the subject . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he know ? He could stand in the middle of a war and not know that anything had happened . For him there are n't any events  --  only trends . It 's statistical myopia , a disease endemic to our trade . " " I just wanted to know . How it all works . He blew it up out of proportion . I 'm amazed that the word spread so quickly . " Josif smiled at her , reached out and touched her arm . She did not appreciate the intimacy of the gesture , but tolerated it . " I 'm awfully bored , are n't you ? " he asked . " I mean , bored with the whole busi-ness . " She nodded . " I mean , who the hell cares about any of this ? It 's got to be done , like sewage and teaching children how to read and all that , but no one really enjoys it . " " I would , " Kyaren said . " At least , I would enjoy it at a higher level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punching pension information into a terminal . " " Go up fifteen ranks and they 're still all asses . " " I would n't be , " Kyaren said , then realized she had sounded too intense . Did she really want to confide her ambitions in this boy ? " What are you , immune from asshood ? Anybody who presumes to make decisions about the lives of other people is an ass . " Josif laughed , only this time he seemed embarrassed , made a gesture as if to draw a mask down his face , and , as if he had actually donned a mask , his face went frivolous and innocent again , with any hint of deep feeling gone . " I 'm boring you , " he said.  | " How could you bore me ? You 're the first person to talk to me about anything other than statistics in three weeks . " " It 's because you reek of competence , you know . A week before you got here , everyone heard about your scores on the Princeton examinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Now you say we . You are part of the group , are n't you ? " Josif shook his head , and his face went serious again . " No . But in the opposite direction from you . You they shut out because you 're better than they are , they 're afraid of you . Me they shut out because I 'm beneath contempt . " ' When he said it , it occurred to Kyaren that he believed that assessment of himself . It also occurred to her that if she let this conversationgo on any longer , she would not be able to get rid of this man easily . " Thanks for the company at lunch , " she said . " Actually , though , you need n't make a habit of it . " He looked surprised . " What did I say ? Why are you mad ? " She smiled coldly . " I 'm not . " Her best **45;7529;TOOLONG was enough to freeze a tropical river ; she imagined the icicles forming on his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and instantly regretted it . This was the most human contact she had had in weeks . In years , in fact  --  he seemed more personallyconcerned than anyone she had known at Princeton . And she had cut him off without even learning his name . She did not know he was following her until he caught up with her in the glass corridor that crossed a strip of jungle between the lunchroom and the work buildings . He took her by the arm , firmly enough that she could not easily pull away , but not so firmly that she even wanted to . She did n't slow down , but he matched her pace perfectly . " Are you sure ? " he asked . " About what ? " she answered , coldly again . " About not being friends . I need a friend , you know . Even a coldhearted , suspicious , scared-to-death lady like you . While of course your social life is so full that you 'd have to look months ahead in your appointment book to find an evening you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepared more by reflex than by desire to cut him dead , retrieve her arm , and go back to her office alone . But an inadvertent smile ruined the effect  --  she said nothing , just tried to stifle the grin , and he mimicked her , struggling comically to force his face into a frown and finally failing . She laughed out loud.  | " I 'm Josif , " he said . " You 're Kyaren , right ? " She nodded , trying to get rid of the smile . " Let 's pretend you think I 'm worth having around . Let 's pretend you want to see me tonight . Let 's pretend that you give me your room number , and we go walking in the Zone so that you do n't have to worry about me trying to get you in bed . Let 's pretend you trust me . " She pretended . It was n't hard . " Thirty-two seventeen , " she said . Then he let go of her arm and she went back to her office alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprimand from Warvel forgotten . For the first time since she had first come to Earth , she genuinely liked someone . Not a lot , but enough that spending time with him might even be fun . The idea of having fun appealed to her , though she was not altogether sure what fun felt like . To her surprise , she had only been at her desk for a few minutes when one of her co-workers , a parrot-beaked woman who did actuarialestimates for the population at large , came over to her desk and sat on the edge of it . " Kyaren , " the woman said . " Yes ? " Kyaren asked , suspicious and prepared openly for hostility , though inwardly she hoped vaguely that this would actually be a friendly overture  --  she was in the mood for it , now . " That bastard from Death , Josif . " " Yes ? " " Just a friendly warning . Do n't bother with him . " " Why not ? " Parrot-beak 's expression grew darker  --  she was apparently not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because he 's a whore . " That was so far from her impression of Josif that Kyaren could only look surprised and say , " What ? " " You heard me . " " But  --  he did n't try anything , did n't offer anything . " " Not to you , " the woman said , rolling her eyes impatiently heavenward . " You 're a woman . " And the woman got up and went to her own desk , leaving Kyaren to punch money into the lives of old people while wondering if it was true , insisting that it made no difference , and knowing that the thought of Josif as a homosexual prostitute completely destroyed her delight at the quarter-hour she had spent with him.  |p164She  was tempted not to answer his voice at the door . I 'm not here , she thought . Not to you . But when he spoke a second time , she could n't resist getting up from her bed and opening the door . Just to see him and confirm for herself whether it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grinning . She did not smile back . " One question . True or false . Are you a homosexual whore ? " His face went ugly , and he did n't answer for a moment . Then he said , quietly , " You see ? You do n't have to be one of the in-group to get the dirt on someone else . " He had n't said no , and her contempt for people who sold themselvesbecame dominant . She started closing the door . " Wait a minute , " he said . " You did n't answer my question . " " You asked two questions . " She digested that . " All right then . " " I 'm not a whore , " he said . " And the other just guarantees you 're safe from me tonight , does n't it ? " The whole thing was ugly . Today had been fun , but now she could not think of him except in a sexual context . She knew about homosexuality , of course ; the mental picture she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she could not stop herself from picturing him performing that act . It made him ugly . His slenderness , the delicacy of his face , the innocence in his eyes  --  they becamedeceptive , repulsive to her now . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I just want to be alone . " " No you do n't , " he said . " I know what I want . " " No you do n't . " " Well , if I do n't , you certainly do n't . " " Yes I do . " And he pushed the door open carefully , ducked under her arm , and went inside . " You can get out , " she said . " I can , " he agreed amiably , sitting on the edge of her bed , the only large piece of furniture in her room . She pointedly sat in a chair . " Kyaren , " he said . " You liked me today . " " No I did n't , " she said . And because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't like you at all . You were pushy and obnoxious and your attention was completely unwelcome . " " Come now , we 're statisticians , are n't we ? " he said . " Nothing'sp165complete . Let 's say I was seventy percent obnoxious and you sixty percent did n't want me around . Well , I 'll be here for only ten percent of the night , so there 's plenty of margin . Concentrate on liking me . I mean , I overlooked the fact that you 're as mean as the imperial fleet . Surely you can overlook the fact that I do perverted things . I wo n't do any of them to you . " " Why are you bothering me like this ? " " Believe me , I 'm not trying to be bothersome . " " Why do n't you leave me alone ? " He looked at her a long time before answering , and then tears came into his eyes and his face went all innocent and vulnerable and he said , quietly , " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in this zoo . " " Just think of me , " she said , " as one of the animals . " " I ca n't . " " Why not ? " " Because you are n't . " The way he looked at her , his eyes swimming with tears , was getting through to her . Is it an act ? she wondered . Is this just an incrediblycomplex line ? Then it occurred to her that he was probably not interested in the thing that lines usually led to . " What do you want ? " Perversely , he took the question wrong . Deliberately wrong , Kyaren knew , and yet exactly right . " I want , " he said , " to live forever . " She started to interrupt . " No , I mean -- - " But he refused to be interrupted . He spoke louder , and got up from the bed and walked aimlessly around the limited floorspace of the room . " I want to live forever surrounded by the things I love . A million books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only a single example of the human race in the present . " " Only one person ? " she asked . " Me ? " " You ? " he asked in mock startlement . Then , more subdued , he said , " Why not ? For a while at least . One person at a time . " " All of humanity in the past , " she said . " You like your work in the Office of Death that much ? " He laughed . " History , Kyaren . I 'm a historian . I have degrees from three universities . I 've written theses and dissertations . Feces and defecations , " he amended . " With my specialty , there 's not a chance in the world of my getting a job on this planet . Or a really good job anywhere . " He walked up to her , knelt beside her , and put his head in her lap.  |p166She  wanted to shove him away , but found that she could not bring herself to do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the present . " And he smiled so crazily , reaching up a clawed hand to paw ineffectually at her arm , that she could not stop herself from laughing . He had won . And she knew it . And he stayed , talking . He talked about his obsession with history , which began in the libraryin Seattle , Westamerica , a town on the site of a great ancient city . " I did n't get along with other children , " he said . " But I got along great with Napoleon Bonaparte . Oliver Cromwell . Douglas MacArthur . Attila the Hun . " The names meant nothing to Kyaren , but they obviously were rich with memories to josif . " Napoleon is always in dense forest to me . I read about him among trees , huge trees covering ground so moist you could almost swim in it . While Cromwellis always in a little boat on Pungent Bay , in the rain . The librarymade me pay for the new printout of the book  --  the ink ran on the copy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got old enough to realize that it takes more than dreams to make any kind of impression on events . And a reader of books is not a mover of men . " He was so full of memory , which flooded out of him uncontrollablyand yet in marvelously subtle order , that Kyaren also remembered , though she said nothing of it to him . She had been raised amid music , constant songs ; but here she found a better song than any she had heard on Tew . His cadences , his melodies and themes and variations were verbal , not musical , but because of that they reached her better , and when at last he finished she felt she had listened to a virtuoso perform . She resisted the temptation to applaud . He would have thought she was being ironic . Instead she only sighed , and closed her eyes , and remembered her own dreams when she first became a Groan and thought of one day singing before thousands of people who would watch her intently and admire and be moved . The dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing was left of them but a scar that bled often but never reopened . She sighed , and josif misunderstood . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I thought it would matter to you . " And he got up to go . She stopped him , caught his hand and pulled him away from the door , which was closing again because he had not stepped through it . " Do n't go , " she said . " I bored you . "  |p167She  shook her head . " No , " she said . " You did n't bore me . I just do n't know why you told me . " He laughed softly . " Because you 're the first person in a long time who looked like she might be willing to hear and capable of under-standing . " " Dreams , dreams , dreams , " she said . " You 've never grown up . " " Yes I have , " he said , and the pain in his voice was painful to hear . " Drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's all I have , " she answered . " So it 's a good thing that 's what you want . " She came back in with two glasses , and josif sipped it as reverentlyas if it had been wine dedicated on some altar . His eyes were grave as he said to her , " I cheated . " She raised an eyebrow . " I changed the subject . " " When ? " He had been through many subjects that night . She glanced at her wrist . It had been more than two hours . " Right at the first . I started talking about childhood and dreams and history and my private madnesses . While all you wanted to talk about was perversion . " She shook her head . " Do n't want to talk about it . " " I do . " " No . I 've enjoyed this . I do n't want it wrecked . " He drank the rest of the water quickly . " Kyaren , " he said . " They make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to know if it 's ugly or not . " " They call me a whore , and I was n't . " " I believe you . Let 's leave it at that . " " No , dammit ! " he said fiercely . " What do you think I 've been going through the last couple of hours ? You think I go to parties and tell people my life story ? I 'm attaching to you , Kyaren , like a bloodsuckerto a shark . " " I do n't like the analogy . " " I 'm not a poet . I do n't know what kind of pain you 've gone through in your life to turn you into what you are , but I like what you are , and I want to be with you for a while , and when I do that I do n't just play around at it . I become ubiquitous . You wo n't be able to get rid of me . I 'll be there whenever you turn around . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whenever you feel someone tickling your feet at work it 'll be me , hiding under your desk . You understand ? I plan to stay here . "  | " Why me ? " Kyaren asked . " Do you think I know ? A stuck-up Princeton graduate like you ? " He hazarded a guess . " Maybe because you listened to me all the way through and did n't fall asleep . " " I thought of it a couple of times . " " I came here as Bant 's lover . " " I do n't want to hear this . " " Bant loved me and I loved Bant and he came here and brought me with him because he did n't want to be without me and so he got me a job in Death while he was in charge of Vitals . I did n't want to come here . All I wanted to do was stay near a library and read . For the rest of my life , I think . But Bant came here and I came , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get boring sometimes . " Kyaren decided not to try to be humorous . " I got boring , and so he did n't bring me with him when he transferredover to be head of Employment . And he did n't notify me when he moved to better rooms . But he did n't take away my job . He was kind enough to let me keep my job . " And Josif was crying and suddenly Kyaren understood something that nobody had ever bothered to explain to her in all the explanationsof homosexuality that she had heard . That when Bant left it was the end of the world for Josif , because when he attached to somebody he did n't know how to let go . Yet Kyaren was unsure how to react . Josif was , after all , nearly a stranger . Why had he poured out his heart to her tonight ? What did he expect her to do ? If he thought she was going to respond by baringher soul to him , he was wrong  --  Kyaren kept all her memories hidden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Songhouse . What could she say ? I was miserable for years because I simply did n't have the ability to measure up to the Songhouse 's minimumstandards ? She did n't want pity because of her childhood inabilities . She wanted respect because of her current competence . Respect did n't enter into this situation , with the man crying softly , his face pressed into his knees as he sat on the floor leaning against the bed . She could think of only one reason for his emotional outpouring . He obviously did n't want to seduce her ; therefore , he could only be trying for friendship . She knew how painful her isolationhad been . If his had been half so bad , no wonder he was graspingat the first person who showed any sign of liking him . For that matter , she wondered , why do n't I feel any desire to take hold of his offer of friendship ? Because she did n't quite trust him , she realized . She was instantlyp169ashamed of her suspicions . She knelt and then sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to comfort him . Fifteen minutes later he started undressing her . She looked at him in surprise . " I thought --  " she said , and he interrupted . " Statistics , " he said . " Trends . I 'm sixty-two percent attracted to men , thirty-one percent attracted to women , and seven percent attracted to sheep . And one hundred percent attracted to you . " She had been right to mistrust him , the cynical , beaten part of her mind said sneeringly . It had all been a line . But she clung to the line and let it draw her in . Because there was another part of her that had n't had much play lately : she needed his gentle hands and quiet tears , his lies and his affection . And so she pretended to believe that he really did need her even as she said , " I thought it would come to this , eventually . " She did n't say that she had n't thought that when it happened she would be longing for it , that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of need , that this half-man would be able to do in one night what no one had been able to do in her life  --  win enough of her trust that she was willing , even for a moment , to let herself want him . So she comforted him that night , and , strangely enough , she was also comforted , though she had said nothing to him of her loneliness , had told him nothing of her dreams . As she ran her hands over his smooth skin , she remembered the harsh cold stone of the Songhouseand could not think why the one should have reminded her of the other . " I will tour the empire next year , " Riktors announced at dinner , and the two hundred prefects gathered at the tables cheered and clapped . It struck Ansset , from his place beside Riktors at the table , that the outburst was largely sincere , an unusual event in the palace . Ansset smiled at Riktors . " They mean it , " he said , for Riktors 's ears only . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that he had heard , had understood . And then the tumult died and Riktors said , " Not only will I tour , and visit at least one world in every prefecture , but also I will bring my Songbird with me , so that all the empire can hear him sing ! " And the cheers were even louder , the applause even more sincere . Riktors looked at Ansset and laughed in delight  --  the boy lookedp170completely surprised , and Riktors loved to surprise him . It was n't easy to do . But when the room was quiet again , Ansset said , softly , " But I wo n't be here next year . " Enough people heard him that a whisper began along the head table . Riktors tried to keep his expression bland . He knew immediatelywhat the boy meant . It was something that Riktors had forgottenwithout forgetting . He knew that Ansset was nearly fifteen years old , that the contract with the Songhouse was nearly up . But he had not let himself think of it , had not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Ansset and patted his hand . " We 'll talk about it later , " Riktors said . But Ansset looked worried . He spoke louder this time . " Riktors , " the boy said , " I 'm nearly fifteen . My contract expires in a month . " Some of the prefects in the audience moaned ; most , however , realized that what was being said at the head table was not according to plan . That Ansset was doing what no one dared to do  --  reminding the emperor of something the emperor did not want to know . They kept their silence . " Contracts can be renewed , " Riktors said , trying to sound jovial and hoping to be able to change the subject immediately . He did not know how to react to Ansset 's insistence . Why was the boy pushing the matter ? Whatever the reason , he was still determined to push . " Not mine , " said Ansset . " In a month I get to go home . " And now everyone in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled on the edge of the table . For a moment he refused to understand what Ansset was saying ; but Riktors did not become emperor by indulging his need to lie to himself . Go home , the boy had said . His choice of words had to be deliberate  --  in public Ansset had no inadvertent words . Get to go home , not have to go home , he had said . And suddenly the last few years were all undone ; Riktors felt them unwinding inside him , unraveling , all the fabric turning into meaningless threads that he could not put together however much he tried . There were countless days of conversation , the songs Ansset had sung to him , walks along the river . They had romped together like brothers , Riktors forgetting all his dignity , and Ansset forgetting  --  or so Riktors had believed  --  all the enmity of the past . Do you love me ? Riktors had once asked , opening himself as , withp171any other person , he could not have afforded to open himself . And Ansset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to mean yes . And all the time Ansset was marking time , watching for his fifteenth birthday , for the expiration of his contract , for home . I should have known better , Riktors told himself bitterly . I should have realized that the boy was Mikal 's , would always be Mikal 's , would never be mine . He did not forgive , as I thought he had . Riktors imagined Ansset returning to the Songhouse on Tew ; he pictured him embracing Esste , the hard woman who only looked soft when she looked at the Songbird . Riktors pictured her asking , " How was it , living with the killer ? " And he pictured Ansset weeping ; no , never weeping , not Ansset . He would remain calm , merely sing to her of the humiliation of singing for Riktors Ashen , emperor , assassin , and pathetic lover of Ansset 's songs . Riktors imagined Ansset and Esste laughing together as they talked of the moment when Riktors , weary of the weight of the empire in his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hands , and had wept before the boy sang a note . A weakling , that 's what I 've been , in front of a boy who never shows an unwitting emotion ; he has seen me unprotected , and instead of loving me he has felt only contempt . It was just a moment that Riktors sat there silently , but in his mind he progressed from surprise to hurt to humiliation and , at last , to fury . He rose to his feet , and there was no hiding the anger on his face . The prefects were alarmed  --  it is not wise to witness the embarrassmentof powerful men , they all knew , and no one was so powerful as Riktors Mikal . " You are right ! " Riktors said , loudly . " My Songbird has reminded me that in a month his contract expires and he goes , as he says , home . I had thought that this was his home , but now I see that I was mistaken . My Songbird will return to Tew , to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Songbird , since he obviously holds us in little esteem , will never again see his emperor , and his emperor will never again permit himself to hear his lying songs . " Riktors 's face was red and tight with pain when he turned and left the dinner . A few of the prefects made some small effort to touch their food ; the rest got up immediately , and soon all were headed out of the hall , wondering whether it would be better to stay around to try to show the emperor that they were still as loyal as ever , or to head quickly for their prefectures , so that he and they could all pretend that they had never come , that the scence with Ansset had never taken place.  |p172As  they left , Ansset sat alone at the table , looking at but not seeingthe food in front of him . He sat that way , in silence , until the Mayor of the palace ( the office of Chamberlain had long since been abolished ) came to him and led him away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mayor said nothing , only took him into the maze of corridors . It did not take Ansset long to recognize the place they were going to . When Riktors Ashen changed his name and moved into the palace , he had stayed away from Mikal 's old chambers ; instead he had establishedhimself in new rooms near the top of the building , with windows that displayed the lawns and forest all around . Now the Mayor led Ansset through doors that once had been guarded by the tightest security measures in the empire , and at last they stood inside the door of a room where an empty fireplace still had ashes on the hearth ; where the furniture remained unmoved , untouched ; where the years of Mikal 's presence still clung to all the features of the place , to all the memories the room inevitably stirred in Ansset 's mind . There was a thin layer of dust on the floor , as in all the unused rooms of the palace , which were only cleaned annually , if at all . Anssetwalked slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked to the fireplace ; the urn that had held Mikal 's ashes still waited beside the opening . He turned back to face the Mayor , who finally spoke . " Riktors Imperator , " the Mayor said , with the formality of a meinorizedmessage , " has said to you , Since you were not at home with me , you will stay where you are at home , until the Songhouse sends for you . " " Riktors misunderstood me , " Ansset said , but the Mayor showed no sign of having heard . He only turned away and left , and when Ansset tried the door , it did not open to his touch . They spent weekend after weekend in Mexico , the largest city in the hemisphere . Josif went to make the rounds of bookstores  --  the marketin old books and rare books was always hot , and Josif had an eye for bargains , books selling for way under value . He also had an eye for what he wanted  --  histories that were long out of print , fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaries and jour/nals . " They say there 's nothing original to be said about the history of Earth , that all the facts have been in for years , " Josif said fiercely . " But that was years ago , and now no one remembers anymore . What it was like to live here then . " " When ? " Kyaren asked him . " Then . As opposed to now . " " I 'm more interested , " she always told him , " in tomorrow . " But she was n't . Today was all that interested her in the first weeks they spent together . Today because it was the best time she had ever had , and she was n't sure that it would last , or that tomorrow would be half as desirable . Kyaren went to Mexico for the feel of people . Nowhere in Eastamerica , and certainly nowhere in the Songhouse , were there people like those who crowded the sidewalks of Mexico . No vehicles were allowedexcept the electric carts that brought in goods to the stores ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there were millions of them . And they all seemed to be outside all the time ; even in the rain , they sauntered through the streets with the rain sliding easily off their clothing , relishing the feel of it on their faces . This was a city where Kyaren 's hunger could be filled . She knew no one , but loved everyone . " They sweat , " Josif said . " You 're too immaculate , " Kyaren answered crossly . " They sweat and they step on your feet . I see no reason to be in a crowd any more than is unavoidable . " " I like the sound of them . " " And that 's the worst of it . Largest city in the world , and they insist on speaking Mexican , a language that has no reason to exist . " Kyaren only scowled at him . " Why not ? " " They 're only five thousand kilometers from Seattle , for heaven 's sake . We managed to talk like the rest of the empire . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , " she said . " I 've been learning it , and it opens your mind . " " And makes your tongue fall out of your mouth . " Josif had no patience with the eccentricities of his native planet . " Sometimes I 'm embarrassed as hell to be from Earth . " " The mother globe . " " These people are n't real Mexicans . Do you know what Mexicanswere ? Short and dark ! Show me a short dark person out there ! " " Does it matter if they can trace their pedigrees back to the numberone Mexican and her husband ? " Kyaren demanded . " They wantp174to be Mexican . And whenever I come here , I want to be Mexican . " It was a friendly argument that always ended either with them going outside  --  Kyaren to wander and talk to storekeepers and shoppers , Josif to prowl along the shelves , waiting for a title to make a sudden move so he could pounce  --  or in bed , where their pursuits more nearly coincided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take over the world . " Why not the universe ? " " Your ambition is disgusting , " Josif said , lying naked on the balconybecause he liked the feel of the rain , which was falling heavily . " Well , then , we 'll be modest . Where shall we start ? " " Here . " " Not practical . We have no base of operations . " " Tegucigalpa , then . We secretly twist all the programs of the computersto follow our every command . Then we cut off everybody 's salaries until they surrender . " They laughed ; it was a game . But a game they played seriously enough to do research . They would hunt for possible weaknesses , places that the system could be subverted . They also worked to get an overview of the system , to understand how it all fit together . Josif knew his way around the government library in Mexico , ' and they both spent time punching up readouts on the establishment of Tegucigalpaonly three hundred  --  odd years before . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been installedin the last ten years . Ten years ! And most other planets have been fully computerized for centuries . " " You 're too down on Earth , " Kyaren chided him , poring over minutesof meetings , which were so heavily edited at their level of clearancethat it was hard to get anything coherent out of them at all . But it was not in Mexico that they found the scam . It was at home . Kyaren had been reading a book on demographics , one that she had only been able to skim at Princeton . It set norms for age distributionson a planet ; she found the information fascinating , especially the variations that depended on local employment , climate , and relativewealth . She amused herself by plotting the demographic distribution of ages for Earth , based on the easily obtained statistics on employment and the economy . Then she took a few minutes of break time at work to check her figures . They were wrong.  |p175From  birth to retirement age at 8o , her figures were actually quite good . It was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough people were dying at those ages . In fact , she realized , almost no one was dying , compared to the normal mortality rates . And then , from loo to no , they died like flies , so that from no on the statistics were normal . Surely someone would have noticed this before , Kyaren thought . Certainly the Earth would have gained a reputation for unusually low mortality rates . It had to be common knowledge  --  the food distributionmust certainly be affected by it , and pension expenses must be unusually high . Scientists must be trying to discover the reason for the phenomenon . And yet she had never heard of it at all . In the programming manuals they had looked at in the library in Mexico , Kyaren had found some little-known programs that allowed an operator to check a program rather than use it to find and process data . Kyaren talked to Josif about it that night , which they spent in his place because it was larger and had room for both of them without having to petition for extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've checked my figures again and again , and they 're not wrong . " " Well , the only way to solve it is go kill some old people , I guess , " Josif said , reading a twenty-third-century mystery  --  in translation , ofcourse . " Josif , it 's wrong . Something 's wrong . " " Kyaren , " he said , impatient but trying not to sound like it , " this is a game we were playing . We really do n't have any responsibility for the whole world . Just for dead people and the not-quite-dead . And then just as numbers . " " I want to find out if the figures on death are right or not . " Josif closed the book . " Kyaren , the figures on death are right . That 's my job , is n't it ? I do death . " " Then check and see if my figures are right . " He checked . Her figures were right . " Your figures are right . Maybe the book 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographics for three centuries . Someone would have noticed by now . " Josif opened the book again . " Damned Earth . The people do n't even know when to die . " " You must have noticed it , " Kyaren said . " You must have seenp176that most of your deaths were grouped between a hundred and a hundred and ten . " " I 've never noticed anything like that . We deal with individuals , not the aggregate . We terminate files , you know ? We do n't watch trends . " " I just want to check some things . You know that program we found on checking entries ? The error-finder ? " " Yeah . " " Remember the numbers ? " " Kyaren , you 're not being very good company . " Together they figured out the numbers and codes ; Kyaren left for a few minutes and verified them on the local library terminal by hunting up her last library use . The program worked fine ; it was quite simple , in fact , which was why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a break , Kyaren punched in a date-of-entry query on the solitary death in Quong-yung district  --  she figured a singledeath would be simpler , would give her a single readout . What should have flashed on her screen was the date of entry , the name of the operator who entered the death information , the vital statistics entered on that date on that person , and the operation number . Instead , what flashed on was the bright RESTRICTED sign and what sounded was a loud buzzer at Warvel 's desk . Everyone looked up immediately , watched as Warvel got up quickly , looking alarmed . Kyaren knew that on his desk her area was flashing ; sure enough , when he located the culprit he slammed his hand on the desk and charged furiously over to her . " What the bloody hell are you doing , Kyaren ! " he bawled as he came over . What should she tell him  --  that she was playing a game of plottingto take over the world ? That she was double-checking the figures because they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " she said , letting herself sound as surprised and flustered as she felt . " I was just playing with the thing . Just punchingin random numbers and words , I do n't know . " " Which random numbers and words ? " he demanded , leaning over her terminal . " I do n't remember , " she lied . " It was just whimsical . " " It was just stupid , " he said back to her . " There are programs here that if you just randomly and whimsically happened to stumble on them , they 'd freeze the whole operation until the stinking police came to find out who 's trying to jury the system . You understand ?  |p177This  system is foolproof , but we do n't need any extra fools trying to prove it ! " She apologized profusely , but as he returned , unmollified , to his desk , she realized that he had seemed not so much angry as afraid . And the others in the room , as Warvel returned to his desk , looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What had she done ? " Kyaren , " Warvel said as she left the office at the end of the working day . " Kyaren , your four-month report is coming up in a few days . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to give you a negative report . " Kyaren was stunned . " Why ? " she asked . " You have n't been working . You 've been obviously loafing . It 's bad for morale , and it 's downright dishonest . " " When have I loafed ? " she asked . A negative report now , on her first job  --  especially one this easy  --  could destroy her hope of a governmentcareer . " I have complaints from fourteen people . Every single person in this office except you and me , Kyaren . They 're tired of watching you playing games . Studying up on ancient history and playing computer games when you should be trying to help old people cope with inflation and the fluctuations of the economy . We are n't here for fun , Kyaren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She nodded . " That 's what I 'm trying to do . " " I 'll give you a negative report , but I wo n't fire you unless there 's any more trouble . You understand ? Three years of perfect work and you get the negative report taken off your record . It 's something you can live down  --  if you just stick to business in the future . " She left . At home Josif was appalled . " Fourteen complaints ? " " That 's what he said . " " Kyaren , you could have an intimate sexual relationship with a lamp in the middle of the lunchroom and you 'd have a hard time getting three complaints ! " " What do they have against me ? " she asked . Josif 's face grew somber . " Me , " he said . " What ? " " Me . You had problems enough . Adding me to them  --  do you know how many women have tried to get me into bed ? There 's something about a known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They regard him as a challenge . Me as a challenge . And then you come along and suddenly we 're spending weekends to/gether . The ones that are n't jealous are probably revolted to think of what perverted things I must be making you do . " " It is n't you . " " Then what is it ? " " They 're afraid . " " Of what ? " " How should I know ? " Josif got up from the bed , went to the door , leaned on it . " Kyaren , it 's me . We 've got to stop . When you leave tonight that 's it . " He sounded sincere . She wondered why even the thought of leavinghim and not coming back made her feel as if she were falling from someplace very high . " I 'm not leaving tonight , " she said . " I 'm leaving in the morning . " " No . For your own good . " . She laughed incredulously . " My own good ! " He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My own good is to stay right here . " He shook his head . " Do you really mean this ? " she asked , unbelieving . " Just like that , you decide I 'm supposed to go because you think it 'll be better for me ? " " Sounds pretty stupid , does n't it , " he said . And they started laughing and he came back to the bed and suddenlythey were n't laughing , just holding each other and realizing that this was n't something they could simply end when it became inconvenient . " Josif , " she said . " Mmm ? " His face was buried in her hair , and he was sucking on a strand of it . " Josif , I frightened them . They 're afraid of something . " " You 're a pretty mean-looking woman . " " There 's something pretty funny about it . Why should deathentryinformation be restricted ? " They could n't think of a reason . And so the next day at lunch Josif had a sheet of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were ten names and ten numbers . " Can you use this ? " he asked . " What are they ? " " Dead people . Today 's first entries . They should be in your computerby now , since I punched them all in . That 's their identification numbers , and date of entry is a few hours ago . That 's basically allp179the date-of-entry code would have told you anyway . Can you do anything with them ? " Kyaren did n't dare bring the paper with her to the office  --  anything as unusual as paper would attract attention , and that was not what she needed . So she memorized the first three and left the list in the lavatory on the floor below . On her first break she came down , but instead of getting three more names she went to Josif . " Are you sure you copied these down correctly ? " Josif looked at the names and numbers , punched them into his terminal , and the vitals showed up . All definitely dead . " On my terminal , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Josif got up from his terminal and she followed him to the corridor , where Josif spoke softly . " We should have guessed it immediately . It 's a scam , Kyaren . They 're paying those pensions to somebody , but not to these people . Because they 're dead . " Kyaren leaned against the wall . " Do you know how much money that is ? " Josif was not impressed . " Come on , " he said . " Where ? " " Out of this building , immediately . " He started pulling her along . She came willingly enough , but completelyconfused . " Where are we going ? " He would n't answer . They did not go to either of their rooms . Insteadthey headed for the airport , which was on the eastern edge of the complex . " This is n't the time for a weekend in Mexico , " she said . " Just punch in sick . " They stood before the ticket terminal and she did as he said , using her office code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets for himself , charging them to his own account . " I can pay for my own , " she said . He did n't answer . He just took the tickets and they boarded the flit headed for Maraketch . It was when they were in flight that he finally began explaining . " It is n't just your office , Kyaren , " he said . " It 's mine , too . This thing has to involve a lot of people , in Death , in Disbursements , in Pensions , who knows where else . If they caught you on a simple query , they surely have a program to notice that you just queried the names of three people whose deaths were registered today , and that immediately afterward I queried the same names . The computerp180knows that somebody knows there is a discrepancy . And I do n't know how long we 'd live if we stayed there . " " They would n't do anything violent , would they ? " Kyaren asked . Josif only kissed her and said , " Wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where are we going ? " she asked again . " To report it , of course . Let the police handle it . Let Babylon do it . They have the power to freeze everything and everyone there while they investigate . We do n't have any power at all . " " What if we 're wrong ? " " Then we go looking for jobs about a billion lights away from here . " They told their story to five different officials before they finally found someone who was willing to take responsibility for a decision . The man was not introduced to them . But he was the first to listen to them without fidgeting , without looking uncomfortable or worried or distrustful . " Only three names ? " he finally asked , when Josif and Kyaren had explained everything . They nodded . " We did n't think it was safe to wait around looking for more . " " Absolutely right , " the man said . He nodded , as if in imitation of their nods a moment before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched as he picked up a phone , stroked in a code , and started giving orders in a jargon that they could n't understand . His face fascinated Kyaren , though she was not sure why . He looked unremarkable enough  --  not a large man , not particularly handsome , but not unusually ugly , either . His hair medium length , his eyes medium brown , his expression medium pleasant . Kyaren was aware of a constant change , not so much in his face as in her perceptionof his face ; like an optical illusion , his face kept switching back and forth between absolute trustworthiness and cold menace . No one had told them his title or even his name  --  he was just the one they passed a knotty problem to , and he did n't seem to mind . Finally he was through with his call and turned his attention back to Josif and Kyaren . " Very good work , " he said . Then he began to talk to them , very quietly , about themselves . He told Kyaren things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted suicide twice after Bant left him ; how Josif failed four classes at his university in his last term , yet turned in a dissertation that the faculty had no choice but to vote unanimouslyp181to accept ; how the faculty thereupon booted him out of the school with the worst possible recommendation letters so that it was impossible for him to get work in his field . " You do n't get along well with authority , do you , Josif ? " the man asked . Josif shook his head . The man promptly started in on Kyaren , talking about her upbringingin the Songhouse , her failure to meet even the most minimalstandards , her flight from that place where she was known to be inferior , her refusal to even mention the Songhouse to anyone else since then . " You are determined not to let anyone see you fail , are n't you , Kya-Kya ? " he asked . Kyaren nodded . She was acutely conscious of the fact that there was so much that Josif had n't told her about himself  --  important things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came more as a relief than as a letdown . Because now he also knew the things she had been deliberately hidingfrom him ; they had no secrets of any importance now . Was that what the man had been trying to do ? Or was he merely being nasty , pointing out to them that their friendship was n't all they had thought it was ? It hardly mattered . She looked at Josif furtively , saw that he also was avoiding her gaze . That would not do . So she stared at him until the very intensity of her gaze forced him to look back at her . And then she smiled . " Hi , stranger , " she said , and he smiled back . The man cleared his throat . " You two are a little better than the average . You 've been artificially , for various stupid reasons , kept in places where you could n't accomplish all that you are capable of . So I 'm giving you an opportunity . Try to use it intelligently . " They would have asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the Chief of Planetary Security who finally told them what was happening to them . " You 've been fired from your previous jobs , " he said , looking as serene as only a man with a great deal of power can look . " And given new ones . " Josif found himself assistant to the minister of education , with special authority over funds for research . Kyaren was made special assistantto the manager of Earth , where she could get her hands into anything on the planet . Not imperial offices , but about as high as novices could hope to get  --  work that would give them connections for future advances and all the opportunities they would need to show just what kind of work they were capable of doing . In a stroke , they had been given a chance to make careers for themselves . " Who is he , an angel ? God ? " Josif asked the Chief.  |p182The  Chief laughed . " Most people put him at the opposite end of things . The Devil . The Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . He 's just Ferret . The emperor 's ferret , you see . He makes people and he unmakes them , and answers only to the emperor . " They knew how well he could make people . The unmaking they saw when , a few weeks later , they were watching the vids in their apartment . The day in Babylon had been hot and rainy , until at sunsetthey had stood on their balcony watching the light glisten on waterdropsclinging to a billion blades of grass , with the long shadows of trees interrupting the lush savannah at random yet perfect intervals . An elephant moved lazily through the tall grass . A herd of gazellesbounded north in the distance . Kyaren and Josif felt utterly exhausted from the day 's work , utterly at peace from the evening 's beauty , a delicious mood of languor . They knew the conviction of the plotters would be cast from Tegucigalpa tonight , and they felt an obligation to watch . As moments from the trials were presented , with the faces of their former co-workers again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable . Not because she had turned them in  --  but because she had felt no qualms about doing so . Would she have been so eager to denounce them if they had not so openly excluded her ? She imagined what it might have been like if she had come into the Office of Pensions more humbly , not preceded by remarkable tests , not clothed in her perpetual reserve . Would they then have befriended her , gradually admitted her to the plot ? Would she then have denounced them ? Impossible to know , she realized . For if she had come humbly , she would not have been herself and so who could then predict how she would have acted ? Beside her , Josif gasped . Kyaren looked closely at the vids again . It was just another man in the dock , one she did n't know . " Who is it ? " she asked . " Gant , " Josif said , gnawing at his knuckles . In all their thinking , they had n't thought of this  --  that Bant , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . Kyaren had never met him , but felt that she knew him through Josif . Yet what she knew of him was his hilarity , his insistence that lovemaking had to be fun . Kyaren had n't enjoyed imagining Josif making love with a man , but that much , at least , had been impossible for Josif not to talk about . Apparently Bant 's greed for sex was just a facet of his overall greed ; his unconcern for Josif 's feelings was part of a general unconcern for anyone.  |p183All  those charged were convicted . They were all sentenced to five to thirty years in hard labor , deported , and permanently exiled from Earth , permanently barred from government employment . It was a severe sentence . Apparently it was not severe enough . The announcer began talking about the need to make an example of these people , lest others decide that a group scam on government funds might be worth the risks . As he talked , the vids showed a man from the back , walking toward the line of prisoners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bound . They looked toward the man who approached them , and their faces suddenly looked alarmed . The vids backed off so that the viewers could see why . The man held a blade . Not a laser  --  a blade , made of metal , a frightening thing in part because it was so ancient and barbaric . " Ferret , " Kyaren said , and Josif nodded . The vids did n't show the man 's face , but they were quite sure they recognized him . And then Ferret reached the first of the prisoners , paused before him , then moved to the next , paused . It was not until the fourth prisoner that the hand lashed out ; the blade caught the prisoner at the point where the jaw meets the ear , then flashed to the left and emerged at the same point on the other side . For a moment the prisonerlooked surprised , just surprised . Then a red line appeared along his throat , and suddenly blood erupted and spurted from the wound , spattering those to either side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes pleading for the act to somehow be undone . It was not undone . The guard behind the man held him up , and when the prisoner 's head sagged forward , the guard grabbed the hair and pulled the head back , so that the face could be seen . The action also made the wound gape , like the maw of a piranha . And finally the blood stopped pumping and the ferret , his back still to the vids , nodded . The guard let the man drop to the floor . Apparently the vids had shown this execution in detail because it was the first . As the ferret walked along , snicking the throats of every third , fourth , or fifth prisoner , the vids did not hold close for the dying , as they had with the first ; rather the program moved quickly . Kyaren and josif did not notice , however . Because from the moment the blade first flashed forward , catching the prisoner in the throat , Josif had been screaming . Kyaren tried to force him to look away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes from the man 's death , but even as he screamed piteously , Josif refused to take his eyes from the sight of the blood and the agony . And when the prisonersagged forward , Josif wept loudly , crying , " Gant ! Bant ! " Now they knew how the ferret unmade people . He must , Kyarenp184thought , he must have known how Josif felt about Bant , chose to kill him knowing that , as if to say , " You can denounce the criminal , but you can not do it without consequences . " Kyaren was sure that his choice of victim had been deliberate , for when he got to the last six people , he slowed down , looking each one of them in the eyes . The prisoners were reacting very differently , some trying to be stoic about their possible death , some trying to plead with him , some near vomiting with fear or disgust . With each person he passed , the next became more sure that he was the victim  --  the ferret had not skipped more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to the last one . The last one was Warvel , who was utterly certain that he would die  --  five had already been passed over . And Kyaren , her arms around Josif , who wept softly beside her , found herself inwardly pleased , sickeningly pleased , that Warvel would also die . If Bant , then surely Warvel . Then the ferret snaked out his hand . But not to kill . For the hand now was empty , and he caught Warvel by the neck , pulled him forwardaway from the guard . Warvel stumbled , nearly fell , his knees were so weak . But the vids carried the sound of Ferret 's voice . " Pardonthis one . The emperor pardons this one . " And Warvel 's bonds were loosed as the announcer 's voice began talking about how the emperor was to be remembered always  --  because when someone cheated or abused the people , the emperor would be the people 's champion and carry out their vengeance . " But always the emperor 's justice is tempered with mercy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still one of the emperor 's people . " Warvel . Bant . Whatever the ferret wanted to teach us , Kyaren whispered silently , so that even she could hardly hear the thought as her lips moved . Whatever the ferret wanted to teach us , we have learned . We have learned . And that was why Kyaren and Josif were in Babylon when Ansset was placed there.  |p185For  the first time in his life , Ansset lost songs . Up to now , everything that had happened to him had added to his music . Even Mikal 's death had taught him new songs , and deepened all the old ones . He spent only one month as a prisoner , but he spent it songless . Not that he meant to keep his silence . Occasionally , at first , he tried to sing . Even something simple , something he had learned as a child . The sounds came out of his throat well enough , but there was no fulfillment in it . The song always sounded empty to him , and he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps because of the constant reminderof the urn that had held Mikal 's ashes , perhaps because he felt entombed in the dusty room with its constant reminders of a long-gone past . Or perhaps because the drugs that delayed the Songbird'spuberty were now wearing off , and the changes came on more awkwardly because of the artificial delay . Ansset awoke often in the night , troubled by strange and unfulfilling dreams . Small for his age , he began to feel restless , an urge to grapple violently with someone or something , a passion for movement that , in the confines of Mikal'srooms , he could not fulfill . This is what the dead feel , Ansset thought . This is what they go through , shut up in their tombs or caught , embarrassingly , in public without their bodies . Ghosts may long to simply touch something , but bodiless they can not ; they may wish for heat , for cold , for even the deliciousness of pain , but it is all denied them . He counted days . With the poker from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearth , in spite of the fact that the ashes were of Mikal 's body  --  or perhaps because of it . And , at last , the day came when his contract was expired and he could finally go home . How could Riktors have misinterpreted him so ? In all his years with Mikal , Ansset had never had to lie to him ; and in his time with Riktors , there had also been a kind of honesty , though silences fell between them on certain matters . They had not been like father and son , as he and Mikal had been . They were more like brothers , though there was some confusion as to which of them was the elder brother , which the rambunctious younger one who had to be comforted , checked , counseled , and consoled . And now , simply by beingp186honest , Ansset had touched a place in Riktors that no one could have guessed was there  --  the man could be vindictive without calculation , cruel even to the helpless . Ansset had thought he knew Riktors  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted their sight , Ansset trusted his hearing . No one could lie to him or hide from him , not if they were speaking . But Riktors Ashen had hidden from him , at least in part , and Ansset was now as unsure as a sighted man who suddenly discovered that the wolves were all invisible , and walked beside him ravening in the night . On the day Ansset turned fifteen , he waited expectantly for the door to open , for the Mayor or , better yet , someone from the Songhouseto come in , to take his hand and bring him out . The Mayor did indeed come in . Near evening he came and wordlesslyhanded a paper to Ansset . It was in Riktors 's handwriting . I regret to inform you that the Songhouse has sent us word that you are not to return to them . Your service of two emperors , they said , has polluted you and you may not go back . The message was signed by Esste . It is unfortunate that this message should have come when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings to decidewhat we can possibly do with you , since neither we nor the Songhousecan find any further justification for maintaining you . This undoubtedlycomes as a blow to you . I 'm sure you can guess how sorry I am . Riktors Mikal , ImperatorIf Ansset 's long silence in Mikal 's rooms had ended with a return to the Songhouse , it might have helped him grow , as the silence and the suffering in the High Room with Esste helped him grow . But as he read the letter , the songs drained out of him . Not that he believed the letter at first . At first he thought it was a terrible , terrible joke , a last vindictive act by Riktors to make Ansset regret wanting to leave Earth and return to the Songhouse . But as the hours passed , he began to wonder . He had heard nothing from the Songhouse in his years on Earth . That was normal , he knew  --  but it was also distancing him from his memories there . The stone walls had faded into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Riktors was more real to him than Esste , though his feelings for Esste were more tender . But with that distance he began to think : perhaps Esste had merely been manipulatinghim . Perhaps their ordeal in the High Room had been a stratagem and nothing more  --  her complete victory over him , and not a shared experience at all . Perhaps he had been sent to Earth asp187a sacrifice ; perhaps the skeptics were right , and the Songhouse had given in to Mikal 's pressure and sent him a Songbird knowing he was unworthy , knowing that it would destroy the Songbird they sent and they could never bring him home . Maybe that was why , when Mikal died , the Songhouse did the unthinkableand let him stay with Riktors Ashen . It fit , and the more Ansset thought about it , the better it fit , until by the time he was able to sleep he had despaired . He still harbored a hope that tomorrow the Songhouse people would come in and tell him it was a cruel joke by Riktors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope was slimmer , and he realized that now , instead of being one of the few people on Earth who could regard himself as independentof the emperor , almost his equal , he was utterly dependent on Riktors , and not at all sure that Riktors would feel any obligation to be kind . That night his Control failed him , and he awoke from a dream weeping out loud . He tried to contain himself , but could not . He had no way of knowing that it was the onset of puberty that was weakening , temporarily , his knowledge of himself . He thought that it was proof that the Songhouse was right  --  he was polluted , weakened . Unworthy to return and live among the singers . If he had been restless before , now he was frantic . The rooms were smaller than they had ever been before , and the softness of the floor was unbearable . He wanted to strike it and find it hard ; instead it yielded to him . The dust , which his constant walking had pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to irritate him , and he sneezed frequently . He constantly caught himself on the edge of tears , told himself it was the dust , but knew it was the terror of abandonment . All his life that he could remember he had been surrounded by security , at first the security of the Songhouse , and later the security of an emperor 's love . Now , suddenly , both of them were gone , and a long-forgotten abandonment began to intrude into his dreams again . Someone was stealing him away . Someone was taking him from his family . Someone was vanishing his family in the distanceand he would never see them again and he woke up in darknessfull of terror , afraid to move in his bed , because if he so much as lifted an arm they would cease to forbear ; they would take him and he would never be found again , would live perpetually in a small cell in a rocking boat , would always be surrounded by the leering faces of men who saw only his nakedness and never his soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long silence ended . The Mayor came for him.  | " Riktors wants to see you , " the Mayor said , and because he was not delivering a memorized message his voice was his own , and it was sympathetic and warm , and Ansset trembled as he walked to him and took his offered hand and let himself be led from Mikal 's rooms to Riktors 's magnificent apartments . The emperor waited for him standing at a window , looking out over the forest where the leaves were starting to go red and yellow . There was a wind blowing outside , but of course it did not touch them . The Mayor brought Ansset inside and left him alone with Riktors , who showed no sign of knowing the boy had come . Boy ? Ansset was , for the first time , aware that he was growing , that he had grown . Riktors did not tower over him as he had when he took him away from the Songhouse . Ansset still did not come to his shoulder , but he knew that someday he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an equality of independence , for that feelingwas gone , but an equality of manhood . My hands are large , Anssetthought . My hands could tear his heart out . He pushed the thought into the back of his mind . He did not understand his lust for violent action ; he had had his fill of it , he thought , when he was a child . Riktors turned to face him , and Ansset saw that his eyes were red from weeping . " I 'm sorry , " Riktors said . And he wept again . The grief was sincere , unbearably sincere . By habit Ansset went to the man . But habit had weakened  --  where before he would have embracedRiktors and sung to him , he only came near , did not touch him , and certainly did not sing . He had no song for Riktors now . " If I could undo it , I would , " Riktors said . " But you pushed me harder than I can endure it . No one but you could have made me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth rang in Riktors 's voice , and with a sinking of his heart Anssetrealized that Riktors had not defrauded him . He was telling no lies . " Wo n't you sing to me ? " Riktors pleaded . Ansset wanted to say yes . But he could not . He hunted inside himself for a song , but he could n't find one . Instead of songs , tears pressed forward in his mind ; his face twisted , and he shook his head , making no sound . Riktors looked at him bitterly , then turned away . " I thought not . I knew you could never forgive me . " Ansset shook his head and tried to make a sound , tried to say , Ip189forgive you . But he found no sound inside himself right now . Found nothing but fear and the agony of being forsaken . Riktors waited for Ansset to speak , to deny , to forgive ; when it becameclear the silence would last forever if it were up to Ansset to break it , Riktors walked . Around the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his bed , which , when it was clear he was not going to lie down , cooperated by flowing up and around his back a little , providing support . " Well , then , I wo n't punish you further by keeping you with me here in the palace . You are n't going back to Tew . I ca n't just pensionyou off ; I owe you better treatment than that . So I 've decided to give you work . " Ansset was incurious . " Do n't you care ? Well , I do , " Riktors said to Ansset 's silence . " The manager of Earth is due for a promotion . I 'll give you his job . You 'll report directly to the imperial capital , no prefects between us . The Mayor wanted to give you something smaller , some office where you would n't have so much responsibility . " Riktors laughed . " But you are n't trained for any lesser office , are you ? At least you know protocol . And the staff is very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you need help , I 'll see to it you get it . " Riktors studied Ansset 's face for any sign of emotion , though he knew better . Ansset wanted to show him something , show him what he was looking for . But it took all Ansset 's concentration to maintain Control , to keep from breaking the glass and leaping from the palace to get outside , to keep from weeping until he cried his throat out . So Ansset said and showed nothing . " But I do n't want to see you , " Riktors said . Ansset knew it was a lie . " No , that 's a lie . I must see you , I ca n't live without seeing you . I found that out clearly enough , Ansset . You showed me how much I need you . But I do n't want to need you , not you , not now . And so I ca n't want to see you , and so I wo n't see you . Not until you 're ready to forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me again . " I ca n't sing to anyone , Ansset wanted to say . " So I 'll have them give you some sort of training  --  there is n't any school for planet managers , you know . The best they can do , meetingswith the current manager . And then they 'll take you to Babylon . It 's a beautiful place , they tell me . I 've never seen it . Once you get to Babylon , we 'll never meet again . " His voice was painful , and it tore at Ansset 's heart . For a moment he wanted to embrace this man who had , after all , been his brother and his friend . He had known Riktors ,  |p190he  thought , and Ansset did not know how not to love someone he so completely understood . But I did not really understand him , Ansset realized . Riktors was hidden from me , and I do not know him . It was a wall , and Ansset did not breach it . Instead , Riktors tried to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansset stood , knelt in front of him , embraced him around the waist , and wept into his hip , clinging desperately . " Ansset , please . Take it back ! Say you love me , say that this is your home , sing to me , Ansset ! " But Ansset held his silence , and the man slid down his body until he lay crumpled at Ansset 's feet , and finally the weeping stopped and , without lifting his head , Riktors said , " Go . Get out of here . You 'll never see me again . Rule the Earth , but you wo n't rule me any longer . You can leave . " Ansset pulled away from Riktors 's slack arm and walked to the door . He touched it ; it opened for him . But he had not left when Riktors cried out in agony , " Wo n't you say anything to me ? " Ansset turned around , hunting for something to break the silence with . Finally he thought of it . " Thank you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , for still wanting me , for giving me something to do now that I ca n't sing anymore , now that my home is closed to me . But Riktors heard it another way . He heard Ansset saying thank you for letting me leave you , thank you for not requiring me to be near you , thank you for letting me live and work in Babylon where I wo n't be required to sing for you anymore . And so , to Ansset 's surprise , when his voice croaked out the two words , utterly devoid of music , Riktors did not take them kindly . He only looked at Ansset with a look that the boy could only interpret as cold hatred . The look held for a few minutes , an unbearably long time , before Ansset finally could not stand to see Riktors 's hatred any longer . He turned away and passed through the door . It closed behind him . When the door closed , Ansset realized that at last he was no longer a Songbird . The work he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt relieved . The music fell off him like a burdenwelcomely shed . It would be some time before he realized that not singing was an even heavier burden , and one far harder to be rid of.  |p191Songmaster  Onn returned alone to the Songhouse . No one was eager to spread bad news ; no one rushed ahead of him to report that , incredibly , his mission had failed . And so Esste , waiting patiently in the High Room , was the first to hear that Ansset would not come home . " I was not allowed to come to Earth . The other passengers were unloaded by shuttle , and I never set foot on the planet . " " The message , " Esste said . " Was it sent in Ansset 's own lan-guage ? " " It was a personal apology from Riktors Mikal , " Onn said , and he recited it : " ' I regret having to inform you that Ansset , formerly a Songbird , refuses to return to Tew . His contract has expired , and since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally compel him . I hope you will understand that for his protection no one from the Songhouse will be allowed to land on Earth while he is here . He is busy ; he is happy ; do not be concerned for him . " Esste and Onn looked at each other in silence , but the silence between them sang . " He is a liar , " Esste finally said . " This much is true : Ansset does not sing . " " What does he do ? " Onn looked and sounded pained as he said it . " He is manager of Earth . " Esste sucked in air quickly . She sat in silence , her eyes focused on nothing . Onn 's voice had been as kind as possible , his song gentle to her . But there was no gentleness in the message . Riktors might have forced Ansset to stay  --  that was believable . But how could Ansset have been forced to take a position of such responsibility ? " He is so young , " Esste sang . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was cruel to him . " " You gave him nothing but kindness . " " When Riktors begged me to let them stay together , I should have refused . " " All the Songmasters agreed that he should stay . " And then a cry that was not a song , that came deeper from within Esste than all her music.  | " Ansset , my son ! What have I done to you , Ansset , my son , my son ! " Onn did not stay to watch Esste lose Control . What she did alone in the High Room was her own affair . He descended the long flight of steps , his body heavy with his own regret . He had had time to get used to the idea of Ansset not returning . Esste had not . Esste could not , he feared . Not a week had passed since Ansset had left that Esste had not sung of him , either mentioning him by name or singing a melody that those who knew her recognized  --  a song of Ansset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been produced by the child 's throat , or by Esste 's , since she knew all his songs so well . His homecoming had been watched for as no other singer 's return . There was no celebration planned , except in the hearts of those who meant to greet him . But there the songs had been waiting , ready to burst the air with rejoicing for the greatest Songbird of them all . The place was ready for Ansset . It was meant that he would begin to teach at once . It was meant that his voice would sing all the hours of the day , would lead the song in the courtyards , would be heard in the evening from the tower . It was meant that , someday , he would be Songmaster , perhaps in the High Room . Onn had had time to get used to the failure of all these intentions . Yet as he walked slowly down the stairs he heard his footsteps ringinghollowly against the stone , for he still wore his traveling shoes . The wrong wanderer has returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last song , years before , in the great hall . The memory of it was thin . It sounded like wind in the tower , and made him feel cold . Ansset had only been in Babylon a week when he got lost . He had been in the palace too long . It did n't occur to him that he did n't know his way around . And in fact he had learned almost immediatelyevery corner of the manager 's building , which he was sharingfor two weeks with the outgoing manager , who was trying to acquainthim with his staff and the current problems and work . It was tedious , but Ansset thrived on tedium these days . It kept his mind off himself . It was much more comfortable to immerse himself in the work of government . He had no training for it , formally . But informally , he had the best training in the world . Hours and hours spent listening to Mikalp193and Riktors pour their hearts out , discreetly , about the decisions that faced them . He had been the dumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strange to him to face the problems of a world . Yet there were times when they left him alone . There were limits to what anyone could absorb , and though Ansset knew he had no reason to be ashamed of the way he had been learning , he was keenly aware of the fact that they all thought him to be a child . He was small , and his voice had not changed , thanks to the Songhouse drugs . And so they were solicitous , oversolicitous , he thought . " I can do more , " he said one day when they quit before sunset . " That 's enough for a day , " the minister of education said . " They told me not to go past four and it 's nearly five . You 've done very well . " Then the minister had realized that he was sounding patronizing , tried to correct himself , then gave it up and left . Alone , Ansset went to the window and looked out . Other rooms had balconies , but this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings to the west . Yet below , where the stilts of the building left undisturbed ground , thick grass grew , and Ansset saw a bird rise from the grass ; saw a large mammal lumbering under the buildings , heading , he assumed , toward the river to the east . And he wanted to go outside . No one went outside , of course , not in this weather . Months from now , when the Ufrates rose and the plain was water from horizon to horizon , then there would be boating parties dodging hippopotamusesand singing from building to building , while work went on in the buildings rooted in bedrock , like herons ignoring the currentbecause their feet had a firm grasp in the mud . Now , however , the plain belonged to the animals . But there was no door that did not open to Ansset 's hand , no buttonthat did not work when he pushed it . And so he took elevators to the lowest floor , and there wandered until he found the freight elevator . He entered , pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door opened and Ansset stepped out into the grass . It was a hot evening , but a breeze flowed under the buildings . The air smelled very different from the deciduous breezes of Susquehanna , but it was not an unpleasant smell , though it was pungent with animals . The elevator had brought him to the center of the space under the building . The sun was just beginning to become visible between the second building to the west and the ground ; Ansset 's shadow seemed to stretch a kilometer into the east . Better than sight or smell , however , was the sound . Distantly hep194heard the roaring of some indelicate beast ; much closer , the cry of birds , a more savage cry than the twitters of the small birds in Eastamerica . He was so enthralled with the novelty of the sound , and the beauty of it , that he hardly noticed that the elevator behind him was rising until he turned to follow the motion of a bird and realized that there was nothing behind him at all . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen into the building , and was just settlinginto its place , a metal square high above him on the bottom of the first floor . Ansset had no idea how to get the elevator to come down again . For a moment he was afraid . Then he thought wryly that they would notice he was missing almost immediately , and come looking for him . Someone always came and asked him if he needed anything every ten minutes or so . As long as he was away from everyone , as long as he was there with his feet in the grass and his ears attuned to new music , he might as well make the most of it . The buildings extended indefinitelyto the east ; to the west , only two buildings stood between him and the open plain . So he went west . He had never seen so much space in his life . True , the plain was dotted with trees , so that if he looked far enough , the trees made a thin green line that kept the world from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky seemed to be enormous , and birds disappeared easily into it , they were so small against the dazzling blue . Ansset tried to imagine the plain in flood , with the trees rising resolutely above the water , so that boaters could dock in the branches and picnic in the shade . The land was unrelentingly flat  --  there was no high ground . Ansset wondered what became of the animals . Probably they migrated , he decided , though for a moment he imagined thousands of game wardens gathering them up and flying them to safe ground . A vast evacuation ; man protecting nature in a reversal of the ancient roles . But it happened only here , in the huge Origins Imperial Park , which stretched from the Mediterranean and Aegean seas to the valley of the Indus River . Here dead land had been brought to life , and only Babylon , and here and there a tourist center , interrupted the animals ' reclaimed kingdom . As the sun touched the horizon , the birds became almost frantic in their calls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals would prowl , some in their last activity before night , others in their first activity after a day of sleep . The song made Ansset feel at peace . He had thought never to feelp195that way again , and he felt tension he had n't known gripped him gradually uncoil and relax . Almost by reflex he opened his mouth to sing . Almost . Because the very length of time between songs called to his attention the novelty of the act . He was instantly aware that this was his First Song . And so as he began to sing , the music was tortured by calculation . What should have been reflex became deliberate , and therefore he faltered , and could not sing . He tried , and of course tones came out . He did not know that much of the awkwardnesswas simply lack of use , and that much of it was the fact that his voice was now beginning to change . He only knew that something that had been as natural as breathing , as walking , was now totally unnatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , his voice as forlorn as a cormorant cry . The birds near him fell silent , instantly sensing that he did not belong among them . I do n't belong among you , he said silently . Or among anyone else . My own wo n't have me , and here I 'm a stranger . Only Control kept him from weeping , and gradually , as feeling built inside him , he realized that , songless , he could not keep Control . There had to be an outlet somewhere . And so he cried out , again and again , screams and howls into the sky . It was an animal sound , and it frightened even him as he made the noise . He could have been a wounded beast , from the sound ; fortunately , the predators were not easily fooled , and did not come to the cries . Someone came , however , and not long after he fell silent and the sun disappeared behind the distant trees , someone touched his elbow from behind . He whirled , frightened , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a moment he placed her in his mind . She belonged , oddly , both in the Songhouse and in the palace . Only one person had ever stood both places in his life , besides himself . " Kya-Kya , " he said , and his voice was hoarse . " I heard your cry , " she said . " Are you hurt ? " " No , " he said , instantly . They looked at each other , neither sure what to say . Finally KyaKyabroke the silence . " Everyone was in a panic . No one knew where you had gone . But I knew . Or thought I knew . Because I come down here , too . Not many of us ever make the descent when it 's the dry season . The animals are n't very good company . They just wander around looking powerful and free . Human beings are n't meant to look at power and freedom . Makes them jealous . " She laughed , and so did he . Gracelessly , however . Something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I 'm one of your special assistants . You have n't met me yet . I 'm on your agenda for next week . I 'm not very important . " He said nothing , and again Kya-Kya waited , unsure what to say . They had spoken before  --  angrily , on her part , when they conversed both in the Songhouse and in the palace . But she was damned if she 'd let that stand in the way of her career . A terrible thing , having this boy made her direct superior , but she could and would make the best of it . " I 'll show you how to go back . If you want to go back . " He still said nothing . There was something strange about his face , though she could n't think what it was . It seemed rigid somehow . Yet that could n't be it  --  he had been utterly unflinching when she talked to him in his cell in the Songhouse and he sang comfort to her , an inhuman face , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . He still did n't answer . Helpless , unsure what to do for this child who had her future in his control  --  the Songhouse comes back to haunt me no matter what I do , she thought , as she had thought a hundred times since learning he would be manager  --  she waited . Finally she realized that what was wrong with his face was that it was not rigid . It was only trying to be . The boy was trembling . The most perfectly controlled creature in the Songhouse was shaking , and his voice wavered and sounded awkward as he said , " I do n't know where I am . " " You 're just two buildings away from your  --  " And then she realized that he did not mean that . " Help me , " he said . Her feelings toward the boy suddenly wrenched , turned completelyanother way . She had been prepared to deal with him as a tyrant , as a monster , as a haughty superior . She had not been prepared to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I help you ? " she whispered . " I do n't know my way , " he said . " You will , in time . " He looked impatient , more frightened ; the mask was coming off his face . " I 've lost my . . . I 've lost my voice . " She did not understand . Was n't he speaking to her ? " Kya-Kya , " he said . " I ca n't sing anymore . " Of all the people on Earth , only Kya-Kya could possibly understand what he meant , and what it meant to him.  | " Not ever ? " she asked , incredulous . He shook his head , and tears came to his eyes . The boy was helpless . Still beautiful , the face still impossible not to look at , and yet now a real child , which in her mind he had never been before . Lost his voice ! Lost the one thing that had made him a success where Kyaren had been a hopeless failure ! She was instantly ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost it . And she forced herself to compare his loss to her losing her intellect , on which she depended for everything . It was not imaginable . Mikal 's Songbird , without singing ? " Why ? " she asked . In answer a tear came uncontrolled from his eye . Ashamed , he wiped it off , and in the gesture won her to his side . Whatever side that was . Someone had done something to Ansset , something worse than his kidnapping , something worse than Mikal 's death . She reached out to him , put her arms around him , and then said words that she had not thought ever to recall to her mind , let alone to her lips . She spoke the love song to him , in a whisper , and he wept in her arms . " I 'll help you , " she said afterward . " All I can , I 'll help you . And you 'll get your voice back , you 'll see . " He only shook his head . Her chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she led him to a stilt and stroked the panel that called the elevator , and as it descended she held him at arm 's length from her . " My first help to you is this . To me you can cry . To me you can show anything and say anything you feel . But to no one else , Ansset . You thought you needed Control before , but you really need it now . " He nodded , and almost immediately his face became composed again . The boy has n't forgotten all his tricks , she thought . " It 's easier , " he said , " when I can let it out somehow . " Now that I ca n't sing it out , he did n't say . But she heard the words all the same , and while he stood alone and walked beside her through the buildings , where anyone could see them , in the enclosed bridges that connectedthe buildings , leading them back to the manager 's quarters , he reached to Kya-Kya , and took her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyone that had hurt her . It amazed her how easily that hate could dissipate , justp198because he let himself be vulnerable . Now that she could hurt him , she never would . The chief of staff was beside himself with joy at Ansset 's return ; but he spoke to Kya-Kya , not Ansset , as he asked , " Where did you find him ? Where was he ? " Coldly Ansset said to the man , " She found me where I chose to be , Calip , and I returned when I chose to come . " Deliberately he turned to Kya-Kya and said , " Please meet me at eight o'clock in the morning , Kya-Kya . I would like you to be with me through tomorrow'smeetings . Calip , I want supper at once . " Calip was surprised . He had been so much in the habit of giving Ansset his schedule and introducing people to him , it did n't occur to him until now that Ansset would have things his own way . After a moment of embarrassed inaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the man was gone , Ansset looked at Kyaren with raised eyebrows . " That was pretty good , " Kyaren said . " Mikal was better at it , but I 'll learn , " Ansset said . Then he smiled at her , and she smiled back . But in his smile she still saw the traces of his fear , a hint of the expression on his face when he had pleaded for help . And in her voice , as Kyaren said good-bye , he heard friendship . And he was , to his own surprise , certain that she meant it from the heart . Perhaps , he thought to himself , I may survive this after all . " It 's very important , " said the minister with the Latin portfolio . " There has been bloodshed . Thirty people killed , that we know of , and ten of those in open combat . " Ansset nodded . " There 's another complication , sir . While the Uruguayans and Paraguayans are willing to speak Imperial in this meeting , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the chief of staff said , " because the Portuguese do n't even speak it anymore . " Ansset had never understood the purpose of multiple languages . He thought of it as an aberration of history , which had luckily been set to rights years before . And here , on the capital of the empire , wasp199a rather large nation that clung to an anachronism to the point of antagonizing those who had power over them . " Do we have an interpreter ? " The chief of staff nodded . " But he 's one of them . No one here speaks Portuguese . " Ansset looked over at Kyaren , who smiled . She sat beside him , but deferentially pulled back from the table , appearing to be a secretary but actually ready to slip him a note . She had been studying this problem for weeks for the outgoing manager  --  she already had in mind several compromise solutions to the border war , depending on how cooperative they were . Since the Brazilians were currently in control of the land , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were famous for being uncooperative . " Bring them in , " Ansset said . Two envoys entered from each nation . Protocol in this case demandedthat they enter in order of age of the envoys , so that no nationwould seem to get precedence . Ansset noticed , however , that each team included one who was very , very old . Odd , the things nationswere willing to invest their pride in . The chief of staff explained carefully the rules of the discussion . No interruptions would be tolerated . Any envoy who interrupted any other envoy would be summarily dismissed and no replacement would be allowed . They would ask Ansset for permission to speak , and would listen politely to all other speakers . Ansset was surprised that such instructions were necessary . In the imperial court it was all taken for granted . Then everyone waited while the Brazilian interpreter translated the instructions into Portuguese . Ansset watched carefully . It was as he had suspected . The Brazilian envoys did not pay much attention to the translation  --  they had understood the Imperial perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated Ansset . He had never before thought of shaping his mouth in just that way , using his nose to such good effect . It enticed him . As the interpreter spoke , Ansset formed the sounds in his mouth , felt them in his head . More than the individual sounds , he also sensed cadence , feeling , mood . The language was expressive , and without understanding the intensionsof the language , he knew he could use it well enough to accomplishhis purpose . As soon as the interpreter was finished , the envoys all lifted their hands slightly off the table , palms facing Ansset  --  asking for permission to speak . Ansset impulsively turned to the Brazilian ambassador and began to sing . Not the music he had performed so often before.  |p200This  was speech considered as song , and Portuguese language used for the sheer sound and power of it . If there were any recognizable words in it , it was an accident . But Ansset spoke on and on , delighted that he had not lost the power of imitation , working carefully to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch them . The Brazilians , one ancient man who did not seem altogether alert and a younger man with a look of resolute determination , were startledto hear their own language , then puzzled to try to decipher it . Even to them , it sounded like perfect Portuguese . But it was doubletalk , and the younger one looked angry for a moment , thinking he was being mocked . By then , however , Ansset 's tone had got through to them ; they felt that despite the nonsense of his words , he was speaking affection and understanding to them . This is a beautiful language , he seemed to be saying , and I understand your pride in it . What would have been mockery by anyone else was high praise when spoken by Ansset , and when he at last fell silent , looking intently at them , the Brazilians both arose from the table , walked around it , and approached Ansset . The guards in the room , at least as puzzled by what had happened as anyone else , fingered their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , motioned them to relax . The old Brazilian first , and then the young one , embraced Ansset . It was an incongruoussight , the old man clinging to the beautiful boy , and then the tall younger man bending to touch his rough cheek to Ansset 's smooth one . While they were in the embrace , Ansset murmured , in Imperial , " I beg you to speak Imperial so that the others can understand us . " And the man smiled , stepped back from Ansset , and said , " The manager Ansset is too kind . No other governor has troubled to understandus or our love of our country . He has asked me to speak Imperial , and for his gracious sake I will . " Kya-Kya , no less surprised than anyone else , could not help but noticethe look of consternation on the interpreter 's face . She was sure the Brazilians had planned a strategy of using the interpreter as a means of pacing the meeting , controlling it to their own purposes , since whenever anyone spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded , and the pretense that Brazilian envoys spoke no Imperial would have to be abandoned for good . The meeting proceeded , and gradually the envoys laid out their cases . In the troubled Parana region , the original inhabitants had spoken Spanish , and now , millennia later , they still did . However , inp201the last four hundred years , Brazilians had asserted hegemony over the region  --  successfully , since before Mikal made Earth his capital there was little planetary government , and there were few restraints on national governments . Now the veneer of Portuguese was wearing thin , as the Spanish-speaking majority began to resent the greater and greater pressure on them to give up their language . Complicatingmatters further , the people in the north spoke the Paraguayan version of Spanish , which was unintelligible to the Uruguayans . There had been a lot of talk about self-determination for years , matched by official Brazilian statements about One Nation , Indivisible . The talk had finally turned into bloodshed , and the Uruguayans and Paraguayans were demanding that the Brazilians hand over the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Brazilians did not want to turn over fifty percent of their nonsolar energy to other nations . And when the envoys had finished presenting their case , Ansset asked them to prepare in writing a one-page summary of what they think a just solution would be that would meet the needs of all the parties to the dispute . Then he dismissed them until after he had a chance to read their proposals . In private , the minister with the Latin portfolio was effusive . " How did you do it ? What did you say to them ? " Ansset only smiled and said nothing , turning his attention to KyaKya , who had scribbled furiously throughout the meeting . " The disagreementreally is n't insoluble . They do n't want opposite things , " she said . " The Brazilians want to save face , to maintain their borders . They 're very tight on this . And they need the energy . But the others are simply asking for preservation of culture . They want the Spanish-speaking citizens to be allowed to dominate in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really use the hydroelectric energyin the area . " The Latin minister nodded , agreeing with her . They began drawing up the proposed compromise even before the envoys ' proposals began arriving . It was evening before the envoys were called back . Kyaren was delighted with the way Ansset looked  --  as fresh and cheerful as he had in the morning . As if no work had gone on at all , as though the solution to their problems seemed easy . Ansset read his compromise to them , providing them with copies when he was through . " Let us study this , " said the younger envoy from Paraguay . " I doubt that there 's a need , " said Ansset , following Kyaren 's advice . " This is very little different from your own proposal . Indeed , we were quite pleased with the fairness with which you approached thep202problem . " Ansset began parrying the various objections skillfully . Kyaren and the Latin minister had already gone over with him very carefully which items could be altered and how far . Ansset 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking love and appreciation to the envoys . Thank you for being willing to give a little on this point , in the interest of peace . And on this point , you can see why I can not give in , because it would be intolerable to the others , and justly so . But we can give here , would that help ? Ah , I thought it would . Each envoy was completely convinced that Ansset was their advocatein the discussion , and when it was finished , late at night , the clerks prepared a fair copy of the new agreement and all the envoys and Ansset signed it . And then , with peace looking quite possible , Ansset carefully looked around the table . He still did not seem tired ; Control , Kyaren thought . " My friends , " Ansset said , " I have come to respect you very much today . You have acted quickly and fairly and wisely . Now , I know that some of your governments will look at these compromises and want to change them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own governments . And I certainly do n't want to see you or other envoys back again with the same dispute . So you may tell your governments as apologetically as you like that if they do not accept this compromise exactly as it is written here , within five days , I will rewrite the agreement to exclude that government entirely from the solution , and if after that there is any further resistance , I will remove the government from power . I mean to have this reasonable document treated as law . Do you understand ? " They understood . " But there is no reason to tell them how intransigent I intend to be unless they bring up objections . I trust to your discretion and good judgment , which I have learned to respect today better than I respect my own . And now let 's go to bed ; I 'm sure you 're all as tired as I am . " When Ansset arose to leave , the envoys spontaneously applauded him . The evening was not over yet , however . Ansset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a small chamber where the outgoing manager waited for them . He had been watching everything by vids all day . And now he was supposed to criticize Ansset'sactions and statements , helping him to learn from his mistakes . " But you made no mistakes , " the manager said , with a smile thatp203did not , to Kyaren 's eyes , look sincere . " And so I can leave with an easy heart . " And he left . " He can talk about an easy heart all he likes , " Ansset said to Kyaren when the man was gone . " But he did n't like me . " She laughed . " Can you tell Ansset why ? " she asked the Latin minister . The minister did not laugh . " I do n't wish to sound disrespectful of the former manager , Ansset , but no one has ever been able to deal reasonably with the Brazilians . This is the first time I 've ever seen a conference end without the manager having to threaten to send in troops against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I liked them . " Then the minister left , and Ansset sat down . The weariness finally showed in his face , and he was trembling . " This is the hardest thing I 've ever done in my life , " he said softly . " It should get easier , " Kyaren answered , still surprised to see him showing weakness . " Look , " Ansset said . " I 'm shaking . I never shake . " Because you used to sing , Kyaren did not say . They were both well aware of the reason why Ansset could not maintain perfect Control anymore . She helped him up from the bench where he sat . " Are you going to bed now ? " Kyaren asked . Ansset shook his head . " I doubt it . I could n't sleep . Or if I forced myself to , I 'd pay for it tomorrow . Break a window and chew the glass , or something . " Ansset was obviously ashamed of his new weakness . " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have n't had supper , and we could eat together and relax a little . If you do n't mind . " Ansset did not mind . Josif woke up more from the smell than the sound . At least the smell was the first thing he was aware of , real food cooking in the kitchen instead of the bland smell of machine food . He looked at the clock . One in the morning . He had gone to bed three hours before , knowingKyaren would not be home until late . But real food was cooking in the kitchen , and while they had real food often  --  one of the **28;7576;TOOLONG today , and this frightens me more , to stand here quietly talking with you about these things . " " Call me Valentine . " " How can I ? " Sleet asked . " You called me Valentine five minutes ago . " " That was before . " " Nothing has changed , Sleet . " Sleet shook the idea away . " Everything has changed , my lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a fraud , manipulating Sleet in this way , and yet there seemed purpose to it , and genuine need . " If everything has changed , then will you follow me as I command ? Even to Ilirivoyne ? " " If I must , " said Sleet , dazed . " No harm of the kind you fear will come to you among the Metamorphs . You 'll emerge from their country healed of the pain that has racked you . You do believe that , do n't you , Sleet ? " " It frightens me to go there . " " I need you by me in what lies ahead , " said Valentine . " And through no choice of mine , Ilirivoyne has become part of my journey . I ask you to follow me there . " Sleet bowed his head . " If I must , my lord . " " And I ask you , by the same compulsion , to call me Valentine and show me no more respect in front of the others than you would have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleet said . " Valentine . " " Valentine , " said Sleet reluctantly . " As you wish  --  Valentine . " " Come , then . " He led Sleet back to the group . Zalzan Kavol was , as usual , pacing impatiently ; the others were preparing the wagon for departure . To the Skandar Valentine said , " I 've talked Sleet into withdrawing his resignation . He 'll accompany us to Ilirivoyne . " Zalzan Kavol looked altogether dumfounded . " How did you manage to do that ? " " Yes , " said Vinorkis . " What did you say to him , anyway ? " With a cheerful smile Valentine said , " It would be tedious to explain , I think . "  |p151The  pace of the journey now accelerated . All day long the wagon purred along the highway , and sometimes well into the evening . LisamonHultin rode alongside , though her mount , sturdy as it was , needed more rest than those that drew the wagon , and occasionally she fell behind , catching up as opportunity allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any animal . On they went through a tamed province of city after city , broken only by modest belts of greenery that barely obeyed the letter of the density laws . This province of Mazadone was a place where commercial pursuits kept many millions employed , for Mazadone was the gateway to all the territories of northwestern Zimroel for goods coming from the east , and the chief transshipment point for overland conveyance of merchandise of Pidruid and Til-omon heading eastward . They passed quickly in and out of a host of interchangeable and forgettable cities , Cynthion and Apoortel and Doirectine , Mazadone city itself , Borgax and Thagobar beyond it , all of them subdued and quiescent during the mourning period for the late duke , and strips of yellow dangling everywhere as sign of sorrow . It seemed to Valentine a heavy thing to shut down an entire province for the death of a duke . What would these people do , he wondered , over the death of a Pontifex ? How had they responded to the premature passing of the Coronal Lord Voriax two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local duke more seriously , he thought , for he was a visible figure , real and present among them , whereas to people of Zimroel , thousands of miles sepaIIrated from Castle Mount or Labyrinth , the Powers of Majipoor must seem largely abstract figures , mythical , legendary , immaterial . On a planet so large as this no central authority could govern with real efficiency , only symbolic control ; Valentine suspected that much of the stability of Majipoor depended on a social contract whereby the local governors  --  the provincial dukes and the municipal mayors  --  agreed to enforce and support the edicts of the imperial government , provided that they might do as they pleased within their own territories . How , he asked himself , can such a contract be upheld when the Coronal is not the anointed and dedicated prince , but some usurper , lacking in the grace of the Divine through which such fragile socialconstructs are sustained ? He found himself thinking more and more upon such matters during the long , quiet , monotonous hours of the eastward journey.  |p152Such  thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to the lightness and simplicity of his mind since the early days of Pidruid , and he could feel a progressive enrichment and growingcomplexity of mental powers now . It was as if whatever spell had been laid upon him was wearing thin , and his true intellect was beginning to emerge . If , that is , any such magic had actually befallen him as his graduallyforming hypothesis required . He was still uncertain . But his doubts were weakening from day to day . In dreams now he often saw himself in positions of authority . One night it was he , not Zalzan Kavol , who led the band of jugglers ; on another he presided in princely robes over some high council of the Metamorphs , whom he saw as eerie foglike wraiths that would not hold the same shape more than a minute at a time ; a night later he had a vision of himself in the marketplace at Thagobar , dispensing justice to the cloth-sellers and vendors of bangles in their noisy little disputes . " You see ? " Carabella said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Power ? Majesty ? Sitting on a barrel in a market and expounding on equity to dealers in cotton and linen ? " " In dreams many things are translated . These visions are metaphorsof high might . " Valentine smiled . But he had to admit the plausibility of the interpretation . One night as they were nearing the city of Khyntor there came to him a most explicit vision of his supposed former life . He was in a room paneled with the finest and rarest of woods , glistening strips of semotan and bannikop and rich dark swamp mahogany , and he sat before a sharp-angled desk of burnished palisander , signing documents . The starburst crest was at his right hand ; obsequious secretaries hovered about ; and the enormous curving window before him revealed an open gulf of air , as though it looked out upon the titanic slope of Castle Mount . Was this a fantasy ? Or was it some fugitive fragment . of the buried past that had broken free and come floating up in his sleep to approach the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk to Carabella and to Deliamber , hoping they could tell him how the office of the Coronal looked in reality , but they had no more idea of that than they did of what the Pontifex had for breakfast . The Vroon asked him how he had perceived himself '  |p153when  sitting at that palisander desk : was he golden-haired , like the Valentine who rode in the jugglers ' wagon , or dark , like the Coronal who had made grand processional through Pidruid and the western provinces ? " Dark , " said Valentine immediately . Then he frowned . " Or is that so ? I was sitting at the desk , not looking at the man who was there because I was the man . And yet  --  and yet  --  " Carabella said , " In the world of dreams we often see ourselves with our own eyes . " " I could have been both fair and dark . Now one , now the other  --  the point escaped me . Now one , now the other , eh ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , after too many days of steady , wearying overland travel . This , the major city of north-central Zimroel. lay in rugged , irregular terrain , broken by lakes and highlands and dark , virtually impassable forests . The route chosen by Deliamber took the wagon through the city 's southwestern suburbs , known as Hot Khyntor because of the geothermal marvels there  --  great hissing geysers , and a broad steaming pink lake that bubbled and gurgled ominously , and a mile or two of gray rubbery-looking fumaroles from which , every few minutes , came clouds of greenish gases accompanied by comic belching sounds and deeper , stranger subterranean groans . Here the sky was heavy with big-bellied clouds the color of dull pearls , and although the last of summer still held the land , there was a cool autumnal quality to the thin , sharp wind that blew from the north . The River Zimr , largest in Zimroel , divided Hot Khyntor from the city proper . When the travelers came upon it , the wagon emerging suddenly from an ancient district of narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Valentine gasped with amazement . " What is it ? " Carabella asked . " The river  --  I never expected it to be as big as this ! " " Are rivers unfamiliar to you ? " " There are none of any consequence between Pidruid and here , " he pointed out . " I remember nothing clearly before Pidruid . " " Compared with the Zimr , " said Sleet , " there are no rivers of any consequence anywhere . Let him be amazed . " To the right and left , so far as Valentine could see , the dark waters of the Zimr stretched to the horizon . The river was so broad here that it looked more like a bay . He could barely make out the square-topped towers of Khyntor on the far shore . Eight or ten mightyp154bridges spanned the waters here , so vast that Valentine wondered how it had been possible to build them at all . The one that lay directly ahead , Khyntor Bridge , was four highways wide , a structure of looping arches that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank to bank ; a short way downstream was a bridge of entirely different design , a heavy brick roadbed resting on astounding lofty piers , and just upstream was another that seemed made of glass , and gleamed with a dazzling brightness . Deliamber said , " That is Coronal Bridge , and to our right the Bridge of the Pontifex , and farther downstreamis the one known as the Bridge of Dreams . All of them are ancient and famous . " " But why try to bridge the river at a place where it 's so wide ? " Valentine asked in bewilderment . Deliamber said , " This is one of the narrowest points . " The Zimr 's course , declared the Vroon , was some seven thousand miles , rising northwest of Dulorn at the mouth of the Rift and flowing in a southeasterly direction across all of upper Zimroel toward the coastal city of Piliplok on the Inner Sea . This happy river , navigable for its entire length , was a swift and phenomenally broad stream that flowed in grand sweeping curves like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealthy cities , major inland ports , of which Khyntor was the most westerly . On the far side of Khyntor , running off to the northeast and only dimly visible in the cloudy sky , were the jagged peaks of the Khyntor Marches , nine great mountains on whose chilly flanks lived tribes of rough , high-spirited hunters . These people could be found in Khyntor much of the year , exchanging hides and meat for manufactured goods . That night in Khyntor , Valentine dreamed he was entering the Labyrinth to confer with the Pontifex . This was no vague and misty dream , but one with sharp , painful clarity . He stood under harsh winter sunlight on a barren plain , and saw before him a roofless temple with flat white walls , which Deliamber told him was the gateway to the Labyrinth . The Vroon and Lisamon Hultin were with him , and Carabella too , walking in a protective phalanx , but when Valentine stepped out onto the bare slate platform between those white walls he was alone . A being of sinister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but belonged to none of the non-human forms long settled on MajipoorneitherLiiman nor Ghayrog nor Vroon nor Skandar nor Hjort nor Su-Suheris , but something mysterious and disturbing , a muscular thick-armed creature with cratered red skin and a blunt dome of ' a head out of which blazed yellow eyes bright with almost , intolerablep155rage . This being demanded Valentine 's business with the Pontifex in a low , resonant voice . " Khyntor Bridge is in need of repair , " Valentine replied . " It is the ancient duty of the Pontifex to deal with such matters . " The yellow-eyed creature laughed . " Do you think the Pontifex will care ? " " It is my responsibility to summon his aid . " " Go , then . " The guardian of the portal beckoned with sardonic politeness and stepped aside . As Valentine went past , the being uttered a chilling snarl , and slammed shut a gateway behind Valentine . Retreatwas impossible . Before him lay a narrow winding corridor , sourcelesslylit by some cruel white light that numbed the eyes . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of the corridor widened , and he found himself in another roofless temple of white stone , or perhaps the same one as before , for the pockmarked redskinnedbeing again blocked his way , growling with that unfathomable anger . " Behold the Pontifex , " the creature said . And Valentine looked beyond it into a darkened chamber and saw the imperial sovereign of Majipoor seated upon a throne , clad in robes of black and scarlet , and wearing the royal tiara . And the Pontifex of Majipoor was a monster with many arms and many legs , and the face of a man but the wings of a dragon , and he sat shrieking and roaring upon the throne like a madman . A terrible whistling sound came from his lips , and the smell of the Pontifex was a frightful stink , and the black leathery wings flailed the air with fierce intensity , buffeting Valentine with cold gales . " Your majesty , " Valentine said , and bowed , and said , again , " Your majesty . " " Your lordship , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine and tugged him forward , and then Valentine was on the throne and the Pontifex , laughing insanely , was fleeing up the brightly lit corridors , running and flapping wings and raving and shrieking , until he was lost from sight . Valentine woke , wet with perspiration , in Carabella 's arms . She showed a look of concern bordering on fear , as if the terrors of his dream had been only too obvious to her , and she held him a moment , saying nothing , until he had had a chance to comprehend the fact that he was awake . Tenderly she stroked his cheeks . " You cried out three times , " she told him . " There are occasions , " he said after gulping a little wine from a flask beside the bed , " when it seems more wearying to sleep than to remain awake . My dreams are hard work , Carabella. "  | " There 's much in your soul that seeks to express itself , my lord . " " It expresses itself in a very strenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts . " If dreams are the source of wisdom , I pray to grow no wiser before dawn . " 9In Khyntor , Zalzan Kavol booked passage for the troupe aboard a riverboat bound toward Ni-moya and Piliplok . They would be journeyingonly a short way down the river , though , to the minor city of Verf , gateway to the Metamorph territory . Valentine regretted having to leave the riverboat at Verf , when he could easily , for another ten or fifteen royals , sail all the way to Piliplok and take ship for the Isle of Sleep . That , after all , and not the Shapeshifter reservation , was his most urgent immediate destination : the Isle of the Lady , where perhaps he might find confirmation of the visions that tormented him . But that was not to be , just yet . Destiny , Valentine thought , could not be rushed . Thus far things had moved with deliberate speed but toward some definite , if not alwaysunderstandable , goal . He was no longer the cheerful and simple idler of Pidruid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was he was becoming , he had a definite sense of inner transition , of boundaries passed and not to be recrossed . He saw himself as an actor in some vast and bewildering drama the climactic scenes of which wexe still far away in space and time . The riverboat was a grotesque and fanciful structure , but not without a beauty of sorts . Oceangoing ships such as had been in port at Pidruid were designed for grace and sturdiness , since they would face journeys of thousands of miles between harbors ; but the riverboat , a short-haul vessel , was squat and broad-beamed , more of a floating platform than a ship , and as if to compensate for the inelegance of its design its builders had festooned it with ornament  --  a great soaring bridge topped with triple figureheads painted in brilliant reds and yellows , an enormous central courtyard almost like a village plaza , with statuary and pavilions and game-parlors , and , at the stern , an upswept superstructure of many levels in which passengers were housed . Belowdecks were cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the crew , as well as the engine room , from which two gigantic smokestacks sprouted that came curving up the sides of the hull and rose skyward like the horns of a demon . The entire framep157of the ship was of wood , metal being too scarce on Majipoor for such large-scale enterprises and stone being generally deemed undesirable for maritime use ; and the carpenters had exerted their imaginations over nearly every square foot of the surface , decorating it with scrollwork , bizarre dadoes , outjutting joists , and similar flourishes of a hundredkinds . The riverboat seemed a vast and teeming microcosm . As they waited for sailing , Valentine and Deliamber and Carabella strolled the deck , thronged with citizens of many districts and of all the races of Majipoor . Valentine saw frontiersmen from the mountains beyond Khyntor , Ghayrogs in the finery affected in Dulorn , people of the humidsouthlands in cool white linens , travelers in sumptuous robes of crimson and green which Carabella said were typical of western Alhanroel , and many others . The ubiquitous Liimen sold their ubiquitous grilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riverboat line , giving information and instructions to those who asked and to many who did not ; a Su-Suheris family in diaphanous green robes , conspicuous because of their unlikely doubleheaded bodies and aloof , imperious mien , drifted like emissaries from the world of dreams through the crowds , who gave way in automatic deference . And there was one small group of Metamorphs on deck that afternoon . Deliamber saw them first . The little Vroon made a clucking sound and touched Valentine 's hand . " See them ? Let 's hope Sleet does n't . " " Which ones ? " Valentine asked . " By the railing . Standing alone , looking uneasy . They wear their natural form . " Valentine stared . There were five of them , perhaps a male and a female adult and three younger ones . They were slender , angular , long-legged beings , the older ones taller than he , with a frail , insubstantiallook to them . Their skins were sallow , almost green in hue . Their faces approached the human pattern in construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips were almost nonexistent and their noses were reduced to mere bumps , and their eyes , set on angles that sloped inward toward the center , were tapered and without pupils . Valentine was unable to decide whether these Metamorphs bore themselves with arrogance or with timidity : certainlythey must regard themselves as in hostile territory aboard this riverboat , these natives of the ancient race , these descendants of those who had possessed Majipoor before the coming of the first Earthborn settlers fourteen thousand years ago . He could not take his eyes from them . " How is the changing of shape accomplished ? " he asked  | " Their bones are not joined like those of most races , " answered Deliamber . " Under muscular pressure they will move and take up new patterns . Also they have mimicry cells in their skins , that allow them to alter color and texture , and there are other adaptations . An adult can transform itself almost instantaneously . " " And what purpose does this serve ? " " Who can say ? Most likely the Metamorphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe that are unable to shift shape . It must have some value to them . " " Very little , " said Carabella acidly , " if they could have such powersand still have their world snatched away from them . " " Shifting shape is not enough of a defense , " Deliamber replied , " when people travel from one star to another to steal your home . " The Metamorphs fascinated Valentine . To him they represented artifacts of Majipoor 's long history , archaeological relicts , survivors from the era when there were no humans here , nor Skandars nor Vroons nor Ghayrogs , only these fragile green people spread out across a colossal planet . Before the settlers came  --  the intruders , ultimately the conquerors . How long ago it had been ! He wished they would perform a transformation as he watched , perhaps turn into Skandars or Liimen before his eyes . But they remained unwavering in their identities . Shanamir , looking agitated , appeared suddenly out of the crowd . He seized Valentine 's arm and blurted , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the cargo-handlers talking . There 's a whole family of Shape  --  " " Not so loud , " Valentine said . " Look yonder . " The boy looked and shivered . " Scary things , they are . " " Where 's Sleet ? " " On the bridge , with Zalzan Kavol . They 're trying to get a permit to perform tonight . If he sees them  --  " " He 'll have to confront Metamorphs sooner or later , " Valentine murmured . To Deliamber he said , " Is it uncommon for them to be seen outside their reservation ? " " They are found everywhere , but never in great numbers , and rarely in their own form . There might be eleven of them living in Pidruid , say , and six in Falkynkip , nine in Dulorn  --  " " Disguised ? " " Yes , as Ghayrogs or Hjorts or humans , whatever seems best in a certain place . " The Metamorphs began to leave the deck . They moved with great dignity , but , unlike the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed rather to give an impression of wishing they were invisible . Valentine said , " Do they live in their territory by choice or compul-sion ? " " Some of each , I think . When Lord Stiamot completed the conquest , he forced them to leave Alhanroel entirely . But Zimroel was barely settled then , just the coastal outposts , and they were allowed most of the interior . They chose only the territory between the Zimr and the southern mountains , though , where access could easily be controlled , and withdrew into that . By now there 's a tradition that the Metamorphs dwell only in that territory , except for the unofficial few living out in the cities . But I have no idea whether that tradition has force of law . Certainly they pay little attention to the decrees that emerge from the Labyrinth or Castle Mount . " " If imperial law matters so little to them , are we not taking great risks in going to Ilirivoyne ? " Deliamber laughed . " The days when Metamorphs attacked outsidersfor the sheer love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are a shy and sullen people , but they will do us no harm , and we 'll probably leave their country intact and well laden with the money that Zalzan Kavol loves so much . Look , here he comes now . " The Skandar , with Sleet beside him , approached , looking self-satisfied . " We have arranged the right to perform , " he announced . " Fifty crowns for an hour 's work , right after dinner ! We 'll give them our simplest tricks , though . Why exert ourselves before we get to Iliri-voyne ? " " No , " Valentine said . " We should do our best . " He looked hard at Sleet . " There 's a party of Metamorphs aboard this boat . Perhaps they 'll carry the word of our excellence ahead of us to Ilirivoyne . " " Wisely argued , " said Zalzan Kavol. 1 Sleet was taut and fearful . His nostrils flickered , his lips compressed , he made holy signs with his left hand at his side . Valentine turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of healing begins . Juggle for them tonight as you would for the court of the Pontifex . " Hoarsely Sleet said , " They are my enemies ! " " Not these . They are not the ones of your dream . Those have done you all the damage that lay in their power , and it was long ago . " " It sickens me to be on the same boat . " " There 's no leaving it now , " Valentine said . " There are only fivep160of them . A small dose  --  good practice for meeting what awaits us in Ilirivoyne . " " Ilirivoyne  --  " " There is no avoiding Ilirivoyne , " said Valentine . " Your pledge to me , Sleet  --  " Sleet regarded Valentine in silence a moment . " Yes , my lord , " he whispered . " Come , then . Juggle with me : we both need practice . And remember to call me Valentine ! " They found a quiet place belowdecks and worked out with the clubs ; there was an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flawlessly , while Sleet was as clumsy as a tyro , dropping the clubs constantly and in several instances bruising his fingers . But in a few minutes his disciplines asserted themselves . He filled the air with clubs , interchanging them with Valentine in patterns of such complexity that it left Valentine laughing and gasping , and finally he had to beg a halt and ask Sleet to return to more manageable cascades . That night at the deckside performance  --  their first since the impromptuevent staged for the amusement of the forest-brethren  --  ZalzanKavol ordered a program that they had never done before an audience . The jugglers divided into three groups of three Sleet , Carabella , and Valentine ; Zalzan Kavol , Thelkar , and Gibor Haern ; Heitrag Kavol , Rovorn , and Erfon Kavol  --  and engaged in simultaneous triple exchanges in the same rhythm , one group of Skandars juggling knives , the other flaming torches , and the humans silver clubs . It was one of the most severe tests of his skills that Valentine had yet experienced . The symmetry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nine would ruin the total effect . He was the weakest link ; on him the entire impact of the performance depended , therefore . But he dropped no clubs , and the applause , when the jugglers had ended their act in a flurry of high throws and jaunty catches , was overwhelming . As he took his bows Valentine noticed the family of Metamorphs seated only a few rows away . He glanced at Sleet , who bowed and bowed again , ever more deeply . As they skipped from the stage Sleet said , " I saw them when we started , and then I forgot about them . I forgot about them , Valentine ! " He laughed . " They were nothing at all like the creature I remember from my dream . "  |p161The  troupe slept that night in a dank , crowded hold in the bowels of the riverboat . Valentine found himself jammed between Shanamir and Lisamon Hultin on the thinly cushioned floor , and the proximity of the warrior-woman seemed to guarantee that he would have no sleep , for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even than the snore was the fear that as her vast body rolled and thrashed about beside him he would be crushed beneath it . Several times indeed she fetched up against him and he was hard put to extricatehimself . But soon she lay more quietly , and he felt sleep stealing over him . A dream came in which he was Coronal , Lord Valentine of the olive skin and black beard , and sat once more in Castle Mount wielding the seals of power , and then somehow he was in a southern city , a moist steaming tropical place of giant vines and gaudy red blossoms , a city that he knew to be Til-omon at the far side of Zimroel , and he attended there a grand feast in his honor . There was another high guest at the table , a somber-eyed man with coarse skin , who was DomininBarjazid , second son of the King of Dreams , and Dominin Barjazid poured wine in honor of the Coronal , and offered toasts , crying out long life and predicting a glorious reign , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prestimion and Lord Confalume . And Lord Valentine drank , and drank again , and grew flushed and merry , and offered toasts of his own , to his guest and to the mayor of Til-omon and to the duke of the province , and to Simonan Barjazid the King of Dreams , and to the Pontifex Tyeveras , and to the Lady of the Isle , his own beloved mother , and the goblet was filled and filled once again , Iamber wine and red wine and the blue wine of the south , until finally he could drink no more , and went to his bedchamber and dropped instantly into sleep . As he slept figures moved about him , the men of Dominin Bar jazid 's entourage , lifting him and carrying him wrapped in silken sheets , taking him somewhere , and he could give no resistance , for it seemed to him that his arms and legs would not obey him , as if this were a dream , this scene within a dream . And Valentine beheld himself on a table in a secret room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fair , and it was Dominin Barjazid who wore the face of the Coronal . " Take him to some city in the far north , " said the false Lord Valentine , " and turn him loose , and let him make his own way upon the world . "  |p162The  dream would have continued , but Valentine found himself smothering in his sleep , and came up into consciousness to discover Lisamon Hultin sprawled against him with one of her beefy arms over his face . With some effort he freed himself , but then there was no returning to sleep . In the morning he said nothing to anyone of his dream : it was becoming time , he suspected , to keep the informations of the night to himself , for they were starting to border on affairs of state . This was the second time he had dreamed of having been supplanted as Coronal by Dominin Barjazid , and Carabella , weeks ago , had dreamed that enemies unknown had drugged him and stolen his identity . All these dreams might yet prove to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doubt that . There was too strong a consistency to them , too frequent a repetition of underlying structures . And if a Barjazid now wore the starburst crown ? What then , what then ? The Valentine of Pidruid would have shrugged and said , No matter , one overlord is the same as another ; but the Valentine now sailing from Khyntor to Verf took a more thoughtful view of things . There was a balance of power in this world , a balance carefully designed over a span of thousands of years , a system that had been evolving since Lord Stiamot 's time , or perhaps earlier , out of whatever forgotten polities had ruled Majipoor in the first centuries of the settlement . And in that system an inaccessible Pontifex ruled through the vehicle of a vigorous and dynamic Coronal of his own choosing , with the official known as the King of Dreams functioning to execute the commands of the government and chastise lawbreakers by virtue of his entry into the minds of sleepers , and the Lady of the Isle , mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was strength to the system , or else it could not have endured so many thousands of years ; under it , Majipoor was a happy and prosperous world , subject , true , to the frailties of flesh and the vagaries of nature , but mainly free of conflict and suffering . What now , Valentine wondered , if a Barjazid of the King 's blood were to put aside a lawfully constituted Coronal and interpose himself in that divinely ordained balance ? What harm to the commonwealth , what disruption of public tranquillity ? And what might be said of a fallen Coronal who chooses to accept his altered destiny and leaves the usurper unchallenged ? Was that not an abdication , and had there ever been an abdication of a Coronal in Majipoor 's history ? Would he not thereby become a co-conspirator in Dominin Barjazid 's overthrow of order ?  |p163The  last of his hesitations were going from him . It had seemed a comical thing , or a bizarre one , to Valentine the juggler when the first hints had come to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been an absurdity , a lunacy , a farce . No longer . The texture of his dreams carried the weight of plausibility . A monstrousthing had happened , indeed . The full import of it was only now coming clear to him . And it was his task , that he must accept without further question , to set things right . But how ? Challenge an incumbent Coronal ? Rise up in juggler 's costume to claim Castle Mount ? He spent the morning quietly , giving no hint of his thoughts . Mostly he remained at the rail , staring at the far-off shore . The river 's immensity was beyond his understanding : at some points here it was so wide that no land could be seen , and in other places what Valentine took to be the shore turned out to be islands , themselves of great size , with miles of water between their farther sides and the riverbank . The flow of the river was strong , and the huge riverboat was being swept rapidly along eastward . The day was bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the afternoon a light rain began to fall , out of clouds so compact that the sunlight remained bright around them . The rain increased in intensity and the jugglers were forced to cancel their second performance , to Zalzan Kavol 's great annoyance . They huddled under cover . That night Valentine took care to sleep beside Carabella , and left the snores of Lisamon Hultin for the Skandars to cope with . He waited almost eagerly for revealing new dreams . But what came to him was useless , the ordinary formless hodgepodge of fantasy and chaos , of nameless streets and unfamiliar faces , of bright lights and garish colors , of absurd disputes , disjointed conversations , and unfocusedimages , and in the morning the riverboat arrived at the port of Verf on the river 's southern bank . " The province of the Metamorphs , " said Autifon Deliamber , " is named Tiurifayne , after the name by which the Metamorphs call themselves in their own language , which is Piurivar . It is bounded on the north by the outlying suburb of Verf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south by the substantial range of ' mountains known as thep164Gonghars , and on the east by the River Steiche , an important tributary of the Zimr . I have beheld each of those boundary zones with my own eyes , though I have never entered Piurifayne itself . To enter is difficult , for the Velathys Scarp is a sheer wall a mile high and three hundred miles long ; the Gonghars are stormswept and disagreeable ; and the Steiche is a wild unruly river full of rapids and turbulence . The only rational way in is through Verf and down through Piurifayne Gate . " The jugglers now were only a few miles north of that entrance , having left the drab mercantile city of Verf as quickly as possible . The rain , light but insistent , had continued all morning . The countrysidehere was unexciting , a place of light sandy soil and dense stands of dwarf trees with pale green bark and narrow , twittering leaves . There was little conversation in the wagon . Sleet seemed lost in meditation , Carabella juggled three red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not driving engaged in some intricate game played with slivers of ivory and packets of black drole-whiskers , Shanamir dozed , Vinorkis made entries in a journal he carried , Deliamberentertained himself with minor incantations , the lighting of tiny necromantic candles , and other wizardly amusements , and LisamonHultin , who had hitched her mount to the team drawing the wagon so that she could come in from the rain , snored like a beached sea-dragon , awakening now and then to gulp a globelet of the cheap gray wine she had bought in Verf . Valentine sat in a corner , up against a window , thinking of Castle Mount . What could it be like , a mountain thirty miles high ? A single stone shaft rising like a colossal tower into the dark night of space ? If Velathys Scarp , a mile high , was as Deliamber said an impassable wall , what sort of barrier was a thing thirty times as tall ? What shadow did Castle Mount cast when the sun was in the east ? A dark stripe running the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope provided with warmth , and air to breathe ? Some machines of the ancients , Valentine had heard , that manufactured heat and light , and dispensed sweet air , miraculous machines of that forgotten technologicalera of thousands of years ago , when the old arts brought from Earth still were widely practiced here ; but he could no more comprehendhow such machines might work than he understood what forces operated the engines of memory in his own mind to tell him that this dark-haired woman was Carabella , this white-haired man Sleet . He thought too of Castle Mount 's highest reaches , and that building of forty thousand rooms at its summit , Lord Valentine 's Castle now , Lord Voriax ' not so long ago , Lord Malibor 's when he was a boy inp165that childhood he no longer remembered . Lord Valentine 's Castle ! Was there really such a place , or was the Castle and its Mount only a fable , a vision , a fantasy such as comes in dreams ? Lord Valentine 's Castle ! He imagined it clinging to the mountaintop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color just a few molecules thick , or so it would seem against the titanic scale of that impossible mountain , a splash that coursed irregularly down the flank of the summit in a tentacular way , hundreds of rooms extending on this face , hundreds more on that , a cluster of great chambers extending themselves pseudopodfashionhere , a nest of courtyards and galleries over there . And in its innermost place the Coronal in all grandeur , dark-bearded Lord Valentine , except that the Coronal would not be there now , he would still be making his grand processional through the realm , in Ni-moya ley now or some other eastern city . And I , thought Valentine , I once lived on that Mount ? Dwelled in that Castle ? What did I do , when I was Coronal  --  what decrees , what appointments , what duties ? The whole thing was inconceivable , and yet , and yet , he felt the conviction growing in him , there was fullness and density and substance to the phantom bits of memory that drifted through his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ni-moya by the river 's bend , as the false recollections planted in his mind had it , but rather in one of the Fifty Cities high up on the Mount , almost at the verge of the Castle itself , and that he had begin reared among the royal caste , among that cadre from which princes were chosen , that his childhood and boyhood had been one of privilege and comfort . He still had no memory of his father , who must have been some high prince of the realm , nor could he recall anything of his mother except that her hair was dark and her skin was swarthy , as his once had been , and  --  a memory rushed into his awareness out of nowhere  --  and that she had embraced him a long while one day , weeping a little , before she told him that Vorip , x had been chosen as Coronal in the place of the d rowned Lord Malibor , and she would go thenceforth to live as Lady on the Isle of Sleep . Was there truth to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been  --  Valentine paused , calculating  --  t wenty-two years old , very likely , when Voriax came to power . Would h is mother have embraced him at all ? Would she have wept , on becomingLady ? Or rather rejoice , that she and her eldest son were chosen Powers of Majipoor ? To weep and to rejoice at once , maybe . Valentine shook his head . These mighty scenes , these moments of potent history : would he ever regain access to them , or was he always to labor under the handicap placed upon him by those who had stolen his past ? There was a tremendous explosion in the distance , a long lowp166groundshaking boom that brought everyone in the wagon to attention . It continued for several minutes and gradually subsided to a quiet throb , then to silence . " What was that ? " Sleet cried , groping in the rack for an energythrower . " Peace , peace , " Deliamber said . " It is the sound of Piurifayne Fountain . We are approaching the boundary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see , " Deliamber told him . The wagon came to a halt a few minutes later . Zalzan Kavol turned round from the driver 's seat and yelled , " Where 's that Vroon ? Wizard , there 's a roadblock up ahead ! " " We are at Piurifayne Gate , " said Deliamber . A barricade made of stout glossy yellow logs lashed with a bright emerald twine spanned the narrow roadway , and to the left of it was a guardhouse occupied by two Hjorts in customs-official uniform of gray and green . They ordered everyone out of the wagon and into the rain , though they themselves were under a protective canopy . " Where bound ? " asked the fatter Hjort . " Ilirivoyne , to play at the Shapeshifter festival . We are jugglers , " said Zalzan Kavol . " Permit to enter Piurifayne Province ? " the other Hjort demanded . " No such permits are required , " Deliamber said . " You speak too confidently , Vroon . By decree of Lord Valentine the Coronal more than a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except on legitimate business . " " Ours is legitimate business , " growled Zalzan Kavol . " Then you would have a permit . " " But we knew nothing of the need for one ! " the Skandar protested . The Hjorts looked indifferent to that . They seemed ready to turn their attention to other matters . Zalzan Kavol glanced toward Vinorkis as though expecting him to have some sort of influence with his compatriots . But the Hjort merely shrugged . Zalzan Kavol glared at Deliamber next and said , " It falls within your responsibilities , wizard , to advise me of such matters . " The Vroon shrugged . " Not even wizards can learn of changes in the law that happen while they travel in forest preserves and other remote places . " " But what do we do now ? Turn back to Verf ? " The idea seemed to bring a glow of delight to Sleet 's eyes . Reprievedfrom this Metamorph adventure after all ! But Zalzan Kavolp167was fuming . Lisamon Hultin 's hand strayed to the hilt of her vibrationsword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zalzan Kavol , " Hjorts are not always incorrupti-ble . " " A good thought , " the Skandar murmured . Zalzan Kavol drew forth his money-pouch . Instantly the attention of the Hjorts sharpened . This was indeed the right tactic , Valentine decided . " Perhaps I have found the necessary document , " said Zalzan Kavol . Ostentatiously removing two one-crown pieces from the pouch , he caught a Hjort 's rough-skinned puffy hand in one of his , and with the others pressed a coin into each palm , smiling his most self-satisfied smile . The Hjorts exchanged glances , and they were not glances of bliss . Contemptuously they allowed the coins to fall to the muddy ground . " A crown ? " Carabella muttered in disbelief . " He expected to buy them with a crown ? " " Bribing an officer of the imperial government is a serious offense , " the fatter Hjort declared ominously . " You are under arrest and remanded for trial to Verf . Remain in your vehicle until appropriateescort can be found for you . " Zalzan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to Valentine , choked it off , gestured angrily at Deliamber , made a growling noise , and spoke in a low voice and in the Skandar language to the three nearest of his brothers . Lisamon Hultin again began to finger her sword-hilt . Valentine felt despair . There would be two dead Hjorts here in another moment , and the jugglers would all be criminal fugitives at the edge of Piurifayne . That was not likely to speed his journey to the Lady of the Isle . " Do something quickly , " Valentine said under his breath to AutifonDeliamber . But the Vroonish sorcerer was already in motion . Stepping forward , he snatched up the money and offered it again to the Hjorts , saying , " Your pardon , but you must have dropped these small coins . " He dropped them into the Hjorts ' hands , and at the same time allowed the tips of his tentacles to coil lightly about their wrists for an instant . When he released them , the thinner Hjort said , " Your visa is good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of this gate . Other exit points are illegal for you . " " Not to mention very dangerous , " added the other . He gestured and unseen figures pulled the barricade sideways fifteen feet along a buried track , so that there was room for the wagon to proceed.  |p168As  they entered the wagon Zalzan Kavol said furiously to Valentine , " In the future , give me no illegal advice ! And you , Deliamber : make yourself aware of the regulations that apply to us . This could have caused us great delay , and much loss of income . " " Perhaps if you had tried bribing with royals instead of crowns , " Carabella said beyond the Skandar 's range of hearing , " we would have had a simpler time of it . " " No matter , no matter , " Deliamber said . " We were admitted , were we not ? It was only a small sorcery , and cheaper than a heavy bribe . " " These new laws , " Sleet began . " So many decrees ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He wants to show his power . They always do . They decree this , they decree that , and the old Pontifex goes along with everything . This one decreed me right out of a job , do you know that ? " " How so ? " Valentine asked . " I was bodyguard to a merchant in Mazadone , much afraid of jealous rivals . This Lord Valentine placed a new tax on personal bodyguardsfor anyone below noble rank , amounting to my whole year 's salary ; and my employer , damn his ears , let me go on a week 's notice ! Two years , and it was goodbye , Lisamon , thank you very much , take a bottle of my best brandy as your going-away gift . " She belched resonantly . " One day I was the defender of his miserable life , the next I was a superfluous luxury , and all thanks to Lord Valentine ! Oh , poor Voriax ! D'ye think his brother had him murdered ? " " Guard your tongue ! " Sleet snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she persisted . " A hunting accident , was it ? And the last one , old Malibor , drowned while out fishing ? Why are our Coronals suddenlydying so strangely ? It never happened before like this , did it ? They went on to become Pontifex , they did , and hid themselves away in the Labyrinth and lived next to forever , and now here we have Malibor feeding the sea-dragons and Voriax taking a careless bolt in the forest . " She belched again . " I wonder . Up there on Castle Mount , maybe they 're getting too hungry for the taste of power . " " Enough , " Sleet said , looking uncomfortable with such talk . " Once a new Coronal 's picked , all the rest of the princes are finished , you know , no hope of advancement . Unless , unless , unless , unlessthe Coronal should die , and back they go into the hopper to be picked again . When Voriax died and this Valentine came to rule , I said  --  " " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full height , which was hardly chest-high to thep169warrior-woman , and his eyes blazed as if he planned to chop her off at the thighs to equalize matters between them . She remained at her ease , but her hand again was wandering toward her sword . Smoothly Valentine interposed himself . " She means no offense to the Coronal , " he said gently . " She is fond of wine , and it loosens her tongue . " And to Lisamon Hultin he said , " Forgive him , will you ? My friend is under strain in this part of the world , as you know . " A second enormous explosion , five times as loud and fifty times as frightening as the one that had occurred half an hour earlier , interruptedthe discussion . The mounts reared and squealed ; the wagon lurched ; Zalzan Kavol shouted ferocious curses from the driver 's seat . " Piurifayne Fountain , " Deliamber announced . " One of the great sights of Majipoor , well worth getting wet to see . " Valentine and Carabella rushed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an open place in the road , where the forest of little green-boled trees fell away to create a kind of natural amphitheater , completely without vegetation , running perhaps half a mile hack from the highway . At its farther end a geyser was in eruption , but a geyser that was to the ones Valentine had seen at Hot Khyntor as a sea-dragon is to a minnow . This was a column of frothing water that seemed taller than the tallest tower in Dulorn , a white shaft rising five hundred feet , six hundred , possibly even more , roaring out of ' the ground with incalculable force . At its upper end , where its unity broke and gave way to streamers and spouts and ropes of water that darted off in many directions , a mysterious light appeared to glow , kindling a whole spectrum of hues at the fringes of the column , pinks and pearls and crimsons and pale lavenders and opals . A warm spray filled the air . The eruption went on and on  --  an incredible volume of water driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire body massaged by the subterranean forces that were at work . He stared in awe and wonder , and it was almost with shock that he realized that the event was ending , the column now was shrinking , no more than four hundred feet , three hundred , now just a pathetic strand of white sinking toward the ground , now only forty feet , thirty , and then gone , gone , vacant air where that stunning shaft had been , dropletsof warm moisture as its only revenant . " Every thirty minutes , " Autifon Deliamber informed them . " As long as the Metamorphs have lived on Majipoor , so it is said , that geyser has never been a minute late . It is a sacred place to them . See ' ? There are pilgrims now . "  |p170Sleet  caught his breath and began making holy signs . Valentine put a steadying hand to his shoulder . Indeed Metamorphs , Shapeshifters , Piurivars , a dozen or more of them , gathered at a kind of wayside shrine not far ahead . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a particularly friendly way . Several of the aboriginesin the front of the group stepped briefly behind others , and when they reappeared they looked strangely blurred and indistinct , but that was not all , for they had undergone transformations . One had sprouted great cannonballs of breasts , in caricature of Lisamon Hultin , and another had grown four shaggy Skandar-arms , and another was mimickingSleet 's white hair . They made a curious thin sound which might have been the Metamorph version of laughter , and then the entire group slipped away into the forest . Valentine did not release his grip on Sleet 's shoulder until he felt some of the tension ebb from the little juggler 's rigid body . Lightly he said , " A good trick that is ! If we could do that  --  perhaps grow some extra arms in the middle of our act  --  what do you say , Sleet , would you like that ? " " I would like to be in Narabal , " Sleet said , " or Piliplok , or someplaceelse very far from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my mounts , " said Shanamir , who looked pale and shaken . " They mean us no harm , " Valentine said . " This will be an interestingexperience , one that we will never forget . " He smiled broadly . But there were no smiles about him , not even on Carabella , Carabella the inextinguishably buoyant . Zalzan Kavol himself looked oddly discomforted , as if perhaps he might now be having second thoughts about the wisdom of pursuing his love of royals into the Metamorph province . Valentine could not , by sheer force of optimistic energy alone , give his companions much cheer . He looked toward Deliamber . " How far is it to Ilirivoyne ? " he asked . " It lies somewhere ahead , " the Vroon replied . " How far , I have no idea . We will come to it when we come to it . " It was not an encouraging reply . This was primordial country , timeless , unspoiled , an outpost of time 's early dawn on civilized and housebroken Majipoor . The Shapesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downpours cleansed the air and let vegetation run riot . Out of the north came the frequent storms , down into that natural funnel formed by Velathys Scarp and the Gonghars ; and as the moist air rose in the ascent of the Gonghar foothills , gentle rains were released , that soaked the light spongy soil . Trees grew tall and slender-trunked , sprouting high and forming thick canopiesfar overhead ; networks of creepers and lianas tied the treetops together ; cascades of dark leaves , tapering , drip-tipped , glistened as if ' polished by the rain . Where there were breaks in the forest , Valentinecould see distant green-cloaked mist-wrapped mountains , heavyshouldered , forbidding , great mysterious bulks crouching on the land . Of ' wildlife there was little , at least not much that let itself be seen : un occasional red-and-yellow serpent slithering along a bough , an **27;7606;TOOLONG bird or toothy web-winged brown aeorlizard fluttering overhead , and once a frightened bilantoon that scampered delicately in front of the wagon and vanished into the woods with a flurry of its sharp little hooves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurked here , since several groves of dwikka-trees came into view . And no doubt the streams were thick with fish and reptiles , the forest floor teemed with burrowinginsects and rodents of fantastic hue and shape , and for all Valentineknew , each of the innumerable dark little lakes held its own monstrous submerged amorfibot , that arose by night to prowl , all neck and teeth and beady eyes , for whatever prey came within reach of its massive body . But none of these things made themselves apparent ns the wagon sped southward over the rough , narrow wilderness road . Nor were the Piurivars themselves much in evidence  --  now and then a well-worn trail leading into the jungle , or a few flimsy wickerworkhuts visible just off the road , or a party of half a dozen pilgrims heading on foot up toward the shrine at the Fountain . They were , ruiid Deliamber , a folk that lived by hunting and fishing , and collecting wild fruits and nuts , and a certain amount of agriculture . Possibly their civilization had once been more advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of large stone cities thousands of years old , that might have dated from early Piurivar times before the starships arrived  --  although , Deliamber said , there were some historianswho maintained that the ruins were those of ancient human et'tt Iernents , founded and destroyed in the turbulent pre-Pontifical periodtwelve to thirteen thousand years ago . At any rate the Metamorphs , if ' they had ever had a more complex way of life , now preferred to he forest-dwellers . Whether that was retrogression or progress Valentinecould not say.  |p172By  mid-afternoon the sound of Piurifayne Fountain could no longer be heard behind them , and the forest was more open , more thickly settled . The road was unmarked , and , unexpectedly , it forked in a place where no clues were to be had to anything beyond . Zalzan Kavol looked for guidance to Deliamber , who looked to Lisamon Hul tin . " Damn my gut if I could say , " the giantess boomed . " Pick one at random . We 've got a fifty-fifty chance of getting to Ilirivoyne on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mud to cast an inquiry-spell . He took from his pack a couple of cubes of a wizardy incense . Shielding them from the rain with his cloak , he ignitedthem to create a pale brown smoke . This he inhaled , while waving his tentacles in intricate curlicues . The warrior-woman snorted and said , " It 's only a fraud . He 'll wiggle his arms for a while and then he 'll make a guess . Fifty-fifty for Ilirivoyne . " " The left fork , " Deliamber announced eventually . It was good sorcery or else lucky guessing , for shortly signs of Metamorph occupation increased . There were no more isolated scatteringsof lonely huts , but now little clumps of wickerwork dwellings , eight or ten or more close together every hundred yards , and then even closer . There was much foot traffic too , mainly aboriginal children carrying light burdens in slings dangling from their heads . Many stopped as the wagon went by , and stared and pointed and made little chittering sounds between their teeth . Definitely they were approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and older Metamorphs , and dwellings were numerous . The children were an unsettling crew . They seemed to be practicing their immature skills at transformation as they walked along , and took many forms , most of them bizarre : one had sprouted legs like stilts , another had tentacular Vroonish arms that dangled almost to the ground , a third had swollen its body to a globular mass supported by tiny props . " Are we the circus entertainers , " Sleet asked , " or are they ? These people sicken me ! " " Peace , " Valentine said softly . In a grim voice Carabella said , " I think some of the entertainment s here are dark ones . Look . " Just ahead were a dozen large wicker cages by the side of the road . Teams of bearers , having apparently just put them down , were resting beside them . Through the bars of the cages small long-fingerer I hands were thrust , and some prehensile tails coiling in anguish . Asp173t he wagon drew alongside , Valentine saw that the cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on their way to Ilirivoynefor  --  what ? To be slaughtered for food ? To be tormented at the festival ? Valentine shivered . " Wait ! " Shanamir blurted , as they rode past the final cage . " What 's that in there ? " The last cage was bigger than the others , and what it held was no forest-brother , but rather some other sort of captive , a being of obvious intelligence , tall and strange , with dark blue skin , fierce and desolate purple eyes of extraordinary intensity and luminosity , and it wide , thin-lipped slash of a mouth . Its clothing  --  a fine green fabric  --  was ripped and tattered , and splotched with dark stains , possibly blood . It gripped the bars of its cage with terrible force , shaking and tugging at them , and cried out hoarsely at the jugglers for help in an odd , totally unfamiliar accent . The wagon went on . Chilled , Valentine said to Deliamber , " That is no being of Maji-poort " . " No , " Deliamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I saw one once , " Lisamon Hultin put in . " An offworlder , native to some star close by here , though I forget the name of it . " " But what would offworlders be doing here ? " Carabella asked . " There 's little traffic between the stars these days , and few ships come to Majipoor . " " Still , some do , " Deliamber said . " We 're not yet totally cut off from the starlanes , though certainly we 're considered a backwater in the commerce of the worlds . And  --  " " Are you all mad ? " Sleet burst out in exasperation . " Sitting here like scholars , discussing the commerce between the worlds , and in that cage is a civilized being crying for help , who probably will be stewed and eaten at the Metamorph festival ? And we pay no attention to its cries , but ride blithely onward into their city ? " He made a tormentedsound of anger and went rushing forward to the Skandars on the driver 's seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleet tugged at Zalzan Kavol 's cloak . " Did you see it ? " he demanded . " Did you hear ? The offworlder in the cage ? " Without turning , Zalzan Kavol said , " So ? " " You 'll ignore its cries ? " " This is no affair of ours , " the Skandar replied evenly . " Shall we liberate the prisoners of an independent people ? They must have some reason for arresting that being . " " Reason ? Yes , to cook him for dinner ! And we 'll be in the next pot I ask you to go back and release  --  "  | " Impossible . " " At least let 's ask of it why it 's caged ! Zalzan Kavol , we may be riding blithely to our deaths ! Are you in such a hurry to reach Ilirivoynethat you 'll ride right past someone who may know something about conditions here , and who is in such a plight ? " " What Sleet says has wisdom in it , " Valentine remarked . " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon to ahalt . " Go and investigate , Valentine . But be quick about it . " " I 'll go with him , " Sleet said . " Stay here . If he feels he needs a bodyguard , let him take the giantess . " That seemed sensible . Valentine beckoned to Lisamon Hultin , and they got down from the wagon and strode back toward the place of the cages . Instantly the forest-brethren set up a frantic screeching and a banging on their bars . The Metamorph bearers  --  armed , Valentinenoticed now , with effective-looking short dirks of polished horn or wood  --  unhurriedly formed themselves into a phalanx in the road , keeping Valentine and Lisamon Hultin from a closer approach to the large cage . One Metamorph , plainly the leader , stepped forward and waited with menacing calmness for inquiries . Valentine said quietly to the giantess , " Will he speak our lan-guage ? " " Probably . Try it . " " We are a troupe of roving jugglers , " Valentine said in a loud , clear voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold at Ilirivoyne . Are we near Ilirivoyne now ? " The Metamorph , half a head taller than Valentine , though much flimsier of build , seemed amused . " You are in Ilirivoyne , " was the cool , remote reply . Valentine moistened his lips . These Metamorphs gave off a thin , sharp odor , acrid but not disagreeable . Their strangely sloped eyes were frighteningly expressionless . He said , " To whom would we go to make arrangements for performing in Ilirivoyne ? " " The Danipiur interviews all strangers who come to Ilirivoyne . You will find her at the House of Offices . " The Metamorph 's frosty self-contained manner was disconcerting . After a moment Valentine said , " One thing more . We see that in that large cage you keep a being of an unfamiliar sort . May I ask , for what purpose ? " " Punishment . " " A criminal ? " " So it is said , " the Metamorph replied distantly . " Why does this concern you ? "  | " We are strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , we might prefer to find employment somewhere else . " There was a flicker of some emotion  --  amusement ? contempt ?  --  around the Metamorph 's mouth and nostrils . " Why should you fear such a thing ? Are you criminals ? " " Hardly . " " Then you will not be caged . Pay your respects to the Danipiur and address further questions to her . I have important tasks to com-plete . " Valentine looked toward Lisamon Hultin , who shrugged . The Metamorph walked away . There was nothing more to do but return to the wagon . The bearers were lifting the cages and fastening them to poles laid across their backs . From the large cage came a roar of anger and despair . Ilirivoyne was neither a city nor a village , but something intermediate , a forlorn concentration of many low , impermanent-looking structures of withes and light woods , arranged along irregular unpaved streets that seemed to stretch for considerable distances into the forest . The place had a makeshift look , as though Ilirivoyne might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altogether other district a few years hence . That it was festival-time in Ilirivoyne was signaled , apparently , by fetish-sticks of some sort planted in front of almost every house , thick shaven stakes to which bright ribbons and hits of fur had been attached ; also on many streets scaffolding had been erected , as for performances , or , thought Valentine uneasily , for tribal rites of some darker kind . Finding the House of Offices and the Danipiur was simple . The main street opened into a broad plaza bordered on three sides by small domed buildings with ornately woven roofs , and on the fourth by a larger structure , the first three-story building they had seen in Ilirivoyne , with an elaborate garden of globular thick-stemmed grayrrnd-whiteshrubs in front of it . Zalzan Kavol drew the wagon into a clearing just outside the plaza . " Come with me , " the Skandar said to Deliamber . " We 'll see what we can arrange . " They were inside the House of Offices a long while . When they emerged , a female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Danipiur , and the three stood together by the garden in elaborate conversation . The Danipiur pointed ; Zalzan Kavol alternately nodded and shook his head ; Autifon Deliamber , dwarfed between the two tall beings , made frequent graceful gestures of diplomatic conciliation . Finally Zalzan Kavol and the Vroon returned to the wagon . The Skandar 's mood seemed brighter . " We 've come just in time , " he announced . " The festival has alreadybegun . Tomorrow night is one of the major holidays . " " Will they pay us ? " Sleet asked . " So it would seem , " said Zalzan Kavol . " But they will supply us with no food , and no lodging either , for Ilirivoyne is without hostelries . And there are certain specified zones of the city that we may not enter . I have had friendlier welcomes in other places . But also less friendly ones now and then , I suppose . " Crowds of solemn , silent Metamorph children trailed after them as they moved the wagon from the plaza to an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late afternoon they held a practice session , and though Lisamon Hultin did her formidable best to clear the young Metamorphs from the scene and keep them away , it was impossible to prevent them from slipping back , emerging between trees and out of bushes to stare at the jugglers . Valentine found it unnerving to work in front of them , and he was plainly not the only one , for Sleet was tense and uncharacteristically awkward , and even Zalzan Kavol , the master of masters , dropped a club for the first time in Valentine 's memory . The silence of the children was disturbing  --  they stood like blank-eyed statues , a remote audience that drained energy and gave none in return  --  but even more troublesome was their trick of metamorphosis , their way of slipping from one shape to another as casually as a human child might suck its thumb . Mimicry was their apparent purpose , for the forms they took were crude , half-recognizable versions of the jugglers , such as the older Metamorphs had attempted earlier at Piurifayne Fountain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble  --  but in the pauses between routines Valentinesaw them now sprouting golden hair for him , white for Sleet , black for Carabella , or making themselves bearish and many-armed like the Skandars , or trying to imitate faces , individual features , expressions , everything done in a distorted and unflattering way . The travelers slept crammed aboard the wagon that night , one packed close upon the other , and all night , so it seemed , a steady rain fell . Valentine only occasionally was able to sleep ; he dropped into light dozes , but mainly he lay awake listening to Lisamon llultin 's lusty snoring or the even more grotesque sounds coming from thep177Skandars . Somewhere in the night he must have had some real sleep , fir- a dream came to him , hazy and incoherent , in which he saw the Metamorphs leading a procession of prisoners , forest-brethren and t he blue-skinned alien , up the road toward Piurifayne Fountain , which erupted and rose above the world like a colossal white mountain . And again toward morning he slept soundly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder a little before dawn . Valentine sat up , rubbing his eyes . " What is it ? " " Come outside . I have to talk . " " It 's still dark ! " " Even so . Come ! " Valentine yawned , stretched , got creakily to his feet . He and Sleet picked their way carefully over the slumbering forms of Carabella and Shanamir , went warily around one of the Skandars , and down the steps of the wagon . The rain had stopped , but the morning was dark and chilly , and a nasty fog rose from the ground . " I have had a sending , " Sleet said . " From the Lady , I think . " " Of what sort ? " " About the blue-skinned one , in the cage , that they said was a criminal going to be punished . In my dream he came to me and said he was no criminal at all , but only a traveler who had made the error of entering Shapeshifter territory , and had been captured because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at festival-time . And I saw how it is done , the victim bound hand and foot and left in the basin of the Fountain , and when the explosion comes he is hurled far into the sky . " Valentine felt a chill that did not come from the morning mist . " I dreamed something similar , " he said . " In my dream I heard more , " Sleet went on . " That we are in danger too , not perhaps from sacrifice but in danger all the same . And if we rescue the aJien , he will help us to safety , but if we leave him to die , we will not leave Piurivar country alive . You know I fear these Shapeshifters , Valentine , but this dream is something new . It wane to me with the clarity of a sending . It ought not be dismissed era more fears of foolish Sleet . " " What do you want to do ? " " Rescue the alien . " Valentine said uneasily , " And if he really was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice ? " " By right of sending , " said Sleet . " Are those forest-brethren criminalstoo ? I saw them also go into the Fountain . We are among savages , Valentine . "  | " Not savages , no . But strange folk , whose way is not like the ways of Majipoor . " " I 'm determined to set the blue-skinned one free . If not with your help , then by myself . " " Now ? " " What better time ? " Sleet asked . " It 's still dark . Quiet . I 'll open the cage ; he 'll slip off into the jungle . " " You think the cage is unguarded ? No , Sleet . Wait . This makes no sense . You 'll jeopardize us all if you act now . Let me try to find out more about this prisoner and why he 's caged , and what 's intended for him . If they do mean to sacrifice him , they 'd do it at some high point of the festival . There 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sleet said . " I dreamed a dream something like yours . " " But not a sending . " " Not a sending , no . Still , enough to let me think your dream holds truth . I 'll help you , Sleet . But not now . This is n't the moment for it . " Sleet looked restless . Clearly in his mind he was already on the way to the place of the cages , and Valentine 's opposition was thwarting him . " Sleet ? " " Yes ? " " Hear me . This is not the moment . There is time . " Valentine looked steadily at the juggler . Sleet returned his gaze with equal steadfastness for a moment ; then , abruptly , his resolve broke and he lowered his eyes . " Yes , my lord , " he said quietly . During the day Valentine tried to gain information about the prisoner , but with little success . The cages , eleven holding forestbrethrenand the twelfth holding the alien , now had been installed in the plaza opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alien 's cage alone on high , far above the ground . Piurivars armed with dirks guarded them . Valentine approached , but he was only halfway across the plaza when he was stopped . A Metamorph told him , " This is forbidden for you to enter . " The forest-brethren began frantically to rattle their bars . The blue-skinned one called out , thickly accented words that Valentine could barely understand . Was the alien saying , " Flee , fool , before they kill you too ! " or was that only Valentine 's heightened imagination at work ? The guards held a tight cordon around the place . Valentinep179turned away . He attempted to ask some children nearby if they could explain the cages to him ; but they looked at him in obstinate silence , giving him cool blank-eyed stares and murmuring to one another and making little partial metamorphoses that mimicked his fair hair , and then they scattered and ran as though he were some sort of demon . All morning long Metamorphs entered Ilirivoyne , swarming in from the outlying forest settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buntings and draperies and mirrorbedeckedposts and tall poles carved with mysterious runes ; everyone seemed to know what to do , and everyone was intensely busy . No rain fell after sunrise . Was it by witchcraft , Valentine wondered , that the Piurivars provided a rare dry day for their high holiday , or only coincidence ? By mid-afternoon the festivities were under way . Small bands of musicians played heavy , pulsating , jangling music of eccentric rhythm , and throngs of Metamorphs danced a slow and stately pattern of interweavings , moving almost like sleepwalkers . On certain streets races were run , and judges stationed at points along the course engaged in intricate arguments as the racers went past them . Booths apparentlyconstructed during the night dispensed soups , stews , beverages , and grilled meats . Valentine felt like an intruder in this place . He wanted to apologizeto the Metamorphs for having come among them at their holiest t i me . Yet no one but the children seemed to be paying the slightest attention to them , and the children evidently regarded them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurked everywhere , flashing jumbled imitations of Deliamber and Sleet and Zalzan Kavol and the rest , but never allowing anyone to get close to t hem . Zalzan Kavol had called a rehearsal for late afternoon , back oft he wagon . Valentine was one of the first to arrive , glad of an excuse to remove himself from the crowded streets . He found only Sleet and two of the Skandars . It seemed to him that Zalzan Kavol was eyeing him in an odd way . There was something new and disturbing about the quality of the Skandar 's attentiveness . After a few minutes Valentine was so troubled by it that he said , " Is something wrong ? " " What would be wrong ? " " You seem out of ' countenance . " " I ' ? I ? Nothing 's the matter . A dream , is all . I was thinking ona dream I had last night . " You dreamed of ' the blue-skinned prisoner ? "  |p180Zalzan  Kavol looked baffled . " Why do you think that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing at all to do with the blue-skinned one , " the Skandar replied . " Nor do I wish to discuss it . It was foolishness , mere foolishness . " And Zalzan Kavol , moving away , picked up a double brace of knives and began to juggle them in an edgy , absent-minded way . Valentine shrugged . It had not even occurred to him that Skandars had dreams , let alone that they might have troublesome ones . But of course : they were citizens of Majipoor , they shared in all the attributesof people here , and so they must live full and rich dream-lives like everyone else , with sendings from King and Lady , and stray intrusionsfrom the minds of lesser beings , and upwellings of self from their own deeper reaches , even as humans did , or , Valentine supposed , Hjorts and Vroons and Liimen . Still , it was curious . Zalzan Kavol was so guarded of emotion , so unwilling to let anything of himself be seen by others save greed and impatience and irritation , that Valentinefound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was pondering a dream . He wondered if Metamorphs had meaningful dreams , and sendings , and all of that . The rehearsal went well . Afterward the jugglers made a light and not very satisfying dinner of fruits and berries that Lisamon Hultinhad gathered in the forest , and washed it down with the last of the wine they had brought from Khyntor . Bonfires now were blazing in many streets of Ilirivoyne , and the discordant music of the various bands set up weird clashing near-harmonies . Valentine had assumed the performance would take place in the plaza , but no , Metamorphs in what perhaps were priestly costumes came at darkness to escort them to some entirely other part of town , a much larger oval clearing that already was ringed by hundreds or even thousands of expectant onlookers . Zalzan Kavol and his brothers went over the ground carefully , checking for pitfalls and irregularities that might disrupt their movements . Sleet usually took part in that , but , Valentine noticed abruptly , Sleet had vanished somewhere between the rehearsal place and this clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to do something rash ? Valentine was just about to set out in search when Sleet appeared , breathing lightly as though he had just been jogging . " I went to the plaza , " he said in a low voice . " The cages are still piled up . But most of the guards must be off at the dancing . I was able to exchange a few words with the prisoner before I was chased . "  | " And ? " " He said he 's to be sacrificed at midnight in the Fountain , exactly as in my sending . And tomorrow night the same will happen to us . " " What ? " " I swear it by the Lady , " said Sleet . His eyes were like augers . " It was under pledge to you , my lord , that I came into this place . You assured me no harm would befall me . " " Your fears seemed irrational . " " And now ? " " I begin to revise my opinion , " Valentine said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . I pledge you that . I 'll speak with Zalzan Kavol after the performance , and after I 've had a chance to confer with Deliamber . " " It would please me more to get on the road sooner . " " The Metamorphs are feasting and drinking this evening . They 'll be less likely to notice our departure later , " said Valentine , " and less apt to pursue us , if pursuit is their aim . Besides , do you think Zalzan Kavol would agree to cancel a performance merely on the rumor of danger ? We 'll do our act , and then we 'll begin to extricate ourselves . What do you say ? " " I am yours , my lord , " Sleet replied . It was a splendid performance , and no one was in better form than Sleet , who did his blind juggling routine and carried it off flawlessly . The Skandars flung torches at one another with giddy abandon , Carabellacavorted on the rolling globe , Valentine juggled while dancing , skipping , kneeling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying little , never applauding , peering in at them out of the foggy darkness with unfathomable intensity of concentration . Working to such an audience was hard . It was worse than working in rehearsal , for no one expects an audience then , but now there were thousands of spectators and they were giving nothing to the performers ; they were statue-still , as the children had been , an austere audiencethat offered neither approval nor disapproval but only something that had to be interpreted as indifference . In the face of that , the jugglers presented ever more taxing and marvelous numbers , but for more than an hour they could get no response.  |p182And  then , astoundingly , the Metamorphs began a juggling act of their own , an eerie dreamlike counterfeit of what the troupe had been doing . By twos and threes they came forward from the darkness , taking up positions in the center of the ring only a few yards from the jugglers . As they did so they swiftly shifted forms , so that six of them now wore the look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lithe and much like Carabella , and one had Sleet 's compact form , and one , yellow-haired and tall , wore the image of Valentine . There was nothing playful about this donning of the jugglers ' bodies : to Valentine it seemed ominous , mocking , distinctly threatening , and when he looked to the side at the non-performing members of the troupe he saw AutifonDeliamber making worried gestures with his tentacles , Vinorkis scowling , and Lisamon Hultin rocking evenly back and forth on the balls of her feet as if readying herself for combat . Zalzan Kavol looked disconcerted also by this development . " Continue , " he said in a ragged tone . " We are here to perform for them . " " I think , " said Valentine , " we are here to amuse them , but not necessarily as performers . " " Nevertheless , we are performers , and we will perform . " He gave a signal and launched , with his brothers , into a dazzling interchange of multitudinous sharp and dangerous objects . Sleet , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to throw them in cascades , as did Carabella . Valentine 's hands were chilled ; he felt no willingness in them to juggle . The nine Metamorphs alongside them were beginning to juggle now too . It was only counterfeit juggling , dream juggling , with no true art or skill to it . It was mockery and nothing more . They held in their hands rough-skinned black fruits , and bits of wood , and other ordinary things , and threw them from hand to hand in a child 's parody of juggling , now and again failing to make even those simple catches and bending quickly to retrieve what they had dropped . Their performancearoused the audience as nothing that the true jugglers had done had managed to do . The Metamorphs now were humming  --  was this their form of applause ?  --  and rocking rhythmically , and clapping hands to knees , and , Valentine saw , some of them were transforming themselves almost at random , taking on odd alternate forms , human or Hjort or Su-Suheris as the whim struck , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At one point he saw six or seven Valentines in the rows nearest him.  |p183Performing  was all but impossible in such a circus of distractions , but the jugglers clung grimly to their routines for some minutes more , doing poorly now , dropping clubs , missing beats , breaking up longfamiliarcombinations . The humming of the Metamorphs grew in intensity . " Oh , look , look ! " Carabella cried suddenly . She gestured toward the nine mock jugglers , and pointed at the one who represented Valentine . Valentine gasped . What the Metamorph was doing defied all comprehension , and struck him rigid with terror and astonishment . For it had begun to oscillate between two forms . One was the Valentine-image , the tall , wide-shouldered , big-handed , golden-haired young man . And the other was the image of Lord Valentine the Coronal . The metamorphosis was almost instantaneous , like the flashing of a light . One moment Valentine saw his twin before him , and the next instant there was , in his place , the black-bearded fierce-eyed Coronal , a figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple juggler was back . The humming of the crowd became louder : they approved of the show . Valentine . . . Lord Valentine . . . Valentine . . . Lord Valentine . . . As he watched , Valentine felt a trail of icy chill go down his back , felt his scalp prickle , his knees quiver . There was no mistaking thee import of this bizarre pantomime . If ever he had hoped for confirmation of all that had swept through him these weeks since Pidruid , He was getting it now . But here ? In this forest town , among these abhoriginal folk ? He looked into his own mimicked face . He looked into the face of the Coronal . The other eight jugglers leaped and pranced in a nightmarish dance , their legs rising high and stamping down , the false Skandarrerrrrswaving and thumping against their sides , the false Sleet-hair and Carabella-hair wild in the night wind , and the Valentine-figure remained still , alternating one face and the other , and then it was over ; nine Metamorphs stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the audience , and the rest of the Piurivars were on their feet and dancing in the same wild way . The performance was ended . Still dancing , the Metamorphs streamed out into the night , toward the booths and games of their festival . Valentine , stunned , turned slowly and saw the frozen , astonished titres of his companions . Zalzan Kavol 's jaw sagged , his arms dangledp184limply . His brothers clustered close behind him , their eyes wide in awe and shock . Sleet looked frighteningly pale ; Carabella the opposite , her cheeks flushed , almost feverish . Valentine held out a hand toward them . Zalzan Kavol came stumbling forward , dazed , all but tripping over his own feet . The giant Skandar paused a few feet from Valentine . He blinked , he ran his tongue over his lips , he seemed to be working hard to make his voice function at all . Finally he said , in a tiny , preposterous voice : " My lord . . . ? " First Zalzan Kavol and then his five brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands Zalzan Kavol made the starburst symbol ; his brothers did the same . Sleet , Carabella , Vinorkis , Deliamber , all knelt as well . The boy Shanamir , looking frightened and baffled , stared open-mouthed at Valentine . He seemed paralyzed with wonder and surprise . Slowly he bent to the ground also . Lisamon Hultin cried out , " Have you all gone crazy ? " " Down and pay homage ! " Sleet ordered her hoarsely . " You saw it , woman ! He is the Coronal ! Down and pay homage ! " " The Coronal ? " she repeated in confusion . Valentine stretched his arms out over them all in a gesture that was as much one of comfort as blessing . They were frightened of him and of what had just befallen ; so too was he , but his fear was passing quickly , and in its place came strength , conviction , sureness . The sky itself seemed to cry at him : You are Lord Valentine who was Coronal on Castle Mount , and you shall have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through him now flowed the power of his former imperial office . Even here , in this rainswept remote hinterland , in this ramshackle aboriginal town , here with the sweat of juggling still on his body , here in these coarse common clothes , Valentine felt himself to be what he once had been , and although he did not understand what metamorphosis had been worked on him to make him what he now was , he no longer questioned the reality of the messages that had come in dreams . And he felt no guilt , no shame , no deceitfulness , at receiving this homage from his stupefied companions . " Up , " he said gently . " All of you . On your feet . We must get out of this place . Shanamir , round up the mounts . Zalzan Kavol , get the wagon ready . " To Sleet he said , " Everyone should be armed . Energy-throwers for those who know how to use them , juggling knives for the rest . See to it . " Zalzan Kavol said heavily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor of a dream . To think that all these weeks I traveled with  --  to think I spoke roughly to  --  that I quarreled with  --  "  | " Later , " Valentine said . " We have no time for discussing these things now . " He turned to Lisamon Hultin , who seemed busy in some conversation with herself , moving her lips , gesturing , explaining things to herself , debating these bewildering events . In a quiet , forceful voice Valentinesaid , " You were hired only to bring us as far as Ilirivoyne . I need you to give us your strength as we escape . Will you stay with us to Ni-moya and beyond ? " " They made the starburst at you , " she said puzzledly . " They all kneeled . And the Metamorphs  --  they  --  " " I was once Lord Valentine of Castle Mount . Accept it . Believe it . The realm has fallen into dangerous hands . Remain at my side , Lisamon , as I journey east to set things right . " She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amazement . Then she began to sag into an homage , but he shook his head , caught her by the elbow , would not let her kneel . " Come , " he said . " ' That does n't matter now . Out of here ! " They gathered up their juggling gear and sprinted through the darkness toward the wagon , far across town . Shanamir and Carabella had already taken off , and were running well ahead . The Skandars moved in a single ponderous phalanx , shaking the ground beneath them ; Valentine had never seen them move so quickly before . He ran just behind them , alongside Sleet . Vinorkis , splay-footed and slow , struggled to keep pace with them . To the rear was Lisamon Hultin . She had scooped up Deliamber and was carrying the little wizard perched in the crook of her left arm ; in her right she bore her **25;7635;TOOLONG . As they neared the wagon Sleet said to Valentine , " Shall we free the prisoner ? " " Yes . " He beckoned to Lisamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Sleet in the lead , they ran toward the plaza . To Valentine 's relief it was all but empty , no more than a handful of Piurivar guards on duty . The twelve cages still were stacked in tiers at the far end , four on the bottom , then rows of four and three , and the one containing the blue-skinned alien perched on top . Before the guards could react Lisamon Hultin was among them , seizing them two at a time and hurling them far across the plaza.  --  Take no lives , " Valentine warned . Sleet , monkey-swift , was scrambling up the stack of cages . Hep186reached the top and began to cut through the thick withes that held the cage door shut . With brisk sawing motions of the knife he slashed while Valentine held the withes taut . In a moment the last of the fibers was severed and Valentine hoisted the door . The alien clambered out , stretching his cramped limbs and looking questioningly at his rescuers . " Come with us , " Valentine said . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand ? " " I understand , " said the alien . His voice was deep , harsh , resonant , with a sharp clipped edge to each syllable . Without another word he swung himself down past the cages of the forest-brethren to the ground , where Lisamon Hultin had finished dealing with the Metamorphguards and was piling them tidily in a heap . Impulsively Valentine sliced through the lashings on the cage of forest-brethren nearest to him . The busy little hands of the creatures reached through the bars and pulled the latch , and out they came . Valentine went on to the next cage . Sleet had already descended . " One moment , " Valentine called . " The job 's not quite done . " Sleet drew his knife and set to work . In moments all the cages were open , and the forest-brethren , dozens of them , were disappearing into the night . As they ran to the wagon Sleet said , " Why did you do that ? " " Why not ? " Valentine asked . " They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon ready to go , the mounts hitched , the rotors turning . Lisamon Hultin was the last one in ; she slammed the door behind her and yelled to Zalzan Kavol , who took off immediately . And just in time , for half a dozen Metamorphs appeared and began running frantically after them , shouting and gesticulating . Zalzan Kavolstepped up the wagon 's speed . Gradually the pursuers fell behind and were lost to sight as the wagon entered the utter darkness of the jungle . Sleet peered worriedly back . " Do you think they 're still following us ? " " They ca n't keep up with us , " said Lisamon Hultin . " And they travel only by foot . We 're safely out of there . " " Are you sure ? " Sleet asked . " What if they have some side route to take in catching up with us ? " " Worry about that when we must , " said Carabella . " We 're moving quickly . " She shuddered . " And let it be a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . The wagon glided swiftly onward.  |p187Valentine  sat slightly apart from the others . It was inevitable , yet it distressed him , for he was still more Valentine than Lord Valentine , and it was strange and disagreeable to set himself up above his friends . But there was no helping it . Carabella and Sleet , learning privately of his identity , had come to terms with it privately in their own ways ; Deliamber , who had known the truth before Valentine himself , had never been overly awed by it ; but the others , whatever suspicions they may have had that Valentine was something more than a happy-go-lucky wanderer , were dumfounded by the open acknowledgment of his rank that had come out of the grotesque Metamorphperformance . They stared ; they were speechless ; they sat in stiff , unnatural postures , as if afraid to slouch in the presence of a Coronal . But how should one behave in the presence of a Power of Majipoor ? They could not sit here constantly making starbursts at him . The gesture seemed absurd to Valentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : his growing sense of his own importance did not seem to include much spirit of self-importance yet . The alien introduced himself as Khun of Kianimot , a world of a star relatively close by Majipoor . He seemed a dark and brooding sort , with a crystalline anger and despair at his core , something integralto his being , that expressed itself , Valentine thought , in the set of ' his lips and the tone of his voice and particularly in the intense gaze of his strange , haunted purple eyes . Of course it was possible , Valentine conceded , that he was projecting his own human notions of ' expression onto this alien being , and that perhaps Khun was , as Kianimot folk went , a person of total jollity and amiability . But he doubted that . Khun had come to Majipoor two years before , on business that he chose not to explain . It was , he said bitterly , the greatest mistake of his life , for among the merry Majipoorans he had been parted from all his money , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no starport on that continent from which he could depart for his home world , and he had even more foolishly ventured into Piurivar territory , thinking he could recoup his losses in some sort of trade with the Metamorphs . But they had seized him instead and thrust him in the cage , and held him prisoner for weeks , meaning to give him to the Fountain on the high night of their festival . " Which would perhaps have been best , " he said . " One quick blast of ' water and all this wandering would be at an end . Majipoor makes me weary . If I am destined to die on this world of yours , I think I would prefer it to be soon . "  | " Pardon us for rescuing you , " Carabella said sharply . " No . No . I mean no ingratitude . But only  --  " Khun paused . " This place has been grief for me . So too was Kianimot . Is there any place in the universe where life does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Carabella . " We find it tolerable here . Even the worst is tolerable enough , considering the alternative . " She laughed . " Are you always this gloomy ? " The alien shrugged . " If you are happy , I admire and envy you . I find existence painful and life meaningless . But these are dark thoughts for one who has just been rescued . I thank you for your aid . Who are you , and what rashness brought you to Piurifayne , and where do you go now ? " " We are jugglers , " said Valentine , with a sharp glance at the others . " We came to this province because we thought there was work for us here . And if we succeed in getting away from this place , we 'll head for Ni-moya , and down the river to Piliplok . " " And from there ? " Valentine gestured vaguely . " Some of us will make the pilgrimage to the Isle . Do you know what that is ? And the others  --  I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must reach Alhanroel , " Khun said . " My only hope lies in going home , which is impossible from this continent . In Piliplok perhaps I can arrange passage across the sea . May I travel with you ? " " Of course . " " I have no money . " " We see that , " said Valentine . " It makes no difference . " The wagon moved on swiftly through the night . No one slept , except in occasional quick naps . A light rain was falling now . In the darkness of the forest , dangers might lie on any side , but there was a paradoxical comfort in not being able to see anything , and the wagon sped on unmolested . After an hour or so Valentine looked up and saw Vinorkis standing before him , gaping like a gaffed fish and quivering with what must be unbearable tension . " My lord ? " he said in a tiny voice . Valentine nodded to the Hjort . " You 're trembling , Vinorkis . " " My lord  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession to make  --  " Sleet opened his eyes and glared bleakly . Valentine signaled him to be calm . Vinorkis said , " My lord  --  " and faltered . He began again . " My lord , in Pidruid a man came to me and said , There is a tall lair/haired stranger at a certain inn and we believe he has committed monstrous crimes . ' And this man offered me a bag of crowns if I would keep close by the fair-haired stranger , and go wherever he went , and give news of his doings to the imperial proctors every few days . " " A spy ? " Sleet blurted . His hand flew to the dagger at his hip . " Who was this man who hired you ? " Valentine asked quietly . The Hjort shook his head . " Someone in the service of the Coronal , by the way he dressed . I never knew his name . " " And you gave these reports ? " Valentine said . " Yes , my lord , " Vinorkis murmured , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time I hardly believed that you could be the criminal they said you were , for you seemed kind and gentle and sweet of soul , but I had taken their money , and there was more money for me every time I reported  --  " " Let me kill him now , " Sleet muttered harshly . " There 'll be no killing , " Valentine said . " Neither now nor later . " " He 's dangerous , my lord ! " " Not any longer . " " I never trusted him , " Sleet said . " Nor did Carabella , nor Deliamber . It was n't just that he was Hjort . There was always something sh illy about him , sly , insinuating . All those questions , all that sucking around for information  --  " Vinorkis said , " I ask pardon . I had no idea whom I was betraying , my lord . " " You believe that ? " Sleet cried . " Yes , " Valentine said . " Why not ? He had no more idea who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to trail a fair-haired man and give information to the government . Is that so evil a thing ? He was Nerving his Coronal , or so he thought . His loyalty must not be repaid by your dagger , Sleet . " " My lord , sometimes you are too innocent , " Sleet said . " Perhaps true . But not this time . We have much to gain by forgivingthis man , and nothing at all by slaying him . " To the Hjort Valentinesaid , " You have my pardon , Vinorkis . I ask only that you be asloyal to the true Coronal as you 've been to the false . " You have my pledge , my lord . " " Good . Get yourself some sleep , now , and put away your fear . " Vinorkis made the starburst and backed away , settling down in mid-cabin beside two of the Skandars . Sleet said , " That was unwise , my lord . What if he continues tospy on us ? " In these jungles ' ? Messages to whom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think he can be trusted , " said Valentine . " I know , this confessionmay have been only a double ruse , to lull us into casting aside our suspicions . I 'm not as naive as you think , Sleet . I charge you to keep private watch over him when we reach civilization again just in case . But I think you 'll find his repentance is genuine . And I have uses for him that will make him valuable to me . " " Uses , my lord ? " " A spy can lead us to other spies . And there 'll be other spies , Sleet . We may want Vinorkis to maintain his contacts with the imperialagents , eh ? " Sleet winked . " I see your meaning , my lord ! " Valentine smiled , and they fell silent . Yes , he told himself , Vinorkis ' horror and remorse were genuine . And provided much that Valentine needed to know ; for if the Coronal had been willing to pay good sums to have an insignificant wanderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandereractually be ? Valentine felt a weird prickling along his skin . More than anything else , Vinorkis ' confession was a confirmation of all that Valentine had discovered about himself . Surely , if the techniquethat had been used to cast him from his body was new and relatively untried , the conspirators would be uncertain about how permanent the mind-wiping would be , and would hardly dare to allow the outcast Coronal to roam about the land free and unobserved . A spy , then , and probably others close by ; and the threat of quick preventiveaction if word got back to the usurper that Valentine was beginning to recover his memory . He wondered how carefully the imperial forces were tracking him , and at what point they would choose to intercept him on his journey toward Alhanroel . Onward the wagon moved in the blackness of night . Deliamber and Lisamon Hultin conferred endlessly with Zalzan Kavol about the route ; the other main Metamorph settlement , Avendroyne , lay somewhere to the southeast of Ilirivoyne , in a gap between two great mountains , and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . To ride blithely into another Metamorph town hardly seemed wise , of course . Word must have gone on ahead of the freeing of the prisoner and the escape of the wagon . Still , there was even greater peril in trying to go back toward Piurifayne Fountain . Valentine , not at all sleepy , re-enacted the Metamorph pantomime a hundred times in his mind . It had the quality of a dream , yes , but no dream was so immediate : he had been close enough to touch his Metamorph counterpart ; he had seen , beyond all doubt , those shiftsp191of features from fair to dark , dark to fair . The Metamorphs knew the truth , more clearly than he himself . Could they read souls , as Deliamber sometimes did ? What had they felt , knowing they had a fallen Coronal in their midst ? No awe , certainly : Coronals were nothing to them , mere symbols of their own defeat thousands of years ago . It must have seemed terribly funny to them to have a successor to Lord Stiamot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks and dances , far from the splendors of Castle Mount , a Coronal in their own muddy wooden village . How strange , he thought . How much like a dream . Toward dawn huge rounded mountains became visible , with a broad notch between them . Avendroyne could not be far . Zalzan Kavol , with a deference he had never shown before , came aft to consult Valentine on strategy . Lie low in the woods all day , and wait until nightfall to try to get past Avendroyne ? Or attempt a bold daylight passage ? Leadership was unfamiliar to Valentine . He pondered a moment , trying to look far-seeing and thoughtful . At length he said , " If we go forward by day , we are too conspicuous . On the other hand , if we waste all day hiding here , we give them more time to prepare plans against us . " " Tonight , " Sleet pointed out , " is the high festival again in Ilirivoyne , and probably here also . We might slip by them while they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I agree , " said Lisamon Hultin . Valentine looked around . " Carabella ? " " If we wait , we give the Ilirivoyne people time to overtake us . I may go onward . " " Deliamber ? " The Vroon delicately touched tentacle-tips together . " Onward . BypassAvendroyne , double back toward Verf . There 'll be a second road to the Fountain from Avendroyne , surely . " " Yes , " Valentine said . He looked to Zalzan Kavol . " My thoughts run with Deliamber and Carabella . What of yours ? " Zalzan Kavol scowled . " Mine say , let the wizard make this wagon fly , and take us tonight to Ni-moya . Otherwise , continue on without waiting . " " So be it , " said Valentine , as if he had made the decision single/handedly . " And when we approach Avendroyne , we cautiously as daybreak arrived . The rain was intermittent , but when it came now it was no gentle spatter , more an almost tropical downpour , a heavy cannonade of drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To Valentine the rain was welcome : perhaps it would keep the Metamorphs indoors as they went through . There were signs of outskirts now , scattered wicker huts . The road forked and forked again , Deliamber offering a guess at each point of division , until finally they knew they must be close to Avendroyne . Lisamon Hultin and Sleet rode out as scouts , and returned in an hour with good news : one of the two roads just ahead ran right into the heart of Avendroyne , where festival preparations were under way , and the other curved toward the northeast , bypassing the city entirely and going through what looked like a farming district on the farther slopes of the mountains . They took the northeast road . Uneventfully they passed the Avendroyneregion . Now , in late afternoon , they journeyed down the mountain pass and into a broad , thickly forested plain , rainswept and dark , that marked the eastern perimeter of Metamorph territory . Zalzan Kavol drove the wagon furiously onward , pausing only when Shanamir insisted that the mounts absolutely had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of synthetic origin , but living things were what they were , and now and then they needed to halt . The Skandar yielded reluctantly ; he seemed possessed by desperate need to put Piurifayne far behind him . Toward twilight , as they went in heavy rain through rough , irregularcountry , trouble came suddenly upon them . Valentine was riding in mid-cabin , with Deliamber and Carabella ; most of the others were sleeping , and Heitrag Kavol and Gibor Haern were driving . There came a crashing , crackling , smashing sound from ahead , and a moment later the wagon jolted to a stop . " Tree down in the storm ! " Heitrag Kavol called . " Road blocked in front of us ! " Zalzan Kavol muttered curses and tugged Lisamon Hultin awake . Valentine saw nothing but green ahead , the entire crown of some forest giant blocking the road . It might take hours or even days to clear that . The Skandars , hoisting energy-throwers to their shoulders , went out to investigate . Valentine followed . Darkness was falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain swept almost horizontally into their faces . " Let 's get to work , " Zalzan Kavol growled , shaking his head in annoyance . " Thelkar ! You start cutting from down there ! Rovorn ! The big side branches ! Erfon  --  " " It might be swifter , " Valentine suggested , " to back up and look for another fork in the road . " The idea startled Zalzan Kavol , as if the Skandar would never in a century have conceived such a notion . He mulled it for a moment . " Yes , " he said finally . " That does make some sense . If we  --  " And a second tree , larger even than the first , toppled to the ground a hundred yards behind them . The wagon was trapped . Valentine was the first to comprehend what must be happening . " Into the wagon , everyone ! It 's an ambush ! " He rushed toward the open door . Too late . Out of the darkening forest came a stream of Metamorphs , fifteen or twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their midst . Zalzan Kavol let out a terrible cry of rage and opened fire with his energy-thrower ; the blaze of light cast a strange lavender glow over the roadside and two Metamorphs fell , charred hideously . But in the same instant Heitrag Kavol uttered a strangled gurgle and dropped , a weapon shaft through his neck , and Thelkar fell , clutchingat another in his chest . Suddenly the rear end of the wagon was ablaze . Those within came scrambling out , Lisamon Hultin leading the way with her vibration-swordhigh . Valentine found himself attacked by a Metamorph wearing his own face ; he kicked the creature away , pivoted , slashed a second one with the knife that was his only weapon . That wasstrange , to inflict a wound . In weird fascination , he watched the bronzehuedfluid begin to flow . The Valentine Metamorph came at him again . Claws went for his eyes . Valentine dodged , twisted , stabbed . The blade sank deep and t he Metamorph reeled back , clutching at its chest . Valentine trembled in shock , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . This was a new experience for him , this fighting and killing , and it made his soul ache . But to be gentle now was to invite a quick death . He thrust and cut , thrust and cut . From behind him he heard Carabella call , " How are you doing ? " " Holding  --  my-own  --  " he grunted . Zalzan Kavol , seeing his magnificent wagon on fire , howled and caught a Metamorph by the waist and hurled it into the pyre ; twop194more rushed at him , but another Skandar seized them and snapped them like sticks with each pair of hands . In the frantic melee Valentine caught sight of Carabella wrestling with a Metamorph , forcing it to the ground with the powerful forearm muscles years of juggling had developed ; and there was Sleet , ferociously vindictive , pounding anotherwith his boots in savage joy . But the wagon was burning . The wagon was burning . The woods were full of Metamorphs , night was swiftly coming on , the rain was a torrent , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased , the center of the battle shifted from the roadside to the forest , and matters became even more confused , for in the darkness it was hard to tell friend from foe . The Metamorph trick of shapeshifting added another complication , although in the frenzy of the fight they were unable to hold their transformationsfor long , and what seemed to be Sleet , or Shanamir , or Zalzan Kavol , reverted quickly to its native form . Valentine fought savagely . He was slippery with his own sweat and the blood of Metamorphs , and his heart hammered mightily with the furious exertion . Panting , gasping , never still an instant , he waded through the tangle of enemies with a zeal that astonished him , never pausing for an instant 's rest . Thrust and cut , thrust and cutThe Metamorphs were armed with only the simplest of weapons , and , though there seemed to be dozens of them , their numbers soon were dwindling rapidly . Lisamon Hultin was doing awful destruction with her vibration-sword , swinging it two-handed and lopping off the boughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surviving Skandars , spraying energy-bolts wildly around the scene , had ignited half a dozen trees and had littered the ground with fallen Metamorphs . Sleet was maiming and slaughtering as if he could in one wild minute avenge himself for all the pain he fancied the Metamorphs had brought upon him . Khun and Vinorkis too were fighting with passionate energy . As suddenly as the ambush had begun , it was over . By the light of the fires Valentine could see dead Metamorphs everywhere . Two dead Skandars lay among them . Lisamon Hultin bore a bloody but shallow wound on one thigh ; Sleet had lost half his jerkin and had taken several minor cuts ; Shanamir had clawmarks across his cheek . Valentine too felt some trifling scratches and nicks , and his arms had a leaden ache of fatigue . But he had not been seriouslyharmed . Deliamber , though  --  where was Deliamber ? The Vroon wizard was nowhere to be seen . In anguish Valentine turned to Carabellaand said , " Did the Vroon stay in the wagon ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p195Valentine  frowned . In the silence of the forest the only sounds were the terrible hissing and crackling of fire and the quiet mocking patter of the rain . " Deliamber ? " Valentine called . " Deliamber , where are you ? " " Here , " answered a high-pitched voice from above . Valentine looked up and saw the sorcerer clinging to a sturdy bough , fifteen feet off the ground . " Warfare is not one of my skills , " Deliamber explainedblandly , swinging outward and letting himself drop into LisamonHultin 's arms . Carabella said , " What do we do now ? " Valentine realized that she was asking him . He was in command . Zalzan Kavol , kneeling by his brothers ' bodies , seemed stunned by their deaths and by the loss of his precious wagon . He said , " We have no choice but to cut through the forest . If we try to take the main road we 'll meet more Metamorphs . Shanamir , what of the mounts ? " " Dead , " the boy sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On foot , then . A long wet journey it will be , too . Deliamber , how far do you think we are from the River Steiche ? " " A few days ' journey , I suspect . But we have no sure notion of the direction . " " Follow the slope of the land , " Sleet said . " Rivers wo n't lie uphill from here . If we keep going east we 're bound to hit it . " " Unless a mountain stands in our way , " Deliamber remarked . " We 'll find the river , " Valentine said firmly . " The Steiche flows into the Zimr at Ni-moya , is that right ? " " Yes , " said Deliamber , " but its flow is turbulent . " " We 'll have to chance it . A raft , I suppose , will be quickest tobuild . Come . If we stay here much longer we 'll be set upon again . " They could salvage nothing from the wagon , neither clothing nor food nor belongings nor their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had been on them when they came forth to meet the ambushers . To Valentine that was no great loss ; but to some of the others , particularly the Skandars , it was overwhelming . The wagon had been their home a long while . It was difficult to get Zalzan Kavol to move from the spot . He seemed frozen , unable to abandon the bodies of his brothers and the ruin of his wagon . Gently Valentine urged him to his feet . Some of the Metamorphs , he said , might well have escaped in the skirmish ; they could soon return with reinforcements ; it was perilous to remain here . Quickly they dug shallow graves in the soft forest floor and laid Thelkar and Ileit.rag Kavol to rest . Then , in steady rain andp196gathering darkness , they set out in what they hoped was an easterly direction . For over an hour they walked , until it became too dark to see ; then they camped miserably in a little soggy huddle , clinging to one another until dawn . At first light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way onward through the tangled forest . The rain , at least , had stopped . The forest here was less of a jungle , and gave them little challenge , except for an occasional swift stream that had to be forded with care . At one of those , Carabella lost her footing and was fished out by Lisamon Hultin ; at another it was Shanamir who was swept downstream , and Khun who plucked him to safety . They walked until midday , and rested an hour or two , making a scrappy meal of raw roots and berries . Then they went on until darkness . And passed two more days in the same fashion . And on the third came to a grove of dwikka-trees , eight fat squat giants in the forest , with monstrous swollen fruits hanging from them . " Food ! " Zalzan Kavol bellowed . " Food sacred to the forest-brethren , " Lisamon Hultin said . " Be careful ! " The famished Skandar , nevertheless , was on the verge of cutting down one of the enormous fruits with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " Zalzan Kavol stared incredulously . For an instant his old habits of command asserted themselves , and he glared at Valentine as if about to strike him . But he kept his temper in check . " Look , " Valentine said . Forest-brethren were emerging from behind every tree . They were armed with their dart-blowers ; and seeing the slender apelike creaturesencircling them , Valentine in his weariness felt almost willing to be slain . But only for a moment . He recovered his spirits and said to Lisamon Hultin , " Ask them if we may have food and guides to the Steiche . If they ask a price , we can juggle for them with stones , or pieces of fruit , I suppose . " The warrior-woman , twice as tall as the forest-brethren , went into their midst and talked with them a long time . She was smiling when she returned . " They are aware , " she said , " that we are the ones who freed their brothers in Ilirivoyne ! " " Then we are saved ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest , " Valentine said . Lisamon Hultin went on , " We are their guests . They will feed us . They will guide us. "  |p197That  night the wanderers ate richly on dwikka-fruit and other forest delicacies , and there was actually laughter among them for the first time since the ambush . Afterward the forest-brethren performeda sort of dance for them , a monkeyish prancing thing , and Sleet and Carabella and Valentine responded with impromptu juggling using objects collected in the forest . Afterward Valentine slept a deep , satisfying sleep . In his dreams he had the gift of flight , and saw himself soaring to the summit of Castle Mount . And in the morning a party of chattering forest-brethren led them to the River Steiche , three hours ' journey from the dwikka-tree grove , and bade them farewell with little twittering cries . The river was a sobering sight . It was broad , though nothing remotelylike the mighty Zimr , and it sped northward with startling haste , flowing so energetically that it had carved out a deep bed borderedin many places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snags rose above the water , and downstream Valentine could see white eddies of rapids . The building of rafts took a day and a half . They cut down the young slim trees that grew by the riverbank , trimmed and trued them with knives and sharp stones , lashed them together with vines . The results were hardly elegant , but the rafts , though crude , did look reasonablyriverworthy . There were three altogether  --  one for the four Skandars , one for Khun , Vinorkis , Lisamon Hultin , and Sleet , and one occupied by Valentine , Carabella , Shanamir , and Deliamber . " We will probably become separated as we go downriver , " Sleet said . " We should choose a meeting-place in Ni-moya . " Deliamber said , " The Steiche and the Zimr flow together at a place called Nissimorn . There is a broad , sandy beach there . Let us meet at Nissimorn Beach . " " At Nissimorn Beach , yes , " Valentine said . He cut loose the cord that bound his raft to the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first day 's journey was uneventful . There were rapids , but not difficult ones , and they poled safely past them . Carabella showed skill at handling the raft , and deftly steered them around the occasionalrocky patches . After a time the rafts became separated , Valentine 's taking some sub . urrent and moving rapidly ahead of the other two . In the morning he waited , hoping the others would catch up . But there was no sign of t hem and eventually he decided to depart . On , on , on , for the most part swept easily along , with occasional moments of anxiety in the white-water stretches . By afternoon of thep198second day the course was becoming rougher . The land seemed to dip here , sloping downward as the Zimr drew near , and the river , following the line of descent , plunged and bucked . Valentine began to worry about waterfalls ahead . They had no charts , no notion of dangers : they took everything as it came . He could only trust to luck that this swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? By boat to Piliplok , and by pilgrim-ship to the Isle of Sleep , and somehow procure an interview with the Lady his mother , and then ? And then ? How did one claim the Coronal 's throne , when one 's face was not the face of Lord Valentine the rightful ruler ? By what claim , by what authority ? It seemed to Valentine an impossible quest . He might be better remaining here in the forest , ruling over his little band . They , readily enough , accepted him for what he thought himself to be ; but in that world of billions of strangers , in that vast empire of giant cities that lay beyond the edge of the horizon , how , how , how would he ever manage to convince the unbelievers that he , Valentine the juggler , wasNo . These thoughts were foolish . He had never , not since he had appeared , shorn of memory and past , on the verge overlooking Pidruid , felt the need to rule over others ; and if he had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift and by Zalzan Kavol 's default than out of any overt desire on his part . And yet he was in command , however tentatively and delicately . So it would be as he traveled onward through Majipoor . He would take one step at a time , and do that which seemed right and proper , and perhaps the Lady would guide him , and if the Divine so willed it he would one day stand again on Castle Mount , and if that was not part of the great plan , why , that would be acceptable also . There was nothing to fear . The future would unroll serenely in its own true course , as it had done since Pidruid . And " Valentine ! " Carabella shouted . The river seemed to sprout giant stony teeth . There were boulders everywhere , and monstrous white whirlpools , and , just ahead , an ominoustumbling descent , a place where the Steiche leaped out into space and went roaring down a series of steps to a valley far below . Valentine gripped his pole , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two snags and was ripped from his grasp ; a moment later there was a ghastly grinding sound as the flimsy raft , battered by submerged rocks , swung around at right angles to its course and split apart . He was hurled into the chilly stream and swept forward like a cork . For a moment he grasped Carabella by the wrist ; but then the currentp199pulled her free , and as he clutched desperately for her he was engulfed by the swift water and driven under . Gasping and choking , Valentine struggled to get his head above water . When he did , he was already far downstream . The wreckage of the raft was nowhere in sight . " Carabella ? " he yelled . " Shanamir ? Deliamber ? Hoy ! Hoy ! " He roared until his voice was ragged , but the booming of the rapids so thoroughly covered his cries that he could scarcely hear them himself . A terrible sense of pain and loss numbed his spirit . All gone , then ? His friends , his beloved Carabella , the wily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all swept to death in an instant ? No . No . Unthinkable . That was an agony far worse than this business , still unreal to him , of being a Coronal thrust from the Castle . What did that mean ? These were beings of flesh and blood , dear to him ; that was only a title and power . He would not stop calling their names as the river threw him about . " Carabella ! " he shouted . " Shanamir ! " Valentine clawed at rocks , trying to halt his willy-nilly descent , hut he was in the heart of the rapids now , buffeted and battered by the current and by the stones of the riverbed . Dazed and exhausted , half paralyzed by grief , Valentine gave up struggling and let himself be carried along , down the giant staircase of the river , a tiny plaything spinning and bouncing along . He drew his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms over his head , attempting to minimize the surface he presented to the rocks . The power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , the grand adventure of Valentine of Majipoor , once Coronal , later wandering juggler , now about to be broken to bits by the impersonal and uncaring forces of nature . He commended himself to the Lady whom he thought to be his mother , and gulped air , and went heels over head , head over heels , down and down and down , and struck something with frightening force and thought this must be the end , only it was not the end , and struck something again that gave him an agonizing blow in the ribs , knocking the air from him , and he must have lost consciousness for a time , for he felt no further pain . And then he found himself lying on a pebble-strewn strand , in a quiet sidestream of the river . It seemed to him that he had beenshaken in a giant dice-box for hours , and cast up at random , discarded and useless . His body ached in a thousand places . His lungs felt soggy when he breathed . He was shivering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , under a vast cloudless sky , at theedge of some unknown wilderness , with civilization some unknownp200distance ahead and his friends perhaps dashed to death on the boulders . But he was alive . That much was sure . Alone , battered , helpless , grief-stricken , lost . . . but alive . The adventure , then , was not ended . Slowly , with infinite effort , Valentine hauled himself out of the surf and tottered to the riverbank , and let himself carefully down on a wide flat rock , and with numb fingers undid his clothing and stretched out to dry himself under the warm friendly sun . He looked toward the river , hoping to see Carabella come swimming along , or Shanamir with the wizard perched on his shoulder . No one . But that does n't mean they 're dead , he told himself . They may have been cast up on farther shores . I 'll rest here for a time , Valentine resolved , and then I 'll go searching for the others , and then , with them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward Piliplok , toward the Isle of the Lady , onward , onward , onward toward Castle Mount or whatever else lies ahead for me . Onward . Onward . Onward.  |p203For  what felt like months or perhaps years Valentine lay sprawled larked on his warm flat rock on the pebbly beach where the unruly River Steiche had deposited him . The roar of the river was a constant drone in his ears , oddly soothing . The sunlight enfolded him in a hazy golden nimbus , and he told himself that its touch would heal his bruises and abrasions and contusions , if only he lay still long enough . Vaguely he knew he ought to rise and see about shelter , and begin to search for his companions , but he barely could find the et r'ength to turn from one side to the other . This was no way , he knew , for a Coronal of Majipoor to conduct himself . Such self-indulgence might be acceptable for merchants or tavernkeepers or even jugglers , but a higher discipline rested upon one who had pretensions to govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and clothe your body , and start walking northward along the riverbank until you reach those who can help you regain your lolly place . Yes . Up , Valentine ! But he remained where he was . He had expended every scrap of energy in him , Coronal or not , during the helter-skelter plunge down the rapids . Lying here like this , he had a powerful sense of the immensity of Majipoor , its many thousands of miles of circumference stretching out beneath his limbs , a planet large enough comfortably to house twenty billion people without crowding , a planet of enormous cities and wondrous parks and forest preserves and sacred districts and agricultural territories , and it seemed to him that if he took the trouble to rise it would be necessary for him to cover all that colossal domain on foot , step by step by step . It seemed simpler to stay where he was . Something tickled the small of his back , something rubbery and Insistent . tie ignored it . " Valentine ' ? " He ignored that too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it had filtered through his fatigue-dulled brain that someone had spoken his name , and therefore that one of his companions must have survived after all . Joy flooded his soul . With what little energy he could muster , Valentine raised his head and saw the small many-limbed figure of Autifon Deliamber standing beside him . The Vroonish wizard was about to prod him a third time . " You 're alive ! " Valentine cried . " Evidently I am . And so are you , more or less . " " And Carabella ? Shanamir ? " " I have not seen them . " " As I feared , " Valentine murmured dully . He closed his eyes andlowered his head , and in leaden despair lay once more like jetsam . " Come , " Deliamber said . " There is a vast journey ahead of us . " " I know . That 's why I do n't want to get up . " " Are you hurt ? " " I do n't think so . But I want to rest , Deliamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sorcerer 's tentacles probed and poked Valentine in a dozen places . " No serious damage , " the Vroon murmured . " Much of you is still healthy . " " Much of me is n't , " said Valentine indistinctly . " What about you ? " " Vroons are good swimmers , even old ones like me . I am unhurt . We should go on , Valentine . " " Later . " " Is this how a Coronal of Majip  --  " " No , " Valentine said . " But a Coronal of Majipoor would not have had to shoot the Steiche rapids on a slapped-together log raft . A Coronal would not have been wandering in this wilderness for days and days , sleeping in the rain and eating nothing but nuts and berries . A Coronal  --  " " A Coronal would not allow his lieutenants to see him in a condition of indolence and spiritlessness , " Deliamber said sharply . " And one of them is approaching right now . " Valentine blinked and sat up . Lisamon Hultin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle disarranged , her clothing in shreds , her gigantic fleshy body purpled with bruises here and there , but her pace was jaunty and her voice , when she called out to them , was as booming as ever . " Hoy ! Are you intact ? " " I think so , " Valentine answered . " Have you seen any others ? " " Carabella and the boy , half a mile or so back that way . "  |p205He  felt his spirits soar . " Are they all right ? " " She is , at any rate . " " And Shanamir ? " " Does n't want to wake up . She sent me out to look for the sorcerer . Found him sooner than I thought . Phaugh , what a river ! That raft came apart so fast it was almost funny ! " Valentine reached for his clothing , found it still wet , and , with a shrug , dropped it to the rocks . " We must get to Shanamir at once . Have you news of Khun and Sleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went into the river and when I came up I was alone . " " And the Skandars ? " " No sign of them at all . " To Deliamber she said , " Where do you think we are , wizard ? " " Far from anywhere , " the Vroon replied . " Safely out of the Metamorph lands , at any rate . Come , take me to the boy . " Lisamon Hultin scooped Deliamber to her shoulder and strode back along the beach , while Valentine limped along behind them , carrying his damp clothing over his arm . After a time they came upon Carabella and Shanamir camped in an inlet of bright white sand surrounded by thick river-reeds with scarlet stems . Carabella , battered and weary-looking , wore only a brief leather skirt . But she seemed in reasonably good shape . Shanamir lay unconscious , breathing slowly , his skin an odd dark hue . " Oh , Valentine ! " Carabella cried , springing up and running to him . " I saw you swept away  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see you again ! " He held her close against him . " And I thought the same . I thought you were lost to me forever , love . " " Were you hurt ? " " Not permanently , " he said . " And you ? " " I was tossed and tossed and tossed until I could n't remember my own name . But then I found a calm place and I swam to shore , and Shanamir was already there . But he would n't wake up . And Lisamon came out of the underbrush and said she 'd try to find Deliaamber , and  --  Will he be all right , wizard ? " " In a moment , " said Deliamber , arranging his tentacle-tips over the boy 's chest and forehead , as if making some transfer of energy . $hunamir grunted and stirred . His eyes opened tentatively , closed , opened again . In a thick voice he began to say something , but Deliarber told him to be silent , to lie still , to let the strength flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move on that afternoon.  |p206Valentine  and Carabella constructed a crude shelter out of reeds ; Lisamon Hultin assembled a meager dinner of raw fruit and young pininna-sprouts ; and they sat in silence beside the river , watching a spectacular sunset , bands of violet and gold streaking the great dome of the sky , reflections in luminous tones of orange and purple in the water , undertones of pale green , satiny red , silken crimson , and then the first puffs of gray and black , the swift descent of night . In the morning they all felt able to proceed , though stiff from a night in the open . Shanamir showed no ill effects : Deliamber 's care and the natural resilience of youth had restored his vitality . Patching together their clothing as best they could , they set out to the north , following the beach until it gave out , then continuing through the forest of gawky androdragma-trees and flowering alabandina that flanked the river . The air was soft and mild here , and the sun , descending in dappled splotches through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stragglers . In the third hour of the march Valentine caught the scent of ' fire just ahead , and what smelled very much like the aroma of grilled fish . He jogged forward , salivating , prepared to buy , beg , if necessary steal , some of that fish , for it had been more days than he cared to count since he had last tasted cooked food . Down a rough talus slope he skidded , into sunlight on white pebbles , so bright he could barely see . In the glare he made out three figures crouched over a fire by the river 's edge , and when he shaded his eyes he discovered that one was a compact human with pale skin and a startling shock of white hair , and another was a long-legged blue-skinned being of alien birth , and the third a Hjort . " Sleet ! " Valentine cried . " Khun ! Vinorkis ! " He ran toward them , slipping and sliding over the rocks . They watched his wild approach calmly , and when he was close by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake on which was spitted a fillet of some pink-fleshed river fish . " Have some lunch , " Sleet said amiably . Valentine gaped . " How did you get so far ahead of us ? What , did you build this fire with ? How did you catch the fish ? What have you  --  " " Your fish will get cold , " Khun said . " Eat first , questions after . " Valentine took a hasty bite  --  he had never tasted anything sodelicious , a tender moist meat splendidly seared , surely as elegant amorsel as had ever been served in the feasts on Castle Mount  --  and , turning , called to his companions to come down the slope . But theywere already on their way , Shanamir whooping and cavorting as hep207ran , Carabella gracefully darting over the rocks , Lisamon Hultin , bearing Deliamber , pounding thunderously toward him . " There 's fish for all ! " Sleet proclaimed . They had caught at least a dozen , which circled sadly in a shallow rock-rimmed pool near the fire . Efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleet held them briefly over the flame and passed them to the others , who ate ravenously . Sleet explained that when their raft had broken up they had found themselves clinging to a fragment some three logs wide , and had managed to hang on all the way through the rapids and far downstream . They vaguely remembered having seen the beach where Valentine was cast ashore , but they had not noticed him on it as they passed by , and they had drifted another few miles before they had recovered enough from their rapids-running to want to let go of their logs and swim to the bank . Khun had caught the fish bare-handed : he had , said Sleet , the quickest hands he had ever seen , and would probably make a magnificent juggler . Khun grinned  --  the first time Valentine had seen anything but a grim expression on his face . " And the fire ? " Carabella asked . " You started it by snapping your fingers , I suppose ? " " We attempted it , " Sleet answered smoothly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked over to the village of fisherfolk just beyond the bend and asked to borrow a light . " " Fisherfolk ? " Valentine said , startled . " An outpost of Liimen , " said Sleet , " who evidently do n't know that it 's their racial destiny to sell sausages in the western cities . They gave us shelter last night , and have agreed to ferry us up to N i-moya this afternoon , so that we can wait for our friends at Nissimorn Beach . " He smiled . " I suppose we 'll need to hire a second boat now . " Deliamber said , " Are we that close to Ni-moya ? " " Two hours by boat , so I 'm told , to the place where the rivers flow together . " Suddenly the world seemed less huge to Valentine , and the chores that awaited him less overwhelming . To have eaten a real meal once again , and to know that a friendly settlement lay nearby , and that he would soon be leaving the wilderness behind , was tremendously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of Zalzan Kavoland his three surviving brothers . The I , iiman village was indeed close at hand  --  perhaps five hundred souls , short flat-headed dark-skinned people whose triple sets of bright fiery eyes regarded the wanderers with little curiosity . Theyp208lived in modest thatched huts close beside the river , and raised an assortment of crops in small gardens to supplement the catch that their fleet of crude fishing-boats brought in . Their dialect was a difficult one , but Sleet seemed able to communicate with them and managed to arrange not only another boat but also the purchase , for a couple of crowns , of fresh clothing for Carabella and Lisamon Hultin . In early afternoon they set out , with four taciturn Liimen as their crew , on the journey to Ni-moya . The river ran as swift as ever here , but there were few rapids of any consequence , and the two boats sped nicely along through countryside increasingly populous and tame . The steep riverbanks of the uplands gave way , down here , to broad alluvial plains of heavy black silt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared . Now the river widened and grew calm , becoming a broad , even waterway with a deep blue glint . The land here was flat and open , and though the settlements on both sides were doubtless goodly cities with populations of many thousands , they seemed mere hamlets , so dwarfed were they by the gigantic surroundings . Ahead lay a dark , immense headwater that seemed to span the entire horizon as though it were the open sea . " River Zimr , " announced the Liiman at the helm of Valentine 's boat . " Steiche ends here . Nissimorn Beach on left . " Valentine beheld a huge crescent strand , bordered by a dense grove of palm trees of a peculiarly lopsided shape , purplish fronds jutting up like ruffled feathers . As they drew near , Valentine was startled to see a raft of crudely trimmed logs on the beach , and , sitting beside it , four giant shaggy four-armed figures . The Skandars were waiting for them . Zalzan Kavol saw nothing extraordinary about his voyage . His raft had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way through , getting jounced about a little , but not seriously ; they had continued on downstream to Nissimorn Beach , where they had camped in growing impatience , wondering what was delaying the rest of the party . It had not occurred to the Skandar that the other rafts might have been wrecked in the passage , nor had he seen any of the castaways along the riverbank en route . " Did you have trouble ? " he asked in what seemed to be genuine innocence.  | " Of a minor sort , " Valentine replied dryly . " But we seem to be reunited , and it will be good to sleep in proper lodgings again tonight . " They resumed the journey , and presently they passed into the great confluence of the Steiche and the Zimr , a water so wide that it was impossible for Valentine to conceive it as the mere meetingplaceof two rivers . At the town of Nissimorn on the southwestern shore they parted from the Liimen and boarded the ferry that would take them on across to Ni-moya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty million citizens dwelled here . At Ni-moya the River Zimr made a great bend , changing its course sharply from easterly to southeasterly . There a prodigious megalopolis had taken form . It spread for hundreds of miles along both banks of the river and up several tributaries that flowed in from the north . Valentine and his companionssaw first the southern suburbs , residential districts that gave way , in the extreme south , to the agricultural territory stretching down into the Steiche Valley . The main urban zone lay on the north bank , and could only dimly be seen at first , tier upon tier of flattoppedwhite towers descending toward the river . Ferries by the dozens plied the water here , linking the myriad riverside towns . The crossing took several hours , and twilight was beginning before Ni-moya proper was clearly in view . The city looked magical . Its lights , just coming on , sparkled invitinglyagainst the backdrop of heavily forested green hills and impeccablewhite buildings . Giant fingers of piers thrust into the river , and an astounding bustle of vessels great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed so mighty to Valentine in his early days of wandering , was a minor city indeed compared with this . Only the Skandars , Khun , and Deliamber had seen Ni-moya before . Deliambr spoke of the city 's marvels : its Gossamer Galleria , a mercantile arcade a mile long , raised above the ground on nearly invisible cables ; its Park of Fabulous Beasts , where the rarest of Majipoor'sfauna , those creatures brought closest to extinction by the Npread of civilization , roved in surroundings approximating their naturillhabitats ; its Crystal Boulevard , a glittering street of revolving reflectors that awed the eye ; its Grand Bazaar , fifteen square miles of mazelike passageways housing uncountable thousands of tiny shops under continuous roofs of dazzling yellow sparklecloth ; its Museum of Worlds , its Chamber of Sorcery , its Ducal Palace , built on a heroic scale said to be surpassed only by Lord Valentine 's Castle , and many of her things that sounded , to Valentine , more like the stuff of myth and fiintasy than anything one might . encounter in a real city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thousiuul-instrument munici/pal orchestra , the floating restaurants , the artificial birds with jeweled eyes , and all the rest would have to wait until , if ever the day came , he returned to Ni-moya in a Coronal 's robes . As the ferry neared the slip Valentine called everyone together and said , " Now we must determine our individual courses . I mean to take passage here for Piliplok , and make my way from there to the Isle . I 've prized your companionship this far , and I would have it even longer , but I can offer you nothing except endless journeying and the possibility of an early death . My hope of success is slight and the obstacles are formidable . Will any of you continue with me ? " " To the other side of the world ! " Shanamir cried . " And I , " said Sleet , and Vinorkis the same . " Would you have doubted me ? " Carabella asked . Valentine smiled . He looked to Deliamber , who said , " The sanctity of the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightful Coronal wherever he asks ? " " This mystifies me , " Lisamon Hultin said . " I understand none of this business of a Coronal roaming out of his proper body . But I have no other employment , Valentine . I am with you . " " I thank you all , " Valentine said . " I will thank you again , and more grandly , in the feasting-hall on Castle Mount . " Zalzan Kavol said , " And have you no use for Skandars , my lord ? " Valentine had not expected that . " Will you come ? " " Our wagon is lost . Our brotherhood is broken by death . We are without our juggling gear . I feel no calling to be a pilgrim , but I will follow you to the Isle and beyond , and so also will my brothers , if you want us . " " I want you , Zalzan Kavol . Is there such a post as juggler to the royal court ? You will have it , I promise ! " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is one more volunteer , " said Khun . " You too ? " Valentine said in surprise . The dour alien replied , " It matters little to me who is king of this planet where I am stranded . But it matters much to me to behave honorably . I would be dead now in Piurifaynel but for you . I owe you my life and I will give you such aid as I can . " Valentine shook his head . " We did for you only what any civilized being would do for any other . No debt exists . " " I see it otherwise . Besides , " said Khun , " my life until now has been trivial and shallow . I left my native Kianimot for no good reason to come here , and I lived foolishly here and nearly paid with myp211life , and why go on as I have been going ? I will join your cause and make it mine , and perhaps I will come to believe in it , or feel that I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only even the debt between us . With a death well accomplished I can repay the universe for a life poorly spent . Can you use me ? " " With all my heart I welcome you , " Valentine said . The ferry released a grand blast of its horn and glided smoothly into its slip . They stayed the night at the cheapest waterfront hotel they could find , a clean but stark place of whitewashed stone walls and communal tubs , and treated themselves to a modestly lavish dinner at an inn nearby . Valentine called for a pooling of funds and appointed Shanamirand Zalzan Kavol joint treasurers , since they seemed to have the finest appreciation of the value and uses of money . Valentine himself had much remaining of the funds he had had in Pidruid , and Zalzan Kavol produced from a hidden pouch a surprising stack of ten-royal pieces . Together they had enough to get them all to the Isle of Sleep . In the morning they bought passage aboard a riverboat similar to the one that had carried them from Khyntor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great port at the mouth of the Zimr . For all they had traveled across the face of Zimroel , some thousands of miles still separated them from the east coast . But on the broad breast of the Zimr vessels moved swiftly and serenely . Of course , the riverboat stopped again and again at the innumerable towns and cities of the river , Larnimisculus and Belka and Clarischanz , Flegit , Hiskuret , Centriun , Obliorn Vale , Salvamot , Gourkaine , Semirod and Cerinor and Haunfort Major , Impemond , Orgeliuse , Dambemuir , and many more , an unending flow of nearly indistinguishable places , each with its piers , ' its waterfront promenades , its planting of palms and alabandinas , its gaily painted warehouses and sprawling bazaars , its ticket-clutching passengers eager to come on board and impatient for departure once they had ascended the ramp . Sleet whittled juggling clubs out of some scraps of wood he begged from the crew , and Carabellafound balls somewhere to juggle , and at meals the Skandars quietly palmed dishware and slipped it out of sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the third day on they earned some extra crowns by performing on the plazadeck . Zalzan Kavol gradually regained some of his old gruff self-assurancenow that he was performing again , although he still was oddly pubdued , his soul moving on tiptoe through situations that once would have called forth angry storms.  |p212This  was the native territory of the four Skandars , who had been born in Piliplok and began their careers on circuit through the inland towns of the huge province , ranging as far upriver as Stenwamp and Port Saikforge , a thousand miles from the coast . This familiar countrysidebrightened them , these rolling tawny hills and bustling little cities of wooden buildings , and Zalzan Kavol spoke lengthily of his early career here , his successes and failures  --  very few of those  --  and of a dispute with an impresario that led him to seek fortune at the other end of Zimroel . Valentine suspected that there was some violence involved , perhaps some embroilment with the law , but he asked no questions . One night after much wine the Skandars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine 's time with them  --  a Skandar song , mournful and lugubrious , sung in a minor key as the singers shuffled about and about in a slump-shouldered circling march : Dark my heart Dark my fearsDim my eyes And full of tears . Death and woe , Death and woe , Follow usWhere'er we go . Far the landsI used to roam . Far the hillsAnd streams of home . Death and woe , Death and woe , Follow usWhere'er we go . Seas of dragons , Lands of pain , I shall not see My home again . Death and woe , Death and woe , Follow usWhere'er we go.  |p213The  song was so unrelievedly gloomy , and the enormous Skandars looked so absurd as they lurched about chanting it , that it was all that Valentine and Carabella could do to hold back laughter at first . But by the second chorus Valentine actually found himself moved by it , for there seemed real emotion in the song : the Skandars had met death and woe , and though they were close to home now , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , Valentine thought , it was a harsh and painful thing to be a Skandar on Majipoor , a shaggy-pelted creature moving ponderously in the warm air among smaller and sleeker beings . The summer now was over , and in eastern Zimroel it was the dry season , when warm winds blew from the south , vegetation went dormant until the spring rains , and , so said Zalzan Kavol , tempers became short and crimes of passion common . Valentine found this region less interesting than the jungles of the mid-continent or the subtropic floribundance of the far west , though he decided after a few days of close observation that it did have a certain austere beauty of its own , restrained and severe , quite unlike the riotous lushness of the west . All the same , he was pleased and relieved when , after day upon day on this changeless and seemingly unending river , Zalzan Kavol announced that the outskirts of Piliplok were in view . Piliplok was about as old and about as large as its counterpart port on the farther shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper . For Pidruid had been built without a plan , a random tangle of streets and avenues and boulevards winding around one another according to whim , whereas Piliplok had been laid out , untold thousands of years ago , with rigid , almost maniacal , precision . It occupied a promontory of great magnitude on the southern shore of the mouth of the Zimr . The river here was of inconceivable width , sixty or seventy miles across at the point where it flowed into the Inner Sea , and carrying the burden of silt and debris accumulated in all its swift seven-thousand-mile flow out of the far northwest , it stained the blue-green waters of the ocean with a dark tinge that , it was said , could be seen hundreds of miles out . The north headland at the rivermouth was a chalk cliff a mile high and many miles wide , which even from Piliplok was visible on a clear day , a shining white wall dazzling in the morning light . There was nothing over there thatp214could in any way be used as a harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was set aside as a holy preserve . Devotees of the Lady lived there in a withdrawal from the world so total that no one had intruded on them in a hundred years . But Piliplok was another matter : eleven million people occupying a city that radiated in stern spokes from its magnificent natural harbor . A series of curving bands crossed the axis of these spokes , the inner ones mercantile , then zones of industry and recreation , and in the outer reaches the residential neighborhoods , fairly sharply delimited by levels of wealth and to a lesser degree by race . There was a heavy concentration of Skandars in Piliplokitseemed to Valentine that every third person on the waterfront belonged to Zalzan Kavol 's people  --  and it was a little intimidating to see so many giant hairy four-armers swaggering about . Here , too , lived many of the aloof and aristocratic two-headed Su-Suheris folk , dealers in luxury commodities , fine fabrics and jewelry and the rarest handicrafts of every province . The air here was crisp and dry , and , feeling the unyielding southerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Zalzan Kavol had meant about the short tempers kindled by that wind . " Does it ever stop blowing ? " he asked . " On the first day of spring , " said Zalzan Kavol . Valentine hoped to be elsewhere by then . But a problem immediatelyappeared . With Zalzan Kavol and Deliamber he went to ShkuniborPier at the eastern end of Piliplok harbor to arrange transport to the Isle . For months now Valentine had imagined himself in this city and at that pier , and it had taken on an almost legendary glamour in his mind , a place of vast perspectives and sweeping architecture ; and so it disappointed him more than a little to get there and find that the chief place of embarkation for the pilgrim-ships was a ramshackle , dilapidated structure , peeling green paint on its sides , tattered banners flapping in the wind . Worse was in store . The pier seemed deserted . After some prowling Zalzan Kavol found a departure schedule posted in a dark corner of the ticket house . Pilgrim-ships sailed for the Isle the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spaced more widely because of prevailing unfavorable winds . The last ship of the season had departed a week ago Starday . The next left in three months . " Three months ! " Valentine cried . " What will we do in Piliplok for three months ? Juggle in the streets ? Beg ? Steal ? Read the schedule again , Zalzan Kavol ! " " It will say the same , " the Skandar declared . He grimaced . " Ip215am fond of Piliplok beyond any place , but I have no love for it at wind-time . What foul luck ! " " Do no ships at all sail in this season ? " Valentine asked . " Only the dragon-ships , " said Zalzan Kavol . " And what are they ? " " Fishing vessels , that prey on the sea-dragons , which come together in herds to mate at this time of year , and are easily taken . Plenty of dragon-ships set forth now . But what use are they to us ? " " How far out to sea do they go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their catch . Sometimes as far as the Rodamaunt Archipelago , if the dragons are swarming easterly . " " Where is that ? " Deliamber said , " It is a long chain of islands far out in the Inner Sea , perhaps midway from here to the Isle of Sleep . " " Inhabited ? " " Quite heavily . " " Good . Surely there 's commerce between islands , then . What if we hire one of these dragon-ships to take us on as passengers , and carry us as far as the Archipelago , and there we commission some local captain to transport us to the Isle ? " " Possibly , " Deliamber said . " There 's no rule requiring all pilgrims to arrive by pilgrim-ship ? " " None that I know of , " said the Vroon . " The dragon-ships will not care to bother with passengers , " Zalzan Kavol objected . " They never carry any such trade . " " Would a few royals arouse their interest in doing so ? " The Skandar looked doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lucrative one as it is . They might consider passengers a nuisance , or even bad luck . Wor would they necessarily agree to haul us out to the Archipelago , if it happens to lie beyond this year 's hunting track . Nor can we be sure , even if we do reach the Archipelago , that anyone there would be willing to carry us farther . " " On the other hand , " Valentine said , " it might all be quite easy to arrange . We have money , and I 'd rather use it persuading seacaptainsto give us passage than spend it on lodgings and food for the next three months in Piliplok . Where can we find the dragon-hunters ? " An entire section of the waterfront spanning three or four miles was set apart for their use , pier after pier after pier , and there were dozens of the huge wooden vessels in harbor , being outfitted for the new hunting season just beginning . The dragon-ships were of one de/sign , and an ominous and morbid one it was , Valentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbellying hulls and enormousfanciful three-pronged masts , and terrifying toothy figureheads at their prows and long spiky tails at their sterns . Most were decorated along their flanks with bold scarlet-and-yellow eye-patterns or rapacious-lookingrows of white teeth ; and high abovedecks were bristling cupolas for the harpooners and mammoth winches for the nets , and bloodstained platforms where the butchering took place . To Valentine it was incongruous to make use of such a killer-vessel in reaching the peaceful and holy Isle of Sleep . But he had no other way . And even this way soon began to seem doubtful . From ship to ship they went , from wharf to wharf , from drydock to drydock , and the dragon-captains listened without interest to their proposal and made swift refusals . Zalzan Kavol did most of the speaking , for the captains were mainly Skandars and might give sympathetic ear to one of their own kind . But no persuasion would sway them . " You would be a distraction to the crew , " said the first captain . " Forever stumbling over gear , getting seasick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chartered to carry passengers , " said the second . " The rules are strict . " " The Archipelago lies south of our preferred waters , " the third declared . " I have long believed , " said the fourth , " that a dragon-ship that goes to sea with strangers to the guild on board is a ship that will never return to Piliplok . I choose not to test that superstition this year . " " Pilgrims are no concern of mine , " the fifth told them . " Let the Lady waft you to the Isle , if she will . You wo n't get there aboard my ship . " The sixth also refused , adding that no captain was likely to aid them . The seventh said the same . The eighth , having heard that a party of drylanders was wandering the decks looking for passage , refusedeven to speak with them . The ninth captain , a grizzled old Skandar with gaps in her teeth and faded fur , was more friendly than the others , though just as unwilling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , have a suggestion . " On Prestimion Pier , " she said , " you will find Captain Gorzval of the Brangalyn . Gorzval has made several unlucky voyages and is known to be short of funds ; I heard him in a tavern just the other night trying to arrange a loan to pay for repairs to his hull . Itp217may be that some extra revenue from passengers would be useful to him now . " " And where is Prestimion Pier ? " Zalzan Kavol asked . " The farthest in this line , beyond Dekkeret and Kinniken , just west of the salvage-yard . " A berth close by the salvage-yard seemed appropriate for the lirangalyn , Valentine thought bleakly an hour later , upon having his first view of Captain Gorzval 's vessel . It looked about ready to be broken up for scrap . It was a smaller and older ship than the others he had seen , and at some point in its long history it must have suffered a staved hull , for in its rebuilding it had become malproportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starboard . The painted eyes and teeth along the waterline had lost their luster ; the figurehead was awry ; the tailspikes had been snapped off eight or ten feet from their mountings , perhaps in a petulant swipe by an angry dragon ; the masts had lost some of their yards also . Crewmen with a sluggish and dispirited look to them were at work , but not in any very effective way , caulking and coiling ropes and mending sail . Captain Gorzval himself seemed as weary and worn as his vessel . He was a Skandar not quite as tall as Lisamon Hultin  --  virtually a dwarf among his race  --  with a cast in one eye and a stump where his outer left arm should be . His fur was matted and coarse ; his shoulderswere slumped ; his entire look was one of fatigue and defeat . But he brightened immediately at Zalzan Kavol 's query about taking passengers to the Rodamaunt Archipelago . " How many ? " " Twelve . Four Skandars , a Hjort , a Vroon , five humans , and oneother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All pilgrims . " Gorzval made the sign of the Lady in a perfunctory way and anal , You know it 's irregular for passengers to travel on a dragonip . But I owe the Lady recompense for past favors received . I 'm willing to make an exception . Cash in advance ? " " Of course , " said Zalzan Kavol . Valentine quickly released his breath . This was a miserable dilapidatedship , and Gorzval probably a third-rate navigator dogged by bad fi , rt.une or even downright incompetence ; nevertheless , he was willing to take them , and no one else would even entertain the idea . Gorzval named his price and waited , with obvious tension , to be haggled with . What he asked was less than half what they had unsuc/cessfully offered the other captains . Zalzan Kavol , bargaining out of habit and pride , no doubt , attempted to cut three royals from that . Gorzval , plainly dismayed , offered a reduction of a royal and a half ; Zalzan Kavol appeared ready to shave another few crowns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly to say , " Done . When do we sail ? " " In three days , " Gorzval said . It turned out to be four , actually  --  Gorzval spoke vaguely of some need for additional refitting , by which he meant , Valentine discovered , patching of some fairly serious leaks . He had not been able to afford it until his passengers had hired on . According to the gossip in the dockside taverns , Lisamon Hultin reported , Gorzval had been trying to mortgage part of his catch to raise the money for carpenters , but found no takers . He had , she said , a doubtful reputation : his judgment was inferior , his luck poor , his crew ill-paid and shiftless . Once he had missed the sea-dragon swarm entirely and returned empty to Piliplok ; on another voyage he had lost his arm to a lively little dragon not quite as dead as he thought ; and on this last one the Brangalyn had been struck amidships by an irritated beast and nearly sent to the bottom . " We might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to swim to the Isle . " " Possibly we 'll bring our captain better luck than he 's had , " said Valentine . Sleet laughed . " If optimism alone could carry one to the throne , my lord , you 'd be on Castle Mount by Winterday . " Valentine laughed with him . But after the disaster in Piurifayne he hoped he was not leading these folk into new catastrophe aboard this ill-favored vessel . They were following him , after all , on faith alone , on the evidence of dreams and wizardry and an enigmatic Metamorphprank : it would be shame and pain for him if , in his haste to reach the Isle , he caused them more grief . Yet Valentine felt powerful sympathy for the bedraggled stump-armed Gorzval . An unlucky marinerhe might be  --  but a fitting helmsman , perhaps , for a Coronal so frowned upon by fortune that he had managed to lose throne and memory and identity all in a single night ! On the eve of the Brangalyn 's departure Vinorkis drew Valentine aside and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being watched . " " How do you know ? " The Hjort smiled and preened his orange mustachios . " When one has done a little spying , one recognizes the traits in others . I 've noticed a grayish Skandar lounging around the docks these past few days , asking questions of Gorzval 's people . One of the ship 's carpenters toldp219me he was curious about the passengers Gorzval had taken on , and about our destination . " Valentine scowled . " I hoped we had shaken them off our track in the jungles ! " " They must have discovered us again in Ni-moya , my lord . " " Then we must lose them again in the Archipelago , " said Valentine . " And be wary until then of other spies along our way . I thank you , Vinorkis . " " No thanks are needed , my lord . It is my duty . " A strong wind blew from the south in the morning when the ship set forth . Vinorkis kept close look for the inquisitive Skandar at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ; his work was done , Valentine supposed , and some other informant farther on would continue the surveillance on the usurper 's behalf . The route lay to the east and south ; these dragon-ships were accustomed to tack against that constant hostile wind all the way to the hunting-grounds . It was a wearying business , but there was no avoiding it , for the sea-dragons were within the reach of hunters only at this season . The Brangalyn had supplementary engine power , but not any great deal of it , fuels of all kinds being so scarce on Majipoor . With a certain majestic clumsiness the Brangalyn picked up the side wind and moved out of Piliplok harbor into the open sea . This was the smaller sea of Majipoor , the Inner Sea , which separatedeastern Zimroel from western Alhanroel . It was no trifle  --  some five thousand miles from shore to shore  --  yet it was a mere puddle compared with the Great Sea that occupied most of the other hemisphere , an ocean beyond the possibility of navigation , untold thousands of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in scale , and was broken midway between the continents by the Isle of Sleep  --  itself big enough so that on another world , of less extraordinary size , it would be considered a continent  --  and by several major island chains . The sea-dragons spent their lives in unending migration between the two oceans . Round and round the globe they went , taking years or even decades , so far as anyone knew , to make the circumnavigation . Perhaps a dozen great herds of them inhabited the ocean , traveling constantly from west to east . Every summer one of those herds would complete its journey across the Great Sea , passing south of Narabal and up the southern coast of Zimroel toward Piliplok . It was forbidden to hunt them then , for the herd abounded at that time with pregnant cows . By autumn the young were born , the herd now having reached the windswept waters between Piliplok and the Isle of Sleep , and the annual hunt began . Out from Piliplok came the dragon-ships inp220great numbers . The herds were thinned of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back into the tropics , passing south of the Isle of Sleep , rounding the hump of Alhanroel 's lengthy Stoienzar Peninsula , and heading on eastward below Alhanroel to the Great Sea , where they would swim unmolested until their time brought them round to Piliplok again . Of all the beasts of Majipoor , the sea-dragons were by far the largest . Newborn , they were tiny , no more than five or six feet in length , but through all their lives they continued to grow , and their lifespans were long , although no one knew just how long . Gorzval , who let his passengers share his table and proved to be a talkative man now that his anxieties were behind him , was fond of telling tales of the immensity of certain sea-dragons . One that had been taken in the reign of Lord Malibor was a hundred and ninety feet in length , and another , of Confalume 's time , two hundred forty , and in the era when Prestimion was Pontifex and Lord Dekkeret the Coronal they had caught one thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorzval , was one that had boldly appeared almost in the mouth of Piliplok harbor in the reign of Thimin and Lord Kinniken , and had reliably been measured at three hundred fifteen feet . That monster , known as Lord Kinniken 's dragon , had escaped unharmed because the entire fleet of dragon-ships was then far out to sea . Allegedly it had been sighted again several times by hunters in succeeding centuries , most recently in the year Lord Voriax became Coronal , but no one had ever laid a harpoon on it , and among hunters it had a baleful reputation . " It must be five hundred feet long by now , " said Gorzval , " and I pray that some other captain is given the honor of encountering it when it returns to our waters . " Valentine had seen small sea-dragons , pithed , gutted , salted , and dried , sold in marketplaces all over Zimroel , and on occasion he had tasted their meat , which was dark , tangy , and tough . Dragons less than ten feet long were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , up to fifty feet or so , was butchered and sold fresh along the eastern coast of Zimroel , but difficulties of transportation kept it from finding markets far from the sea . Beyond that length the dragonswere too old to be edible , but their flesh was rendered into oil that had many purposes , petroleum and other fossil hydrocarbons being scarce on Majipoor . The bones of sea-dragons of all sizes had their uses in architecture , for they were nearly as strong as steel and far more readily obtained , and there was medicinal value in the unborn dragon-eggs , found in quantities of many hundreds of pounds in the abdomens of mature females . Dragon-skin , dragon-wings , dragonp221this and dragon that , everything was put to some benefit and nothing wasted . " This , for example , is dragon-milk , " said Gorzval , offering his guests a flask of a pale bluish liquid . " In Ni-moya or Khyntor they 'd pay ten crowns for a flask like this . Here , taste it . " Lisamon Hultin took a hesitant sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon-piss ? " she demanded . The captain smiled frostily . " In Dulorn , " he said , " what you spat out would cost you at least a crown , and you 'd count yourself lucky to find some . " He pushed the flask toward Sleet , who shook his head , and then to Valentine . After a moment 's pause Valentine put it to his lips . " Bitter , " he said , " and a musty taste , but not entirely terrible . What 's the secret of its appeal ? " The Skandar patted his thighs . " Aphrodisiac ! " he boomed . " Stirs the juices ! Heats the blood ! Prolongs the life ! " He pointed jovially at Zalzan Kavol , who , unasked , had taken a robust swig of the stuff . " See ? The Skandar knows ! The man of Piliplok does n't need to be begged to drink it ! " Carabella said , " Dragon-milk ? These are mammals ? " " Mammals , yes . The eggs are hatched within , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a litter , rows of nipples all up and down the belly . You think it 's odd , milk from dragons ? " " I think of dragons as reptiles , " said Carabella , " and reptiles give no milk . " " Think of dragons as dragons , better . You want to taste ? " " Thank you , no , " she replied . " My juices need no stirring . " The meals in the captain 's cabin were the best part of the voyage , Valentine decided . Gorzval was good-natured and outgoing , as Skandarswent , and he set a decent table , with wine and meats and fish of various sorts , including a good deal of dragon-flesh . But the ship itself was creaky and cramped , poorly designed and even more poorly maintained , and the crew , a dozen Skandars and an assortment of Hjorts and humans , was uncommunicative and often downright hostile . Obviously these dragon-hunters were a proud and insular lot , even the crew of a bedraggled vessel like the Brangalyn , and resented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries . Only Gorzval seemed at all hospitable ; but he clearly felt grateful to hem , for their fare was all that had allowed him to get his ship seaworthy . They were far from land now , in a featureless realm where pale blue ocean met pale blue sky to obliterate all sense of place and direction . The course was south-southeasterly , and the farther they gotp222from Piliplok the warmer grew the wind , hot now and dry as ever . " We call the wind our sending , " said Gorzval , " because it comes straight from Suvrael . The little gift of the King of Dreams , it is , as delightful as all his others . " The sea was empty : no islands , no drifting logs , no sign of anything , not even dragons . The dragons had gone far past the coast this year , as they sometimes did , and were basking in the tropical waters close by the fringes of the Archipelago . Occasionallya gihorna-bird passed far overhead , making its autumn migration from the islands to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but on the coast five hundred miles south of Piliplok ; these long-legged creatures must have made tempting targets , but no one took aim at them . Another tradition of the sea , it seemed . The first dragons manifested themselves the second week out from Piliplok . Gorzval predicted their arrival a day in advance , having dreamed that they were near . " Every captain dreams dragons , " he explained . " Our minds are attuned to them : we feel their souls approachingus . There 's a captain , a woman with some teeth out , Guidrag'sher name , who can dream them a week away , sometimes more . Heads right to them and they 're always there . Me , I 'm not that good , ca n't do better than a day 's distance . But nobody 's as good as Guidrag , anyway . I do my best . We 'll have dragons off the bow in another ten , twelve hours , that 's a guarantee . " Valentine had little confidence in the Skandar captain 's guarantees . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hoy ! Dragons ho ! " A great many of them , forty , fifty , maybe more , swarmed just off the Brangalyn 's bow . They were big-bellied ungraceful beasts , broad in cross-section like the Brangalyn itself , with long thick necks , heavy triangular heads , short tails terminating in flat flaring flukes , and prominent ridges of bony projections running the length of their highvaultedbacks . Their wings were the strangest feature of all  --  fins , really , for it was inconceivable that these huge creatures should ever take to the air , but they looked far more like wings than fins , batwings , dark and leathery , sprouting from massive stumpy bases below the sea-dragons ' necks and sweeping down half the length of their bodies . Most of the dragons kept their wings folded like cloaks , but some had them fully outspread , fanning them out along the axes provided by long fragile-looking finger-bones , and with them they covered the water about them for astonishing spreads , unfurling them like black tarpaulins . Most of the dragons were young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many newborn ones , six-footers or thereabouts , swim/ming and splashing freely or else gripping the nipples of their mothers , who tended to be of mid-size range . But among the school drifted a few monsters , half submerged and somnolent , their spine-ridges rising high above the water like the central hills of some floating island . They were unimaginably bulky . It was hard to judge their full magnitude , for their hindquarters tended to droop out of sight , but two or three of them looked at least as large as the ship . As Gorzval passed him on the deck Valentine said , " We do n't have Lord Kinniken 's dragon out there , do we ? " The Skandar captain chuckled indulgently . " Nay , the Kinniken 's three times the size of those , at least . Three ? More than three ! Those are hardly hundred-fifty-footers . I 've seen dozens bigger . So will you , friend , before long . " Valentine tried to imagine dragons three times the size of the biggest out there . His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of Castle Mount : one simply could not do it . The ship moved in for the kill . It was a smoothly coordinated operation . Boats were lowered , with a lance-wielding Skandar strapped upright in the bow of each . Among the nursing dragons the boats quietly moved , the lancer spearing one here , one there , apportioning the kill among the mothers so that none was aroused by total loss of her young . These young dragons were lashed by their tails to the boats ; and as the boats returned to the ship , nets were lowered to hoist the catch . Only when some dozen young dragons had been taken did the hunters go for bigger game . The boats were retracted and the harpooner , a giant Skandar with a naked dull-blue swath across his chest where the fur had long ago been ripped away , took his place in the cupola . Unhurriedly he selected his weapon and nocked it into its catapult while Gorzval maneuvered the ship to give him a good shot at the chosen victim . The harpooner took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that he was holding his breath and intently squeezing Carabella 's hand . Then the gleaming somber shaft of the harpoon was released . It buried itself to its haft in the blubbery shoulder of a dragon some ninety feet long and instantly the sea came alive . The wounded dragon lashed the surface with its tail and unfurled its wings , which beat against the water in titanic fury , as though the animal meant to burst into the air and soar off , dragging the dangling Brangalyn behind it . At that first frantic outburst of pain the mother-dragons opened their wings as well , gathering their nurslingsinto a protective shield , and with powerful strokes of their tailsbegan to move away , while the largest of the herd , the utter monsters ,  |p224sim|ply  sank from view , letting themselves glide into the depths with scarcely a ripple of energy . This left a dozen or so adolescent dragons , who knew that something disturbing was happening but were not sure how to react ; they swam in wide circles around their wounded comrade , holding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Meanwhile the harpooner , still choosinghis weapons in absolute tranquillity , put a second and a third into his prey , close by the first . " Boats ! " cried Gorzval . " Nets ! " Now began a strange proceeding . Once more the boats were lowered , and the hunters rowed forth . Toward the ring of excited dragons they headed , and hurled into the water grenades of some sort that exploded with dull booming sounds , spreading a slick coating of bright yellow dye . The explosions and , it seemed , the dye sent the remaining dragons into a frenzy of terror . With wild thrashings of wings and tails they swam swiftly out of sight . Only the victim remained , very much alive but held fast . It too was swimming , in a northerly direction , but it towed the entire mass of the Brangalyn along behind it , and it was visibly weakened moment by moment by the effort . The boatmen , with their dye-grenades , attempted to force the dragon closer to the ship ; at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which by some interior mechanism opened and spread out over the water , and closed again when the dragon had entangled itself in its meshes . " Winches ! " Gorzval roared , and the net rose from the water . The dragon dangled in mid-air . Its enormous weight caused the huge ship to list alarmingly . Far above , the harpooner rose in his cupola for the coup de grace . He gripped the catapult with all four hands and let fly . A ferocious grunt came from him as he released the weapon and an instant later came an answering sound , hollow , agonized , from the dragon . The harpoon penetrated the dragon 's skull at a point just behind the great saucerlike green eyes . The mighty wings raked the air in one last terrible convulsion . The rest was mere butchery . The winches did their work , the dragon was hoisted to the slaughter-block , the stripping of the carcass began . Valentine watched awhile , until the gory spectacle palled : the flensing of the blubber , the securing of the valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest . When he had had enough he went below , and when he returned a few hours later the skeleton of the dragon rose like a museum exhibit over the deck , a great white arch topped by that bizarre spiny ridge , and the hunters were at work disassembling even that.  | " You look grim , " Carabella said to him . " I lack appreciation of this art , " he answered . It seemed to Valentine that Gorzval could entirely have filled the hold of his vessel , large as it was , with the proceeds of this one school of dragons . But he had chosen a handful of young and only one adult , not by any means the largest , and had deliberately driven the others away . Zalzan Kavol explained that there were quotas , decreedby Coronals in centuries past , to prevent overfishing : herds were to be thinned , not exterminated , and a ship that returned too soon from its voyage would be called to account and subjected to severe penalties . Besides , it was essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , and to process the flesh swiftly ; a crew that hunted too greedily would be unable to handle its own catch in an effective and profitable way . The season 's first kill seemed to make Gorzval 's crew more mellow . They nodded occasionally at the passengers , even smiled now and then , and went about their own tasks in a relaxed and almost cheerful way . Their sullen silence melted ; they laughed , joked , sang on deck : Lord Malibor was fine and bold And loved the heaving sea , Lord Malibor came off the Mount , A hunter for to be . Lord Malibor prepared his ship , A gallant sight was she , With sails all of beaten gold , And masts of ivory . Valentine and Carabella heard the singers  --  it was the squad barrelingthe blubber  --  and went aft to listen more closely . Carabella , quickly picking up the simple robust melody , quietly began to finger it on her pocket-harp , adding little fanciful cadenzas between the verses . Lord Malibor stood at the helmAnd faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , The dragon fierce and brave . Lord Malibor a challenge called , His voice did boom and ring . " I wish to meet , I wish to fight , " Quoth he , " the dragon-king. "  | " I hear , my lord , " the dragon cried , And came across the sea . Twelve miles long and three miles wide And two miles deep was he . " Look , " Carabella said . " There 's Zalzan Kavol . " Valentine glanced across the way . Yes , there was the Skandar , listening at the far side near the rail , all his arms folded , a deepening scowl on his face . He did not seem to be enjoying the song . What was the matter with him ? Lord Malibor stood on the deckAnd fought both hard and well . Thick was the blood that flowed that day And great the blows that fell . But dragon-kings are old and sly , And rarely are they beaten . Lord Malibor , for all his strength , Eventually was eaten . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale take heed ! Despite all luck and skill , you may End up as dragon-feed . Valentine laughed and clapped his hands . That brought an immediatefierce glare from Zalzan Kavol , who strode toward them looking huffy with indignation . " My lord ! " he cried . " Will you tolerate such irreverent  --  " " Not so loud on the my lord , " Valentine said crisply . " Irreverent , you say ? What are you talking about ? " " No respect for a terrible tragedy ! No respect for a fallen Coronal ! No respect for  --  " " Zalzan Kavol ! " Valentine said slyly . " Are you such a lover of respectability , then ? " " I know what is right and what is wrong , my lord . To mock the death of Lord Malibor is  --  " " Be more easy , my friend , " Valentine said gently , putting his hand on one of the Skandar 's gigantic forearms . " Where Lord Malibor has gone , he is far beyond matters of respect or disrespect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I take no offense , Zalzan Kavol , why should you ? " But Zalzan Kavol continued to grumble and bluster . " If I mayp227say it , my lord , you may not yet be returned to a full sense of the rightness of things . If I were you , I would go to those sailors now and order them never to sing such a thing again in your presence . " " In my presence ? " Valentine said , with a broad grin . " Why should they care dragon-spittle for my presence ? Who am I but a passenger , barely tolerated at all ? If I said any such thing , I 'd be over the rail in a minute , and dragon-feed myself the next . Eh ? Think about it , Zalzan Kavol ! And calm yourself , fellow . It 's only a silly sailor-song . " " Nevertheless , " the Skandar muttered , walking stiffly away . Carabella giggled . " He takes himself so seriously . " Valentine began to hum , then to sing : All sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale ? Of this sad tale take heed ! " Yes , that 's it , " he said . " Love , will you do me a service ? When those men are through with their work , draw one of them aside  --  the red-bearded one , I think , with the deep bass voice  --  and have him teach you the words . And then teach them to me . And I can sing it to Zalzan Kavol to make him smile , eh ? How does it go ? Let 's see  --  " " I hear , my lord , " the dragon cried , And came across the sea . Twelve miles long and three miles wide And two miles deep was heA week or thereabouts passed before they sighted dragons again , and in that time not only Carabella and Valentine learned the ditty , but Lisamon Hultin as well , who took pleasure in bellowing it across the decks in her raucous baritone . But Zalzan Kavol continued to growl and snort whenever he heard it . The second school of dragons was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking of some two dozen small ones , one midsizedone , and one titan at least a hundred thirty feet long . That kept all hands busy for the next few days . The deck ran purple with dragons ' blood , and bones and wings were stacked all over the ship as the crew labored to get everything down to storable size . At the captain 's table delicacies were offered , from the most mysterious inner parts of the creature , and Gorzval , ever more expansive , brought forth casks of fine wines , quite unsuspected from someone who had been at the edge of ' bankruptcy . " Piliplok golden , " he said , pouring with a lavish hand . " I have saved this wine for some special occasion , andp228doubtless this is it . You have brought us excellent luck . " " Your fellow captains will not be joyed to hear that , " Valentine said . " We might easily have sailed with them , if they had only known how charmed we were . " " Their loss , our gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Skandar captain . They were moving now through ever more balmy waters . The hot wind out of Suvrael relented here at the edge of the tropics , and a kinder , moister breeze came to them out of the southwest , from the distant Stoienzar Peninsula of Alhanroel . The water was a deep green hue , sea-birds were numerous , algae grew so thick in places that navigation was sometimes impeded , and brightly colored fish could be seen darting just below the surface  --  the prey of the dragons , who were flesh-eaters and swam open-mouthed through swarms of lesser sea-creatures . The Rodamaunt Archipelago now lay not far away . Gorzval proposed to complete his haul here : the Brangalyn had room for another few large dragons , two more of mid-size , and perhaps forty of the small , and then he would drop his passengers and head for Piliplok to market his catch . " Dragons ho ! " came the lookout 's cry . This was the greatest school yet , hundreds of them , spiny humps rising above the water everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at will . On the horizon other ships could be seen , but they were far off , for strict rules governed impinging on hunting territory . Gorzval seemed to glow with the success of his voyage . He himself took frequent turns in the boat-crews , which Valentine gathered was unusual , and once he even made his way to the cupola to wield a harpoon . The ship now was settling low to the waterline with the weight of dragon-flesh . On the third day dragons were still close about them , undismayed by the carnage and unwilling to scatter . " One more big one , " Gorzval vowed , " and then we make for the islands . " He selected an eighty-footer for the final target . Valentine had grown bored , and more than bored , with the butchery , and as the harpooner sent his third shaft into the prey he turned away , and walked to the far side of the deck . There he found Sleet , and they stood by the rail , peering off to the east . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Valentine asked . " I long for solid land again , and an end to the stink of dragonbloodin my nostrils . "  | " My eyes are keen , my lord , but the islands are two days ' sailing from here , and I think even my vision has limits . But  --  " Sleet gasped . " My lord  --  " " What is it ? " " An island comes swimming toward us , my lord ! " Valentine stared , but with difficulty at first : it was morning and a brilliant fiery glare lit the surface of the sea . But Sleet took Valentine'shand and pointed with it , and then Valentine saw . A ridged dragon-spine broke the water , a spine that went on and on and on , and below it a vast and implausible bulk was dimly visible . " Lord Kinniken 's dragon ! " Valentine said in a choked voice . " And it comes straight at us ! " Kinniken 's it might be , or more likely some other not nearly so great , hut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was bearing clown on them steadily and unhesitatingly  --  either an avenging angel or else an unthinking force , there was no knowing that , but its mass was unarguable . " Where is Gorzval ? " Sleet blurted . " Weapons  --  guns  --  " Valentine laughed . " As easily stop a rock-slide with a harpoon , Sleet . Are you a good swimmer ? " Most of the hunters were preoccupied with their catch . But some had looked the other way now , and there was frantic activity on deck . The harpooner had whirled round and stood outlined against the sky , weapons in every hind . Others had mounted the adjoining cupolas . Valentine , searching for Carabella and Deliamber and the others , caught sight of Gorzval rushing madly toward the helm ; the Skandar 's face was livid and his eyes were bugging , and he looked like one who stood in the presence of the ministers of death . " Lower the boats ! " someone screamed . Winches turned . Figures ran about wildly . One , a Hjort black-cheeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him roughly by the arm , muttering , " Youbrought this on us ! You should never have been allowed on board , deny of you ! " Lisamon Hultin appeared from somewhere and swept the Hjort aside like so much chaff . Then she flung her powerful arms around Valentine as if to protect him from any harm that might come.  | " The Hjort was right , you know , " said Valentine calmly . " We are an ill-omened bunch . First Zalzan Kavol loses his wagon , and now poor Gorzval loses  --  " There was a ghastly impact as the onrushing dragon crashed broadside into the Brangalyn . The ship heeled over as though it had been pushed by a giant 's hand , then rolled dizzyingly back the other way . An awful shudder shook its timbers . A secondary impact came  --  the wings hitting the hull , the thrashing flukes ?  --  and then another , and the Brangalyn bobbed like a cork . " We 're stove in ! " a desperate voice cried . Things rolled free on the deck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hapless crewmen , a case of boning-axes ripping loose and skidding over the side . As the ship continued to sway and lurch , Valentine caught a glimpse of the great dragon on the far side , where the recent catch still hung , unbalancing everything ; and the monster swung around and headed in for another attack . There could be no doubt now of the purposefulness of its onslaught . The dragon struck , shoulder-side on ; the Brangalyn rocked wildly ; Valentine grunted as Lisamon Hultin 's grip became an almost crushingembrace . He had no idea where any of the others might be , nor whether they would survive . Clearly the ship was doomed . Already it was listing badly as water poured into the hold . The tail of the dragon rose nearly to deck-level and struck again . Everything dissolved into chaos . Valentine felt himself flying ; he soared gracefully , he dippedand bobbed , he plunged with elegance and skill toward the water . He landed in something much like a whirlpool and was drawn down into the terrible turbulent spin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballad of Lord Malibor ringing in his mind . In truth that Coronal had taken a fancy for dragon-hunting some ten years back , and had gone out in what was said to be the finest dragon-ship in Piliplok , and the ship had been lost with all hands . No one knew what had happened , but  --  so it came out of Valentine 's spotty recollections  --  the government had spoken of a sudden storm . More likely , he thought , it had been this killer-beast , this avenger of dragonkind . Twelve miles long and three miles wide And two miles deep was heAnd now a second Coronal , successor but one to Malibor , would meet the same fate . Valentine was oddly unmoved by that . He had thought himself dying in the rapids of the Steiche , and had survived that ; here , with a hundred miles of sea between him and any sortp231of safety , and a rampaging monster lashing about close at hand , he was even more surely doomed , but there was no use bemoaning it . The Divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was that others whom he loved would die with him , merely because they had been loyal , because they had pledged themselves to follow him on his journey to the Isle , because they had tied themselves to a luckless Coronal and a luckless dragon-captain and now must share their evil destinies . He was sucked deep into the heart of the ocean and ceased to ponder the tides of luck . He struggled for breath , coughed , choked , spat out water and swallowed more . His head pounded mercilessly . Carabella , he thought , and darkness engulfed him . Valentine had never , since awakening out of his broken past to find himself near Pidruid , given much thought to a philosophy of death . Life held challenges enough for him . He recalled vaguely what he had been taught in boyhood , that all souls return to the Divine Source at their last moment when the release of life-energy comes , and travel over the Bridge of Farewells , the bridge that is the prime responsibility of ' the Pontifex . But whether there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond , and if so of what sort , Valentine had never paused to consider . Now , though , he returned to consciousness in a place so strange that it surpassed the imaginings of even the most fertile of thinkers . Was this the afterlife ? It was a giant chamber , a great silent room with thick moist pink walls and a roof that was in places high and domed , supported by mighty pillars , and in other places drooped until it nearly touched the floor . In that roof were mounted huge glowing hemispheres that emitted a faint blue light , as if by phosphorescence . The air in here was rank and steamy , and had a sharp , bitter flavor , unpleasant and stifling . Valentine lay on his side against a wet slippery surface , rough to the touch , deeply corrugated , quivering with constant deep palpitations and tremors . He put the flat of his hand to it and felt a kind of convulsion deep within . The texture of the ground was like nothing he had known before , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had entered was not the world after death but merely some grotesque hat Iucination . Valentine got unsteadily to his feet . His clothing was soaked , he had lost one boot somewhere , his lips burned with the taste of salt , his lungs seemed full of water , and he felt shaky and dazed ; furthermoreit was hard to keep upright on this unendingly trembling surface . Looking about , he saw by the dim pale luminosity a kind of vegetation ,  |p232|pliant  whip-shaped growths , thick and fleshy and leafless , sprouting from the ground . They too writhed with inner animation . Making his way between two lofty pillars and through an area where ceiling and floor almost met , he caught sight of what seemed to be a pond of some greenish fluid . Beyond that he was unable to see in the dimness . He walked toward the pond and perceived something exceedingly odd in it : hundreds of brightly colored fish , of the kind that he had seen flitting about in the water before the day 's hunt had begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decaying , flesh stripping away from bones , and below them in the pool was a carpet of similar bones , many feet thick . Suddenly there was a sound as of the roaring of the wind behind him . Valentine turned . The walls of the chamber were in motion , pulling back , the drooping places in the ceiling retracting to create a vast open space ; and a torrent of water came rushing toward him , as high as his hips . He barely had time to reach one of the ceilingpillarsand fling his arms tight about it ; then the inrushing of water sluiced about him with tremendous force . He held on . It seemed that half the Inner Sea was pouring past him , and for a moment he thought he would lose his grip , but then the flow subsided and the water drained away through slits that materialized abruptly in the floor  --  leaving in its wake scores of stranded fish . The floor convulsed ; the fleshy whips swept the desperate flopping fish across the floor to the greenish pool ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly Valentine understood . I am not dead , he knew , nor is this any place of afterlife . I am within the belly of the dragon . He began to laugh . Valentine threw back his head and let giant guffaws pour from him . What other response was fitting ? To cry ? To curse ? The vast beast had gobbled him whole at a gulp , had sucked in the Corona of Majipoor as heedlessly as it might a minnow . But he was too big to be propelled into that digestive pond down there , so here he was , camped on the floor of the dragon 's maw , in this cathedral of an alimentarycanal . What now ? Hold court for the fishes ? Dispense justice among them as they came sweeping in ? Settle down here and spend the rest of his days dining on raw fish stolen from the monster 's catch ? It was high comedy , Valentine thought . But dark tragedy as well , for Sleet and Carabella and young Shanamirand all the others , drawn down to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sympathies and of his awesomely bad luck . For them he felt only anguish . Carabella 's lilting voice si/lenced forever , and Sleet 's miraculous skills of hand and eye forever lost , and the rough-souled Skandars no longer to fill the air with whirlingmultitudes of knives and sickles and torches , and Shanamir cut off before he had fairly begun his lifeValentine could not bear thinking about them . For himself , though , there was only cosmic amusement at this absurd plight . To take his mind from grief and pain and loss he laughed again , and stretched his arms wide to the distant walls of the strange room . " Lord Valentine 's Castle , this is ! " he cried . " The throne-room ! I invite you all to dine with me in the grand feasting-hall ! " Out of the murky distance a booming voice called , " By my gut , I accept that invitation ! " Valentine was astounded beyond all measure . " Lisamon ? " " No , it 's the Pontifex Tyeveras and his cross-eyed uncle ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you ? " " In the gizzard of this stinking dragon ! Where are you ? " " Not far from you ! But I ca n't see you ! " " Sing , " she called . " Stay where you are and sing , and keep singing ! I 'll try to reach you ! " Valentine began , in the loudest voice he could muster : Lord Malibor was fine and bold And loved the heaving seaAgain the roaring sound came ; again the great creature 's gullet opened to admit a cascade of sea-water and a horde of fish ; again Valentine clung tp a pillar as the influx hit him . " Oh  --  by the Divine 's toes , " Lisamon cried . " Hang on , Valentine , hang on ! " He hung on until the force was spent , and slumped against the pillar , soaked , panting . Somewhere in the distance the giantess called to him , and he called back . Her voice grew nearer . She urged him to keep singing , and he did : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave , And sailed in quest of the dragon freeHe heard her occasionally bawling a snatch of the ballad herself , with amiably bawdy embellishments , as she approached through the intricacies of the dragon 's interior , and then he looked up and saw by the faint luminous light her enormous form looming above him.  |p234He  smiled at her . She smiled , and laughed , and he laughed with her , and they clasped one another in a wet , slippery embrace . But the sight of one who had survived put him in mind again of those who surely had not , and plunged him once more into grief and shame . He turned away , biting at his lip . " My lord ? " she said puzzledly . " Only we two remain , Lisamon . " " Yes , and praises be for that ! " " But the others  --  they 'd live now , if they had n't been so stupid as to go chasing across the world with me  --  " She caught him by the arm . " My lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead they be ? " " I know all that . But  --  " " We are safe . If we have lost our friends , my lord , that 's cause for sorrow indeed , but not for guilt . They followed you of their own free choice , eh , my lord ? And if their time has come , well , it is because their time has come , and how could that have been otherwise ? Will you give up this grief , my lord , and rejoice that we are safe ? " He shrugged . " Safe , yes . And yes , grief brings no one back to life . But how safe are we ? How long can we survive in here , Lisamon ? " " Long enough for me to cut us free . " She pulled her vibrationswordout of its sheath . Amazed , he said , " You think you can hack a path to the outside ? " " Why not ? I 've cut through worse . " " At the first touch of that thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sea . We 're safer in here than trying to swim up from five miles underneath . " " It was said of you that you are an optimist at the darkest time , " the warrior-woman declared . " Where 's that optimism now ? The dragon lives at the surface . It might thrash a bit , but it wo n't dive . And if we do emerge five miles down ? At least it 's a quick death . Can you breathe this foul muck forever ? Can you wander for long inside a single giant fish ? " Gingerly Lisamon Hultin touched the tip of the vibration-sword to the side wall . The thick moist flesh quivered a bit but did not recoil . " You see ? It 's got no nerves in here , " she said , driving the weapon a little deeper and turning it to excavate a cavity . There were tremors and twitches . She kept digging . " Do you think anyone else was swallowedwith us ? " she asked . " Yours was the only voice I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phaugh , what a monster ! I tried to hold you as we went overboard , but when we were struck the last time I lostp235my grip on you . We came to the same place , anyway . " She had by now opened a hole a foot deep and two feet wide in the side of the dragon 's stomach . It seemed hardly to feel the surgery at all . We are like maggots gnawing within it , Valentine thought . Lisamon Hultinsaid , " While I cut , you see if you can find anyone else . But do n't stray too far , hear ? " " I 'll be careful . " He chose a route along the stomach wall , groping in the halfdarkness , pausing twice to hang on through inrushes of water , and calling out constantly in the hope that someone might reply . No replies came . Her excavation was enormous now ; he saw her deep within t he dragon 's flesh , still hacking away . Gobbets of severed meat were ( riled on all sides and thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully as she cut . Lord Malibor stood on the deckAnd fought both hard and well . Thick was the blood that flowed that day And great the blows that fell . " How far do you think it is to the outside ? " he asked . " Half a mile or so . " " Really ? " She laughed . " I suppose ten or fifteen feet . Here , clear the opening behind me . This meat 's piling up faster than I can sweep it away . " Feeling like a butcher , and not enjoying the sensation much , Valantine seized the chunks of severed flesh and hauled them back out of the cavity , tossing them as far as he could . He shivered in horror as he saw the fleshy whips of the stomach floor seize the meat and sweep it blithely on toward the digestive pond . Any protein was welcomehere , so it seemed . Deeper , deeper they traveled into the dragon 's abdominal wall . Valentine tried to calculate the probable width of it , taking the length the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arithmetic became a muddle . They were working in close quarters and in a foul , hot atmosphere . The blood , the raw meat , the sweat , the narrowness ' Of the cavity  --  it was hard to imagine a more repellent place . Valentine looked back . " The hole 's closing behind us ! " " Beast that lives forever must have tricks of healing , " the giantess Muttered . She thrust and gouged and hacked . Uneasily Valentine watched new flesh sprouting as if by magic , the wound healing with phenomenal speed . What if they became encapsulated in this opening ? Inuit hared by joining flesh ? Lisamon Hultin pretended to be unwor/ried , but he saw her working harder , faster , grunting and moaning , standing with colossal legs planted far apart and shoulders braced . The gash was sealed to their rear , pink new meat covering the hole , and now it was closing at the sides . Lisamon Hultin slashed and cut with furious intensity , and Valentine continued his humbler task of clearing the debris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibly diminished , and the hole seemed to be closing almost as fast as she could cut . " Do n't know if I  --  can keep  --  it up  --  " she muttered . " Give me the sword , then ! " She laughed . " Watch out ! You ca n't do it ! " In wild rage she returned to the struggle , bellowing curses at the dragon 's flesh as it sprouted around her . It was impossible now to tell where they were ; they were burrowing through a realm without landmarks . Her grunts grew sharper and shorter . " Maybe we should try to go back to the stomach area , " he suggested . " Before we 're trapped so  --  " " No ! " she roared . " I think we 're getting there ! Not so meaty here  --  tougher , more like muscle  --  maybe the sheath just under the hide  --  " Suddenly sea-water poured in on them . " We 're through ! " Lisamon Hultin cried . She turned , seizing Valentineas though he were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening in the monster 's flank . Her arms were locked in i fierce grip around his hips . She gave one tremendous thrust and he barely had time to fill his lungs with air before he was projected out through the slippery walls into the cool green embrace of the ocean . Lisamon Hultin emerged just after him , still gripping him tightly , now by his ankle and then by his wrist , and they rocketed upward , upward , rising like corks . For what seemed like hours they flew toward the surface . Valentine'sforehead ached . His ribs soon would burst . His chest was on fire . We are climbing from the very bottom of the sea , he thought bleakly , and we will drown before we reach the air , or our blood will boil the way it does in divers who go too deep in search of the eyestones off Til-omon , or we will be squeezed flat by the pressure , orHe erupted into clear sweet air , popping nearly the full length of his body out of the water and falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw on the waters , weak , trembling , struggling for breath . Lisamon Hultin floated alongside . The warm beautiful sun blazed wonderfully , straight overhead . He was alive , and he was unharmed , and he was free of the dragon . And he bobbed somewhere on the breast of the Inner Sea , a hundred miles from anywhere.  |p237When  the first moments of exhaustion had passed , he raised his head and peered about . The dragon was still visible , hump and ridge above the surface , only a few hundred yards away . But it seemed placid and appeared to be swimming slowly in the opposite direction . Of t he Brangalyn there was no trace  --  only scattered timbers over a broad span of ocean . Nor were other survivors in view . They swam to the nearest timber , a good-sized strip of the hull , and flung themselves across it . For a long while neither of them spoke . At length Valentine said , " And now do we swim to the Archipelago ? Or should we simply go straight on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , my lord . We could ride on the dragon 's back . " " But how guide him ? " " Tug on the wings , " she suggested . " I have my doubts of that . " They were silent again . Valentine said , " At least in the belly of the dragon we had a fresh catch of fish delivered every few minutes . " " And the inn was large , " Lisamon Hultin added . " But poorly ventilated . I think I prefer it here . " " But how long can we drift like this ? " She looked at him strangely . " Do you doubt that we 'll be rescued , my lord ? " " It seems reasonably in doubt , yes . " " It was prophesied to me in a dream from the Lady , " said the giantess , " that nay death would come in a dry place when I was very old . I am still young and this place is the least dry on all of Majipoor , except perhaps the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . I will not perish here , and neither will you . " " A comforting revelation , " Valentine said . " But what will we do ? " " Can you accomplish sendings , my lord ? " " I was Coronal , not King of Dreams . " " But any mind can reach any other , with true intent ! Do you think only the King and Lady have such skills ? The little wizard Deliamber talked into minds at night , I know that , and Gorzval said he spoke with dragons in his sleep , and you  --  " " I am barely myself , Lisamon . Such of my mind as is left to me will send no sendings . " " Try . Reach out across the waters . To the Lady your mother , my lord , or to her people on the Isle , or to the folk of the Archipelago . You have the power . I am only a stupid swinger of swords , but you ,  |p238lord  , have a mind that was deemed worthy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need  --  " The giantess seemed transfigured with passion . " Do it , Lord Valentine ! Call for help , and help will come ! " Valentine was skeptical . He knew little of the network of dreamcommunicationthat seemed to bind this planet together ; it did appear that mind often called to mind , and of course there were the Powers of the Isle and of Suvrael supposedly sending directed messages forth by some means of mechanical amplification , but yet , drifting here on a slab of wood in the ocean , body and clothes filthied with the flesh and blood of the giant beast that lately had swallowed him , spirit so drained by unending adversity that even his legendary sunny faith in luck and miracles was put to rout  --  how could he hope to summon aid across such a gulf ? He closed his eyes . He sought to concentrate the energies of his mind in a single point deep within his skull . He imagined a glowing spark of light there , a hidden radiance that he could tap and beam forth . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature might soon be nibbling at his dangling feet . He distracted himself with fears that any messages he might send would reach only as far as the hazy mind of the dragon nearby , that had destroyed the Brangalyn and almost all its people , and now might wish to turn back and finish the job . Still , he tried . For all his doubts , he owed it to Lisamon Hultin to make the attempt . He held himself still , barely breathing , seeking intently to do whatever it might be that could transmit such a message . On and off during the afternoon and early evening he attempted it . Darkness came on quickly , and the water grew strangely luminescent , flickering with a ghostly greenish light . They did not dare sleep at the same time , for fear they might slip from the timber and be lost ; so they took turns , and when it was Valentine 's turn he fought hard for wakefulness , thinking more than once that he was losing consciousness . Creatures swam near them in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From time to time Valentine tried the sending-forth of messages again . But he saw no avail in it . We are lost , he thought . Toward morning he gave himself up to sleep , and had perplexing dreams of dancing eels atop the water . Vaguely , while sleeping , he strived to reach far-off minds with his mind , and then he slipped into a slumber too deep for that . And woke to the touch of Lisamon Hultin 's hand on his shoulder " My lord ? "  |p239He  opened his eyes and looked at her in bewilderment . " My lord , you may stop making sendings now . We are saved ! " " What ? " " A boat , my lord ! See ? From the east ? " Wearily he raised his head and followed her gesture . A boat , yes , a small one , coming toward them . Oars flashing in the sunlight . Hallucination , he thought . Delusion . Mirage . But the boat grew larger against the horizon , and then it was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was sprawled feebly against someone and someone else was putting a flask to his lips , a cool drink , wine , water , he had no way of telling , and they were peeling off his soggy befouled garments and wrapping him in something clean and dry . Strangers , two men and a woman , with great manes of tawny hair and clothing of an unfamiliar sort . He heard Lisamon Hultin talking with them , but the words were blurred and indistinct , and he made no attempt to discern their meaning . ! lad he conjured up these rescuers with his mental broadcast , then ? Angels , were they ? Spirits ? Valentine settled back , hardly caring , totallyspent . He thought hazily of drawing Lisamon Hultin aside and telling her to make no mention of his true identity , but he lacked even the energy for that , and hoped she would have sense enough not to compound absurdity with absurdity by saying any such thing . " Ile is Coronal of Majipoor in disguise , yes , and the dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , and  --  " Yes . Certainly that would have the ring of unanswerable truth to these people . Valentinesmiled faintly and drifted into a dreamless sleep . When he woke he was in a pleasant sunlit room , facing out on n broad golden Izeach , and Carabella was looking down at him with an expression of grave concern . " My lord ? " she said softly . " Do you hear me ? " " Is this a dream ? " " This is the island of Mardigile in the Archipelago , " she told him . " You were picked up yesterday , drifting in the ocean , along with the giantess . These islanders are fisherfolk , who have been scouting thesea for survivors since the ship went down . " " Who else lives ? " Valentine asked quickly . " Deliamber and Zalzan Kavol are here with me . The Mardigile folk say that Khun , Shanamir , Vinorkis , and some Skandars  --  I do n't know if ' they 're ours  --  were picked up by boats from a neighboring inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have reached the islands too . " " And Sleet ' ? What of Sleet ' ? "  |p240Carabella  showed , for a flashing moment , a look of fear . " I have no news of Sleet , " she said . " But the rescue is continuing . He may be safe on one of these islands . There are dozens hereabouts . The Divine has preserved us so far : we will not be cast aside now . " She laughed lightly . " Lisamon Hultin has told a wonderful story of how you both were swallowed by the great dragon , and hacked your way out with the vibration-sword . The islanders love it . They think it 's the most splendid fable since the tale of Lord Stiamot and the  --  " " It happened , " Valentine said . " My lord ? " " The dragon . Swallowing us . She tells the truth . " Carabella giggled . " When I first learned in dreams of your real self , I believed that . But when you tell me  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were great pillars holding up the vault of the stomach , and an opening at one end through which sea-water came rushing every few minutes , and with it came fish that were pushed by little whips toward a greenish pond where they were digested , and where the giantess and I would have been digested too , if we were less lucky . Did she tell you that ? And do you think we spent our time out there inventing a fable to amuse you all ? " Eyes wide , Carabella said , " She told the same story , yes . But we thought  --  " " It 's true , Carabella . " " Then it is a miracle of the Divine , and you will be famous in all time to come ! " " I 'm already going to be famous , " said Valentine acidly , " as the Coronal who lost his throne , and took up juggling for lack of a royal occupation . That will win me a place in the ballads alongside the Pontifex Arioc , who made himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only embellishes the legend I 'm creating around myself . " His expression changed suddenly . " You 've told none of these people who I am , I hope ? " " Not a word , my lord . " " Good . Keep it that way . They have enough difficult things to believe about us , as it is . " An islander , slim and tanned and with the great sweep of fair hair that seemed the universal style here , brought Valentine a tray of food : some clear soup , a tender piece of baked fish , triangular wedges of a fruit with dark indigo flesh dotted with tiny scarlet seeds . Valen tine found himself ravenously hungry . Afterward he strolled with Carabella on the beach outside hisp241cottage . " Once again I thought you were lost to me forever , " he said softly . " I thought I would never hear your voice again . " " Do I matter that much to you , my lord ? " " More than I could ever tell you . " She smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For so I call you , Valentine , but you are Lord Valentine , and how many fancy women do you have , Lord Valentine , waiting for you on Castle Mount ? " He had now and then been thinking the same thing himself . Had he a lover there ? Many of them ? An intended bride , even ? So much of his past was still shrouded . And if he reached the Castle , and if a woman who had waited for him came forth to him " No , " he said . " You are mine , Carabella , and I am yours , and whatever may have been in the past  --  if ever anything was  --  lies in the past now . I have a different face these days . I have a different soul . " She looked skeptical , but did not challenge what he had said , and he lightly kissed her frown away . " Sing to me , " he said . " The song you sang under the bush in i'idruid , the festival-night . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is worth my love to me . Eh ? " " I know another much like it , " she said , and took up the pocketharpfrom her hip : My love has donned a pilgrim 's robe Afar across the seaMy love has gone to the Isle of Sleep Across the dreaming sea . Sweet my love , and fair as dawn Afar across the seaLost my love to an island tall Across the dreaming sea . Lady kind of the distant IsleAfar across the seaFill my dreams with my lover 's smile Across the dreaming sea . " A different sort of song , that one , " Valentine said . " A sadder un+ . Sing me that other , love . " " Another time . " " Please . This is a time of joy , of reuniting , Carabella . Please . " She smiled and sighed and took up the harp again.  |p242My  love is fair as is the spring , As gentle as the night , My love is sweet as stolen fruitYes , he thought . Yes , that one was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her neck , and stroked it as they walked along the beach . It was astonishingly beautiful here , warm and peaceful . Birds of fifty hues perched in the tortuous-limbed little trees of the shore , and a crystalline sea , surfless , transparent , lapped at the fine sand . The air was soft and mild , fragrant with the perfumes of unknownblossoms . From far away came the sound of laughter and of a gay , bright , tinkling music . How tempting it was , Valentine thought , to abandon all fantasies of Castle Mount and settle forever on Mardigile , and go out at dawn on a fishing-boat for the catch , and spend the rest of each day frolicking in the hot sunshine . But there would be no such abdications for him . In the afternoon Zalzan Kavol and Autifon Deliamber , both healthy and well rested after their ordeals at sea , came to call on him , and soon they were talking of ways and means to continue the journey . Zalzan Kavol , parsimonious as always , had had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so at least half their treasury had survived , even if Shanamir had lost the rest . The Skandar laid out the glittering coins . " With this , " he said , " we can hire these fisherfolk to convey us to the Isle . I have spoken with our hosts . This Archipelago is nine hundred miles in length , and numbers three thousandislands , more than eight hundred of them inhabited . No one here wishes to journey all the way to the Isle , but for a few royals we can hire a large trimaran that will carry us to Rodamaunt Graun , near the mid-point of the chain , and there we can probably find transportthe rest of the way . " " When can we leave ? " Valentine asked . " As soon , " said Deliamber , " as we are reunited once more . I am told that several of our people are on their way across from the nearby isle of Burbont at this moment . " " Which ones ? " " Khun , Vinorkis , and Shanamir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rovorn . With them is Captain Gorzval . Gibor Haern is lost at sea  --  I saw him perish , struck by a timber and sen t under  --  and of Sleet there is no news . " Valentine touched the Skandar 's shaggy forearm . " I grieve for your latest loss . " Zalzan Kavol 's feelings seemed well under control . " Let us rather rejoice that some of us still live , my lord , " he said quietly.  |p243In  early afternoon a boat from Burbont brought the other survivors . There were embraces all around ; and then Valentine turned to Gorzval , who stood apart , looking numb and bewildered , rubbing at the stump of his severed arm . The dragon-captain seemed in shock . Valentine would have put his arms around the hapless man , but the instant he approached , Gorzval sank to his knees in the sand and touched his forehead to the ground and stayed there , trembling , arms outspread in the starburst gesture . " My lord  --  " he whispered harshly . " My lord  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been talking ? " Silence a moment . Then Shanamir , a bit frightened , said , " I , my lord . I meant no harm . The Skandar seemed so injured by the loss of his ship  --  I thought to console him by telling him who his passenger had been , that he had become part of the history of Majipoor by giving you voyage . This was before we knew that you had survived the wreck . " The boy 's lip quivered . " My lord , I meant no harm by it ! " Valentine nodded . " And no harm was done . I forgive you . Gorz-val ? " The cowering dragon-captain remained huddled at Valentine 's feet . " Look up , Gorzval . I ca n't talk to you this way . " " My lord ? " " Get to your feet . " " My lord  --  " " Please , Gorzval . Get up ! " The Skandar , amazed , peered at Valentine and said , " Please , you say ? Please ? " Valentine laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . A 1 I right : Up ! I command it ! " Shakily Gorzval rose . He was a miserable sight , this little threeurrnedSkandar , his fur matted , sandy , his eyes bloodshot , his expressiondowncast . Valentine said , " I brought foul luck upon you , and you had no need of more of that . Accept my apologies ; and if fortune begins to smile more kindly on me , I will repair the harm you have suffered , someday . I promise you that . What will you do now ? Gather your crew and return to Piliplok ? " Gorzval shook his head pathetically . " I could never go there again . I have no ship , I have no reputation , I have no money . I have lost everything and it can never be regained . My people were released of their indentures when the Brangalyn sank . I am alone now . I am ruined , ,  | " Come with us to the Isle of the Lady , then , Gorzval . " " My lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think these islanders prefer not to take in settlers , and this is no climate for a Skandar , anyway . Nor can a dragon-hunter become a fisherman , I think , without knowing pain every time he casts his nets . Come with us . If we get no farther than the Isle , you may find peace there in the service of the Lady ; and if we continue on our quest , there will be honor for you as we make the ascent of Castle Mount . What do you say , Gorzval ? " " It frightens me to be near you , my lord . " " Am I so terrifying ? Do I have a dragon 's mouth ? Do you see these people green-faced with fear ? " Valentine clapped the Skandar on his shoulder . To Zalzan Kavol he said , " No one can replace the brothers you have lost . But at least I give you another companion of your own kind . And now let 's make arrangements for departure , eh ? The Isle is still many days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured an island craft to carry them eastward in the morning . That evening the hospitable islanders provided them with a splendid feast , cool green wines and sleek sweet fruits and fine fresh sea-dragon flesh . That last made Valentine queasy , and he would have pushed it away , but he saw Lisamon Hultin shovelingit in as though it were the last meal she would eat . As an exercise in self-discipline he decided to force a morsel into his own throat , and found the flavor so irresistible that he renounced on the spot any discomfort that sea-dragons might arouse in his mind . As they ate , sunset came , at an early hour here in the tropics , and an extraordinaryone it was , streaking the sky with rich throbbing tones of amber and violet and magenta and gold . Surely these were blessed islands , Valentine thought , extraordinarily joyous places even on a world where most places were happy ones and most lives fulfilled . The populationseemed generally homogeneous , handsome long-legged folk of human blood with thick unshorn golden hair and smooth honey-coloredskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghayrogs among them , and Deliamber said that other islands in the chain had people of different stocks . According to Deliamber , who had been minglingfreely since his rescue , the islands were largely out of touch with the mainland continents , and went their way in a world of their own , ignorant of matters of high destiny in the greater world . When Valentine asked one of his hosts if Lord Valentine the Coronal had happened to pass this way on his recent journey to Zimroel , the woman gave him a blank look and said ingenuously , " Is the Coronal not Lord Voriax ? "  | " Dead two years or more , I hear , " one of the other islanders declared , and it seemed to come as news to most of the people at the table . Valentine shared his cottage with Carabella that night . They stood together a long while on the veranda , eyes fixed on the brilliant white track of moonlight gleaming out across the sea toward distant Piliplok . He thought of the sea-dragons grazing in that sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that dreamlike sojourn , and , with pain , of his two lost comrades , Gibor Haern and Sleet , one of whom was deep in the sea now , the other perhaps . So great a journey , he thought , remembering Pidruid , Dulorn , Mazadone , Ilirivoyne , Ni-moya , remembering the flight through the forest , the turbulence of the Steiche , the coldness of the Piliplok dragon-captains , the look of the dragon as it bore down on poor Gorzval 's doomed vessel . So great a journey , so many thousands of miles , and so many miles yet to cover before he could begin to answer the questions that flooded his soul . Carabella nestled close beside him , silent . Her attitude toward him was constantly evolving , and now had become a mixture of awe and love , of deference and irreverence , for she accepted and respected him as true Coronal , and yet remembered his innocence , his ignorance , his naivete , qualities which had not yet left him even now . And clearly she feared she would lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simply on the level of dealing daily with the world , she was far more competent than he , far more experienced , and that colored her view of him , making her see him as terrifying and childlike both at once . He understood that and took no issue with it , for , although fragments of ' his earlier self and princely education returned to him almost daily , and he grew daily more accustomed to the postures of command , most of his former identity still was inaccessible to him and he was , in large part , still Valentine the easy-going wanderer , Valentine the innocent , Valentine the juggler . That darker figure , the Lord Valentine he once had been , that he might someday be again , was a hidden substratum in his spirit , rarely operative but never to be ignored . He thought Carabella was making the best of a difficult position . She said at last , " What are you thinking of , Valentine ? " " Sleet . I miss that tough little man . " " He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " I hope so . " Valentine cupped his arm about her shoulders . " I think also of all that has happened , and all that will happen . I move as though through a world of dreams , Carabella . " " Who can tell , really , what is the dream and what is not ? We move as the Divine instructs us , and we ask no questions , becausep246there are no answers . Do you know what I mean ? There are questions and there are answers , of course . I can tell you what day this is , and what we had for dinner , and how this island is called , if you ask me , but there are no questions , there are no answers . " " So I believe also , " Valentine said . Zalzan Kavol had hired one of the grandest fishing-boats on the island , a marvelous turquoise trimaran named Pride of Mardigile . It was a splendid fifty-footer rising nobly on its three sleek hulls , and its sails , spotless and dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the craft a festive , jubilant air . Their captain was a man past middle years , one of the most prosperous fishermen of the island , Grigitor by name , tall and sturdy , with hair down to his waist and skin so vigorous it looked to have been oiled ; he was one of those who had rescued Deliamber and Zalzan Kavol , when the first alarms of a sinking ship had reached the island . He had a crew of five , his sons and daughters , all strapping and handsome after his image . The route of the voyage lay first toward Burbont , less than half an hour 's sail away , and then into an open channel of shallow greenish water that linked the two outermost islands to the rest . The sea-bottom here was of clean white sand , and sunlight penetrated easily to it , setting off patterns of sparkling coruscations that revealed the underseadwellers , the rip-toads and the twitch-crabs and the big-leg lobsters , and the gaudy-hued multitudes of fish , and the sinister , lurking sandeels . Once even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land for its own good and obviously confused ; one of Grigitor 's daughters urged that they go after it , but he shook the notion off , saying that their responsibility was to get their passengers swiftly to Rodamaunt Graun . All morning they sailed , passing three more islands  --  Richelure , Grialon , Voniaire , said their captain  --  and at noon they dropped anchorfor lunch . Two of Grigitor 's children went over the side to hunt , moving like magnificent animals , naked in the brilliant water , quickly spearing crustaceans and fish with rarely a missed thrust . Grigitor himself prepared the meal , cubes of raw white flesh marinated in a spicy sauce and washed down with cheering pungent green wine . Deli/amber withdrew after eating only a little , and perched himself on the tip of one of the outer hulls , staring intently to the north . After a while Valentine noticed , and would have gone to him , but Carabella caught him by the wrist . " He is in trance , " she said . " Let him be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , until the little Vroon descended from his place and rejoined them . The wizard looked pleased . " I have cast my mind forth , " he announced , " and I bring you good news . Sleet lives ! " " Good news indeed ! " Valentine cried . " Where is he ? " " An island in that group , " said Deliamber , gesturing vaguely with a cluster of tentacles . " He is with several of Gorzval 's people who escaped by boat from the disaster . " Grigitor said , " Tell me which island , and we 'll make for it . " " It has the shape of a circle , with an opening at one side , and a body of water at its center . The people are dark-skinned and wear their hair in long ringlets , with jewels in their earlobes . " " Kangrisorn , " said one of Grigitor 's daughters instantly . Her father nodded . " Kangrisorn it is , " he said . " Pull up anchor ! " Kangrisorn lay an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charted . It was one of half a dozen small sandy atolls , mere rings of upraised reef surrounding little lagoons , and it must have been uncommon for people of Mardigile to visit it , for long before the trimaran had entered the harbor children of Kangrisorn were flocking out in boats to view the strangers . They were as dark as the Mardigilese were golden , and just as beautiful in their solemn way , with shinipg white teeth and hair so black it seemed almost blue . With much laughter and waving of arms they guided the trimaranthrough the entrance to the lagoon , and there , squatting at the edge of the water , was Sleet indeed , looking sunburned and a bit ragged but mainly intact . He was juggling five or six globes of bleached white coral for an audience that consisted of a few dozen islanders and five members of Gorzval 's crew , four humans and a Hjort . Gorzval seemed apprehensive at encountering his erstwhile employees. , He had begun to recover his spirits during the morning 's voyage , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagoon . Carabella was the first off , splashing through the shallow water to embrace Sleet ; Valentine followed close behind . Gorzval lurked to the rear , eyes lowered.  | " How did you find us ? " Sleet asked . Valentine indicated Deliamber . " Sorcery . How else ? Are you well ? " " I thought I 'd die of seasickness getting here , but I 've had a day or two to recover . " With a shudder he said , " And you ? I saw you sucked under , and believed all was over . " " So it seemed , " said Valentine . " A strange story , which I 'll tell you another time . We are all together again , eh , Sleet ? All but Gibor Haern , " he added mournfully , " who perished in the wreck . But we 've taken on Gorzval as one of our companions . Come forward , Gorzval ! Are n't you pleased to see your men again ? " Gorzval muttered something indistinct and looked between Valentineand the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned to the crew people , meaning to ask them to hold no ill will toward the former captain for a disaster far beyond mortal control . He was taken aback to discover the five of them grovelingat his feet . Sleet said , abashed , " I thought you were dead , my lord . I could n't resist telling them my tale . " " I see , " said Valentine , " that the news is apt to spread more rapidly than I wish , no matter how solemnly I swear you all to silence . Well , it 's pardonable , Sleet . " To the others he said , " Up . Up . This crawling in the sand does none of us any good . " They rose . Their contempt for Gorzval was impossible for them to hide ; but it was overshadowed by the astonishment they felt at being in the presence of the Coronal . Of the five , Valentine quickly learned , two  --  the Hjort and one of the humans  --  chose to remain on Kangrisorn in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piliplok and resume their trade . The other three begged to accompany him on his pilgrimage . The new members of the rapidly expanding band were two women  --  Pandelon and Cordeine , a carpenter and a sailmender  --  and a man , Thesme , one of the winchwinders . Valentine bade them be welcome , and accepted pledges of allegiance from them , a ceremony that stirred vague discomfort in him . Yet he was growing accustomed to taking on these trappings of rank . Grigitor and his children had paid no attention to the kneelings and hand-kissings among the passengers . Just as well : until he had conferred with the Lady , Valentine wished not to spread news across the world of his return to self-awareness . He was still uncertain of his strategy and unsure of his powers . Besides , if he advertised his existence he might draw the attention of the present Coronal , whop249was not likely to stay his hand if he discovered that a pretender was journeying toward Castle Mount . The trimaran resumed its voyage . From isle to golden isle it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venturinginto deeper , bluer waters . Past Lormanar and Climidole they mailed , and Secundail , Blayhar Strand , Garhuven , and Wiswis Keep ; past Quile and Fruil ; past Dawnbreak , Nissemhold , and Thiaquil ; past Roazen and Piplinat ; and past the great crescent sand-spit known as Damozal . They stopped at the island of Sungyve for fresh water , at Musorn for fruit and leafy vegetables , at Cadibyre for casks of the young pink wine of that island . And after many days of traveling through these small sun-blessed places they pulled into the spacious harbor of Rodamaunt Graun . This was a large lush island of mountainous origin , surrounded by black volcanic beaches and equipped along its southern shore with a splendid natural breakwater . Rodamaunt Graun was dominant in the Archipelago , by far the largest in the chain , with a population , so Grigitor asserted , of five and a half million . Twin cities spread out , like wings from both sides of the harbor , but the flanks of the island 's looming central peak were also well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in neat ranks almost to mid-point . About the last line of houses the slopes were thickly covered with jungle , and at the highest level rose a plume of thin white smoke , for Rodamaunt Graun was an active volcano . The last eruption , said Grigitor , had occurred less than fifty years before . But that was hard to believe , when one looked at the impeccable houses and the unbroken forest growth above them . Here the Pride of Mardigile would turn back for home , but Grigitorarranged for the voyagers to shift to a trimaran even more noble , he Rodamaunt Queen , which would carry them to the Isle of Sleep . Her skipper was one Namurinta , a woman of regal poise and bearing , with long straight hair as white as Sleet 's and a youthful , unlined face . Her manner was fastidious and quizzical : she studied her assortment of passengers closely , as if trying to determine what pull had drawn such a mixture into an off-season pilgrimage , but she said only , " If you are refused at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there will be extra costs for your upkeep in that event . " " Does the Isle often refuse pilgrims ? " Valentine asked . Not when they come at the proper time . But the pilgrim-ships , as I suppose you know , do n't sail in autumn . There may not be facilities ready for receiving you . " " We 've come this far with only minor difficulties , " said Valentinep250jauntily . He heard Carabella snicker and Sleet make stagy coughing sounds . " I feel confident , " he went on , " that we 'll meet no obstacles greater than those we 've already encountered . " " I admire your determination , " Namurinta said , and signaled to her crew to prepare for departure . The Archipelago in its eastern half hooked somewhat to the north , and the islands here were generally unlike Mardigile and its neighbors , being mainly the tops of a submerged mountain chain , not flat coralbasedplatforms . Studying Namurinta 's charts , Valentine concluded that this part of the Archipelago had once been a long tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isle of Sleep , but had been swallowed by some rising of the Inner Sea in ancient times . Only the tallest peaks had remained above water ; and between the easternmost island of the Archipelago and the coast of the Isle there now lay some hundreds of miles of open sea  --  a formidable journey for a trimaran , even so well equipped a trimaran as Namurinta 's . But the voyage was uneventful . They stopped at four ports  --  Hellirache , Sempifiore , Dimmid , and Guadeloom  --  for water and victuals , sailed on serenely past Rodamaunt Ounze , the last island of the Archipelago , and entered Ungehoyer Channel , which separated the Archipelagofrom the Isle of Sleep . This was a broad but shallow seaway , richly endowed with marine life and heavily fished by the island folk , all but the easternmost hundred miles , which formed part of the holy perimeter of the Isle . In these waters were monsters of a harmless kind , great balloon-shaped creatures known as volevants that anchored themselves to deep rocks and lived by filtering plankton through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrient matter , which sustained the enormous population of life-forms about them . Valentine saw dozens of volevants in the next few days : swollen globularsacks of a deep carmine hue , fifty to eighty feet across at their upper ends , plainly visible just a few feet below the calm surface . They bore dark semicircular markings on their skins , which Valentine imagined were eyes and noses and lips , so that he saw faces peering gravely up from the water , and it seemed to him that the volevants were beings of the deepest melancholy , philosophers of weight and wisdom reflecting eternally on the ebb and flow of the tides . " They sadden me , " he told Carabella . " Forever hovering there , tied by their tails to hidden boulders , swaying slowly as the currents move them . How thoughtful they are ! " " Thoughtful ! Primitive gasbags , no cleverer than a sponge ! " " But look carefully at them , Carabella . They want to fly , to soar  --  they look up at the sky , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but all they can do is hang below the waves , and sway , and fill themselves with invisible organisms . Just in front of their faces lies another world , and it would be death to them to enter it . Are you untouched by that ? " " Silly , " Carabella said . On the second day in the channel the Rodamaunt Queen came upon five fishing-boats that had uprooted a volevant , brought it to the surface , and slit it into gores ; they clustered about the huge outspreadskin of it , cutting it into smaller sections and stacking them like hides on their decks . Valentine was appalled . When I am Coronal again , he thought , I will prohibit the killing of these creatures , and then he looked at the thought in amazement , asking himself if it was his intention to promulgate laws on the basis of sympathies alone , without study of the facts . He asked Namurinta what use was made of volevant-skin . " Medicinal , " she replied . " For the comfort of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them provides enough of the drug for all the islands for a year or more : what you see is a rare event . " When I am Coronal again , Valentine resolved , I will reserve judgmentuntil I am in full possession of the truth , if such a thing is ever possible . Nevertheless , the imagined solemn profundity of the volevants haunted him with strange emotions , and he was relieved to pass beyond their zone , and into the cool blue waters that bordered the Isle of Sleep . The Isle now lay clearly in view to the east , growing perceptibly larger every hour . Valentine had seen it only in dreams and fantasies , and those based on nothing but his own imaginings and whatever residue of remembered reality still encrusted his mind ; and he was not at all prepared for the actuality of the place . It was immense . That should not have been surprising on a planet itself gigantic , and where so many things were in a scale with the planetary dimensions . But Valentine had misled himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mcope. 1 le had expected something perhaps two or three times as big as Rodamaunt Graun , which was foolishness : the Isle of Sleep , he Now now , spanned the entire horizon and looked as large from thisp252distance as had the coast of Zimroel when they were a day or two out of Piliplok . An island it was , but by that token so too were Zimroel and Alhanroel and Suvrael ; and the only reason the Isle was not called a continent , as were they , was that they were colossal , and the Isle merely very big . And the Isle was dazzling . Like the promontory across the mouth of the river from Piliplok , it was ramparted by cliffs of pure white chalk that blazed brilliantly in the afternoon sunlight . They formed a wall hundreds of feet high and perhaps hundreds of miles in length across the western face of the Isle . Atop that wall spread a darkgreencrown of forest , and , so it seemed , there was a second wall of chalk inland at a higher elevation , topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sea , so that the Isle from this side gave an appearance of tier upon tier of brightness , rising to some unknown and perhaps inaccessible central fastness . He had heard of the terraces of the Isle , which he gathered were artificial constructs of great age , symbolic markers of the ascent toward initiation . But the island itself seemed a place of terraces , natural ones , that enhanced its mystery . Small wonder that this place had become the abode of the sacred on Majipoor . Namurinta said , pointing , " That notch in the cliff is Taleis , where the pilgrim-ships land . It 's one of the Isle 's two harbors ; the other 's Numinor , over around Alhanroel side . But you must know all this , being pilgrims . " " We have had little time to study , " said Valentine . " This pilgrimagecame on us suddenly . " " Will you pass the rest of your lives here in the service of the Lady ? " she asked . " In the service of the Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think not here . The Isle is only a way-station for some of us , on a much greater journey . " Namurinta looked puzzled at that , but she asked no further questions . The wind blew briskly from the southwest here , and carried the Rodamaunt Queen easily and swiftly toward Taleis . Soon the great chalk wall altogether filled the view , and the opening in it was revealed as no mere notch , but a harbor of heroic size , a huge gouge in the whiteness . With sails full , the trimaran entered . Valentine , in the bow , hair streaming in the breeze , was awestruck by the scope of the place , for within the sharp-angled V that was Taleis the cliffs descended almost vertically toward the water from a height of a mile or more , and at their base was a flat strip of land bordered by ap253broad white beach . At one side were wharfs and piers and docks , everythingdwarfed by the scale of this gigantic amphitheater . It was hard to imagine how one could get from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the island : the place was a natural fortress . And it was silent . There were no vessels in the harbor and an eerie echoing quietness prevailed , against which the sound of the wind or the screeching of an occasional gull took on magnified significance . " Is there anyone here ? " Sleet asked . " Who will greet us ? " Carabella closed her eyes . " To have to go around to the Numinor side now  --  worse , to return to the Archipelago  --  " " No , " Deliamber said . " We will be met . Fear nothing . " The trimaran glided toward the shore and came to rest at a vacant pier . The grandeur of the surroundings was overwhelming here , deep in the V of the harbor , with the cliffs rising so high they seemed to be on the verge of toppling . A crewman made the boat fast and they stepped forth . Deliamber 's confidence seemed misplaced . There was no one here . Everything remained still , a silence so mighty that Valentine wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . They waited . They exchanged uncertain glances . " Let 's explore , " he said finally . " Lisamon , Khun , Zalzan Kavolexaminethe buildings to our left . Sleet , Deliamber , Vinorkis , Shanamir  --  downthat way . You , Pandelon , Thesme , Rovorn  --  to that curve of the beach , and look beyond it . Gorzval , Erfon  --  " Valentine , with Carabella and the sailmender Cordeine , went straight ahead , to the foot of the titanic chalk cliff . Some sort of pathwaybegan there , and angled upward at an impossible slope , close to vertical , toward the upper reaches of the cliff , where it vanished between two white spires . Climbing that path would require the agility of a forest-brother and the gall of a tandy-prancer , Valentine decided . Yet no other place of exit from the beach was apparent . He peered into the small wooden shack at the base of the path and found nothing hut a few floater-sleds , presumably used in riding the path . He hauled one out , set it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut he saw no way of activating it . Baffled , he returned to the pier . Most of the others had come hack already . " The place is deserted , " said Sleet . Valentine looked toward Namurinta . " How long would it take you to carry us around to the Alhanroel side ? " " To Numinor ? Weeks . But I would not go there . " " We have money , " said Zalzan Kavol . She looked indifferent . " My trade is fishing . The time of harvestp254for the thorn-fish is at hand . If I take you to Numinor , I will miss it , and half the gissoon season as well . You could not recompense me for that . " The Skandar produced a five-royal piece , as though by its glitter alone he could change the captain 's mind . But she shook it away . " For half of what you paid me to bring you from Rodamaunt Graun to here , I 'll return you to Rodamaunt Graun , but that 's the best I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sailing again and this harbor will come to life , and then , if you wish , I 'll bring you here again for the same half fee . However you decide , I am at your service . But I will sail from this place before it grows dark , and not for Numinor . " Valentine considered the situation . This was a greater nuisance than being swallowed by the sea-dragon ; for he had quickly enough been set free from that , but this unexpected obstacle threatened to delay him well into winter , or even beyond , and all this while Dominin Barjazid ruled at Castle Mount , new laws went forth , history was altered , the usurper consolidated his position . But what , then ? He glanced at Deliamber , but the wizard , though he looked bland and untroubled , offered no suggestions . They could not climb this wall . They could not fly it . They could not leap in mighty bounds to the unreachable , infinitely desirable forest groves that cloaked its shoulders . Back to Rodamaunt Graun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ? " Valentine asked . " For an additional fee , that is ? Possibly in the morning we 'll find someone who  --  " " I am far from Rodamaunt Graun , " Namurinta replied . " I yearn to see its shores again . Waiting here another hour , even , would gain you nothing and me even less . The season is wrong ; the people of the Lady expect no one to arrive at Taleis , and will not be here . " Shanamir tugged lightly at Valentine 's sleeve . " You are Coronal of Majipoor , " the boy whispered . " Command her to wait ! Reveal yourselfand force her to her knees ! " Smiling , Valentine said softly , " I think the trick might not work . I 've left my crown elsewhere . " " Then have Deliamber witch her into yielding ! " That was a possibility . But Valentine disliked it : Namurinta had taken them on in good faith , and by rights was free to leave , and probably was correct that waiting here another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield by Deliamber 's powers was distasteful to him . On the other hand " Lord Valentine ! " a woman 's voice called , far away . " Here ! Come ! "  |p255He  looked toward the far end of the harbor . It was Pandelon , Gorzval 's carpenter , who had gone with Thesme and Rovorn to inspect what lay around the curve . She was waving , beckoning . He sprinted down toward her , the others following after a moment . When he reached her she led him through the shallow water around a jutting fold of rock that concealed a much smaller beach . There he saw a single-story structure of pink sandstone that bore the triangle-within-triangle emblem of the Lady and was perhaps some sort of shrine . In front of it was a garden of flowering shrubs arranged in symmetrical patterns of red , blue , orange , and yellow blossoms . Two gardeners , a man and a woman , were tending it . They looked up without interest as Valentine approached . Awkwardly he made the sign of the Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " We are pilgrims , and need to be told the way to the terraces . " " You come out of season , " the woman said . Her face was wide and pale , with a sprinkling of pale freckles on it . There was nothing friendly in her voice . " Because of our eagerness to enter into the Lady 's service . " The woman shrugged and returned to her weeding . The man , a thick-muscled , short-statured person with thinning gray hair , said , " You should have gone to Numinor at this time of year . " " We came from Zimroel . " That produced a minor flicker of attention . " Through the dragonwinds ? You must have had a difficult crossing . " " There were some troublesome moments , " Valentine said , " but they lie behind us now . We feel only joy at having reached this Isle at last . " " The Lady will comfort you , " said the man indifferently , and he began to work with a pruning-shears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine said , " And the way to the terraces ? " The freckled woman said , " You wo n't be able to operate it . " " But will you help us ? " Silence again . Valentine said , " It would be only a moment , and then we 'd disturb you no more . Show us the way . " " We have our duties here , " said the balding man . Valentine moistened his lips . This was leading nowhere ; and for all he knew , Namurinta had left the other beach five minutes ago ii0d was on her way back to Rodamaunt Graun , marooning them . He looked to Deliamber . Some wizardly compulsion might be in order.  |p256Deliamber  ignored the hint . Valentine moved toward him and murmured , " Touch your tentacles to them and inspire them to cooperate . " " I think my sorceries are of little value on this holy Isle , " said Deliamber . " Try wizardries of your own . " " I have none ! " " Try , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Coronal of Majipoor , he told himself , and I am the son of the Lady whom these two worship and serve . It was impossible to say any of that to the gardeners , but he could transmit it , perhaps , through sheer force of soul . He stood tall and moved toward the center of his being , as he would have done if he were preparing to juggle before the most critical of audiences , and he smiled a smile so warm it might have opened buds on the branches of the flowering shrubs , and after a moment the gardeners , looking up from their work , saw it and showed an unmistakable response , a reaction of surprise , bewilderment , and  --  submission . He bathed them in glowing love . " We have come thousands of miles , " he said gently , " to give ourselves up to the peace of the Lady , and we beg you , in the name of the Divine that we both serve , to assist us on our pathway ; for our need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked , as if the sun had emerged from behind a gray cloud . " We have our tasks , " said the woman lamely . " We are not supposed to ascend until the garden is cared for , " the man said , almost in a mumble . " The garden thrives , " said Valentine , " and will thrive without your aid for a few hours today . Help us , before the darkness comes . We ask only that you point us on our way , and I tell you that the Lady will reward you for it . " The gardeners looked troubled . They glanced at one another , and then toward the sky , as though to see how late it was . Frowning , they rose and brushed the sandy soil from their knees , and , like sleepwalkers , moved to the water 's edge , and out into the light surf , and around the point to the greater beach , and down toward the foot of the cliff where that vertical path began its skyward climb . Namurinta was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Valentine went to her . " For your aid we thank you deeply , " he said . " You are staying ? " " We have found a way to the terraces . " She smiled in unfeigned pleasure . " I was not eager to abandonp257you , but Rodamaunt Graun was calling me . I wish you well as you make your pilgrimage . " " And I wish you a safe voyage home . " He turned away . " One thing , " the captain said . " Yes ? " " When the woman called to you from down there , " she said , " she hailed you as Lord Valentine . What was the meaning of that ? " " A joke , " said Valentine . " Only a joke . " " Lord Valentine is how the new Coronal is named , so I have been told , the one that rules since a year or two past . " " Yes , " Valentine said . " But he is a dark-haired man . It was only a joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A safe journey , Namu-rinta . " " A fruitful pilgrimage , Valentine . " He walked toward the cliff ' . The gardeners had taken several of the floater-sleds from the shack , and had placed them in riding sequenceon the thrusting-pad . Silently they gestured the travelers aboard . Valentine mounted the first sled , with Carabella , Deliamber , Shanamir , and Khun . The female gardener went into the shack , where , it seemed , the controls of the floaters must be located , for an instant afterward the sled drifted free of the pad and began the dizzying , terrifying ascent of the towering white cliff . " You have come , " said the acolyte Talinot Esulde , " to the Terrace of Assessment . Here you will be weighed in the balance . When it is time to move onward , your path takes you to the Terrace of Inception , and then to the Terrace of Mirrors , where you will confront yourself . It what you see is satisfactory to you and to your guides , you move in ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And so you proceed until the Terrace of Adoration . There , if the favor of the Lady is upon you , you will receive your summons to Inner Temple . But I would not expect that to happen quickly . I would not expect that to happen at all . Those who expect to attain the Lady are the least likely to reach her . " Valentine 's mood darkened at that , for not only did he expect to attain the Lady , it was absolutely vital that he do so ; and yet hep258understood what the acolyte was saying . In this holy place one made no demands on the fabric of existence . One surrendered ; one gave up demands and needs and desires ; one yielded , if one hoped to find peace . This was no place for a Coronal . The essence of a Coronal 's being was the wielding of power , wisely if he was capable of wisdom , but in any event steadfastly ; the essence of a pilgrim was surrender . In that contradiction he might easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Lady . He had , at least , reached the outer fringes of the Lady 's domain . At the top of the cliff they had been greeted by unsurprised acolytes , plainly aware that out-of-season pilgrims were floating toward them . And now , looking pious and faintly absurd in the soft pale robes of pilgrims , they were gathered in a low long building of smooth pink stone near the crest of the cliff . Flags of the same pink stone formed a massive semicircular promenade that stretched for what appeared to be a great distance along the edge of the forest that topped the cliff : this was the Terrace of Assessment . Beyond it lay more forest ; the other terraces were farther beyond ; and deeper in , not visible from where they were now , rose the second chalk cliff atop the plateau that the outer one formed . A third cliff yet , Valentine knew , rose above the second somewhere hundreds of miles inland , and this was the holiest precinct , where Inner Temple was , where the Lady dwelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed impossible that he would ever complete those last hundreds of miles . Night was falling swiftly . He could look back through the circular window behind him and see the darkening sky and the broad dark bosom of the sea , lit only by the purpling light of the vanishing sun as it fled toward Piliplok . There was a speck out there , a scratch on the smooth surface of the water , that he thought and hoped was the trimaran Rodamaunt Queen , heading homeward , and out there too were the volevants dreaming their endless dream , and the sea-dragons making their way toward a greater sea , and beyond all that was Zimroel , its teeming cities , its forest preserves and parklands , its festivals , its billions of souls . There was much for him to look back on ; but now he must look forward . He stared intently at Talinot Esulde , their first guide in this place , a tall slender person with milk-white skin and a shaven skull , who might be of either sex . Male was Valentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoulders argued that , though not absolutely  --  but the delicacy of Talinot Esulde 's facial bones , notably the fragile curve of the light ridges above the strange blue eyes , argued otherwise . Talinot Esulde was explaining things : the daily routine of prayerp259and work and meditation , the system of dream-speaking , the arrangement of living-quarters , the dietary restrictions , which excluded all wines and certain spices , and much else . Valentine tried to master it all , but there were so many regulations and requirements and obligationsand customs that they tangled in his mind , and he ceased making the effort after a time , hoping that daily practice would instill the rules in him . As darkness came Talinot Esulde led them from the indoctrination hall , past the sparkling spring-fed rock pool where they had been bathed before being given their robes and where they would bathe twice each day until they left this terrace , and to the dining-hall , farther from the cliff 's rim . Here they were served a simple meal of soup and fish , flavorless and unappealing even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , in robes of light green . The hall , a large one , was only partly full  --  the hour for dining was almost past , Talinot Esulde pointed out . Valentine looked at his fellow pilgrims . They were of all sorts , perhaps half of human stock , but also a great many Vroons and Ghayrogs , a sprinkling of Skandars , some Liimen , some Hjorts though not very many , and , far across the way , a little insular Su-Suheris group . The net of the lady caught all the races of Majipoor , it would seem . All but one . " Do Metamorphs ever seek the Lady ? " Valentine asked . Talinot Esulde smiled seraphically . " If a Piurivar came to us , we would accept it . But they take no part in our rites . They live to t hemselves as though they were alone on all of Majipoor . " " Perhaps some have come here disguised in other forms , " Sleet suggested . " We would know that , " said Talinot Esulde calmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers , hardly bigger than closets , in a hivelike lodge . A couch , a sink , n place for clothes , and nothing more . Lisamon Hultin glowered at hers . " No wine , " she said , " and I give up my sword , and now I sleep in this box ? I think I 'm going to be a failure as a pilgrim , Valentine . " " Peace , and make the effort . We 'll travel through the Isle as Nwiftly as we can . " He entered his room , which was between the warrior-woman 's and Carabella 's . Immediately the lightglobe dimmed , and when he settled in on his couch he found himself disappearing instantly into sleep , though the hour was still early . As consciousness left him a new light glowed softly in his mind , and he beheld the Lady , the unmistakable , unquestionable Lady of the Isle . Valentine had seen her in dreams many times before since Pi/druid , the gentle eyes , the dark hair , the flower at her ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision more detailed , and he noticed the small lines in the corners of her eyes and the tiny green jewels set in her earlobes and the thin silver band that encircled her brow . In his dream he held his hands to her and said , " Mother , here I am . Call me to you , mother . " She smiled at him , but she made no answer . They were in a garden , with alabandinas in bloom all about them . She nipped at the plants with a small golden implement , clipping away flowerbuds so the remaining ones would yield larger blossoms . He stood beside her , waiting for her to turn to him , but the work of nipping went on and on , and finally she said , still not looking his way , " One must give constant attention to one 's task if it is to be done properly . " " Mother , I am Valentine your son ! " " See , each branch has five buds ? Let them be and they all will open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one here , and the blooms are glorious . " And as she spoke the buds unfurled , and the alabandinas filled the air with a fragrance so keen it stunned him , while the great yellow petals stretched forth like platters , revealing the black stamens and pistils within . She touched them lightly , sending a scattering of purple pollen into the air . And said , " You are who you are , and always will be . " The dream changed , then , with nothing of the Lady remaining in it , but only a bower of thorny bushes waving rigid arms at him , and moleeka-birds of colossal size strutting about , and other images , confused and ever-altering and telling him nothing that had coherent pattern . When he woke he was expected to report at once to his dreamspeaker , not Talinot Esulde but another acolyte of the guide level , this a person named Stauminaup , shaven also and also of ambiguous sex , but more likely than not a woman . These acolytes were of a mediumlevel of initiation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the needs of novices here . Dream-speaking on the Isle was nothing like that which he had experienced in Falkynkip with Tisana . There were no drugs , there was no lying-together of bodies . He merely came into the presence of the speaker and described his dream . Stauminaup listened impassively . Valentine suspected that the speaker had had access to his dream as he was experiencing it , and merely wanted to contrast Valentine'saccount of it with her own perceptions , to see what gulfs and contradictions might lie between . Therefore he presented the dream exactly as he recalled it , saying , as he had in sleep , " Mother , I amp261Valentine your son ! " and studying Stauminaup for a reaction to that . But he might as well have been studying the chalk face of the cliff . When he was done the speaker said , " And what color were the alabandina blooms ? " " Why , yellow , with black centers ! " " A lovely flower . In Zimroel the alabandinas are scarlet , and yellowat the center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no preference , " said Valentine . Stauminaup smiled . " The alabandinas of Alhanroel are yellow , with black centers . You may go now . " The speakings were much the same every day : a cryptic comment , or one that was perhaps not so cryptic , but lay open to varying interpretations , only no interpretations ever were offered . Stauminaup was like a repository for his dreams , absorbing them without providing counsel . Valentine became accustomed to that . He became accustomed , too , to the daily routines of labor . He worked in the garden two hours each morning , doing minor trimming and weeding and much turning of soil , and in the afternoons he was a mason , taking instruction in the art of pointing the flagstones of the terrace . There were long sessions of meditation in which he was given no guidance whatever , only sent off to his room to stare at the walls . He saw hardly anything of his companions of the journey , except when they bathed together , at mid-morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had little to say . It was easy to get into the rhythm of this place and cast aside all urgencies . The tropic air , the perfume of millions of blossoms , the gentle tone of everythirig that went on here , lulled and soothed like a warm bath . But Alhanroel lay thousands of miles to the east , and he was moving not an inch toward his goal so long as he remained at the Terrace of Assessment . Already a week had gone by . During his meditationsessions Valentine entertained fantasies of collecting his people and slipping away by night , passing illicitly through terrace after terrace , scaling Second Cliff and Third , presenting himself ultimately to the Lady at the threshold of her temple ; but he suspected they would not get far , in a place where dreams were open books . So he fretted . He knew that fretting would win him no advanceMerithere , and he taught himself instead to relax , to give himself tip utterly to his tasks , to clear his mind of all needs and compulsions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dream of summoningby which the Lady would beckon him inward . That had no effect either . He plucked weeds , he cultivated the warm rich soil , hep262carried buckets of mortar and grout to the farthest reaches of the terrace , he sat crosslegged in his meditation hours with his mind entirelyempty , and night after night he went to bed praying that the Lady would appear and tell him , " It is time for you to come to me , " but nothing happened . " How long will this continue ? " he asked Deliamber at the pool one day . " It 's the fifth week ! Or maybe the sixth  --  I 'm losing count . Do I stay here a year ? Two ? Five ? " " Some of the pilgrims among us have done just that , " said the Vroon . " I spoke with one , a Hjort who served in patrols under Lord Voriax . She has spent four years here and seems quite resigned to staying at the outermost terrace forever . " " She has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn , Deliamber . But I  --  " "  --  have urgent appointments to the east , " Deliamber said . " And therefore you are condemned to remain here . There 's a paradox in your dilemma , Valentine . You strive to renounce purpose ; but your renunciation itself has a purpose . Do you see ? Your speaker surely does . " " Of course I see . But what do I do ? How do I pretend not to care whether I stay here forever ? " " Pretense is impossible . The moment you genuinely do n't care , you 'll move onward . Not until then . " Valentine shook his head . " That 's like telling me that my salvationdepends on never thinking of gihorna-birds . The harder I 'd try not to think of them , the more flocks of gihornas would fly through my mind . What am I to do , Deliamber ? " But Deliamber had no other suggestions . The next day , Valentine learned that Shanamir and Vinorkis had received advancement to the Terrace of Inception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wizard remarked that Valentine did not look well ; and Valentine replied , with an impatience he could not control , " How do you expect me to look ? Do you know how many weeds I 've pulled , how much masonry I 've pointed , while in Alhanroel a Barjazid sits on Castle Mount and  --  " " Peace , " Deliamber said softly . " This is not like you . " " Peace ? Peace ? How long can I be peaceful ? " " Perhaps your patience is being tested . In which case , my lord , you are failing the test . " Valentine considered that . After a moment he said , " I admit yourp263logic . But perhaps it 's my ingenuity that 's being tested . Deliamber , put a summoning-dream into my head tonight . " " My sorceries , you know , seem of little value on this island . " " Do it . Try it . Concoct a message from the Lady and plant it in my mind , and then we 'll see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands for the moment of thought-transference . Valentine felt the faint distanttingle of contact . " Your sorceries still work , " he said . And that night there came to him a dream in which he drifted like a volevant in the bathing-pool , attached to the rocks by some membrane that had sprouted from his feet , and as he sought to free himself the face of the Lady appeared , smiling , in the night sky , and whispered to him , " Come , Valentine , come to me , come , " and the membrane dissolved , and he floated upward and soared on the breeze , borne by the wind toward Inner Temple . Valentine relayed the dream to Stauminaup in his dream-speakingsession . She listened as though he were telling her of a dream of plucking weeds in the garden . The next night Valentine pretended he had had the same dream , and again she made no comment . He offered the dream on the next , and asked for a speaking of it . Stauminaup said , " The speaking of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His cheeks reddened . He went slinking away from her chamber . Five days later , he was told by Talinot Esulde that he had been granted admission to the Terrace of Inception . " But why ? " he asked Deliamber . The Vroon replied , " Why ? is a useless question in matters of spiritualprogress . Obviously something has altered in you . " " But I 've had no legitimate summoning dream ! " " Perhaps you have , " said the sorcerer . One of the acolytes took him , by foot , through the forest paths to the next terrace . The road was a maze , zigzagging bewilderingly , several times requiring them to turn in what seemed like precisely the wrong direction . Valentine was altogether lost by the time they ' , merged , some hours later , into a cleared area of immense size . Pyramidsof dark-blue stone ten feet high rose there at regular intervals from the pink flagstone of the terrace . Life was much the same here  --  menial tasks , meditation , daily dream-speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the beginning of holy instruction , an hour each afternoon in whichp264the principles of the grace of the Lady were explained by means of elliptical parables and circuitous dialogues . Valentine listened restlessly to all that at first . It seemed vague and abstract to him , and it was hard to concentrate on such cloudy matters when what possessed him was a direct political passion  --  to reach Castle Mount and settle the questioning of the governing of Majipoor . But by the third day it struck him that what the acolyte was saying about the role of the Lady was entirely political . She was a tempering force , Valentine realized , a mortar of love and faith bindingtogether the centers of power on this world . However she worked her magic of dream-sending  --  and it was impossible to believe the popularmyth , that she was in touch with the minds of millions of people every night  --  it was clear that her calm spirit soothed and eased the planet . The apparatus of the King of Dreams , Valentine knew , sent direct and specific dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sendings of the King could be fierce . But as the warmth of the ocean moderates the climate of the land , so did the Lady make gentle the harsh forces of control on Majipoor , and the theology that had arisen around the person of the Lady as Divine Mother Incarnate was , Valentine now understood , only a metaphor for the division of power that the early rulers of Majipoor had devised . So he listened with keener interest . He put aside his eagerness to move to loftier terraces for a time , in order to learn more here . Valentine was entirely alone at this terrace . That was new . Shanamirand Vinorkis were nowhere to be seen  --  had they been sent on already to the Terrace of Mirrors ?  --  and the rest , so far as he knew , remained behind . Most of all he missed Carabella 's sparkling energies and Deliamber 's sardonic wisdom , but the others too had become part of his soul in the long difficult journey across Zimroel , and not to have them about him here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone and never to be recaptured . Occasionally now he would , in leisure moments , take fruits from the trees and toss them in the old familiar patterns , to the amusement of passing novices and acolytes . One in particular , a thick-shouldered black-bearded man named Farssal , made a point of watching closely whenever Valentine juggled . " Where did you learn those arts ? " Farssal asked . " In Pidruid , " Valentine said . " I was with a juggling troupe . " " It must have been a fine life . " " It was , " said Valentine , remembering the excitement of standingp265before the dark-visaged Lord Valentine in the arena at Pidruid , and of stepping out onto the vast stage of Dulorn 's Perpetual Circus , and all the rest , unforgettable scenes of his past . Farssal said , " Can those skills be taught , or is it an inborn knack ? " " Anyone can learn , anyone with a quick eye and the willingness to concentrate . I learned myself in just a week or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've juggled all your life ! " " Not before last year . " " What led you to take it up , then ? " Valentine smiled . " I needed a livelihood , and there were traveling jugglers in Pidruid for the Coronal 's festival , who had need of an extra pair of hands . They taught me quickly , as I could teach you . " " You could , do you think ? " " Here , " Valentine said , and tossed the black-bearded man one of the fruits he was juggling , a firm green bishawar . " Throw that back and forth between your hands awhile , to loosen your fingers . You must master a few basic positions , and certain habits of perception , which will take practice , and then  --  " " What did you do before you were a juggler ? " asked Farssal as he tossed the fruit . " I wandered about , " said Valentine . " Here : hold your hands in this fashion  --  " He drilled Farssal half an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him at the inn in Pidruid . It was a welcome diversion in this placid and monotonous life . Farssal had quick hands and good eyes , and learned rapidly , though not nearly so rapidly as Valentine had . Within a few days he had developed most of the elementaryskills and could juggle after a fashion , though not gracefully . He was an outgoing and talkative man , who kept up a steady flow of ' conversation as he flipped the bishawars from hand to hand . Born in Ni-moya , he said ; for many years a merchant in Piliplok ; recently overtaken by a spiritual crisis that had thrust him into confusion and then sent him on the Isle pilgrimage . He talked of his marriage , his unreliable sons , his winning and losing huge fortunes at the gaming-tables ; and he wanted to know all about Valentine as well , his family , his ambitions , the motives that had brought him to the Lady . Valentine dealt with these queries as plausibly as he could , and turned aside the most awkward ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At , the end of the second week  --  toil , study , meditation , periodsp266of free time spent juggling with Farssal , a stable and static round  --  Valentine felt restlessness coming over him again , the yearning to be moving onward . He had no idea how many terraces there were  --  nine ? ninety ?  --  but if he spent this much time at each , he might be years in reaching the Lady . Some means of abbreviating the process of ascent was needed . Counterfeit summoning-dreams did not seem to work . He trotted forth his drifting-in-the-pool dream for Silimein , his dream-speaker here , but she was no more impressed by it than Stauminaup had been . He tried , during his meditation periods and when he was falling asleep at night , to reach forth to the mind of the Lady and implore her to summon him . This produced nothing useful either . He asked those who sat near him in the dining-hall how long they had been at the Terrace of Inception . " Two years , " said one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And you ? " he asked Farssal . Farssal said he had arrived only a few days before Valentine . But he felt no impatience about moving on . " There 's no hurry , is there ? We serve the Lady wherever we may be , do n't you think ? So one terrace is as good as another . " Valentine nodded . He hardly dared disagree . Late in the third week he thought he caught sight of Vinorkis far across the field of stajja where he was working . But he was not sure  --  was that a flash of orange on that Hjort 's whiskers ?  --  and the distance was too great for shouting . The next day , though , as Valentine stood casually juggling with Farssal near the bathing-pool , he saw Vinorkis , unquestionably Vinorkis , watching from the other side of the plaza . Valentine excused himself and jogged over . After so many weeks sundered from his old companions here , even the Hjort was a welcome sight . " Then it was you in the stajja-fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days I 've had several glimpses of you , my lord . But the terrace is so huge  --  I 've never been able to come close . When did you arrive ? " " About a week after you . Are there others of us here ? " " Not so far as I know , " the Hjort replied . " Shanamir was , but he 's moved on . I see you 've lost none of your juggling skill , my lord . Who 's your partner ? " " A man of Piliplok . Quick with his hands . " " And with his tongue as well ? " Valentine frowned . " What do you mean ? "  | " Have you said much to this man of your past , my lord , or of your future ? " " Of course not . " Valentine stared . " No , Vinorkis ! Surely no spies of the Coronal right here on the Lady 's own Isle ! " " Why not ? Is it so hard to infiltrate this place ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after I glimpsed you in the fields , I came here to make inquiry about you . One of those I spoke to was your new friend , ray lord . Asked him if he knew you and he started questioning me . Was I your friend , had I known you in Pidruid , why had we come t o the Isle , and so on and so on . My lord , I am uneasy when strangers ask questions . Especially in this place , where one is taught to remain apart from others . " " You may be too suspicious , Vinorkis . " " Maybe so . But guard yourself anyway , my lord . " " That I will , " said Valentine . " He 'll learn nothing from me but what he 's already had . Which is merely some juggling . " " He may already know too much about you , " said the Hjort gloomfly . " But let us watch him , even as he watches you . " The notion that he might be under surveillance even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had Sleet beside him , or Deliamber . A spy now might well become an assassin later , as Valentine drew closer to the Lady and became that much more of a peril to the usurper . But Valentine seemed to be drawing no closer to the Lady . Another week went by in the same fashion as before . Then , just as he was coming to believe he would spend the rest of his days at the Terrace of Inception , and when he was reaching a point where it mattered little to him if he did , he was called from the fields and told to make ready to go on to the Terrace of Mirrors . This third terrace was a place of dazzling beauty , with a glitter that reminded Valentine of Dulorn . It nestled against the base of Second Cliff , a forbidding vertical wall of white chalk that seemed an absolute barrier to further inward progress , and when the sun was in the west the ' lice of the cliff was such a wonder of reflected brilliance that it MWrrred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , too , there were the mirrors  --  great rough-hewn slabs of poi/ished black stone set edgewise in the ground everywhere about this terrace , so that wherever one looked one encountered one 's own image , glowing against a shining inner light . Valentine at first studied himself critically , searching for the changes that his journey had brought upon him , some dimming of the warm radiance that had flowed from him since the Pidruid days , or perhaps marks of weariness or stress . But he saw none of that , only the familiar golden-haired smiling man , and he waved to himself and winked amiably and saluted , and then , after a week or so , ceased to notice his reflection at all . If he had been ordered to ignore the mirrors he would probably have lived in guilty tension , flicking his gaze involuntarily toward them and wrenchingit away ; but no one here told him what purpose the mirrors served or what attitude he should take toward them , and in time he simply forgot them . This , he realized much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isle : evolution of the spirit from within , a growing ability to discern and discard the irrelevant . He was entirely alone here . No Shanamir , no Vinorkis , and no Farssal . Valentine kept close watch for the black-bearded man : if indeedhe was some sort of spy , he would doubtless find a way to follow Valentine from terrace to terrace . But Farssal did not arrive . Valentine stayed at the Terrace of Mirrors eleven days and went onward , in the company of five other novices , via a floater-sled to the rim of Second Cliff and the Terrace of Consecration . From here there was a magnificent view back over the first three terraces , far below , to the distant sea . Valentine could barely see the Terrace of Assessment  --  only a thin line of pink against the dark green of the forest  --  but the great Terrace of Inception spread out awesomely at the mid-point of the lower plateau , and the Terrace of Mirrors , just below , blazed like a million bright pyres in noonday light . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace might be . Time was losing its meaning . He had slipped entirely into the rhythm of the place . He worked in the fields ; he attended lengthy sessions of spiritual instruction ; he spent much of his time in the darkened stone-roofed building that was the shrine of the Lady , asking , in a way that was not really asking at all , that illumination be granted him . Occasionally he remembered that he had intended to go quickly to the heart of the Isle and to the woman who dwelled there . But there seemed little urgency to any of that now . He had become a true pilgrim . Beyond the Terrace of Consecration lay the Terrace of Flowers , and beyond that the Terrace of Devotion , and then the Terrace of Surrender . All these were of Second Cliff , as was the Terrace of Ascent ,  |p269which  was the final stage before one went up onto the plateau where the Lady lived . Each of the terraces , Valentine came to understand , completely encircled the island , so that there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more , and each pilgrim saw only a tiny segment of the whole as he pursued his course toward the center . flow much effort had gone into constructing all this ! How many lives had been given over entirely to the Lady 's service ! And each pilgrim moved within a sphere of silence : no friendships were begun here , no confidences were exchanged , no lovers embraced . Farssal had been a mysterious exception to that custom . It was as though this place existed outside of time and apart from the ordinary rituals of life . In this middle zone of the Isle there was less emphasis on teaching , more on toil . When he reached Third Cliff , he knew , he would join those who actually carried out the Lady 's work in the world at large ; for it was not the Lady herself , he now understood , who emanated most sendings to the world , but rather the millions of advanced acolytesof Third Cliff , whose minds and spirits became amplifiers for the Lady 's benevolence . Not that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gathered , had spent decades on Second Cliff , performing administrative tasks , with neither the hope nor the desire of moving toward the more taxing responsibilities of the inner zone . In his third week at the Terrace of Devotion , Valentine was granted what he knew to be an unmistakable summoning-dream . He saw himself crossing that parched purple plain that had darkenedhis sleep in " Pidruid . The sun was low at the horizon and the sky was harsh and bleak , and ahead of him lay two broad mountain ranges that rose like giant swollen fists . In the jagged boulder-strewn valley between them the last ruddy glimmer of sunlight was visible , a peculiar oily light , ominous , more a stain than a radiance . A cool dry wind blew out of that strangely illuminated valley , and on it came sighing , singing sounds , soft melancholy melodies riding the breeze . Valentine walked for hours but made no progress : the mountains grew no nearer , the desert sands extended themselves infinitely as he trekked , that last shard of light did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced before him . He saw Simonan Barjazid , the King of Dreams , and his three sons . He saw the ghastly senile Pontifex roaring on his subterranean throne . He saw monstrous amorfibotscrawling sluggishly in the dunes , and the snouts of massive dhumkars rising like augers out of the sands , probing the air for prey . Things hissed and twanged and whispered ; insects swarmed in nasty little clouds ; a rain of dry sand began to fall , lightly , clogging his ayes and nostrils . lie was weary and ready at any moment to yieldp270and halt , to lie down in the sand and let the shifting dunes cover him , but one thing drew him on , for in the valley a glowing figure moved to and fro , a smiling woman , the Lady his mother , and so long as she could be seen there he would not cease pressing forward . He felt the warmth of her presence , the pull of her love . " Come , " she murmured . " Come to me , Valentine ! " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His shoulders sagged . His knees weakened . He could not continue , though he knew he must . " Lady , " he whispered , " I am at my end , I must rest , I must sleep ! " At that the glow between the mountains grew warmer and brighter . " Valentine , " she called . " Valentine , my son ! " He could scarcely keep his eyes open . It was so tempting to lie down in the warm sand . " You are my son , " came the voice of the Lady across that impossible distance , " and I have need of you , " and as she said these words he found new strength , and walked more rapidly , and then began to run lightly over the hard , crusted desert floor , his heart lifting , his stride widening . Now the distances quickly dwindled , and Valentine could see her clearly , awaiting him on a terrace of violet-hued stone , smiling , reachingto him with outstretched arms , calling his name in a voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of her voice still ringing in his mind . It was dawn . Wondrous energy flooded his spirit . He rose and went down to the great amethystine basin that was the bathing-pool at the Terrace of Devotion , and plunged boldly into the chilly springwater . Afterward he trotted to the chamber of Menesipta , his dreamspeakerhere , a compact , fine-honed person with flashing dark eyes and a taut , spare face , and poured forth the dream to her in one long rush of words . Menesipta sat silently . The coolness of her response dampened Valentine 's exuberance . He remembered going to Stauminaup at the Terrace of Assessment with the fraudulent summoning-dream of the volevant , and how swiftly Stauminaup had dismissed that dream . But this was no fraud . He had no Deliamber here to do witcheries on his mind . Valentine said at length , " May I ask an evaluation ? " " The dream has familiar overtones , " Menesipta replied calmly . " Is that your whole speaking of it ? " She seemed amused . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fists in frustration . " If someone came tome for a speaking of such a dream , I would call it a dream of summoning . " Very well . "  | " Do you agree ? Would you call it a dream of summoning ? " " If it would please you . " " Pleasing me is n't the point , " said Valentine , irritated . " Either the dream was a dream of summoning or it was n't . What is your view of it ? " Smiling obliquely , the dream-speaker said , " I call your dream a dream of summoning . " " And now ? " " Now ? Now you have your morning duties to observe . " " A dream of summoning , as I understand it , " said Valentinetightly , " is required in order to attain the presence of the Lady . " " Indeed . " " Should I not advance now to Inner Temple ? " Menesipta shook her head . " No one goes from Second Cliff to Inner Temple . Only when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to call you inward . Your dream is interesting and important , but it changes nothing . Go to your duties , Valentine . " Anger throbbed in him as he left her chamber . He knew he was Ix+ing foolish , that a mere dream could not be enough to sweep him past the remaining hurdles that separated him from the Lady , and yet he had expected so much from it  --  he had hoped Menesipta would clap her hands and cry out in joy and ship him at once to Inner Temple , and none of that had happened , and the letdown was painful and infuriating . More pain ensued . As he came from the fields two hours later nn acolyte intercepted him and said bluntly , " You are ordered immediutIy to the harbor at Taleis , where new pilgrims await your guidance . " Valentine was stunned . The last thing he wanted now was to be sent back to the starting point . He was to set out at once , on foot and alone , making his way out ward from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assessment in the shortest possible time . They provided him at the terrace commissary with enough food to see him as far as the Terrace of Flowers . They gave him also a direction-finding device , on amulet to be fastened to his arm , that would scan for buried roadmarkersand emit a soft high pinging sound . At . midday he left the Terrace of Devotion . But the path he chose Was t he one inward toward the Terrace of Surrender , not the one that would take him back toward the coast . The decision came suddenly and with unarguable force . He simply could not allow himself t , o be turned away from the Lady . **31;7662;TOOLONG  --  and there was even a medium-sized new factory producing " crafts of the region " and other mendacities , and it did an excellentbusiness among the " summer people , " who declared the products " quaint . " There was also a very popular restaurant called the Amish House , where one could dine on shoofly pie , " country " ham , scrapple , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The fact that the nearest Amish settlement was some forty miles away was not known by the summer people , who relished " the lavish food of the region . " They also loved Patrick Mulligan 's " old-country " Inn-Tavern , and the gentlemen loved the young relatives of Mrs. Lindon , and Mrs. Lindon loved the generouspatrons of her establishment . The inspired mayor did not agree to having all the main streets covered with macadam . He insisted that some should be kept bricked and cobblestoned , so the lady summer visitors could gush over the " unspoiled " charm . Almost no houses now had backyard privies , except a few on the outskirts , and these , at the mayor 's urging , were wreathed in vines during the summer , and kept whitewashed and comparativelyodor-free . Belleville began to respect itself . Bernard once said , " They should have put up an iron statue to old Johnny Myers instead of Bill Penn . " He was referring to the mayor , of course , who would have agreed with him , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful people , whom he promptly forgot . Guests came to Ipswich House as early as mid-April from as far away as Philadelphia , Scranton , Wilkes-Barre , and , to the awe of the inhabitants of the town , even from New York and New Jersey . On a clear day , it was boasted , one could stand in the gardens of the hotel and see three states , or a reasonable suggestion thereof . The railroad had put in a spur that reached almost to the foot of the mountain , to provide easy access to the hotel for the summer people , and the hotel met the guests at the pretty little depot with a string of glittering carriages and two large automobiles . A bicycle trail had been added to the road , meandering down through an avenue of tidy trees and pruned flowering bushes . A brook had been discovered , smothered in earth and wild growth , and it had been enlarged and cleared and now tumbleddown in a very pleasing fashion to the river , over artful little dams . " Weirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly over five years , Belleville had beenp211quite " transformed , " to quote the more ecstatic inhabitants . It was all due , of course , to Patrick Mulligan , on whom affection was bestowed on all occasions . There was talk about electing him mayor , but the more restrained inhabitants of Belleville objected . " An Irish mayor ? Heaven forbid ! " That silenced the enthusiastic . Bernard , with his friend and employer , was enjoying this unusuallymild April sunlight , " warming our old bones , " as Saul said . " Who 's old ? " grunted Bernard . " Speak for yourself , Saul , and you six years younger . " " You 'll never grow old , " said Saul with admiration , his voice carrying the thick accents of his native Germany . " Quite right , " said Bernard . " The Irish do n't believe in it . " Saul chuckled , shifting his fat buttocks on the slats of the bench . The blue smoke from his treasured meerschaum pipe rose contentedly in the shining air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had cost ten cents , which he considered outrageous . " The Jews do n't believe in it , either , " said Saul . " Too busy runningall the time from pogroms . Got to have young legs . " New , tentative leaves , a soft yellow-green , threw dancing shadows on the two old men below . The winding paths through the park were of zealously raked gravel , which people said was picturesque ; flowerbeds , showing rows of buoyant tulips , mostly red , bordered the walks . Later there would be other flowers in season , lovingly cared for and very neat . No child dared to stamp on those beds or pick any blossoms . Activity among children was severely kept in check by parents proud of the park if not of their offspring . No picnics were allowed , and a shower of chewing-gum wrappers brought swift punishment to the offender . " Keep Off the Grass " signs were meticulously obeyed . Dogs were outlawed in the park . Even the birds looked disciplined as they flashed through the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-four now , a vigorous and lively eighty-four . Always spare , his body was still hard muscle , quick and springy when he walked or trotted , a quick marching step he had learned in the British army . It was nearly as fast as it had been in his youth . But his flesh now resembled the driftwood washed up on the stony shores of the sea , dark and with a dim silvery shine . His gray eyes were still vital , even if nested in deep wrinkles , and his large nose was as arrogant and defiant as ever . The , plow of years might have cleft his sunken cheeks , but the mouth between themp212was stem and forbidding and the teeth within were strong and clean as always . His totally white hair had diminished , but the crestlike way it rose over his forehead was still like the crest on a Roman helmet . His chin had retained its pugnacity . He had not lost his formidable look . The years had not gentled him . Rather , they had increased his native ferocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sloth , lies , cruelty , weakness , or general ineptitude . The world was " a bastard of a place , " he would say , " and I do n't know why the good Lord has n't smashed it by now . " His mind was like a knife , sharp and brilliantly honed . He did not need glasses to read . His hand , now roped with veins , lifted to his cigar . He raised his eyes to the distant view . " Age , " he remarked , " is a matter of opinion . I 've seen buckos in their fifties and sixties whining about the long years they have lived . They are tired , ' they say . Tired of what ? Living , perhaps . But then , I 'm thinking , they never really lived . " " Work , " said Saul , " keeps a man young . " " Depends , " said Bernard , who hated platitudes . " I 've seen work kill , that I have . It 's how a man looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he not ? Simple as that , then . " He studied the far scene with little visible pleasure . But few things had ever pleased Bernard , and Saul suspected that this was the source of Bernard 's vitality . He would never be complacent or sentimental . Saul considered him fondly , as one would a brother . In contrast with the tall gaunt Bernard , Saul was like a plump small cushion , extremely trim and turned and comfortable , rosy as a peony in full bloom . His three round chins were excellently barbered , as was his thick white hair , and he had a rigorously trimmed white mustache which did not hide his kind smiling mouth . He might be poor , but his blue serge suit was pressed  --  by himself  --  at least twice a week , and his striped shirt daily knew an iron , and his stiff white collar and cuffs  --  celluloid  --  never had a stain upon them . Though it was only April , he wore a shining white straw hat with a gay red band around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had sweet round brown eyes that seemed to be perpetually smiling . He was a childless widower of many years and hardly remembered his Anna , who had had a stringent tongue and had stood at least a foot taller than himself . She had also kept kosher . Saul had long forgiven her that ,  |p213but  he had never forgotten . He would sometimes remember with a shudder , especially around the time of Passover . However , in her memory , he ate matzohs and prepared gefilte fish for himself , both of which he deplored but which Bernard found tasty and enjoyable . " When in Rome , " he would say to Bernard , " do as the Romans do ; that 's what I read . I 'm American now . " " And Americans cook as bad as the English , I 'm thinking , " said Bernard as he would spear another piece of fish . He shook his fork admonishingly at Saul . " Niver forget the ould ways . D' you want the world all one color , one culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted variety , and that he did . Think of flowers of only one color , say , purple , which I hate . Who would want a garden , if so ? " Saul 's cheery face would grow momentarily sad . " It would be safer , " he said . Bernard had snorted . " And what 's a world without danger ? Tell me that , bucko . Damned dull place . That 's why I niver could stomach the talk of heaven and pearly gates and streets of gold . Who would want it ? Give me battle , every time . " And he thought of his youth and his fists and his sturdy kicking boot , and he smiled nostalgically . He would then talk of Ireland and the " cursed Sassenagh " and would embellish his bloody stories , relishingthe many confrontations , which he usually had won . His slategrayeyes would become like glittering stones on which lightning had suddenly struck . The two old gentlemen , on this warm April day , sat in peaceful silence together , Saul listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , on its plateau , stood the completed hotel , Ipswich House . It was a sight , Bernard admitted to himself dourly , to please the most contentious eye , though he would never confess that to anyone . The architect had agreed to pale yellow brick and stucco and a red-tiled roof and bronze doors , and there the great hotel stood like an enormous U , on its noble acres , half-hidden by clusters of timber oaks and firs and maples and linden trees , with here and there a royal elm . The immense lawns were greening , as they sloped and stretched with the curve of the mountain meadow . Flowerbeds , even this early , gleamed with the satiny heads of narcissus and tulips of many colors . The hotel was open all win/ter , too , for the new fad of skiing , and sledding and skating , and was particularly gay at the Christmas holidays , " with guests from a dozen states , " the brochure stated proudly , exaggerating only slightly . With fires blazing in almost every room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens at every window and enormous Christmas trees in the public rooms dancing with tinsel and glass balls and toy reindeer and Santa Clauses , and ballroom music every night and liquors and wines donated by the management , it was a joyous and resplendent time at the resort . Only during the holidays were children permitted in any number , on the wise advice of Mrs. Lindon , who firmly believed children sabotaged any attempts at adult enjoyment . In short , Ipswich House was a haven for those males who were in flight from exigentwives and untidy offspring , and who were usually accompanied by lovely young ladies who answered to the name of " Mrs. , " though everyone knew they were not married to their escorts . Younger males , however , still filled with illusions , arrived with their legal spouses , to return every year for several years , until they , too , discreetly brought with them more amiable ladies with dash and spirit and much happy laughter . There had not been an empty room in summer after the first year , and guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . Though it was only five years old , guests referred to it as " an institution . " The rooms were furnished as shown in the English model , all very expensive and all over the objections of the prudent Patrick Mulligan . But Jason had stubbornlyinsisted , and when Patrick was congratulated on the splendorand beauty of the hotel , he would say with a grand wave of his hand , " No money spared . Elegance for elegant people . " He finally included that phrase in the brochure Lionel had prepared , which was illustrated by photographs . The rates were staggering , but few complained . Sometimes , though not very often , Patrick forgot that this was all the doing of Jason Garrity , whom he loved more than he did his daughter and grandchildren . When his nephew Daniel reminded him of this fact , Patrick would say with irritation , " Do n't I know it , then ? Am I a fool ? Ah , that 's a grand bucko , my Jason . " He would pat his growing belly , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had come a long way , all of them , he would think whenp215alone in his enormous black-walnut bedroom in his own house , which was also occupied by his daughter and Jason and their three children , Sebastian , the eldest , and the twins , Nicholas and Nicole . Patricia , who endlessly read romantic novels , had picked those names for her children , much against Jason 's will . But Jason invariablypampered and indulged her , much to Bernard 's disgust and disbelief . They were all in debt , of course , to the two local banks and a large one in Philadelphia , but Patrick had been able to pay off the mortgage he had taken on the Inn-Tavern during the early days of financing . Mrs. Lindon had been of tremendous advantage here , and was , in her way , a partner in the profits . She had persuaded the two bankers in Belleville , her devoted friends , to sell her the extra acres needed  --  for cash  --  and had almost completely managed the financing of Ipswich House with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator of the " corporation . " Bernard was not certain of all the " finagling , " as he mistrustfully called it , for he hated debt of all kinds , and " obligations , " especiallyto bankers , and lawyers , whom he loathed above all other men . Had n't they been influential in the passing of the new amendment , the Federal Reserve System , which would become activein 1913 ? Had n't they stolen the right of Congress to coin money , as asserted in the Constitution ? Bernard never failed , at any opportunity , to denounce " those international robbers . " He was also aware that the " damned stupid people " had voted for the Sixteenth Amendment , a federal income tax , many times declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court . They had voted for this because of the lying promises of politicians . " They 'll know , every man jack of them , " Bernard would say , " when they , as Thomas Jefferson predicted , would eventually be taxed in their comings and their goings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their shelters , and the fruits of their labor taken from them . " Mr. Elmer Schultz , of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia , had been inducedby the knowledgeable Mrs. Lindon and her banker friends to become part of the corporation and invest money , and had brought in his best architects to design Ipswich House in exact accordance with Jason 's wishes and his grandfather 's picture book detailing the English establishment . They had deplored the expense , but Jason , quoting Bernard , said , " In for a penny , in for ap216pound , " which Mr. Schultz had considered , and then had reluctantlyagreed to . Jason was now manager of Ipswich House at a large salary , and in view of the fact that he had contributed his vital fourteen acres , was given fifteen percent of the net proceeds , which were growing year after year . Lionel , in charge of the dining rooms and the purchasingof foods and wine and liquors , and the supervision of the kitchens , and all those employed in the work of purveyance , also received a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason was the final authority in all things at Ipswich House , except for Patrick Mulligan , who rarely interfered . He had his own hands full with the management of the Inn-Tavern , which also was flourishing . Lionel was given , in addition to salary , one percent of the net profits and an annual bonus because of his priceless genius in stimulating business . He wrote the flamboyant brochures . He also kept the workers under his rule honest , to a great extent , and that was no light struggle . All concerned were ebullient and optimistic , sometimes even Jason , who had become unnaturally cautious and morose . Bernard knew nothing of the intricacies of mortgages and financing and bonuses and profits and expansion , and so was less than enthusiastic when Jason would attempt to enlighten him . He would wave his hand dismissingly and say , " When a man 's in partnership with bankers , he 's mortgaged himself to the Devil , and that he has . Niver was a banker a friend of man , except if that man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His mistrust had become greater the last year or so , when Jason had announced that the corporaton had bought one thousand acres of land forty miles away , also in the Poconos , for " a family hotel , for all seasons , " a hotel at least twice as large as Ipswich House . The foundationhad already been dug and contractors engaged . " Mark my words , " Bernard had said with gloomy alarm , " you 'll all end up in debtors ' prison . And do n't tell me there are no debtors ' prisons in America ! You 'll have them soon , with this new federal-income-tax business . " " Oh , Da , " Jason would reply . " You 're too pessimistic . Were n't we all promised that the new federal-income-tax amendment would apply only to the very rich , and then only two or three percent ? The government does n't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg . "  | " They always do ! " shouted Bernard . " And why , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . Lord Acton said that himself , and even if he is a Sassenagh , he spoke truly . The power to tax is the power to destroy . ' Read your history , damn you . What are you doing with all those books I gave you ? No man should vote unless he knows what he 's voting for and knows what is good for his country . " " A new Jeremiah is heard in the land , " Jason said , but not without some uneasiness . " About time , " grunted Bernard . " But too late , I 'm thinking . " " The Irish never trusted governments , " said Jason . " With damned good reason ! " Beside Bernard , Saul was half-dozing in the unseasonably warm April sun . Saul had comforting silences , and Bernard reflected that he himself needed comforting . Once , a man of his years had peace . Now there was no peace anywhere . Like an Irish farmer who could smell snow long before it arrived , Bernard smelled trouble in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German kaiser because he was building up his armed forces ? " That German feller , " Bernard would confide to Saul , " knows something we do n't . But you can wager he probably has reason for his suspicions . Perhaps because Germany is so prosperous , with no slums , and the rest of us are always in and out of Panics . " Bernard had taken to reading Das Kapital , by Karl Marx , but no one would listen to his views on Communism but Saul Weitzman , who would nod soberly . " It 's an old tyranny , " Bernard would say . " It crops up , eventually , in every country , and that 's the end of the poor sods . Goes back to Egypt and Babylonia . I 'll give you another book . Eugene Debs , American socialist . In prison for conspiracy to kill . They do love their killings , these humanitarians . Killing 's their ultimate way of proving they love mankind . " And Bernard would laugh bitterly . " I 'm glad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children I think about , and what they 're going to face . I 'll be thankfully dead . " Three youths wandered by , giggling among themselves as they told each other salacious stories . They kicked up the gravel and guffawed . Bernard studied them grimly . The Farrell lads  --  Joe and Mike and Matthew  --  the oldest sixteen and a worker in one of the mills , Mike , fifteen , on his first job in a new small factory , andp218Matt , the youngest , a hellion of about twelve . Their dada , thought Bernard , was a good and prosperous man , with a hardware store and a blacksmith shop which also catered to those who owned automobiles , and a sound little body of a wife who beamed happily at everyone . How did two such get sons like these , always in mischief . Dennis , their father , had wanted the two oldest to finish high school , but they were too dull of wit to continue , and the youngest , who was the most intelligent , was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their father , who had been born in Ireland , and though they feared and obeyed him most of the time , they also hated him for his sternness . They despised their mother , who adored them , and exploited her generous and tender heart . Kathleen Farrell reminded Bernard of his dead daughter-inlaw , Katie . Bad blood somewheres , Bernard would think , when he encounteredthem . They were afraid of Bernard , to some extent , and the cane he carried with him . They wandered off , but a moment or two later young Matt crept up behind Saul and smashed down his gay straw hat over his ears . " Kosher kike ! " the boy yelled , and at a distance , his brothers laughed like jackasses . Bernard sprang to his feet , clutching his cane , but the boys ran off like hares . " Never mind , " said Saul , ruefully examining his ruined hat . " Only boys . They mean no harm . " Bernard shouted , " They do n't , eh ? And it 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in trouble , in spite of their dada 's leather belt , and it 's sorry I am for Dennis and his lady . " He sat down , breathing heavily , his grayish face mottled with dangerouscolor . " I 'd like to beat the shit out of them , myself . Could do a better job than their dada , whose arm is always being held back by Kathleen . Wimin ! They should niver have the rearing of men-children , niver . My mum niver dared raise her voice to my faether , or interfere . And many 's the time he laid us boys out , though he left the colleens to Mum . " He took Saul 's hat from him , and cursed . Saul was a poor man ; he paid Bernard eight dollars a week for six days in his shop , and could not understand why Bernard remained in the old shanty when his son , Jason , was only too anxious  --  as was Patrick Mulligan  --  tohave the old man live in the ugly luxurious house where Patrick still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite Patricia 's endless tears and nagging for a new home.  | " In the old country , the generations live together , and everybody is happy , " Saul would urge . " I doubt it , " Bernard would answer . " I 'm independent , I am , and I like living alone . Niver was one for stumbling over a family . " He said , now , " It 's your birthday coming , Saul . I 'll buy you anotherhat . With a green ribbon , " and he chuckled sourly , and weighed his heavy cane in his hand with some wistfulness . There was a coolness these years between him and Jason . Bernardnever explained why . But he would think : And it 's a grandsonof mine who got his wife in the family way for two months before he married her ! I thought better of Jason . Not a sneaking rascal  --  I thought . Not one to take advantage of a poor trusting girl  --  I thought . Then suddenly running off with her to a justice of the peace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a priest until two weeks later to sanctify the marriage , and not the lovely wedding for his girl that Pat had dreamed of since she was born . Thought better of Jason . And everyone saying , and the doctors , that Sebastian was a seventh-month baby , and everyone believingit but me . You do n't have a fine boy like Sebastian being born weighing over seven pounds , if he 's a seventh-month baby . But fools believe what they want to believe , and Pat 's a power in Belleville and brought prosperity here . Wonder if he 's fooled himself . Probably . But only too glad to have Jason as his son-in-law , no matter how it came about . Father Sweeney had remarried the two renegades  --  as Bernard called them  --  and Father Sweeney had baptized the children , and never said a word . Discreet , thought Bernard , and did not know whether to be grateful or not . But the priest had been vehement enough when he had persuaded his lordship the bishop not to inflict John Garrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordained . There was a meek little German lad now as Father Sweeney 's assistant . The parish had grown over these years . John was assistant pastor to an old arthritic priest in Scranton , in a depressedparish , and as the old priest " had taken to the bottle , poor soul , for his pains , " and John was very vigilant and active and seemed everywhere at once , no one complained . Jason could not understand the coolness between him and his grandfather . As he was reticent by nature , he had not asked . Jason believed his older son to be his own , and that Sebastian was in/deed a seventh-month child . He had been told so by two physicians , very prudent men who knew the truth but who were afraid of Patrick Mulligan . They too surmised that Jason had got Patriciainto " a delicate condition " at least two months prior to the marriage . Patrick , the innocent , also believed in the fable of the premature baby . He would never have believed that his sheltered darling had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any man . Only three knew the truth : Daniel Dugan , now married to Molly Nolan , and Lionel and Joan Garrity . Lionel had married Joan four months after he had abandoned Patricia . He adored her almost abjectly ; he trusted her absolutely , and she trusted him . A cynic by nature , Joan had accepted with celestial equanimity Lionel 's confession that he most probably was Sebastian 's father . " Well , it 's over and done with , " she had said , " and the girl is a fool and always was , and because Sebastian is your own , my darling , I love him also . " This was no lie . Unable to bear children herself , she did indeed love the child , as his mother did not . He was Lionel 's . Joan did not pity her deceived brother . She had never considered him of much consequence , anyway , and had even despised him . She was totally convinced that without Lionel he would be nothing , and she resented her brother as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel had not told Molly of his knowledge . Molly had a sharp tongue , and under all that adorable independence and intrepid demeanor was a soul easily outraged at injustice and betrayal . She might have blurted out the truth , and would never have understoodthat some things are better hidden . Once Molly had said , innocently , " He 's very big , the baby , for being premature , is n't he , Dan ? " And Daniel , looking gravely thoughtful , had replied , " But Jason is a big man , my love , and Patty is no midget . And Jason 's grandfather is a giant , too . " Molly was glad that her brother , Lionel , and his wife , Joan , had no children . " There 's enough wickedness in this world , Dan , and those two are genuinely wicked , without adding to their number . " Daniel agreed . Molly was still childless after three years , and this saddened them both . Bernard , sitting with Saul on the sun-warmed bench in the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he loved devotedly , and the twins , Nicholas and Nicole . Idioticp221names ! Bernard knew that Patricia did not even try to hide the fact that she disliked Sebastian , ignored and slighted him , and complained of him always . There were times when one saw real hate in her eyes as she looked at the little boy . Yet , he was gravely handsome , tall for his age , and always courteous and obedient and unfailingly kind . To Bernard he had " a lovely face , " for it was square and serious , with good bones , large agate-colored eyes like his mother 's , a short sharply defined nose , a faintly smiling mouth which did not detract from his usual gravity , and thick curling brown hair with a hint of deep red in the clustering waves . A true Garrity , Bernard would think . The boy was already being tutored at home , and he had intellect as well as intelligence . He kept his childish thoughts to himself , but Bernard suspected that they were not childish at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-year-old twins were another matter . Nicholas was , as Bernard described it , " disjointed . " He was small even for three , and incessantly in motion , giving the appearance of a crudely carved marionette held by uncertain but vibratingstrings . He ran and moved very fast and was always falling , for despite his smallness and his compact frame , he was clumsy . He also wailed , even though not hurt by these mishaps , and then would spring feverishly to his feet and scamper off , his arms and legs not quite coordinated , and thrown out as if he was in flight . He had a rectangular face , sallow and bony , with the large Garrity nose , a tremulous excited mouth , and dark slate-colored eyes protrudingas if he were out of breath , which he usually was . He had Patricia 's thin fine hair , perpetually in disarray and always droopingover his forehead and into his eyes . He had large ears which were strangely a bright pink . He gave the impression of incurable dishevelment . He was " harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but no brains at all . " When Patricia mentioned that he had a delicate natureand was exquisitely sensitive , Bernard would snort to himself . " An artist , " Patricia would declare with passionate love , " and alwaystrying to draw pictures . " It was his twin sister , Nicole , who had " the brains . " But to many people she was a most ugly little girl , for she was even shorter than her brother , and at three a veritable fat dumpling of a child , shapeless and all belly , with thick arms and legs and a round fat face . Her skin was coarse , though she was hardly morep222than an infant , with no rosiness of cheek or mouth . But her face was perpetually resolute , her lips extremely firm and controlled , her chin heavy and dimpled . She had the look of a matron , which amused Bernard , for she resembled his grandmother amazingly . Her brown hair was harsh if abundant , and without light . No nonsenseabout the little colleen , Bernard would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and radiant gray eyes with long dark lashes like stars . Despite her fatness , which was mostly muscle , she moved with surety , like Sebastian , and always with purpose . No pretty frocks could conceal that stalwart little body with its square shoulders and large belly and broad chest . Frills and bows , on which Patriciainsisted , mocked the strength that was so evident , and made her look like a parody of a frivolously bedecked doll . When she walked , one could hear her steady footsteps even on the heaviest carpets . Bernard watched Nicole with affectionate amusement . " A tartar , " he said once , without disapproval . " She 'll make her way , but God help the man she 'll marry . He 'll know who 's in charge , from the start . " Patricia thought her daughter " adorable " and a beauty , and never noticed the ridiculous disparity between the dainty name and Nicole herself . From babyhood Nicole had understood her twin brother . Even at three , she was sorry for him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped away his endless tears . All her actions , with him , were maternal . In spite of Patricia 's rebukes , Nicolecalled her brother Nick and he called her Nickie . It infuriated Patricia that between Sebastian and Nicole there was a profound sympathy , and that both children had made themselvesthe guardians of the disorganized Nicholas . When Jason , exhausted from long hours of dealing with mutinous workers , from maids to gardeners and cleaners , to window washers and laundresses , arrived home , he would inevitably be greeted by Patricia'stinny but emphatic complaints about Sebastian , and how he was inciting the twins to many numerous crimes , especially against her . Jason loved his children , but between him and Sebastian there was an unspoken compatibility , a mature tenderness . He would take Sebastian with him to the library and shut the door , not to administer punishment , as Patricia hoped and believed , but to sitp223in gentle silence with the child on his knee , their hands clasped togetherwarmly , their eyes communicating in wordless comprehensionand consolation . Then they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen with an indignant cook , and the other children to the firelit nursery with their special nursemaid , or even with their parents occasionally . Jason could not understand  --  nor did Bernard  --  the hatred Patriciahad for her older son . But always , to Bernard 's exasperation , Jason endured her whims , complaints , and evident dislike of him and was infinitely tender and patient with her . Jason firmly believed that Patricia was of ineffable substance , above other women as a flowering tree is above ordinary grass . Ca n't he see how stupid she is ? Bernard would ask himself . How vulgar , how cunning , how selfish and self-centered , how incapable of tolerance and consideration of others ? But Jason did not see all this , just ashe could not know the source of Patricia 's aversion to Sebastian . He had persuaded himself that it was all due to " birth difficulties " and incompatible differences of temperament . He was certain time would solve these things nicely , an attitude astonishingly different from his usual realistic outlook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fall into bed overcome with weariness , only to find his mind spinning with problems , with doubts , with conflicts and worries . He and Patricia had separate bedrooms , at her insistence  --  she needed her restsince she was very high-strung . They had not slept together since the birth of the twins . Jason understood that she feared more pregnancies . She was too fragile for this world , he would think . It was odd that he had not as yet recognized how similar he and Sebastian were in nature , just as he was never doubtful of the child 's paternity . Patricia 's pettiness toward Jason , her not hidden resentment , her frequent ridicule of his person , her implied contempt for his intelligence , her cruel accusations that he had no socialgraces , never truly entered his consciousness . He was always trying to win her admiration . This , too , enraged Bernard , who thought of her as a silly and pretentious fool and a woman of no delicacy . Always thin , she was now emaciated , though she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house just as she increasinglyscorned Patrick himself and deprecated him frequently to Jason . That she was desperately unhappy was not apparent top224Jason , nor did he ever know of her tears and yearnings when alone in her bed . Bernard , in moments of rare empathy , suspected that something " ailed " her , but he could not guess what . It was unnatural for a woman who had so much to be so miserable . Bernard was thinking of all this now , and he sighed . Saul said , " We go back to the shop and have a little lunch , eh ? Made some gefilte fish , for Passover , next week . You like it , eh ? And some matzohs , and chicken soup . Not kosher . " He chuckled . " Good , " said Bernard . It was then that the Farrell youths returned , crunching on the gravel as they ran toward the two old men . They stopped at a distance , nudged each other , grinned , then began to chant : " Ido sheeney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurled it at Saul . He dodged , pale and trembling . " Off with you , damn you ! " Bernard shouted , and half-rose , seizing his cane . " And you at Mass this morning , with your dada and mum ! " " Aw shut up , you old man ! " the elder boy shouted with an obscenecurse . " Want a stone down your gullet ? " Bernard stood up . His cheeks turned crimson and the veins in his temples swelled . Saul caught his arm . " They are only children , " he pleaded . Bernard shook off his hand and glared down at him . " They 're devils , " he said . " The kind who murdered old Joe Maggiotti . God damn their souls . " " Bernie . . . " said Saul . The eldest boy turned a face of gleeful malice on him . " Wait till you see what we did to your kosher shop ! " he screamed in delight . " Peed on all your groceries and sausages ! " Saul became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oi gevalt ! " Bernard rushed at the two older youths , grasped them by the necks , and pounded their heads together . They howled and struggled . He held them with hands like iron . He looked at the youngest , Matt , who was suddenly alarmed . " Matt , " said Bernard , " I want to see your dada now , in the shop . With these spalpeens I 'm taking with me . You go for your dada or I 'll . . . I 'll kill your brothers . " He longed for the sight of blood . Saul got heavily to his feet , his kind face twisted . Matt ran off , whimpering . Bernard banged the youths ' heads together again , over and over , until they cried like infants . " Curse you , " he muttered  | " Damn the law . I 'd like to kill you , but you 're not worth hanging for . " His lips were engorged with purpling blood . He could hardly breathe ; there was a terrible pain in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he could not set loose the youths he now had again by their throats . " March , " he gasped in a hoarse voice . " Down the street . To the shop . Saul , come . " Saul picked up the discarded cane , and weeping , followed the old man and his captivesback to the shop . The door was open . A barrel of pickles had been overturned on the immaculate floor . Many eggs had been tossed at walls , and their contents were oozing over Bernard 's bright green paint . Loaves of bread had been stamped and crushed . Cans had been thrown about in fierce abandon . Milk had been poured out on every surface . Small blocks of ice had been taken from the icebox and sent skidding over the floor and under counters . Dress goods had been unfolded , befouled , and thrown about recklessly . Many were torn . Saul openly wept now , covering his face with his hands . He was poor and lived frugally by necessity . He saw months of profits hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foulness in the human soul , of monstrous cruelty and hate . He felt that his heart was crushing between stones . Bernard stood with the youths in the midst of all this , and resumed banging their heads . " Damn your souls to hell ! " he said , and he poured out his own hate on them with a string of imprecations . " Bernie , " Saul stammered . " You 're killing them . Their noses bleed . Bernie  --  " " Shut up , " said Bernard , but he halted the banging . A numbnessran down his right side , and his legs buckled . However , he did not release the youths , whose faces were streaming with blood and tears . It was then that Dennis Farrell , their father , rushed in . He saw everything immediately . " Oh , God damn , " he said . He was a tall , very lean man , muscularfrom hard labor . He had a dark narrow face and belligerent black eyes . " God damn , " he repeated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imploringly at their father . " We did n't do nothing , " the older sobbed . " Nothing at all . This crazy old man  --  " Dennis walked calmly over to his son and struck him , backhand , on the face . He did the same to the younger one . They fellp226to the filthy floor and curled up like fetuses . Dennis said , " Bernie , do you want to thrash them , or shall I ? " He removed his belt slowly , deliberately . " It 's your place , " said Bernard . He was leaning heavily against a counter , struggling for breath . The pain in his head increased unbearably . For a moment he shut his eyes . His breathing was like a groan . " But who 's to pay for all this destruction , Dennie ? " " I will , " said the younger Irishman . " Saul , you make out a bill . Get you the money from the bank tomorrow . " He added , " Never raised them this way . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this with the kids . Who 's doing it , teachin ' them these things ? Where 's the Church , the priests ? It 's not the parents , though they say it is . It 's Original Sin . " " Always was , " said Bernard . " Always will be . You ca n't cure humanity . " He could speak no more . Dennis Farrell walked to the youths on the floor , who looked up at him with affrighted eyes . Without rage , without words , he began to beat them , methodically , unsparingly . They were too afraid to scream , though they cried feebly and tried to writhe away . At last his arm tired . He put his belt back on . He said , " Now , you bastards , on your feet , and clean up here , every inch , or you 'll get more . " " Mr. Farrell . . " said Saul , who had watched , horrified . It was not the beating so much that had overcome him . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the youths with pity . So young , so bad . " Go on upstairs , Mr. Weitzman , " Dennis said . " Saul . You and Bernie , you go up . When it 's clean down here , I 'll call you . " It was then , with a dreadful cry , that Bernard Garrity collapsed on the floor , cans rolling about him , his face turned into the pickle brine . Jason had asked his friends and relatives to leave him alone with the dying man for a few minutes . The April afternoon had a sky of deep gray marbled with black streaks , like the lid of an ancient tomb . Lightning writhed through it , but there was no thunder . A long and angry wind hammered at the windows of the large hospital room , and steely rain tried to pierce the glass like arrows . Jason had donated this room to the Sisters ' Hospital , and other Catholics had " been squeezed " byp227Jason , to quote Patrick , to enlarge the building and improve it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleaner than ours ? " Jason had demanded , and Patrick and Daniel had paid up , grumbling that they would be bankrupted . Now they were proud of the hospital , with its excellent nursing staff , an operating room , and two physicians on call , a fine big kitchen , and a small chapel which could hold twenty people . The room was warm , for new furnaces had been installed and the radiator hissed comfortingly . The wooden floor had been scrubbed white , and there were gay curtains at the windows and a thick rug at the side of the high narrow bed . Everything smelled of beeswax and soap . A lamp stood on a table nearby , and its gentle light streamed on Bernard Garrity 's face . The paralyzed man could move only his head , but his eyes were as alive and aware as always . He was awake , but he did not look at Jason . " Da , " said Jason , leaning forward in his chair , " I want to know something . Blink once for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Da ? " The fallen head on its snowy pillows turned to Jason , and the vital eyes were full of accusation . Jason 's stricken face quickened with pain and grief . " All right , Da . I do n't know why there 's been a . . . division between us . I never asked . I should have . You 'd have told me the truth . Was it something I did ? " Bernard blinked twice . " My God , " said Jason , almost groaning . " I do n't know . It ca n't be the new hotel . We talked that over many times , a long time ago . Da , " and Jason leaned closer , " I never deliberately hurt anyone in my life . I never committed the sins of false witness , theft , blasphemy , or envy . I never blackened a man 's name . I 've tried all my life to be just and decent and patient , even at the worst of times . " He smiled weakly to keep from crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , either . " He never knew why Bernard 's face changed so strangely or why his eyes , though still piercing , became brighter . " Do you understand , Da ? " A long moment or two passed ; it was as if Bernard were thinking . The dying eyes blinked twice , for yes , and softened . The dying man struggled to speak . The dry white lips moved , but there was no sound . And then , to Jason 's astonishment , Bernard , fighting with his last dying efforts , raised one wavering hand . It seemed top228beckon . Jason , trembling , fell on his knees beside the bed , and the hand descended and gently lay on his thick black curls as if begging for forgiveness . " Oh , Da , " Jason moaned , and turned his head to kiss the cold dry palm of his grandfather . Now he was crying , gulping to keep back sobs . He took that feeble hand , raised with a last mortal effort , and held it tightly in his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one word ! But Jason knew that the rift between them had gone , and all was forgiven . Then the hand fell . Jason looked up , eyes filled with tears . Incredibly , Bernard , for the first time since his stroke , was smiling , a smile of infinite love and remarkabletenderness . Jason had seen this expression only a few times before , and it was always for Katie . Bernard had been given the last rites , for his death could occur at any moment . That great face might be sunken , but it remained indomitable . For Bernard in his dying did not forgive humanity for its crimes against the innocent and the helpless . To the last he questioned him whom he considered the adversary of man . God might forgive  --  but not Bernard Garrity ! Jason 's friends and relatives came in now , moving silently , with only a faint rustling . Jason rose to give Father Sweeney the one chair . The priest now looked prosperous and well-fed . His clothingwas the best silken broadcloth , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pink and full . The auburn hair had faded until streaks of white appeared in it , but he had two modest chins and a considerable potbelly . He was eating well and regularly , thanks to Jason and the bounty of Patrick Mulligan . He looked almostbenign . Standing at his shoulder was the young priest John Garrity , with his triangular face shining like bone in the lamplight and his pale eyes as censorious as ever , austerity like a grim shadow over his features . He stood , rigid and rigorous , as if at attention , and he gazed at his grandfather , who would not return his look , and his mouth was a white slash and his Garrity nose , attenuated , reminded one of the edge of an ax blade . Behind him was Lionel Nolan , standing beside his wife 's wheelchair , the antic face sober , the yellow eyes secretive and telling nothing . Joan looked , as always , like some celestial apparition , pure , immaculate , blue eyes filled with heavenly luster , black wavy hair dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in expensive furs . A single great jewel twinkled on herp229perfect hand . She looked , indeed , like some angelic visitor clothed in modem style , and an aura of light seemed to surround her . She gazed at her grandfather , and the gaze was the gaze of a compassionatesaint , though in fact she felt nothing at all but impatience . But she held the hand of the little boy she so dearly loved , Sebastian Garrity . The child 's face had a maturity far beyond his age , and was full of his usual gravity . He had been crying , for he loved Bernard and knew that he was Bernard 's favorite greatgrandchild . The lamplight brought out red lights in his brown hair , and the tendrils that crept about his ears and forehead were the color of fire . Occasionally Lionel could not help but glance at his secret son . However , discretion had long been one of his wellpracticedtraits . He was kind and affectionate to the son he loved more than even Joan could know , but though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even when the two were alone . Sebastian leaned against Joan 's arm , and she gazed at him with a passion of love only Lionel had ever seen before . Patricia was not there , nor were her other two children . " I just ca n't go , Jason , " she had told her husband . " Your grandfather never did like me and I never liked him , either . Death and illness depress me ; you know how sensitive I am , and Nicholas , too . I 'm sorry this has happened , but your grandfather is a very old man , and it really was stupid of him to do what he did at his age . No , really . Do n't press me . I would n't even go to my own father 's fu-neral . " Jason , as usual , forgave her and watched as Patrick came in with Saul Weitzman , Patrick grim and vengeful , remembering how his friend had come to this state . Bernard looked long at his grandson Jason . With the acute perceptionof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so impassive , so contained , the eyes so like his own , slate-gray and brave , the quiet mouth , the strong nose . His integrity , his sureness , even his somewhat unbending nature , were quite apparent even to the most stupid observer . A tear slowly gathered at the corner of Bernard 's left eye ; his mouth quivered . Love for Jason filled him like a wave . He detested himself for his earlier coldness and withdrawal ; he said to a God in whom he hardly believed , " Well , then , forgive me , dammit . " He turned his silent eyes slowly on those about him . He tried to smile at Saul , his eyes flickered with fond amusementp230when he saw Father Sweeney , but they became chill when they touched Joan , and turned away . He saw Sebastian , and the last smile , full of tenderness , rested on the child . Then those searching eyes saw Lionel , and saw instantly what he had not known before  --  that here was Sebastian 's father . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of yellow in the agate eyes , the quickness of expression . But only Bernard knew , now , that Sebastian 's nature was neither his father 's nor his mother 's . He was complete in himself . Another tear formed at the corner of Bernard 's eye . He felt , with the acuteness of those who are dying , that the child was more of himself , and Jason , than of Patricia and Lionel . There was the " blood " of a spiritual kinship , the kinship of the soul . " Pray , God , and 0 Christ , and Blessed Mother , " was Bernard 's dying thought , " that my grandson never knows , never knows . " He looked at Saul then , and again tried to smile encouragingly , but his mouth sagged and could only grimace . A sudden anvil fell on his chest ; he could not breathe . His big body heaved , shuddered . His last glance was on Jason , and Jason never forgot that look , which seemed to pierce his very heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees , and so did everyone else , even Saul , and the priest began the litany for the dying . " Go forth , Christian soul . . . " Bernard 's soul flew to the God with whom he had always argued , and Father Sweeney was certain  --  as he thought later with a sad smile  --  that the Almighty was probably receiving another rebukefrom an innocent . And the priest was sure that God listened attentively and with divine understanding . Whether Bernard returnedthe courtesy was a moot point . After all , had n't our Lord himself asked his Father why he had forsaken his Son ? Saul whispered to himself , " Eli . . . Eli . . . Adonai . The Lord gives . The Lord takes away . Blessed be his name . " That night , as he lay alone , Jason thought : The cornerstone has gone from my life . And he was filled not only with sorrow but also with rage . He hated the thought that his brother would co-celebrate the requiem Mass with Father Sweeney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stared , even on his knees , with cold reproach at his grandfather.  |p231Today  was the first day of May , a day which Bernard would have welcomed as a " grand morning , and that it is . " Overnight the mountains had become almost summerlike , with a sky like a glowingaquamarine against which every tree was distinct . The distant Ipswich House was so vivid that one could almost count every pale brick and every chimney . It was half-past seven , and Jason had slept late ; he was usually up at six and would leave the house no later than half-past . He looked through his bedroom window at the narrow garden ; roses of every color were already in thick bud , and all the trees sparkled with life as green leaves danced in a soft breeze A dogwood tree offered her bouquets of white flowers . 1 like a bride , and three redbud trees glowed bright pink with masses of blossom . Peonies , like small cabbages , bobbed heavy pink and white heads as in greeting . Jason , somber though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of his sorrow for his grandfather and his growing hatred and desire for vengeance . He went into Patricia 's room ; she always ate breakfast alone , and in bed , and considered herself a partial invalidwho needed quiet and long hours of sleep . But the truth was that she wished to avoid Jason as much as possible and did not want him to see the enormous amount of food she ate . As he usuallycame into her room much earlier , she always pretended to be asleep , even if she had been awake for some time . She was not expectinghim this late and had just finished devouring a honeyed grapefruit , a large dish of bacon , two eggs , a mound of hot toast and butter , a glass of milk , and several cups of tea thick with yellowcream and several spoonfuls of sugar , and half a pot of strawberryjam and half a pastry . She still felt hungry . At ten o'clockp232she would eat again , and at half-past one would have a huge lunch ; then would come afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed she would have one or two thick sandwiches , cake , and at least two glasses of milk . She thought no one noticed her prodigious consumption of food , but all the servants did , though Jason did not know . She was always complaining of having no appetite . Despite all this , she was so thin that her collarbones were conspicuous , her arms and legs scrawny to emaciation , her body like a preadolescent girl 's . Her long face was very pale , and the attenuatedbones were sharply prominent , especially her nose . She lay peacefully back on her big white pillows lavishly edged with lace , and contemplated the last half of the pastry with contentment . But her eyes were not surfeited ; they were avid . Her scanty fine brown hair was braided in two meager plaits ; she wore a white nightgown of satin and cascades of fine lace and pink ribbons , and her slight breast hardly raised the shining fabric . She could not get her way with the rest of the ponderous heavy furniture in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had prevailed in her bedroom and dressing room , which were exquisitely furnished in the Louis XV style , all pale rose and blue and yellow , with an Aubusson rug in the same colors on the polished floor . The soft wind blew white lace curtainsback into the bedroom , and the blue draperies gleamed against the wall where they had been drawn . The wallpaper was a pale yellow , the color of daffodils , with a ceiling border of bluegreenivy . The expensive lamps were genuine cut crystal with white silk shades bordered in gold . Even in bed she was trim ; there were no wrinkles in her nightgownor pale rose quilted bed jacket . Nor was her braided hair untidy . The tiny pink ribbon bows at the ends of her braids looked freshly tied and neat . Her eyes widened with displeasure when she saw Jason . A slight flush appeared on her cheeks , and she hastily threw her napkinover the ravished breakfast tray . " I thought you 'd left by now , " she said . " It 's late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to her canopied bed , with its blue silk curtains edged with gold braid , and bent and kissed her cheek . She shut her eyes with distaste for a moment and then said petulantly , " I was awake half the night . " She averted herp233face from him and sighed . " I really must see Dr. Conners . Crises des nerves . " One of her novels of True Love and virginal heroines and fascinating but ruthless men was open on her bedside table . Jason looked at her with the devotion Bernard had thought grotesqueand degrading to Jason . But it was not the real Patricia whom Jason saw ; it was his mind 's image . He quite believed his wife had to " force " herself to " eat anything , " as she said , and he was always in terror that her " delicacy " would cause her imminent death . Had she been an early Victorian she would have had " the vapors . " Jason was certain that if she fell she would break like fine glass . Bernard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he shared his delusion with Patrick Mulligan himself . All others knew exactly what Patricia was , especiallyNicole . The servants jeered at her in the kitchen , and guffawed among themselves , but they feared her tongue , which could be endlessly shrill with recriminations . Jason and Patrick could not understand why the servants were always leaving , sullenlyor in tears , in spite of high wages . " Yes , lovey , " said the infatuated young husband , " go to Dr. Conners . Are you taking your iron pills regularly ? " He stood near her , humbly adoring and anxious . He saw fragile beauty where none existed ; he saw refinement which was not there , and a superb intelligence Patricia had never possessed . He had trembled to approachher on their wedding night ; he felt he was befouling a pure young nun whose thoughts were always ethereal . Patricia , with her shrewdness , had guessed this at once and so later had used this fantasy to escape her conjugal duty . When Jason touched her , she endured only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to him had been a cruel charade . She had gone alone after her anguished last meeting with Lionel , to the Inn-Tavern one afternoon , where she had found Jason supervising some servants in a corridor upstairs . She had urgentlywhispered to him that she must see him alone , and at once . Literally trembling , he had taken her to the end of the corridor and had waited for her to speak . He saw that she was very white , and that her eyelids were red and her manner distraught . He did not know that this was but two days since her " renunciation " of Lionel , and he was never to know . He only saw that she was in unusual disarray of both bod3 and emotions . He wanted , in dismay , to take her in his arms ancp234comfort her . He wanted to cry out to reassure her . But he could only stand in silence , ready to die for her if it could diminish her air of fright and distraction . Her shrewdness prevented her from sobbing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of scaring him , and she needed him . So she tried to control herself , forced herself to smile , though the smile was ghastly . She took his arm and drew him nearer to her , and now his trembling was visible , for he both worshiped and desired her . " You know Dada wants me to marry you , Jason , " she said , fighting for a beguiling tone of voice . His gray eyes were startled and imploring . " Yes , Miss Patricia , I know . He 's mentioned this a few times . " He could barely speak . " I . . . I could n't dare to hope , though . I do n't even dare now . " If Patricia had not been in such a terrified state , even she might have had compassion on him . She clutched his arm tighter . " I . . . I 'm awfully shy , Jason . I . . . I told Dada . . . you know , the calling of the banns for several weeks in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't bear it . I 'm . . . awfully shy . I shrink from people . I . . . yes , I 've always wanted to marry you  --  I knew what you felt for me . But I 'm so afraid of people . Even you . . . " He could not believe it . His dark handsome face turned very white . " Miss Patricia ! " he said . " Weeks of banns , " she repeated , hardly hearing him . " Weeks . And before that , an engagement period of not less than three months . Dada would say it was impropei for fewer . Perhaps he would insist on six months . And then , the wedding . He would n't have it private . . . you know . It would be a spectacle . " She thought of Lionel , whom she had dreamed would be her groom , she in a Paris bridal gown with a cathedral train and a misty veil and orange blossoms , and he adoringly beside her , kneeling before the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the choir solemnly rejoicing , and the cathedral  --  it would be in Philadelphia , of course  --  full of sunshine and flowers . The radiant vision shattered and tears filled her eyes , her color faded . She wanted to die for an instant , in her grief and despair . She shut her eyes and gulped . " Miss Patricia , " said the incredulous Jason , who could notp235credit this miracle . He put his hand over the hand on his sleeve ; it convulsed under his fingers , but she held on . " So , " she whispered , like one renouncing life and welcoming death , " let 's run away . . . to another town . . . and be married by a justice of the peace . Tomorrow . Jason , please . Please ? " " But your father . It would be wrong to deceive him , with all his plans . He would be very angry , you know , at both of us , running off like that , as if . . . as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " I would n't blame him if he were angry at us . It is n't fair to him . All his plans , his only daughter . Like a laborer and a shopgirl who had to . . . " He swallowed again . What did such a lovely innocent young girl know of hasty , forced weddings ? Jason 's eyes were pleading . He still could not believe this was happening . She clutched him tighter . " For my sake , Jason . Please . You do n't know how I feel about such vulgar displays . I love Dada , but he has n't any taste , or sensibilities . I . . . I would just die , Jason . A justice of the peace . And then we can be remarried before a priest  --  Father Sweeney  --  quietly , privately . It can be arranged . If Dada gets angry , it wo n't last . He 'll be so delighted . Believeme , he 'll be so delighted ! He 'll scold at first , and then be reconciled . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God 's sake , please ! " Even Jason , in his befuddled state , saw her terror . He did not understand it . But he believed in her shyness , her aversion to crowds . What a delicate girl she was , and how poignant . Overcome , wanting to protect and hold her and comfort her , he whispered , " How can we arrange it ? " " We can go on the train in the morning , tomorrow morning , and then back on the afternoon train  --  five o'clock . Jason ? Oh , God , Jason , say you will ! " The white tendons in her throat stood out under her skin . She thought of knives and blood and doctors and death , and of pain and shame and degradation . She became frantic . Now she clutched both of Jason 's arms , and he saw her wide eyes , the distendedirises , the gasping mouth , the desperate and frantic fear . Had he been less infatuated , he would have drawn back and wondered at such frenzied vehemence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep sigh of relief and leaned against him . Oh ,  |p236Lionel  , she whispered to herself . Oh , my Lionel , my darling . Jason'sstrong arms were about her . He hesitated , then bent his head and timidly kissed her ice-cold cheek . He tasted her tears . " Thank you , Lord ! " he murmured . He was like a grateful child whose fatherhad given him a gift after long suffering . He had no doubts , no hesitations . He was blessed . And so it happened . Even when the hastily bought wedding ring was on Patricia 's finger , in the dark study of an indifferent justice of the peace , Jason could not believe that Patricia was his bride . He was in a daze all the way back to Belleville on the gritty train . He tried to hold Patricia 's hand , but she pulled it away . Shy little girl , thought Jason with compassion . Patrick , after his first rantings , was elated . He kissed Jason on both cheeks , and tears brightened his bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jase ! Stealing my little colleen right from under my nose ! What a scandal ! " He shook his big head . " And what 'll people say about all this ? Running off . Well , now , what 's to do ? We 'll see Father Sweeney . In the meantime , it 's no valid marriage , I 'm thinking , justice of the peace ! Off with you , Jason , back to your grandfather . Until you 're properly married to my child , in a month or two . Only right . " But Patricia , counting the weeks of her pregnancy , wildly refused to let her bridegroom leave her . Again she was frantic . Patrick , who could deny her nothing , finally consented . Patricia and Jason spent the night in the best guest room of Patrick 's house . Bernard , at home and unaware of the marriage , said to himself , " Good . The boy 's out for once . Let him enjoy himself . " Patricia thought she had suffered before , but this night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ; when the need had previously arisen , he had sheepishly gone to Mrs. Lindon'shouse and had been ably serviced by one of her young " nieces . " He had no way of knowing that Patricia was no virgin on her wedding night . He only knew that she cried in his arms , shaking sobs of despair and sorrow . He thought it quite natural , even when , at last , she repulsed him . But his love and desire and tenderness were finally too much for her , and she knew this had to be , for her own sake , and Lionel 's . But as she submitted , she thought death might have been preferable to this , after all . When Jason had done and the ecstatic passion and joy and wonder had left him for a while , he felt that he had committed anp237unpardonable crime in taking this holy girl . He wanted to cry , to beg her forgiveness . She only lay rigid , sobbing quietly , and then turned from him . He thought that natural , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told Bernard the next day . He was bewildered at Bernard 's horror , outraged by his oaths and condemnations . Did n't Jason know that marriage was not entered into lightly , but was a sacrament ? And , that girl . . . She was n't a one he would choose for Jason  --  had he been daft , then ? There was that lovely girl Molly , always in the house , visiting Joan , though it was plain to see it was Jason she wanted . Jason swore . Molly ! The estrangement began then , only to harden at the birth of the " seventh-month " baby . But Jason , standing diffidently by his wife 's bedside this May morning , could only think how unusually fortunate he was to have such an extraordinary wife and delightful children and a father-inlawwho doted on him . He said to Patricia , " If you 're unwell today , Patricia , stay in bed and rest . Your health is not too good , you know . " " I think I 'll take your advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no intention of canceling her luncheon engagement with some young ladies of " the best families . " They had Bristol cream sherry , and Patricia , who would never indulge in " strong spirits , " drank vast quantities of that sherry , which lifted her pain for a few hours and made her laugh senselessly . That she was becoming the object of talk among her friends , who listened eagerlyto the alcohol-released confidences , and that they gossiped among themselves when she was gone , she did not know . But never did she speak of Lionel except in passing and in cautious indifference . Of Joan , his wife , she said much , and all in malicious ridicule . " That cripple . " She was certain that Lionel had married Joan on " the rebound " after her own " renunciation " of him , and out of gentle pity or probably Jason 's pressure . So she consoled herself , but was not reconciled . After leaving his wife , Jason went to the nursery , where his children were finishing their breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an infant Queen Victoriain her small chair at the table . Sebastian , who had a precociousmind , was reading a book . When Jason entered the room , Nicole was saying to her elder brother , " It 's not polite to read atp238the table , Bastie . " ( It was a nickname to which Patricia objected , it having vague invidious suggestions . ) " And , Nick , you use a fork with your omelet , not a spoon . You 're not a baby now . " Jason was amused . The children ran to him , Nicholas breathlesslybabbling and flailing his arms , Nicole sedate as always , and Sebastian with a shining expression of love . Jason kissed them all . He lifted the heavy Nicole in his arms , where she immediately said , " Tsk , " and brushed off a minute thread of lint from his broad shoulder . She then devoted herself to correcting the placementof the tight black tie under his high , stiff white collar . This occupied her completely , it would seem , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little heart was sentimentally awash . She felt that her father and her brothers were children who would disintegrate except for her attentions . The nursery was filled with warm sunlight and pleasant cretonnefurniture and blackboards and toys and braided rugs-all Patricia 's doing . The scent of new-cut grass floated in on the light breeze . Miss Flowers , their nursemaid and governess , looked severe . She was always disputing with Nicole , who had very definite opinions about the correctness of all things . " A damned little old woman , " Miss Flowers would confide to the other servants . " Obstinate . Always interfering . " Nicole gave Jason a very damp kiss just before he put her down and lifted Nicholas , who was clamoring for attention . Then , gravely , he shook hands with Sebastian in a manly fashion . " Be good , children , " he said as he prepared to leave . " They will , " said Nicole with strong emphasis and a quelling look at Nicholas , who was still clamoring . " Quiet , please , Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister as he obeyed no other . She had a hard hand which was always in readiness , even for Sebastian , whom she dearly loved . All her feelings were adult and measured and astute . " The little colleen has a lot of common sense , " Bernard had said of her . " She 'll niver make a mistake , if she can help it . All rules and regulations . A proper tartar . " He would laugh and think again of his grandmother who had survived the Famine by sheer willpower , even though very old at the time . " Nickie 's a sergeant , " he would add . " Worse than my own , " and laughed when she had corrected him , respectfully but firmly . He once said to Jason , " It 's not reincarnation I believe in ,  |p239though  the Jesuits do , but if I did , I would say the little one is the reincarnation of my grandmother . " I 'm really blessed , thought Jason as he got in his car in the convertedstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wife like no other , remarkable children , and money . If only Da had lived . . . He drove a very large Packard of a brilliant red , which Patricia thought vulgar . She preferred her dainty electric automobile , which did not smell or snort or backfire , and which had a polished black elegance like an expensive buggy . The morning was beautiful , but Jason 's spirits became darker as his car climbed the road . He had an unpleasant task to do this morning , and nothing would ease him unless he accomplished it . Like many of the Irish , he did not forgive , but bore great grudges when his sense of justice was outraged . He paused for a moment to contemplate Ipswich House and to remind himself that but for him it would not exist and he would still be impoverished . For only an instant he was gratified . The door was opened for him and he entered the great flagged hall , then proceeded to the offices at the rear of the left wing . Lionel , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was outside , and so was Daniel Dugan 's Cadillac . It was to Daniel 's office that he went , and his face became more set as he proceeded . Daniel 's office was discreetly lavish , and expensive , with black lacquered furniture , cool white draperies , and a white rug . His secretary , a young man , was taking dictation . On seeing Jason , Daniel said good morning and dismissed his secretary . Jason sat down , looking formidable . " Well , " he said , " I got your message , and here I am . What do you want to say ? " Daniel calmly lit a cigar and leaned back in his chair , studying Jason . " Let 's be reasonable , " he said . " Dennie Farrell has more than repaid Saul Weitzman . He thrashed his sons . Let 's look at the law  --  " " Damned to the law , " said Jason . " I want those bastards sent to prison . " His voice was rough , edged with emotion . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old Joe Maggiotti , who had been murdered  --  " or they 'll soon be trying to kill other people . " " They did n't kill anybody ; they did n't even try , " said Daniel . He frowned at his cigar . " I know how you feel , Jason , and I do n't blame you . But let 's not get feelings mixed up with facts . They are young , still  --  "  | " They committed an adult crime , " said Jason , his face growing darker by the moment . " So they should be punished as adults . They killed my grandfather . Are you forgetting that ? " " They did n't set out to do that . It is n't even manslaughter , according to the law . He was an old man and had high blood pressure . I talked to Dr. Conners , and he said he had told your grandfathera year ago not to get excited . " " Those bastards excited him . They caused his death . " Daniel said , " Mr. Garrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you go ahead with your plans . I 've heard the boys are sick over what happened to him . " " I will make them sicker , " said Jason . " You 'll make yourself resented , or ridiculed . And it will be remembered that your grandda brutalized them before their father even arrived . " Daniel added , " People are becoming soft over childrenthese days . " " Yes , " said Jason . " I know . They are going to be an example . " Daniel shrugged . " I can only give you my advice . Let it drop , Jason . " He spread out his hands . " It 'll come to nothing . " Jason stood up . " Yes , it will . I 'll use everything I can . And Mr. Mulligan is with me . There are ways . . . " Daniel said , " With the law , or without it ? " " What the hell does it matter ! " Jason shouted . " One way or the other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , his enraged gray eyes , his clenched fists . He said , " Just be careful , Jason , be careful . " " Careful , shit , " said Jason , and stamped out of the office . We Irish never give up , thought Daniel . And perhaps that 's good , too . Jason went to his own office near Daniel 's . Though equally lavish , it was more somber than the other 's , all heavy polished furniture and dark rug and deep maroon draperies . He found Father Sweeney and Dennis Farrell and the latter 's wife , Kathleen , and Patrick awaiting him . Jason wasted no time . He looked at Dennis and said , " I am going ahead today and have your sons arrested . " Mrs. Farrell , a little plump woman with fair hair and sober clothing , began to cry . Her face was blotched with earlier tears and her eyes swollen . Her husband stood beside her , his hand on her shoulder.  | " Yes ! " shouted Patrick , his small eyes dancing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ! " Father Sweeney said , " Jason , please listen to Dennis a mo-ment . " Jason swung on the parents . Dennis ' narrow dark face was twisted in an expression of pain . He patted his weeping wife 's shoulder . " I 'm not listening to anybody , " said Jason . " Justice is justice . My grandfather is dead , Farrell , because of your sons . They 're going to prison , no matter what I have to do . " " Yes ! " said Patrick . " It 's about time , with the spalpeens the way they are these days . " " You 're going to have them arrested , Mr. Garrity ? " said Dennis . He sighed . " You 've got to catch them first . " " What the hell do you mean by that ? " Dennis said , " I 'd give everything I have to know where they are , my sons . They did n't come home Monday night . The next day I went to where they work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a whole month . A whole month . Not one day . But they brought home their usual . . . wages . " Jason frowned and was silent for a few moments . Then he said in a changed voice , " Where did they get their money ? " Dennis turned aside . " They stole it . There 's been robberies in the neighborhood . I think that 's where they got it , but the police do n't know yet . " He drew a deep breath , almost a moan . " I do n't want to get the police yet . I want them found . I 'm their dada . " He took his hand from his wife 's shoulder . " Mr. Garrity . I wanted my lads to go to the nuns ' school . But Kathleen here said they were too strict  --  corporal punishment . So , off they were sent to the public schools , where the teachers ca n't whip the kids anymore . Ca n't force them to behave . No discipline . When Mike was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , they 've got them now  --  that I beat him when he was bad . Only , he told the stupid bitch that I beat him when I was drunk , and I took the pledge twenty years ago ! She came to the house flourishing papers in her fist , threatened me with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children . God damn . Never whippedmy lads unless they needed it , and Kathleen pleading for them even then . Only children , ' she said . A man is n't a child after he'sp242twelve . The Jews say that  --  only , it 's thirteen with them . So do we , when a kid 's confirmed . But tell the mothers that , these days ! " He turned on the priest . " Father Sweeney ! What are you telling the kids ? Why are n't you giving them hell ? " The priest said , " Dennis , we do our best . But the secular school boards are interfering , and we 're afraid . They 're trying to put parochialschools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . That 's what they want . If I were more emotional , I 'd say it is a plot . " " It is , " said Patrick . " Old Bernard told me . He gave me books to read . " He snorted . " Separation of church and state . That 's what they 're muttering . And where in the blessed Constitution is it said that God should be outlawed from education ? Does n't Congress open with prayer to Almighty God ? Was n't all our colleges , and all public schools , opened under religious auspices ? " He turned to Dennis . " You should have sent them to the sisters ' school . " " Yes , " said Dennis . " Kathleen , stop crying . It 's too late now . " " The nuns are so strict ! " Kathleen sobbed . " Whipping the children . I remember , meself . " " It did them no harm , " said her husband , and now his voice was harsh . " Where are my lads ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . But her husband turned to Jason , who had been listening with a strange expression , and not with belligerence . Dennis said , " Do n't think it was you who made them run away , Mr. Garrity . They just knew I 'd find out about them . " Again his face twisted and his hard realistic black eyes filled with sudden tears . " My lads . I tried to teach them . Wa n't any use . What 's got into the children these days ? " Jason said , and it was involuntarily , " What ever gets into men ? It 's always there . Da told me . It just needs to be set loose , and it 's being set loose now . " " Deliberately , " said the priest . " I hear reports from the sisters . " Jason went to his large window and looked out at the glowing early-summer gardens , filled with a tumult of flowers and swaying trees and green grass spreading everywhere . How long has it been since I noticed it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It came to him that he really had no peace in himself , andp243he did not know why . I have everything  --  and perhaps I have nothing , he thought . Then something mysteriously changed before his eyes . The gardensbecame more intense in color , and seemed to possess a meaning , something he had once known but could not remember . He only knew that the scene before him moved closer , surrounded him , and it was filled with love and passion and grandeur and the authority of a Law beyond the law of man . A tremendous light appeared to have fallen on the gardens , dazzling , overpowering , trembling with portent . Then he , too , felt small and affrighted , but exultant . But the adversary remained . However , Jason was stirred with compassion . God had no pity on men . It was man 's duty , then , to have pity on his fellows . He turned back to those in his office . He said to Dennis , " And you do n't know where your sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My lads ! " wept Kathleen , and now her husband turned to her . " Do n't worry , Kathleen . They 'll come back when they 're hungry . " " They 'll go to jail for stealing ! " she wailed . " And they'lr be punished . It may save them . " Jason doubted it . He said to Dennis , " Let 's hope so . I . . . wo n't do anything against them . Perhaps I 'm wrong . The thing is to get them back . I 'll offer a reward . . . " Would old Bernard have done that ? Jason asked himself . Then he remembered what Bernard had once said : " We 've got to stop men from corrupting men . Break the bloody chain . " With surly reluctance he had added , " And return them to God  --  if he 'll have them . Better still , to the Blessed Mother . She understands . Her Son , I 'm thinking , has too much on his mind . "  |p245Patricia  dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put on a brown silk dress with a hobble skirt bordered with a wide band of brown satin at the hem and at the waist . The neck was bordered in the same fabric . Her slippers were of the finest French kid , also brown , with simulated spats of light tan with brown buttons . She looked at herself closely in her long pier mirror , and was satisfied . She had been told often by her father that she was a beauty , called enchanting by fortune hunters , and was adored by Jason . Aided by her own self-love and the flatteryof the local tradespeople , she could find few flaws in her appearance . She saw , not a very ordinary young woman in her mirror , but an apparition of taste and seductiveness . If she had one regret it was that she was still too slender , for while Lillian Russell'svast breast and large hips were not so stylish now , plumpnesswas still fashionable in women . Patricia opened a locked drawer , to which only she possessed the key , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given her a long string of gold beads which reached to her knees , and to match , her father had given her a bracelet of the same beads , three rows of them , and a pair of yellow-gold earringsset with big topazes . She put them all on . She then finished her costume by setting her wide brown hat , with the yellow silk roses , down over her brow and putting on brown silk gloves and a brown silk cape . After a final satisfied glance in the mirror , she went dutifully to the nursery , which was on the third floor , where she found her children in the brightness of their playroom with the scent of new grass blowing through the windows . Miss Flowers sat at a tablep246with Sebastian and Nicole ; she was teaching the boy in an irritable voice as shrill as Patricia 's own . Nicole sat quietly , listening , sometimes turning the pages of her picture book . She already knew many words in it . Miss Flowers disliked both children for different reasons  --  Sebastian had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which disconcerted her , and Nicole , never a hypocrite , was frank in her critical stare . If Miss Flowers had a favorite , it was Nicholas , who was restlessly pushing a red toy train over the polished floor , making puffing noises like a small engine . Disheveled as usual , he darted his restless eyes everywhere , but without interest . Seeing his mother , he jumped up , shouting , throwing his arms wide , his Buster Brown rompers slipping down to his hips under the long belted tunic with the sailor collar . " Careful , dear , " said Patricia as the child embraced her thighs . But she was pleased by his noisy greeting , and she preferred him over his twin , whom she lovingly called " my old lady . " Nicole stood politely , tidy as always , in a tight maroon frock with a starched pinafore . Her brown hair was curled by a hot iron every day  --  duty of Miss Flowers  --  but the curls did not shine . They were topped by a flaring butterfly bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , but it was strange that she never saw the real beauty of the magnificent gray eyes , clear and shining as pond water , depthless in their expression , lucent and thoughtful and perceptive . Sebastian also stood at the table , his face impervious . He knew he would not receive a kiss from his mother , and probably not even a smile . He had trained himself not to feel too much pain . A sunbeam struck his brown hair and made a reddish halo over its curls and brought out yellow sparkles in his eyes . He was aware that his mother had a profound aversion to him . He had persuadedhimself that it was because of some defect in his character , and he was always trying to discover what it was . Sometimes he was quite overwhelmed by guilt . If his mother did not love him as she loved his brother and sister , then it was his fault . As Patricia affectionately adjusted the bow on Nicole 's head , the child studied the mother 's attire ; she thought the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , and rattling as it swung . But as Papa had given it to Mama , it did not receive a word of criticism . She looked at the simulated spats , and her small thick nose wrinkled disapprovingly . Patricia 's heavy scent dis/comfited her . But she smiled amiably at her mother , for she was a courteous child by nature . Nicholas , in the meantime , was excitedlyjabbering about the new train , and tugging at his mother 's arm for her complete attention . " You 'll wrinkle my cape , sweetheart , " she said , patting him on his hot twitching cheek . But he clung to her as a squirrel clings to a branch swinging . " Mama ! Mama ! " he shrieked . " It 's got a bellting-ting ! Ting-ling ! Look , look ! " His agate eyes , so like Patricia 's , bulged . " Wonderful , dear , " said Patricia with genuine fondness . Such a delightful little fellow , so lively , so endearing ! So unlike . . . Her glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of cold malevolence . Here was the cause of her never-ending sorrow , her unassuaged grief , her thwarted hunger , her renunciationof the only creature she had ever passionately loved . His insistence on being born would never be forgiven by her , for he had destroyed her happiness and left her wedded to a man she often detested or , at best , contemptuously endured . Her love for Lionel was as tumultuously alive in her as ever , and this intruder had parted her from all she had ever wanted . Sebastian saw that malign glance and looked aside , his young heart trembling with pain . Patricia said nothing to him this morning . She kissed the twins gently , told them to be " good , " and smiled at Miss Flowers , a small wiry little woman who Patricia sometimes thought resembled a starved bird . The governess smiled in an attempt at friendliness , though she had nothing but envious scorn for the other woman . Such an idle , useless , silly thing , with her airs and graces , and so unworthily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicole , young as she was , was sorry for her mother even though she did not know why . Acute of eye and mind , she only knew that Patricia was always tense and nervous and without ease , especially when her husband was present . After Patricia had left , Nicole sat at the table again , and quickly leaned across it and patted Sebastian 's hand in a motherly gesture of comfort . " Stop that , Nicole ! " cried Miss Flowers . " Your brother is difficult enough without your pampering ! Sebastian , are you being deliberately stupid , or is it natural ? " Nicole said with staid calm , " It 's you who 's stupid , not Bastie . " " Do n't you call him Bastie ' ! " shouted Miss Flowers with fury.  | " Your mama does n't like it ! What a disobedient , obstinate child you are , to be sure ! Perhaps that 's because you are so plain ! " Nicole smiled ; her little face suddenly bloomed with dimples , and the gray eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Miss Flowers seethed . " Never mind , " said Nicole . " I know I look like a liver dumpling . " There were times when she could be quite tolerant . " You 're lovely , " said Sebastian with a look of devotion . " Your eyes , Nickie  --  they look like one of Mama 's crystals . All shiny . " Nicholas rushed to the table , banging against it and causing the books and papers to leap . " Nickie ! Play with my train . " He jumped up and down , and tugged at his sister 's arm . She looked down at him like an indulgent mother . " Run away , Nick , dear . I 'm busy with my book . " Nicholas promptly thrust out his arm and swept books to the floor and shrieked . " Nickie , come ! " Nicole sighed . She climbed down from her chair , picked up the train , and followed by her leaping brother , went into his bedroom , carefully closing the door after her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trial you are , " she said , and began to play with the toy . Nicholas flung himself on his knees , screaming with excitement , and pushed the train up and down on the polished floor while Nicole watched with bored affection . But Sebastian needed quiet for his lessons . She thought about her mother and frowned . She hoped Mama would n't be too " tired " after the luncheon with the ladies . Nicole knew all about Patricia and had developed her own euphemisms . Patricia went slowly down the long and narrow staircases . The house was not totally quiet . Even the May sunlight was bleak and flat here , as it was stringently admitted through the little windows . Though the day was warm , the air in the huge house was chilly , and Patricia shivered . Black depression crept over her like a fog . She was not yet twenty-seven , but she felt that her life was over . Her eyes filled with tears . On the last step of the stairs she hesitated , shivering . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally opened a cabinet and helped herself to a large glass of Patrick 's potent burgundy . She swallowed slowly , her eyes closed , waiting for the warmth to gather in her vitals . When it did , at last , she went to the garage for her electric automobile and drove away.  |p249The  Schofield house , where her new " best friend " lived , was not far away , and Patricia trundled there in a warming haze . ElizabethSchofield was a small blond girl , five years Patricia 's junior . Elizabeth 's parents lived in a very modem house , " Greek restoration , " all white brick with white pillars and tastefully furnished , which inspired both Patricia 's envy and admiration . What Elizabeth'sfather did was a subject for speculation in Belleville . He had " offices , " but what his occupation was , no one seemed to know exactly . It was enough for Belleville , however , that he was apparently rich and had a number of servants and a fine new Cadillac , and his wife , a fashionable woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked child , at once innocent and evil , and her gossip was charmingly malicious . Winking at the other young ladies after Patricia had had two small glasses of sherry , she would add a large measure of strong bourbon to the succeeding ones . Patricia 's subsequent indiscretions at the luncheontable proved unfailingly amusing . She would always refer to Jason as " that oaf I 'm married to , " and tell of his more private ineptitudes . A luncheon with Patricia served for giggling discussion for at least a week . Oddly enough , Elizabeth 's father would listen attentively , and often question his daughter with shrewdness . Patrick Mulligan and Clementine Lindonwere the only ones who had some idea of Mr. Schofield 's activities . Clementine would refer to him as " that confidence man " to her dear trusted friend . But Mr. Schofield was a regular visitor to her establishment and so she would say nothing more even to Patrick , who was under the impression that Mr. Schofield was a legal thief . Daniel Dugan , his nephew , was less amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . He merely watched alertly . He had heard of Mr. Schofield in Philadelphia and New York . Mr. Schofield had offices there , too , equally as ambiguous . What he was doing in this backwater was a matter on which Daniel speculated to himself . Patricia rarely remembered her return home ; she only knew that she was sleepy and relieved of her chronic suffering . She would leave her automobile in front of the house , stagger inside , sway up the stairs to her room , and there throw herself on her bed to fall into a heavy slumber . A few hours later she would awaken in a state of fierce hysteria with recriminations of all and sundry , particularly her father and her husband . There would be an odorp250of Sen-Sen about her . Strangely enough , neither Patrick nor Jason was suspicious . Patricia was careful . Her clothes were always neat , even if her face was drawn and haggard and her eyes red and sore from tears unconsciously shed during her drunken sleep . She never recalled what she had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant . As for Patrick and Jason , they would murmur together solicitously about Patricia 's tenuous health and her too-acute sensitivity , and treat her with tenderness . Each morning , on his rounds at the resort , Jason went into Lionel 's office , where he was always greeted with the old smiling affection . Only lately had a peculiar flicker briefly appeared in Lionel 's lupine yellow eyes . It was not there all the time , and Jason never noticed . Jason dutifully inquired about his sister , Joan . As always , Lionel 's face lighted at the mention of his wife 's name . Joan was splendid , even after five years of marriage . Joan was faultless in every way . Jason listened with a smile . He liked Lionel 's offices , even if unlike his own . They were spare but attractive , all gleamingwood floor and light airy draperies and brass electric lamps . The room held an astringent if agreeable odor that seemed to emanatefrom Lionel himself . Jason sat down , a massive figure in his mourning black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to smokinga pipe , and he leaned back in his swivel chair and contemplatedthe smoke . Because of the warmth of the day , he had removed his coat and sat in his fine percale white shirtsleeves , though he had not loosened his narrow red tie , only a few shades darker than his fiery hair . His black silk vest , patterned and rich , was neatly buttoned , and a gold watch chain twinkled over his stomach . Despite his snub nose and freckles , his native appearance of compact elegance had increased greatly . His hands were quick and restless and stroked a folded newspaper on his desk as he talked with Jason . " We 're having a little trouble again , I hear , with Mr. and Mrs. Adrian Schlecter , Jason , in Suite 5-G . " " Yes . I found a sheaf of their complaints on my desk this morning . I 'm getting exasperated with them . We 've told them over and over that they ca n't bring their little grandsons here except at Christmas . I 'm about ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I showed them what the oldest grandson did to the cabinets in the living room of the suite , and what another one did to the expensive French wallpaper in his bedroom . Only dear littlechildren , ' Mrs. Schiecter said , with that foolish grin of hers . She did n't offer to pay for the damage , though . I reminded her that we had made a concession in letting those damned kids here for Easter , and that she could not entertain them again . She then accused me of not loving the little ones . ' " " They 're our most generous guests , " said Lionel thoughtfully . " And they have the most expensive suite and stay here most of the year . They give good tips , too . " " We 're running a hotel for adults , " said Jason . " Except at Christmas , we do n't want our guests annoyed by kids . The IpswichHouse is regarded as a retreat . " Lionel laughed . " Especially for gentlemen who 've had enough of their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never at ease even with these discreet arrangements . " What the hell , " Patrick had said . " Jase , it 's not our business , provided they behave themselves and act . . . decorously . Is that the word ? Yes . A gentleman has a right to bring a female guest , if the gentlemen and the ladies always occupy separaterooms and are sufficiently discreet . If they . . . ah . . . visit their friends in their rooms , whose affair is that ? " Patrick had chuckled . " Human nature . You 'll never be able to outlaw that , Jase , not even with the blue laws here . Anyway , they always leave the bedroom or sitting-room doors open . " " Until midnight , " Jason had said . Patrick had coughed . " Well , they do n't want their neighbors to be disturbed by . . conversation . Besides , over half our guests are legally married . " " Even if they seem to have a new wife every year , some of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and had smiled . " People talk , Mr. Mulligan . " Jason still called him that . " It does n't keep the guests away . I have n't heard our shopkeeperscomplain , either . " He had patted Jason 's shoulder . " Never mind . The new hotel we 're building will be a family onerugged and simple . Come on , Jase . This hotel here is a happyplace . " " I feel like a whoremaster , " Jason had grumbled , and Patrickp252had laughed . " Irish priggishness , " he had commented . " We may all be devout Catholics , but there 's a lot of Calvinism in us , too . That makes sin even more interesting . " Today Jason said to Lionel , " Mrs. Schlecter has another complaint . She said their neighbors were roistering all night and kept her and her husband awake to all hours . When I checked , I found there were two married couples quietly enjoying an after-dinner drink together in their sitting room . At eight o'clock . But Mrs. Schlecter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dear carolingbirdies , ' as she says . I told her that other neighbors object to her singing at four or five A.M. Before God gets up . She then said something about sinful people wasting God 's blessed time . " " I know , " said Lionel . " She has tried to wheedle the room-servicewaiters to bring breakfast for her and her husband at five , an hour before the kitchen is even open . I suggested she have sandwicheswrapped to take upstairs after dinner , and she agreed , then wanted a hot plate to make coffee in her room . That , I said , was forbidden . I 'm more tactful than you , Jason . I said the fire departmenthas rules and we ca n't violate them . " " I 'm ready to throw them out . " Lionel examined his pipe . " They bring at least six other couples here , friends , who come here every year with them . That would be a loss of several thousand a month , if they all marched out and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My business is feeding the guests . Just do n't be too rigid . " While Jason fumed , Lionel opened his newspaper . " Look at this , " he said . " Just when we wanted to install oil heat instead of coal , Washington warns  --  they 're always warning  --  that our oil resourceswill be exhausted by 1930 . And coal soon after . " " We should heat with wood ? " Lionel chuckled . " And here 's another thing . Natural gas , according to them , is already running short . I 've noticed the heat did go down several times in the gas stoves this winter . Another funny thing . When my men went down to the markets this morning for supplies , they were told the last delivery of sugar , meat , and butter was a third less than two weeks ago . And they were offered grahamflour instead of the white . They could n't get a full supply of ham and bacon , either . " Something stirred darkly in Jason 's mind , something old Ber/nard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The railroads are n't on strike again . " " No . But it 's funny . Well , probably nothing to worry about . Time we got back to work . " Jason encountered Daniel Dugan in the lower hall . Daniel smiled at him and said , " Carrying the world on your shoulders again , Jason ? " Jason shrugged . He still did not trust or like Daniel . They exchanged a few casual remarks . Daniel said , " We 're doing better business this year than last , for this time of the year . But prices of everything are going up , I see . " " They usually do , " said Jason , and went to his own offices . The glory of the May day was no longer glorious to him . He sat thinkingat his desk for a long time and came to himself with a heavy feeling of depression . What was it that Bernard had said long ago ? " Taxes are garnered for wars , and that 's really the thought behind that new Sixteenth Amendment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars and tyranny . Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse . That 's the way the big boys get power  --  through wars and taxes . Power bought with blood and confiscation . I know my history . " Well , thought Jason , taxes wo n't bother me . I 'm not a rich man . And war with whom ? America wo n't ever engage in foreign wars . We 've got too much sense . And Washington 's too small and feeble to push us into one . Jason settled down to the papers on his desk . More and more guests were arriving every day . Even in his distant offices Jason could hear the hubbub of new arrivals and the sound of automobileson the drive . He worked steadily until six , when he was interrupted by the assistant manager , who did all the hiring and , when necessary , the discharging . Edward Griswold was an earnest young man , dedicated to his employers . There was something celibateabout him . He talked only business , and conducted his work in privacy , usually without consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologetically at his door and then entered . " Mr. Garrity . We have a problem . " " When did n't we have ? " asked Jason wearily . He wanted to go home for dinner . The day had been arduous . It was his duty to greet the more important guests on arrival , and there had been a number of them today and there had been some dissatisfactionp254about assigned rooms and suites . Jason , never at ease , as was Lionel , had had to keep his temper , and that had been hard . " What do you want , Eddie ? " " We advertised for a first-class cook , " said Mr. Griswold . " Old Emil , our best , has given us notice for the first of June . We put advertisements in all the newspapers , in Philadelphia and New York . " He paused . " Only the best , we stated . Experienced in French cooking . We have an applicant , only one qualified . The others were . . . well , not up to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reading of Victorian novels . " You have a qualified applicant ? Well , why do n't you hire him ? What has it to do with me ? That 's your job , Eddie . " " That 's the problem . " He fell into gloom . " The only one qualified , and he has references from Delmonico 's and the Waldorfin New York , excellent references . The only thing . .. I 'm afraid everyone in the kitchen will quit if I hire him . " " What 's he got ? Leprosy ? " Jason was impatient . He looked at his watch . Mr. Griswold did not smile . " No . He . . . he 's a Negro , Mr. Garrity . I felt I could n't hire him without your approval . " Jason vividly remembered some of the old signs in Belleville , and there were still some : " No Irish . No Catholics . No ForeignBorn . " His gorge rose . " Send the man in . " Mr. Griswold , after an astonished stare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slender and stiff of demeanor , entered . He was very black , very distinguished-looking , with fine features and a haughty glance . He was dressed like a rich gentleman in black silky broadcloth , and with a diamond pin in his tie . His hair was thick and smooth . There was a diamond ring on his finger . He stood in silence before Jason 's desk , and the two young men studiedeach other for a few moments . Then Jason said , " Do n't you have an ass , and knees ? Sit down ! " The young Negro hesitated , then sat down , crossing long legs . His feet wore polished boots . " Your name ? " asked Jason . The other ceremoniously reached into his pocket and brought out a card case . He slowly removed a thick cream-colored card and presented it to Jason . It read : " Edmund Patterson . Chef Supreme . Cordon Bleu . " His eyes challenged Jason , large lustrous black eyes with lashes as long as a woman 's . The engraving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you 've worked in New York and Philadelphia , Mr. Patterson . " " Yes . For a number of years . " His voice was mellifluous and tinged with an English accent . " Before that , in Johannesburg , South Africa , where I was registered in a gourmet cooking school . " " I see , " said Jason , who did not . He was becoming irritated at the other 's manner . " You were born in South Africa ? " " Yes . " The man 's hauteur increased . " I belong to the Bantu tribe . But . . . I am a Zulu . " Jason was more at sea than ever . " Zulu ? " " We Zulu men are the best chefs in the world . We are not like the Bantus . " Jason leaned back in his chair and found himself broadly smiling . But the other man simply stared at him with a slight affront . " You were a chef in Johannesburg . What , may I ask , did they pay you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equal to dollars . " Jason whistled . " That 's a lot of money . And . . . in New York and Philadelphia ? " " About the same . . . sir . " " We pay our head chef  --  I mean , cook  --  two thousand a year , Mr. Patterson . " The young Negro 's face held instant disdain . " Possibly not a good chef . Or a chef at all . " " We 're not a stylish town in Belleville , Mr. Patterson . How did you get here ? " " I saw your advertisement in the New York Times . I like New York , sir , but my wife , Sue Ann , does n't . I met her four years ago , when I was attending a convention in New York . She 's a fine dressmaker , and employed four women . She was born in New York . We have two children . Sue Ann wants to live in a small town . For the sake of our children . She visited once , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked with sudden desperation and in masculine confidence . " Sue Ann has a very strong will , and she is afraid to bring up children in New York . A bad influence , she says . Sue Ann  --  she can be very assertive at times , like all Zulu women . Yes , she is Zulu too . I wanted to return to Johannesburg , where men like myself are respected for their accomplishments . But Sue Ann is an American , and refused to leave . " He sighed . " Ip256was much appreciated at Delmonico 's . I was offered much more money if I would remain there . " " Women can be difficult , " said Jason , trying not to smile again . Mr. Patterson sighed . " Yes . Ca n't they ? I should have put my foot down . I did try . But Sue Ann put two feet down . " Jason looked through his window reflectively . " America is a very prejudiced country , Mr. Patterson . " " No more than elsewhere , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't understand prejudice . " Jason looked at him with concealed amusement . " You 've said you are n't like the . . . the Bantus . " " Indeed not ! Very ignorant people . We Zulus have a proscriptionagainst intermarriage with them . We have our own apart-heid . " Jason struggled with his amusement . " I 'm afraid you ara very prejudiced man , Mr. Patterson . " " There is such a thing as not intermingling with your inferiors , sir . " Mankind , thought Jason , is congenitally stupid . He said , " And what makes a man inferior to other men ? " " It 's a matter of intelligence , sir . " " Well , on that I agree . You speak like an educated man . " " I 'm a graduate of a university for the Zulus in Pretoria . " The musical voice was rich with pride . " I speak English , French , and Afrikaans . " Negroes , reflected Jason , did not attend universities in America , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy in Belleville , Mr. Patterson . We have only about half a dozen Negro families here . " " I am a Zulu ! " Jason waved his hand . " That is a distinction white Americans wo n't understand . " " I 'm willing to try . If I may ask the salary ? " " Two thousand a year . " " Impossible . I am willing to start for three thousand , for one year , and then an increase . " He brought forth references from the Savoy Hotel in London , from Delmonico 's in New York , and another from Philadelphia , one of the best restaurants . Each was laudatory and expressed regrets that Mr. Patterson was leaving . Jason studied them . He said , " You wo n't find good accommodations here . "  | " I will build my own house . I have catered , too , in the best establishmentsin Johannesburg and New York . My own house , in South Africa , was a very nice one . " " It wo n't be easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " But you , perhaps , sir , would not understand that . " Jason suddenly lost his temper . He leaned forward in his chair , and his eyes were bright with anger . " And how would you know that , then ? I am Irish . My people suffered through a famine . We are under English rule , and the English treated us like dogs with fleas because of our race and religion . When we rebelled , our women and children were beaten on the streets by English soldiers ! And raped . My grandfather 's little sister was hanged because she tried to defend her faith  --  a little girl , Mr. Patterson ! My people died of hunger in the cities and on the roads and in the country . No one helped us . We suffered for centuries . . . " Jason'sbreath came heavy and fast and his face was engorged with rage . Mr. Patterson listened with astonishment . " It 's a long and terrible story , " said Jason . " Too long to tell you now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . Most of us were n't admitted , for we were suffering from consumptionand famine fever . We were left to die  --  men , women , and children  --  on the docks of New York . We who survived lived in caves , in the winters , in Central Park . No one would employ us , or if we were employed , we were paid very little  --  so little that we starved again . We thought we had come to a free country ! Free , hell ! Ca n't you read ? Almost all factories in America  --  still  --  have signs on them : No Irish . No Catholics . No Foreign-Born . ' We 're pariahs , outcast , and we are still despised . For many years no one would rent to us . We lived in hovels . What do you know about this , you with your fine university , your education , your large salary , your grand clothes . I tell you , the slaves in the South were better treated than we Irish . And better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . And the hate still exists . What do you know ? " He threw himself back into his chair , and his face was swollen with anger . " Not too many years ago a fine old man , an Italian , was murdered in this town , a poor old man who had a shop near where I lived . Only a few weeks ago a poor Jewish shopkeeper was attacked  --  right here . My grandfather died protecting him.  |p258Only  a few weeks ago . And you say I would n't understand ! Let me tell you this : I am a man . You are a man . We have to deal with human evil all our lives , without whimpering . Or , we are n't men at all . " The young Zulu 's face had changed , become shocked , moved . He said in a low voice , " Forgive me . I did n't know . " " It 's time you did , " said Jason , and coughed . " Here in America , in Belleville , we lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother , my brother and sister , and I. My old grandfather worked until the day he died . My mother died of consumption . There was no money to cure her , to feed her . We had to fight . . . Well , never mind . But unless we are born fortunate , all of us , we are going to suffer from our dear fellowman . Learn that once and for all , Mr. Patterson . " After a moment he said in a drained voice , " You 've got to get over your own prejudices , Mr. Patterson , as do ye all . " Then he said , " Unlike you , I never attended a university .  --  ' ve worked hard since I was a young child . Do you know that until a very few years ago children in America were forced to work in factories and mills , even mines , when they were as young as five and six ? Tens of thousands died of injuries , of starvation or disease . No one cared ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Zulu swallowed convulsively . In a humble voice he said , " I did n't know anything . I 'm sorry , sir . Would you like a glass of water ? " Suddenly Jason wanted to laugh , but without mirth and only with bitterness . " No . But I should like some whiskey . Have a glass with me . " He got up , and discovered he was trembling . He went to a cabinet and brought out two glasses and a bottle of bourbon . He filled the glasses and lifted his . " To humanity , and may God 's wrath visit it ! " " Amen , " said Mr. Patterson , and drank . Jason said , " Wait here , " and left the room . He went to the kitchen . The evening meal was in preparation and the huge kitchen was full of steam , delicious odors , and hurrying men . Jason lifted his voice and shouted , " Everybody stop ! I have something to say ! " It was rare for the manager of the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jason said , " I 'll make this short . I have just hired a chef , a real chef , to take charge of all the meals here . He is a Zulu , a black man , an African , and he has worked in thep259best restaurants in the world , in South Africa , London , New York , and Philadelphia . He has class , as you 'd say , and education . You 'd call him a nigger . I call him a superior man . " Now , if any of you 'd like to quit , say so now . You wo n't get work at the salaries you get here . In fact , you wo n't find jobs at all if I can help it , and I can . Understand that right now . If you make Mr. Patterson 's life miserable , you 'll answer to me . You will be working under Mr. Patterson . " Well ? Are you going to quit ? " There was a deep sweltering silence in the room , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stepped forward , a Hungarian . " Mr. Garrity , " he said , " you do n't need shout at us . We got good jobs here , yes ? We like this place . I do pastry . We treated right here , by everybody . We work with this . . . this black man . Yes . " He turned to the others . There was another silence . Then some said sullenly , and some with smiles , " Yes . Yes . " Then all were laughing and shaking their heads as they went back to work . Their attitude now was that Mr. Garrity had been absurd . Jason returned to his office . He said to the Zulu chef , " It 's all right . You can start tomorrow , if you want to . But there 's one thing you have to know , Mr. Patterson . Every man in that kitchen thinks he is better than any other man there , and far superior in every way . That 's human nature . If you look for slights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't insult them , either ! "  |p261Jason  went to the little Holy Cross cemetery on his way home , in the last brightness of the May day . He stood at Bernard 's grave , which was still raw , though little tufts of wild grass were already sprouting on it . The mound had not settled yet . When it did , there would be a large marble cross on it . The cemetery had that strange eerie silence only graveyards have , as if filled with watchingeyes and sentient presences . Where was Bernard now , if anywhere ? It was as if he had never lived , that ferocious and gallant old man . Jason said aloud , " Da ? " Was this all that was left of a heroic life , of any human life  --  a mound of brown wet earth ? For what was a man born ? For what did he endure living ? For what did he die ? The earth was one vast tomb , and there were no answersfrom it . Let priests expound , explain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even afraid . Jason got into his automobile and went home . He had but one life to live and he would live it as best he could . Still , he thought , I am blessed in many ways , with my dear wife and my children and my fortune . I could have nothing . He tried to lighten his mood , and forced himself to think of his new Zulu chef and finally could smile . No matter a man 's race or color or religion , he was one with the rest of his wretched fellows , and they all had one terrible adversary  --  God . And each other , of course , sad to say . The house was very quiet except for the sounds in the kitchen and the voices of servants . Jason went upstairs to his wife 's room . He found her , as he did so often , fast asleep on her bed . She had removed only her slippers . Her fine hair had fallen over her face . Her arms were flung out as if pleading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . She looked lost , sprawled on her bedp262in her brown dress . One topaz earring lay beside her , and Jason picked it up and put it on her dresser . He then stood and gazed at her tenderly , his darling , his fragile wife . She was so ineffable , so easily hurt . He still could not believe that this delicate creature had married him , with all her daintiness and feminine emotions . His smile was almost humble . She had no strength , he reflected , no endurance , or she would not be so tired this often , so enervated after a mere lunch with friends . Everything , it seemed , exhausted her . The fine hair puffed up and down with her irregular breathing . She would have her regularmigraine tonight . Patricia moaned ; then , as if feeling Jason 's eyes on her , she started awake . She sat up , swaying , loAed at her husband , and pushed back her hair . " Oh , good heavens , " sheII ! murmured . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She clutched her temples . " Oh , what a headache I have ! And I 'm sick to my stomach . " Jason went into her bathroom , and , as usual , mixed her a dose of Promo-Seltzer . She drank it greedily , licking the last drops from her dry lips . She averted her eyes from him , and her mouth became sullen . " Shall I ring for tea for you , dearest ? " asked Jason . Patricia shuddered . " No . " She smoothed her wrinkled dress and yawned abruptly . " You should have stayed in bed , as you promised , " he said . " I did n't promise . How tiresome you are , Jason . You expect me to spend my whole life in this awful house and go nowhere . Not that there is anywhere interesting to go in this town . " She found one of the rats which bolstered up her hair in the latest Irene Castlefashion ; it was under her elbow . She pushed it under a slight buttock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you stay in bed tonight ? " asked Jason . " You can have a tray up here . I 'll call Joan and say we wo n't be there for dinner . " Patricia gave him a glance that was purely vicious . " Oh , you would like to imprison me here all the time , would n't you ! Never seeing anyone but you and my father and my children . What fun ! What time is it ? Seven ! Oh , do go away and let me get ready . Joan is expecting us in half an hour . " She and Jason had dinner with Lionel and Joan once a week , and that occasion , combined with Joan and Lionel 's weekly visit ,  |p263was  almost all Patricia lived for with real happiness . All the days between meant nothing to her . To sit in the presence of Lionel  --  and to watch him " suffer " too  --  was to know hours of meaning and painful joy . " Are you sure you are well enough to go ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " We were out late last night with Daniel and Molly . " " Oh , how I did enjoy that ! " Patricia cried , and slapped the pillownear her vindictively . " Daniel and Molly ! I ca n't stand either of them ! Daniel 's sly and Molly is stupid . They have no conversation : And Molly watches me all the time . Like a thief . And then she looks at you like a cow , all big eyes . Everyone knows she was in love with you . It makes me laugh . " " Molly ? In love with me ? Patricia , that 's ridiculous . We 've never even liked each other . " Jason laughed . He was amazed at the very thought . " Well , she was , and probably still is . In a way , I 'm sorry for my cousin , marrying such a vulgar unattractive thing as Molly . He could have had the best in Philadelphia . I could never understand it . Oh , do go away , Jason ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was shrill , and she shrank when Jason lovingly touched her brow . Jason went away , to see his children . He found Patrick romping with them . Nicholas was swinging from one of his arms in a monkeylikefashion , and shrieking , Sebastian was standing nearby , smiling , and Nicole was holding his free hand , smiling at him like a fatuous mother . Patrick was fatter and pinker and balder than ever . He resembled a giant Kewpie doll , paunchy and joyously smiling . His little bright blue eyes shone happily as he played with the children . They sparkled even more on seeing Jason , whom he loved dearly as a son , for all Jason 's " John Knox " convictions . To a jovial Irishman like Patrick , the " black Irish " were formidable , and could be daunting , especially to those of a more flexible bent . Nicole ran to Jason , and before she held up her short arms to him , she scrutinized him in her usual fashion , seeking his mood . She felt that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be awesome at times . He picked her up and she gave him a kiss , murmuring into his neck . The murmur was as consoling as the hand-pat she had given Sebastian this morning . Nicholas , yelping as customary , rushed to his father , bouncing upp264and down , demanding to be picked up too . Jason set Nicole down and took his wriggling son up ; Nicholas squirmed in his arms . Though it was cool now in the nursery , the child was sweating vigorously , his hair damp , his mouth uttering panting incoherencies . Sebastian approached but stood at least two feet away , and the man and the child smiled at each other in silence , the warm understandingflowing between them without words . Jason had the suddenthought that if he told Sebastian of his encounter with the new Zulu chef , Sebastian , even at his age , would comprehend entirely , and with sympathy . " Expected you earlier , Jason , " said Patrick . He thought it was a grand sight , the big dark man and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jason . " Oh , " said Patrick , and gave his son-in-law a sharp and searchinglook . So , the bucko had been annoyed or upset about somethingtoday and had gone to the grave for some comfort , then . Patrick waited for some hint of this , but Jason was disentangling himself from Nicholas ' fervid grip and it appeared to take all his attention . Patrick said , " And where 's Patricia ? " " She had a migraine , " said Jason . Nicholas clung to his knees , still jabbering . Then Nicole firmly pulled him off . " Enough , " she said . " Be quiet , Nick . " Instantly the little boy sucked in his breath and was still , though he gave the impression of vibrating like a struck violin string . " She gets them too often , " said the concerned Patrick . " Yes . I tried to persuade her that we should n't go to Lionel and Joan 's tonight , but she insisted . " " Always mannerly , " said Patrick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was fond of Lionel , trusted him and appreciatedhis acumen and many talents , but he did not like the beautifulJoan , with her misleading composure and apparent serenity . He did not find them soothing ; he had come to the conclusion that " that angelic lady has more to her than seems , and it 's not good , I 'm thinking . " He had guessed long ago that Joan had nothing but remote derision for Patricia , and this offended him . When Patricia was particularly inane , Joan 's heavenly blue eyes would seek out Lionel 's , and for an instant or two the expression in them was not so celestial . Patrick did not think his daughter inane ; he thought her childlike and trusting . Joan , he was now convinced , was neither ; once Mrs. Lindon had expressed her opinion to him thatp265Joan was spiritually corrupt , and though he had been horrified at this remark , he had lately almost come to believe it . Always moved by feminine beauty , he had told himself that Lionel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel , Patrick geniallyaccepted his corruption ; most men were so , except Jason , of course . The two men then remarked on the increase of early arrivals this year at Ipswich House . Jason mentioned Lionel 's information that food supplies had been short lately . Patrick frowned . " I wonder what 's up , " he said . " Heard the farmers were doing well , and there 's lots of beef and pork and butter . Maybe our suppliers have n't been ordering enough . " " Maybe , " said Jason . Miss Flowers then appeared to summon the children for their supper in the little dining room connected with the nursery , and so Jason had no time to express his amorphousuneasiness . " Tired , Jase ? " asked Patrick as they went downstairs together . " A little . The new arrivals were pettish , more so than usual . " Patrick chortled . " They always are . You 've got to have pa-tience . " " I 'm not as tolerant as you , Mr. Mulligan . " " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the bottom step he put his hand affectionately on Jason 's arm . " When you 're my age , nothing much will rile you . I promise . How was my darling Molly last night ? " " Astringent  --  as usual . " Patrick nodded . " Irish tongues , like knives . All Irish women have them . I love that colleen . Danny 's very lucky , for all her sharpness . But a great heart it is she has , a great heart . Lovely . " Patrick went into the dining room and Jason went to the library to wait for Patricia and to read his newspaper . He saw an inconspicuousitem : The French government had ordered early military maneuvers and were increasing the draft of young men . Britain had ordered ten new warships . The Balkans were again in an uproar , but then , when were they not ? Czar Nicholas had addressed the Duma yesterday in " a closed session . " But when were the Russians , always ambiguous and full of mystery , ever candid with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dardanelles at the government 's request . Well , the mighty British Empire was always vigilant . Nothing sinister there . The exiledp266Communist , Lenin , was in Germany at the present time , and so was his friend Trotsky . The German kaiser was not noted for his intelligence ; none of the Hanovers were , which included the presentKing of England , George V , another grandson of the late Queen Victoria who had not been particularly bright . To cover his uneasiness , Jason turned to more conspicuous items in the newspaper . The rift between President Taft and TheodoreRoosevelt was becoming wider . Teddy was roaring about the country giving flaming speeches concerning his " New Nationalism . " " I stand for the Square Deal ! " In Cleveland he had announcedthat he was a candidate for the presidency . He had scornfulwords for Elihu Root , who had " given " the nomination to President Taft at the Republican convention . The Progressive party , Teddy 's own , had nominated Mr. Roosevelt . Taft was incensed . " I have been a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - fervor . Politics , thought Jason . Roosevelt had dividedthe Republican party ; if he was not its candidate , then , by God , he would stop Taft . Wilson , thought Jason . He did not know why he felt a thrill of something like fear . Patricia then entered , pulling on her gloves , and he stood up . She looked fresh and glowing , he was happy to see . He did not know that the slight rosiness of her cheeks and lips was not her own , but had been applied with a careful piece of cotton . Only her eyes remained slightly reddened and swollen . The veil on her pink velvet hat mostly concealed this , however . She wore a very Parisian dress , which Jason had not seen before , of gray silk , tight of skirt , and draped with silver bugle beads over the bodice . She had put on her aquamarines , and a full capelet of white fox was flung over her shoulders . If her figure was too meager , she did have style and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving admiration . " How pretty you look , Patricia , " he said . " Is the headache gone ? " But she cried in anger , " Oh , Jason , how could you ! You did n't change ; still in that old black serge , and you have n't even shaved tonight ! " " What of it ? It 's only Lionel and Joan . No other guests to-night . " " But how insulting to your . . . host ! " " For God 's sake , Patricia ! I see Lionel every day , and he 's only family , as is Joan . "  | " You can be sure Lionel 's changed ! " Jason smiled indulgently . " Well , he 's always the glass of fashion , ' always was even when he had only two dollars to rub to-gether . " " He 's elegant ! " " Always was . " Jason held out his arm to his wife , but she brushed by him in a pet . She refused his help in getting into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt pulled up on her leg and showed the thin and nearly shapeless calf . Jason thought it indecent . Women 's fashions ! It would n't be long before they displayed their knees , and knees were unsightly objects . The long mauve twilight had settled over the little city , and the mountains had turned a dull plum . Patricia held her hat in the nimble breeze . " I do wish you 'd put up the top , Jason . That wind is blowing my hair about , and if my hat was n't pinned on , it would blow away . " She smelled of lilacs and face powder . Jason was silent ; he was listening . In the distance an organ-grinder was grating out an unfamiliar air . It had a sorrowful and poignant sound . " You know music so well , Patricia . What is that tune ? " " Oh , Jason , you are so ignorant ! If only you would go more often to concerts with me in Philadelphia , and the opera . But no . Always business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she a cripple . " Patricia paused , seething again . " That 's the Miserere . " " Miserable ? " said Jason , controlling his temper . " Not quite , for heaven 's sake . It 's a mourning song , in a way . The Catholic Church uses it sometimes , at a different tempo . A sort of tolling . " A mourning song . Jason listened , and it seemed to echo the pain in his chest . The city darkened ; a lamplighter was running about like a cricket , attending to the streetlamps . The houses Jason drove by looked shut and ominous . What nonsense . He was seeing omens everywhere . There was no sound just now but of that majestic , slow , and lost music echoing through the quiet streets . Jason felt cold . He was in no mood for Lionel and Joan tonight . He thought of his grandfather and the old shack on the derelict street where he had spent his wretched childhood . All at once that little house seemed , to Jason . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I mean by that ? he thought . He had never re/membered it before without gloom , but suddenly it possessed peace , in spite of the hunger and dire poverty . " I suppose you did n't even notice you got a letter today from your brother , the priest , " said Patricia . " It was on the hall table in the tray , where all mail is put . " " Jack ? " Jason considered . " No . I just passed the table . I did n't look . " " You are the most unobservant person I ever knew ! Really , Jason . Do slow down . We are approaching their house . " They were now in the newer part of the city , quite close to the mountains , which had become black shadows against a darkly starred sky . Patricia looked about her with her usual umbrage and envy . Every house was new , modern , attractive , set on wide lawns with old trees which had been carefully preserved . The houses were not mansions ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called it . But they had no wooden fretwork , no tall narrow windows , and , in most cases , no verandas . That was the latest style  --  no verandas , no porches . They had a light look , which Jason thought seemed impermanent , even frivolous . Well , it was a new age ; things did change . The Nolan house was set back from the street , which was wider than the older streets in Belleville . Mr. Schultz ' architect had been consulted by Lionel and Joan , and the building was handsome , of pale rose brick with white doors and shutters . The front door was embellished by shallow wide steps of pale polished stone . On each side was a slender wooden column , painted white , which gave the house a slight Regency air . The windows were quite large and glimmered with the light of two or three electric chandeliers . Patriciathought of her father 's house and almost cried . What a struggle she had had to make Patrick install electricity ! " Harsh ? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaslight still , so smelly , so dangerous ? " A neat little maid of some fourteen years opened the door . She wore a black dress and a frilled white apron and cap and had the innocent face of a young colt . Jason smiled at her , but Patricia rustled past with a haughty uplifted face as if the girl was not human . Lionel came into the hall , smiling , in a dark gray suit excellentlycut , his lean figure like that of a ballet dancer , his red hair smoothly combed into glistening waves , his gray tie pierced by a modest diamond pin , his linen immaculate . At the sight ofp269him Patricia 's heart lurched , as always , with deep pain mingled with aching joy , and her lips trembled , remembering . The little maid took her hat and her cape and Jason 's deplorably battered fedora . " Lionel ! " said Patricia , as if it had been years since she had seen him . She gave him her hand . He held it for a long moment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . He pressed her fingers , then turned to Jason and struck him affectionatelyon the shoulder . " Nice night , is n't it ? " he said in the most beloved voice in the world to Patricia . Her face was transformed ; it had become so radiant that she was almost pretty . While Jason and Lionel exchanged some casual remarks , she stared at Lionel fixedly , until Lionel became aware of her gaze and , taking her elbow , led her into the parlor , where Joan was waiting . Here was no heavy mahogany or walnut furniture . It was all delicate French reproductions , upholstered in pastel colors , the lamps of crystal or subdued gilt , the rugs good if imitation Aubussons , the draperies airy and fresh , and spring flowers everywhere in crystal vases . There was a faint flowery scent in the warm air , and apple wood burned in the marble fireplace . An exceptionally fine print of a Madonna and Child hung above the mantel , on which stood an ormolu clock . In a lady chair near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robe embroidered in gold . She looked like a child perched there ; her masses of gleaming black hair were knotted in a classical fashion , but tendrils had escaped to frame her perfect face , giving her an aspect of innocence and defenselessness . But there was nothing defenseless in the large dark blue eyes . They were keenly aware and observant . Her little white hands were folded in her lap . Lionel , on his wedding night , had been delighted to discover that Joan 's legs were not twisted or shriveled , but due to Kate 's assiduousmassaging were perfectly formed and round and white , even if small and without strength . They could have belonged to a child , the knees dimpled and smooth , the toes rosy . Patricia , even as she kissed Joan 's cheek , was filled with resentment of her sisterin-law'sdazzling appearance , and seething with envy of the house and its furnishings . " What an exquisite dress , " said Joan in her soft and fluting voice . " Paris , no doubt . "  | " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At least , thought Patricia , it was more expensive than that robe she 's wearing . Belle-ville ! Joan smiled . She never talked very much ; her features were expressive enough , but she never revealed her emotions or thoughts except to Lionel . She said , " And how are the dear chil-dren ? " " Splendid , " said Patricia . " The twins are adorable . Nicole said to me , yesterday , Mama , you 're more stylish than the ladies in Harper 's Bazaar ! ' She sees so much , the dear little thing . At her age , too . And Nicholas ! He is so artistic . He draws all the time and colors with crayons . Miss Flowers says he 's very gifted . An artist in the family ! I always wanted to paint , to do something cre-ative . " Joan 's mouth lifted in a gentle smile . " And Sebastian ? " The smile was somewhat malicious . Patricia 's face changed , became almost ugly . " Sebastian ? Oh . He does well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do hope he has all his wits . So unlike the twins . He never chatterslike Nicholas , who just bubbles with ideas and observations . Did I tell you what Nicholas said to me a week ago ? " " I believe you did , " said Joan . " He is always talking , is n't he ? " Her tone was neutral , but Patricia flushed . How she hated this miserable cripple who had stolen Lionel on the " rebound " ! It was just like her to favor Sebastian over the twins , Sebastian , who rarely remarked on anything and who was so very sly . One never knew what was in his mind , if anything . Come to think of it , thought Patricia , annoyed , he resembles his dear auntie , Joan . How I should like to tell this cripple that she is n't his aunt at all , but his stepmother ! The thought made Patricia smile , and the smile was not attractive . Joan saw it and perceptively had an idea what had inspired it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her heart , never attuned to anyone but Lionel , and now Sebastian , was not calm at all . What could this fool know about the dear child , that most loved child ? Joan felt that Sebastian was her own , for he was Lionel 's , and the thought of him under Patricia'sinfluence angered and outraged Joan , though her face remainedinscrutable in its smoothness . " Sherry , Patricia ? " Lionel was saying . Patricia seated herself on the other side of the fire and lookedp271up at Lionel , and he was embarrassed at the slavish adoration of him in her eyes , her attempt to communicate that adoration . " Alwayssherry , " she said . " I take nothing stronger , you know . I do n't approve of it . " Lionel nodded . " Joan ? " " Whiskey , love , as usual , with a very little water . " Patricia wrinkled her nose in a condescending fashion . Lionel , who knew all about Patricia , added whiskey to the sherry . Then Lionel poured whiskey for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little distance . He had kissed his sister mechanically . He was no longer enchanted by her . He thought his friend Lionel could have done much better than Joan , who could not be a real wife to him . He would have been amazed , and aghast , to know of Lionel 's and Joan 's passionate and intoxicated couplings , the ecstasy , the joy , the becoming of one flesh , body , and spirit , the profound rapture and sweetness , the unshakable faithfulness . He had never known this with Patricia , and suspected there was something missing in his life , but he did not know what it was . He was convinced that true ladies possessed no passion . That was reserved for immoral women , of whom he knew almost nothing . Lionel sat near Jason . " I heard , before I left the office , that you had hired a nigger as chef , " he said . " I thought that was Griswold'sjob , and that he would report such an applicant to me . I do have charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason 's mouth tightened . " True . You do have . But Eddie had looked for you . You were n't around just then , and this needed immediateattention . " He paused . Jason hated to confront anyone with unpleasant facts , especially not Lionel , who was like a brother . " And I am manager , you know . . . friend . " He regretted the mimicry immediately , but he was disturbed tonight and did not quite know why . Lionel made an eloquent gesture of submission . Joan had heard this , and while she smiled at Patricia , she began to listen . " Patterson has credentials of the very best , " Jason continued . " We 're lucky to get him . " " I read them , after you 'd left . " " Then you know . " Jason 's deep voice became hard . " And I object to Patterson being called a nigger . ' He is an educated gentle-man . " " But a Negro , just the same . "  | " What the hell has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I remembersomething Saul Weitzman told Da , that the Jews were admonishedto treat the stranger in their midst with kindness , for you were strangers in Egypt , also . ' " He paused . " Coming down to it , we 're all strangers to each other . Da used to say that no man had a friend , and I 'm beginning to believe it . " Patricia had heard . She exclaimed , " Oh , that awful old Jew ! He caused your grandfather 's death , Jason ! Have you forgotten that ? " Jason said , " We all cause each other 's death one way or another , " and was astonished at himself . He was beginning to sound like Da , and then he smiled . I hope so , he thought . He said , " Da left all the money he had in the world to Saul  --  eight hundred dollarshe 'd stashed away in his famous tin box under his bed . Da knew what he was doing . " " Senile old man , " said Patricia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , " said Jason . He was rarely annoyed at Patricia , but tonight he was . " And it was n't Saul who caused Da 's death . It was two young criminals . " " Just children , " said Patricia in a sentimental tone . She assumed a maternal gentleness , all soft smirks and tilted head . " No one is a child , " said Jason . " Da used to quote the Holy Bible . A child is evil from his birth and wicked from his youth . The heart of a child is deceitful . ' Or something like that . I 'm beginning to believe that , too . " Lionel laughed . " I 've known that since I was a kid . I remember my thoughts even when I was five years old . Nasty . Purely evil . Well , coming back to our new chef . I heard you bullied the kitchen cooks into compliance . " " I did n't threaten them . I told them they had to act like men , or quit . I also warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a very high opinion of himself , probably deserved . " Jason paused . " But that does n't give him license to patronize the other help , either , and I made that plain . " There was a subtle charge in the air . Jason rarely exerted his authority and had never done so before to Lionel . Now he had a cold , threatening appearance , and even Joan was impressed . A peculiarflicker appeared in Lionel 's yellow eyes as he looked at Jason , and for the first time Jason became aware of it and was confused . He knew Lionel was secretive , but this was different . It was affectionate , that flicker , but it was also enigmatic . Jasonp273could usually read Lionel , but now he could not . Lionel was looking into his glass with a disturbing thoughtfulness . What a dolt my brother is , thought Joan with contempt . And to think he is over Lionel ! It 's outrageous . Lionel replenished the contents of the glasses , moving with his usual foxlike grace . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two other guests tonight . " " Oh , no ! " cried Patricia , giving her husband an accusing look . " And Jason did n't change ! " " Who ? " asked Jason . " Mr. and Mrs. Chauncey Schofield . " Jason frowned . " I 've heard of him . How did you meet him ? " " At the house of friends . " " Wonderful people ! " exclaimed Patricia , giving her dress a quick look . " Rich . Sophisticated . Cultured . From Philadelphia . I met them when I visited their daughter , Elizabeth . " " If they 're like that , what are they doing in this backwater ? " Jason asked . " I had the impression  --  I do n't know where I got it  --  that there 's something fishy about Schofield Enterprises . What does Enterprises ' mean ? " Lionel grinned . " Only he knows , exactly , but they seem to have a lot of money and they bought a very fine house . We 've been there . He dabbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finance , enterprisesof all sorts which will make him money . He invests in them . " Jason repeated , " What is he doing in Belleville , then ? Nothing here to interest him . " Lionel shrugged . " He thinks Belleville has a future . " " Very interesting people , " said Joan . " Perhaps Belleville has possibilities after all . Mr. Schofield has offices in New York and Philadelphia . " She smiled . " Perhaps he likes this backwater . " " Patricia 's friend Elizabeth is n't really his daughter , " said Lionel . " He 's only about thirty-two , not much older than we are . His wife is at least fifty . Old enough to be his mother . I think she is the one who had all the money to begin with . A rich widow . He used it , I suppose , to make money for himself . " " I 've heard about men like that , " said Jason , and was surprised to discover he was being disagreeable . " Opportunists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible womenp274for their money . Mrs. Schofield is fortunate that he has n't run off with all of it . " Lionel laughed , his very endearing laugh . " She has good lawyersin New York , who administer her late husband 's estate . And she 's not as foolish as she seems . She burbles on like an idiot and is infatuated with Chauncey , but I think there 's some cunning in her , too . He 's a very attentive husband , and a charmer . And a good father to Anita 's daughter by her first husband . She takes Chauncey 's name . Elizabeth is a beauty and she 's only ten or so years younger than Chauncey . He has a great influence over her . " " Lawyers or no lawyers , Mrs. Chauncey and her daughter had better watch out . " " You 're being uncharitable , " said Lionel , grinning . " Ah , I hear the bell . They 've arrived . " He rose and went to greet his guests . Patricia looked at Jason inimically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . I 'm beginning to think you married me for my money , yourself . " Jason colored , but he had no words to reply to her . He could only say , " Now , Patricia . " But he was wounded . He could never make Patricia understand that he had loved her from boyhood . She would only shrug . What did she really want ? He was always trying to please her , always giving her gifts . She was never satisfied . She accepted everything as if she were doing him a favor . " Besides , " said Patricia with loftiness , " why should n't a man marry money ? Why should he marry a pauper ? " And she looked at Joan , who was highly amused . Patricia fingered her jewels . Her gown no longer pleased her . She remembered that Mrs. Schofield was always magnificently dressed , and with better jewelry . Patricia was feeling her liquor . Jason waited , fuming . He was prepared to dislike the Schofields even before meeting them , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge people before knowing them . But there had been something tonight . . . For some unrelated reason he was rememberingthat odd flicker in Lionel 's eyes . Jason could hear a man 's rich , mannered voice in the hall , accompanied by a woman 's high-pitched rush of greeting . She was expressing , Jason supposed sourly , her joy on encountering Lionel . The man with her laughed ; it had an unctuous sound , and then Lionel spoke and it was his " public " voice , as Jason had once called it with mingled amusement and impatience . I 'm cer/tainly in a fine mood , he thought , and I think it is all the fault of that damned conceited stuck-up Zulu . He glanced at Patricia ; he was always glancing at her . She was listening avidly , already adjustingher society expression of pleasant politeness . Poor girl , so shy , so diffident  --  it was difficult for her to be with strangers for long . Jason suddenly glanced at his sister . She was watching him with a faint smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him , and he thought , as he had thought years ago with humiliation , that Joan regarded him with disdain . The new guests , led by Lionel , were entering the room , and Jason got to his feet . Joan thought how ponderously he moved now , and how rumpled he was , and how unkempt he looked with that faint blue-black shadow of a beard . How different he was from Lionel , who was all grace and lightness , and who appeared years younger . Jason looked intently at Mr. Schofield , and he knew what Lionel had meant when he had called the other man " a charmer . " He was very tall , almost as tall as Jason himself , and as lean as Lionel in his black broadcloth suit , impeccably tailored and obviouslynot from Belleville . He had broad fine shoulders , and his linen was beyond any criticism . But Jason noticed , with distaste , that his jewelry was a little flamboyant , including a little-finger ring with a diamond just a carat too large . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also too conspicuous . Yes , a confidence man . Jason studied his face . It was large and smooth and tanned and of an extraordinary handsomeness . The nose was strong , the mouth was full , humorous and expressive , with a somewhat heavy underlip . But it was his forehead that fascinated Jason , for it sloped down like a shelf over dark brown heavy eyebrows , so that those brows seemed pressed too closely to the eyes . Under that ledge , his green eyes , unusually large , were active and compelling . His brown hair was full and had been cleverly trimmed . He wore an air of extreme assurance and strength . Jason could understand why women would adore him , and even men would be attracted to all that healthy charm . He had a way of looking frankly and openly at others , as if he had never had anything to hide in his life , and it was a warm look intimating that he found nothing but friends in the world and was himself a sincere friendp276to all mankind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white . Yes , thought Jason , a mountebank if I ever saw one , and the hairs on the back of his neck bristled . His wife , Anita , was obviously his senior by some twenty years . As if she knew this was evident , she assumed a girlish vivacity and manner , all animation and flutterings , much smiling and laughter , and much fast chatter and breathlessness . She was of medium height and very tightly corseted so that her plumpness was wellrestrained , giving her a rather nice figure in its elaborate evening dress of silver satin and lace . Her bosom was full , as were her hips , but the waist was not bulky , again due to the corsets . She had a round babyish face , with cheeks like ripe peaches under a skin only slightly webbed with little wrinkles , round blue eyes like a staring child 's that mirrored a child 's candid greed , and a mass of golden hair whose color was suspect . She glittered with a diamondnecklace , diamond earrings , a diamond bracelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joan was a demure Mona Lisa in her blue velvet gown and patrician aura , and Patricia was quite extinguished , like a brown hen . " Oh , my darling angel ! " cried Mrs. Schofield , running to Joan as fast as her hobble skirt would permit . She gave Joan 's cheek an audible kiss , and Joan endured it with one of her sweetest and most affectionate smiles . " You look too heavenly for this bad , bad world ! As usual ! " Patricia had risen and was waiting . She had lost her style and appeared awkward , like a schoolgirl caught among adults , improperly dressed , and embarrassed . Mrs. Schofield became aware of Patricia . She flung out her hands to the younger woman , and Patricia timidly took them . " Dearest Patricia ! " proclaimed Mrs. Schofield . " Elizabeth told me how sweet , positively ravishing , you looked at luncheon . You 've been so kind to my poor lonely little girl for the three years we 've been here . So kind ! And introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're so grateful . " Joan watched this with her faint smile . Patricia was overwhelmed . Mrs. Schofield was always cordial , but she was exceedingherself now . " It was nothing , " said Patricia , flushing with gratification . Her voice was barely audible . " Everyone loves Elizabeth . "  | " Yes , do n't they ! She 's so ingenuous , so artless , so confiding . No guile at all ! Like a baby . " Mrs. Schofield patted Patricia 's thin shoulder , and looked about her , gasping with all her efforts . Lionel had already introduced Jason to Chauncey Schofield and was busy preparing a glass of whiskey for the latter and refilling Jason 's own glass . What a foolish woman , Jason was thinking . Or is she ? Jason remembered the lawyers in New York who guarded her inheritances . Then he caught the expression in those round blue eyes , and he changed his opinion about the intelligence of the lady . Here was no fool ; there was a cunning awareness behind the apparentlygullible face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . She and her husband were well-matched , and she was at least as crafty as he . Whatever business they are up to , thought Jason , she 's an able partner . He approached the lady . " I must be invisible , " he said . " Nobody 's introduced us . I 'm Patricia'shusband , Mrs. Schofield . " She broke into a blazing smile . " Anita ! " she cried . " I 'm Anita to my friends ! " " And I bet you do n't have an enemy in the world , " said Jason with an honest look . Joan turned and studied him sharply , and then bit her lip to keep from smiling in appreciation . " Oh , you are so kind ! " burbled Mrs. Schofield . " The whole world is so kind , really , this great , wide , beautiful , wonderful world , as the song goes . " " Give love and you 'll get love , " said Jason , and again Joan bit her lip . Patricia regarded her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . " True , only too true ! " cried Anita . She clapped the palms of her hands together in rapture . " You are a dear man , Mr. Garrity . I 've heard so much of you from Lionel and Joan , so much . " " And all of it flattering , no doubt , " said Jason . " Indeed ! " Now she was regarding him closely . Taking my measure , thought Jason . She said , " What a handsome man you are , sir ! I do like big manly men . And you have a look of power , so attractive to poor women like me . We ca n't resist you . " " Do try , " said Jason , and Joan suddenly put her fingers over her mouth . Patricia was even more astonished . How could Mrs. Schofield really be interested in Jason , who had no polish , no cul/ture or formal education ? But Mrs. Schofield was probably just being gracious and amiable , as always . Lionel had been listening intently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened . Mr. Schofield was also studying Jason with enormous concentration , and kept a smile on his face , even though suddenly convinced that Jason was not quite so stupidas Joan had intimated . Chauncey , whose business was the manipulationof others , became cautious the more he scrutinized Jason . Lionel was right . There was more to this bumbling Irishmanthan appeared to the casual eye . The Irish might be violent and sentimental and quick to take offense , but there was somethingdisconcertingly deep about them . Lionel was Irish , too , but he was quite open in his villainy when it came to business . He had said of Jason , " Do n't underestimate my brother-in-law when you meet him . He could disagreeably surprise you . " Anita 's right , thought Chauncey . There is a look of power about him . Bitter power . And he looks older than he is . " He 's a man of principle , God help him , " Lionel had said . " But far from a lump . He was a trusting kid when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him later . I do n't know what it was . He 's hard to know now ; even I ca n't always figure him out . I 've even suspected a latent ruthlessness . But he 'd never do anything he 'd consider dishonorable . " " Ah , " Chauncey had replied . " Men like that can be easily fooled . " " Well , good luck , Chauncey , but do n't be too confident . " Chauncey had given Lionel his wide-eyed sincere look , and then they had laughed together . The little maid appeared and in a frightened voice announced dinner . Joan said , " Corned beef and cabbage . And boiled potatoes . Jason loves it . " Jason looked at her incredulously . He had not eaten this since his mother had died , remembering , with pain , his birthday party and Kate 's fever-flushed and loving face . Mrs. Schofield clapped her hands in delight . " I love it , too ! " Patricia , who loathed it , said eagerly to her friend 's mother , " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfited Jason and made him feel vaguely ashamed for her . The large dining room was brightly lit by a very expensive crystalchandelier with electric candles . The furniture was an expert reproduction of Sheraton , and there was a genuine lace tableclothp279and much silver , crystal , and fine china . Jason was bemused . He had watched Lionel pick up Joan in his arms as if she were a child . He had seen Joan put her little arms softly about her husband'sneck ; he had seen them look deeply at each other , forgettingeveryone else . Joan 's eyes , so transparently blue , had gazed into Lionel 's for a long moment and her face was suffused with an unearthly light , and Lionel had looked back and there was a tremulousnesson his face . Jason had always believed that only the good could love profoundly , but now he saw love in all its tremendouspassion . Patricia , he thought , never gazed at him like that , and coming down to it , he had never responded the way Lionel had responded to Joan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no one else in the world but each other . God might be love , he commented to himself , but it seems Satan can love , too , and perhaps more abundantly , and with selflessness . Lionel tenderly deposited Joan at the foot of the table . They touched each other 's hands before Lionel went to the head of the table and waited until the ladies had been seated before seating himself . Mrs. Schofield was on his right ; Patricia , his left . Then the men sat down and Jason felt as if his weight would crush the delicate chair under him . Suddenly he hated this house and did not know why . He wanted another drink , and not wine , and a slight film of sweat dampened his forehead . The dinner might have been plebeian , but it was served superbly , and everyone talked pleasantly and laughed . But Jason felt danger in the atmosphere , as if inimical eyes were watching , and waiting , and all directed at him . He tried to divert his thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel had house expenses , which Jason did not . Patricia had her own large income , left to her by her mother , but Joan had married with very little , and that given to her by Jason , who had had not much himself then . For the first time Jason wondered how Lionel could handle the big house and the maid and cook and the new automobile . Debt , probably , he thought with gloom , for he himself had the austere Irishman 's detestation of debt . He became more and more uneasy . He kept glancing at Chauncey , and said little himself . The food reminded him of his grandfather , and his pain increased . Da , he thought , I wish to God you were here , and perhaps you could tell me why I feel so wary . Why was I invited tonight with these strangers ? He did not yet suspect Lionel of ulterior motives ; hep280did not doubt Lionel 's affection for him . Lionel was exigent , and had always admitted it , but his dealings with Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken advantage of his friend . He might be devious with others , but never with Jason . Until now ? Jason became deeply depressed . He found a fresh glass of whiskey at his elbow . He drank it gratefully . Patricia gave him an admonishingglance , but he noticed that she was drinking the wine , and that her voice had risen to a higher and more insistent pitch , and that she was laughing too much and looking only at Lionel . Jason turned his head and saw that his sister , who was next to him , was amusedly watching Patricia , and the amusement was not kind . Jason became angry . He glared at Joan , and feeling his look , she turned to him with a smooth inquiring face . He looked away . His glass was miraculously filled again , and he lifted it . Then he felt a cold warning in himself , and he put the glass down . He turned his eyes to Chauncey and Anita . They were too urbane , too easy , too casual  --  were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What had Chauncey Schofield to do with Lionel ? He was not a man to waste time , Jason had judged . " Enterprises ! " Jason caught Chauncey 's attention . " Just what are ' enterprises ' ? " he asked . Chauncey looked politely surprised . He said , smiling his charming and seductive smile , " Everything . Finance . Managing the investments of others . Investing in property for myself and others . Politics . Development of land . " He waved an eleganthand . " Everything . " " In Belleville ? " Jason 's smile was dour . " Not quite , though there are possibilities here . I was a guest a short time ago at Ipswich House . I was much impressed . Wonderful . An innovation . I hear you arranged it all . . . Jason . " Jason said nothing to that , and his stare became more piercing . " What possibilities ? " he asked . Chauncey looked down the table . " Well , I must confess something . I stopped at Ipswich House three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I brought Anita here for another few days . We did n't see you then . . . Jason . She was so delighted , she fell in love with Belleville . Rural , in a way , and she was brought up on a large farm near Boston . Quaint , she said , and wanted to live here , away from the noise and bustle of the city . A sort of refuge for her and Elizabeth . Once we moved , I began to think Belleville did have possibilities . "  | " Such as what ? " Chauncey involuntarily glanced again at Lionel , who kept his face without expression . Then he shrugged . " I get feelings . ' Sometimesthey 're right , sometimes they are wrong . We 'll see . In the meantime , we are enjoying living here . At least Anita and Elizabethenjoy it ; I do , too , on visits . I have my main offices in New York and Philadelphia and just . . . dabble here , for my own amusement . " Jason took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became aware that everyone was watching him now and not speaking . " Dabble . . . in what ? " said Jason . " Nature . " Chauncey laughed . " I like to hunt and fish and boat on the river and watch the people . So simple , so without complications . So . . . sincere . " " What makes you think they are ? " " Jason , " said Patricia in a quelling tone ; her eyes were glazed the way they often were , lately , especially after her luncheons . " I 'm a city boy , " said Chauncey . " Perhaps I 'm imagining simplicity and honesty here . " " You are , " said Jason . His tone was heavy . " Small towns are quite as vicious as the cities . " " How do you know that ? " cried Patricia , and her intoxication made her voice too loud , almost fierce . " You almost never go to Philadelphia or New York ! You imprison me here in this awful town , with nothing worthwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She glowered at him . " No opera here , no concerts , no symphonies ! Nothing . Only dull , stupid people . No class , no style , no fashion . Dull , dull , dull ! " She hit the table with a clenched fist . " I hate it . " " Patricia , " he said again , and this time  --  and for the first time ever with Patricia  --  his tone was formidable . She looked at him in half-drunken stupefaction , then turned to Lionel as if for protection . But he kept his face averted , thoughtful . Joan was watching ; a Mona Lisa smile curled her mouth , and it was cruel . Lionel thought it time to direct the conversation . " Among other things , Jase , Chauncey is becoming interested in the hotel business . After seeing Ipswich House . " Chauncey looked eager and boyish . " Yes ! Since seeing yourp282hotel , Jason , I 've bought over one thousand acres in the Poconos , nearer to New York by eighteen miles or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thousand acres ! " I 've thought of it . A different kind of hotel . I can get the financing from New York . A grand hotel , such as they have in Europe . If it works out , I am going to call it Honeymoon Haven . " " Marvelous ! " exclaimed Mrs. Schofield , and clapped her hands . " Chauncey , dearest , you never told me about that ! " " Honeymoon Haven ? " asked Jason , making a mouth . " What does that mean ? " " Well , sir , something different . There are family hotels in Pennsylvania . And Ipswich House , which is unique . " Chauncey looked very disarming and earnest . " A refuge for tired businessmen . And their . . . wives . To renew their first . . . love . " " Ipswich House is n't a family hotel , Mr. Schofield . " " I know that ! That 's what interests me , that 's what inspired my idea ! A grand hotel , very large , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to reach . Ipswich House inspired me . But I thought on a far bigger scale . The railroad is already near my land . I intend a real palace ! " He looked down for a moment . " I hope it does n't seriously interfere with Ipswich House , which , of course , is considerably farther from New York and more inconvenientto reach . " Ah , thought Jason . He said , " Do you know how much your hotel will cost ? " Chauncey looked rueful . " I know , I know . It 'll be millions , at least twenty . I 've raised eight . " " You do n't use your own money ? " Chauncey laughed . " There are three classes of entrepreneurs who never use their own money  --  thieves , bankers , and private investors ! " Jason wanted to ask him in which category he placed himself , but decided that was too rude . He returned to the subject of the new hotel . " Honeymoon Haven . Sounds like a cathouse to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylish cathouse . " " Jase , " said Lionel . " Ladies present . " " Never mind , Lionel , " Chauncey said with humor . " We know what we are talking about , even if the ladies do n't . Jason , I hear Ipswich House is n't entirely pure . I have friends who come here  --  with ladies of the moment . Very discreet . "  | " But you do n't intend to be discreet . " " Jason , this is a new era . We 'll advertise carefully . Come on . Men are men . You should know that . But there 'll be nothing vulgarabout my hotel . Everything very elegant and very costly . Tired businessmen deserve that . It 'll be very expensive , very , to keep the lugs out . " " Men like Diamond Jim Brady , of course . " Chauncey showed all his white teeth . " If they can pay , who cares ? " " Do you intend to recruit . . . the ladies too ? " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Chauncey said , " Hardly . I do n't know what you 're thinking , Jason . " " Yes , you do . I think it 's disgusting . " He added , " You 'll never be able to do that in Pennsylvania . We 're very moral here . " Chauncey gave his charming smile and rubbed his fingers together . " I have friends among the state senators who are all for progress . " " Progress to what ? " " To admitting human nature . " " And confessing we are not above the beasts of the field ? " " Well , are we ? " Chauncey winked , and Jason wanted to hit him . He said , " I 've heard about some of the big cities . The gentlemensee their wives safely to bed , and then they go out . To places where they have young girls , eight and ten years old , who are chloroformed so their screams of agony ca n't be heard outside the bedrooms . Sold , like cattle , for money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Often they die of their injuries . . . . " " Do you really have to talk like that ? " shouted Patricia , shuddering . " I do n't believe a word of it ! " " Life is hard , Patricia , " said Jason . " My grandfather , may he rest in peace , told me much of this world , and the men in it . I thought , sometimes , that he was exaggerating . I do n't now . Not since tonight . " " So unchristian ! " wailed Patricia . " It always was , Patricia . Someone once said , ' There was only one Christian , and he was crucified . ' Patricia , you do n't look well . Shall we excuse ourselves and go ? "  | " I meant you were unchristian , Jason ! So uncharitable . Misinterpretingwhat was said here . " " Shall we go ? " " No , " she whimpered . " Let 's talk of something pleasant . " Joan exchanged a look with Lionel . Chauncey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . " Lionel said , his yellow eyes intent , " Jason , I 've invested twenty thousand dollars in Chauncey 's new venture . He 's talked to the bankers here . They are willing to lend him two million . And the banks in Philadelphia and New York are negotiating . They think it is a very profitable idea . " " They would , " said Jason , and pushed back his chair . " Bankers are in business to make money . They 're not here to watch public morality . " " I know . Patricia ? " But Lionel said , " We thought you might like to invest too , Jason . " Jason was incredulous . He stared at his brother-in-law . " I ? Are you insane ? " Chauncey lifted his hand placatingly . " All right . Jason does n't want to invest . He does n't want to be rich . He 's a simple man ; no greed for money . Let it go at that . " There 's something else , thought Jason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Chauncey , " perhaps you do n't need to worry , Jason , and have your morality offended . But there is that one thousand acres we own . Next to it is another thousand , even more desirable . We need them . " Ah , thought Jason . " But we do n't know who owns them . We 've tried to find out . They 're registered under the name of the Brothers Company . We ca n't find out who the Brothers are . We thought perhaps that you might know . " Jason kept his face expressionless . He thought of what Patrick had bought . No one was to know . Of course , there was a large mortgage on it , but the lenders agreed to secrecy . Why Patrick had insisted on this , Jason had never learned . Had he known about Chauncey Schofield ? Patrick had said , " You 've a fine mind , Jason . I 've left it all to you . Yes , it 's a risk , with all we owe in Belleville.  |p285Ke|pt  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 'll be yours , Jason , all of it , when I 'm dead . " Jason said , " I do n't know who owns that property and I do n't care . And I could n't invest in your hotel , Mr. Schofield . I doubt I could raise a hundred thousand dollars . We owe everything and everybody . " " But you 're building a new hotel forty miles from here . " " Already heavily mortgaged . " " You 've a reputation for hotel business , Jason . I 've heard that all over . " So , they want me , too , for their rich whorehouse . Jason smiled , and it was a forbidding smile . " I 'm glad to hear I have a good reputation . It is worth something in the banks  --  who own us at present . But not for long . Patricia ? " " But there is dessert , " said Joan , speaking for the first time . " A special dessert . Patricia 's favorite . " " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English trifle . " Patricia threw up her hands . " Oh , good , good ! " " Patricia ? " said Jason , and his face was set . Mrs. Schofield leaned toward him . " Jason , dear , do n't deprive the dear girl of a treat . You businessmen are always in such a hurry . And I love trifle too . " Jason looked at the two men present . " I do n't , " he said , and stood up . " Patricia . We are leaving now . " He was dismayed . Did they suspect who owned those other thousand acres ? If so , how had the information leaked ? He must talk to Patrick immediately.  | " I told you he was a man of principle and narrow prejudices , " said Lionel when he and Chauncey sat alone in the library . " I also told you he is exactly what we need . A man of principle . Who 'd suspect anything then ? " " Well , you are n't going to get him , Chauncey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . pressures . No one can resist the pressures . It 'll take some time . Perhaps years . But we 're young . " He lit a cigar . " And we 'll get that acreage , too . " " Are you sure about that land ? " Chauncey reflected . " Pretty sure . My information was guaranteedauthentic . " " He usually tells me everything , " said Lionel , hurt . Chauncey roared in laughter . " This time he did n't ! " He added , " Of course , I could be mistaken . It 'll take some time to investigate more thoroughly . " Later that night , in bed , after a rapturous half-hour , Joan said to Lionel , " We all know my brother . He should have been the priest , not Jack . What a fool Jason is ! He sounded like a Christian Brother , and he does n't go to Mass . " " Well , Joan my love , an Irishman can take himself out of the Church , but you ca n't take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my darling . " " But I 'm different . " He ran his hands passionately over her small body , and she clung to him . " Thank something-or-other for that , " she said , and began to gasp . She had a breast like a white dove . Lionel nestled against it ,  |p288moaning  . Joan , Joan , he thought . For a while he forgot everything but his wife . " I have never seen or heard anything so rude in all my life , " Patricia sobbed on the way home . " You 're still young , old girl , " said Jason . " You 'll learn some-day . " " There 's nothing I want to learn from you ! Such a display of ill-breeding and crudeness , to say the least ! And to important , superiorpeople like the Schofields , who know everyone ! " Her sobs grew louder and tears poured down her cheeks . Usually her reproaches would make Jason immediately contrite and he would exhaust himself begging her pardon over and over and calling himself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regret or concern over offending her . He was startled at this , and hardly heard her continuing diatribes of shame , anger , and contempt . Something had caught his ear in her voice , and he wondered about it . He had heard this slurring before when they had gone out or after she had visited her friends for lunch , and he had thought it " mere nerves . " But  --  and it came to him like a cold shock  --  he had heard that blurring of words in taverns and in Mrs. Lindon 's house . It was the voice of drunkenness , stumbling over multisyllabic words . He also recalled , again with shock , that Patricia 's face , after going out , would look quite bloated , her eyes glazed , her lips wet , and that her irritability , always so close to the surface at the best of times , would become more shrill , more emphatic . She would scream like a Fury then , insulting beyond reason , and her laughter , not merry , would be as ear-shattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What had she had ? Only two little glasses of sherry and two glasses of wine at dinner . Not enough to make even a teetotaler tipsy . How often , he thought with a new coldness , had she been . . . like that ? Too many times , and it had been getting worse lately . Surely not . Was n't she always making disdainful remarks about her father 's drinking ? Did n't she call " strong spirits " the drink of the unlettered and generally worthless ? As for a woman who drank , such a person was not to be mentioned by ladies , since drink was probably the least of her sins . No lady " drank , " except for a small glass of sherry beforep289dinner or a little wine with the dinner itself . Though gentlemen drank strong spirits . . . well , gentlemen were gentlemen  --  if they kept it all within bounds and did not became coarse in the presence of ladies . Even then , it was hardly admirable . Jason had never been particularly tactful ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , " Patricia , have you . . . have you . . . been drinking whiskey ? " " What ? " she said , wiping her dripping eyes . " What did you say , interrupting me ? " " Whiskey , Patricia . Did you have any whiskey tonight ? " He was horrified at his very words . There was a sharp silence . Patricia 's wet eyes blinked . Of course she had not had any whiskey , for God 's sake ! Two little sherries , one or two glasses of wine . Her affront made her speechless . Then , in more of a rage than she had ever felt , she clenched her thin hand into a fist and struck Jason on the arm , crying out in horror and insult , " How dare you , how dare you , you beast ! Wait until I tell Dada ! " She had turned to him on the seat of the car , and a wind whipped her breath to him . The unmistakable sour odor of whiskey . " Patricia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She raised her hand to strike him again , and her white face was fiendish in the passing lamplight . " Oh , you monster ! " she cried . He caught the hand flailing at his face and almost crushed it in his grip , for he was both enraged and terribly afraid . A drunken man was to be held in contempt . A drunken woman was to be both pitiedand despised . Patricia 's screaming voice flew along the street in rattling echoes . " I never even tasted whiskey in all my life , except once when I was eight years old and had a toothache and Dada poured a spoonful of it on the tooth ! Never before , never since ! You .. . you . . . " Her breath struck him again , the sour effluvia assailed him , stronger than ever . Yet , there was verity in her voice . Patricia was a very poor liar ; she lacked the imagination . Again Jason was jolted . But he could not understand . There was only one solution ; someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why ? This time the shock was physically as well as mentally painful . He was hurt enough at Lionel 's implied interest in the " richp290whorehouse . " He had not once come to Jason 's aid , nor had he agreed with him tonight . He had only watched and listened , his yellow eyes jumping with secret hilarity . Jason had thought the hilaritywas directed at Chauncey . No , he told himself now with increasingpain and a sense of awful bereavement . It was at me . My friend . He was making fun of me , in his mind . Jason 's grief was nearly as overwhelming as at Bernard 's death . He almost collided with a tree , and Patricia screamed , " It 's you who 's drunk , or mad ! You just about killed us then ! You 're in-sane . " Where else , going back now years , had she had whiskey ? Who had slyly given it to her ? What had anyone to gain by this ? Patriciahad no secrets ; she knew nothing much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be induced to babble them . She was a gossip , but all women were gossips , and she was too ignorant of the world to absorb the low degradations to which so many could descend . But some people had been cruel enough to do this to her . Evil was not always directed at importance . It was banal , small , too . She had been given whiskey frequently , at least twice a week lately . But why , in the name of Christ , why ? " I hate you , I hate you ! " she was sobbing . " I 'll never forgive you ! " Poor girl , he thought with pity , but without his usual urge to appease her . I 'll get to the bottom of this ! She fought him as he carried her upstairs to her bedroom . She tried to get off the bed on which he had gently laid her , then suddenlycollapsed , bubbles gathering at the corners of her mouth . But a moment later she was heaving and he ran to the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was leaning over the edge of the bed and retching . Chewed food and wine poured out of her , and now the stink of whiskey was stronger . There had been more than sherry in those glasses . Two ? Perhaps she had had more . When he was talking to Chauncey , Lionel had been busy refilling glasses , and Jason had not even noticed when his own was refilled . Lionel was deft . Lionel . Jason held his wife 's struggling head ; her hair was damp , and so was her forehead . Her slight body was convulsed . Jason wanted to kill whomever was responsible . " There , there , dear , " he said . " I 'll get a wet cloth . " She had fallen back on her pillows , panting , her eyes bloodshot and suffused.  |p291He  wiped her mouth . " Oh , God , " she groaned . " It was that . . . awful corned beef ; it always makes me sick . Joan knows I hate it . She should have had something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching her . His grief and fear sickened him . Somebody would pay for all this . He recalled being awakenedat night in his own room next door , hearing something like moans from Patricia 's , and then the running of water . This was not new . Patricia abruptly fell asleep , her mouth sagging open . Jason removedher dress and her slippers . How thin her body was , even more so than after the twins had been born . Jason felt rage and terror , but no longer tenderness . He was never to feel tender toward Patricia again , only pity and the solicitudeof a friend who no longer loves but because of past affection offers compassion in sorrow and loss . As Chauncey and his wife , Anita , drove home from Lionel 's house , Anita said , " Well , dearie , your charm did n't accomplish anything tonight , did it ? " " Not directly , pet , not directly . But I learned something . I learned that Garrity ca n't be made to do anything just for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will have to use other means , more strenuous ones , ones he 'll never know about until it 's too late . " Chauncey laughed . " And then he 'll wonder what has hit him . " " You really are a very naughty boy , sweetheart , " said Anita , and laughed fondly . He patted her hand , and she moved against him and put her head on his shoulder . " And you 're a naughty girl , and a very lovely one , and I love you , love you , " he murmured , and made his voice low and husky , and Anita shivered and snuggled closer to him . How she loved him , the dear pet , so handsome , so engaging , so full of charm . She held his hand tightly before releasing it and after kissing him strongly on the mouth . He smiled to himself . He had outmaneuvered men like Garrity before , and had reduced them to bewildered bankruptcy . It had been all their fault , not his , the idiots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs , if they were willing . Their rejection was their own doing . Life had no place in it for men of principle and conscience . He had no resentment toward Jason , no animosity . Jason hadp292had his chance and had refused it , unlike Chauncey 's friends in New York and Boston who were as wily and conscienceless as he , Chauncey , and knew good chances when they saw them and expressedtheir gratitude by putting more opportunities in his hands . " You never did tell me how you found out about who owned that property you want , " Anita said . " Well , I 'm not sure , myself . But I 'll find out pretty soon . It 's probably Garrity and Mulligan . In fact , it 's almost certain . I watched Garrity when I mentioned the land . He 's easy to read ; his face changed in a way I 'm familiar with . Do n't worry , sweet-heart . " " The only thing I worry about , dearest , is that perhaps you might stop loving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stop loving you , Anita ? Why , dammit , you 're my whole life ! If there was a God , I 'd thank him for letting me find you , you silly little girl . You 've made my whole existence , " and his voice broke most sincerely . They reached their house , which was partway up one of the mountains , a new house and a splendid one , that Anita had furnished with the help of an interior decorator from Philadelphia . People now called it " a showcase . " Chauncey looked up at IpswichHouse . It was late , but almost all the windows shone with light . A splendid place . A model for other hotels . Chauncey 's handsome mouth literally watered for it , and he nodded and smiled to himself . When he and Anita were up in their lavish gold-colored bedroom , he said , " I 'll give you your nightcap , sweetheart . You look a little tired . " She was disappointed , but she knew that disappointment made her look older and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm tired myself . " He went into the bathroom , opened the cabinet , and took out a packet of sleeping powders . Anita often had headaches , but she would not wear her glasses when with other people , nor would she wear them regularly in front of him . He poured one of the powders carefully into a glass , opened another powder and put it into the glass , too . He watched it fizz , then carried it into the bedroom . Anita was already in her most seductive nightgown , and he said admiringly , " That 's lovely , beautiful ! Is it new ? " Her flesh bulged against the silk and lace and ribbons.  | " Yes . I 'm glad you like it , dearest . " He bent and kissed her fully on the mouth , and she put up her arms and clung to him . Her perfume was stale . She had removed her cosmetics , and the web of little lines on her babyish face was very visible . Chauncey kissed her again , even more soundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet dreams ! " Her infatuated and enchanted eyes stared at him , and her heart filled with love and gratitude that he was hers and that he loved her . Still looking at him , she obediently drank the draft to its dregs . She made a coy face and said , " What a terrible taste . But it does help me sleep . " Chauncey stood near her , smiling . He had removed his clothes and had put on a silk nightshirt and a crimson satin robe . He glanced at himself in the mirror , winked at his image , and ran his hand over his abundant crisp brown hair . His heart began to beat with a familiar excitement . He lay down beside his wife . He put his arm under her and drew her head to his shoulder . He yawned very widely and rubbed his eyes . Then he turned his head and kissed Anita deeply . She was already half-asleep . He stroked her hair and cheek , and she sighed happily and held his hand . He waited half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell asleep . Her mouth opened ; she began a soft snoring . Carefully , inch by inch , he withdrew his arm , lifted her head from his shoulder , and slowly laid it on her pillow . He turned off the bedside lamp . He slipped even more carefully from the bed . He stood up . At the door he paused to listen . The snoring was louder . He opened the door and crept out , closing it after him . Again he waited for a murmur or movement . It did not come . He walked lightly down the long hall , and his excitement grew , but he did not hurry . He tapped on a closed door . It opened . Elizabeth , with her pretty face and long fair hair , stood before him , clad in a nightgown the color of diaphanous moonlight and a robe of light silk embroidered in silver . She smiled radiantly at him , and without a word he entered her room . She closed the door . She put her arms about his neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbed his body against hers . Her flesh was warm and sweet . She held up her face to him , and they kissedp294long and with rising passion . " Oh , my God , " Elizabeth whispered against his mouth , and kissed him again . She smelled of violets . He carried her to her bed and lay down with her . He turned off the lamp and took her in his arms . Jason could not sleep . He finally got up and moved silently into Patricia 's room . She was as he had left her , in a drunken stupor , snoring , and motionless . She had a night light on , for since childhoodshe had been afraid of the dark ; it was a feeble yellowish light , but adequate for what he felt he must do . Hardly making the whisper of a sound , and always listening for a break in the heavy snoring , he opened drawer after drawer in her dresser and dressing table . The old furniture did not creak ; the drawers moved as if on water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin or light creamy wool , her nightgowns in silken envelopes , her corsets stiff with bone and dripping with cords , her camisoles with all their ribbons . To Jason , they had a sort of innocence , a naivete , and for a few minutes he felt he was violating something childlike and undefended . But he went on , grimly searching . He opened closet doors to peignoirs , to flannel gowns , to rows of slippers and hats . The dressing table was full of her scents and powders , and , hidden in one drawer , some tiny pots of paste rouge . For some reason this seemed to him the saddest of all . He did not find what he was looking for , though he searched under the cushions of chairs , on the backs of shelves , under the bed . He opened empty traveling cases , found a huge unlocked wardrobe trunk and looked in every crevice and in all the drawers . Nothing . He felt behind draperies and over valences . Nothing but dust . He saw his ghostly face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious eyes , and the hard set of his mouth . He went back to the bed and stood looking down at Patricia . " What is it , dear ? " he asked her in his mind . " Who 's done this to you , and why ? " Her eyelashes flickered as if she had heard him . Then she moaned and said faintly , " My darling , my darling . " There was agony in her muttering voice . She moved restlessly , and moaned again . Jason frowned . Not for an instant did he think she was addressinga man . Nor , he thought , was she speaking to him . One of the children ? Yes , little Nick , her favorite . Jason wanted to kiss her cheek , touch her hand . His deep and incredible love for her hadp295gone forever , and he knew it . It was replaced now with a protectiveaffection , the love of a brother involved with her well-being but not with her emotions . There was an emptiness , yes , but not a desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very alone . He went downstairs into the dining room and to the liquor cabinet . There were wines there , Patrick 's , but the compartment that held whiskey was surely locked , padlocked , in fact , for , as Patrick had often said , " Servants go for the hard stuff , not the tasty ones . " Jason knew that only he and Patrick had the keys to the musty cellar , where extra supplies of liquors were kept . Patricia had never gone down there in her life , for she was terrified of spiders and mice and webs and dead flies . Jason , dusty and exhausted , went back upstairs . So Patricia was not getting any whiskey in this house . Where was she getting it , then ? At the homes of friends . Jason cursed under his breath . Why ? But he knew why  --  the pointless but boundless malevolence of humanity , the mindless malice which sought only to hurt , to mock , to ridicule . Da had been quite right : man was not worthy to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first as a joke , perhaps , to have revenge on her prissiness or to punish her for her arrogance , or perhaps even in envy . Her susceptibilityhad then been discovered , and her trustingness , and so the giggling and delighted whisper had spread . Patricia , under the influence , would reveal titillating tidbits of her personal life and the life of her family . Jason felt his face burn with wrath , and he clenched his hands and his breath came fast . Lionel had heard of Patricia 's misfortune . He would not think it a misfortune  --  he would think it amusing . He had never liked Patricia , and had always , until Jason had married her , ridiculed her lightly even to him . He had actually turned white when Jason told him of the marriage . He had stared at Jason strangely . Then he had said , " No , no , " in an odd voice . But he had made himself smile , and shaken hands with Jason , and had congratulated him . However , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often found Lionel looking at him with an expression of mingled affection and dismay . Lionel had attended the reception after the church wedding , and Jason had caught him staring at him from a distance , as at a beloved brother who has been betrayed or injured . As Jason finally undressed , very slowly and wearily , he remem/bered these things . Lionel knew of Jason 's love for Patricia ; he would not willingly hurt Patricia , for that would hurt his friend . Lionel was naturally malicious , but it was a light and jesting malice . He was not one to play practical jokes just for his own amusement . That he was capable of malignancy , Jason had long suspected , but he had not as yet shown it . Lionel certainly had no reason to hate Patricia ; even if he had , he would not attack his best friend through her . Besides his friendship for Jason , Lionel would also remember that Patricia was his employer 's daughter . Yet , he had given her whiskey tonight . And he had brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , Jason , would find out , and his thoughts about Lionel were for the first time both anguished and vengeful . He lay awake until it was time to get up . He listened at Patricia 's door . There was no sound but that of snoring . Patrick had left for his office at the Inn-Tavern . Jason went into the hall telephone closet , carefully shut the door , and called his father-in-law . He said , " Mr. Mulligan . I 've got to see you and Daniel in your office the very first thing this morning . In an hour . Would you call him for me , please ? It 's a matter of extreme im-portance. "  | " It 's a grand girl , our Molly , " said Patrick Mulligan to his nephew Daniel . His voice was fond . " Severe , and sharp-tongued , and nononsense . It 's happy I am that she comes here every week to look over the work and see the girls are not lying down on the job and that every file is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly , " said her husband , also fondly . " And a big conscience . She feels that if she is n't supervisingyour office , and you , too , Uncle Pat , everything will collapseand you 'll be robbed of your last dollar . She has n't much faith in men 's intelligence , thinks we 're lackadaisical . " Patrick sighed . " Ah , if you had a son ! A fine broth of a boy he 'd be with Molly as his mum and you as his dada . Well , then . With all the debt we 're in , Molly has the right to be worried about us . " Daniel laughed . " Molly would rather starve than go into debt . I constantly tell her money does n't grow by hiding it in a mattress  --  or in a bank , for that matter . I wanted her to go to New York last week for some new clothes ; she has n't bought even a pair of shoes since we ran into debt and into the hands of the money lenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that we are doing splendidly , paying off the mortgages , and that , in fact , the Inn-Tavern is mortgage-free . That does n't satisfy her enough . There 's Ipswich House , still , and the new hotel we have under way . Anyway , she refused to buy clothes she badly needs . She mends her stockings , too , and her drawers , and I found her patching the elbows of an old coat . Do n't laugh , Uncle Pat . I 'm serious , even if I 'm laughing myself . Dear Molly . "  | " Dear Molly , " echoed Patrick . " But she is right . We 're still heavily in debt , even if struggling well with it . " " Well , Molly 's no advertisement of our solvency and success , " said Daniel . " I tell her to keep out of sight of our bankers , or they might call in their notes . When she went to Sunderland 's first grandchild 's baptism party last week , she wore a dress five years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed , but that is all you could say about it . I was embarrassed . " " Still , " said Patrick cheerily , " that will show the bankers that we 're not profligate with their damned money . " " Then , " said Daniel , laughing again , " I undermined their confidence . I myself was dressed even more splendidly than Lionel Nolan , that rascal . And Joan looked impossibly exquisite , as usual , and as transcendent as a saint in stained glass . And Patty , as usual , was . . . stylish . Why were n't you and Jason there , too ? " " We had work to do . An emergency , " said Patrick with virtue . " What emergency ? " Patrick scratched a pink ear . " I do n't remember me , just now . But , sure and it was an emergency . What else ? " Daniel leaned back in his chair and carefully lit one of his expensivecigars after giving one to his uncle . His eyes , looking even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , musinglyfixed themselves on Patrick . He was still solidly handsome , if losing some of his hair , and he gave the impression of alert strength and agility . He said , " I wonder why Jason is in such a sweat , wanting to see us this morning . " " Now , then , I do n't know . It is n't like Jason to get his bowels all stirred up like a silly woman . I 've tried to think what it is . " Patrick spread out his hands . " If it was something about Patricia , he would n't ask that you be here too , Danny . So it 's nothing per-sonal . " Daniel thoughtfully watched a coil of blue smoke rise toward the ceiling ; it coiled sluggishly , for the day was quite hot and the little office was steamy with heat and smelled even more strongly of dust than usual , and was far more untidy than when Molly was the " typewriter . " Only one change had been made : the files , growing all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the two stenographers of whom Molly did not entirely approve . " I did all the work myself , " she often told them , her honeycoloredeyes cold and rebuking , " and now there are two of you ,  |p299and  you are always complaining there is too much work . The trouble is that you work only nine hours a day and a half a day Saturday , while I worked ten hours and all day Saturday for half of what you each get now . " " Times have changed , " one girl remarked pertly . " So they have , Miss Gradz , and for the worse . No one wants to work anymore , or earn an honest dollar . " Her stare at the younger girls was daunting . They hated and resented her , but they gave her grudging respect . Daniel said , " You 've never told Jason that you put him on the deed to that thousand acres , have you , Uncle Pat ? " " No . That was the agreement between you and me , Danny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my will . " " And I told you that was redundant . He 's on the deed , and that 's more than enough . Right of survivor , of course . Well , that 's a safeguard for you , I must admit , if the unforeseen should happenand he predeceases you , which is n't likely . I explained to you at the time you put him on the deed that you could n't sell , later , without his signature and agreement . It does put you in an awkwardposition , though , it you wanted to sell and he balked . " " Why should he , in the name of the saints ? He 's married to my daughter ; he 's like a son to me . Jase would never oppose me in a simple sale , if we decided not to build on it ourselves . I did buy it for speculation , though . " " I heard a rumor that Schofield bought the adjoining thousand acres . " " No ! Did he , then ? " Patrick sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a scoundrel if there ever was one ! " " It 's just a rumor . Schultz told me last week . And Schultz also told me that Schofield 's sniffing around to find out who owns the other thousand acres  --  which we own , or rather , you and Jason own . " Patrick smiled widely and rubbed his thumb against his index finger . " But we made sure the owner 's name would n't get out , did n't we ? No use letting the banks in this town get a whiff of that news ; they 'd be crying over our notes they hold . Calling me reckless , and such , taking on another big mortgage . Well , my da alwayssaid land is the only security . " " Even with mortgages up to your . . . crotch , Uncle Pat . " " Ha , " said Patrick , " higher than that , bucko , higher than that.  |p300And  once I was so damned careful and never owed a penny . Land fever . " He considered . " Wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they tell me . I 've tried to get some idea about him from Sunderland and the other banks , but they said they did n't know what he does , and it was none of their business . " " Which means it is , " said Daniel , and frowned at his cigar . " When a banker pretends indifference , you can be sure he 's got his finger in the pie , too . But what pie ? Nothing in Belleville , I 've heard , or not as yet . An interesting situation . . . . Where 's Jason , by the way ? He 's fifteen minutes late . " Daniel paused . " We do n't even know if Schofield really owns those other acres . " Jason was entering the outer office , where Molly was still sternly examining what had been done the past week in the files . He burst into the room , and Molly looked up , startled at the crash , and then her fine skin flushed . Her eyes opened wide , her hands trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tremulous . " Hello , Jason , " she said . " Hello , " he said shortly . He often encountered Molly here , and considered her a " busybody . " " Daniel and Mr. Mulligan here ? " Molly nodded . Jason was about to pass her abruptly , and then , for some mysterious reason , he halted and turned to her again . They looked at each other in a sharp silence broken only by the fast rattle of the two typewriters . Molly certainly was n't stylish . Her shapeless brown suit was obviouslyout-of-date ; the skit c was wide and unfashionably low , and her blouse with its plain white jabot looked wilted and tired . Her hair was not arranged in the present Irene Castle fashion , which simulated , without cutting , the dancer 's " bob . " Patricia wore it that way . Molly 's brilliantly red hair , shining and fiery in the sunlight , was severely braided , then wound on top of her small head like a coronet . But her eyes , Jason noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last night returned to Jason . " She 's in love with you and always was ! " It was as if the words were freshly spoken , and Jason 's first reaction was amusement . Molly Nolan , now Mrs. Dugan . Molly . And then : Molly !  --  incredulously . He could only stare , as if seeing her for the first time . She did not move , yet her eyes appeared to come closer , flashing like sunlit gold . It 's ridiculous , thought Jason , feeling suddenly confused . Mollyp301Nolan , pigtailed Molly Nolan with the sharp tongue  --  the same littlegirl I knew and disliked all my life . Never a sweet word or a sweet smile . Just . . . Molly , who disliked me as much as I dislikedher and was always underfoot , visiting Joan , helping Joan with her lessons . Why ? Jason saw something now that he had never seen before  --  that Molly was beautiful , that she had a " good " face without guile or trivial meanness , that her figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lissome lines , and that her hands , wearing only a plain wedding ring , were soft and white , yet eminently capable . They were useful hands , deft and quick . The clattering typewriters invaded Jason 's ears almost painfully . He came to himself and felt a line of dampness over his long Irish lip . He said , " They 're here ? " Molly nodded again . Now she was smiling , and her steady lips were shaking a little . It was a smile Jason had never seen before , full of womanly emotion and sweetness . He turned quickly and went to the other office 's door , opened it , then shut it behind him . Molly leaned weakly against the files , and her heart was jumping . Something like ecstasy flowed over her . She felt drunk and did not know why . She only knew that something had passed between her and Jason , with soaring sparks . Patrick and Daniel looked up when Jason exploded into the office , a most unusual entrance for the , . customarily quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore his mourning uniform of thick black wool , and he looked rumpled and ominous . Patrick was in shirtsleeves , Daniel cool and well-tailored in a light tan Palm Beach suit with a brown-and-white-striped shirt fresh from the iron . Every brown hair was in place , and his florid face was calm . Both men smiled at Jason , though somewhat warily . Jason , Daniel now often said , " could be difficult at times , " and unbending when a matter of principle was involved . " Well , " said Patrick , " and a good morning to you , bucko , and here we are , as you asked , and waiting . " Daniel nodded pleasantly , and relit his cigar and leaned back in his chair . Jason flung himself down in another chair , glaring . " It 's a long story , " he said with abruptness , and plunged into it . The two other men listened in attentive silence . He was not one to gesture , but now he gesturedvehemently , and his fists were clenched . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath.  |p302Patrick  and Daniel regarded each other significantly . Patrick 's full cheeks had turned crimson ; Daniel 's eyes were full of meaning . " Well , well , " said Patrick in a genial tone , " so now we have a little idea of what Schofield does , then . A gambler . A chancetaker . Something like you , Jase . " Jason was aghast and freshly enraged . " Me ? " he shouted . " Me ? " Patrick nodded happily . " Yes , like you , bucko . Look what you did with Ipswich House and the other hotel we are building . Chances , and me crying in my breakfast porridge over it all . But you were right , even if we are up to . . . well , our necks in debt . " " You 're putting me in the same class with that thief ? " " Now , " said Daniel , " who says he is a thief ? Where 's your proof , Jason ? " Jason turned to him suddenly , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about him , dammit ! I have an instinct about such men . But that 's not the only thing . It 's the sort of hotel he wants to build , with investors ' money . A big , luxurious whore-house . " Daniel said softly , " Oh , my God . " Patrick was undisturbed , but now his bright blue eyes sharpened . He said , " Jason , my boyo , when did God set you up as a censor on the morals of other people ? Wait a minute , please . What has it to do with you ? Sure and it has , you 've as much as said . Because of the land I 've left you in my will , next to his land ? " Jason turned red with frustration . " You do n't understand , Mr. Mulligan . I  --  we  --  intend , I hope , to build still another hotel on that land . Think what having such an unsavory place next door will do to the value of our land . " Patrick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plump pink hand . " Listen to me , Jase . Sin does n't only pay , but it pays handsomely . Never let the priests tell you different . Crime flourishes because it pays high interest and is solvent . I could tell you many tales of the rascals in New York , in politics and such , who have fine mansions on Fifth Avenue with fleets of servants and yachts and gold and jewelry and wives above reproach . They are respected by senators and presidents and honoredeverywhere , with eulogies in their churches when they die . How did they make their money ? By honest dealing , then ? Byp303going to Mass on Sunday and supporting orphans and widows and feeding the poor , and such ? Is that why they are honored ? No , boyo , no . And many they are who own expensive brothels into the bargain , and they are the protectors of chorus girls and beautiful whores . Many of those fine gentlemen , Jase , made their money by cheating the people out of public funds , selling rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone despise them , then ? Look at Tammany Hall , for instance . . . " He paused , shook his head admonishingly . " Jason , how old are you ? A grown man , and you know no more of the world than a baby in his nappies . " Jason 's rage only increased . He tried to keep from shouting as he said , " Your property , Mr. Mulligan ! It wo n't be worth a damn with Schofield 's hotel next to it . " " I disagree , " said Daniel . " As Uncle Pat has tried to tell you , it will increase the value . But land value is n't exactly what you have in mind , is it ? " Jason knew he was being made to look like a fool , and this infuriatedhim even more . " No , " he said . " But Schofield  --  he makes me sick , sick to death . He . . . he tried to buy me ; his offer of an investment was just an excuse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good man when he sees him , and you ought to be flattered , Jase . Now , now . Calm down a minute . " Jason almost yelled , " He wants me as a front for his disgusting proposition ! That 's all ! I did n't think that before , but now I see it . The hell with him . I ca n't understand your position , Mr. Mulligan , I ca n't . " Patrick leaned toward him , and his face was one Jason had never seen before ; it was tight and knowing and not too kind . " Laddie , you know that not all of our guests are nice virtuous married folk . You 've known that for years . " " But we do n't blatantly advertise that illicit couples are particularlyinvited ! We do n't imply we 're running a brothel ! If we have to shut our eyes to some . . . things , well , as you once said , Mr. Mulligan , that 's business . " Jason 's voice had become bitter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a seminarian , Mr. Mulligan . I do know something of the world . I know we ca n't demand that every couple who comes to Ipswich House show us a marriage certificate , dammit ! But we do try to run a decent place , and that'sp304why we have a good guest list of respectable people , mainly . But literally to advertise  --  " " You mean implying , ' not advertising , ' Jason , " said Daniel . " Not even Schofield would be so blatant . " Jason gave him a scathing glance . " He is n't actually going to advertise what the place will be in the newspapers ! He 'll just spread the word ! I accused him , and he never denied it . Word of mouth is almost as good as advertising outright . " " Who knows ? " said Daniel , and shrugged and looked at his uncle . Patrick said , " You 're not as white as snow yourself , Jase . You visited Mrs. Lindon 's establishment before you married my daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , now . Let me finish . I know that Patricia 's delicate , always was . I know it would kill her to have more children . I do n't condemn you , laddie , not at all . Men are men , and women are women . But you 're not one to sit in judgment , either . " Jason had become very pale . " I 'd rather see you in some nice clean place like Mrs. Lindon 's than killing my daughter , making her have more children . I know you love my colleen , and you 're sparing her . It 's glad I am you are , Jason . You 're a considerate husband , not a bad one . And how many men do you think are like you ? If you blame anyone , I 'm thinking you should blame nature , who did it all . It 's not of our choosing . " Jason said , " And it 's nature that makes us shit , too , but we do it privately , not publicly with music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Patrick smiled . " It 's not the same kind of pleasure , Jase . " Jason 's fists clenched again ; he was still pale . " Have you given a thought , Mr. Mulligan , to the young girls who will be involved in all this ? " " Jase , " said Patrick , " no one forces any girl into what is called a life of sin . ' Never mind the tales of white slavers . That 's very rare . A girl chooses her life . I doubt that Schofield 's hotel will be filled with streetwalkers and sluts and cheap whores . Men who go there will be rich enough to afford the best . Naughty ladies , no doubt , but beautiful and stylish ones . Like many who come to the Inn-Tavern and Ipswich House . " His eyes narrowed on Jason ,  |p305and  they were not too friendly , and Jason felt something quite close to despair . " Ladies such as Uncle Pat mentions usually retire on rich estates , " said Daniel , smiling . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't break your heart over them , Jason . Many are well-paid actresses and chorus girls . The Florodorasextet did very richly for themselves . I 've seen many of them in splendid Cadillacs on Fifth Avenue . They also live in little mansions , with servants , and travel abroad , after their retirement . ' Some have famous shops , exclusive restaurants , or own jewelry stores . Some even married wealthy men . " " I see I 'm getting nowhere , " said Jason . " What I am interested in , " said Patrick , " is , has he any idea who owns my thousand acres ? " Jason felt very tired . After all , he had not slept all night . " I do n't think so , " he said in a dull voice . " But he 'll find out . And that 's why I wanted to see you , sir , to ask you not to sell to him if he offers . " " He wo n't find out , " said Patrick . He paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " Jason saw a deep look being exchanged between uncle and nephew and felt sicker than ever . " Think , " Patrick mused to Daniel . " A thousand dollars an acre . " He pulled a paper toward him , and a pencil . He figured . Then he whistled . " Damn , " he said . " We could ask more . He probably wants it badly enough , " said Daniel . " We could pay off the mortgage on Ipswich House and finish the new hotel ! And more ! " Jason said , " Have you thought what will happen if he wo n't buy , at your price , Mr. Mulligan ? We could n't build a respectable hotel next to his . " " He 'll buy , " said Daniel . " I say at least fifteen hundred dollars an acre . It 's choice property . I 'll look into it at once . " Jason stood up . His eyes were sore with sleeplessness . He turned slowly , defeated . He saw Molly near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there , unnoticed ? Her eyes encountered his , and her face was both compassionate and understanding . He wanted to go to her and hold her . The longing was like a terrible hunger in him ; it was a desire for a refuge in a strange and alien land , a desire for love and companionship and surcease.  |p306But  as he went toward the door , she moved aside , though she did not look away from him . He left the office . The two men and Molly watched him go . Then Daniel said coldly , " I knew it was wrong of you , Uncle Pat , to put him on the deed . He 'll never agree . " " There are ways , " said Patrick , and thought of his daughter , who loved money even more than she did her children . Patricia was a sensible girl . For a considerable time now , Patrick had been aware of Patricia 's shrewdness , a trait he had not known earlier in her life . He was quite pleased . Lionel whistled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peremptory note from Jason . " Come to my office immediately . " Well , well , thought Lionel . He never wrote to me like that before . Lionel 's keen mind became sharpened . So , old Jason was going to " take him down " because of Schofield last night . Lionel did not smile . Jason was not only manager of IpswichHouse but also son-in-law of the owner . For the first time Lionel lost his confidence in the profound friendship between himself and Jason . Still , he was married to Jason 's sister . Jason would not hurt his brother-in-law for fear of hurting Joan , so Lionel was a trifle more encouraged as he stood up and put on his jacket . He remembered everything that had been said in his house last night and prepared rebuttals . However , a strong uneasiness remained with him as he adjusted his tie and smoothed his cuffs . He recalled what Joan always told him : " It is shameful that you are subordinate to my brother , who is such a grim fool and has n't half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucks your brains . I know . What would he do without you ? He 's used you all your lives . You have the intelligence , not he . It 's shameful . Sometimes I ca n't bear it . " Lionel had at first laughed , knowing the truth . But lately he had started to listen to Joan . He had initially believed she spoke only out of her love for him . But insidiously his dissatisfaction had started to grow . He was no longer willing to " just plug along . " Besides , he had gone into debt to please and pamper Joan , to give her what she deserved . He had not done it lightly , but he had done it , even though it had assaulted his Celtic nature . The Irish avoided debt like the plague , for they had long memories , he would think to himself . He had put all his money into Schofield 's scheme . Though he was optimistic by nature , he was also pru/dent . He had many wakeful hours worrying about that twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing for it but to face Jason  --  Jason , whom he had never feared before ; Jason , who had suddenly become formidable . Lionel remembered the long-ago episode of the gold piece Jason had rejected on his fourteenth birthday , money desperatelyneeded by himself and his family . Principle ! There were more men of principle in the county poor farm than there were villains or fools . Lionel tried to stroll easily on the way to Jason 's office , and he forced himself to smile when he knocked on the door and then entered . He had expected an angry greeting , but he felt a sharp consternationwhen he saw Jason in the flesh . There was something like hatred in his flashing eyes . Jason saw that Lionel , as usual , was beautifully and stylishly dressed in a light blue Palm Beach suit , bought in New York . His white shirt and cuffs glistened . His red hair was perfectly groomed , his manner insouciant and casual . " Hello , " he said . " Sit down , " said Jason , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the clenched fists on the big desk , and the white clenched lips , the distended nostrils , the fierceness in the eyes that looked at him as at a hated stranger . " If it 's about last night . . . " Lionel began . Jason struck his desk with his fist . " It is . " He hardly parted his lips . " Why did you give Patricia whiskey last night , and make her drunk ? " Lionel was astounded , and Jason saw it . He did not know that Lionel had expected an attack because of Chauncey Schofield . " But that 's what she always drinks , mixed with sherry ! " Lionel blurted . " What ? " " She drinks that everywhere , for God 's sake , Jason ! Did n't you know ? I thought you gave it to her yourself , for Christ 's sake ! " Jason stared at him in a silence that seemed to charge the air . All at once Jason knew that Lionel was speaking the truth . Lionel never lied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid answering directly , or evade any question he did not want to answer . But he never lied to Jason . To others , yes . But not to his friend.  |p308Jason  slowly swiveled in his chair , and his profile was set . " What do you mean , everywhere ' ? " " It 's common talk , Jason , I swear to you . I heard it from Joan first , of course , and then from others . Patricia 's been drinking that mixture for years . I swear to God she has . And everyone thought you knew . " Jason was silent . He did not turn back to Lionel . He stared at the wall . Then he said slowly , " I did n't know . And neither does her father . " Lionel was so relieved that he felt faint . " Think for a minute , Jason . What would I have to gain doing something like that ? " " You never liked Patricia . " Jason 's voice was abstracted , for he was thinking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friend . I was shocked when you married her . You want the truth , do n't you ? I knew you . . liked her and wanted to marry her , but I had the idea . . . the idea that she was against it , and I was glad . I 'm sorry , Jason . I really am . But , good God , I would n't do anything to Patricia so as to hurt you . And I do n't believe you think I would , either . And if you did , did you ask yourself why ? " " I 've thought a million things , " said Jason , and put his head in his hands . " I believe you , Lionel . But you should have told me . " " I thought you knew , and so did Joan ! Why should I have embarrassedyou ? " Jason did not speak . Lionel went on , " Again , it 's common knowledge . I do n't know when it started , except it was long ago . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always drinks whiskey with sherry . I do n't know how it began . Do you mean Patricia does n't know , ei-ther ? " " She does n't . I accused her last night , and she almost went out of her mind . She hit me , and screamed . I believe her . She does n't know . But why . . . What does she . . . do when she . . . drinks with others ? " Lionel examined a cuff . " She prattles , I heard . About her family . Other people find it amusing . " Jason 's averted cheek twitched . " Do you know what she prattlesabout ? " Lionel hesitated . Jason turned suddenly to him , and his voice was frightening . " Tell me , if you know . "  | " I do n't know , personally . Only what I 've heard . Jason , do you want the truth or some nice lies ? " " The truth . " " Well . " Lionel sincerely hesitated . " You know she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I . . . did . . . not . " The words came painfully , slowly . " I knew their natures were n't . . . compatible . Patricia thinks he 's too . . . quiet , and she distrusts quiet people . It 's only her way . She thinks Sebastian is mischievous , too . I think she . . . misunderstandshim . The kid loves his mother . But Patricia can be . . . impatient with people she does n't understand . Dislike her own child ? No . I ca n't believe that . " Lionel said nothing . He thought of his little son being abused and mistreated by " that damned fool of a woman . " The thought had always angered him . Now he felt a surge of hatred for Patricia , a longing to take his son from her and her ugly house . But he swallowed quickly and controlled himself . " Well , Jason , that is the impression she gives other people  --  that she ca n't stand the poor kid . Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she talks always of the twins . She really loves them , especially Nick . I prefer Nicole , myself , " and he smiled honestly . But Jason hardly heard . He said , " Does she . . . prattle about me ? " When Lionel did not answer , Jason again fixed him with those unrecognizable eyes , which demanded an answer , and a truthful one . " Yes . To tell the truth . " Lionel was actually coloring . " Not as much as she does Sebastian . She feels that you do n't . . . well , understand her . She is always complaining of not having a house of her own , and she thinks you are partly to blame . She thinks you do n't appreciate what she calls the finer things of life . ' She says she is . . . stifling . Her own words . But , you know how women babble  --  " " No , I do n't . " Jason wondered why he did not feel much pain at this news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , too ? " " Yes . Quite often . She links you with him , as frustrating her , or some damn thing . But mostly she babbles gossip she has heard , or imagined . And talks of clothes and jewelry and fashion and actresses and actors she has seen or read about . Just chatter . " " And people find it amusing , I suppose . "  | " Well , you know how people are . And a lot are envious , too . " Jason nodded as if his head had become too heavy to be held upright . " Anything else ? " When Lionel did not answer , the hard fierce stare returned again . " Tell me . " " Oh , goddammit , Jason ! She tells everyone that she does n't . . . that she sleeps alone . That you are . . . gross or something . " Lionel 's color deepened . " I wish to God you had n't forced me to tell you ! " Jason 's chin fell on his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell you . I did n't want to . It 's a hell of a thing for a husband to hear , especiallyone who loves his wife . " Jason 's gaze did not waver as it rose again to Lionel 's face . " But I do n't love Patricia , " Jason said . " I 'm only sorry for her now . She 's the mother of my three children . There 's that . I suppose I still feel some affection for her , but that 's about all . I found that out last night . " He added , " And I found out that she never cared about me , either . " Lionel felt another jolt of fear . " Did she . . . want . . . someoneelse ? " " I do n't know . If she did , I never knew . And now I do n't care . In a way , it 's a relief to me . " He suddenly realized that he was confiding in Lionel as he always had , and was ashamed of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . " I wonder who started it , and why . The whiskey with sherry . " " God only knows . Maybe it started out as a joke . But she seemed to like it . " " I detest women who drink whiskey . I think they 're con-temptible . " " Do you , now , " said Lionel , and felt some anger . " Joan drinks whiskey , openly , and you know it . Your sister , my wife . Do you think women different from men ? I do n't like your insinuation that there 's something wrong with a woman who prefers whiskey to wine . " He went on , " There 's something straitlaced about you , Jason . These are new days . " " I 've been reminded of that , several times . " His thoughts were so confused , he found himself saying , " I never asked , never knew . Why did Molly marry Dugan ? " " There 's no secret about it ! A woman knows she needs a homep311and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her here but marriage . She may look and act like an old maid  --  we never did get along  --  but she 's a woman , after all . And Dugan , she reasoned , would be able to do things for our mother which we could n't do , at that time . And she liked him , I suppose . He 's a good catch for Molly , though what he saw in her , I do n't know . " Lionel smiled . " He could have married anybody . Perhaps she has hidden charms no one else ever saw . She 's a homely girl . " " No , " said Jason . " Molly 's beautiful . " Lionel thought nothing would astonish him after what he had already heard , but he was astonished again . " Molly ? Beautiful ? When did you find that out ? It is n't visible to anybody else . " Lionel laughed a little . Then , all at once , his foxlike eyes became yellow slits , watching . " Well , " said Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-looking . I do n't know . It does n't matter . Well . Thanks for telling me about Patricia , Lionel . " Lionel stood up . Then Jason said , " You 'll regret lending Schofield that money , friend . I 'm sorry to have to say it . " Lionel gave him a whimsical salute . " Thanks for your concern . But I have a feeling it will return to me a dozen times over . " And that was all that was said of Chauncey Schofield . After Lionel left , Jason sat alone in a turmoil of thought . He felt unbearably and incurably betrayed , rejected , and lonely beyond words . His pain increased . He had no one he could truly confide in , who would console him or cheer him , or who gave a damn about him . Molly.  |p313It  was , to Jason , astonishingly curious that that evening he went into Patricia 's quarters without his usual trepidation and hope for a smile or a word of conjugal kindness . The hope , he realized now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand his feeling of relief on this realization , his feeling of sudden freedom . He was like a man who had never known liberty and was all at once precipitated into it . It was confusing , but exhilarating too . It was also curious to him that Patricia had not only consented to marry him but had urged him into that marriage . Why ? Had it been because of the genial pressure of her father , and his own urgency ? He no longer believed that Patricia 's nature was vulnerable and delicate , so she had not succumbed out of exhaustion or persuasion . There was a wiry strength , he had discovered , in his wife , an obstinacy which would not yield , or , if yielding , remained obdurateand sullen . There had to be some hidden reason why she had consented to marry him , and Jason began to wonder what it was . Had her father bribed her ? She had a large inheritance of her own , but Patricia was always susceptible to money . He was no longer deceived that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruins of the huge breakfasts he had overlookeduntil now . He had loved her for what he had believed to be her daintiness , refinement , and fragility , all the feminine virtues he found enchanting . In the last twenty-four hours he had had a revelation : Patricia possessed none of these characteristics , and this astounded him . But it had set him free of an almost lifelong slavery . So he went with resolution and calm into her quarters . She wasp314sitting at her dressing-table mirror , staring thoughtfully at her image and rearranging her hair with a concentration he found faintly ludicrous . Her reflection was no longer exquisite to him . It was plain , and touched with a certain selfish grossness . What did she see there ? What I once saw , he thought , with mingled pity and bitter amusement . She turned to him abruptly , and frowned . But he was no longer disturbed at this expression . He said quietly , " I want to talk to you , Patricia , and please do n't interrupt until I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near her . He had not given her his usual pleading kiss . Patricia began to speak in her customary irritable fashion , and then she paused , staring . Jason had changed . He was looking at her with only remote interest , and she was startled . Patriciamight not be too intelligent , but she was acute . She liked power . All at once she realized that Jason had escaped her . He said , as she half-faced him on her stool , " I believe you , that you did not think that you were drinking whiskey last night . " " You ought to be ashamed , " she said . " You know how I hate spirits , and only drink wine . Yet you accused me  --  " Jason lifted his hand with authority , and startled again , she subsided , but with umbrage . " For a long time , Patricia , you have been given whiskey mixed with sherry , everywhere you go . " She gasped , affronted and incredulous . " How preposterous ! Do n't you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have known . Sherry can hide any adulteration . You had only two or three small glasses of sherry before dinner last night , and one or two glasses of wine during dinner . Not enough to put you in that . . . condition . You were drunk . Do you hear me ? You were drunk ! " " A lie , a lie , a filthy lie ! " she cried , and her long face turned a furious red . " You think anyone who laughs or jokes is drunk ! If someone smiles , you think he is drunk ! You and your grim face , like a stone ! " " Quiet , Patricia . Hear me out . " She struck her dressing table with a clenched hand . " It 's your ugly , crippled sister who told you that lie , that disgusting cripple ! She 's always hated me , because I 'm sound ! How Lionel could have married her . . . " Jason said , as if she had not spoken , " It was Lionel who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said it was common knowledge . He thought I knew . But I did n't . He thought that was what you wanted , and so he gave it to you . " A strange look came over her face . " Lionel ? " she said , and the name was a caress , something Jason missed , though he was aware of the sudden quiet which had come to Patricia . She was almost smiling . " Yes , Lionel . We had a talk this morning . I accused him of tricking you last night . You know how mischievous he is . But he 's never lied to me on important things . He 's my friend . He said everyoneknew about your sherry and whiskey . Some enemy , years ago , began it , to hurt you . " " Lionel said that ? " Her voice was soft and trembling . " Yes . " " He thought it was done to hurt me ? And that he gave it to me because he thought I wanted it ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her expression , her faint smile , made her almost pretty . Jason was puzzled . He had expected any reaction but this . His wife seemed to be not only touched but also happy . " How kind of him , " she murmured , " to want to help me . " " I suppose so , " said Jason , still puzzled . Patricia 's head had dropped . She was deep in reflection . Her love had tried to protect her ; her love had given her only what he thought she desired . So he had not forgotten those Sundays in the glade . He would never forget , as she would never forget . But why had n't he behaved like the romantic heroes she had read about in the novels  --  remaining celibate out of grief ? Patricia 's lips trembled with emotion . Her small breast rose and fell rapidly . She was both sorrowful and unbearably happy . Jason waited . He had never seen such an expression on Patricia'sface before , gently tender , exalted . Then she changed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks whiskey , and no one accuses her of being drunk ! " " Joan is used to whiskey , ever since she was a child . Da would give it to her when she had a toothache or stomachache , in hot water with lemon juice and sugar . You are n't used to it , Patricia . And whiskey can be lethal for the Irish , more so than for any other race . Your father drinks it , because he is used to it , and sop316am I. But we 're careful . We know just how far to go , though we 're tempted , often , to exceed that . We know how vulnerable we are . You are especially vulnerable . You 'll never get used to it , Patricia . Well . You must now be on your guard with your friends . ' You have enemies , as everyone else has , and they look for soft spots where they can hurt you . People are n't good , no matter what the priests say . No , they are not good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have no enemies ! " she shouted . " I have only friends ! You are the one who has enemies ! No one likes you or loves you , as they do me ! " Jason sighed . How silly she was . He said , " There is such a thing as envy , Patricia , and it 's cruel . You are probably envied . " This pleased her . Her fast breath slowed . Jason saw his advantage . " Yes , you are envied , dear , for your position and . . . style . So , be careful after this , wo n't you ? " Her pleasure increased . She actually gave him a friendly smile . In a meek voice he had never heard before , she said , " Well , thank you , Jason . I will be careful . But why anyone should envy me . . . " He stood up . " They do , dear . Envy is a common human sin . And so , be careful . " He touched her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat reassured . Patricia did not even see him go . Lionel . He had wanted to protect her . He never forgot . Lionel , Lionel . She thought of writing him a loving note in gratitude . But her native caution advised against this . She would remember , however , to whisper her thanks to him the next time they met , and to press his dear hand tightly . She felt an urgent thirst for sherry . She looked forward to it . It did not occur to her that it was not sherry she now so ardently desired ; she only knew she must have a glass almost immediately . Humming , smiling at her image in the mirror , she continued her toilet . Natural color touched her cheeks and lips . Her chronic depression lifted . She was a girl again , waiting for the meetings in the glade , in enchanted sunlight and summer warmth . She often ate dinner alone , for her father and husband frequentlydined at the Inn-Tavern or Ipswich House , with guests . She drank her two glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thinking . Then she looked at her glass . What insipidp317cheap sherry her father served ! It was bland and tasteless . She wondered . She looked at the bottle . Her favorite Bristol cream . She suspected Patrick of filling the original bottle with thrifty substitutes . Scowling , she went to the wine cabinet in the dining room and looked for a sealed bottle . She furtively opened one and drank from it without a glass . Bland . Strange she had n't noticed it before . She drank some wine , a large glass of it . It warmed her . But still she was unsatisfied , and it came to her that when she had dinner at home she had experienced this dissatisfaction before , this mysterious craving . Then she shrugged . When did whiskey ever hurt anyone ? Especiallythe small amounts she had been drinking in sherry ? Hesitating , afraid , she thought of the dank dark cellar , with spiders , where Patrick kept his hard liquor . She looked at the locked part of the dining-room wine cabinet , then furtively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscrewing the hinge . She went upstairs for a steel nail file . Then , kneeling again in the dim silence , she hurriedly , almost frantically turned the screws . The door opened ; the screws dropped on the carpet . She filled her wineglass with a large portion of whiskey , then cleverly replaced the screws and locked the door . She sat in the library , and the familiar euphoria soon embraced her . She thought only of Lionel , and she was filled with joy and desire and passion . She sipped . Then she dozed , still smiling , until the dinner bell rang more and more peremptorily . Sluggishly she obeyed its call , and ate alone , staring with shining eyes into the distance . She ate very little tonight . After dinner she climbed upstairs to her room and fell onto her bed , dreaming happily of the glade and Lionel 's embraces . When she awoke at midnight , and the house slept , she went downstairs and again opened the whiskey cabinet . This time she shrewdly replaced the loss with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would blame the servants . That would never do . He would only buy a lock that could not be picked . Then she thought of Tim , the handyman . He was a sly , exigent man . He could be bought  --  and he could buy her the whiskey she now knew she could not resist . But whiskey never hurt anyone . Did it ? One just had to be careful . It was not that she drank . She just needed the surcease from pain  --  and the visions of Lionel . Everyonep318needed something , did n't they ? Life was very dull at its best , especially in Belleville . Jason forgot to go into his wife 's bedroom the next morning for the first time since they were married . He ate breakfast alone with Patrick . On the hall table he found another letter from his brother , John . He made a mouth . Letters from the priest exasperated him , always , and he usually delayed reading them . He put it in his pocket and went upstairs again to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the day as his holiday , and Lionel would take Independence Day . Nicole and Nicholas and Sebastian were already waiting for him , corpulent little Nicole sedate in spite of her absurd dress of fluffy Swiss eyelet voile with its rows of stiff French lace on almost every inch , and her slippers with immense black silk bows , and her curled hair topped by anotherhuge bow of white silk . She wore a sash of bright pink silk about her thick waist , and the great bow perched on her substantialrear like a rudder . She was quite aware of the grotesquerie of her mother 's choice , but bore it with her customary resignation and dignity . Her gray eyes this morning were the color of a sunlit sea at dawn , and Jason , looking fondly down at her , felt a warm glow of love for his small daughter . " Hello , Grandma , " he said , gently pinching her cheek . She smiled at him , and her face flashed with dimples . " Hello , Sonnyboy , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the balls of his feet , fervid and flushed as always and shouting incoherently . Nicole put a firm hand on his shoulder , and he subsided a little . He pushed a new toy , a jack-in-the-box , at his father , making the lid slap up and down . " Look , look ! " he shrieked . " It jumps , bang , bang , bang ! Look , look ! " " I see , " said Jason , and smoothed the damp lank hair back from his son 's forehead . The child bounced like the toy itself , and he gasped and his eyes gleamed senselessly . Nicole took his arm , murmured something , and the boy looked at her as at a strongmindedmother and fell silent . Sebastian , as usual , waited quietly . Jason felt quite foolish at the surge of love he felt for his older son and the recognition of fellowship and , indeed , friendship . He held out his hand to the young boy , and Sebastian gravely took it . They shook hands like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blazing light and a hot wind heavy withp319the scent of roses . A few days ago Patricia had said with vexation , " Are you going to take the children to the cemetery this year , Jason ? " " Yes , " he had replied . The gardener had prepared two large bunches of flowers , wrapped in wet paper . Jason took his children downstairs , not pausing at Patricia 's door as he would have done only last week . It was not deliberate ; he simply did not think of her . The man and his children got into the waiting red Cadillac , with its fawn canvas top folded down . He guided the automobile through the silent sunlitstreets , under the dancing shade trees , over rough cobbles and then smooth macadam . It was very early . A few men were out hosing down the hot grass ; a very few children sat on porches under awnings . It was a pleasant day . Jason thought that , after all , it was good to be alive , it was good to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such children , it was good to be prosperous , even if in debt . He sweltered in his somber black mourning suit , but even that was not unbearable . It was exactly the sort of day , he thought , to visit a cemetery . Even sorrow was almost sweet on a day like this , and if the dead knew of it , they would rejoice , too . He smiled at the idea . The dead knew nothing ; they were beyond joy and pain , sadness and celebration , and perhaps that was good , too . He had not gone to Mass this morning . There was nothing to pray for in church , where the adversary lived with an unchanging face and a changelessheart  --  if he indeed had one . Only Sebastian remembered last Decoration Day , for the twins had been too young to go to visit Kate 's grave . " This time , " said Sebastian , " we see Grandpa 's grave , do n't we ? " " Grandpa , Grandpa ! " screamed Nicholas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't bring my jack-in-theboxto show Grandpa ! " " Grandpa 's in heaven , " said Nicole severely . " Do be quiet , Nick . " Nicholas bounced even more fervently . " In heaven , in heaven , we all go to heaven ! " " Perhaps , " said Nicole , and again , and more firmly , quieted him . Sebastian sat beside Jason , leaning against his shoulder . " Do you think Grandpa will know we are visiting his grave , Papa ? " Jason knew he should say , " Of course he will know . " But one did not lie to Sebastian or croon reassurance that a child likep320Sebastian did not need anyway . So Jason said , " I do n't know , dear . No one knows . " Nicole said in her steadfast voice , " Everybody knows , Papa . " Jason thought of what Lionel had said lately about the little girl : " What a reverend mother she will make , if she decides she has a vocation . God help the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novices . She reminds me of old Sister Agatha . " With which , after a moment 's reflection , Jason had to agree , laughing . " If there is such a thing as reincarnation , then Nicole is either my great-great-grandmother or Sister Agatha . " Sister Agatha had died six years ago , indomitable and irascible to the very last , even when she had listened with daunting attention to Father Sweeney 's litany for the dying . " It was an intimidating experience , " he confessed later to Jason . " I felt as if I were still stumbling over my catechism . " He had paused . " I expected her to reach for her switch , paralyzed though she was . " They reached the cemetery , Holy Cross . It was very small and filled with cheap little headstones and small crosses and crumbling urns . But it was crowded with people , old and young , bearing flowers and pots of geraniums . The silence was broken by voices praying aloud , chatting to friends , and even scolding children . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a clattering lawnmower over some graves , and it was a comforting sound in this little garden for the dead . Jason led the way first to his parents ' grave . Kate lay beside her husband , Peter , and Bernardlay next to her . There was a very small headstone on the first two graves  --  " Katherine Garrity , Peter Garrity . RIP . " Jason had put a temporary wooden cross on Bernard 's grave , until the marbleone would arrive . He let the solemn Nicole lay the flowers on her grandparents ' graves . Her dignity was never more manifest , her movements slow and careful . She then watched her father place flowers on Bernard'sgrave . Jason looked down at the still-raw earth , and his face darkened and tightened . Sebastian took his hand in wordless sympathy . No one noticed , at first , that Nicholas had run away among the gravestones . It was Nicole who first was aware of his absence . " Oh , that awful boy ! " she exclaimed . " I hear him screaming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with amazing speed on her short fat legs , and soon reached Nicholas , who had paused besidep321an elderly weeping couple , man and wife , who were kneeling by a new grave and sobbing . He was demanding to know why they were crying , and his shrill voice vexed the mourners who stared at him . Nicole reached him , took his arm in a hard grip , apologized to the annoyed couple , and led her brother away , scolding him quietly . " You must n't disturb people , " she said . " They come to be with their dead . " " I 'm not dead , dead , dead ! " he shrieked excitedly , and tried to tear himself loose . But Nicole 's grip was too strong , and she almostdragged him back to her father and brother . He began to cry loudly , and tears ran down his twitching face . Released , he ran to Jason and clutched his thighs and jabbered fresh incoherencies , pointing to Nicole accusingly . Jason patted his head . Then he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a trowel . " I bring flowers for Bernie , Jason , " he said . He smiled under his trim white mustache and looked shyly at the younger man . " And say a prayer for the repose of his soul . " " If he has one , he is n't reposing , " said Jason . " He 's probably somewhere else , raising hell , " and he smiled his gratitude at Saul . " Or having a drop of the creature while arguing with the Devil . " Saul smiled in silence and shook his head . The children watched him as he stiffly knelt and dug a small hole for the flowerpot . When it was planted , Saul replaced his hat , stood up , bent his head and clasped his hands , and quietly prayed in Hebrew . Then , to Jason 's curiosity , he looked about him , found a smooth white stone , and laid it on an arm of the wooden cross . " What does that mean ? " asked Jason . Saul hesitated . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grave the sleeper knows you have been there . You have n't forgottenhim . " " Oh , " said Jason . He did not know why tears flooded his eyes . He blinked hard and turned to his children . " Saul , you know my older boy , Sebastian , and the twins , Nick and Nickie . Nickie 's the girl , an old lady . " Gravely Saul and Sebastian shook hands . Nicole made an awkwardcurtsy . Nicholas stared and hummed . It came to Jason that the child was never quiet . If not screaming demandingly , he hummed like a telephone wire in a wind , and as meaninglessly . His eyes never ceased their jumping . For the first time Jason felt ap322twinge of uneasiness . The child was never really still , not even when he slept . He churned up his bed and tangled his sheets with his small thin arms and legs . He often dangerously choked when eating , for he could not stop chattering . " You have dear children , Jason , " said Saul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas . " You are blessed , " said Saul . " I hope so , " said Jason . Nicole had taken her brother 's hot little hand and was holding it still , like a controlling mother . Sebastian was looking at the stone on the cross . His tall young body , clad in a white suit with brass buttons , was motionless , and all at once Jason thought that the child was not really a child . He was a man in a child 's body . Tears gathered again in Jason 's eyes . Nicholas screamed , " I want to go pee-pee ! Now ! " " All right , " said Nicole , and looked toward the distant fence , where a few bushes bristled , and led her twin away . Saul and Jason and Sebastian laughed . They watched the little ones hurryingaway . " Nickie 's really his mother , " said Jason . " She 's the only one who can subdue him . " Sebastian watched his brother and sister until they disappeared behind the bushes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I must get back to the shop , " said Saul . " Even on a holiday , the people , they come . For milk and bread they 've forgotten , though it 's illegal to sell . " He spread out his hands . " But one must live . " He shook hands with Jason and Sebastian and trotted off , natty as always in his old pressed suit , carrying his trowel . " He 's a good man , " said Sebastian . " And that makes him rare , " said Jason . Sebastian glanced up at him quickly , his agate eyes understanding , and again Jason had the thought that his son was a man , not a child . Jason said , " Two weeks ago , Sebastian , some bad people came here and overturned the urns and the headstones and scrawled obscenities on them . They do n't like Catholics . " Sebastian nodded , as if accepting the wickedness of humanity . " People do n't like each other , Papa . " " I wonder why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other children were returning . Jason felt a hard jolt in his chest . They were accompanied by Molly Dugan , whose armsp323were filled with flowers . Molly had bent her head and was listeningintently to Nicole , and smiling . Nicholas had begun to run in tight circles down the path and over the grass . He was like a wound-up top which never stopped whirling . Molly looked at Jason and smiled . " Hello , " she said in her quiet voice , as firm as Nicole 's . Jason could not answer . He could only look into Molly 's golden eyes and admire her tall pretty figure clad in a pale green linen dress , simple and unadorned . Suddenlyhe was aware of no one else , not even his children . His heart had set up an intense throbbing . He felt a mixture of immeasurablejoy and pain and longing and harsh desire . His mouth had become dry , with a metallic taste . Molly 's eyes widened on him . She was flushing like a startled young girl . Then she half-turned aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Her voice was unsteady , her wide mouth uncertain . She plucked a rosebud from her bunch of blossoms and bent and laid it gently on Bernard 's grave . " I loved him , too , " she said . She looked up at Jason , and her eyes were wet . " I loved him . . . " " Everybody loved Da , " said Nicole , who was looking from her father to Molly , and seeing everything . " He said he knew you when you were little , like us , Aunt Molly . " " Yes , dear , " said Molly . She looked only at the grave . " I used to visit your Auntie Joan . " ( " Why do you think she was always in your house ? " Patricia had cried . ) Jason 's voice was hoarse . " Where 's Daniel ? " he asked " tie 's in Boston . Some hysterical client asked him to come . " Molly 's tone was neutral . " There 's a bench over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nickie , watch Nick , and Sebastian , you watch them both . " He was trembling . Molly seemed startled again . She glanced up and saw Sebastian clearly , as she had never seen him before . There had been times when she had sensed a vague resemblance to someone in the child , but the recognition invariably fleeted away , leaving her uneasy and unsettled and puzzled . Sebastian was looking at her seriously , and the sun lit up his curls , and they were on fire in the sun , as fiery as her own hair . And she saw , in that light , the yellow flashes in hisp324large eyes , the band of ginger freckles across his nose and over his pale fine cheeks , and the graceful posture of his child 's body . Forgetting even Jason and her joy in the sight of him , she said to herself , in real anguish , " Oh , no , no , no ! " She was rememberingher alarm over Patricia 's meetings with Lionel ; she was remembering the plea she had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering her denunciations of her brother , her fear for Patricia . Now she could not take her terrified gaze from Sebastian ; she was remembering , too , that he was a " seventh-month child . " A full-term child  --  Lionel 's son . Her own flesh and blood . And that surprising and precipitate marriage of Patricia and Jason . She had been numbed by it , had been unable to feel much after she had heard of it . For a long time , reality had become blurred , for her grief had been overwhelming . She had never fully remembered the next few months . They had been like a long and deadly nightmare , with shadows voiceless and inchoate . She had moved among them . As she stood near Jason now , she felt cold and insubstantial . Jason was watching her . He saw her pallor . Only her dress and her hair and eyes had color . She looked desperately sick . He moved closer to her and put his hand on her partly bare arm . It was as chill as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops on her forehead , too . " Molly , " he said . " Is there something wrong ? " He was frightened . She tried to speak , but it was some moments before she could . Then she almost whispered , " No . Not really . No . I think it 's the sun . " She could look at him now ; her eyes were great with suffering , and he did not know it was for him . Then her eyes filled with tears . She felt his warm hand on her flesh . She wanted to put her hand over his , to press it closer to her . Then she turned away . " I must go , " she said . She had dropped her flowers on the grave . Then , before Jason could speak again , she stumbled blindly away . Jason watched her go . An enormous emptiness surrounded him , an enormous loneliness . He watched until she disappeared through the gate . " Molly , " he said aloud , and the sun seemed to have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of his own emotions . He had known Molly since early childhood ; he had disliked her , avoided her , condemned her in his boy 's irrational judgment.  |p325He  had thought her ugly and uncouth . When had he stopped believingall this ? He could not remember . All these years he had reiterated his old aversion for Molly . When had he stopped ? It must have been a long time ago , though he had been unaware of it himself . Had he been trying to avoid the truth ? Surely his " new " indifference to Patricia had not been sudden , but had been growingover the past few years , while he consciously tried to deny it . Jason , standing alone and almost unbearably desolate in the littlecemetery , recalled his grandfather 's real horror and grief at his marriage to Patricia . He had mentioned Molly ; Jason had been repelled . Was it then that he had begun to think of Molly , and had obliterated the thought because of his old illusions concerning Patricia ? God help me , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions had existed for a long time , working like diligent moles in the very center of his ordered essence , his tidy lawn that he had cultivated . Had that cultivation contained a little frantic despera-tion ? It seemed to him , as his desolation increased , that he had alwaysloved Molly , even while fighting against that love . The recognitionhad not been an abrupt holocaust . The meeting in Patrick'soffice had been a volcanic explosion of truth that could no longer be denied . But at least , he thought , I am now free of the fantasy of what I thought a woman should be . There was some sadness in this thought ; one does not relinquish dreams that easily , but he knew now that Molly loved him , too , and probably always had . He felt no betrayal of his marriage . In reality , he had never reallybeen wedded to Patricia . He had married a lie , but the deceptionwas his , not Patricia 's . She was only herself , which , he thought grimly , is not true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Molly married Daniel , if she had loved him , Jason ? Stop it , he thought . Am I trying to condemn her again ? What right have I to criticize ? What right have I to feel doubly betrayed ? I betrayedMolly from the very beginning . I betrayed both myself and Patricia . All at once the sun became brilliant as it had never been brilliantbefore . He was suddenly filled with an ecstatic trembling . What did it matter if conditions were impossible ? He was in love for the first time in his life . Everything took on meaning , excitementand promise.  |p326He  did not ask himself , as yet , what the promise was which so illuminated everything around him . He only knew that life had becomeinfinitely richer , more significant . The world had become a joyous place , a gorgeously painful place , where pain was only part of rapture and enhanced it . He felt reborn . He called his children to him . Sebastian and Nicole , side by side , walked sedately , a middle-aged couple . Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his happiness , Jason felt uneasy and watched the little boy racing toward him . " Lively , alive , " Patricia had said of him . But Nicholas did not fit these easy phrases . There was something wrong . When the family returned home , Jason was informed that his wife wished to see him in her bedroom . Jason frowned . He had no desire to see Patricia now . But he had no right to destroy her . He went upstairs to her rooms , and she was lying on her chaise longue in a mannered posture of melancholy abandonment which Jason now recognized as one of her many affectations . But he was patient . After all , what had happened was not her fault ; the fault lay with him . " Yes , Patricia ? " he said . He felt nothing at all for her except a faint compassion and a faint guilt . He stood near the door . He did not rush to her as he always had in the past , full of anxious concernand solicitude . Patricia half sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intruding stranger . " It 's late , " she said , and he noticed the shrill whining note in her voice . " Have you forgotten we go to the Clarks ' for dinner tonight ? " He looked at his watch . " Not for three hours . " She stared at him , frowning . He was different . He was not the abject slave she had known from childhood , always wanting to appeaseher . " Why take children to a cemetery , Jason ? They should be spared the knowledge of death . " " Why ? " She was taken aback . " Why ? It is n't healthy . " " Death is as natural as life . It 's part of living , Patricia . Kids ca n't be taught that early enough . Why fill their lives with bogey-men ? " " My father never used to take me to my mother 's grave . "  | " He was wrong . " She became angrily animated . " I do n't think so ! How can a child live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's sake ! They see it every day in the world around them . Do you think they are stupid ? To deny death is to make a liar of a parent , Patricia . And kids always see through lies , and then they begin to despise their parents for telling them . " " You 've changed , " she said . " Have I ? " He did not know that his usually impassive face was glowing like a youth 's . " Yes . And I do n't like it . " He turned away . He said involuntarily , " You 'll have to get used to it . " He left the room . Patricia fell back on her cushions . He was not the man she had known only yesterday . He had escaped her . She felt powerless . This enraged her . She got to her feet , went to her locked dressing table , and took out a bottle of whiskey . She did not wait to get a glass . She lifted the bottle to her lips and drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said aloud , and drank again . " He 'll find out ! " She thought of her father , and smiled vindictively . Her father always listened to her , even if sometimes he frustrated and denied her . It was time he got over his infatuation for Jason . " I 'll see to it ! " she said , and triumphantly raised the bottle like an avenging sword . Then all at once it became a toast to Lionel , and her face was alive and happy.  |p329It  was Jason 's habit , and duty , to make a tour of Ipswich House every morning . He consulted the housekeeper , a very diligent and intelligent widow , who ruled the maids with a stern hand . She never smiled , except at Jason . He called her " Sergeant , " to which she did n't object . Her name was Mrs. Gruber , and she was spare and gray and convinced of the evil of humanity , and was never tolerant of foibles . She knew what often happened in the hotel , and while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the " sinfulness " of mankind . God would judge  --  one of these days ! She lived for that . In the meantime , she had a shrewd eye for trickery and lies . Especiallyif they involved money and the cost of insurance to the hotel . In many ways she regarded the hotel not only as her responsibility and domain , but as her very own . She deeply respectedJason , even if she did believe he was a little careless at times about the " goings-on . " Men ! She met him this morning when he was on his rounds , her arms folded over her flat breast , her face forbidding . Seeing this , he said , " Now what , Sergeant ? " " It 's Mrs. Bristol  --  again , sir . " Mrs. Gruber 's face , the texture and color of wood , became darker than ever . Her hair was gray and thin , though , incongruously , the tiny knot on the back of her head was set off by an elaborate Spanish comb crowded with glass jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her character , which was uncompromising and humorless . She wore a gray calico dress over her slatlike body , and a stiff white apron with anotherincongruity  --  an embroidered frill of pink . " What 's her complaint this time ? "  |p330Mrs  . Gruber looked justified . " I 'm sure it 's not my business , sir , but I always had my doubts about Mrs. Bristol . " Mr. and Mrs. Bristol were from New York , and the most elaboratesuite in Ipswich House was usually occupied by them from June first until long after Labor Day , and they often returned then for the Christmas holidays . Mr. Bristol was a financier , treated by several New York banks with awe . He was a handsome and impressiveman , about sixty years old , with white hair and what peoplecalled a " fine figure . " He was a considerable athlete , and had a courtly manner and rich voice . " Fruity , " Jason described it . He also had a way of touching one when he was speaking , which was somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his granddaughter , and indeed he had a granddaughter her age , about twenty-one . She was his third wife , and had been a chorus girl with Ziegfeld 's Follies . She was very beautiful and svelte , with pale gilt hair that shone even in faint light , a square exquisitely tinted complexion , widely spaced large blue eyes , a tiny nose , and a voluptuous pink mouth . She possessed a quantity of jewelry which an empress would not have despised , and a wardrobe that screamed of Worth and was very daring . In short , she was distracting , the envy of all the ladies and the dazzlement of every gentleman . She was almost illiterate , and her grammar and syntax made the less enchanted wince , including Jason . Her voice was almost a screech , and her laughter raucous . In ten years , Lionel once said , she would look like a haggard whore , for even now her manners were coarse and cheap for all her finery and furs and gems . She was flirtatious and had a habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had originated in Hoboken and it was whisperedthat her father was a " gandy dancer , " one who worked on the beds of railroads . However , Mrs. Bristol boasted that her paternalparent had been a " fame-us " physician , and her mother a familiar of Lillian Russell . She was often alone , for Mr. James Bristol was absent a great deal on business in New York , leaving his young wife for considerableperiods . She was never seen during the day , during which she slept luxuriously in her silken bed , and appeared only at night in one of her magnificent gowns that revealed half her full breasts . The gentlemen did not mind ; the ladies said uncharitable things.  |p331Mrs  . Bristol was accompanied by her maid , a shrewd-faced little woman with a French accent that occasionally slipped into the cadence of pure Brooklynese . Her name was Elise . Mrs. Bristol 's name was Flora , and she was always asking bewitched gentlemen to call her that , though she never requested it of ladies . With the latter she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airs and said she hardly added " tone " to Ipswich House . But the suite cost a fortune by the week , and so no one , except Mrs. Gruber , objected . Flora Bristol , however , was a trial to the hotel help , for she alleged to have a very sensitive stomach  --  like Patricia , Jason often reflected . She was never served a dish which did not have to go back to the kitchen in exchange for another , and she was critical of the wines . Her husband adored her , it was most obvious , and never returned from New York without a costly gift . When she wished , she was most ingratiating and made what the waiters called " eyes . " She also danced like a sylph and was much in demand in the ballroom . " What seems to be the trouble , Mrs. Gruber ? " Jason asked this morning . " She 's howling . She says someone stole her diamond lavaliere and earrings and her diamond bracelet . Worth , she says , one hundredthousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aghast . It was the first theft ever reportedat Ipswich House . " When did she miss them ? " " Just an hour ago . She suspects Hattie , the chambermaid , and the waiter who brought her her breakfast two hours ago  --  in bed . " Mrs. Gruber emphasized the last two words as if they were more reprehensible than the claimed theft . She drew a heavy breath . " I do n't believe a word of it . " Jason , still shaken , scrutinized the little woman , whose intelligencehe never underrated . " Why not ? " " I think it was her . . . brother , Mr. Carstairs , if that 's his name . " " Her brother ? " " Yes , sir . He came four days ago . Mr. Bristol 's away , as usual . Mr. Carstairs checked in after Mr. Bristol left . He 's a businessman , she says . He left early this morning . He occupied Mr. Bristol 's bedroom . " Mrs. Gruber sniffed roughly . " She says . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He checked in ? That can be verified , of course . "  | " I checked . He did , sir . " " Good . What sort of a man is he ? " " Very elegant . Very handsome . Looks like Francis X. Bushman . Of the moving pictures , sir . Him who plays with Beverly Baine in all those love stories . Scandalous . People ai n't got any shame these days , sir , and the moving pictures are all to blame . People kissing in them and huggin ' and whatnot . Police should stop ' em . Bad for children to see . " But Jason was perturbed . While he was considering , Mrs. Gruber added , " Do n't look the least like Mrs. Bristol . Her brother . Got black hair and brown eyes and dark skin . " " You do n't think he is really her brother ? " Mrs. Gruber hesitated . " Well . No . I got two daughters ; one 's fair , like . . . her , and the other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that with Mrs. Bristol and her .. . brother . " " He 's never been here before ? " " No , sir . And he do n't talk like Mrs. Bristol , who 's got that funny New York accent . He talks almost like a gentleman . " " Like Mr. Bristol ? Mr. Bristol is also from New York . " Jason could not help smiling . Mrs. Gruber tossed her head . " Mr. Bristol is a cultured gentleman , and this man sounds a little like that , only like a stage actor . Like he 's pretending , or imitating . Like Mrs. Bristol 's maid , who pretends she 's French , when half the time she forgets and sounds like Mrs. Bristol . " The suite consisted of two large bedrooms , finely and distinctivelyfurnished , an even more royal sitting room , and a huge marblebathroom with gilt fittings . The maid , Elise , occupied a small bedroom on the fourth floor , where other live-in servants slept , those from other towns . " I think I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason . " Knock hard on the door , sir . She do n't often wear clothes when she 's in there . Chambermaid told me . " Jason had a fleeting vision of the delectable Flora Bristol in the nude , and for an instant had the hope he could surprise her . He went up the marble stairs to the second floor and knocked on the carved and ornate door of the suite . He heard a loud sob , a woman 's consoling voice ; then the door opened , to show the wiz/ened face of Elise and her scowling little black eyes . She dropped a curtsy and said , " Entrez , s'il vous plait , m'sieu . " Flora was in bed , in a froth of silk and lace and , alas a satin bed jacket . Her pale gilt hair was loose down her back and over the pillows , though her lovely breast was far from being entirely concealed . She looked delicious , for all her tears . The great bedroom was filled with wafts of perfume , very expensive . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were oddly without redness . She smiled wanly at Jason , whom she consideredto be very attractive , though obdurate to her charms . She held out a languid hand to him . He noticed , as he had before , that her hands were very large for all they were smooth , and that the nails were flat and broad . " I 'm sorry to hear about your jewelry , Mrs. Bristol , " said Jason , sitting down near the bed while Elise kept an alert distance . " Tell me about it . I understand your brother was here for a few days . Did you notice the loss before or after he left ? " " Theo . It was before . Was n't it , Elise ? " " Oui , madame . " " And he did n't report it to the desk ? " " I . . . I do n't know . I do n't think so . He was in a hurry for his train . He has big business in New York . He 's a broker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her voice was husky , in considerable contrast with her dainty appearance . " So I told Mrs. Gruber , the housekeeper . I just know who took it ! Hattie , the chambermaid ! She 's always staring around , looking for something . Or it could be the breakfast waiter , that Herman . Has a sneaky look on him ; and he ca n't talk English , either . Just German , I think . " Hattie Eisen was a middle-aged farmwoman of great integrity , and had worked for years in the Inn-Tavern . Her husband 's farm was poor , and she " helped out , " as she called it . Patrick also " helped out , " by buying almost all the hotel 's fresh fruit from the little farm , and sweet butter for the guests who preferred it . HermanHeinz , the waiter , was quite old , a silent and earnest bachelor , also a longtime employee of Patrick 's , and of honorable Mennonitestock . " That Hattie was fiddling around my dressing table this morning with her duster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She took a long time , longer than usual . And Herman loi/tered around there , too . That was just a minute after Elise came in . Was n't it , Elise ? " Elise moistened thin purplish lips and said , " Oui , madame . " She looked at Jason with cunning cruel eyes . Then she said , withoutan accent , " I wondered what they both were doing there , right at that dressing table , together . Now we know . They were in it to-gether . " Jason said sternly , " That 's a dangerous accusation , Elise . You did n't really see anything , did you ? " " I saw them moving their hands , side by side . The jewelry was laid out , where Madame left it last night before she went to bed . " " You saw her lay it there ? " The eyes shifted . Then the woman said , " Well , m'sieu , she alwayslays it there , for me or Mr. Bristol to put it in their little safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason pounced . " Is n't it your duty to help Mrs. Bristol get to bed ? " Again the eyes shifted , and this time nervously . The woman darted a look at her mistress . " Well , not last night , sir . It was late , and Mrs. Bristol said I need n't stay up after eleven , waiting for her , and I could go to bed , as she 'd be dancing most of the night . " " So you do n't know if the jewelry was there last night , as usual ? " Jason 's voice had become hard . " What 're you trying to insinuate , Mr. Garrity ? " cried Flora , sittingstraight up in bed . " I 'm not insinuating anything , Mrs. Bristol . I 'm just trying to get a clear picture of when the jewelry was last seen . You saw it last ? " " Yes , I did ! What do you mean ? " Jason shrugged . " Elise , you do n't know if the jewelry was there last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't been , Mrs. Bristol 'd have noticed it . She had to take it off herself , did n't she ? " Her tone was challenging and impudent . " If it had been gone before she went to bed , she 'd have noticed , would n't she ? " " I do n't know . I 'm the one asking questions , if you please . " Jason turned to Flora , whose great blue eyes reflected anger and . . . Was it fear , too ? He wondered . " Have you notified your husband , Mrs. Bristol ? " " Elise is going to send him a telegram and ask him to come back right away . " Flora fell against her pillows and wiped her eyes . " He 'll be so mad . It cost a fortune . My wedding gift three years ago . Made by Cartier 's . " " I 'll send the telegram myself , " said Jason , standing up . " In the meantime , you should look for it . You might have placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , in the bathroom , under the rugs , and on the windowsills . Everywhere ! It 's gone ! " " I think we should call the police , " said the maid . Flora sobbed . " We 'll wait till Mr. Bristol gets here and takes charge of things . He would n't want trouble . The police are so nasty , so nosy . " " Yes , they do ask embarrassing questions , do n't they ? Mrs. Bristol , what is your brother 's address ? " She dropped her lace handkerchief , and now he definitely saw fear in her eyes . " My brother ? His address ? He . . . he 's just moved . I guess he put his new address on the book downstairs . When he checked in . " She moistened lips which had gone quite dry . " Mr. Garrity . . . " Her voice was pleading . " My husband does n't like Theo . You see . . . well , Daddy left a lot of money , and Theo does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . It 's in our blood , the stage . Ma worked with Lillian Russell , though she did n't need to . Mr. Bristol do n't like stage people . " Jason smiled without humor . " He liked you , did n't he , Flora ? " " Well , yes . " The frightened eyes dropped demurely . " He insisted on taking me away from it , though . I was only seventeen . He ... he met me at a party . Oh , Mr. Garrity , please do n't tell Mr. Bristol Theo was here ! It would make him so mad ! " " I thought you said your brother was a broker . " " I . . . well , he was . Then he went on the stage . Just for fun . " " But your brother is really a stockbroker ? " " Yes , yes ! He 's just on the stage , for fun , for a little while . " " What 's the name of the play in New York ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York yet . Just trying out in Pitts-burgh . " " What 's the theater ? "  | " Oh , Jesus ! What has that to do with it ? " " Nothing , perhaps . And the jewelry was gone before he left ? " " Yes ! No . Oh , Jesus , you 've got me all mixed up ! Maybe it was before or afterward . " Jason fixed his sharp gray eyes on her . " Mrs. Bristol . The name of the theater , please , and the play . In Pittsburgh . " " I do n't know ! Oh , God , get out of here ! I thought you 'd help , and have that Hattie and Herman arrested , with no fuss ! But all you want to do is make trouble for me and Mr. Bristol and my brother ! Get out ! You just wait until my husband gets here , that 's all ! " " What are you going to tell your husband ? " Jason 's voice was inexorable . " Tell him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what ! Practically saw them do it myself ! " The stupid thing is n't the best of liars , thought Jason . He looked at Elise . She was enjoying herself . There 's no love lost there , thought Jason , again grimly amused . I wonder how much she bribed the woman to lie ? The fool does n't know she 's laid herselfopen to blackmail for life . He said , " Mrs. Bristol , I 'd like to talk to you alone , if you please . Alone . " He felt a little pity for the girl , married to a man old enough to be her grandfather . She had married him for money and position , of course , and it had been a bad bargain , perhaps . James Bristol was entirely too " fruity , " and there was sometimes a brutal glint in his eyes . At one time , it had been reported to Jason , he had literally dragged his young wife from the dance floor when she had been somewhat too provocative with her partner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , unless matters became very suspicious and sinister . The girl was almost beside herself . " I do n't want to talk to you alone , for Christ 's sake ! You do n't want to help , you bastard ! All you want to do is save your damned hotel from trouble . Frig you , mister ! Get the hell out of here ! My husband will deal with you , and it 'll cost you a fortune ! " Jason studied her . Now all the sweetness and daintiness were gone , and a tough young harridan was there , full of obscenities as well as fear . He said , " Do you want me to talk to you in front of Elise , Mrs. Bristol , or would you prefer private interrogation ? From me , or the police ? If you wo n't talk to me , then I 'm callingp337the police immediately . Make up your mind . I want to help you , if you 'll let me . I want to save you from embarrassing questions by the police and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent man , and I do n't think he 'd like the publicity . . . and all the scandal . " " Scandal ! " she yelled . She pushed her perfect legs from under the silken sheets , and Jason had a good look at them . The full white breast was almost bare now , and heaving . Her lovely face had lost all its color . " What do you mean , scandal ? " " I 'd like to discuss that alone with you . " She looked at Elise . " All right ! " she screamed . " Get out ! Do n't come back until I ring for you , dammit ! " There was a charged silence while Elise , with visible regret , left the room and closed the door . Flora regarded Jason with fear and hatred . Then she said , " Well , go ahead . Ask me . Ask me anything , you . . . you . . . " And she called him an epithet Jason had heard only twice before , from rough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for young Mrs. Bristol . He wondered where Mr. Ziegfeld had recruited her , or perhaps it had been one of his agents . " Has your husband ever met your . . . brother ? " The pause was deliberate . " Yes ! We went to a play a year ago in Boston . Why ? " " And Mr. Bristol knew he was your . . . brother ? " " I . . . I . . . Of course he did . " " And met him ? " " Goddammit , yes ! How many times  --  ? " " Did he know him by the name of Carstairs ? " Flora rolled up her eyes , beseeching the ceiling . " Hell , yes . " " Is that his real or stage name ? " A long hesitation . " Well , if you want to know , it 's his stage name . Everybody knows him by that name . " Jason let a moment or two elapse . Flora looked at him imploringly , and genuine tears began to roll down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if praying . " Mr. Garrity , please do n't tell my husband Theo was here ! For God 's sake ! Please , please . " " But he 'll have to know , wo n't he , when he finds out about the jewelry ? He 'll have to report it to the police first of all , then to thep338insurance company . Quite a mess . Your husband does n't look like a meek man . He might look for your . . . brother . " She licked her lips . Jason was disbelieving . Had n't she given the slightest thought to this at all ? The girl was an idiot . Little Nicole was a genius in comparison . Nicole would have thought of all the consequences and made clever plans . " And the police will question your . . . brother too . Probably with your husband present . " Her whole face had shrunk as she began to realize all the ramifications . Jason let her think  --  if it was possible for her to think . Then he said almost gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to save the reputation of the hotel , too . And save your husband embarrassment . He is n't the sort of man who 'd stand for stories in the newspapers , is he ? I need your help , Flora . And you need mine . So let 's help each other , and no more lies . What do you say ? " She nodded , and gulped . He said , " Carstairs is n't your brother , is he ? " She started to-nod again , then stopped . Then she whispered , " No . He 's a . . . chorus boy . I 've known him four years . We . . . we were always good friends , the best . We wanted to get married , but there was n't no money , and Jimmy , he wants money , and so do I. His name ai n't really Theo . . . " " I did n't think it was . Do you want to tell me his real name ? " She moaned . She put her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What good would it do ? I . . . I love him , Mr. Garrity . We 've alwaysloved each other . " Jason reflected . Then he leaned to the bed and took one of her hands , and she clung to his fingers helplessly , like a child . " Is Theo in trouble , Flora ? " She dropped her head , and her hair hid her face . She was crying silently . Then in a broken voice she whimpered , " He 's in trouble , yes . Gambling . When his play closed  --  two months ago , it was n't any good , and he only got twenty-five dollars a week in the chorus , anyway  --  he did n't have a cent . I sent him some money . Mr. Bristol , he 's kind of cheap , Mr. Garrity . Does n't give me much to spend . All charge accounts . I . . . I bought some things and charged them , and then I sold them . I told Mr. Bristol maybe someone took the clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he could n't prove she 'd taken them , so he couldn'tp339have her arrested , though he wanted to . And Theo  --  he gambled away what I gave him , hoping he could have some luck and pay it all off . He lost . And now they 're after him . " " Who ? " She shrank . " Gamblers . He owes them . " " The Black Hand ? " She nodded . Then she tossed back her damp hair and looked at Jason with anguish . " They 'll kill him , Mr. Garrity ! You know what they are ! He owes a lot of money . . . " " And he came to you and asked you to help him . " " Yes ! And I only had two hundred dollars , and he owes thousands ! He 's scared to death . " Jason thought . " How do you know he 's told you the truth ? " " I know he did . This is n't the first time . He 's always gambled . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep the rest of the money and get into some little business . " I wonder , thought Jason . Well , it was none of his affair . He had the hotel to protect . Still , his compassion for this beautiful imbecilewas strong . " Do n't you think it 's time to stop helping Theo ? For your own sake ? Do n't you think you should n't see him any-more ? " " I suppose so , " she murmured . " I sure got a scare this time . But I love him , Mr. Garrity ! What shall I do ? " " You can do only one of two things . Never see Theo again . Perhaps when he knows he ca n't come to you again , he will reform . That 's the best you can do for him . Or you can leave your husband right now , today , and join Theo . What good would that do either of you ? You have only two hundred dollars . . . " She was shaking her head over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Elise  --  to tell all those lies . " " I thought it was something like that . " Jason 's voice shook with rage . " Where did you find that woman ? " " She answered an ad is , I liked her , and the others were awful . I gave her the reference , a false name . That is , I had a friend of mine give it . She 'd married a man like Mr. Bristol , too . She never saw Elise . I just asked her . " Jason marveled at this naivete . " Do you know if she was ever in trouble ? "  | " No . " The blue eyes looked at him with fresh fear . " I did n't ask . I just liked her . You should have seen the others ! " " Did she ever steal anything from you ? " " No . Never . I 'm real good to her , Mr. Garrity . Even if she did n't have any references . Said she 'd just come over from France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , again marveling . The girl was incredibly stupid . When she lost her stupendous beauty , Bristol would surely divorce her . Jason hoped she would be shrewd enough to find a good lawyer and get a sound settlement , unless she again embroiled herself with one such as " Theo " and was discovered . Then it would be the streets . She would be too old for the Mrs. Lindons . Women , he thought suddenly , are n't the most fortunate creaturesin the world , and we men have pretty much exploited them . And without pity . We want either our illusion of them , or their money . I wonder how often we really want the woman herself . Sometimes , perhaps , but not very often , dammit . It 's the rare man who 'll get himself in. a mess like this one for a woman , but it 's quite common for a woman to do it for the man she loves . He said , almost gently , " Mrs. Bristol , I am going to give you some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Who was Mr. Bristol 's second wife ? And his first one ? " She stared at him openmouthed , wondering . " Well , his first wife  --  she had a lot of money , and he did n't . He did n't tell me . I just heard . She had two children , girls , and then she died , and she left him all her money . Then he married somebody like me  --  I heard . A chorus girl . I do n't know her name . She had a friend . . . " The blue eyes opened enormously , with shock and realization . " And . . . and . . . Mr. Bristol found out . He threw her out . Not a cent , either . Just the clothes on her back , and then he divorced her . And then . . . and then . . . three years ago he married me . Oh , my God . " Her voice fell to a whisper . " Yes , " said Jason . " And anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . Thirty . " " Yes , " said Jason . She was silent . He let his comments sink in . Then he said , " If Mr. Bristol . . . if you and he should part , it would be a goodp341idea to have a smart lawyer , Flora . And keep your skirts clean in the meantime . " " Yes , yes ! " she said passionately . " Well , now , what are you going to tell your husband about the jewelry ? " She came back to the present with a start . " I 'll . . . I 'll tell him I put it down . . . somewhere and could n't find it again . In New York . We go to a lot of places . He 'll be mad , but it 'll be better than what I thought up , wo n't it ? " Jason smiled . " And you 're still very pretty , Flora . And young . " " I know what you mean . " She actually smiled , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do about Elise , Flora ? " " What ? I gave her two hundred dollars  --  she knew about Theo . " " That was n't very bright of you to let her know . " " She did n't know  --  all the other times . Theo and I meet in New York , in his rooms . This is the very first time I let him come to my place  --  he just had to have money ! He could n't wait . " " Did you ever hear of blackmail ? " She turned a ghastly white , and her eyes seemed to fill her face . " You mean . . . ? " " Yes . Elise could strip you , threaten to tell your husband about Theo being here , and the jewelry , and the bribe you gave her . " " Oh , Jesus , Jesus ! What am I going to do ? " She wrung her hands . " Will you let me take care of her , and not say one single word ? " She was shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then ring the bell for her . " Elise came in , moving as silently as a shadow , and closed the door . She looked quickly from her mistress to Jason , then back to Flora . Jason said , " I have only a few words for you , Elise . " " What ? " Her tone was impertinent . " When you came to work for Mrs. Bristol , you had no references . She falsified one for you , because she liked you . You must have worked somewhere before . How old are you ? About thirtyfive , forty ? Where did you work before ? " " None of your business . " He leaned toward her , implacable . " A crime has been committedhere , and not the crime about the jewelry . I am going to havep342your background investigated , Elise . I am going to find out all about you  --  whether or not you have ever been in trouble , for in-stance . " She turned an ugly scarlet . " I never was in trouble ! I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , as if he approved . " Good . But we 'll find out , anyway . We 'll find out where you and your father lived ; all about you . Your old friends . Your reputation . Everything . Then , when it is all . . . clear , you and Mrs. Bristol will get along together very well . " The woman leaned toward him like a vicious cat , snarling . " Is that so , sir ? Well , no , thank you . I 'm quitting , and right now ! " She turned to Flora . " And it 's all your doing , you little bitch ! I 'll fix you ! " Jason stood up and seized the woman 's black-clad arm and swung her around to face him . " No , you wo n't . You 've already blackmailed Mrs. Bristol . That 's a very serious crime . Have you blackmailed others , too ? We 'll find out . You see , Mrs. Bristol has told me everything . She is going to tell her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Flora looked at him with horror . Then she saw him wink . " Yes , " she muttered . " Right away . " " And he 'll throw you out on the street ! " " For what , Elise ? " Jason asked . " Because Mrs. Bristol had a friend visit her ? You saw nothing ; you heard nothing . You were n't here . " " I know she gave him her jewelry ! " Oh , hell , thought Jason , did the little fool actually tell her ? But Flora said , " How do you know ? I never told you ; you only know the jewelry is gone . I . . . I just gave you that money so you would n't make a fuss about it and get Mr. Bristol madder than he 's going to be . I do n't know why I gave you that money in the first place ! Maybe just to keep you from going to the police , as Mr. Garrity wanted me to . You never saw a thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked away , thought Jason with relief . He said , " If you ever bother Mrs. Bristol , or try to cause her trouble , she will have you arrested . That money you received from Mrs. Bristol was in lieu of notice . Now , leave this hotel at once , or you 'll find yourself in prison . Judgesp343do n't like blackmailers , and if you try anything anonymously , we 'll still find you . I promise we will . " The woman screamed , " Is that so ! If everything was just dandy , why 'd she give me that money ? " Jason pretended impatience . " Because , somehow , the jewelry has disappeared . Carelessness , perhaps . And Mrs. Bristol did n't want the police called . " " I saw that man in these rooms ! " " What if you did ? " " And he slept here ! " " In Mr. Bristol 's room . He 's an old friend . " Then Jason added , " In the meantime , your background is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . So get out , now . " The woman spat at Flora and at Jason . Then she ran from the room , muttering threats under her breath . Flora flung herself on her pillows , crying with exhaustion and release from terror . Jason watched her cry for a few minutes . When she sat up , he said , " There may be some mention  --  you ca n't tell  --  of Theo being here , anyway . You took him to the dining room , did n't you ? Of course . You 'd better make up a good story to tell your husband . " She rubbed her eyes with her knuckles and frowned in concentration . Then she brightened . " I know ! I 'll tell him the actor husbandof a friend stopped in to give me some messages from . . . let me see . . . Clara ! He was on his way to join her in . . . where ? Pittsburgh . Rehearsing , both of them , for a play . James does n't like stage people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've talked about Clara to him ; he never met her , though . I 'll write to Clara  --  " " Oh , no you wo n't ! You 'll just be getting yourself into more complications and lies . Do n't write . Just tell him that simple story , then change the subject . As fast as you can , as if it is n't important . And pray hard . " She nodded solemnly . " I ca n't tell you how grateful I am for what you 've done , Mr. Garrity . " His voice became cold . " I did it for the reputation of the hotel , and to save two innocent people from your accusations . Two innocentpeople , Mrs. Bristol . I bet you never gave a thought to the possibility that they might have gone to prison . "
