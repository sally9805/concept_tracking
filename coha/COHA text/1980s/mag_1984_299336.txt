THE EXPERTS SPEAK <P> by Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky ; Pantheon ; 352 pages ; $19.95 <P> This book is irreverent , unfair and subversive . What more could anyone ask for ? It begins with the 16th century geological musings of Martin Luther : " Longer ago than 6,000 years the world did not exist . " It hurtles downhill from there toward outright insolence . Did Abraham Lincoln really say in 1859 , " Negro equality ! Fudge ! How long . . . shall there continue knaves to vend , and fools to quip , so low a piece of demagogism as this " ? Did the U.S. Labor Department truly announce that 1930 would be " a splendid employment year " ? <P> You can look it up . For those who still accept without question the hokum that too often issues from the mouths of eminent personages , Christopher Cerf , co-conspirator in such truly dangerous works of spoofery as Not the New York Times ( 1978 ) , together with Victor Navasky , editor of that sobersided weekly , The Nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplaced certitude . " We can say with some confidence , " they say with supreme confidence , " that the experts are wrong without regard to race , creed , color , sex , discipline , specialty , country , culture or century . " <P> The evidence is impressive . " Everything that can be invented has been invented , " said the head of the U.S. Patent Office in 1899 . Declared Wilbur Wright in 1901 : " Man will not fly for 50 years . " Thomas Edison , circa 1880 : " The phonograph . . . is not of any commercial value . " Albert Einstein , 1932 : " There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable . " Richard Wooley , then Britain 's Astronomer Royal , 1956 : " Space travel is utter bilge . " <P> One may quibble with the editors ' rather broad definition of an expert . Richard Nixon is included ( " When the President does it , that means it is not illegal , " 1977 ) . Also Jimmy Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran is an island of stability in the Middle East , " 1977 ) . Also Ronald Reagan , often . But so are laboratories full of more justly certified savants like Lord Kelvin , the respected British physicist ( " X rays are a hoax , " circa 1900 ) , and Dr. Linard Williams , medical officer to the Insurance Institute of London , who said in 1932 : " If your eyes are set wide apart you should be a vegetarian , because you inherit the digestive characteristics of bovine or equine ancestry . " <P> After digesting a few dozen such nuggets of certified knowledge , one may feel a tendency to distrust experts of all sorts , and experience a nagging itch to start questioning authority . A reader may even suspect that his opinion is worth just as much as that of any horn-rimmed oracle in the land . Beware . Lest a layman become so emboldened that he or she starts holding forth at cocktail parties without having done the homework , Cerf and Navasky offer the last words of John B. Sedgwick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1864 : " They could n't hit an elephant at this dist- " - By Donald Morrison
