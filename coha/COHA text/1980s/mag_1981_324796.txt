The released Soviet sub heads for port and hard questions <P> The antiquated gray submarine was towed part of the way down the channel it had navigated on its own ten days before . Finally it cast off . Then , joining the flotilla of naval vessels hovering anxiously beyond the twelve-nautical-mi. limit , Soviet " Whiskey " - class submarine No. 137 headed for its home base at Baltiysk , near the port of Kaliningrad . So ended , peacefully enough , the diplomatic uproar that began when Sweden discovered the sub on a reef in a restricted military zone only nine miles from Karlskrona , an ultrasensitive naval base on the Baltic Sea . The incursion of the sub , said Prime Minister Thorbjorn Falldin last week , was " the most flagrant violation of Swedish territory since World War II . " Then Falldin added , " The violation was bad enough , but worse is the fact that the submarine most likely carried nuclear warheads on its torpedoes , according to our investigations . " <P> Initially , the Swedes had vowed to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why its skipper had come to grief only ten yds. from shore , like a careless Sunday yachtsman caught by an ebbing tide . The Swedes scoffed at the Soviets ' reported claim that the sub 's navigation gear had failed : after all , it had certainly been working well enough to guide the vessel up the channel in the first place . Declared General Lennart Ljung , the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces : " I do n't think it happened because the gyrocompass broke down . They have many other ways of navigating . " <P> But the Soviets apologized and agreed to pay some $658,000 for the salvage operations and , after some sharp diplomatic words , the Swedes agreed to let the sub go . The episode embarrassed not only the Soviets ; the Swedes did not explain how a submarine of 1950s vintage had managed to penetrate its waters undetected until a passing fisherman in a dory looked over and there she was , atop the rocks . <P> <P> The events leading to the release of the sub were a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander Pyotr Gushin refused to leave his stranded vessel to talk to the Swedes . Not until Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko allowed Gushin to cooperate did the commander relent . The skipper and his navigation officer emerged , asked for and were allowed permission to shower , and then settled down to claim during a seven-hour interrogation that they had hit the reef because their compass had failed . <P> Only an hour after Gushin had left the sub , the harsh Baltic elements took an unexpected hand in the plot . Gale winds of up to 85 m.p.h. slammed towering combers against the sides of the sub , cascading tons of water on deck . The 50-man Soviet crew quickly decided it could stand no more . Red flares signaling distress whooshed up from the conning tower , and the radio put out the call " Mayday , Mayday . " Under the sea 's battering , the submarine developed a 17 list to starboard . The vessel 's large electrical storage batteries threatened to leak acid that could fill the hull with poisonous chlorine gas . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
