After Mandate bowls over Illinois , Hart needs a win in New York <P> In The Godfather , it was the severed head of a horse placed at the foot of the bed . In Treasure Island , it was a black spot pressed in the palm of the hand . In the 1984 Democratic primary campaign , the ultimate jinx has been the title front runner , bestowed by the evening news . <P> So when CBS Anchorman Dan Rather cheerfully said to Walter Mondale , after the former Vice President had defeated Gary Hart by 41% to 35% in the Illinois primary last week , " Congratulations . I suppose now you 're the front runner again , " Mondale recoiled in horror . " No , no , " he spluttered . " The debate has just begun ... We 've got a long fight to go ahead of us here . " <P> Whether he likes it or not , Mondale is once again the candidate to beat . Unlike previous favorites who fell apart after New Hampshire upsets , Mondale has struggled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Labor rallied , the blue-collar workers and old folks turned out , the regular Democrats followed the endorsements of party leaders . Mondale even reached into the Chicago suburbs to win a large share of Hart 's Yumpie ( young upwardly mobile professional ) vote . It went pretty much according to the pundits ' script-at least as it was written before New Hampshire , when the Mondale campaign was still a " juggernaut " and Hart a " dark horse . " <P> But Mondale 's caution is justified . He can not really hope to re-emerge as the clear favorite to take the nomination unless he wins the New York primary next week . In many ways New York poses the purest test to date . Mondale is no longer burdened by his aura of inevitability , and Hart is no longer a novelty item . Voters should be less swayed by ephemera . <P> With a total of 285 delegates ( 172 to be chosen next week ) , the Empire State is the biggest prize yet , and the second biggest ( after California ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have split the primaries , Mondale has fared far better in the caucuses , winning almost twice as many delegates . A victory in New York would not only widen that gap , but would show that Mondale can pull in the popular vote . Says a top official of the Democratic National Committee : " If Hart loses New York , he has to win virtually everything else the rest of the way . Mondale is trying for the K.O. , and he may score one . " Concedes a Hart aide : " You can explain away Illinois and Michigan , but if the message ca n't be sold in New York , it probably wo n't sell overall . " <P> As a hunting ground for Mondale , New York is like Illinois , only more so . " It is more Democratic-with a big D-more ethnic , more elderly , more unionized than Illinois , " says Tim Russert , counselor to New York Governor Mario Cuomo . Says a Mondale campaign official : " New Yorkers are tougher , more cynical and not as taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out there a while . " New York City Mayor Ed Koch backs Mondale , as do Cuomo and 55 of 62 county chairmen . Unlike Illinois , New York does not allow independents and Republicans to vote in the Democratic primary , thus stripping Hart of his ability to reach outside the party . Says Hart 's national cochairman , Theodore Sorensen : " It 's tough . The entire Establishment is against us. "
