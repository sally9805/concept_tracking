txt EVENTUALLY SOMEONE Is going to get killed in the place . It is such a shambles , Such a hazard . Disaster is wailing to befall any soul who dares to venture inside , And it Is not hard to get into it , for the owner never boarded It up , or fenced it off . or fixed It up . The owner left it to disintegrate . He does n't seem to care If anyone gels hurt on ids rundown properly . He pretends It is n't there . For he does n't have to look at it . But there it Is ? yawning wide , its windows unlashed , Its doors caved in , its walls falling down , a mysterious and ghostly derelict that lures the youths of the village . It is a 12-story slum , built ' of reinforced concrete , that stretches for half a block and lords grimly over the south , suburb of Riverdale . And It is so dangerous , says local Police Chief Pete Sanders , " that some . one , sometime is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't happened yet . " " There " is an empty fortress that Iles In ruin in the suburb 's midst  --  level after level ' full of holes in the floor through which a body could fall six or seven stories . There are twisted metal staircases that stop in midair , leading an unsuspecting victim to a fatal drop . THERE ARE ourstm : walls missing , broken winds , drooping beams , and mysterious chutes that , If someone tripped and fell inside , would whip him down to a water-filled basement 80 feet below . It is a place where someone  --  especially one of the teen-age kids who love to explore it ? could get trapped and die and nobody would ever hear his cries for help . " There " is an abandoned grain elevator . It was once a bustling place of business , 16 years ago . It once employed half of the village of Riverdale . But since 1064 , it has lain empty . For the last 10 years , the Village of Riverdale has been trying to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire Department made an inspection of it and " found enough violations to fill up 20 pages , " says Fire Inspector Dennis Malloy. ? " rhat 's when we tried to gel rid of the place . It was simply too dangerous . " The place was going downhill fast . Scrappers had robbed from it , vandals had broken it up , there were tires in it , holes in it . It was falling apart . The place was in total disrepair . The building has no redeeming qualities to It , and it has every kind of hazard possible . But the problem is we took it to court and we have n't gottun rid of It yet . " " I 'M NOT TALKING ' about days , " says Police Chief Solders . " I 'm not talking about weeks or months or even a year . We 've been trying to get rid of this grain elevator for years and years . The only answer Is to tear it down before someone gets killed in there . " " Because of the sheer size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Malloy . " The cost is too great . It would cost $400,000 to demolish it ? to blow it up and cart away . And blowing it up is the only way to take it down , This village does n't have that kind of money . It ca n't afford to tear it down . " You know , in Chicago , when there is substandard housing and the landlord wo n't do anything about it , the city eventually tears It down at its own expense and then gets HUD money to help pay for it . But that 's for substandard housing , There 's no HUD money available for tearing down substandard grain elevators . " It 's not just that the grain elevator occupies property that could otherwise he used constructively to help Riverdale develop . It 's not just that the building is Iry eyesore . It is that the village fathers , and the police department , and the fire depart. , meat have received hundreds of COM ) 1aints from residents over the years , And they are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at light  --  either to drink , or to be adventuram , or on a dare  --  one of them wentually will die In there . RIVERDALE 'S HANDS are tied , not only because the village ca n't afford tr tear the place down , but also , becaust they do n't own the property . When the Hales &; Hunter Feed Co. closed the business down . they sok the empty grain elevator to Mickow Warenotises , Inc. , of Hammond , Ind When the Village of Riverdale went of . ter Mickow to try to get them to repair the structure or tear It down , it was unsuccessful . Initially , the village got the judge to fine Mickow , Inc. , first 150 a day for not fixing it ' or tearing it down , and then $100 a day . But that ruling was reversed two years later . None of the fines was ever paid . And since then , Mickow has claimed in court that they no longer own the building . The building was sold , according to Mickow to one Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers of Riverdale . Especially since the property has been assessed at 5319,385 . It seemed strange to Fire Inspector Malloy . The new owner , Norman Fuller , supposedly , lives on Rural Route 2 in Fords-vine , Ky . Well , Dennis Malloy went to Fordsville himself . He talked to the postmistress there , Buda Patton , who said she knew just about everyone in Ford.sville and had never heard of Norman Fuller , There are 60 mall boxes on the Rural Route 2 mail route , she said , there is no Norman Fuller . MALLOY WENT to the county seat and found that no Norman Fuller had ever paid taxes there or voted or bought property . As far as anyone down hi Fordsville knew , there was no Norman Fuller . Nobody ever had heard of him . The case of the abandoned grain etc valor is back hi Cook County Circuit Court . Norman Fuller has never shown up before the judge . Nobody can say who he is or where he is ? not even the Mickow warehouse company , which says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $505 . The people of Riverdale and the police chief and the fire department really do n't care anymore who owns the building that is rusting out and disintegrating in their midst . They just want to get rid of it . Although fires are set in it . the Fire Department wo n't send firemen in anymore to put them out . The firemen could get killed falling through the floors . Although teen-agers love to carouse inside , and could get hurt , the police department does not want to go in and chase them  --  for flight could send one of them flying down an eight-story grain shaft . So the Village ot Riverdale is waiting for the slow wheels of justice to determine what to do with this junk heap . So far it has taken over five years . and they are gelling impatient . Because before 11 decision is made in court , someune 's kid out on a lark could get killed . As Pete Sanders says . " Ini afraid it 'll occur if this thing does n't curve down . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rophe wailing M happen . "
