DETROIT  --  The Big Three auto makers may report an all-time quarterly earnings record  --  or close to it  --  despite the recent slowdown in sales . But this seeming contradiction may be resolved by lower profits later in the year . Analysts estimate the companies will soon report that first-quarter earnings increased as much as 21% from the year-ago period . If so , their cumulative earnings could hit $3. 5 billion , eclipsing the previous record of $3. 49 billion set in last year ' s second quarter . Even the most pessimistic forecast puts their combined earnings at $3. 04 billion in the latest quarter , handily above the $2. 89 billion in last year ' s first quarter . The projected earnings gains stem from the companies ' 7. 3% increase in vehicle production during the quarter as compared with a year ago . But their sales in the latest quarter fell 11% from a year earlier . That means the auto makers now are saddled with inventories far higher than last year , and thus almost certainly can ' t sustain their recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter was the high-water mark for earnings for a while , " says one Big Three financial analyst . " Is there going to be a payback in the second or third quarter , because you don ' t sustain production and earnings increases like this when sales are weak ? " To boost sales  --  and thus prevent costly production cuts  --  the Big Three recently announced a new round of more-generous buyer incentives . These incentives began too late to affect first-quarter earnings , although they could hurt earnings in the current period . Several analysts last week lowered their 1989 earnings estimates and downgraded their investment ratings on the Big Three stocks . Analysts believe that General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. will post higher first-quarter earnings . Most expect Ford Motor Co. ' s earnings to be lower or , at best , flat with last year  --  although Ford has surprised analysts with higher-than-expected earnings in the recent past . If the analysts ' consensus is correct , Ford will post its first quarterly decline in earnings since the first quarter of 1986 . GM will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month and Chrysler will report in the first week of May . Analysts expect GM to post between $1. 29 billion , or $1. 90 a share , and $1. 53 billion , or $2. 25 a share after a 2-for-1 stock split . Even the lower forecast would surpass the $1. 09 billion , or $1. 56 a share on a post-split basis , the No. 1 auto maker earned a year earlier . But the 1988 result was boosted by an accounting change that added $224. 2 million , or 35 cents a share , to net income . The change allowed GM to defer certain manufacturing expenses until a vehicle is sold instead of when it is made . Without that one-time gain , GM ' s earnings could increase as much as about 75% from a year earlier . The big reason is that in the first quarter , GM produced about 12% more cars and trucks in North America than it did a year earlier . But the company ' s U.S. sales have declined more than 13% so far this year , because its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall market is weaker . So the rate of increase in production , and thus in earnings , will be virtually impossible to sustain . Ford , meanwhile , is expected to report earnings were between $1. 44 billion and $1. 6 billion  --  below the record-setting $1. 62 billion it earned in the year-before quarter . The possible decline in the latest quarter " means they ' ve bumped up against capacity , " says David Healy , an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York . " Sales are flattening out . They no longer have big improvements in volume to lift their earnings and there ' s a bit of a squeeze on profit margins . " Analysts estimate that Chrysler might have doubled its year-earlier earnings . Net income in the latest quarter could reach $370. 7 million , or $1. 60 a share , compared with $183. 7 million , or 83 cents a share , the year before . But the 1988 figure was depressed by a one-time charge for plant closings that reduced earnings 42 cents a share . Thus , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , or $1. 25 a share . The sluggish pace of auto sales has prompted several analysts to cut their 1989 earnings forecasts for the Big Three . Ronald A. Glantz , an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco , recently reduced his full-year earnings estimate for GM by 50 cents a share , to $6. 50 a share . He also dropped his estimates for both Ford and Chrysler by 40 cents a share  --  to $9. 90 for Ford and $4. 90 for Chrysler . Ann Knight of PaineWebber Inc. in New York made similar reductions . Drexel ' s Mr. Healy slashed his 1989 earnings estimate for Ford to $9. 25 a share from $10. 65 a share . However , he raised his estimate for GM to $5. 75 a share from $5. 50 , and left his estimate for Chrysler unchanged at $5 a share.  --  - Table Share Earnings FIRST QUARTER Estimated 1989 1988 GM* $1. 90-2. 25 $1. 56 Ford 3. 00-3. 30 3. 31 Chrysler 1. 35-1. 60 0. 83 *After two-for-one stock split <> Credit : Staff Reporter of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
