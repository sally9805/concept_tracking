A Texan comes to Newsweek <P> When the senior editors of Newsweek assembled for a meeting last Wednesday morning , foreboding filled the room . For several weeks rumors had circulated that Editor Lester Bernstein would be replaced by someone outside the Newsweek fold . Bernstein strode into the room and began complaining good-naturedly about the sluggish air conditioner . Then he quipped : " Oh , my God , do I sound like Nixon before the speech , talking to the technicians ? " When the nervous laughter subsided , Bernstein confirmed what much of the staff had suspected . He had been dismissed as editor and , effective Sept. 7 , would be replaced by William D. Broyles Jr. , 37 , editor in chief of Texas Monthly and California magazine . Broyles will be the fifth top editor at Newsweek in ten years . <P> Bernstein , 61 , became editor in 1979 . <P> Gracious and well liked , he had a reputation for running the magazine with a cool and steady hand . His tenure was marked by a number of notable achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Vietnam Did to Us . " But from the outset his appointment was thought to be transitional , and before long , staffers were complaining about excessive editorial reserve . " He was fine on the routine , " says one former Newsweek editor . " For anything bigger , he had to be coaxed along . " <P> From this perspective , a trio of Newsweek cover stories in the past three months seemed to be setting out in a different direction . An April article on poverty in the U.S. , with a controversial combination of cover billings ( " Reagan 's America " ; " And the Poor Get Poorer " ) , was castigated in Newsweek 's own pages by Columnist Milton Friedman for giving a " most misleading impression . " The following week 's cover billed the " final days " of Leonid Brezhnev , and based the story on an unconfirmed report of a stroke supposedly suffered by the Soviet President . Said an upset Newsweek staffer recently : " The guy 's still alive and planning to go to summit meetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 7 cover called attention to a significant school of contemporary painting , realism . But the illustration , by distinguished Artist William Bailey , was a portrait of a half-naked woman , a cover selection that raised eyebrows and criticism . <P> Though the recent covers had nothing to do with the change of editors , they were evidence of editorial ferment . Said Katharine Graham , chairman of the parent Washington Post Co. : " I was not displeased with any of those covers . " Indeed , Graham 's decision to fire Bernstein was more likely motivated by the bottom line , not cover lines . Newsweek ( domestic circulation 2.95 million , compared with TIME 'S 4.4 million ) has been losing advertising pages and advertising revenue ( the latter is down 6% for the first four months of this year ; TIME 'S is up 2% ) . News-Editor Bernstein week 's U.S. newsstand sales have also been dropping , compared with TIME'S.
