txt WASHINGTON ? " When I breathed the gas I became very sick , " the slightly built Laotian refugee said . " Within one hour or two I had diarrhea , headache , my stomach lumped un and down . " It felt like heavy pressure on my whole body , my vision was blurred , and my eyes felt like popping out . I swallowed ginger and opium and felt better in several days . " That 's the way Tou Yi Vang described for congressmen a chemical assault , on his Laotian village that killed eight of his fellow Hmong hill tribesmen . " THEY HAD HEAVY bleeding from the nose , they could not stop their bodies News analysis from shaking , and died in several hours , " he said . Path last week Vang 's story was only one of thousands of such tales of agony . Over the last five years thousands of refugees from Laos , Cambodia ( Kam . puchea ) , and Afghanistan have told horror stories of chemical warfare attacks . Putting together the accounts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autopsies on suspected victims and tests of chemicals gathered at attack sites failed to disclose the presence of any of the chemical agents used in previous wars . Now the United States government says , it has found in Cambodia the pres- ence of a toxin common In wheat and other grains , but never before used in war . The discovery , however , has raised as many questions as it has answered . THERE IS , FIRST of all , the question of possible Soviet Involvement . If the Soviets are the source , as U.S. officials have implied , It will make future arms-control agreements far more difficult . Past arms talks have stalled on the question of verifiability , which will take on new meaning if it can be proved the Soviets are using toxins In violation of existing agreements on chemical and biological warfare . Proof of Soviet involvement would also be a potent propaganda tool in the Third World , against whom the attacks have taken place , and in Europe , which is trying to decide whether President Reagan 's militarism is a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up , it also %Yin mean that a new chemical genie is out of the bottle , one that could become available to small , threatened countries far more caisly than nuclear arms . Given all this importance , two more questions arise : Why did it take so long to find the answer , and why go public when only one sample has been tested ? if the sample had come from Afghanistan , Soviet involvement might have been proven , as ? the Soviets are fighting there directly instead of through surrogates , as in Laos and Cambodia . Why not wait for that sort of proof ? AS IT HAFTENED , Secretary of State Alexander Haig was reined in by the , White House when he tried to tie the mycotoxins directly to the Soviet Union . In Berlin , where he first talked about the discovery , the White House ordered a change in his speech deleting a direct reference to Moscow . It came out instead like this , " At the very time when the U.S. is being accused of delay on arms control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms agreements ? that prohibiting the use of toxins , " The Soviets deny any involvement , as do their Vietnamese and Cambodian allies . U.S. officials say that if they had waited for positive proof many hundreds might have died from toxin attacks . They say the publicity may deter future strikes . In addition , they say collection of samples is difficult and can be unscientific . Sometimes refugees bring out , clothes bearing chemical traces . SOMETIMES THE U.S. has dispatched Intelligence teams to collect samples . This apparently was the case in Cambodia , where the one sample tested was found . // Tou Yi Vang with Rep. Jim Leach R. , la. at a congressional hearing on the use of chemical weapons . U.S. government scientists soy it took so long to discover the mycotoxins because they were looking for chemicals previously used In this sort of warfare . Only recently did a Midwest researcher discover a way to detect mycotoxins . The U.S. asked this researcher to look at three samples , one with nothing , one impregnated with mycotoxin , and the third from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project . The Cambodian sample revealed high levels of three sorts of mycotoxins of the trichothecene group . Studies of the effects of chemical warfare in Indochina and Afghanistan by Journalists and others had suggested mycotoxins might be the cause . BUT SOME SAY the U.S. tried to ignore the evidence for many years . The Reagan administration has been credited with pressing for answers . " The refusal of our government to acknowledge evidence that 20,000 to 30,000 human beings have been killed in recent years with chemical weapons has been analogous to the silence the Western world exhibited toward Nazi gassing during World War II , " said Rep. Jim Leach ( R. , la. ) , a crusader on the chemical warfare issue . Leach , who brought Tou Yi yang , the Hmong tribesman , before Congress in December , 1919 , said he now ( eels vindicated for his years of attention to this issue . Leach warns that chemical weapons , if not quickly controlled , could become " the poor man 's weapon of mass destruction . " " If the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impunity , the list of other countries willing and able to do likewise will al . most certainly grow , " he said .
