Of course the novel is in a mess ; it always has been in a mess . Accordingly , articles about the state of the novel or the death of the novel are generally boring and are best left to the critics . It must be said , however , that the present mess is singular . I have no wish to suggest a remedy , or to mount an attack on contemporary novelists ? nothing so grand as that ? but only to make a few remarks about the connections between , of all things , medicine and literature . By the novel , I am speaking of serious fiction . By serious fiction ( which of course includes the comic ) , I am not speaking of entertainments cranked out as commodities for the marketplace , some very skillfully but all as standardized as soap operas . By the serious novel , long or short , I am speaking of the words set down by one person that create an original fictive world , which in turn is recognized by a reader and read with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one particular aspect of the current mess because , even with all the perennial crises , deaths , and resurrections of the novel , this one is surely something new and passing strange . It could only have come about through some loony misunderstanding by otherwise sensible persons , that is to say , novelists of repute , acclaimed by critics and rewarded by foundations . The misunderstanding is of this order . Given that life in the modern world is deranged , it does not follow that the novelist should in the exercise of his vocation write deranged novels . This is like saying that the only way a psychiatrist can talk about crazy people is to talk crazy . Do n't misunderstand me . I intend no plea for a return to the " traditional novel " with its standard apparatus studied in Literature 101 : characterization , plot , description , setting , narrative , and so on . No , if the practitioners of the nouveau ' roman want to do away with the traditional baggage of the novel , it is all right with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a park bench . Describe the geometry of the park paths and the contour of the shrubbery for ten pages . Say nothing about the man or the woman except that perhaps he decides to touch her on the thigh . Perhaps he does . Perhaps he does not . Perhaps it is only the woman who mistakenly imagines that he has done so . There is something to be said for such a novel . But what is more curious and worthy of note ? not because it is loony but ism , or deconstruction , I 'd prefer to mention a nineteenth-century Russian doctor named Chekhov . One reason for doing so is a fellow feeling and certain superficial resemblances between us . He was a physician and a writer of fiction . I was a physician and am a writer of fiction . We both had pulmonary tuberculosis . Chekhov , like me , was not keen on doctoring and was glad of an excuse to get away from it . There the resemblances seem to stop . Chekhov never wrote a novel . I never wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to But as I thought about it and began to read further in Chekhov , it occurred to me that there were other concerns which I shared with him , concerns which it seems appropriate to speak of now because they are of even greater moment to us than they were in the nineteenth century . Again I find myself coming back to his medical training . And I hope it wo n't sound presumptuous to say that Chekhov 's great genius brought a certain set of mind from medicine to literature that served well in his case and that in my case has been indispensable . I refer to the diagnostic stance that comes so naturally to the physician ? diagnostic at the outset and in the end , one hopes , therapeutic . Part of the natural equipment of the doctor is a nose for pathology . Something is wrong . What is it ? What is the nature of the illness ? Where is the lesion ? Is it acute or chronic , treatable or fatal ? Can we understand it ? Does the disease have a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall use as my point of departure not the conventional view of Chekhov as a masterful portrayer of life as it is , without judgment or ideology . I think , rather , of a less well known Chekhov , Chekhov the literary clinician , the pathologist of the strange spiritual malady of the modern age . What interests me is the extraordinary apposition in Chekhov of a scrupulous respect for life in the concrete , a distaste for ideology , a refusal to bend fact to thesis , all this , on the one hand , and , on the other , his diagnostic approach to the ills of the modern world ? an approach which , after all , entails a certain degree of abstraction and generalizing and sciencing . I would propose that now , almost a hundred years later , this literary-diagnostic method is even more appropriate to the fictional enterprise of the late twentieth century . In other times , the sense of the wholeness and well-being of society , or at least much of educated society , outweighed the suspicion that something had gone very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tasks of the serious novelist is , if not to isolate the bacillus under the microscope , at least to give the sickness a name , to render the unspeakable speakable . Not to overwork the comparison , the artist 's work in such times is surely not that of the pathologist , whose subject matter is a corpse and whose question is not " What is wrong ? " but " What did the patient die of ? " For I take it as going without saying that the entire enterprise of literature is , like that of a physician , undertaken in hope . Otherwise why would we , writer and reader , be here ? Why bother to read , write , teach , study , if the patient is already dead ? For in this case the patient is the culture itself . ent from the fiction of the past 200 years . Literature in earlier times might be understood as an attempt to dramatize conflicts and resolutions , to articulate and confirm values in a society where there already existed a consensus about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Given such a consensus , a corpus of meanings held in common , it was possible for a novelist or playwright or poet to create a fictive world within which the behavior of the characters could be understood , approved of , disapproved of , and the reader accordingly entertained , edified , and , in the case of great literature , his very self and his world confirmed and illumined . In short , any literature requires as the very condition of its life a certain consensus , an intersubjective community within which writers and readers can traffic in words and symbols that mean approximately the same thing for both . Now I think it fair to begin with the assumption , which seems fairly obvious , that , as the poet said , the center is not holding ; that the consensus , while it might not have disappeared , is at least seriously called into question . Indeed , to judge from a good many contemporary novels , films , and plays , it often appears that the only consensus possible is a documentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the chic property not only of the cafe existentialist , but even of Hollywood . To state the matter as plainly as possible , I would echo a writer like Guardini , who says simply that the modern world has ended , the world , that is , of the past 200 or 300 years , which we think of as having been informed by the optimism of the scientific revolution , rational humanism , and that Western cultural entity which until this century it has been more or less accurate to describe as Christendom . The Christian notion of man as a wayfarer in search of his salvation no longer informs Western culture . What most of us seem to be seeking in its place are such familiar goals as maturity , creativity , autonomy , rewarding interpersonal relations , and so forth . Most contemporary novelists have moved into a world of rootless and isolated consciousness where , as Lewis Simpson put it , " the covenant with memory and history has been abrogated in favor of the existential self . " Before considering the kind of novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or post-Christian , as it is often called I should like briefly to characterize the age itself , or one or two traits of it , from the point of view of the novelist . For like his predecessors , he seeks some remnant of a common ground from which he can see and tell , and where he hopes there will be others ; other writers , other readers , who share , if not a consensus , at least a common sense of predicament . Toward this end , it seems fair to describe the times not merely in conventional terms as a world transformed by technology both for good and for evil , the evil being the very real ugliness of much of the transformation and the very real depersonalization of many people living in such a world . What is not so self-evident is the more subtle yet more radical transformation of the very consciousness of Western man . I do n't mean the mechanization and homogenization and dehumanization one hears about so often ? though I would not quarrel with those descriptions . We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in suburbia . Yet this literature itself , let 's face it , is generally even more boring than the life it portrays . No , the real pathology lies elsewhere ? not in the station wagon or the all-electric kitchen , which are after all very good things to have , but rather in the quality of the consciousness of the novelist and his characters . But we miss the point if we say that the Western world and the life of Western man have simply been transformed by scientific technology . This is true enough , but what also has happened is that the consciousness of Western man , the layman in particular , has been transformed by a curious misapprehension of the scientific method . One is tempted to use the theological term idolatry . The misapprehension takes the form of a radical and paradoxical loss of sovereignty by the layman and a radical impoverishment of human relations ? paradoxical because it occurs in the face of man 's technological mastery of the world and his richness as a consumer of the world 's goods . In certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When something goes wrong in our technological environment , whether it is one 's car or one 's intestinal tract , we have reason to believe that " they " can fix it , " they " being the appropriate specialist . Our expectations are not unreasonable . Very few of us have the time or inclination to master carbu-retor repair or the physiology of the CI tract . But what happens when one feels in the deepest sense possible that something has gone wrong with one 's very self ? When one experiences the common complaint of the age : the loss of meaning , the purposelessness , the loss of identity , of values ? What happens when a person comes to believe that his very self is also the appropriate domain of " them , " that is , the appropriate experts of the self ? A typical case of such a surrender of sovereignty is the patient who is de-lighted when he can present his psychiatrist or analyst with a symptom or dream that fits the prevailing theory ? or when he performs well in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " I may be sick , but how happy I am when I can present my doctor with a sickness or a symptom or a dream that is recognized as a classic example of such and such a neurosis : I am an authentic neurotic ! " ut what has all this to do with the state of the novel ? Strangely enough , it is this very misapprehension of the scientific method that opens the possibility of a new and critical role for the novelist of the future . Let me oversimplify this misapprehension and state it as briefly as possible . What I am about to say is no secret to the scientist , but it is not generally known by the layman . The secret is simply this : the scientist , in practicing the scientific method , can not utter a single word about an individual thing or creature insofar as it is an individual , but only insofar as it resembles other individuals . This limitation holds true whether the individual is a molecule of NaC1 or an amoeba or a human being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all remember taking science courses in which one was confronted with a sample of sodium chloride or a specimen of a dogfish to dissect . Such studies reveal the properties shared by all sodium chloride and all dogfish . We have no particular interest in this particular pinch of salt or this particular dogfish , Again , what has this to do with the novel ? Perhaps I can state the connection best by describing my own discovery . As a person educated in science , as an admirer of the elegance and truth of the scientific method , and at the same time as a medical student undergoing psychoanalysis with the intention of going into psychiatry , it dawned on me that no science or scientist , not even Freud , could address a single word to me as an individual but only as an example of such and such a Southern neurotic type . All very well and good , you say , but so what ? But you see , there is a Catch-22 here . The catch is that each of us is , always and inescapably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck with ourselves and have somehow to live out the rest of the day being more or less ourselves . And to the degree that we allow ourselves to perceive ourselves as a type of , example of , instance of , such and such a class of Homo sapiens ? even the most creative Homo sapiens imaginable ? to this same degree do we come short of being ourselves . As to the novel , I can speak only in terms of the discovery that led me to take up novel writing , a vocation for which I was otherwise singularly unqualified . For a novelist should of course be well educated in the humanities , in literature ; and if he is a Southern novelist , I am told that he is supposed to be saturated with the Southern tradition of folklore , yarns , storytelling , family histories , and such . If you want to be another Faulkner , you have to spend a good deal of time hunkered down on courthouse lawns , listening to old-timers talk about the way things were . I qualify under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Birmingham , Alabama , in a new house on a new golf course . The only stories 1 ever heard were jokes in the locker room . What did at last dawn on me as a medical student and intern , a practitioner , I thought , of the scientific method , was that there is a huge gap in the scientific view of the world . The sector of the world about which science can not utter a single word is nothing less than this : what it is like to be an individual living in the United States in the twentieth century . If the scientist can not address himself to this reality , who can ? My discovery , of course , was that the writer can , and most particularly the novelist . Oddly enough , it was the reading of two nineteenth-century writers , Kierkegaard and Dostoyevsky , which convinced me that only the writer , the existentialist philosopher or the novelist , can explore the gap with all the passion and seriousness and expectation of , say , an Einstein discovering that Newtonian physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel as an instrument for the exploration of reality , let me take notice of two traits of twentieth-century life that are peculiarly open to novelistic treatment and are also the consequence of an all-encompassing scientific-technological world view . One is the isolation , loneliness , and alienation of modern man , as reflected in the protagonists of so many current novels , plays , and films . To a degree , this alienation can be traced , I think , to the surrender , albeit unconscious , of valid forms of human activity to scientists , technologists , and specialists . The other trait is the spectacular emphasis in novels and films on explicit sexual behavior . The convergence of these two traits often results in a novel or film about a man or woman who , though isolated in the midst of 200 million Americans and rendered , so to speak , incommunicado , embarks on a series of sexual encounters which at the end leave the individual much as we found him or her , still isolated , still surrounded by a cocoon of silence . This depiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the one hand , one can say fairly , and I for one believe , that there is such a thing as pornography and that there are a large number of bad writers and bad filmmakers who make a lot of money by writing novels and making movies designed to sexually excite the reader and viewer . I will say no more about pornography than that it has nothing to do with literature . What has happened , I think , is that with the ongoing impoverishment of human relations by the scientific ethos which pervades the Western world , it inevitably came to pass that for many people , both readers and writers , genital sexuality came to be seen as the only , the " real , " the basic form of human intercourse . It is a matter of what we come to see as real , which is taken to be genital and libidinal . Take a film like Last Tango in Paris ? which I happen not to think a very good movie . But I do not think it pornographic either . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of sexual operations on each other , mostly in dead silence , and in the end one kills the other . Two things happen : impersonal sex and dispassionate violence . Perhaps these are the only things that can happen . A case might be made that , given a certain urban environment and an educated class of laymen alienated from one another and from themselves , only three real options remain genital sex , violence , and , perhaps the realest of all , death . Sex , violence , and death are real enough , but is anything else real ? And if not , is the work of the novelist and filmmaker simply the documentation and cataloguing of this impoverishment of the real in contemporary life ? I suggest an alternative for the novelist , which is perhaps more radical , at least more venturesome and challenging , than a mere documentation of isolation , depersonalized sex , and violence . If there is no such alternative , then we should have quit with Kafka , who limited human activity to a few moves to and fro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature in the dark where one gropes , touches , feels , perhaps copulates , perhaps does not , then goes one 's own blind way . What I suggest is that there lies at hand for the artist , especially the novelist , an instrument for exploring the darkness of Kafka 's burrow or Marlon Brando 's unfurnished apartment , an instrument in every sense as scientific and as cognitive as , say , Galileo 's telescope or Wilson 's cloud chamber . Indeed , this may be the only instrument we have for exploring the great gap in our knowing , the only instrument that allows us to know ourselves and how it stands between ourselves and others . This instrument is of course art in general and literature in particular . But what is the function of literature in a period like this , a time when one era has ended and the new era has not yet come into being , that is to say , has not yet articulated itself , does not even have a name ? One important function of fiction in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploratory . If Fielding 's Tom Jones is a celebration of life in eighteenth-century England , the fiction of our time is more like Robinson Crusoe , whose hero has been shipwrecked on a desert island ? with important differences . This island is even stranger than Crusoe 's . For one thing , although it is overpopulated , many of its inhabitants feel as lonely as Crusoe . For another thing , Crusoe saw himself as an intact member of European Christendom , and even a desert island as a tissue of meaningful signs , Such and such an animal track spelled danger . Such and such a fruit meant eat me . He knew what to do . But the castaway of the twentieth-century novel does not know who he is , where he came from , what to do , and the signs on his island are ambiguous . If he does encounter another human , a man Friday , he has trouble communicating with him . Certainly if two postmodern men met on an island today like Crusoe and Friday , neither would dream of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be converted from and converted to . Perhaps some sort of sexual encounter is possible , perhaps a joint scientific venture ; certainly murder is possible . But what else ? Then what is the task of serious fiction in an age when both the Judeo-Christian consensus and rational humanism have broken down ? I suggest that it is more than a documentation of the loneliness and the varieties of sexual encounters of so much modern fiction . I suggest that it is nothing less than an exploration of the options of postmodern man . That is , a man who not only is in Crusoe 's predicament , a castaway of sorts , but is also acutely aware of his predicament . What did Crusoe do ? He poked around . He explored the island . He scanned the horizon . He looked for signs from across the seas . He combed the beach for what ? Perhaps for bottles with messages in them . No doubt he also launched bottles with messages in them . But what kind of messages ? That is the question . What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , must be an epistemologist of sorts . He must know how to send messages and decipher them . The messages may come not in bottles but rather in the halting and muted dialogue between strangers , between lovers and friends . One speaks , the other tries to fathom his meaning ? or indeed to determine if the message has any meaning . Compare recent fiction with the community taken for granted in the traditional novel , for example , the reception described at the beginning of 44 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE JUNE War and Peace , where Anna Paylovna and her guests discuss the Napoleonic wars . Conversation occurs , looks are exchanged , all perfectly understood in a community of shared meanings and assumptions . To change the island image , the community of discourse in the current novel might be likened to two prisoners who find themselves in adjoining cells as a consequence of some vague , Kafka-like offense . Communication is possible by tapping against the intervening wall . Do they speak the same language ? The quasi-conversations or non-conversations of two such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sartre to Beckett to Pinter to Joseph McElroy . If this view sounds gloomy , allow me to express a kind of perverse hope and preference . I do n't know whether this is a symptom of my own neurosis or whether it says something about the way things are . In a word , I 'd rather be a prisoner in a cell tapping messages to a fellow prisoner in the twentieth century than be a guest at Anna Pavlovna 's reception in Moscow in 1805 . The challenge now is both more critical and more exciting than the defeat of Napoleon . For the challenge now is nothing less than the exploration of a new world and the re-creation or rediscovery of language and meanings . ut to go back to my thesis , the diagnostic and cognitive role of modem fiction . When one age ends and the traditional cultural symbols no longer work , man is exposed in all his nakedness , which is uncomfortable for man but revealing for those of us who want to take a good look at him , which is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they are known , it lies within the province of art , literature M particular ? and not the natural sciences ? to undertake this exploration . It is no accident that so much of modem fiction has converged with a movement of European philosophy and that the same name , the much overworked term existentialist , has been applied to both . For both approaches , say , Kierkegaard 's in philosophy and Dostoyevsky 's in fiction , share a view in common , that of man , not mankind , but a particular man who finds himself in some fashion isolated from the world and society around him ; a society in which both the philosophy and the fiction are viewed as more or less absurd , if not moribund . This man is then viewed as alienated from his culture , not as an abstraction , not as specimen Home sapiens alienatus pinned like a dogfish to a dissecting board , but rather as an individual set down in a time and a place and a predicament . The subject of the novel may be outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute than that of Prince Andrey Bolkonsky lying wounded in the Battle of Borodino . He may be sitting alone in a caf ? , listening to the conversation of the bourgeoisie in Bouville , or she may be spinning around the interstates or holed up with a stranger in a motel like a character in a Joan Didion novel . In any case , what is being explored and set forth in this kind of serious novel is not primarily the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie or the wasteland of Los Angeles but the fundamental predicament of the character himself or herself . Accordingly , what is being explored or should be explored is not only the nature of the human predicament but the possibility or non-possibility of a search for signs and meanings . Depending on the conviction of the writer , the signs may be found to be ambiguous or meaningless ? or perhaps a faint message comes through , a tapping on the wall heard and deciphered and replied to . The point is that all fiction can be used as an instrument of exploration and discovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when things and people are devalued , when meanings break down , it lies within the province of the novelist to start the search afresh , like Robinson Crusoe on his island . The novelist or poet in the future might be able to discover , or rediscover , how it is with man himself , who he is , and how it is between him and other men .
