Andrew Quigley is hunched behind his 1937 Underwood typewriter at the Chelsea Record when a woman enters his office . She does not want to place a news item or wedding announcement . She ' s come to ask for a job in a school cafeteria. - Quigley is chairing a School Committee meeting in the City Hall chambers . As Committeeman Anthony ( Chubby ) Tiro expounds on the plight of Chelsea High ' s losing football team , a Record reporter covering the meeting appears to be daydreaming . Quigley catches her attention and his hands scribble in the air on an imaginary pad . She gets the message and resumes taking notes . An account of Tiro ' s proposal will flesh out an upcoming sports page. - Thirty years ago , when Quigley was serving as both Chelsea ' s mayor and state senator , the city ' s aldermen criticized his dual role in a resolution stating that he could not " serve two masters without hurting one or the other . " These days , Quigley ' s opponents again are charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chairman of the Chelsea School Committee - conflict , especially because journalists and public officials are traditional antagonists . They say owning a newspaper gives him an unfair advantage , and that his public position raises doubts about his paper ' s news coverage . They point to Quigley ' s diatribes in the Record against former school committeeman and longtime political foe Abraham Morochnick , who recently won $3000 in a suit against Quigley for trying to have him fired from his job . Quigley bought the Chelsea Record late in 1976 , and left the School Committee in 1977 . After Quigley was elected to the committee again in 1979 , Morochnick brought a conflict-of-interest suit , which was dismissed . As School Committee chairman , the 56-year-old Quigley skirmishes with Supt. Vincent McGee , monitoring the school budget to the extent that he refused to sign an $89 voucher for McGee ' s Wall Street Journal subscription . As Record editor , he writes all the headlines and some news stories for Chelsea ' s only daily newspaper . His editorials and columns praise , rebuke or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office cluttered with photos and maps of a bygone Chelsea , journalism awards and stacks of newspapers , Quigley looks like a character in " Shoe , " the comic strip about an editor , rather than heir to a Chelsea political tradition stretching back 60 years . But his office also contains political mementoes - the chair he used in the state Senate and a 1950 photograph of him with John F. Kennedy , then a congressman . He sees no clash between his two roles . " The only people who complain about conflict of interest are the ones who can ' t get elected , " Quigley said in a recent interview . His comments dig at Morochnick , defeated for re-election to the School Committee in 1979 after Quigley wrote that he had a dream Morochnick would lose . " I ' m not the type to go rushing into court , " he says . " Everybody ' s scared of Abe , because he ' s going to sue them . I refuse to be intimidated . " Morochnick , born in Manchuria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrating to the Boston area in the 1950s . Friends describe him as upright and apolitical ; critics see him as a gadfly . To Morochnick , who was elected to the committee in 1975 , Quigley personifies the laissez-faire political climate of Chelsea . The feud between Quigley and Morochnick began , some say , when Morochnick successfully pressured the School Committee to choose an outsider as superintendent . After McGee was hired for that job nine years ago , Quigley soon became disenchanted with his independent ways . Morochnick became a McGee supporter - and an inveterate critic of Quigley . It was also during this period that Quigley had to resign a $22,500 post as coordinator of development of the Naval Hospital area , when Morochnick alleged in a suit that Quigley as a School Committee member could not hold a city job . Morochnick won the most recent battle between them last year when he was awarded damages in a suit against Quigley charging harassment . Superior Court Judge George N. Hurd Jr . found that the editor telephoned Morochnick ' s employers at the Erich Lindemann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for absenteeism . He also found that Quigley , posing over the telephone as a reporter for a " Chelsea Record spotlight team , " would inquire at Lindemann about Morochnick ' s whereabouts . Hurd , however , dismissed libel allegations in the same suit , characterizing Quigley ' s articles about Morochnick as no more than a " melange of intemperate twaddle . " Both sides have appealed the decision , Morochnick because he is unsatisfied with the amount of the settlement . As publisher and public official , Quigley treads a tightrope . For example , he is forbidden to divulge confidential information from his committee ' s executive sessions , even if it is news . The competing Chelsea Weekly News recently scooped the Record on the firing of Chelsea High ' s football coach , even though Quigley had known about it . Quigley could only rail against news leaks . The Record , which was enfeebled by a long strike when Quigley purchased it , has grown during his tenure from eight to 14 pages and its circulation is now 4400 . His oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sports editor , and his other three sons and a small staff help out . Quigley copies the docket at the police station at 6 a.m. , takes photos that are coyly attributed to " A.N . Drew , " and delivers the finished product to stores . His " Short and Sweet " columns seem vague but are actually replete with sly references to Chelsea people and politics . Not surprisingly , Quigley ' s opponents say they can not tell where Quigley the politician leaves off and Quigley the editor begins . " It ' s a centralization of power that ' s scary in a small community , " says Michael Heichman , 36 , an activist in the Chelsea teachers ' union . He says the unionrarely can arouse public support because the School Committee and the local paper , both headed by Quigley , oppose its demands . Says Supt. McGee : " School Committee members have sometimes felt one way but voted another , because they were worried that the Record would blast them or their names would never appear . " Quigley ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many friends , he would have political influence , public position or not . Whether people feel Quigley goes too far often depends not so much on their philosophical notions of conflict of interest but more on their views of the man himself . He is alternately denounced as a power-broker and praised for his Chelsea lore , self-deprecating humor , story-telling and florid oratory , with its allusions to Shakespeare and Wordsworth . He recently left a telephone message with a receptionist that was a quotation from Charles Dickens : " Barkus is willing . " Quigley conducts School Committee meetings with a flourish , apologizing to an audience of one if the meeting starts a few minutes late . Members like the way he rushes business along - although he may pause for grandiloquence , declaiming " undiluted and unalloyed " pride in the football team , for example . Many Chelsea residents compare him with James Michael Curley , and Quigley is openly wistful for the Curley era of patronage and tribal loyalty . " There was a time , if my father appointed a member of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his as long as he ran for office , " he says . " Political gratitude has been replaced by What have you done for me lately ? ' " At the trial before Judge Hurd , Quigley was asked if he had tried to have Morochnick dismissed from his job . He replied , " I never urged that anybody be fired in my life . It has been spent , if I may say so with some modesty , in getting people jobs . . . " Quigley , the son of Lawrence Quigley , who was mayor for 11 years , became a state representative at 22 , state senator at 24 and mayor at 25 for two terms in the 1950s . He still likes to be addressed as " Senator . " His only elective office in recent years has been on the School Committee , where he has served for a quarter-centur y . Now he seems to view himself as Chelsea ' s father figure - " old Andrew , " as he calls himself in his Record column . He takes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 campaign for School Committee , he upbraided Morochnick for not saluting the flag at public meetings . Later he led an unsuccessful crusade to ban an anthology containing a poem with what was called obscene language from city schools . Morochnick was the only committee member who did not support Quigley . Quigley says his news coverage is objective and opponents have their say in letters and in occasional columns as well . Current and former Record reporters say he rarely , if ever , edits their copy for political reasons . " You write what you want , " says Joshua Resnek , a former Record reporter and now a free-lance writer . " But sometimes you find yourself thinking like your boss . " Quigley ' s foes say his columns often overshadow the Record ' s news coverage . For example , a front page headline on Dec. 17 quoted James Mitchell Jr. , president of the board of aldermen , as calling Quigley a " faker and incredible creep . " Next to that article , however , was Quigley ' s weekly column , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of page 6 . It was largely devoted to assailing Mitchell , in prose punctuated by dashes , like an Emily Dickinson poem . A sample : " Of course , it is aggravating to be called the names that Jim calls people - Mr. Quackley ' - one just has to ask what is the point of such personal abuse ? - And even more people ask - what kind of a person ( who thinks that he should be mayor ) would be so childish as to call other people names ? - It REALLY is so childish - one REALLY has to give serious thought as to what a person thinks who would do such things . " Quigley ' s opponents avail themselves of other media outlets . Morochnick writes frequent letters to the Chelsea Weekly News , and Mitchell makes speeches at aldermen ' s meetings covered by the local cable television station . Thomas Rosa , Weekly News co-publisher and editor , agrees with Quigley that the people of Chelsea should be his judge , and they condone his dual duty by re-electing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chelsea ' s board of assessors . " Let me tell you something , " says Alderman Mitchell . " Eighty percent of the city is in conflict of interest , and the other 20 percent don ' t know any better . "
