Cairo reveals their plots <P> FIVE GROUPS PARTICIPATED IN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION TO SEIZE POWER , cried the headline in Cairo 's semiofficial newspaper Al Ahram . Last week , in a kind of interim report on its investigations into the assassination of Anwar Sadat , government officials said the plot was far wider than had originally been suspected . Right after the killing , officials had insisted that only four men were involved . But according to President Hosni Mubarak , who succeeded Sadat , at least 700 people were part of a web of revolutionaries whose general aim was to overthrow the government . Said Mubarak : " Security in our country is my first concern . " <P> Mubarak 's government , which is clearly trying to arouse public sentiment against Muslim extremists , claims that the five groups were all fundamentalist organizations linked by a conspiracy " to fight the government and seize power . " The ambitions of the conspirators were thwarted on Sept. 25 , when many were arrested during Sadat 's wide-ranging crackdown on dissenters . Concluding that they were not strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on just assassinating the President . After his death , they also thought of dropping bombs from rooftops on the funeral procession as it wound its way through Cairo 's streets . As it turned out , the funeral was held on the carefully guarded parade grounds because of the government 's fears that precisely such tactics might be used . <P> The plotters were well financed and well armed . One ringleader of the group , Abboud Zomor , an ex-army major who deserted , was said to have plotted several ways of killing Sadat . He considered shooting the President at his rest house in the Nile Delta . He also thought of exploding a truckload of butane gas on a Cairo street as Sadat drove by . <P> According to the government , the plan that the conspirators eventually put into effect was the work of an electrical engineer named Abdel Sallam Sallah Farag . He suggested having First Lieut . Khaled Ahmed Shawki el-Istambuli , a member of the Takfir wa Hijra ( Atonement and Holy Flight ) group , and three others shoot Sadat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hideout near the pyramids of Giza . It was also sanctioned by a fundamentalist group in the southern city of Asyut , which had launched attacks on police stations in Asyut soon after Sadat was killed . Finally , the plan was accepted by the plotters ' spiritual leader , a blind mufti named Omar Ahmed Abdel Rahman , who had $20,000 in crisp new bills concealed in his underclothing when he was arrested after the assassination . <P> Once Sadat had been killed , a leader of the group , Dr. Amin Youssef el Demeri , asked Abboud Zomor to delay any move to overthrow the government until a more careful plan could be worked out . Whether the conspirators were strong enough to take over at that point is doubtful . In any case , security forces moved in and arrested many of the plotters before they could take further action .
