Mondale seeks a running mate and party unity <P> Help Wanted : Someone " to advise the President from a national perspective , help break through the bureaucracy and solve complex problems , speak for the President on Capitol Hill and help advance his legislative program . Must be ready to assume the duties of the toughest job on earth . " Applicants will be interviewed by Walter Mondale in North Oaks , Minn . By invitation only . <P> <P> The Democratic Party 's probable ( and self-proclaimed ) presidential candidate last week outlined his job description for a running mate , and the prime prospects awaited their pilgrimage to North Oaks . Despite the slightly imperious overtones of the summoning , it promises to be an ego trip for the invitees , who will bask in press attention and at least fleetingly enjoy the heady notion that he or she could be tapped for the nation 's second-highest office . Walter Mondale , recalling his own trek to Plains , Ga. , eight years ago , was following the same selection process that had taken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue the invitations now . <P> New York Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro , who heads the party 's platform committee , visited the St. Paul suburb on Saturday , ostensibly to talk about platform planks . She is to be followed this week by Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen and San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein . <P> The most intriguing question is whether Colorado Senator Gary Hart , who is having trouble adjusting to his apparent status as an also-ran , would take ( or be offered ) the No. 2 spot . His aides said it was unlikely he would submit to an interview process that smacked of supplication , but they were split on whether he ought to join the ticket if asked . Advisers Patrick Caddell , Kathy Bushkin and John McEvoy contend that Hart 's future would best be served by becoming Mondale 's partner in their party 's challenge to Ronald Reagan , even if the effort fails . Oliver Henkel , Frank Mankiewicz and Jack Quinn still foresee the possibility that a political disaster could cripple Mon dale before the convention . <P> They want their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination battle at full steam . <P> According to a new Gallup poll , 59% of Democrats want a Mondale-Hart ticket , compared with only 27% who prefer Mondale with an other running mate . The same poll was bad news for the Hart advisers who still hope to draw delegates away from Mondale by arguing that the Senator would run a stronger race against Reagan . It showed the President ahead of Mondale , 53% to 44% , and leading Hart by virtually the same margin , 54% to 43% . <P> Hart did not seem anxious to pave the way for party unity when he appeared in Washington before Ferraro 's platform committee . Although Hart did not mention Mondale , he urged the committee to reject " the traditional approach of some in our party who promise everything to everyone . " He warned that " the Democratic Party can not win if it is beholden to the old arrangements . " Specifically , Hart opposed " a protectionist trade policy based on the proposed domestic content bill , " which would require a share of American materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly endorsed such legislation .
