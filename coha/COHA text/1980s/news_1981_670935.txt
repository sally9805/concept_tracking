Inflation has contributed to a cost of living that the State Department ranks second only to Japan ' s . The daily newspaper costs 60 cents . A cup of coffee in an ordinary coffee shop costs $1 . Rents for a two-bedroom apartment in areas equivalent to Manhattan ' s Upper East and West Sides begin at $2 , 000 a month. // The causes are lost in mounds of statistics and competing economic theories . The effects are found in jammed stores and crowded psychiatrists ' offices , in a national cynicism and - sometimes - individual sadness that has helped replace the country ' s reputation for gaiety . <> <> Fast Money and Hard Luck // " For 10 years we have have been told things will get better , " said Alberto Piro as he arranged the fruits and vegetables in his small shop . " Now we are just waiting for better times. " // In the meantime , Argentines have turned to ingenuity , creating a country of speculators and moonlighters , of fast money and hard luck . Playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates - and no one commits his money for longer - pay interest at an annual rate of about 100 percent. // People punching pocket calculators stand outside bank windows daily , studying the day ' s posted rates . In the last year more than 40 small banks and financial houses have collapsed in the wheeling and dealing . While rumors that a place is about to fold lead most people to start a run on the institution , the more daring increase their deposits , hoping to reap higher rates and be saved by Government guarantees on deposits. // But then consumers pay even more for mortgages , automobile loans and the like . Interest is usually indexed to inflation , so buying on credit is an adventure into the unknown on payments . <> <> A Scheme With a Flaw // Interest rates are so high that American bankers here are courted by Argentines wanting loans of several million dollars , which they convert to pesos and deposit in local banks , often earning enough interest in a month to pay back the loan and make a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate outstrips devaluations . In the last two months , however , the Government has devalued the peso 40 percent . Some instant millionaires have become instant paupers , although most anticipated the devaluation and created a run on foreign reserves by switching into dollars , marks , yen and gold. // The speculation has helped create a large class of nouveaux riches who have turned this city ' s stately old neighborhood of Barrio Norte into canyons of high-rises and choking auto fumes. // The wealthy , new and old , hedge in the Argentine tradition of sending money to Zurich and buying land - or at least apartments - in Punta del Este , Miami and New York as well as here . <> <> ' Horror ' Story About Maids // But there are also losers , even among the rich . One matronly dowager who was approached in a food market complained bitterly . Before , she had two live-in maids . Now she has only one maid come twice a week . " A horror , " she said. // Picking among the onions and apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American who lives here , said , " Many people here are putting on a show of living well even though they are on the verge of bankruptcy and can not pay the rent. " // The Economics Ministry says real income has risen over the last several years . Certainly many Argentines from bankers to plumbers have done well . Many have salaries indexed to the inflation rate , and many people who set their own fees , such as doctors and carpenters , charge almost at will . Having a baby , for example , costs $5 , 000 in private medical and hospital fees. // It is this new middle class that hedges in the panoply of imported appliances such as juicers and color televisions that have been flooding stores . The military Government has been dropping import tariffs in the hope that the competition of cheaper and better imported goods would cut prices on domestic goods. // Factory workers , who have benefitted from erratic past protectionist policies , are thus less fortunate this time around . Their companies are strapped by the competition and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the military fears workers ' reaction. // In February , the Institute of Economic Investigation of the University of Buenos Aires surveyed 300 major factories in the capital area and found that it takes workers longer to earn the price of such basic items as bread and milk than it did a year ago . Wine was one of the few items to be cheaper in terms of working time. // Argentina , nonetheless , is a primarily middle-class country that still enjoys the highest standard of living in Latin America . Unskilled laborers in the survey earned up to $8 , 700 a year , while skilled workers earned $4 , 000 to $15 , 000 and their plant supervisors earned up to $28 , 000 . <> <> The Retired Suffer the Most // This middle class gambles , too . Some laid-off factory workers have reportedly bought cement and wood , held them , then sold them after the price rose , which is usually within a month. // The majority , however , appear to do as Mr. Piro does . His Falcon is 11 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television and new refrigerator he would like. // The retired suffer the most . Two weeks ago , the military Government decreed a quarterly increase of 16 percent for all pensioners . Buenos Aires municipal taxes will rise 150 percent this year . The Economics Ministry has ordered an increase of over 15 percent in all utility charges over the next three months. // But storekeepers can not so easily multiply their prices . " You can not raise your prices too much , " Jose Maria Llama , a butcher , said . " People get scared and do not buy. " // The pressures have contributed to what many psychiatrists and psychologists say is an explosion in recent years in the number of people who seek their help. // " You do not learn to live with the inflation , " the owner of a fabric shop said . " You learn how to adapt to live with the constant economic anxiety. " //
