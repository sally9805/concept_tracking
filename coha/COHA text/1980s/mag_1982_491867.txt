ne of the newest trends in childbirth is also one of the oldest . Women are again returning to the birthing chair as a means of having babies after 200 years of modern medical intervention , making a full circle in terms of a common-sense approach to giving birth . Giving birth in an upright position is easier because gravity aids in the expulsion of the baby by the mother . Various investigators have learned that upright birthing speeds the labor process and facilitates the delivery of the infant . According to Grantly Dick-Read , M.D. , well-known author of The Natural Childbirth Primer , " It an upright position is the attitude of squatting with the weight on the lower back instead of on the feet . The size of the pelvic outlet is at its biggest , and the muscles required to press down are free to work their hardest when squatting . " The woman can see her baby born and the midwife or doctor can deliver the infant in the correct manner to prevent injury at the outlet . " Educated women today want and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some women are opting to have their babies at home , many women are n't comfortable with the idea that , should an unforeseen emergency arise , medical help would not be readily available , However , many women believe deliveries should n't occur in a cold , sterile environment , but rather that the husband and perhaps even the other children should be involved in a happy , family-centered birthing experience . Since most deliveries are indeed natural physiological events with little need for medical intervention , many hospitals are installing birthing beds or chairs in a family birthing room , which may be nicely decorated with homey-looking beds , tables and drapes . It is hoped that , by giving women these options , they will continue to have their babies in the hospital , where sophisticated medical help will be close should there be a need for it . Two things that women are increasingly asking for are to give birth in the upright position and to be able to help in the expulsion of the baby by pushing . Research shows that an upright position makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman feel that she is in control of the process , rather than the birth being controlled by the doctor and the medical staff . Dr. Forrest H. Howard , M.D. , wrote in " Delivery in the Physiologic Position " in the medical journal Obstetrics and Gynecology , " It is my belief that nature designed a form and method for parturition childbirth which makes the best allowance for the stresses of hydraulic and mechanical forces . " Many hospitals in the U.S. , as well as in other developed countries , are purchasing and using birthing chairs and upright birthing beds , both of which support the mother in the upright position during the process of labor and birth , yet enable the doctors to supervise the birth from a helpful vantage point . Mothers can enjoy the advantages of being in an upright position  --  less time in labor , a sense of being in control and a lessened go ahead and deliver in it , too . It 's that comfortable . " Dr. Thomas Downey , also on the staff at Home Hospital , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many  --  for both mothers and doctors . Women who deliver in the birthing chair are , in general , women who do not wish to have large amounts of anesthesia . They may take some local anesthesia , but not spinals . And , of course , the less medication used during delivery , the better it is for the mother and for the baby . The mother recovers faster and feels better after the delivery . The babies are n't born with depressed respiratory functions , and if the mother breast feeds , which more and more mothers are doing now , fewer medications will enter the baby 's bloodstream . " Doctor Downey added , " That may be why other hospitals have chosen not to buy the birthing chair ; that is , they have a very high rate of patients who get spinal anesthesia . Also the Caesarean rate is high in some hospitals due to herpes . As many as 90 percent of women deliver with at least an epidural Rower level spinal anesthesia or a Caesarean in some hospitals . So the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be few and far between . However , it is now believed that herpes sufferers can deliver in the chair if they choose to . Caesarean sections are required only if the mother has an active outbreak of the herpes virus . " Not only does use of a birthing chair seem to be easier on the mother-to-be , it also is easier on the hospital 's budget . According to Dr. Mentzer , " I think it costs $5,400 . A delivery table is about $10,000 and a birthing bed is about $10,000 . " " Compared to the cost of the other equipment in this day and age , that is a very reasonable price , " added William Oakes , hospital administrator . Although several U.S. manufacturing companies make delivery tables and beds , only one company makes a delivery chair . Approximately 400 have been sold , although a sizable number of those have been overseas . Asked why this particular hospital is one of the few in the country that has one , one R.N. replied , " We are trying to meet the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our patients in this community-centered hospital . " Dr. Mentzer added , " The patients in the area take a very personal view of the hospital and feel very close to the staff here . When a woman in labor comes in , we take the patient on a tour of the hospital . And when a patient says ' my doctor , ' she really does mean ' my doctor . ' And that 's just not the case in a large medical center . " Another concept that is getting more popular is the idea of having labor , delivery and recovery all in one room . If a mother decides to use the chair , it can be moved into the birthing room for that purpose , then easily moved back out after she delivers . We were thinking of these things when we purchased the chair . " Speaking from a nurse 's standpoint , Cecilia Ritchie , R.N. , head nurse of the obstetrics and gynecology department , reported , " At first , we had trouble getting the mothers to step from the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience helping them . But once we overcame that difficulty , the patients ' acceptance has been tremendous . And anytime the patients feel positive about something , it is a big help to the nursing staff . " It is known that some medical interferences at birth can lead to oxygen deficiency in the newborn baby . These include the lithotomy childbirth position ( flat on the back with knees up , which causes hypotension ) , immobility ( from being strapped down ) , scalp electrode fetal monitoring , drugs and forceps  --  some of which are necessary at times , but all of which are potentially harmful to the newborn baby . Paracervical anesthesia  --  local anesthesia injected into the cervical tissue  --  can be used effecJan. /Feb. ' 82 tively in a birthing chair . It carries little risk to the mother or baby and is used by many women who opt for " natural " childbirth . Sitting up while giving birth takes pressure off the inferior vena cava , a major blood vessel that returns blood to the mother 's heart and aids the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , helps insure an adequate oxygen supply for the baby throughout the birth , If the mother 's blood pressure goes down and the baby experiences a lowered oxygen level , this may or may not have lasting effects on the infant , depending on how severe the deprivation is . If a problem develops in addition to the already lowered oxygen level of a mother lying on her back , the results can be disastrous for the baby . Research has suggested that cerebral palsy , which is caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain during the birthing process , may be more common among babies born to women lying down while birthing . Dr. Forrest Howard stated in his article , " Figures on the probability of birth trauma vary . The Cerebral Palsy Association has given a tentative rate of the incidence of cerebral palsy as between one in 50 to one in 200 live births . This series of 220deliveries ' which Dr. Howard performed with women giving birth in an upright position with no such sequelae compares favorably with the latter figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Dr. A. Towbin in the Archives of Pathology , " can lay the foundation for the ultimate blighting of mentation , for the appearance of motor defects , which characterize cerebral palsy , and for the development of epilepsy . " With the brain marred at birth , the potential may be reduced from that of a genius to that of a plain child or less . The damage may be slight and imperceptible , or it may spell the difference between brothers , one a dexterous athlete and one an awkward child . So the fetus and newborn are highly vulnerable to injury . Biologically the maternal-fetal relationship is delicately balanced . The placenta has a narrow margin of safety . The hypoxia which can so devastate the brain can develop before or after birth . " Although more research is needed due to the " newness " of using an upright position for childbirth , no research so far has shown it to be harmful . Dr. Howard concluded , " By use of the physiologic upright position for normal deliveries , and even for borderline normal deliveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child should have a better chance of survival . Admittedly , this would be almost impossible to prove statistically , for the skill of the individual obstetrician and factors such as toxemia in the mother , hypoxia and other considerations necessarily influence results . However , the burden of proof should lie with the overwhelming majority of obstetricians who use the recumbent , the lithotomy or the Sims positions , which are unphysiologic and abnormal . It is not claimed that the use of the physiologic position will prevent all instances of cerebral palsy , but it is believed that its use will reduce the number and that such reduction will be among those with uncomplicated pregnancies . Delivery in the physiologic position , which is a sitting or squatting position , is practical , satisfactory from the mother 's viewpoint and should result in less intracranial to the head damage to the child than is now encountered by the use of the various recumbent positions . " For thousands of years , women squatted or sat when they gave birth . Giving birth in an upright position was practiced until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of midwives . The birthing chair was rejected by physicians as a symbol of midwifery . Francois Mauriceau , the physician who delivered the several babies of the queen of France , said in 1738 that it was easier for the physician if the woman was reclining instead of squatting . Such an attitude espoused by the doctors who were replacing midwives in attending births helped cause the birthing chair to become considered " outdated " and ultimately to pass from common usage . New interest in the birthing chair seems to be a result of modern women 's interest in natural childbirth and in wanting to do whatever is best for the baby to insure it a healthy life . Medical professionals are finding that an older , more innate approach to normal childbirth is perhaps best . Good old-fashioned common sense does have a place in modern medicine , along with all of the medical advances which are so necessary when people do need expert and thorough medical care .                   @ @
