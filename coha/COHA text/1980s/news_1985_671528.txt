On Saturday at Aqueduct , Lukas will send out an astoundingly large flock of 10 horses to contest four of the seven Breeders ' Cup races , almost all of them heavy favorites . So racing ' s climactic day of the year has in large part become a showcase for Lukas ' s training . The issue of which horses will be champions this year will be answered by another question : Can Lukas finally extend his streak of success to the sport ' s top races ? // Lukas ' s entries will be odds-on choices in three of the cup races , and with good reason . In the Distaff , Lukas has Lady ' s Secret , the nation ' s best 3-year-old filly and a winner of eight straight stakes races ; Life ' s Magic , last year ' s champion 3-year-old filly , and Alabama Nana , who has won six stakes or handicaps this year. // In the Juvenile Fillies , Lukas horses will be odds-on again when he saddles Family Style , the top 2-year-old filly in the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Twilight Ridge , who may be faster than both of those . In the Sprint , he has the top older sprint , Mt . Livermore , and the top 3-year-old sprinter , Pancho Villa , either of whom would be favored alone . His only weak hand is the Juvenile , where Ketoh and Louisiana Slew will be outsiders. // In the Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff , the order of finish could be " Lukas , Lukas , Lukas , " a phrase that became a familiar cry after his successes last year with a filly named Lucky Lucky Lucky . This year the phrase would have to be " Lukas times 62 , " because that is the overwhelming number of stakes races his trainees have won. // In August , he passed the record of 45 that had been set by Jimmy Jones of Calumet Farm in 1947 and tied in the 1960 ' s by Eddie Neloy with the Phipps Stable . That same month , he broke his own single-season earnings record , set last year , and his stable now has earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with top thorughbreds only five years ago , Lukas has led the world ' s trainers in stakes victories and money earned . In the same time , he has sent eight horses to the post for the Kentucky Derby , including entries that were Derby favorites twice , and none of them finished better than third ; run three horses in the Belmont Stakes without coming out better than seventh ; won the Preakness with Codex and Tank ' s Prospect but watched both come out of their next starts in the Belmont with career-ending injuries ; sent five horses out in last year ' s Breeders ' Cup races without winning one ; had the star filly Landaluce die of a mysterious infection as a 2-year-old ; had his highly-regarded 2-year-olds Stalwart and Saratoga Six break down , and had other top 3-year-olds , such as Marfa , disappear from top competition after unsuccessful runs in the spring classics. // " I ' ve had a lot more highs and a lot more lows than most people , " Lukas says . " I prefer to dwell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' ve had some absolutely terrible luck with some awfully good 2-year-olds . You can say I ' ve never won the Derby or the Belmont , but I ' ve won the Preakness twice . When you look at what this stable has accomplished , it ' s hard to complain. " // Yet Lukas ' s successes and failures have been too intense and vivid to have been just random instances of good and bad luck . They reflect his ambition and intensity , and are the inevitable result of his style and his methods. // Despite Lukas ' s successes , he has yet to be voted an Eclipse Award as the country ' s leading trainer , an oversight so glaring that it clearly reflects the envy , suspicion and resentment attending his career. // Old-timers can not fathom how Lukas arrived so suddenly . The majority of trainers serve long apprenticeships as assistants , eventually go out on their own on a small scale , gradually build reputations and begin getting better stock . Lukas appeared , seemingly out of nowhere , and now operates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such elite trainers as Woody Stephens or Charlie Whittingham , each of whom has spent 50 years on the track. // Lukas , a former Wisconsin high school basketball coach , grew up around horses and began dealing them even as a teen-ager . After a decade of coaching , he threw himself into training quarter horses full time , and in a business filled with part-timers and amateurs , his single-mindedness and ambition made him a powerhouse . In 1978 , he switched fields again , this time to the thoroughbred racing game with its much higher stakes , and quickly rose to the top once more. // Lukas credits his success to hard work and to what he calls a " winning attitude , " a zeal that is articulated in motivational maxims and an ethic that is reminiscent of Werner Erhard ' s ' est ' and other hard-driving self-help programs . The Lukas operation , which now involves more than 200 horses at four tracks and numerous farms and training centers , is fueled by its leader ' s belief in inspirational techniques and positive thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferocity , to becoming the most successful trainer racing has ever seen. // The Lukas philosophy is partly summed up in a list of maxims displayed on the wall of his Santa Anita headquarters in California . Among the virtues extolled are " the success of perseverance , " " the obligation of duty " and " the wisdom of economy. " // None of it would work , of course , were it not for Lukas ' s brilliant eye for a horse . He picks out , for a variety of free-spending owners who give him a free hand , virtually all of his top runners at yearling sales . He says he looks for athletic appearance first and at pedigree on the catalogue page later. // As a result , there is a typical look to Lukas trainees : They are blocky and muscular rather than classically sleek , reminding some race trackers of his former career with quarter horses . His runners tend to develop quickly and enjoy early or brief success rather than maturing gradually or improving as they continue to race. // Perhaps Lukas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and , in doing so , to develop a revolutionary approach to American stakes racing. // Most trainers are conservative with their good young horses , and understandably so . They spend a lifetime at the trck waiting for that one really special horse , so proceed slowly and carefully when a promising one comes along . Their method usually is to put a long and solid foundation under the horse , give him as much experience as possible before moving him into stakes-class company , allow him to mature and develop. // With Lukas , the approach is the opposite . His aim is to get the most out of a horse as quickly as possible and at the most opportune times . Every year he has a dozen or more 2-year-olds who are good enough to run in stakes races somewhere , and his brilliance is in finding the spots to showcase them. // Whereas most trainers with a good horse want to run him in the big races at the local track , Lukas goes shopping for a spot anywhere that the horse can win . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show him off to best avantage. // A recent example is Sovereign Don , a 2-year-old of this year who Lukas had said all along was probably no better than the fourth or fifth best juvenile in his barn . So Lukas compensated for the colt ' s talent with his own understanding of the American racing calendar . He knew that the early stakes races for 2-year-olds , while prestigious in name and tradition , rarely attract the best 2-year-olds , who are reserved for richer races later in the year. // So Lukas cracked down on Sovereign Don early and sent him out to successive victories in the Tremont , the Saratoga Special and the Sanford . By the time races such as the Hopeful and Champagne came along , Sovereign Don could not keep up , but he had already won more than $300 , 000 in purses and , eventually , a career as a stallion. // Lukas has had unparalleled success flying horses around the country in search of winning spots . He believes , and the results seem to confirm it , that horses tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day or two of arriving in new surroundings after a plane trip . He has even flown horses from the East Coast to the West Coast and then back again to reap this benefit , a move that won him the Preakness with Tank ' s Prospect earlier this year . That colt broke down in the Belmont Stakes , a race for which he was not at his best and which Lukas did not expect to win . But the Preakness made him a valuable breeding prospect. // Lukas ' s style has undoubtedly been a help in closing these deals . A smooth talker with a dazzling set of teeth and a good tailor , he has a hypnotic effect on listeners . He is more schooled and skilled in rhetoric and persuasiveness than most horsemen , who come off seeming rougher and even less capable in contrast to Lukas ' s glibness and charm . There is nothing phony about Lukas ' s slick persona : He believes he is that good and knows how to make other people think he is , but also backs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racing fits the current climate of the sport , in which meteoric successes can be turned into attractive breeding portfolios and there is more money to be made in stud fees than race purses , it also fits the Breeders ' Cup scheme perfectly . The point system used to determine most of the cup ' s starting berths rewards success in stakes races around the country , and since Lukas will fly a horse anywhere for these events , his horses amass plenty of points. // The cup races , though , are going to be a lot tougher . Although 32 of Lukas ' s stakes victories this year have come in New York , where his son , Jeff , runs the stable , he has picked his spots carefully . The cup races , like the Derby and the Belmont , attract the best horses from everywhere . ( Lukas ' s two Preakness victories came in peculiar years , one amid a weak crop of colts in 1980 and the other in the absence of the Derby winner , Spend a Buck , this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toughest competition they have ever faced on Saturday , but they still look tough to beat . While there are plausible upsetters in each field , Lukas probably has the best horses in those races. // But with the exception of Twlight Ridge , out all summer with injured shins , all of Lukas ' s horses are heavily raced . The question Saturday may be whether they have one more top race left in them for this year , or whether they are spent from winning all the minor battles on the road to the cup. // Five Eclipse Awards are at stake in the four races with Lukas horses . Whoever wins the Juvenile Fillies is likely to be the nation ' s champion 2-year-old filly . Lady ' s Secret could wrap up the 3-year-old filly championship in the Distaff , and Alabama Nana and Life ' s Magic are both contenders for the older-filly title . Mt . Livermore could clinch the champion sprinter title in the Sprint , and an upset victory by Ketoh would win him some votes as the champion 2-year-old colt. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win five championships this year , and possible that they would win none . Considering his string of defeats in the very biggest races , Lukas can hardly be confident about any titles until Saturday night . But considering his string of successes everywhere else in the sport , he can be fairly sure about winning one Eclipse Award this year , the one for the champion trainer. //
