GJON MILI : PHOTOGRAPHS &; RECOLLECTIONS <P> New York Graphic ; 249pages ; $40 <P> In a sense , Gjon Mili is the Marcel Du-champ of photography . As a trained engineer he pioneered the use of electronic flash and multiple-exposure photographs , then , in 1938 , started doing stories for LIFE magazine . There he revolutionized his art and influenced two generations of journalists . " Time could truly be made to stand still , " he recalls in this extraordinary book of prose and picture recollections . " Texture could be retained despite sudden , violent movement . " The book includes a fair number of famous Mili pictures doing just that : his own version of Duchamp 's Nude Descending a Staircase ; the 37-mm cannon shell stopped at one-millionth of a second as it leaves the nose of a fighter plane ; Pitcher Carl Hubbell 's arm and hand caught in the act of committing a knuckle ball ; Ballerina Nora Kaye transformed into a tornado of multiple images during a pas de bourre ; Pablo Picasso holding a penlight in his darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> These alone would make a brilliant volume . Mili offers more . Nobody has photographed dance , theater and performing musicians better than he did . His visions of Florence and Chartres Cathedral are almost enough to make a trip to either place unnecessary . With great compression the book also tells the story of Mill 's life from the time he emigrated from Rumania and went to M.I.T. as a skinny teenager , to the journey back to Bucharest 48 years later to visit his mother 's grave . Free of the technical gush that sometimes afflicts photographers exposed to print , Mili offers brief notes on the art of portraiture , illustrating them with dramatically juxtaposed pictures of famous people , among them Pablo Casals , Adolf Eichmann , Jean Paul Sartre , Alfred Hitchcock and Henri Matisse . Perhaps the best is Sean O'Casey , a perfect proof that color film does not always destroy the power and the mood of a portrait . <P> The old Irish playwright , almost blind , appears in his shabby , shadowy room , warmed by a dark red blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind and spirit . On the basis of his memoirs , that is just what Gjon Mili appears to be . <P> - By Timothy Foote
