The President of the United States offered his vision of a safer world , and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union 's Communist Party did not believe a word of it . As the two superpower leaders sat across from each other last week at the bargaining table in an elegant salon in Geneva , Ronald Reagan implored Mikhail Gorbachev to join him in his dream of " rendering nuclear weapons obsolete " with a space-based missile defense system . Coldly fixing Reagan in his gaze , Gorbachev would have none of it . " It 's not convincing . It 's emotional . It 's a dream . Who can control it ? Who can monitor it ? It opens up an arms race in space . " <P> In a purposely calm voice , Reagan responded , " As I said to you , I have a right to think you want to use your missiles against us . With mere words we can not abolish the threat . " <P> Frustrated , Gorbachev exclaimed , " Why do n't you believe us when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As Reagan tried to speak , Gorbachev interrupted , " Please answer me , Mr. President . What is your answer ? " Again Reagan began to reply ; again Gorbachev angrily insisted , " Answer my simple question ! " <P> Finally , Reagan was able to utter a reply : " I can not say to the American people that I could take you at your word if you do n't believe us . " <P> Rarely have the inexorable forces of history been so starkly revealed by an exchange between two world leaders . Despite all the public handshakes and smiles , and despite the apparent rapport that emerged between two confident and forceful men last week , they were caught by a stark axiom of the Soviet-American rivalry : neither side can afford to base the security of a nation on trust alone . For 40 years , ever since the earliest days of the cold war , each American President , each Kremlin leader , has felt compelled to counter every move by a countermove , every new weapon with a newer weapon , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two hands that control the planet 's survival may clasp in a show of summit cordiality , but measurable progress to curtail their nuclear arsenals requires far , far more than ceremonial displays of goodwill . <P> And yet , as Reagan and Gorbachev met at the summit last week , the eleventh such meeting between the U.S. and Soviet leaders in the past three decades , they knew , and reminded each other , that there can be no winners in a nuclear war . For two days , as the world warily watched , the two men groped for some kind of human understanding , some way to master the nuclear riddle . Meeting face to face for the first time , Reagan and Gorbachev tried to set some rules to contain the arms race , some guidelines to rein in their rivalries . <P> That they failed in the brief time allowed was perhaps inevitable . That they tried , and agreed to keep on trying , was good news after six years of stonewalling and invective at long range . Equally important , the frank but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore up support back home , without which neither leader can deliver on any good intentions .
