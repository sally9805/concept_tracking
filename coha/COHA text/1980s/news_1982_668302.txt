Two years in a row , America ' s Team has lost its conference championship game , last year to the Eagles and yesterday to the 49ers . It ' ll be a long winter in Texas , said the Cowboys ' Havey Martin after the Cowboys dropped the NFC final , 28-27 , to the 49ers , " because this loss was the worst . " The tone for the Cowboys was somber , edging on bitter , because Dallas was confident of beating San Francisco , notwithstanding the 49ers ' 45-17 blowout win during the regular season . " The Eagle loss in the playoffs last season was not as hard to take as this one , " said Dallas QB Danny White . " This is worsebecause we felt coming out here we had the best team in the league . " " It really hurts to lose like this , " said running back Ron Springs . " I ' d rather get blown out . We didn ' t respect the 49ers during the regular season when we played them , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn ' t . " I still think we ' re a much better ballclub than the 49ers , " said Dallas receiver Tony Hill . " I don ' t feel they ' re the caliber of our ballclub . If we played them tomorrow , we ' d beat them . . . I ' m sure of that . " Both Hill and Drew Pearson were critical of the Dallas game plan , and each said White should have thrown the ball more often to his wide receivers . Hill and Pearson caught only three passes between them , " and we just weren ' t calling the wideout receivers ' numbers today . We should have exploited their defense more , but I think coach ( Tom ) Landry wanted to play more of a ball- control game . " Pearson was more critical . " I could make the plays against these guys , " said the veteran receiver . " Everybdy said this was supposed to be my kind of game . I had two rookies on me , and I ' m not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on them . I went to the sidelines and told them that . . . you saw what happened out there . " But White ( " The 49ers put great pressure on us ; we were never really able to establish a passing attack " ) completed 16 of 24 passes for only 173 yards , Tony Dorsett was held to 91 yards on 22 carries and the Dallas attack was spasmodic to the end . When the Cowboys took over for their final drive in the final minuute , " I was thinking about getting a turnover , " said San Francisco linebacker Willie Haper . " We knew Dallas has one of the great two-minute drills in football and we had to stop them . " But after White threw a 31-yard completion to Pearson , the 49ers came up with their biggest defensive play of the season . Defensive lineman Lawrence Pillers sacked White and caused a fumble , and the Niners ' Jim Stuckey recovered . " We were in a four-man rush , " said Pillers , " and their guy ( guard Kurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went for the quarterback . It wasn ' t my best hit of the season , but it was the most important one . " The ball popped over to Stuckey , " and I held on tight to that football , " he said . " I wasn ' t about to give it up . At that moment , I felt total euphoria . " At the same moment , White was feeling robbed . The Dallas QB contended that he was in the act of throwing when he was hit , " and I told ( referee ) Jim ( Tunney ) that I was throwing the ball . " White lost that argument , Dallas lost the game and the championship , and America ' s Team lost some luster.
