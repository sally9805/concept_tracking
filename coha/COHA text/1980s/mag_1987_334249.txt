Popular mythology has often portrayed scientists as selfless seekers after ultimate truths about the universe . In fact , like ordinary mortals , some researchers are driven as much by ambition and ego gratification as by intellectual curiosity . As the stakes get higher  --  especially when the chance of a Nobel Prize looms  --  that drive sometimes manifests itself in unseemly behavior . <P> A newly published book may further tarnish the image of the loftily motivated scientist . Nobel Dreams : Power , Deceit and the Ultimate Experiment ( Random House ) provides a rare inside look at particle physics , a field increasingly dependent on huge and expensive machines  --  and on scientists who are as adept at fund raising and politicking as they are at probing the subatomic world . Author Gary Taubes provides that view while chronicling the research that won Italian Physicist Carlo Rubbia a share of the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the W and Z particles , which transmit the so- called weak nuclear force . <P> Taubes acknowledges Rubbia 's brilliance . But he argues that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullying and corner cutting . Taubes told TIME that in his opinion Rubbia " has made more mistakes than any major physicist of his era . He has a history of distorting and exaggerating his experimental results . " Says Nobel Laureate Sheldon Glashow , a Harvard colleague of Rubbia 's : " The book is a fair picture . I would make it required reading for anyone who wants to go into this field . " <P> Rubbia , when confronted with charges made in the book , countered that Taubes " has not grasped the mechanisms of discovery processes in large-scale , collaborative science . " He insisted that the author does not understand the give-and-take that normally occurs between members of large scientific teams prior to the formal publication of their results . <P> In researching his book , Taubes , who has a physics degree from Harvard and is a frequent contributor to DISCOVER magazine , talked with more than a hundred current and former Rubbia colleagues . Most of his interviews took place at Geneva 's CERN laboratory , where , Taubes says , Rubbia almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synchrotron ( SPS ) accelerator used to discover the W and Z particles . <P> Some of Taubes ' allegations : in 1964 , at a CERN seminar , Rubbia presented experimental results that two of his co-experimenters claim did not exist . " We were looking for an effect that we did n't find , " explained Rubbia 's colleague . " And yet Carlo gave a seminar . I do n't know where he got the numbers from . I guess he must have invented them . " Those numbers were never &lt; published . In the early 1970s , Rubbia championed a conclusion erroneously drawn from an experiment to measure the probability of particle collisions in an accelerator . Other CERN researchers arrived at a contrary conclusion . But Rubbia , convinced he was right , opposed publication of their work . The competition turned out to be correct . In the mid-1970s , Rubbia collaborated with two Americans in an experiment at Fermilab , near Chicago , on interactions of ghostly particles called neutrinos , and drew an interpretation that the team 's underlings considered dubious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others later proved him wrong .
