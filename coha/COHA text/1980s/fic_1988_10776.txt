LEON URISMy introduction to my new father-in-law was a five-page letter , not unlike the Rocks and Shoals ( the articles governing the United States Navy ) . ... I do n't know how much my sonny boy told you about his happy childhood in Philadelphia , but we are a very progressive family . I have no objection whatsoever that my son marries a shiksa ( gentile ) but he should not forget he is Jewish . Enclosed are the recipes to make gefilte fish , matzo brie , borsht , gadempta fleysh , tsimmes , etc. when we meet personally , I 'll give you a test . Mainly , you should see to it that Gideon writes to me every week . I hold you responsible . And it would n't hurt a thing if you also correspond with me . I do n't know why Gideon is boycotting Philadelphia . What 's so great about San Francisco ? From Gideon 's mother , a strange , simple message , " How could you do this to your mother ? " Gideon did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short visit as the war was coming to a close . " I 'll go back , " he said , " after my first book is published , and I 'll drive home in a Cadillac . " Before the war ended , an event took place that should have tipped me off that I had married a wild man . Gideon had wangled a transfer from the hospital to duty at a supply depot in San Francisco . At that time the San Francisco Examiner and other Hearst newspapers were pushing for Douglas MacArthur , a soldier , to become supreme commanderin the Pacific , placing him over the Navy and the Marines . A terrible front-page editorial was headlined MARINES DIE NEEDLESSLY and cited MacArthur 's skill at keeping down Army casualties . Of course it did not mention that the Marines were given by far the most dangerous islands to invade . Gideon and some three hundred enlisted Marines paid a visit to the Examiner . When the editor phoned the Shore Patrol for help  --  what do you know , not a single Navy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police arrived , I was told later , Gideon , as spokesman , grabbed the editor by his necktie and said , " The first cop that enters , we 're taking your presses apart . " Result , the Examiner printed a retraction and the rest of the Hearst papers canceled the editorial . I recall this incident because it was theM I T L A PASS 41first time I saw Gideon refuse to back down , a situation that often would recur . A BEAUTIFUL LETTER came from his sister , Molly . Molly wrote that she had waited for this day for so long . She said that many people loved Gideon and he had many good friends and caring relatives , but in a strange way , he was always very much alone . Molly said he desperately needed one person in this world he could call his own , someone to watch over him . And Molly wrote that she loved me because I loved Gideon . Did I love Molly 's baby brother ? Did I love him ! Oh , I know all newlyweds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoured each other . My tightly controlled emotions , disciplined by the untouching hands of my parents , had locked in my ability to show affection as effectively as if contained in a steel box . I never realized how tight it was and how tightly controlled my emotions had become . Love , deeply buried , erupted from me now . We were slightly crazy . We tried everything , read every sex book we could get our hands on . He loved to make me blush when he came across something strange . As soon as we sat down in a restaurant , our hands were under the tablecloth . We 'd duck into alleyways . We 'd make love on the ground in Muir Woods , just a few feet off the main walking path . Some of this does n't sound so wild now , but it was the 1940s , and modesty and whispers ranked over candor . Crazy costumes , mirrors , fantasy . Our fertile minds were seeking all the time . The first Christmas he was out of the service , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloriouslove . And then the dawn came up like thunder from the hoary hills of Oakland cross the bay ! We were mainly living on dreams , youthful ignorance , and veteran 's and unemployment benefits . I thought he would plunge into his novel . He tried for a short time , but finally threw it into a drawer and seldom took it out . Some call it writer 's block . I call it fear . He could n't admit to that . Gideon embarked on a series of gigantic ventures , guaranteed to change the world . Only the world was n't quite ready for him . He formed a bogus Marine veterans ' organization with a membership of five , which enabled him to get a charter from the state , giving him nonprofit status and a number of veterans ' perks . The little bastard went out and rented the San Francisco Opera House to present his new42 LEON URIS J MITLA PASS 43play . He hustled scenery , costumes , got feature articles in the newspapers , received a waiver from the musicians ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way onto radio programs , wrote rave reviews in which he quoted from nonexistent papers in Chicago and New York . Result : seventy-four dollars in the box office and a thousanddollardebt . This shook him up so , he hid away in a fight gym in the tenderloin , played pinball machines every day , all day long , for three months . Next , it was a veterans ' newspaper . This afforded him space to write . He wrote the entire paper , including four columns under different names . He telephoned far into the evenings , hustling ads from local businesses . It took six months for this enterprise to sink and add anotherthousand dollars to our debt . Next came publication of a magazine offering " job opportunities " all over the world . The bunko squad came looking for him . After which he wrote skits for a number of cabarets around North Beach . These were quite funny social commentaries . Unfortunately , the customers liked their entertainment a little more in the raw . I was so damned in love with the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes right up to the day they busted . And then I confronted him with those two magic words , " I 'm preg-nant . " A COUPLE OF fight trainers he had befriended at the gym sent him to a Teamsters local and Gideon became circulation district manager for the San Francisco Call-Bulletin , an afternoon newspaper . He had betweenthirty and forty newspaper boys working for him in home delivery . Between my morning sickness and Gideon having a regular job , we were back in the real world and little by little climbed out of the hole . I had hoped that he would return to writing his novel , but the early disasters had left him gun-shy . He did write constantly , every spare moment , but they were short fiction and nonfiction pieces . He kept between fifteen and twenty of these constantly circulating in the mails from publication to publication . In the next two years , he collected four hundred and twenty-two rejection slips . MOTHER AND I had kept in touch through the occasional letter and phone call . As I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden message that she and the Admiral were going to pay us a visit . Panic city ! Our apartment , such as it was , was scarcely large enough to hold my belly . It had a closet-sized kitchenette , a one-person-at-a-time bathroom , and an all-purpose room with a pull-down Murphy bed . We ate at a card table on fold-up canvas director 's chairs . I had dolled the place up with a couple of my own splashy paintings , some wild color , posters , and gypsy wall hangings . In addition to its collection of saloons , muggers , hookers , and other sleazy characters , the tenderloin had a number of flea market-type shops and used book and record stores . Some polished-up bric-a-brac and filled bookshelves gave the place a kind of kinky charm . Outside our window , life in the raw played out daily human dramas  --  fire trucks shifting gears on our hill rattling our building . . . wife beaters . . . husband beaters .. . drunks passing out in our lobby . . . warring gangs of alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night down our hall . I knew Mom and the Admiral were going to choke when they saw where and how we were living . To my surprise , they did n't seem to give a damn . My own insecurity was quickly replaced by concern over the way my father looked . He was dying . That accounted for the sudden peace visit . He had cancer and I was grateful they had come . Mom told me he had refused all pain medication . " With the pain , " he had told her , " at least I know I 'm alive . " Well , do n't you know that two years of dreading this visit was all for naught . It turned out to be the most wonderful evening I had ever had with them . We blew everything on the meal . The El Globo Restaurant put up a stupendous pot of take-out bouillabaisse and sold us the vino wholesale . The room was bathed in candlelight flickering from Chianti bottles which had grown wax hairdos six inches thick , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves and get loaded . The Admiral and Gideon talked about the invasion of Tarawa like two old war buddies . Gideon had seen it from a Marine 's point of view and researched it further to use in his novel . The Admiral was impressed as hell . " Well , why are n't you working on your book ? " Father asked with a bluntness I knew only too well . " It 's not going to write itself . " I do n't think any of us were ready for Gideon 's answer . " I 'm scared , " he said. 44 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 45 " Scared ? To write ? " Mother asked , with honest innocence . " Everything I 've ever wanted or dreamed of since I was a little boy depends on that book . What if it fails ? Sometimes I think that if I did n't make it , I 'd want to die . I just ca n't go through life being nobody . So , I 'm scared . " The room became terribly quiet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly what you 're saying , " he said . The record ended . Gideon switched it off . The Admiral filled his glass again and spoke , as though to himself . " I 've never known a sane man who was n't afraid . I 've never known a great man who did n't have to conquer his greatest fears . " It came time for them to leave , too soon . Gideon said goodbye and tastefully left the three of us alone . Mother would come back when the baby was due . We all lingered at the door . We had never lingered before over farewells . The Admiral patted my shoulder as though I were a junior officer who had done something commendable . " You are glowing with happiness , Val . I 'm glad . That boy is a good boy . I 've seen a thousand like him , burning inside . He 's picked a rough passage for himself . " " Will he ever do it , Dad ? " " He 'll face that book when he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dad ! " I cried and flung my arms around him . I wanted to tell him that there was so much we had n't ever said to each other . And now he was going to leave ! Forever . Just when we were starting to say hello . The Admiral 's hands remained at his side as I held him . He was awkward in my embrace , not knowing what to do . I longed for him to put his arms around me . He could n't . Yet I realized that he understood everything . And I suppose he did love me , in his own way . I 'm glad the Admiral lived long enough to see Roxanne born . He was in a wheelchair then . There was n't much left of him . When they put her into his arms , he held her quite tenderly for a long time . . . and he looked at me and smiled . . . as though he had been holding me . GLORY , GLORY , HALLELUJAH ! And yet another easy monthly paymentbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own sofa , a Monkey Ward fridge , and a secondhand Model A Ford , for which we paid eighty dollars cold hard cash . Now comes the Great Valerie Santini balancing act ! Do we go for dishes , towels , silver , and linens ? ORGideon longed for one of those new long-playing record machines . HOWEVERRoxy needed a ballet costume . ANDIf we could only get six more months out of the front tires . If it all went according to schedule , we would have everything we ever wanted and it would be all paid off in three hundred and forty-five years , down considerably from the last accounting of four hundred and six years . We were making headway . I hid money so that every week we had enough left over for a movie and a Chinese or El Globo dinner . On payday I 'd hide another two dollars in nickels and dimes around the apartment for my own clothing fund and mad money . Gideon 's job paid pretty well , seventy-five dollars a week . Otherwise it was rotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how terrible his day had been . Being poor was a new and growing experience for me . What I had n't realized was that you could be poor but deliriously happy at the same time . Every night when I heard him take the stairs three steps at a time I 'd shiver a little bit . We 'd meet in the doorway or out in the hall and he would hold me like we had n't seen each other for weeks . As soon as the apartment door was closed , he 'd feel my backside or wherever he could get with his hand under my dress ( I did n't make it too difficult for him ) . In a few minutes Roxy would have him pinned down on the floor , fishing through his pockets for her prize . I put Roxy to bed early . She was coming down with the sniffles . Besides , tonight was going to be a super special time . Mom and Dad were reading The Kinsey Report on human sexuality and were trying out something a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people were already into . There was a little something else going on too . I skipped a period every now and again and usually it was n't cause for alarm . Candlelight on the card table . La Boheme on the record player . I 've wanted it back so many times , Gideon . Where did it go ? Jesus , we were so happy . I served him wearing a knockout front-button sweater . He stared at me so adoringly , I blushed . For a long time I 'd wondered why Gideon married me . I was on the tall side , blond , with a terrific pair of tits . I knew it made him feel good when I was at his side . He was proud of me , my college education , my old man being an Admiral . Through me , Gid-46 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 47eon was thumbing his nose at something in his childhood . He would n't talk about it , just as he would n't talk about the war . We talked about everything else . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very funny guy when he got a little tipsy and he knew something about everything going on in the world . A lot of times we 'd talk without words . He 'd put his arm about my shoulder and lay my head on his chest and we 'd listen to those secondhand records and sip vino . " You 've been looking awfully beautiful lately , Val . " He unbuttoned the sweater front and did all those nice sweet things to my breasts .. . " We pregnant ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Hey , how about that ! I would n't mind another little girl . " " How come ? " " Little boys have to be little men the minute they 're born . The pressureis on for them to be tough  --  do n't cry  --  look how strong he ishe'llbe a hockey player , that one . " " But I want your son . " " But I do n't want my son to go to war , " he said . And I knew this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinking , honey . I can take a few brush-up art courses . You know , I really do n't have that many credits left to get my teacher 's certificate , " I said . " There 's a ten-dollar pay raise coming and I 'm getting an extra fiver a week as the union shop steward . Let 's try it this way for the time being . " Roxanne ran a little temp and had a bad dream . I took her to bed with me and Gideon sacked out on our paid-for couch . During the night when she was restless and woke me I could see Gideon , his eyes open staring at us , so filled with love . " Hi , " I said . " Hi , " he answered . " Squeeze in with us , honey , " I told him . I pushed my backside against his tummy and his arm went around the both of us . When Roxy 's fever dropped , I wished for an endless night . G I D E O N AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the Golden Gate Bridge , even though it meant a long bus ride tothe city . We would spend his days off driving around Math ' , fantasizing that our dream house would appear . Mill Valley was a sweet , cuddly little town with redwood stands , woodsy trails , running brooks , zillions of flowers , and an artsy village center . Henry Perkins was a real estate salesman who worked the poor side of the tracks . He had long deduced from our Model A that we were n't going into the high-rent district . The house Mr. Perkins found for us was actually an abandoned weekendcottage and , as we say in the trade , needed a bit of work by a handyman . But dammit , it had a spacious yard with a big madrona tree and a front porch meant for a swing and the living room had a fireplace and there were really nice schools within walking distance and . . . the price was right . " Seven thousand four hundred dollars , " Mr. Perkins said , consulting his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This little beauty has a full G.I. loan . Nothing down and about a hundred bucks closing costs . " " How much are the monthly payments ? " " On a 4 percent loan it comes to . . . let 's see . Forty-one dollars and six cents a month , principal , interest , and insurance . " Our hearts were in our throats . We had a hundred and four dollars in the bank . What mistakes Gideon did n't make as a carpenter , he made as a gardener , a painter , a plumber , and a bricklayer . But we attacked our little witch 's cottage until my belly got in the way , and by the time Penelope was born we had a warm , cozy , tiny piece of the world with a garden filled with roses . GIDEON HATED his job . I mean , he hated it with a passion . Home delivery in newspaper parlance conjures up a nice , clean-cut , all-Americanimage of yapping dogs and picket fences and smiles on the faces of satisfied subscribers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classic apple-pie road from rags to riches . It was a shit job . There was an ugly circulation war among the four San Francisco newspapers . The game was rigged so that the newspaper boys got screwed right , left , and center . District managers like Gideon came under unbearable pressure from48 LEON URISan unsavory circulation department on the one side and the need to protect their paperboys on the other . His department floated on antacids and ulcer medication . Someone had a heart attack every six weeks . Gideon and some of the other district managers became just as sleazy fighting the paper and seeing to it their boys did n't suffer losses . To make matters worse , the men elected Gideon as the union shop steward so he had every other district manager 's misery to contend with as well as his own . Winters were wet in San Francisco , but neither paperboys nor papers came waterproofed . The department became such a meat grinder that out of forty district managers , Gideon was third in seniority in a few short years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a wildcat walkout was being planned . This could mean bare-knuckle time , because the paper kept a lot of ex-fighters and toughs around to deal with such unrest . As a ringleader of the " agitators , " Gideon was transferred to a fully certified skid row , a district of poor blacks , poorer Hispanics , winos , prostitutes , several save-your-soul missions , V.D. clinics , and five candystorerobberies a night . " Hi , Mom ! " " Hello , Val . I just set my bags down . Can you make it for cocktails at six in the Garden Court ? Gideon can join us for dinner when he gets off work . " Mother and I had grown close , or at least as close as we were able . She adored Penny and Roxy , and Gideon never failed to bring a twinkle to her eye . Scotch is one of the unsung perks that comes with motherhood . Lovely stuff . Over drinks in the Garden Court , Mom and I made plans for the girls to spend a month with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the last couple of weeks . Mother was too elegant to come out with the forbidden subject , so I did . " He does n't write anymore . When we first moved to Mill Valley he did some short pieces . The job has just taken all the starch out of him . To say nothing of the rejections . Oh God , I hate rejections . They are death sentences . How many death sentences can a man take ? " " Do you think he 's done with it forever ? " " Right now I do . He 'd have to find another job . Maybe if he couldMITLA PASS 49get something in Marin , he would start writing again . As for me , I 've decided to go back to school and pick up my credits as soon as we have Penny in kindergarten . Between the two of us , we can become comfortable in time . " Mom grew uncharacteristically quiet and managed a sad smile . " What 's on your mind , Mom ? " " Somewhere along the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Admiral did n't , but on the other hand he did n't try to take a trip to the moon alone . Somehow I thought Gideon was going to make it . " " We 're still very much in love . Sooner or later he 'll get his job situationsquared away . Maybe he 'll try again . " " The longer he waits , the tougher it becomes . And what if he realizes he 'll never be a writer ? " " Maybe Gideon got in over his head . Anyone who goes into writing has to find out somewhere along the line , he 's either naive or insane . It 's not going to be the end of our life . " ONE MORE San Francisco winter and Gideon changed . A lot of his cockiness and bravado had turned into sulkiness . The fire in him was dying out and he was trying to find the way to cope with his defeat and still keep going . One night he was packed home between a couple of his buddies , pissy-assed drunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new phase of our marriage , or was the old Marine just bidding fond adieu to writing ? We did not communicate for a week , except through the girls . On his day off , he came into the kitchen sheepishly lugging his typewriter . " I want a new typewriter , " he said . " How much can we swing ? " Pencil went to paper . Jesus , there was a dress I wanted so badly  --  I 'd saved thirty dollars in hidden nickels and dimes . We were still paying off the washing machine . " Three dollars , " I said . Gideon got six dollars a week allowance . He 'd cut it to five . The same day he took the Underwood to an office supply store in San Rafael . It was so old it had a right-hand carriage throw . " This is the down payment . I can afford five bucks a month . Can I get a new machine ? " " I 've got some real nice reconditioned models . . . " " I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . I 'll throw in an autographed copy when it 's finished . " " I do n't get rich from these kind of deals , buddy . " 50 LEON URIS " Yes or no ? " " You 're serious about this writing . I never sold a machine to a writer before . " " You 're fucking A I 'm serious . Marine 's honor . " Gideon had said the magic words . The store owner was an ex-Marine . They stick together like Jews . Gideon came home with a Smith-Corona , unlocked the manuscript drawer , and took out the first pages of Of Men in Battle . WHAT HAPPENED to my man in the next three years , I would n't have wished on a dog . Gideon arrived home about eight at night and he wrote in a little attic alcove until two or three in the morning . The alcove held a card table and the typewriter . It was situated next to a small bedroom belonging to the girls . His typing became their lullaby . He was usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps alone . I had to undress him . On his day off , he 'd work at the typewriter for seventeen or eighteen straight hours . And so it came to pass that one night he wrote THE END and then he dedicated the manuscript to his " long-suffering wife " and the two of us got stiffed and agonized through a monumental hangover . Next came the prelude to hell . Writer 's death . Rejection . Every trip to the post office box , you enter with fear in the throat , in the chest . Days and weeks and months go by and then  --  POW ! . . . that terrible little half sheet mimeographed form arrives saying " This does n't meet our current publishing needs . " Most of the time the signature is so blurred you ca n't decipher it , other times there is no signature at all , just the form . No word of encouragement , no compliment , no hope . No explanation . Writing a personal letter apparently would mean no time for an editor to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon 's was " junk mail , " the " sludge pile . " Occasionally someone wrote a smart-assed heartless note : " This is perhaps the worst manuscript ever produced in the English language , " or " Try a nice trade , like plumbing . " I got sick of seeing Gideon being beaten like this . He became too numbed for tears , but I did n't . Our lives were being savaged by nameless , faceless bastards . Well . . . enough winters and springs and summersand autumns pass and somewhere along the line , if you are persistent , you pick up a friend or two . The West Coast editor of Summerfield House , Donald Howard , thought enough of the book to send it to New York with the recommendation , " I know it needs a lot of work but IM I T L A PASS 51have a hunch about this writer and would like to spend the time helping him clean up this manuscript . " To which the publisher answered , " Forget it . It would take two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got better things to do . " Obviously Howard did n't have clout , but he did have mercy and called Gideon to his office . Gideon was down . I mean really down . His eyes showed constant pain and sorrow . " I think I can show you a few things that will help this manuscript , " Donald Howard told him . So Gideon squandered our vacation to go over to San Francisco every day for an hour or so and he and Donald went through the manuscript sentence by sentence . It was filled with overwriting , loose ends , failed characterizations , bad construction . The manuscript began to look like a herd of elephants had crapped on it . But Howard insisted the good far outweighed the bad . Gideon had an inborn , God-given talent for dialogue , for power and drive , and a sense of rhythm and timing and mostly  --  an enormous love of humanity . " The question is , " Howard said , " do you have the balls to write it over , one more time ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed the girls , ate at the typewriter , and was put to bed by me . And then came the rejections again ... six more of themWHEN G I D E O N got off the bus and saw my face , he knew instantly . " There 's been an accident . Penelope is in the hospital . " Mom held us together . Our little girl lay in a coma for two weeks , fighting for her life . I can not write , or even think about it . There is no pain to compare , no fear to equal . We were tough and brave for each other . . . but Mom held us together . . . and my guilt nearly drove me insane . Days and nights ran together . . . that awful hospital corridor .. . the grim face of the doctor . . . all those tubes and bandages and monitors . . . her beautiful little face one huge bruise . . . no flutter of recognition . . . oh God , Penny , speak to Mommy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her running into the street . . . " Penny ! The bus ! " Another midnight . . . I staggered to the coffee machine numbed , another setback . Across the hall was the chapel and the door was ajar . I sat down on the rear bench . . . Gideon was near the altar , unaware of my presence . . . I 'd never52 LEON URISseen him in a church or a synagogue . . . he did n't think much of religion .. . " God ! " he said with a voice so anguished I could scarcely recognize it . " I do n't know if you 're there . I do n't know if you 've ever been there ... I was told when I was a kid not to ask for favors from God .. . only to ask for strength and wisdom . . . .

I 'll work at that fucking newspaper the rest of my life and I wo n't complain , okay ? I swear I 'll never complain about not becoming a writer . . . man , that 's all I can give you . Please do n't take my baby ... " IT TOOK a long , long time and many nights of tears and dread , but Penelope fought through it . She was her father 's daughter . One day , almost to the year , Penny and Roxy and I waited for Gideon at the busstop . Penny handed him a telegram . FORGIVE DELAY .

Gideon coped with it all quite easily , like an old friend he 'd been waiting for . He quit the newspaper with a lovely touch of understated dignity . The fellows at work were terribly proud to see one of their own leave by the front door and not have to be carried out feet first . They gave him a beautiful suitcase , a dictionary , and ( so I heard ) a raunchy stag party . His newspaperboys cried openly . They chipped in and bought him a rather expensive butane cigarette lighter and told him they were sorry they did n't have a nickel left over for the card . When he stopped smoking , he continued to carry the lighter with him , always . Oh , he had a few blowouts , to be sure , and there were a couple of times I had to send the Marines out looking for him , but by and large I felt he would ease into his new status comfortably and certainly nothing was going to change between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prolonged celebration , but the guy had worked so long andMITLA PASS 53so hard for it , I decided to leave it alone . I talked it over with Mother , who 'd had more than a little experience of her own . She 'd come to love Gideon and did n't think it was a good time to clip his wings . Anyhow , I knew Gideon would always find his way home . I was n't entirely happy with the plans for his second novel . Gideon had become intrigued with the people who inhabited San Francisco 's tenderloin and had done a number of short character sketches which he wanted to build into a novel . He enjoyed hanging out in the crummiest bars , with the fight crowd , or getting into a little card game with the small-time hoods , and listening to the hookers ' tales of woe . It was n't exactly my cup of tea , but I decided to keep my peace and let him work it out with his editor . I did n't cotton to his idea of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his research , and pretty much decided that this would be where I would draw the line . Maybe , by the time he had to make a decision , he would have changed his mind . As for me , Valerie Zadok wanted peace , a nicer home in the hills of Sausalito overlooking the Bay and San Francisco . Maybe we could afforda sailboat . We always had one when I was growing up in Coronado . And , up in the loft , Gideon would be pecking away at his typewriter . San Francisco venerated writers . We would be a big new part of the scene . What wonderful things lay ahead . Maybe I 'd even pick up the paintbrush again and try my hand at a few canvases . Well , so much for pipe dreams . The first rude awakening came a few months later when he received the galleys of his book from the publisherto make corrections . Reaves Brothers Publishers was an old-line , medium-sized house which had been dominated for three decades by the powerful and " legendary " Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his iron grip , and with no heir apparent the company broke up into warring factions . The editor-in-chief , Jed Bascomb III , was a Boston type who had been brought in by the old man to fill the role as number one gofer . When the old man 's health deteriorated , J. Bascomb III got delusions of grandeur . However , he proved more of a manipulator than a man of any literary integrity . Gideon 's Of Men in Battle was apparently a majorcog in Bascomb 's scheme to make a name for himself . Gideon had written the novel in a breezy and whimsical style all his own . He inserted a first-person narrator who jumped in and out of the story at odd moments . It was quite out of the ordinary and also quite daring . J. III obviously did n't want to take a chance and , without54 LEON URIS consulting Gideon , simply lifted the narrator out of the novel . The first Gideon knew about it was when the galleys arrived . J. III MUST have felt pretty certain of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubted if Gideon would give him any problems . He had picked on the wrong Jew . We were so starved for success and now we could taste it , feel it , smell it . I prayed Gideon would n't upset the cart at this stage . I do n't know who Gideon communicated with , but after two days of pondering without sleep , he came into the kitchen with blood in his eyes . " It 's no use , Val . I ca n't do it . I 'm not going to release the galleys until they agree to change the book back to the way I wrote it . " God ! I thought I 'd drop dead , right there , on the spot ! I personally could n't see that it made that much difference . Moreover , the people in New York certainly had more experience in these matters than Gideon . Worst of all , what if they refused to publish ? All the punch-drunk nights , all the rejections , all the years of struggle and fear , down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their way , " I said shakily . " Not you too , Val . " " Do n't make me a traitor , Gideon . Honey , they 're just trying to improve the book . " " I do n't believe you , Val . " " And I do n't believe you . You 're just looking for a fight . " " If they 're too stupid to understand what I 'm trying to do  --  " " Shut up for once ! There are other people involved in this . Maybethat 's why this damned thing has been rejected fifteen times . Maybeonce , just once , they know better than you . " " I ca n't believe that you do n't understand ! " " I understand , Gideon . I understand . I peeled your clothing off every night . For your sainted information , we have just about spent the thou- sand-dollar advance and you 've quit your job against everyone 's advice . I have something to say about this book . My blood is in it too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me and you have n't got idea one what a writer is supposed to be . " " Take that lily-white banner and shove it up your ass , " I screamed . " We ca n't eat ideals . . . Look . . . look . . . let 's cool down . Honey , nobody 's going to know if they change it . " " I 'll know , " he cried , poking his thumb into his chest . " They 've put me at the crossroads . They want me to go left , I want to go right . " " But do n't you see  --  when you 're stronger , when you 're established , you can retrace your steps and go any way you want . " " Val , you 're crazy , baby . Once you compromise , you can never get it back . You 've got to put your foot down and make your fight when you 're hungry . Once you 're fat , you 'll always do as they say . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those God-damned nights . . . " I just bawled . " Oh shit . . . shit , shit , shit . " I felt his hand on my shoulder . " Please , honey . " " I ca n't , Val , " he said . " I  --  uh  --  uh  --  I 'll go down to the union next week and see about getting back on one of the newspapers . Do n't .. . do n't worry about me . . . I 've got to walk it off for a few days .. . I 'll be back . I wish I could explain what being a writer means to me . " Gideon did n't have to explain . We 'd live it out , bloody battle by bloody battle . He sent Bascomb a telegram refusing to release the galleys , left the house , and disappeared for three days . " MOMMY ! Daddy 's back ! " Lord , he looked like he 'd been in a flophouse on skid row . I do n't know how I felt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like bitting him over the head with a chair . " Union 's going to put me on the Chronicle , " he said . " I 'll be driving a truck temporarily . No problem getting back on . Just lose a little senior-ity . " " You do n't have to , " I said . " The publisher has agreed to your de-mands . " MARTIN R E A V E S died before Of Men in Battle was published . The house was ripped to pieces . J. Bascomb III replaced publishing skill with cunning , candor with deceit . Without a program , no one knew who was talking to whom . Gideon really needed someone now , to guide him through the coming months and give him some direction for his second novel . Of Men in Battle had built a sizable advance sale to the booksellers and was to become the first novel in history to be sold with a moneybackguarantee . Gideon had left the newspaper with an understanding we would get six hundred dollars a month from the publisher in ad-56 L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could begin the tenderloin novel and we could stay afloat until regular royalty checks caught up with us . The money failed to come in , even though the book went back for a third printing before publication . So here was Gideon with a book about to go onto the bestseller list and we had to take a second mortgage on the house . When a Hollywood sale and screenplay were offered by Pacific Studios , we grabbed it in order not to sink . I do n't know the answer . If his publisher had kept his word , Gideon might have passed up the screenplay job and started The Tenderloin . I did n't know and neither did he . It had become a matter of survival and the studio salary of seven hundred dollars a week seemed like the end of the rainbow . For me , my dream of tranquillity was shattered , forever . I was locked in with a warrior . GIDEONSan Francisco Bay Area , 1953FROM THE TIME I was a little guy I rehearsed the moments of future glory a thousand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon Zadok , would be ready . During the dark years , the fantasy of reaching the top had become an overwhelming driving force that kept me going . Now , it began to happen . Dream after dream came true . Val enjoyed some of it  --  the TV shows , the newspaper articles , the good reviews , the recognition and attention . For the first time , I saw a completely differentside of her . She was very uncomfortable with the spotlight on her . She was n't getting the kicks I was getting . For years , when I was working on the newspaper and writing in the attic in Mill Valley , I would get to a radio every day and listen to the Mary Margaret McBride show . She was a pleasant little fat lady who broadcast from her flat on Central Park South in New York and interviewedan author a day who was having a new book published . When I was summoned to her show , I was ready . I was ready for my suite at the writer 's mecca , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , but what the hell . I was ready when I was invited to lunch at their famed Round Table , graced by the literary lights of the day . Halfway through the meal I realized these assholes took their one-upmanship seriously . The New Yorker crowd . Would-be Oscar Wildes . I stopped the show with a couple of blunt , crude remarks to watch them gag and turn pale . Val did n't catch the drift of my humor at all . In fact , she was furious with me. 58 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 59 " I suppose you think your vulgar Marine gutter talk was amusing . " " Oh , for Christ sake , Val . Do n't you see what a bunch of fakes they are ? The whole goddam gang of them have n't written anything for ten years . Who in the hell are they to dictate public taste ? " " You had a chip on your shoulder the minute you entered New York . " " This scene runs on too much bullshit . Look at the bullshit at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner himself , in person , usheringus past the peasants into the chummy Cub Room reserved for the hotsy-totsy elite . The publisher picked up a tab of over sixty dollars  --  over sixty dollars . For what ? Bullshit . " " Relax , buddy , enjoy , " she said . " You 've made it . Stop waving a red flag . Everyone knows G. Zadok is n't a member of the establishment . Take a cold shower . " Maybe Val was right . I 'm nice to most people . I just do n't like phonies . I was just mixed up . I wanted to be me but I was having difficulty finding out who me was . I could n't hang out around the newspaper and suck on beers at the corner bar anymore . My old buddies looked at me differently these days . Like I was some kind of tin Jesus , or something . Are guys like J. III my new life ? Fight/ , do n't fight . I do n't know how I 'm supposed to act . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll find out how tough you are soon enough . So , relax . " " Yeah , I guess I 'd better . " " How about you and me taking a walk up Fifth Avenue to look for the real Gideon Zadok ? " she said . " The real Zadok 's in this room with you , baby , and he wants to put you flat on that bed . " " You crazy guy , " she said , taking my kisses . I stroked her hair later and kissed her a lot and found myself looking out of the window down on Forty-fourth street . It was hysterical down there . " Getting the first book accepted is like getting shot out of a cannon . I guess water has to find its own level . " She sat up in the bed . I never got tired of looking at her . " You 'll be okay , " she said . " You 're really a nice guy . " " There 's a pile of good plays on here . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed all those things I thought I was ready for : the interview with Variety , the 50,000-watt clear-channel station , the bow on " The Ed Sullivan Show , " the blurb in Winchell 's column . Be graceful , be decent . Remember , buddy , none of it means a damn if anything is wrong with Val or Penny or Boxy . The war had been over for nearly a decade and I had n't returned to Baltimore . Now I was ready . Kid 's stuff , I know , but I rented the biggest , blackest Caddy convertible and drove down for the long-delayedfamily reunion . When I parked it in front of my sister Molly 's house , it took up half the street . All the kids gathered around it and gawked and the neighbors tried to steal a glimpse of me . I went up to them and gave them hugs and they blushed and stammered . Yeah , it was nice and everyone enjoyed it . The champ was home ! The American dream lives ! In Look magazine there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading Of Men in Battle all in a pretty row . And an A.P . wirephoto of the heiress Barbara Hutton getting off the plane in Vegas to get another divorce , with a copy under her arm , and one of Floyd Patterson reading it on the night before he creamed HurricaneJackson . There was my first autographing party at Stationers Book Store in San Diego . San Diego . Of the early moments of the early days of the victory tour , this was the answer to my wildest dream . I 'd done my boot camp in Dago . Back then I was a kid , seventeen , and war had just broken out . I had enlisted in the Corps . It was in Dago that the writer 's dream took on first reality and life . I now had something to say to the world . I 'd walk Broadway past the Y and the sleaze joints and get pissed on a fake I.D . card . And in Dago I had my first lay by a whore . I 'd get on the ferry to Coronado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty was about up and I 'd dream of the story I 'd tell someday . The El Cortez Hotel crowned a small hill near Broadway . I 'd look up to it , a symbol of rank and affluence , and I 'd say to myself , " someday . " Dago was a war-hardened town that had sent off hundreds of thousands of boys to do battle in the Pacific . Now , over a decade later , it stopped for a moment and bowed to Gideon Zadok , Private , USMC . The day before the autographing party , I entered the Marine Corps base and was whisked to the commanding general 's office and I stood next to him while the graduating recruit battalion passed in review . " We 're proud of you , Marine , " he said to me . Sounds like the old boys ' club stuff , I know . Schlocky . Corny as hell . But I 'd written a new and different kind of war book . Most of the war novels had expressed deep hatred for America and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't hate the men I fought it with . I60 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 61loved them and I respected my officers and I knew why I was fighting . I was glad the Corps was proud of me . Val and I had left the girls in Coronado with their grandmother and we took a suite at the El Cortez . We had dinner in the Skyroom restaurantwith all of Dago and all of her ships and planes and lights spread below . . . and for the moment , I was king of the hill . " You look so pensive , honey , " Val said . " Lot of things running through my head , " I answered . Later that night , we made some of the randiest love of our marriage . It started in the cocktail lounge . Val came in first and took a table by herself . In a service town like Dago , drinks start appearing like magic when a single lady enters a bar . She rejected them with thanks . Enter great new American novelist looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Any action ? " I asked . " Little slow tonight , " he said . I nodded toward Val . " She alone ? " " She 's not accepting . " " What 's she drinking ? " " Whiskey sour . " " Fix me up one . " " I think you 're wasting your money . " As I sidled over to her , she crossed her legs enticingly . " Hi . Your drink , " I said . She looked me up and down . " Thanks , but no thanks . You 're a little short for my taste . " " I 'm tall in the saddle , " I said , taking a seat opposite her . ( Tonight Val was the wife of a Navy flier out in the Pacific , somewhere . ) " Writer , huh ? " " Author . One of the best . " " If truth be known , I 've already turned a trick here tonight . He did n't do me much good . " And so forth and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my suite two drinks later , the railbirds at the bar gawked and the bartender gave me a V for victory sign . Nothing , fellows , really nothing . It was two in the morning . I could n't sleep . Val flicked on the bed lamp . " Honey , you 're dressed . " " I 've got to get some air , " I said . " Everything okay ? " " I 'm just a little on edge about tomorrow . I wo n't be out long . " I walked down the hill toward Broadway and stopped in front of Stationers Book Store . The window held several dozen copies of Of Men in Battle , along with a blowup photograph of me  --  my first author 's photo , pipe , patches on the elbow of a corduroy jacket , the whole thing . Meet the Author , Autographing Party , Friday at 2 P.M.Was I really standing there ! So much flooded through me . The old memory of Broadway came alive and the street was filled with hundreds of swabbies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddies pretending they were tough and having fun . Seventeen years old , a long way from home , and all the world out there ahead of me . Meet the Author . What beautiful words . . . meet the author . . . you do n't know me , do you ? I was one of those bewildered kids sick to the stomach from too many Singapore slings . It was empty . Not a soul around . My books in the window . I started to cry . " Looking for company , mister ? " It was Val . She 'd thrown on a dress and coat and followed me from the hotel . A squad car pulled up and one of the cops jumped out . " What 's going on ? " Before I could answer , he saw my photo in the window . " Hey ! That 's you ! " " Jesus ! Hey , Sean . It 's the author ! Gideon Zadok . We heard you over the radio this evening . This broad bothering you ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a Marine . He would n't hear of us walking back up the hill . We had a couple of drinks with them in the old Mexican section and they drove us back to the El Cortez . I took their names and addressesand said I 'd send them books . Although the evening ended up with laughs , there was a disturbing undertone . The instant Val had broken my reverie before the store window , I felt put upon . I wanted to be alone , dammit , alone with my buddies . I wanted Pedro to be proud of me now . Why was I so ticked ? Val and I had shared everything . Or had we ? I 'd never told her about Pedro . April 10 , 1953 My Son ! My Son ! The first copy of your novel was received by me with its beauti-62 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 63ful inscription . Confidentially , I do n't like , too much , the colors on the cover . And for why were they trying to hide your name ? Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the time you were a little boy I helped you grow , encouraged you and now the fruits of our labors have been realized . My son the writer ! And I , a humble paperhanger , a celebrityin my own right . I did not have any chance in my life to achieve in the arts , so you will realize for me , all my dreams . Every night now we have over to our humble apartment , friends , filled with good wishes . " How will Gideon react when he is famous and wealthy ? " Some would like to believe that Gideon will become like all other celebrities , go live in luxury , forget the little man and soon his writing will decline in quality and he will adapt his writings to the taste of the less literary minded . But we the majority categorically defeated that school of thought . We the majority are convinced that fame and riches will never degenerate Gideon , because Gideon Zadok the writer is bigger in heart and mind than money and the gilded objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the people he came from . My wife , Lena , your stepmother , who loves you as her own son , says she is afraid she will have to buy a ticket and stand in line to see you and that her borsht and knishes will not be good enough for you to eat . So son , you should reassure her by return letter and tell her you plan to come with the family immediately to Philadelphiaand put her , and everyone else 's fears to rest . You still like borsht and knishes ? No ? And also , son , you should always mentionher in your letters as she is sensitive . Say something personal and nice . Lena says we should have made a child together so we could have a genius of our own . And what do you have against Philadelphia ? Why are you avoiding ? You will forgive in advance a few observations and advice from me . Although the circumstances of life kept me from being a writer , I am still considered an educated and literate man . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stay away from red baiting . Try to make your next book more profound , with deeper thinkingand more meaningful characters . Your plans to write a book about fighters and prostitutes frankly does n't sit too well with me . You should be thinking more in terms of Jewish themes and themes of the struggles of the working class . Do n't make so much dirty dialogue . It is untasteful . I have many , many , many more criticisms of which I will advise you in my forthcoming letters , for only through criticism will you grow . You will have thousands of fans in Philadelphia . I wish you would n't snub so much this town . Perhaps you will even consider moving to Philadelphia as it is more of a literary and cultural center than so-called San Francisco and God forbid you stay in Los Angeles , a notorious center of anti-Semitism . I have given your address to a number of relatives now desirous of making your personal acquaintance , although many of them snubbed me for years . I hold no grudges . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious subject . There is a feeling among intellectualsthat once a writer makes his debut in Hollywood , his literary abilities , his ambition to write important subjects becomes negligible , that he is degraded , that he gives up his talent , his name , for what ? Money ? Glamour ? And soon his name is forgotten once the glitter of gold and diamonds is before his eyes . Of course , Hollywoodhas the genius to produce good artistic and educational pictures , but the ignorant masses instead prefer sexy shmattes . And lastly , being in Hollywood does n't mean you must not write to me every week . And now that Valerie is a woman of leisure , she should also write more regularly . It is the fourth commandmentthat she should write . She believes in the ten commandments , does n't she ? Your loving father , NathanP.S . My love also to the girls . I hope they do n't become corrupted by the glitter of Hollywood . Otherwise I and Lena are fine , with the usual aches and pains of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Studios , I wanted the comfort of knowing I would return to writing my second novel . I sent an outline and the first two chapters of The Tenderloin to J. Bascomb III and asked for a contract . I found out that J. III did n't trust his own judgment . He edited by round table and his reply consisted of the reportsof five editors .. . " A one-shot novelist . " 64 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 65 " We 'd be better off letting our option lapse . " " A sad commentary from someone starting so promising a career . " " Zadok is obviously turning into a junk writer . " " He 'll never be heard from again . " J. III wrote that despite these reports , he would publish The Tenderloinanyhow , when it was finished , because anything of mine would do fairly well after my first novel . This was a pretty crude way for an editor-in-chief to behave , but he wanted to put me down for " going Hollywood " and he also wanted to be certain I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . He was either out to lunch or in conference or otherwise engaged , so I wrote him that I wanted out of Reaves Brothers , in my best Marine language . Val was outraged . " They 'll know about your letter all up and down Madison Avenue . Have n't we had enough trouble finding a publisher ? " " You 're asking me to stay with those sons of bitches after what they think of my new work ! " God damn , there were some things that Val just did n't understand about me . Compromise , back down , keep quiet . God damn , Val ! Do n't you ever get mad at anyone but me ? I put out a call for a literary agent , not really knowing one from another . I ca n't say why I settled on F. Todd Wallace . He had a veddy/ veddy uptown manner and represented some good authors . He reminded me of those jerks at the Algonquin Round Table , but he obviously was one of them and knew his way around the literary scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Rock of Gibraltar . " Ca n't go wrong with old Todd . " As time unfolded I might as well have been represented by the Mother Superior at a Carmelite nunnery . Anyhow , I 'd never have to deal with J. III or that bloody house again . I left ahead of Val and the girls , to get set up at the studio and find a place for us to live . It was on a sour note . Things I always believed that Val would understand automatically  --  she did n't understand at all . Hollywood , 1954  --  1956THE ACTUAL FILM DEAL on Of Men in Battle had been made by my Hollywood literary agent , Sal Sensibar . From our first meeting , I realized Sal was a back stabber who might well have been in the white slave traffic if he had n't been a literary agent . Sal had terminal cases of diarrhea of the mouth and megalomania . Nevertheless , I liked him . We came from the same side of the tracks , way back when . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would always find work for me . He liked things , lots of things , things with big engines , things that sparkled , furry things to drape on his tawdry wife and tawdry girlfriends , huge things to swim in . When Sal dined me at Chasen 's and Scandia , back to back , I knew I was the bright new boy in town . The restaurant prices automatically signaled the value of the writer . Advice was doled out in huge globs . Some of it was even worth listening to . Sal gave it to me straight . The studios usually pacified the author with four to six weeks ' work as a little icing on the cake in order to get his general ideas , nothing more . Few producers were ever serious about letting a novelist complete his own screenplay . " Remember , Gideon , what you have written is preserved forever between the covers of a book . " " Sal , I 'm going to do this screenplay . " " I 'm not saying you 're not , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might buy a book for any number of reasons  --  as a star vehicle , because a director likes it , for its title value , or just as a rough outline for a film . They own it . You sold the rights to them . They 're not obliged to make a faithful rendition . " " Why are you telling me this ? " " I like you , Gideon . Get through this alive and we 'll both make a lot of money together . But do n't go in there with any farcockta ideas of grandeur . " THE FIRST DAY at Pacific was awesome ! I had passed through the gates of a place of glamour and power second only to the White House . I was assigned to an old-time staff producer , Kurt von Dortann , who had come over during the Lubitsch era when monocled Germans were all the rage . Von Dortann had some great early successes . In a weak moment , after a big hit , the studio chief , Stanley Gold , gave him an ironclad tenyearcontract worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When von Dortann started to bomb with one picture after another , Gold tried every which way to get rid of him . Von Dortann hung in there through public insults , humiliations , and degradations . Gold did66 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 67everything but kick his shins and slap his face . Von Dortann would merely smile and bow crisply and pick up his paycheck . What I met was a rag of a man , completely broken , in a haze of memories . Von Dortann still ripped around in a Porsche , but his old Spanish-style estate in Tarzana was like a haunted house , where he would get into his cups every night and bemoan the wife and daughter who had abandoned him . On weekends the place looked like a hookers ' convention . At our first meeting von Dortann confirmed Saes warning that I was there for a long walk off a short pier . " No hurry . Do n't rush , " he assured me . " Just write a treatment of what you think should go from the book into the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullshit , little Eva . I was ready . Not that I was planning a Hollywood career , but after a lifetime in cheap sneakers the money , the office , the secretary , the new car , the power , the beautiful little home I was able to lease were like a stroll on the glory road . You know what the hell it 's like taking your wife into a dress shop on Rodeo Drive and peeling off eighty dollars , cold cash , and not feel like you 've been hit in the stomach ? And not have to say for the first time in your life , " How much is this going to cost ? " I knew all about this place being a writers ' graveyard when I came . But dammit , as a poor boy , I would n't have been human if I did n't think I 'd died and gone to heaven . So , from day one , excuse me for repeating , I was ready . " Can I get a film run for me ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see High Noon and I want the final script as well . " High Noon , for me , was the ultimate motion picture . It had a perfect , miraculous blend of script , acting , direction , music , art , sound , every element of film . As I watched the picture , I read the script simultane- ously . Every few minutes I 'd signal for the projectionist to stop and I 'd dictate to my secretary the type of shot , what the camera was doing , how the film was scored and cut , sound effects , stunts . I broke it down almost frame by frame . That was my entire schooling on film writing . I knocked off a two-page treatment in twenty minutes and then went immediately into a first-draft screenplay . Von Dortann did n't ask to see pages for the four weeks of my employment contract . When he did , I handed him a **26;16200;TOOLONG screenplay . He gaped in dis- belief . Most of the other writers dragged ass to prolong their weekly salaries . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , I swim . In the history of Pacific Studios they had never seen a novel of this size and scope turned into a screenplay so fast . The golden moment arrived ! I was summoned to the office of the head of the studio and its founder , the almighty Colonel Stanley Gold . My secretary cleaned some spots off my shirt and borrowed a necktie and jacket for me . The opulence of Gold 's office was staggering . The array of " yes " men seemed like something out of a really bad movie . Gold had earned his rank during the war when patriotic fever swept the town . " Find out what rank they gave Zanuck and Jack Warner . " Thus , Colonel Gold . " Hell of a piece of work , Zadok . We 'd like you to carry on with a second-draft screenplay . " Bingo ! I was counting the money . Val ! We 're rich ! " Cut this thing down to two pounds , " Gold continued , pointing to the screenplay . On cue laughter broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a folksy mood , retelling a story to me about how his family ran a butcher shop in Chicago and how they cheated their " colored " customers by putting their thumb on the scale when they weighed the meat . More laughter . He cleared his throat and the entourage leaped to its collective feet . The audience with his eminence was over . " It 's been a real pleasure meeting you , Colonel , " I said , " but the nexttime you buy one of my books , keep your fucking thumb off the scale . " Everyone turned a pale shade of green in unison , while the Colonelmulled that one over . He finally decided it was funny and burst intolaughter , at which time the ten others present also burst into laughter . I HAD A strange , wild , and unique situation working for me at Pacific . For a number of years after the war , many military films had been uncomplimentary to the services . From Here to Eternity , The Caine Mutiny , and a number of others stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a boil when Metro did a picture called Take the High Ground . The Defense Department found it too anti-Army and stopped all further cooperation with the studios . Unless the Army , Navy , Marines , and Air Force provided masses of men , guns , tanks , ships , planes , and equipment , the cost of the big war film was too much for the studios to bear. 68 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 69Thus far Pacific Studios had been clean and everyone was keeping an eye on Of Men in Battle . I was sent back to Washington to go over the script with the Marine Corps and take out the objectionable parts . The Corps did n't Sind a hell of a lot wrong . At the end of an easy week , I was ushered into the commandant 's office . It was down to PFC Zadok and a four-star general . " My first duty is to the Corps , sir , " I told him . " If the studio gets out of line , I 'll let you know immediately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was one of theirs and they trusted me . I returned to Pacific with a golden club to hold over the Colonel 's head . At one point the studio tried to deviate from my screenplay by secretlyputting on another writer . I walked out of the studio , leaving a two-word letter on my desk ; namely , " I quit . " The next day I was implored to return . The Corps had expressed its displeasure . " We feel that it is in everyone 's best interest to keep Zadok on through the filming . " What the hell . The Corps was allowing Pacific to have eight cameras film their maneuvers and landing on Vieques Island in the Caribbean . Colonel Gold got the message . I do n't know whether von Dortann had hired another writer on his own volition or on orders from the studio . I do know he was removed from the film and I suddenly functionedas a part-time producer , in on everything from casting to the final cut . That 's the way it goes in this town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being filmed , the studio pulled out several shelved screenplays for me to putter around with . Two dead projects were revived and one of them made it to the cameras and gained me a reputation as a script doctor . Then came my ultimate coup . I was working late in one of the cuttingrooms with the Colonel and we both got blasted and I conned him into a world premiere in my hometown , Baltimore . " You 're the God-damnedest hustler I 've ever seen , Zadok . " " I take that as a compliment , Colonel . Baltimore is going to love you . " " I 've got nothing against a hustler , as long as he 's doing it on my behalf , " he said . I was kept on as a script doctor until the film was released . Of Men in Battle went on to become one of a half-dozen great films of World War II and made a bundle for the studio . As my time was running out I began thinking hard about my nextnovel . How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , was I really using Val as a crutch for my own indecision ? Then came a famous " summons " to Colonel Gold 's office . This could cause mere writers to shake , rattle , and roll . What was more , Sal Sensibarhad been " summoned " as well . Gold had set the stage for something big . " I like you , Zadok ! " he said after wearing us out with a couple of his cornball jokes . " I like you big ! " Sensibar began levitating right there in the office . The Colonel then offered me a three-year writer/producer contract starting at two thousand dollars a week and ending at four thousand . Jaysus ! Jaysus ! Valhalla ! He had made damned sure Sal was present , in case I had any ideas of rejecting his offer . Sal retreated , groveling out backward , which was no easy trick . " You 've got me , Zadok , " Gold said as a parting shot . " See , I took my thumb off the scale . " Does all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left all the rotten parts on the cutting-room floor . I was a fool to think I was going to be the first golden boy who drifted into town , made a killing , and drifted out without getting my hands bloody . My thirtieth birthday was comingup and I had a lot to think over . As WE LEFT the Colonel 's office , Sal Sensibar was breathing orgasmically . By the time we reached the parking lot he was having hot flashes , groaning , and his eyes were wild like he 'd just seen the glory of the coming of the Lord . " Romanoff s tonight , " Sal said , " eight-thirty . " Sal was a toucher , a knee slapper . He gazed into my eyes with all the pathos of a pleading German shepherd and pinched my cheek . " Bubele , " he said . That 's all he could say , " Bubele , bubele . " Sal had a stable of over twenty writers , most of them working . I had just replaced the reigning king . As Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas attack and doused the fire with an antacid . " Romanoff 's , eight-thirty , and do n't be late , bubele , we 've some heavy celebrating to do . Tonight with the wives . Tomorrow , who knows ? " " Are n't you celebrating a little early , Sal ? " " No jokes , no fucking jokes , Gideon . " " I did n't tell Gold I was taking his offer . " Sal 's face expressed pain , deep , terrible pain . " Do n't make with the jokes . " 70 LEON URIS " Why do n't we skip Romanoff 's . Let 's have lunch tomorrow and we 'll talk about it . Calm down , Sal , you look like you 've just been liberated from Auschwitz . " Sweat broke out simultaneously on Sal 's shirt front , his face , and his armpits . He fished around his jacket pocket for his date book . " Lunch . How about breakfast ? Why not let 's talk it over at your house tonight ? Why wait for tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch , " I said . " Frascati 's , Beverly Hills , okay ? One o'clock . " Sal was having a difficult time getting the key into his Jaguar door . I turned and without further word headed back to my office . " Do n't you even want to ... " " See you tomorrow . " The writers ' building at Pacific was set up so that it could be ob served from all directions by the studio police . The only thing missing was guard towers . The Colonel had a number of petty obsessions . One of them was to keep his writers penned in . A few writers around town were beginning to work at home . I planned to make a stand on it , if and when I did another screenplay . My secretary Belle Prentice was on pins and needles waiting for me to return from my meeting with Gold . A summons from Gold 's office was a chilling thing . I stopped at her desk in the outer office . " Any calls , anything ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted me to have dinner with her . She would be the dinner . Another from a tennis partner , Johnny Brookes . Another from a visiting relative who wanted a tour through a studio . " Call them back . Tell them I 've gone for the day . " Belle trailed me into my office . I flopped on the couch . " Will you tell me what happened ? " she demanded . " The Colonel wants me to remain at the studio . A three-year writer/ producer deal . " " Congratulations ! " " I told him I 'd think it over . " Belle 's face saddened . " You 've already made your mind up , have n't you ? " " Six months ago . I 'll get my crap out of here tomorrow . Do you want me to put in a word for you with anyone in particular ? " " No , I 'll just go back to the secretarial pool and take my chances . " " I 'm sorry , Belle . You 've been real thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd had a heavy year together . She 'd covered for me a dozen times and even marched into von Dortann 's office and chewed him out on my behalf . She closed the door behind her and returned to her office . I gave a sentimental look around the room . The office had once been occupied by William Faulkner on one of the thousand and one studio projects that never got off the ground . Belle had been his secretary . She used to siphon him out of the gutter , blind drunk . He apparently needed the money . This was n't a difficult decision for me . All I had to do was spend an evening with Kurt von Dortann to see what I 'd become in three years . What I did n't want to face was the coming shoot-out at home , tonight . Val and I were having a lot of heavy arguments . A half-dozen times , when I was waging trench warfare at the studio , Val had disappointed me . She blew up at me for refusing to sign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was an affront to me after having served in the Marine Corps . Later , the oath was judged unconstitutional . It did n't matter  --  I was still wrong in her eyes . Val had turned on me when I walked out of the studio after von Dortann put on a writer behind my back . Hell , I was back at work two days later . I was the bad guy for not cooperating with the studio . It was my fault for standing up to Gold . Val did n't want me to fight about anything that would endanger my jobs with the studios . It hurts to say it , but she was an out-and-out appeaser . Val was happy down there , sterilized by the good life . " Do n't Rock the Boat " might as well have been done in petit point and hung over the fireplace . I did n't want to commit to writing a full-time screenplay until 1 completed my second novel , so I took short doctoring jobs . There comes a moment in the life of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give away a piece of his soul . When you 're dealing with the swollen egos of actors , actresses , and directors , you 've got to try to remember that they are the boss  --  even though they ca n't read a script , even though their arguments are moronic . They 're the boss . When the inevitable showdown came , Val raised purple hell with me for playing it tough . She really was livid when I turned down a project , a flat-fee screenplayfor Columbia for fifty thousand dollars . The project was a piece of trash . Not one bloody word of understanding from her . I do n't know what it was with Val . I 'd never seen this in her before . Maybe it was because she had been raised in the Navy where you obey orders and do n't make problems. 72 LEON URIS " What 's the difference , Gideon , " she argued . " Nobody remembers the name of the screenwriter . You recall what Sal told you the first day . What you 've written is between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know screenwriting runs against your grain , but you get paid a hell of a lot for your discomfort . " A lot of nights I drove out to the Holiday House past Malibu when I 'd had a fight at the studio . I 'd walk over to Paradise Cove , rent fishing gear , and fish from the pier . I was just too damned beat to go home and have her blast at me . Well , you know what follows . I started taking women out to the Holiday House . Lots of them . What troubled me about the other women was that I felt less and less guilty about it after each brawl with Val . After Sal drove off , I returned to my office . I dialed home a half- dozen times . The line was busy . Obviously Sal had headed for the first pay phone . That son of a bitch had gotten to Val first . He was chewing her ear off . Belle came in with tea . I remained on the couch and she took my chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still busy . " " You liked Faulkner an awful lot , did n't you ? " Belle smiled . " Secretly , I suppose I loved him . He was a great man , very genteel and soft-spoken . Yes ma'am , Miss Belle , no ma'am , Miss Belle . He always called me Miss Belle . " " How was he able to take Stanley Gold ? " " I sat in to take notes on quite a few story conferences . It became apparent early on that Mr. Faulkner 's project would never get off the ground . But Gold kept him on , much like a pet dog . I think the Colonel got off on the very notion that he had control over the mind of a great writer like Mr. Faulkner . He loved to berate Mr. Faulkner , the same as he does von Dortann . The same as he does with anyone who 's afraid of him . Mr. Faulkner would go to pieces . He was always at one of three or four bars along Ventura Boulevard . George and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes we 'd have to put him to bed . " " The resolution of fear is one of the writer 's greatest reasons for being , " I said . Belle smiled again . " That 's from his Nobel acceptance speech . " She answered the phone and covered the mouthpiece . " It 's Stanley Gold . " " Hello , Colonel , " I said . " Zadok . I was thinking that it might be time to pop some bubbly . I 'd love to give a little dinner party for you over at my place . How about Friday ? " " Sorry , I ca n't . One of my daughters is in a play at school . You know how that one goes . " There was a long , expected silence . Gold was stashing this rebuff in his memory book . " Another time , " he said , " you 'll be around . " I tried home again . The line was still busy .

" " They 've been looking forward to this program all week . So , why make a fuss , every single week ? " The volcano was rumbling within . I went into the living room and took a crack at reading a magazine . Val came in . She was glum . She paced and looked at me , sort of out of the corner of her eye . " Sal called , " she said . " He told me all about your meeting with the Colonel . " I did n't answer her . " Well , what are you going to tell him ? " " I told him I 'd think it over .

Being selfish is one of my job requirements . But I 'm not going to be a producer for Stanley Gold , period , paragraph , end of report . There 's a few more things we 'd better get cleaned up , right now . " " Look at you . You 're begging for a fight . Nobody can talk to you when you 're in this kind of mood . " " Every time we have something to talk over , you start out by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things have piled up . We 'd better sort them out . " Val became more and more defensive when there was something to thrash out . Delay it , stuff it in the closet , do anything but face up and get it over with . Half of our life was the unspoken words . I 'd get angry and stomp out and when I returned Val would pretend that absolutely nothing had happened . " I 'm going to my office , " I said . " If you feel like talking , come on over . Incidentally , I 'm going to cut out for a few days for San Francisco . I need to hang out , see some of the guys . " " I ca n't stop you . " THE OPENING SALVOS had been fired . The silent period now ruled the scene . The ice age was setting in . My office was a little guest cottage on the other side of the pool . I rehearsed my arguments just as I was certain Val was rehearsing hers . The only problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't give the answers I expected . Our mouths76 LEON URIS were set on automatic . Usually within two minutes we 'd both blown off course , and sometimes we even forgot what we were fighting about . I poked about the office . I could n't concentrate on reading . No use phoning around . Did n't want to answer my mail . Letter from my old man . Better not read it now . Nothing on the tube . I stretched on the couch and continued to present my bulletproof case to the " jury . " One of the unwritten rules was that Val had to give in first and come to me . A couple of times I caved in and went to her first . No way , this time . At around two in the morning , I could hear the shuffle of her steps . I drew the blanket over me and feigned sleep . A knock , the door opened , and a small light was turned on . " Honey , " she peeped softly . I grunted as though coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched , yawned , looked over my surroundings , and " remembered " where I was . Val slipped into the easy chair as I dunked my face and wiped it . " We 'd better start from square one , " I said . " When J. III and Reaves accepted Of Men in Battle , the only plans we made regarding the future were a few vague mentions of trying to find a nicer place in Sausalito . Soon as the screenplay was done , we 'd go back up there and I 'd keep writing books . " " Things have changed , Gideon . You 've opened up a second career in the studios . We have other options in life now . " " Val , I 've got to decide what I want to be when I grow up . I ca n't be a producer . I 'd murder half of the actors and directors I know . Point two . This town is stacked against the writers . What we 've gotten into is an endless war to try to retain normalcy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel for months . San Francisco is n't even in your vocabulary anymore . Inch by inch I 'm being sucked in , down here . " " For the first eighteen years of my life , I was a Navy brat . We lived on twelve different bases . And for the first eight years of our marriage , we lived a nightmare . We 're happy here . I want a home , " she said . " So do I. But it 's got to be outside of this magnetic field . I do n't know if I can produce books in this atmosphere . This problem is going to come up again and again . " " Suppose you want to write a novel on India the next time , or Alaska ? " " What are you telling me , Val ? No more novels ? What else is buzzing around in your head ? " She was frightened and did n't want to say what was on the edge of her tongue . " What else , Val ? " I demanded . " Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poverty . You have to stay near the studios . " That was blunt enough . I owed my family a living and a home and I had no business dragging them around the world . " School vacation starts next month . You and the girls come up to San Francisco with me for three months . I 'll finish my research and come back here and write the book . We 'll decide what to do afterward . " " I 'm not going up there with you to be a writer 's nurse and whore . I 've enrolled in art school . " She unloaded the heavy artillery on me . Subtle but rich with innuendo . What she was saying , silently , was that I had ruined her promising career as an artist . She had made all the big sacrifices for me and now it was my turn . Val understood one thing . She knew I had a dreadful fear of loneliness . I 'd go to pieces if I had to eat a meal alone in a restaurant . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my finger out of the telephone dial . I could n't hack it alone in San Francisco . " Christ sake , there are art schools in San Francisco ! " "  --  Neither Penny , Roxy , nor I want to be around with your hookers and pimps . " " But that 's the book I 'm writing ! Val , I 'm not buying this . For ten years you 've complained about the magnificent career you lost on account of me . You 're using this fantasy career to lie to yourself . You want to hear it ? You do n't have the talent or the balls to make it . If you needed it like I need to write , you would have done it ten years ago . Dammit , all it is is a lie to keep a weapon over my head . " WELL , I DID N'T GO to San Francisco to finish my research . Val knew I would n't . Of course , she never set foot in art school either . So , I wrote The Tenderloin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really needed double that time , but Sal kept pressure on me and Val had established a fat lifestyle . When the book was finished , Val found a lovely home on three acres in Woodland Hills that had every yummy thing that any girl would want , forever and ever . Stable , pool , tennis court , big oaks , the works . I 'd need a screenplay right away . Several months later , The Tenderloin was published . Do you want the78 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 79long version or the short version ? It bombed . Of all the hurts inflicted on me , none was more devastating than what one reviewer wrote : " Zadok must have written the novel in an orange grove . He certainly did n't go anywhere near the tenderloin . " The Tenderloin was a flat , glossy , imitation Runyon , a superficial exercisefor me to zip through and then get back to what was really important in life , making money . If . If . . . if . . . IF ! IF I had taken the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have captured the unique lilt and toughness of the place . IF the rabbit had n't stopped to take a crap he would have caught the turtle . Val and I did n't talk much about The Tenderloin . We did n't have to . A man can lie to his boss , his wife , his children , but he ca n't lie to the typewriter . Sooner or later truths will emerge . The truth was that I was writing about people who were suffering , but I never felt their pain and the readers saw right through me . It 's hard to feel your stomach growl with hunger on two thousand dollars a week . Want to play the novel game ? You 've got to bare it all . I was going to dwell in shit city forever . I envisioned the yellow brick road stretched out before me . Producership , maybe with Stanley Gold . Television series , bundles of money involved . Take any ridiculous idea and embellish it with canned laughter . Crap is selling these days like never before . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , did n't I also swear I 'd be a writer He would be proud of ? Golden handcuffs . Mink-lined cells . God almighty , Val bought me shirts with my initials on the pockets . My asthma was returning . I had n't had an attack in fifteen years . Maybe I 've got to see a shrink . Fire a shot on Bedford Drive and you 'll hit fifty of them . It had become apparent that with all my bluster , I did n't really have what it takes . I could n't stomach the sacrifice anymore and I blamed it on Val or Sal or Mal or Gold . Everyone but myself . All right ! I have n't got it ! Leave me in peace ! I HAVE N'T GOT IT ! " HELLO , Zadok speaking . " " Gideon , you old mother . How you been ? " " Junkyard ? " " That 's what they call me . " " Oh , buddy , you 're a voice for the weary . Where are you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm on the way to Hong Kong on a business trip . I was hoping you 'd be in town . " My spirits lifted . Sergeant Kelly Murphy had been an old Marine buddy . We called him Junkyard because he 'd collect the oddest pieces of worthless trash and somehow always get rid of it for a profit . A regular rug merchant . Along with running his oriental bazaar , Murphy was a hell of a gam- bler , one of the best crap shooters I 'd ever seen . He left the Corps with a sizable bankroll . Junkyard had done a hitch in the Corps before the war , which in- cluded service in the Caribbean . He swore he was going to return there after the war , and he did , in spades . Starting with one small boat , he scoured the Caribbean for war surplus and ended up with a small fleet of tramp steamers and a couple of airplanes . We always stayed in touch , even before my first book was published . Penny and Boxy adored him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she 'd grown up with so many colorful characters in the Navy . On the other hand , she detested him because when he blew into town I was always bound to go out on a real twister for a few days . We started out at Tail o ' the Cock , and ended up at his cottage at the Beverly Hills , with numerous intermediate stops . " You have n't drawn a happy breath since you 've been down here but I 've never seen you like this , " Junkyard said . " I saw six hundred that 's six zero zero  --  screenwriters bow like sheep in the face of a loyalty oath . When I refused to sign , Colonel Gold recited to me , for the first time , those immortal words , You 'll never work in this town again . ' Son of a bitch hired me two weeks later to get a bungled script into order . " Junkyard unpeeled the top of a new vodka bottle . I was on the stuff , straight , now . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting call go out for dumb , big-titted redheads answered by five hundred big-titted redheads who went down on forty-two producers and a partridge in a pear tree . " I banged down some hors d'oeuvres and a shot . " Speaking of big-titted redheads , the girls should be showing up pretty soon . " " Why do n't you give them a call and tell them we 'll catch up with them tomorrow night . I think you need to talk to your buddy , " Junk- yard said . " I 'm running off at the mouth . Better shut up . " 80 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 81 " It 's hidden down there pretty deep . It 's got to find its way out of you , Gideon . " I dialed . " Hello , Brenda , Gideon . Sorry to break your heart , lover , but we 're not going to be able to get together tonight . We 'll take care of the tab . Hold tomorrow night open . You 're a real doll . " I could n't look Junkyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ever see a peacock spread its fan and shriek ? Horrible sound . You whore writers are n't making me beautiful enough . And the broads come after your nuts with switchblade knives . I owe this Oscar to all the little people , the grips , the cameramen , the wardrobe mistress , but most of all to MY writers . " " You was always a big pain in the ass , Gideon . Always hustling . If it had been up to you , you would have turned the whole regiment into dancing boys and staged the biggest fucking review the world had ever seen . " " Let me tell you something . It 's not normal , or human , or decent , to ask a man to write a novel . Three to five years in that God-damned darkness ! " " Then stop crying in your beer and be thankful for what you 've got . " " Shit ! Go to Hong Kong ! I do n't have to listen to your shit ! You were always full of shit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junkyard was a big strong man and when he grabbed you , you knew it . He took my shoulders and shook me . " What 's scaring you ! " I tore out of his arms and could feel my chest tightening up . I was going to have a goddam asthma attack ! He came up behind me . " We 're coming into the beach ! The Japs have opened fire ! The ramp drops ! What 's scaring you ? Is it the Jew business ? Are you haunted by dreams about Pedro ? You 're the biggest man to come out of our regiment ! We 're proud when we can just touch you ! Now what 's scaring you ? " " Loneliness ! " I screamed . It grew very quiet . His eyes were filled with the kind of sorrow he had after the battle . I realized then , I meant something special to a lot of Marines . " God , " he whispered . " It 's a terrible fear , so awful . I do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Fuck all , I ca n't make it . " " You 've got to get your ass out of this town and prove you can bearyour loneliness . Look at you , son . You 're so unhappy you 're going to put a gun to your head . " " I do n't know if I can , man . " " I 've got a nice setup on St. Barthelemy . I want you to go down there and get your shit together . " " I do n't know , man , I do n't know . " UNLIKE F. Toren WALLACE , Sal Sensibar could smell a deal in the making from two continents away . He 'd go through trash cans , listen from stalls in the men 's room , supply girls for a key lawyer at the studio . Sal knew what was going on and he did n't learn it from reading Variety . There was a particular producer in town I truly admired , Judd Schlosberg . Who would n't ? He had been a wonderchild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became one of the first independentproducers in Hollywood . When you meet with a producer and he says , " I have the greatest respect for the writer , " you know the son of a bitch is lying . Judd Schlosberg probably never uttered those words but he had worked successfullywith Maxwell Anderson , Tennessee Williams , and John Steinbeck . That was really what attracted me . He usually left his writers alone and a goodly number of his scripts were lush and translated to the screen with great care and taste . Schlosberghad four Oscars on a shelf behind his desk for best picture , plus the Thalberg Award for lifetime achievement and the Hersholt HumanitarianAward . When Sal found out Schlosberg had purchased an obscure little story about the great Texas gunfighter , John Hardin , from Atlantic , I told him I wanted him to get me the job . Judd Schlosberg was a short man , barely over five feet , with a kind of angelic face . His office was a subtle showcase of his achievements , a holy room topped off with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough bullshit from the lips of glib writersto create landfill for a medium-sized city . I was n't about to give him his first snow job . " You do n't have any track record as a Western writer , " he said . " This story could be set on a ship , with a gang of tunnel workers , with a football team . The whole world is one big cowboy story . There 's no mystery to a Western . I asked for a crack at this because I know what you saw in the story and what you want out of it . " " What did I see in it ? " 82 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 83 " You 've got everyone in Hollywood riding in those sixteen saddles . Maybe the whole world . " He knew my perception and approach were exactly like his and gave me four weeks to do a treatment . I took no shortcuts . It was the best I could write . I needed this one so badly I found places my typewriter had never roamed . Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks , Sal called . " We 've heard from Schlosberg 's office . He wants to see us tomorrowat ten . " Heart in the throat time . " How do you read it , Sal ? " " I 'm positive he wants to go into screenplay . " FROM THE TIME Junkyard had left for Hong Kong , I never spoke with Val about the gist of our evening . Nonetheless his words preyed on my mind , constantly . If I were to make one last shot at being a novelist I had to find the courage to overcome my dread of loneliness . I knew that there were a raft of other phobias I would have to conquer in order to become a complete novelist . It does n't fall like manna from heaven . I had made the decision that if Judd Schlosberg gave me the screenplayI would do it alone in St. Barthelemy . One of the cheapest commoditiesin the world is unfulfilled genius . All of us want to be known as a unique individual , the one who broke out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacrifice and what you 're afraid of is losing and being thrown back into the pack . One question taunts you . Do you want to have , or do you want to be ? I realized now that I 'd have to prove something all my life . I could never go a hundred yards without a barrier blocking my way . I had run out of time in keeping my plans from Val . Tomorrow Schlosberg might give me the screenplay and I 'd have to tell her . We were at poolside . Val was fixing drinks . She had on high heels and a bikini . Still a dynamite-looking woman . " Cheers , " she said with a kiss . " So , tomorrow 's the big day . Why do n't we go to New York or Vegas for a long weekend and shoot out the lights ? " My expression must have been grim . She reacted with apprehensive curiosity . " You certainly do n't look like the man who has just snared the brass ring . " " Val , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If you want to work at the studio , that 's okay with me . I 'm going to miss having you around . " " I mean I want to go off and write it . " " Holy mackerel , Amos , this is a little sudden . " " For you , not for me . I 've been stewing over it for weeks . " " Good Lord , Gideon , you ca n't do a thing for yourself . You 're help-less . " " I know . A lot of things have piled up . The closet needs a cleaning out . " She was getting my drift that I was n't going to change my mind . She shrugged and loosened my leash a bit , but still held firmly . " So , write in Malibu . I can spend most nights with you and we can have the girls on the weekend . Say , it might be fun , after all . " " Val , I 'm going to the Caribbean . Alone . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Val always had the trump card , my fear of loneliness . When backed into a corner , she never hesitated to use it . It had never failed to work . " I realize we all need space but being a writer does n't give you license to abandon your family and home . God , you make me feel I 've driven you out . It 's that damned book , The Tenderloin . " " It 's not you , not the girls , not the studios , not Los Angeles . It 's me . Gideon Zadok is treading water . I thought we had given up so much to do the first book , the rest of the way would be covered with rose pet-als . " " That bastard Murphy put you up to this . " " Nobody put me up to anything . I cried for mercy . I 'm lost , Val . Murphy understood . Becoming a true novelist means that I 've got to be prepared to give up much more than I 've given up till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a writer again who can look at his face in the mirror without cringing . As for now , Val , I 'm going wherever my work takes me . If you and the girls can come , wonderful . If I have to go it alone , that 's what I 'm going to do . " She must have been numbed . I could hardly believe these words were coming from my mouth . " I may fall flat on my face . I may not have the stuff . But I 'm not going out without protest . I 'm going to write another book , baby , and I 'm going to give it everything I 've got . " We were consumed by deadly , black silence . " You 're cruel ! You 're rotten ! You selfish son of a bitch . " She had n't heard a bloody word ! She felt nothing I was pleading for ! Val flung her glass . It skidded over the patio . Glad it was plastic . She stood over me heaving her chest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you enroll in art school ? " I said with all the meanness I could muster . " What about me ! " she cried . " What about me ? " I asked . ALPACA SWEATERS- with muttonchop sleeves were the costume of the moment . Schlosberg wore a tan alpaca , Sal a blaring red , and I had on a white one to indicate chastity , modesty , and virtue . Schlosberg lit a cigar that seemed half his size and he hung on my every word . We seemed to be of a single mind as to where we were taking the story but something was annoying him . I smelled that he had not totally made up his mind . " Up front ? " he asked when I had finished . Oh God , here it comes , the goodbye kiss . " Of course , " I said . " I like some of your work , Zadok . I like most of what you said here today . Now , I 've always treated my writers as adults , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood to permit writers to work at home . If home be Santa Barbara or New York . I 've even let a couple of the Englishmen work in London . As long as we can stay in communication . But Sal tells me you want to write this in .. . uh . " " St. Barthelemy . " " WVY ? " 1 'll " Up front ? The house of Zadok is tottering . But mainly , I believe it 's going to make the script better . " " Are you fucking me over , Zadok ? Why is it going to make the script better ? " " I want to create an atmosphere where I can achieve total , absolute concentration . This is going to be a great script . " " Nine out of ten scripts bomb . Who do you think you are ? " We had worked out a flat deal . I would write a screenplay for fifty thousand dollars and I would be paid  --  good , bad , or mediocre . Okay , bubele , this is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a month to see if I 'm doing the story right , or if I 'm whacking off on the beach . If you do n't get my pages on time or if you do n't like them , the deal is off . You do n't owe me a dime . " I thought Sal would swallow his cigar . " You 're serious , are n't you , Zadok ? Why are you putting yourself through this ? " " Hard for me to put it into words . " " I have n't noticed any overpowering shyness from you . " I shook my head . " You 've heard too much shit in this office from too many shit merchants . " " Why , Zadok ? " " When I die , I want one word on my tombstone beside my name : author . I 'm not as gifted as a lot of novelists . But I 'm not picking soft spots for myself . I 'm in a fight to find out if I have the balls and the discipline . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , it 's going to kill you . " " At least I 'll die with a shit-eating grin on my face . " " Good luck , Gideon , I mean that . " I stopped in the outer office to phone Val . " Hello . " " Hi , baby , we 're in screenplay , " I said . She hung up on me . I MONKEYED AROUND town most of the day , dreading another brawl at home . It was evening when I turned into the driveway . I sensed something was very wrong . Usually our golden retriever hung out by the main gate waiting for me . No Grover Vandover . I opened the front door and called in . No Val , no maid , no girls . I was startled ! What 's going on here ? Thoughts of a robbery or that maybe one of the girls had been hurt ran through my mind . " Val ! Penny ! Roxy ! " I heard Grover whimper and made for Roxanne 's room . Her dresser drawers were open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry . Penny 's room was the same . Jesus ! What 's going on ! No note on the kitchen board . Knock off this shit , Val ! I saw Val 's car in the carport . Did an ambulance come ? What the hell ? Wait a minute . Val might still be here . I flung open our bedroom door . There it was ! Pinned onto the pillow with a rose lying across it . My special little address book . It must have had fifty to a hundred names of girlfriends , hookers , escorts . There were even phone numbers for some of Val 's best girlfriends , the divorced ones . I drew the line at other men 's wives . I must have gotten sloppy careless and left it out . I went outside and looked around . My office , maybe . I opened the door . It was an awful sight . Val had gone through it with a club or knives . Everything was smashed . My bookcases were overturned andthe books all ripped up . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , my record collection scratched to uselessness , all the windows broken . The stuffing from my couch and armchairhad been cut out with a knife . . . all my photographs knocked down and trampled , the curtains slashed . That 's it . The safe was opened . Val had found the combination and gotten the address book out of it . Manuscript papers were shredded and hurled all over the room . The pistol was gone ! Wait ! My chair filled with bullet holes , the empty gun on the floor . Valerie stood in the doorway to the kitchenette . She tossed a bigbladedkitchen knife and a baseball bat to the ground and stood , frightfullycalm . My first reaction was one of relief that she had n't hurt herself . " Where are the girls ? " She did n't answer . " Are they with your mother ? " " Yes , " she said softly . " Get out . You can have one of your buddies come over and get your stuff . " " Oka " Y  --  Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I repeated . " I had a long talk with some of your lady friends , " she said with a twisted smile on her lips . " They said they 'd put me down as an extra girl . If there 's a big party I can go out and do a few tricks with them . Fifty bucks a pop , three hundred for an all-night party . You do n't have any objections , do you ? " " I 've been very unhappy , Val . But no matter what happened , you did n't deserve this . " " Does Phil Delaney know you 're balling Joany ? Did you fuck her in our bed ? And sweet little Mary Allen . Prettiest little math teacher I ever did see . Fucking wholesale meat operation ! " " Val . " " Get out ! " " Okay , but there 's one thing I want to know . You 've known about this for a long , long time , Val . Why did n't you stop me ? " She put her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whores , " she wept , " whores , whores , whores . " St. Barths , 1956OKAY , BUSTER , you fought for it , you won it . You now have the absolute right to go bust your ass on another novel . So , go get it . St. Barthelemy ? I did n't know the place existed or where it existed . The ultimate romance of the novelist , self-imposed exile . Real Somerset Maugham stuff . My knowledge of the Caribbean was formed by Hollywood studios when I was a kid . So many of our conceptions of life and places were made on sound stages . Yo , ho , ho and a bottle of rum . Steamy jungles , miserable black slaves sweating in the sugarcane fields , voodoo rites . Devil 's Island where no man escapes , except in a wooden box . Maureen O'Hara , so magnificent , so voluptuous . Bruce Cabot now there was a villain for you . I 'd duel my way , Errol Flynn style , through ten Basil Rathbones to free my beloved from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me after I boarded the plane in L.A. I usually became maudlin after a few drinks at eighteen thousand feet . Val , I 've hurt you so badly . I ca n't even comprehend the visions that must have run through your mind on the hundred and one nights when I was away from home . Maybe I was predestined to go to St. Barthelemy to salvage something , to pay penance . Christ in the wilderness . Val . . . Val . . . I bit my lip hard to hold back tears for the want of another chance to stroke Penny 's hair and read to her , or the kicks I got watching Roxanne taking jumps on her pony . " This is for you , Daddy . I made it in art class . " Remorse was punctuated by the white-knuckle aspects of flying in the Caribbean in 1955 . The trip was n't for sissies . After Miami , I changed from one baling-wire airline to another , from Cuba down to Jamaica and then up to Haiti and over to Puerto Rico to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tex Richie , one of Junkyard Murphy 's pilots . Generally speaking , old , fat-bellied pilots gave me a feeling of security . They had survived . Tex Richie was old , fat , and spoke with a whiskey-flavored Southwestern drawl . He did n't exactly fill me with confidence . The plane gave me even less . It was an odd , dumpy configuration made in88 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 89Holland with a push-pull engine in the rear . Tex called it a STOL , acronym for Short Take Off and Landing . When he put on a thick pair of glasses to read the map , I almost called the whole thing off . " There 's the little mother , " he said , holding a magnifying glass . " Where ? " " There . " SHIT ! " Where 's the runway ? " " Oh , it 's there all right . All thirteen hundred feet of it . " " Thirteen hundred feet ! " " Hell , ai n't no worse than landing on the deck of a carrier . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot for the island 's sheep . When it gets down low enough , they sweep the sheep shit off it and use it as a soccer field . Junkyard told me to take real good care of you . They 're mowing the field for our arrival . " Reinforced by that bit of intelligence , we took off . The flight was short and choppy . We came to a confluence of islands . Tex pointed out a speck . " St. Barths . " Good Lord , was he kidding ? He flew over it once to see if any emergencypanels had been laid out and to check the wind sock . " God dammit , " he grumbled . " What 's wrong ? " " We got a twenty-five-knot tail wind . It 's gon na be a good one . " He went out to sea , circled back , and lowered the plane until we were but a few hundred feet over the water , then he banked her almost ninety degrees . At this terrifying angle we were being kicked from behindby the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stall and drop us into the sea . Tex held this attitude and the stall warning beeped . " Motherfucker , " he garbled under his breath . The runway went from the water 's edge and then took off uphill into a dead end of boulder-filled hillocks . If we touched down too far up the runway it seemed there was little chance of getting her up in the air again quickly enough . " Used to have an awful lot of pileups , " he said to comfort me . At the last instant , with the stall button blaring , Tex leveled her out and let her glide . She hit the runway twenty feet in from the water 's edge and started an uphill run coming to a halt with  --  oh hell , a good ten or twelve feet to spare . Piece of cake . And then I lightened up . At the side of the runway by the shack apleasant-looking couple stood beside a battered jeep and waved us in . Denise and Pierre Dumont , Junkyard 's caretakers . They fussed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I might have been the first Jew ever to have set foot on the place . I really did n't know what I was expecting  --  a thatched hut , a cave dwelling , a spear-carrying native chief . Junkyard had digs on a halfdozenislands . This one turned out to be a petite but nicely built villa . It obviously belonged to a skilled trader , for it was supplied to the gunwaleswith everything from bug spray to bourbon . All I would need was one pair of shoes , one pair of shorts , and my typewriter . The location was primo . Villa Murphy was on a small hillside above a magnificent curve of beach , a bay called St. Jean . It was a three-minute walk from the front door to the strand . In the next few days I made friends with the Dumonts and their five children , who had their own home a short distance away . They spoke French with a sprinkling of English and we worked out a palatable language . Pierre was Junkyard 's man on St. Barths , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next few days . It was a speck of a place , a volcanic rock of about eight square miles . Leaping and bounding hills , cliffs , and rockfalls were ribboned by a few dozen kilometers of road , some of cement , some of volcanic rock , and some of washboard dirt . Tire busters , one and all . It was a roller coaster with a few flat stretches here and there with potholes  --  I hesitate to call them potholes , as they were large enough to make the jeep almost vanish . A dozen Lilliputian bays were serene on the leeward side and inclined to violence on the windward . Warm water rolled or bashed up onto the most magnificent beaches of wheatfield-colored off-white sands . St. Barths was not what you would call a garden spot , but the ash was rich and there were many wild runs of bougainvillea wrapping around scrub trees and smatterings of wild-flower cover . No turn in any direction was without understated beauty . There was little fertile land and it was easy to see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustavia , a pearl of a little harbor , housed a waterfront quay and a half-dozen dirt streets . Most of the island 's fifteen hundred population lived around there . The Select Bar on the quay was the central watering hole . St. Barths proved to be an anachronism for this part of the world . Because she was so tiny , one by six miles , no sugar plantation ever rooted there and thus the island never had slaves . The inhabitants were mostly of French ancestry from Normandy and Brittany . It seemed90 LEON URIS M I T L A PASS 91more of a misplaced parcel of France . Some of the older women still wore Amish-like bonnets and long black skirts and the men dressed in seafaring blue . St. Barths had some beef cattle , a smattering of vegetable and fruit plots and , of course , the bountiful sea . There was intense trade with a radius of neighboring islands . One got the idea quickly that black market , white market , and free market were the key to existence . Junkyard had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some wealthy French had found St. Barths . Yachtsmen had wanderedon it . There were a few dozen small villas in spellbinding cliffside locations , including a half dozen belonging to Americans . One is always leery of being an outsider and crashing their solitude . I need n't have worried . " Junkyard " was the magic name . He had shipped in most of the building materials for the homes erected since the war . Because it was a place where every outsider came looking for the same thing , friendships formed easily , and the islanders were just about the nicest people I had ever met . Life was unencumbered with the problems , values , and intricacies of modern civilization . There was some electricity , always unreliable , of the home generator variety . One school , one doctor . Otherwise there were no telephones , waterworks , or sewers . Directly below Villa Murphy , St. Jean 's beach was split in half by an enormous boulder of lava that ran out to the sea . On this outcropping , built on several levels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five rooms . I befriended the owner , a flier named Remy de Haenen who had pioneered the airstrip . His wife , like Denise Dumont and most of the women , was a superb chef , making little miracles of meals with the lean pickings from the fields . Otherwise there was a lot of beach to meditate on , a lot of sunsets to watch , a lot of conversation at the Select Bar . I do n't know if anyone ever called me by my name . I was simply " the writer . " How utterly strange the way things turned out . I came girded for battle , to scale or bash down walls of fear I had erected all my life . When I opened my eyes on St. Barths , the walls simply vanished . Instead , St. Barths opened its arms wide and caressed me and told me , " Take off your pack and stand at ease , Marine , and be afraid no more . " I learned to shut out of my mind anything that distracted me from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Roxy . This was my fear , remembering . It was a revelation that I had the capacity to forget . This was what I came to find . The conquest of loneliness was themissing link that was , one day , going to make a decent novelist out of me . If you are out here and can not close off the loves and hates of all that back there in the real world , the memories will overtake you and swamp you and wilt your tenacity . Tenacity , stamina . . . close off to everything and everyone but your writing . That 's the bloody price . I do n't know , maybe it 's some kind of ultimate selfishness . Maybe it 's part of the killer instinct . Unless you can stash away and bury thoughts of your greatest love , you can not sustain the kind of concentration that breaks most men trying to write a book over a three- or four-year period . I learned this barefoot on a screened-in veranda on Villa Murphy . Nothing on this planet existed but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even exist . I had no needs but food and sleep . I had no reason to live , except to create by writing . I ran the beach at sunup , thinking , talking to myself as I ran . " Hey , writer , how 's it go ? " I 'd wave and keep running . I would talk out my next day 's work to myself watching the sunset . And when the sun went down I drank hard . Once in a while the words would n't come . I 'd take a day off and Pierre and I went fishing and he taught me to sail . Sometimes loneliness would strike like the suddenness of the lightning storms . I would not permit the pain to overtake me . Things were starting to happen now that I had longed might happen when I was a little boy . When the electricity failed , I wrote by candlelight . When a hurricane wrecked part of the villa , I wrote from a room at the Eden Rock . I had reached a level of obsession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had fever . I wrote with hangovers . I wrote when some damned fine-looking women came prowling around . I had envisioned St. Barths as a hell island where I had to serve a sentence . Instead of imprisoning me , it liberated me in so many ways . I had learned that when the emotional starvation and lovelessness from parents during childhood , you have come to know a certain awesome splendor . Without it , you can not reach for eternity as a writer . Paying your dues to attain it becomes so frightening , so gutwrenching , it guarantees you years of sleeplessness and nightmares . I had to find it or never hope again . Every so often Tex dropped in in his stupid little Dutch STOL . For a time I expected divorce papers , but they never came . I filled my letters92 LEON URIS M I T L A PASS 93to the girls with happiness . One day I gave Tex the first draft screenplay to send to Schlosberg , and then I dared to start thinking about a novel . Christmas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over to St. Thomas to fetch them . With my screenplay on Judd Schlosberg'sdesk , I allowed myself to become excited , to reenter the world . St. Barths was n't forever , but I wanted my girls to know the place . We worked out St. Thomas as a rendezvous because Val 's family had a number of retired Navy friends there who could keep the girls till I arrived . We radioed ahead to get them packed and down to the airport . I was totally unprepared to see Val when we landed . I thought she would fly part of the way but expected she would vacation in Jamaica , which she loved as a girl . After an uproarious hello from the girls , Tex showed them around the plane and I went aside with Val . We shook hands and then I kissed her cheek . She did n't resist , or show any hostility . I had n't thought of her much . I had n't let myself . I had known my guilt was stuffed down and would erupt , but not till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe she was expecting me to look like a bearded , rum-soaked beachcomber . I was really tan and fit . " You look great , " she said . " Not much to do except stay healthy or go to seed . I . . . look  --  I did n't expect to see you , Val . Let me catch my breath . " " Sure . How 's the work coming ? " " I turned in the first draft screenplay a few weeks ago . I should be hearing soon . Sometimes it 's tough to get a message to me . Where are you heading , anyhow ? " " I 'm staying on St. Thomas . Mom is going to join me in a few days . " " Roxy wrote that she had a stroke . How is she doing ? " " Not too badly . This will be her first trip . She 's having a little trouble with  --  never mind . " " Well , you give her my love , will you ? " " Sure . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're dying to be with you . They 've missed their dad . " " I 've got a good time planned . I have a record player that works most of the time . I plan to run them through an opera and a symphony a day and I 've got a half-dozen books I want to read to them . Really hit it lucky . I 'm not working right now so we 'll do a lot of beaching and bust open lobsters . Do n't laugh but I even sail a little . " " You ? Sail ? I 'll bet you 're good . " " I 'm terrible . So , there 's a lot of kids their age . Everyone seems to get along with the language problem . They 'll have a good time . " I became a little uneasy and looked over to Tex . He gave me a high sign , " Anytime you 're ready , boss . " " We 'll be back on Friday , the second . I 'll try to radio ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you . No scuba diving for Penny . She can snorkel but the doctor said he did n't want any pressure on her head . " " Yeah . . . well , pleasant surprise seeing you . Have yourself a happy holiday and . . . look . . . would you be interested in taking a hop over and seeing how the other half lives ? Tex will run you back when your mom arrives . " " I 'd love to come over , " she whispered . " Better get in touch with the people you 're staying with ... " " I mentioned to them and to Mom that there was a chance in a thousand I might wind up in St. Barths . It 's fine with her . " " Well , then let 's go get you a bag packed . You do n't need much . " " It 's already packed . It 's in the terminal . Gideon , we 're going to be able to . .. " I put my arms about her and held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love affair with the island had started . I had pushed myself , beyond myself , out to a supernovacalled writer 's isolation . But for me , a horny little Jew , no place can be paradise without a woman . Now , it was paradise . The island conquered my girls as it had conquered me . " Where on earth did you find this record , Gideon ? " " In a back closet , all covered with dust . " " Seventy-eight RPM 's . . . holy cow . " " It 's the latest thing on St. Barths . " We danced on the veranda , so tightly . I saw you last night , And got that old feeling , When you came in sight , I got that old feeling , The moment you passed by , I felt a thrill , And when you caught my eye , My heart stood still , 94 LEON URIS I MITLA PASS 95Once again I seemed to feel That old yearning , And I knew the spark of love , Was still burning .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fast . " " That 's me , baby . Stick with me . I 'll take you over the rough spots . " " What did you say your name was ? " " Zadok , Gideon Zadok , and I 'm going to be a great writer someday . " With all the beauty and magic around us , there was still terrible unhealed pain between Val and me . We did n't talk about it much , but it was there . When people have inflicted such hurt on each other for so long a time , there must be scar tissue and bad dreams that will never go away . Were we strong enough , did we have the capability of love so powerful that we could endure black memories of the past , tuck them into a remote corner and never let them haunt us again ? Could Val and I make it to the end ? The moment I saw her , I knew I wanted to try . Tex returned in a week with the message that Judd Schlosberg had lined up radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , which administrated St. Earths , was a hundred miles or so to the south and was more in touch with the outside world . We could easily round-trip it in a day and it would be fun for the girls . Basse Terre had a bazaar to drive them crazy . I went to the shortwave radio center at the central post office . Oh , my , my , my ! Those exquisite words . " We love the script . We want to do the picture . " Schlosberg wanted a few weeks of changes , nothing major . Could I get back after New Year 's ? " I 'll be there . " End of transmission . I was halfway home ! Now , I dared dream openly of the novel . ON THE WESTERN end of St. Earths , Mount Vitet rose a thousand feet above the sea . Sometimes the jeep won the battle up the road , sometimes the road won . We had to climb the last half hour . We were both weary from welcoming in the New Year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us held a scattering of islands , little volcanic wonderments blasting up from the seabed millions of years ago . Val perched on a rock and crossed her legs and threw her head backto catch the breeze . The sweat shone off her face and neck and bosom . I unbuttoned her blouse . " God , they taste good sweaty . " She held my head to her . " You crazy . I 'm so happy we 're all going back together . " " Me too , " I said . " You 'll miss this place , Gideon . " " I was lucky to find it . God forbid I never come back . I was lucky . I 'd like to freeze time now , here . Val , you 're beautiful . " " Shucks , man , you 're going to make me cry . " You can make love to a hundred women , but no one feels like the woman who gave you your children . We sat for a long time hanging onto the last images . " Val , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago . A place called Twin Peaks in San Francisco . We were kids . I told her I was going to be a great writer someday and I read her the first chapter of a book I was going to write , someday . " " What happened to her ? " " We got married but we did n't live happily ever after . Along the way I got messed up . Then , I found an island called St. Earths and it taught me to go back and do what I was supposed to do in this world . I 'd rather come back here and live like a fisherman and write what I want to write . You know what I mean ? " " I 'm starting to understand what you 're about , Gideon . I 'd like to believe I can keep you but I do n't know . I have n't got a hell of a lot of confidence anymore . You 're a tough number to handle , buddy . You 've got a trillion volts running through you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the world who can ever really bring you peace . " " Val , I 'm sorry for what I did to you . " " I know that , Gideon . You do n't have to say it . " " I do have to say it . I 've got to hear myself saying it . " " I made you do a lot of things that drove you away . I 'm not all that clean , " she said . " We 've both done numbers on each other . Can we make it ? I wish I were more certain . " " I brought you up here because we started once on a hilltop . I know where I 'm heading . I 'll find out why , when I 'm there . I thought this would be the right place to tell you . " " Well , here we are , " she said shakily , afraid of what wild , crazy scheme I was going to come up with . " I 've never talked much about my childhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flashes on the horizon looked like heat lightning . Valerie blinked her eyes open . She recalled that when she was a little girl and the family was stationed on Guam , earthquakes and lightning storms were a common occurrence . It was the same kind of sounds and flashes as she heard now . She instinctively braced herself for the ground to start shaking but it did n't . Only the rumbles and flashes continued . Then she could hear faint popping sounds . Val flung off the sheet and fumbled for the lamp . It was nine o'clock at night . Wait , let me think . It all came back . Gideon had left early in the morning to go out on a raid with the Israelis . The day had dragged by torturously . Dr. Hartmann had come by to check on her again and given her a shot to settle her down . She had fallen into a deep sleep . " Mommy , come up to the roof , " Roxanne cried , running into the room . By the time they got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end of the Sharon Plain to the other . From their elevation they could make out a horizon being lit by cannon fire some seven or eight miles away . From here the sounds and sights seemed like a playland . The bombardment went on incessantly . Nearly an hour passed before any of them moved or spoke . " Is Daddy there ? " Penny asked . " Yes . " HERZLIA , ISRAELOctober 11 , 195696 LEON URIS " I know . Sometimes I wondered if you ever had a childhood . It 's been like a wall around you . " " You know how it is . You spend the second half of your life getting over the first half , " I said . " There are doors I 'm opening a crack , one by one . I opened a door marked , ' Danger , Tarawa and Guadalcanal , enter at your own risk . ' " " I think I understand , " she said . " There 's a big , fucking iron vault door inside me . It 's marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . I do n't know what the hell I 'm going to find in there . You remember me talking about my Uncle Matti ? " " Just a little . He 's the one who went to Palestine . Hero . Killed in the Arab riots of 1939 . That 's about all I know , " she said . " That 's about all I know , too . But I sense something dynamic happening . I sensed it the moment I opened the vault a crack . I  --  I want to go to Israel and find out . I 'm not totally sure why but it 's magnetic , pulling me . It 's like the Old Man upstairs , " I said pointing to the sky . " He 's telling me to go . It 's an instinct I have to follow . I denied I was a Jew several times in my life . It 's been around my neck like an albatross all my life . I 've got to free myself and I believe there may be a great book just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed a little . " You take the cake , old buddy . " " We can make it if we lease the house and you move down with your mom . The way I figure it , it 's going to take about six months to research . If I think it 's going to go longer , or if I decide to write the book there , I 'd want you and the girls to come to Israel . It 's going to be tight , but if we count our pennies we can hack it . " Val stared at me for ever so long . She was on the brink of tears . She had no illusions but that we were in for a long , terrible struggle . " You wo n't settle for less , will you ? You 've got to win . " " I 'm afraid so . " " You son of a bitch , " she whispered . " Val , if you ca n't or do n't want to handle it , let 's say goodbye now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Maybe . " " Gideon , I 'll keep up with you as long as I can . You go with my love . I 'll wait for you to send for us. " 98 LEON URIS  --  WhY ?  --   --  " He 's looking for something , " Val answered . Roxanne began to cry . Her mother held her tightly . " Daddy always makes it home , " Val said . WHAT G I D E O N HAD not anticipated was the speed with which the raid was executed . There was no dusting off a stack of old contingency plans , nor was there a surplus of battle-ready troops standing by . A dangerous target had been selected , one that would make all the necessarymilitary and political points to the Jordanians . The Jordanian policefort was just across the border , only twelve miles from downtown Tel Aviv , on the outskirts of Kalkilia , a city of twenty-five thousand inhabitants . During the day , elements of the Israeli Paratroop Brigade assembled from all parts of the country . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely tired . Yet they were the best availabletroops . The raid went well in the opening stages . There were no natural barriers to cross at the border and the forward units moved over easily . The Kalkilia police fort was illuminated by Israeli searchlights from two miles ' distance and support artillery fire opened up from a tank detachment . In the normal flow of battle something always went awry . The plan sprang leaks and all hell broke loose . The sky stayed lit with cannon bursts until 0300 but small arms fire could be heard until daybreak . Val and the girls had slept in fits and snatches . It was six in the morning when Val spotted Mr. Zimmerman , an assistant manager from the hotel , wheel his bicycle up the path toward the cottage . She was too terrified to move . Mr. Zimmerman was a friendly old codger . He delighted in running messages to the Zadok cottage in exchange for a few words of gossip . Val had seen a concentration camp number tattooed on his arm  --  one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly for several nights and understood so much about Israel in that single incident . " I just got a telephone call from Mr. Zadok , " he said . " He said to tell you he is all right and he would be home in a few hours . " Val screamed and collapsed against him . " Mr. Zadok was on the raid last night ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Oy , mein got . Sit down , Mrs. Zadok , please sit . I make you a glasstea . Oh , it was a very bad one . We had almost a hundred boys casualties . Nu , what can we do ? Thanks got Mr. Zadok was n't hurt . " The terrible wait was done . Val brought herself under control with the help of a wallop of that awful brandy . As color returned to her cheeks she managed a smile . " Bad news , I 'm afraid , " Mr. Zimmerman said . " We 're closing the hotel down . If Mr. Zadok will come to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side entrance and show him the fuse box for his room . We want he should keep his office . " When Mr. Zimmerman left Val rushed around the kitchen trying to find something to bake , something to clean , something to defrost . Strangely , as if they knew , the neighbors began to gather . THE GIRLS ran toward the jeep and flung their arms about him . " Better not touch me , " Gideon said , " I 'm all stinky . " He was , in fact , putrid . His eyes seemed far away , still reflecting a recent horror . He plopped down at the kitchen table . Val served him some cake and juice and shooed the neighbors out . He was too exhaustedto chew . Gideon pulled himself up and swayed down the hall to the bedroom , made it to the edge of the bed , doubled over and held his face in his hands . " Dad 's okay . He needs some rest , " Val said and closed the door . She wanted to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a naughty boy who had run out into the street and was pulled to the sidewalk by a mother who first kissed him , then slapped him . He did n't have to put them through this . Val was unable to temper her anger . " Well , I suppose you finally got to feel it , " she said . She really had n't wanted to say that . It just came out . " Well , I felt it too , " she went on acidly . " Okay , I deserve to be kicked in the ass , " he mumbled . " They 've closed down the hotel , " she continued , wanting to hit him with bad news . " Ca n't it wait ! " he snapped . " Sure , it can wait . " " I better take a shower and try to get some sleep . " He fumbled for the buttons of his combat jacket but his fingers would not function . There was a period of quiet , long enough for the venom to pass from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor before him and rested her head on his lap . " Simon was killed . So was Ben Dror . Zev lost both of his legs . " 100 L E O N U R I S 1 M I T L A PASS 101 " Oh Christ , " Val sobbed . " It was a real fuck-up . " " Oh , honey , honey , " she cried . " Poor Shalimit . She 's going to have a baby . . . oh , honey . I 'd better go see her . " " I saw her along with the battalion commander , this morning . " " God dammit , " Val cried . . . . " Oh , honey . . . oh , damn . " She got to her feet and stood over him and tousled his hair . It was sticky . " You 're a real mess , buddy , " she wept . " I 'll clean up . " Alpha Company of the Lion 's Battalion was sent out to bypass the fort . They set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalkilia in the event the Jordanians tried to reinforce the fort . It took longer to capture and blow up the fort than expected . With the timetable fucked , the battle plan went out the window . It was just like at Tarawa when the first wave of Marines failed to reach their objective . Officers and men in little groups had to improvise . The Jordanians sent a unit of the Arab Legion toward Kalkilia but did not play sucker or fall for the ambush . They went off the road , encircled Alpha Company , and had them trapped . Only after the balance of the Lion 's Battalion retreated for the border did they realize that Alpha Company was surrounded by the Legion and being chopped to pieces . The rest of the night turned into a frantic effort to break the encirclement . It turned into a bloody mess . Infantry , artillery , tanks and , later , planes had to try to open a hole . The Arab Legion hung tough when they realized they could annihilate an entire Israeli company . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic , this would make Jordan and King Hussein a more dangerous and adventurous foe . About dawn some Israeli tanks and half-tracks broke through to Alpha Company . The dead and wounded were loaded on . Some of the dead were tied to the tanks . Alpha Company did make it back but twenty-eight boys had been killed and thirty-five wounded . The Israeli raid succeeded but it was a terrible toll for a small country where everyone knew everyone . Val pushed Gideon 's chest gently and made him lie down on the bed , then unlaced his boots and tugged them off and unbuttoned his cloth- ing  --  " Golly , I have n't undressed you like this for years . Remember when you were writing your first book ? The girls would n't fall asleep until they heard your typewriter . You 'd come home from work and go up to the attic and write till two or three in the morning . I 'd come up after you , but you 'd be so tired you could n't make it down the stairs by yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugged him out of his clothing . " Help me to the shower , baby . " " Just lie back , " Val said , " just lie back . " Valerie pulled her blouse over her head slowly and unsnapped her bra and wiggled out of her jeans and stood over him . " What a time to be looking at tits , " he said . " I 'm a goddam animal . " Valerie lay on top of him , covering him . " It 's so crazy . They 're dead . But I want you . " She wrapped herself around him as best she could , blotting up his sweat with her body , kissing and licking the grit and dirt from his eyes and cheeks , rubbing her hair into the circles of sweat staining his neck , gripping him with her legs . " Fly away , buddy , " she said , " fly away . " IT Han BEEN a sticky wicket from the beginning . When Gideon first arrived in Israel , he promised the Israelis that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to them . In exchange the Israelis agreed to give him the help he needed to research his book . Rich Cromwell , the American CIA station chief , badgered Gideon for information from time to time , without success . Gideon knew that withoutearning the deep trust of the Israelis , he would never get the informationhe needed to write the novel he wanted . The call for a luncheon date at Cromwell 's Ramat Aviv villa carried an unmistakable sound of urgency . Gideon never failed to marvel at the lack of discomfort American Embassy personnel " survived " in . Now , take the huge silver bowl in Cromwell 's foyer . It brimmed over with petite calling cards , in the language of the caller and in French . Israel was a tiny country insofar as the number of embassies , legations , and consulates was concerned . Yet , when one figured that each country had an ambassador , first secretary , second secretaries , charge d'affaires , military attaches , cultural attaches , economic attaches , specialmissions such as the Point Four program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting scholars in endless conferences to produce endless wisdom , and Jewish philanthropists , investors , orchestras , dance troupes , and everyone received a welcoming and departing cocktail party , that was a lot of caviar and crackers . Then there was the102 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 103Fourth of July , Bastille Day , and the Queen 's birthday , and every countryhad a national holiday , particularly the newly liberated African nations ( the Africans really threw bashes ) , and because every legation bought everything duty-free , livers collapsed like sand castles at high tide . Everyone had a big silver or cut glass bowl or native basketweave in their foyer , and everyone coming for a visit left a petite calling card , in two languages . One could reasonably count on a minimum of twelve hundred and sixty-one cocktail parties a year . Rich Cromwell looked like a semi-rumpled , silver-haired old Yalie , which he was , who would be far more at home in a blue blazer on Cape Cod . Two-letter man , old Rich , hockey and lacrosse . A middling State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his inheritance , he rose no higher than a consul general post in Peru . He drifted to the CIA for a more fulfilling way of life . Cromwell knew of Gideon 's lust for prime rib and plumped him up at lunch to a fare-thee-well . When the amenities were done , Rich generally switched on his " sincere " mode . This afternoon he passed right over sincere and went directly to grim . Gideon sipped on his after-lunch Scotch slowly , lest he have a violent reaction to his sudden reexposure to it . " What happened on the Kalkilia raid ? " Rich began . " Now , how in the hell should I know ? " " Come on , Gideon . This would make you the only one in the country who did n't know where you were on the night of the tenth . Your buddy Simon Galt got hit by a stray bullet . He was standing right next to you . " " What are you on my case for , Rich ? You 've been briefed , rebriefed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the papers . It was a military operation . Some things went right . Some things went wrong . " " We all know about your arrangement with the Israelis and we 've respected it . " " However , " Gideon said . " However , it 's getting down to the short strokes . " " And ? " " You 're a Marine , Gideon . " Oh balls , he 's going to Semper-Fi me , Gideon thought . Old Cromwell had been a Marine major , not too high a rank , not too low . Just right for a mediocre Yalie . " Rich , " Gideon said , " I know we shared the big war together , thewar to end all wars , you as a major and me as a PFC . So here it is , as one old buck-assed gyrene to another . I do n't know doodly shit . " Gideon sensed that hardball time was coming up . Rich needed some intelligence , badly . " Do n't be so modest , Gideon . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower does . Your pals read like Who 's Who . You chum around with Teddy Kollek , Moshe Pearlman , Beham , Jackie Herzog . . . " " This may be difficult for you to comprehend , but they do n't rush out of cabinet meetings to brief me . " Cromwell did n't believe him . He digested his frustration and decided to take a bold step . " I 'm going to level with you , " he said . " This place is about to blow up . You may have it within your power to help prevent a catastrophe . " " I 'm listening , " Gideon answered quietly . " I 'm going to give you a scenario , a secret scenario . Maybe you can fill in some of the blank spots . " Careful , Gideon said to himself , careful . " Dayan , Golda , Peres , and Moshe Cannel flew to Paris a few weeks back . " " What 's so earthshaking about that ? France is Israel 's major supporterand supplier , " Gideon answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bizerte in a reconverted French bomber to avoid all civilian airports . Now , I 'm talking about Israel 's Foreign Minister , Transportation Minister , Chief of Staff , and Peres , the architect of the French connection . They met at the home , not the office , of Louis Mangin in Montparnasse , " Cromwell went on . " On the French side were Foreign Minister Pineau , Defense Minister Bourges-Maunoury , Director General of the Defense Ministry Abel Thomas , and Chief of Staff Eli with four of his closest aides . " Gideon managed to listen without expression . " France and Britain want the Suez Canal back , right ? " Cromwell said . " I suppose so . " " Israel 's interest is getting Nasser 's troops out of the Sinai , opening the Red Sea to their shipping , and stopping the terrorist attacks from the Gaza Strip . Now , let 's make an educated guess what these people were discussing . " " I do n't know that this meeting even took place , Rich . I know you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against Egypt , " Rich said. 104 LEON URIS , MITLA PASS 105 " Hell , it could be . From the looks of it , Jordan seems to he the target . " " A decoy , " Rich said . " We think Jordan is a decoy and we take umbrage that two of America 's closest allies are planning a military action without consulting us . " " It 's all over my head , Rich . " " Here it is , Gideon , straight and unvarnished . You 're an American . You can get us the answers to a couple of very frustrating questions . We think the British and French are n't consulting us because they 're afraid we 'd stop them . " Gideon popped out of his chair , tipped the Scotch bottle into his glass , and considered Cromwell 's theory . " Why is it in America 's inter- est to stop two of her allies from taking back an international waterway vital to the West and why is it in our interest to keep the Suez Canal and Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't follow you . " Cromwell had succeeded in the first step , getting Zadok to discuss the matter . " The instant England and France make a hostile move against Egypt , the Soviet Union is going to plunge headlong into the Middle East to play hero to the Arabs . We do n't want Russia in here any deeper . It 's Egypt 's canal . Nasser owns it . We do n't give a big rat 's ass if England and France do n't get it back . Are you starting to get the drift of America 's interest ? " Gideon gave a noncommittal gesture . " What happens when the Kremlin advises the British and French that five hundred Russian missiles are trained on Paris and London and are going to be fired if they set foot in Egypt ? Who 's going to get to clean this mess up ? I 'm talking about the probability of a Soviet-Amen- can confrontation . Eisenhower does not want to go to war over the Suez Canal , nor do we want the Russians arming every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me ask you one more time . Are Israel , France , and England planning an attack on Egypt ? Yes , or no ? " " I do n't know , " Gideon rasped . " I think you 're a liar . " " I do n't know . How could I know ? " " I do n't want to be crude but you 've got a lady friend in the Prime Minister 's office who translates all the top-secret documents into He- brew . Everybody in Israel knows that Natasha Solomon is your mis- tress . In fact , you did n't make much of an effort to cover it until your family arrived . " Gideon sat again and fidgeted uncomfortably . " You could find out if you wanted to , " Cromwell pressed . " Natasha would n't tell me . No way she would tell me . " " All right , Gideon , sit on this one . Israel is going to mobilize . She 's calling up the reserves the day after tomorrow . " The thunder of Cromwell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Val . The girls . Ruined ! Everything 's ruined ! " I personally like you , " Cromwell said . " You might need me to help you get your family out of here . Things could get very tight . " " Mind if I have another drink ? " " Help yourself . " Cromwell jotted a number on a slip of paper and handed it to Gideon . " Private line . It 's scrambled so you can talk freely . However , you make your calls from a pay phone . Keep in touch every day and let me know if you have anything to tell me . " Gideon scarcely heard him . He slipped the note into his pocket , his head reeling , trying to find a way , any way to salvage the wreckage . EVACUATION October 27 , 1956AN UNSEEN HAND swept over the land of Israel gathering up men from the fields and shops , from the offices and factories . A Hebrew code word spoken at news time over the radio sent men of a particular reserve unit scurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet , packed a bit of food , took their own winter coats and blankets , kissed the family goodbye , and headed quickly and quietly to the bus stop or hitched a ride . Units assembled in predestined secret places , a clump of woods , a kibbutz or moshav , or someplace away from the probing eyes across the border . It all took place in a silent , ethereal way without histrionics . Most of the reserve units were then moved into defensive positions along the border , freeing the standing army to go into the attack . Transport was gleaned from city streets and highways . Vehicles were stopped at roadblocks , checked off a list , and the driver given a receipt for his confiscated car or truck . He continued on by hitching a ride . A good part of the bus system left the streets and highways to staging areas for the motor pools . This was an army of poorly equipped militia which had to travel on the shaky wheels of aged buses , laundry vans , flatbed and stake trucks , ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the land and reviewed the emergency plans to keep vital services going with volunteer skeleton crews . This was the role of the older citizens . While the reservists were away the water had to keep running , the electricity humming , the schools and hospitals functioning , food supplies moving from farm to city . The entire country moved in this ominous , silent , deadly rhythm . AFTER LUNCH Gideon drove the jeep into Tel Aviv where Moshe Pearlman , a reserve colonel in the Prime Minister 's office had commandeeredspace over an auto agency and was in the process of converting it into the military press , censorship , and spokesman 's office . It was alive with activity , laying in as many new telex lines as possible . Gideon 's literary agent in New York had again failed to come up with assignments , so he sent a dozen telex messages on his own to the newspapersyndicates asking for work . From there , Gideon drove to the defense complex and turned in his jeep for the duration , then hitched a ride back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting blackout paper over the window . In their neighborhood , mostly consisting of South African Jews , the men had simply disappeared . " You and Mr. Zimmerman seem to be the only men left , " Val said . " What do you think , hon ? Is it going to blow over ? " Apparently the CIA did n't think so . Gideon shrugged . " I 'm not worried , " he lied . Gideon kept a typewriter at home and took a whirl at writing . After a dozen crumpled pages hit the trash can he gave up . " Switchboard at the hotel is shut down , " he said . " I 'm going to run over to the village and make a few phone calls . " As he jogged toward the village center , Gideon 's mind went strangely to something other than the call-up of the reserves and the deterioratingsituation . He was thinking of his meeting with Rich Cromwell and particularly the stinging words about him and Natasha Solomon . Back home in L.A. , Gideon had always managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He controlled them from start to finish , never crossing a certain line of involvement , always pulling out before it became too serious . " You 're a rotten bastard , Gideon , " a young actress had told him . " You deliberately make a girl fall in love with you then you let herdown , always the gentleman . And you run home and pull the drawbridgesup . " Gideon had arrived in Israel determined to stay clean . Israel , he discovered , was quite sophisticated about bed hopping , General Dayan being the most prolific lecher in the country . Even Ben-Gurion was rumored to have a mistress , now and again . Well , he had n't planned to fall in love with Natasha , but he did . For the first time in his life , he went out of control for a woman . There was excitement , madness , daring exceeding anything he had dreamed of . Here was a woman who could match him , make him do what he had made other women do . These were arms he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew jealous anger and went into rages for the first time . He behaved , at times , in a manner he had disdained in other men . Rich Cromwell said everyone in the country knew . Did Valerie know as well ? She never let on that she did . Had some bitch made a sly inference at a cocktail party ? Had Natasha herself let Val know obliquely by being overly sweet and patronizing ? After all , it was n't a state secret , only delicious gossip . Val had come to Israel , done her best , loved him hard . She did n't deserve another humiliation . He wanted to leave Natasha . He tried , really tried . Each time he tried they ended up in a wilder reunion . This was a sweet moment in his life he would never know again . He did n't have the strength or the real desire to walk away . GIDEON PULLED up panting at a tiny corner cafe where Mrs. Mandel greeted him . He opened the soft-drink cooler . No ice . " The ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my Harry . I 'm closing down until this thing is over with . " Gideon unsnapped and slowly drank a soft-drink concoction . Satisfiedno one else was around , he went to the wall phone and dialed Rich Cromwell 's private number . " Hello . " " Hi . This is your old gyrene buddy . " " Anything we should get together on ? " Rich asked . " No , no new information . Just checking in . " " I 'm glad you did . We 're calling for the evacuation of all Americans . " Sweat streaked from Gideon 's forehead into his eyes . He wiped it buthe stung from the salt . Keep your head , he said to himself . He sippedthe soft drink to moisten his dry mouth so he could speak . " When 's this going to happen ? " he asked shakily. 108 LEON URIS 1 MITLA PASS 109 " Starting tonight . We 're flying over some transport from the RhineMainbase in Germany . They 're already en route . Embassy , consulate , missions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Otherwise , a destroyer is on the way to Haifa to take out civilians working here and tourists . That might take a couple of days . " " Holy shit . " " Planes are due in around ten or eleven tonight . Get your family to the airport . I 'll see that they get on tonight . Otherwise , it might be a Chinese fire drill . " " I do n't know . . . " Gideon mumbled . " This is n't coming through as a request , Gideon . It 's orders . Eisenhoweris pissed . P-I-S-S-E-D . If you stay , you 're on your own and you could run into some real problems . " " How about my dog ? " Gideon said for no reason . " I do n't think so . Look , got to run . Get to Lydda by nine o'clock and look me up . " The line went dead . GIDEON STRIPPED OFF his shorts and shirt and stood under the cold outdoor shower for a short eternity hoping the water would suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist and walked toward the cottage as though it were his last mile . " Hi , baby , where are the kids ? " " Playing with the Ben Josephs . " Val turned from the sink and saw him . He was ashen . " You should n't run in this heat , " she said . He averted her stare , went to the fridge , and devoured another bottle of soda pop . " I just talked to Cromwell , " he whispered . " Sorry , honey , I ca n't hear you . " Val turned off the faucets and wiped her hands . " What did you say ? " " I said , I talked to Cromwell . Val , we 've been ordered to evacuate . " It did n't register . " Evacuate ? Where , how , when ? Is this part of some kind of maneuvers ? " " It 's not maneuvers . We 've been ordered to evacuate the country . " Val was horror-stricken . She uttered a little peep and gripped the sink to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head lowered , his eyes on the aggregate floor studying the designs abstractedly . He looked up slowly . She was over him . " Where ? When ? " " Tonight . Probably someplace in Europe . Planes are on the way from Germany . " She appealed to him with her eyes . " Please tell me it 's a bad joke , " she was trying to say . He shrugged . " We do n't have to go , " Gideon said . " What kind of crazy business is this ! " " There seems to be a lot of spite involved . Eisenhower is furious with Israel . Jerking the embassy people out like this seems to be more of a warning than anything . " " What do you think ? " " I do n't think we 're in any danger , but it 's something I do n't want to be wrong about . What really disturbs me is how this must all sound over the news at home . I guess I 'm thinking about your mother and my old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls getting hurt , we ca n't take it . " " You 're right , it would kill Mom on top of her stroke , " Val said slowly , allowing reality to take over her fright . " Settled , then . Better start packing up for you and the girls . " " What about you ? " Gideon shook his head . " There 's no way I can leave . " " Why ? " she asked . It was a devastating , all-encompassing , " WHY . " " I ca n't , you know I ca n't . I 'm . . . " " You 're what ! " " I 'm a Jew . . . I represented myself here as a fighter . . . a Marine . . . Of Men in Battle is their second bible . . . . I ca n't tuck my tail between my legs and jump ship with the women and children . It would n't sit right . " " To whom would n't it sit right ? " " To myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word I wrote in my book ? " " Fuck your book ! " Val yelled . " Whatever you say , whatever you think , is right . I 've messed up , in spades . Even if I could make myself believe it was morally right to leave , we still have problems . We 've got to salvage something out of this . You 're only going to be able to take a couple of suitcases . " " Do n't give me that shit , Gideon ! Your pals can pack and ship the rest of the stuff . " " Baby , we are broke . I mean dead-ass busted . I 've got to try to get some of the lease money back . Maybe , if I can sell the car to a foreigner on a passport-to-passport deal , I can raise a few thousand dollars . We 've got three thousand in Israeli currency in the bank . It 's going to take some real manipulation to get it converted . " 110 L E O N U R I S M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just leave , " she cried . He did n't hear her . She did n't hear him . " I 've got a dozen cables to get on the wire . I 've got to pick up some writing assignments , " he mumbled . " Let 's just go ! " " We 've barely got hotel money for you in Europe . " And then they stopped their soliloquies and stared at each other . " What about the rest of it , Gideon ? Are you going to find the hottest combat unit in Israel and wing it out with them ? " No more needed to be said . The confrontation was spoken with eyes . What about Natasha Solomon ? Val accepted the reality as though the life had been squeezed from her body . " What about Grover ? " she asked , barely speaking . " He 's sick . " " I was told I could n't get him on the plane . I 'll take him in to Dr. Klement and do everything I can to bring him out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a good home . " Val looked around desperately as though she were waiting for the hypnotist to clap his hands and wake her from her nightmare . The girls were standing in the doorway , gaping in disbelief . " How much did you hear ? " " We have to leave , " Penny said . " Go to your room and lay out only the most essential things on the bed , " Valerie said with sudden firmness . " Dad will send everything to us later . " " Grover ! " " I 'll do everything I can to get him to you as soon as he 's well . " Roxy broke and wept . " Roxanne , " Valerie said sternly , " we 've got to tough it , so pull yourselftogether , girl . There 's a long night ahead . " " Yes , Momma ... " EACH ITEM of clothing was rolled up tightly and jammed down into a pair of Gideon 's Marine Corps seabags . It was amazing how much they were able to pack in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went into combat they would wind a roll of toilet paper around a pencil and keep stretching it tighter so that five or six rolls could be compressed into a few inches in diameter . The six o'clock news came on , with a chilling announcement that ablackout was now in effect . It was Grover Vandover who picked up on the growing tension as neighbors arrived , but the dog was feeling too low to protest with much more than a whimper . Some of the neighbors brought dollars from their hidden stashes and exchanged them for Israeli currency to help the Zadoks . Everyone gave Val a letter to be mailed to South Africa or elsewhere when she was out of the country . Farewell embraces as Gideon finished painting the headlightsof the car to comply with the blackout . He muscled the seabags into the trunk just as the sun set . The four of them were suddenly standing by the Ford , looking at the cottage . They had barely settled in and it was over with . As they closed the doors , the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last-minute reprieve might save them , then he switched on the engine . The car probed into a suddenly blackened countryside , bypassing a Tel Aviv that no longer seemed to be there . He had taken the route a hundred times on the way to Jerusalem but never in darkness . Gideon gripped the wheel tightly and strained to pick up any little familiar landmarks . The car suddenly banged into something and bucked hard . He had driven up and over a curb . A few minutes later they went off the shoulder of the road and barely missed sinking into a ditch . Val drove them out while Gideon pushed . Good . A familiar straight road for a while . Val took the Uzi gun off her lap , set it on the floor , and wrote a list of things he had to do . The girls forced their way through The Little Brown Song Book . There was once a man With a double chinWho performed with skillOn the violin , And he play 'd in time , And he played in tune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Zip CoonHe played all day , Until he drove his friends away ; He played all nightBy the light of the moon , And he would n't play anythingBut Old Zip Coon. 112 L E O N U R I S MITLA PASS 113Gideon slammed the brakes on . Jesus ! He had almost dead-centered a donkey and cart . Fierce words were exchanged in Hebrew and English . No one understood the other . " Come on back in the car , honey . We have n't got time to get into a fight now , " she said . " Shmuck ! " Just a song at twilight , When the lights are low , And the flick ' ring shadows Softly come and go . He inched to a stop , apparently lost . Dammit ! Seemed to be an intersectionahead . He walked up and found the road signs . Blessed relief . Lydda Airport-4km . They were passed through the security gate and reached the parking lot just before nine o'clock , coming upon an eerie scene . The main lounge of the aged terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place was lit by candle and lantern light casting a yellowishglow over piles of hastily packed suitcases and confused , disorganizedhumanity . Talk was in whispers , as though an enemy were listening . No one seemed to know anything . Gideon carved out a place for Val and the girls and set out to find Rich Cromwell . He located him up in the tower . He flashed a false credential , one of a half dozen he carried , and shoved his way into the control room . The confusion there seemed as rampant as it was in the terminal . There had been word of American evacuation plans and a lot of unidentified blips were spooking the radar screens . The situation was worsened by the standoff between the Americans and Israelis . The Americans wanted no cooperation , not even data from Israeli patrol planes . " Hi , Rich , how 's it going ?

I 'll hunt you down in a while ; I want to talk to you . " Gideon had been leery of the special treatment . He was certain that Cromwell was going to have one more crack at him for intelligence data . He did n't like it . Val had used her wits , packing a deck of cards , some jacks and a ball , and mini-chess and cribbage boards . She also had thrown together some sandwiches and fruit . The latter proved inspirational as the cafeteria had been stripped down to the last crust of bread . The air grew thick from too many people and too much cigarette smoke .

" " There are a lot of planes out there making sure the skies are safe . It 's going to be a while before we know the rights and wrongs of this thing . But you 've got to be proud you 're an American . Why , your country thinks so much about one little girl , they 're coming from thousands of miles away to take you to safety .

Val and Gideon were wordless , their thoughts jumbled and disconnected . Val 's hair had become disheveled and her eyes listless . She was unaware of Gideon 's patting her . Her mind was on the list . Did I put a note for him to cancel my hair appointment ? Not to bother , the hairdresser is in a reserve unit . . . did I pack Penelope 's medication . . . sure I did , I must have . . . the minute we land I 'll find the nearest U.S. Naval facility and they 'll get a message through to Mom ... 114 L E O N U R I S M I T L A PASS 115She studied him in the low light .

That 's all she needs now , a rah-rah Zadok speech from me . Val , I 'll make it up to you . I swear it .. . Wordless , numb . One o'clock . Rich Cromwell tapped Gideon on the arm and signaled for him to follow . They went into a side office . Gideon looked at the assemblage .

" " We 've got a message the Egyptian fighter planes are off the coast , " Rich said . " If I knew , " Gideon snarled , " do you think I 'd let my wife and daughters fly into them ? " Cromwell 's nerve snapped . " You God-damned Jews had better get this question settled of whether you 're Americans or not ! " His pinkish cheeks turned crimson as their little red veins bulged . He shook his finger at Gideon menacingly . " Now listen , Jew boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us right . " " Go fuck yourself , you rumheaded cunt .

" Gideon asked . " We 've got some unidentified blips . The Israelis are up patrolling . We 'll know soon . We 're not supposed to be cooperating with them , but we 're bending the rules . " " Sorry about what I said , " Rich said . " I 'd like it better if you did n't believe what you told me , " Gideon answered , and left . ONE-FORTY A.M.

They 're landing ! Six awkward-looking C-119 Flying Boxcars were followed in by three Globemaster C-124s , opening their jaws to swallow up the refugees . Gideon carried Penelope while Valerie guided a staggering Roxanne to the outside where they were counted off . He went back and returned with the seabags . An airman assisted them up the ramp . Val , Penny , and Roxanne were buckled in on folding canvas seats , twenty to a side . The airman tapped Gideon on the shoulder , indicating it was time to leave . " Happy landing , baby , " Gideon said . Val just nodded . Gideon started down the ramp . " Gideon ! " she called . He turned . " I love you , " she said . For some reason people had become uncomfortable with all the Israelicoins in their pockets which they could n't spend anyhow . A bucket was passed around and soon it was half filled . An airman handed it to Gideon on the tarmac . In a moment the ramp was pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut . Runway lights shot on long enough for the planes to push skyward and disappear .

His most urgent business was to get the animal into Tel Aviv to the vet . " Come on , buddy , let 's get some sleep , " he said to Grover . His bedroom was in disorder from the speed with which they had packed . The bed rumpled from her afternoon nap . He stared at it . It had been a good old bed . " I ca n't stay here , " he mumbled . He put Grover in the car and took the short drive to the Accadia Hotel . It loomed on its cliffside setting like the grim white elephant it had become . No abandoned Scottish castle was eerier , and it was made more so by the low muffle of the sea . Gideon opened a side door , put his fingers over the flashlight to cut its beam , and edged down to the basement to the fuse boxes .

Gideon snuggledbeside his dog on the couch but his eyes were wide open . He stared at a print on the wall as though he had never seen it before , then rolled to his feet , yawned his way to the desk , and poked through the mail . A letter from his father . Gideon stared at his father 's envelope . He opened it . My Dearest Son , My wits have come to an end . Ten days without so much as a line , a comma .

They have asked repeatedly to honor you with an evening but are feeling like so many shmattes ( rags ) and shnorrers ( beggars ) by your evasions that you are too busy . It would especially be good for Valerie and the girls to learn of their great cultural accomplishments and particularly so they should n't go around thinking that you are an elitist snob .. .

Gideon rolled up the wooden blinds and watched the sea outside as daylight came . He stood over the candles and worked up enough breath to blow them out , then wobbled to the couch .

" GIDEONMITLA PASSOctober 29 , 1956D DAY , H HOUR MINUS 40 MINUTESTHE FORMATION of Dakotas plodded deeper into the Sinai , crisscrossingthe paths of Moses . The sun made its final gesture , blinking behind the mountains . The cabin of our plane plunged into darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clashed with night air spilling down the mountains . As the formation reached a risky altitude of five hundred feet , fits of turbulence awakened even the deepest sleeper . Major Ben Asher , the Lions ' commander , waved his hand for Shlomo and me to come up front , where they were crammed in over the navigator'sdesk . I did a double take , staring at the pilot . I had n't noticed before , but the pilot was a woman . Ben Asher read the latest message and beamed . " Hello , writer , squeeze in . Everything looks good now . Our aircraft report no Egyptian air or troop movement along the entire Canal . They have n't got a camel 's ass of suspicion . " As Shlomo and I worked our way back to our seats , one by one the paras awoke , yawned , belched , smacked dry lips , fiddled with adjustmentson their gear , patted their weapons as though they were girls ' backsides , and chatted about the promising news .

Many wore kipis on their heads and had opened prayer books and bobbed and weaved , even though they could not read the words for the darkness. 120 LEON URIS M I T L A PASS 121I was suddenly struck by unadulterated , all-consuming terror . I felt my entire body locking up and feared that normal movement was gone . The perspiration salted my eyes and my lips turned into dry eroded cakes . I became afraid to breathe too deeply for I knew that when I exhaled I would whimper out loud . My heart pounded audibly as the plane climbed abruptly from under the Egyptian radar range to the jumping altitude . Shlomo 's hand gripped my arm . " You 'll be all right , " he whispered . " What 's the Hebrew word for Geronimo ? " I asked . " Geronimo ? " " That 's the American paras ' battle cry . Are n't we supposed to give a bloodcurdling yell as we jump ? " " Believe me , you 'll find something to scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the writer 's greatest reasons for being . What does a man fear most ? Being tortured ? Being locked in a ward filled with lunatics or a prison filled with rapists and murderers ? Add to these fears the fear of a surgeon 's knife . Some years back on a routine physical examination my doctor found a tumor in my chest , maybe the size of a baseball . It was lodged between my lung and aorta . A few days later I was in Denver unpacking a small suitcase at Rose Hospital , with surgery to commence after several days of tests . Val and I were separated at the time . We had to split every so often ; a week , two . We always got back together . I was in Denver with Georgia , a screwball divorcee who had been married to a musician , among others . Musicians , as we know , did much pioneering in the use of uncontrolled substances . Georgia was a very classy lady , one of the first female oil executives at that period . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . We were very comfortable with each other , never talked of marriage or heavy-duty commitments . When the tumor was found , I talked the doctor into letting me out of the hospital every night so I could cuddle in with Georgia . What the hell , the surgeon must have thought , the poor bastard is probably loaded with cancer , so why not ? The only drug of note going in those days was marijuana . New Wave stuff . Georgia had a lot of musician buddies and a source of pot . At first I thought it grew hair in your teeth or made you jump from tall buildings . There was a movie about it in the old days called Reefer Madness and it scared the hell out of me as a kid . Cancer ? So , why not a little marijuana ? I reverted to a lot of macho , Marine Corps bullshit . If I was going to die , I was going out with bravado . Every night I jumped the hospital and Georgia and I would get high and hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say Denver . It was still part cowboy town and knew how to take care of a fellow who had had a long dry spell on the dusty cow trails . Raunchy as it gets . The day before surgery I conned my way out of the hospital on the promise I 'd be back by early evening . So , who watches time ? Georgia and I always loved playing fantasy and we had pretty fertile minds . We made up a wish list and damned if she did n't go up on the runway at Jake Foxe 's , the local strip joint , on amateur night . And Georgia put on quite a show . I got off watching the guys at the front table and she got off watching me get off and damned if we did n't pick up another stripper  --  butthat 's another story . What has this morbid tale of lust and vulgarity to do with the resolutionof fear ? I recall the exact fraction of a second it happened . The three of us were crossing Colfax Avenue . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find more substance . As we were waiting for the signal lights to change , the thought of tomorrow 's surgery flashed through my mind . I said to myself , If I could magically change my condition and trade places with anyone in the world at this moment , who would it be ? Churchill ? Babe Ruth ? Clark Gable ? Who would I be ? The answer was Gideon Zadok . Facing an operation with less than a fifty-fifty chance of survival , I just wanted to be me . . . with a girl on each arm getting blasted and heading for a whorehouse motel . I was satisfied with what I had done with my life . . . won a big battle . . . written some very fine stuff . . . never compromised as a writer . I had remorse for my sins and tried to pay them off by being a good man . I faced the rotten side of me head-on . In sum , I was damned pleased with myself and I guess I was ready to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue for the lights to change my fear vanished . No regrets . What a wonderful way to go into an operating theater . Sometime after midnight and before dawn I returned to my hospital room . The anesthetist was in a rage . I confessed to the various ingredientsI had ingested . " You 've got some milkshake in you , Zadok . One more night like this and you wo n't need surgery . " 122 LEON URISThe operation was postponed until I was detoxed  --  with an armed guard on my door . But the main thing was  --  I was n't afraid ! I was n't afraid when they wheeled me through those moonshot sliding stainless steel doors . I was n't afraid as the anesthesia swept over me . . . " So long , world , it 's been a real slice . " The wind at the Dakota jump door jolted me . I stood at the edge . I was not afraid ! I hurtled out into space , then slowed . All about me chutes billowed open like a fleet of sailboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe even reverse my directionand float off into galaxies unknown . As the formation of Dakotas banked and raced back to Israel , their engines hushed and faded altogether . We were alone , far behind enemy lines . I became aware of the flapping of the chutes and little whumping noises that abruptly ended the short but magnificent odyssey . Real world below ! Laborious grunts , curses , sharply delivered commands . I had kept my legs in good shape over the years , if not my liver , but my knees had been trashed out from years of skiing and motorcycling . Most writers try to imitate the tough-guy image . Having neither the desire nor stomach to murder unarmed animals , I drifted away from my imitation Hemingway routine and let myself become Gideon Zadok , whatever he might be . But it had all come too late to save the knees . My feet barely brushed the ground when my body swung over like a pendulum and I whammed down hard on my right hip and was dragged along a stretch of ground . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought until I tried to move about . Although my hip was numbed from the blow , I was still able to wrestle with my chute and Shlomo was all over me getting me unharnessed . JESUS ! GOD ! I 'D DONE IT ! I FELT GREAT ! GIDEON ZADOK ! YOU 'RE GREAT ! GREAT ! GREAT ! When Shlomo and I hugged each other like reunited refugee brothers , I realized my celebration was premature . I collapsed in his arms , then fell to the ground . While Shlomo helped me test my leg , the battalion was engaged rapidly in the organized chaos that follows a night drop . Officers and NCOs snapped orders in Hebrew that were responded to with amazing speed and efficiency , considering the blackness . They gathered into units at a rendezvous point around Major Ben Asher . Shlomo assisted me as I hobbled to a medical tent where the injuredM I T L A PASS 123were being collected . There were a dozen of us , mostly sprains but a few serious injuries . Dr. Schwartz and a medic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballooning and darkening , but after a few excruciating tests the doctor felt there was no break or fracture . " What is it ? " " Nice , plump hematoma . You broke an artery that will collect a quart or so of blood . " " Prognosis ? " " It 's going to be painful for the first night but in three days or so you should be able to start moving around . " The doc lifted my shirt in search of further injuries and shook his head as he saw Natasha 's handiwork on my back . " What the hell did you land on ? A cactus ? " " Wound from a previous engagement , " I said . " Remain here with the injured , " he ordered and went to the next man . The officers gathered around Ben Asher as the Lions secured the landing . There was some argument and confusion among them . Apparentlywe had been dropped three miles off target . So far , shithouse luck . No response from the Egyptians , who we believedwere holed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard us come down . Ben Asher ordered his crack outfit , the Recon platoon , to move up close to the Pass and prevent any Egyptians from breaking out , then looked over the injured . The final tally was remarkablylow . We had assorted sprains and bruises and only two paratrooperswith broken legs . There was no way the injured could keep up with the rest of the battalion which had to force-march and dig in behind the Recon platoon . Two squads were left to guard us as the battalion moved out . There were to be continuous air drops of supplies during the night , including jeeps . If and when they arrived , the jeeps could move the I ' . injured up to battalion . A night of feverish activity lay ahead for the battalion to reach the proper site and set up defenses . The precise place was the Parker Monument , a stone near the eastern end of the Pass .

Oh shit , man , the pain was really coming on . I 'd been enough of a hero for one day . " Shlomo ? " " Yes ? " " It 's starting to hurt like hell , buddy . Soon as Doc Schwartz is free , maybe he can give me something . " " Something " turned out to be a shot of morphine . Merciful stuff . It took over in minutes .

I do n't know whether you mean to get a job as a hotel porter or a servant for a millionaire family or become a music hall entertainer or work in a nite club .

" We 'd better go home and get you warm , " Molly said . " No , " he answered , ' 7 want to finish the snowman . " " Come on , " she said , picking her brother up . His weight forced her to tilt for balance as she puffed through the snow , out of Fairmount Park to the sidewalk . She looked right and left for streetcars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue . She set Gideon down , took his hand and half dragged him up the four flights of stairs to their flat . Pain was setting in in the little boy 's extremities , and by the time they reached the door he was crying . The odor of frying liver and onions reached their nostrils as Molly opened the door . That meant two things . A payment had been made to the gas company and the stove and hot-water heater had been turned on . It also meant that Momma had given the butcher enough on account for her to make a purchase . When they fell too far in arrears , Momma would send Molly and Gideon to the grocer or butcher to play on their sympathies . Sometimes the butcher was feeding his own family on scraps but could n't stand the stares of children who were obviously hungry . " That child is not a well child , " Momma said . " You should n't have had him out in the park for so long . You should get a spanking . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Molly said , unbuttoning Gideon'sdripping jacket and laying it on the radiator . Momma went to the hotwaterheater and lit a match . The fire flared on with a whomp and a hiss . Oh boy , hot baths , Molly thought . She stripped her brother and bundled him in his big wool robe with the Indian teepee designs on it , closed ofthe alcove curtain and changed herself as well . As they waited for the water to heat up , Momma opened the icebox and gave each of them a slice of apple . Momma bought old fruit that was about to spoil from the pushcart vendor and could often pick up a half-dozen pieces for a nickel or a dime . Gideon ate shivering . They heard the slow , familiar steps of Nathan agonizing his way up the stairs . Nathan was Gideon 's daddy , but not Molly 's . She did not remember her own father . Nathan entered and , without greeting , set his dilapidated briefcase on the table . He was a small man , barely five feet tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinch of dismay . Gideon slipped off his chair and stood in front of his father and stared up at him until Nathan had to become aware of his son 's presence . " Daddy , I 'm cold , " the boy said. 128 LEON URISFor that moment , Nathan set aside his own misery , picked up his son , and held him on his lap . He rubbed warmth into the boy 's fingers and toes and wrapped his arms about him and rocked him back and forth tenderly . Nathan sang the words of a lullaby in Yiddish . The child was a little bird and should not be frightened , for his mother and father were guarding the nest . Gideon smiled and laid his head on his daddy 's chest and lingered . It was to be the lone memory of physical contact and affection from his father .

Nathan , the eldest , who had just turned ten , stood by the door for a moment and listened . He had heard his momma sing that song to six of his brothers and sisters . He did n't remember her ever singing to him . Maybe he was too young to remember . More likely , he thought , she never sang to him . Nathan was a small , frail child , often sick and endowed with a nature that was perpetually surly . He never seemed to engage in laughter . Not that there was that much for Jews to laugh about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstatic outbreaks of pure joy . Not a week passed without a wedding or bris or bar mitzvah . There were the holidays and the Sabbath as well , for happiness . But happiness eluded Nathan . Although his father , Yehuda , was considered part of the clergy , the132 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 133family was not nearly as fanatic in their observances as the ultra-Orthodoxand sects of Hasidim . Sophie had adamantly refused to shave her head and wear the traditional married woman 's wig when she wed her husband . Her defiance was considered a serious matter for a time , one that tested the wisdom of the rabbi and the elders . Wolkowysk was a small city , partly modernized and industrialized and not so isolated and therefore a bit more advanced in its thinking . Other girls , too , were rebelling against the iron dictates of rabbinical tyranny . Nathan was happy his mother had won because she had beautiful hair which she twisted into a large bun in the back of her head . When times became desperate , she would cut off some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell it to the wig shop . It always grew back , but each time it was a little grayer . In Wolkowysk the younger boys and girls were now allowed to dance with one another at celebrations . This was a very modern innovation . Nathan tried it a few times but he felt awkward and ashamed because the girls were always taller . He was afraid to touch them because he knew it could lead to trouble and he wondered why the boys in his class talked about girls so much . Did n't they all realize that the matchmakers were on the prowl , watching the children from an early age for a likely shiddach a few years down the line ? If an arrangement were made for Nathan he could end up just like his mother and father , doomed to a life of poverty and fear . He would do better . He 'd escape the Pale one day and become wealthy . Then all of the family would have to come to him and bow before him . He would be kind and generous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would be his delicious revenge . He would be nice to Momma but quite stern with his father . As for his brothers , he 'd make them crawl . This was Nathan 's great dream . His sisters would come humbly before him and beg him to put up a large dowry so they would be able to capture an important husband . Oh , the power he would exert ! Nathan stood over the cradle and poked his finger in the baby 's stomach , ostensibly to draw a smile , but he was too rough and Reuben screamed his displeasure . Sophie slapped Nathan 's hand and admonishedhim to do his chores . He backed away from the crib wondering how many more babies they were going to have . Nathan carried two buckets of water in from the pump , wobbling under the weight of the yoke , then gathered wood from the shed and stoked up the stove , which was both hearthstone and slave master of the house . Today was window-washing day . Where were his brothers Mordechai and Matthias ? Probably playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nathan did n't like to play the games . He was afraid of getting roughed up . That damned Mordechai knew how to avoid his chores , and when things were n't done Poppa always blamed Nathan , often with a clout to the ear . Mordechai , who was a year younger , was the bright scholar , the apple of Yehuda Zadok 's eye . Even now , with Nathan earning a ruble a week as a runner for the savings and loan office after school , Mordechai did n't have to fill in with chores at home . Nathan often fantasized punching Mordechai half to death , but his brother was larger than he and very mean . There were big celebrations when sons were born , but Nathan liked it better when he had a new sister . The girls did n't get so much attention and at least they grew up knowing how to work . Rifka , Sarah , and even little Ida always had busy hands . Sophie preparedthem to be homemakers almost as soon as they could walk . Beforethe daughters came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candles ; sweeping and scrubbing and washing and ironing ; mending and dressmaking ; bearing children and nursing and mothering ; keeping the vegetable plot and running a kosher home . Sophie was a splendid balabosta . How she managed to make ends meet was through incredible manipulation . And she taught her girls , early and well . Nathan frankly preferred his sisters for another reason . As a male , he was allowed to boss them around . YE H U D A Z A D OK was the shohet of Wolkowysk , the ritual slaughterer of chickens , an ancient profession first dictated in the Book of Deuteronomy . Each chicken was accorded a brief benediction , then dispatched quickly and with the least amount of pain and in a manner to assure they were kosher . The tool of his trade was a ten-inch knife with a blunted end . He had a half dozen of these , made of the finest German steel and honed to exquisite sharpness . Yehuda kept them in hand-tooled leather cases which he carried in a little black bag along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young he enjoyed going with his father to the slaughterhouse behind the poultry market and watching him at work . His father 's hands were sure and swift like lightning . He did the bird in with one clean stroke across the neck , plunged it into a vat of hot134 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 135water , said a prayer , and plucked it clean in a matter of seconds . It was a matter of great pride that Yehuda never left pinfeathers in his birds . The rabbis periodically examined Yehuda 's chickens to assure his proficiencyand never found an improperly killed bird . Nathan 's early fascination turned sour when he realized his father was grooming him to follow in his footsteps . He did n't want to spend the rest of his life slitting chickens ' throats , especially when he felt that Mordechai would end up as a rabbi . Moreover , his father 's bloody hands and bespattered apron always had a chicken smell . Even the weekly ritual bath at the mikva failed to completely deodorize him . Yehuda was paid a few kopeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket a few rubles , scarcely enough to sustain his family . He found a variety of odd jobs , mainly sharpening knives and scissors , to augment the family income . There were benefits . He could take out some of his pay in chickens , so there was usually enough to eat . Sophie knew how to utilize every part of the bird , except the parts that were not kosher . Extra chickens were traded for carp at the fish market or vegetables and milk from the gentile farmers . Even during the years of drought , when half the chickensdied of heat prostration , there was some food on the table . The main benefit of being the shohet was that it was an honorable , if undesirable , profession . Life in a shtetl town centered around the synagogue . Yehuda Zadok was a learned man in Talmud and his job accordedhim a certain communal respect . The synagogue had a rigid social structure . The building was always constructed so that the most sacred place , the Ark , was on the Eastern Wall which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rank , prominence , and respect , were the rabbi , cantor , and other town dignitaries . The last seats were reserved for the shohet and the shammes or sexton . The townspeople sat in the main body of the building facing the Eastern Wall . The closer to the Ark , the higher the communal rank . Wealth , of course , could acquire such a seat . Behind the first rows were the ordinary people and the poor . Farthest removed , along the Western Wall , were the beggars , town misfits , and visiting strangers . A small balcony , veiled off by latticework , was reserved for the women . Yehuda Zadok was gentler than most of the heads of households . Generally the father 's outlet against eternal frustration was to impose an authoritarian reign . Corporal punishment of children was common and wife beating was not uncommon . Yehuda seldom whipped his children , except when the futility of daily existence periodically crashed down on him . But his hands were always swift in delivering a single clout to the head or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis was brewing in the Zadok household , as Nathan and Mordechai were reaching an age where plans were to be made concerningtheir future education . Until now , his sons had attended cheder , a small one-room school connected to the synagogue . The subjects were Yiddish and Hebrew and , later , the Talmud . The cheder was little less than a glorified cell ; the teacher often a cruel ignorant authoritarian . His reward was to hold power over ragged , half-starved little boys . The hours were exhausting and the rabbi or teacher ruled with a leather strap . Textbooks were a few tattered volumesand modern methods and subjects were unknown . Nathan had been an adequate student , a survivor . Mordechai was singled out as exceptional and received tender treatment . By the age of nine he was a veritable fountain of Talmudic and religious knowledge . The next stage would normally be to go up to yeshiva , a larger school , which also taught state-approved secular courses in Russian and mathematics . Yeshiva posed a serious problem for Yehuda Zadok : there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as other expenses for books and materials . A rich man 's game . It was boiling down to making a choice between Nathan and Mordechai . As the oldest , Nathan was entitled to attend yeshiva first , but two sons in an advanced school was a luxury that a shohet could scarcely afford . Yehuda had been thinking all along of sending Nathan to a trade school so he could help with the family finances until he became a shohet . Nathan had a secret listening post into his parents ' discussions . His cot was against the wall next to their bedroom . If he stayed up late enough when they spoke , he could hold a glass against the wall and make out their conversation . " It would be unfair to deprive Nathan of yeshiva , " his mother argued . " And it would be criminal to deprive Mordechai , " Yehuda retorted . " So Nathan is not by any means a genius , he is still our oldest . " " What am I ? The Baron Rothschild ? Sophie , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 'd be losing a ruble a week that Nathan earns . We are elastic , but elastic also breaks . Since the Lord singled me out for personal abuse , it is reality that we can not put two boys through yeshiva at the same time . It takes no rabbinical court to tell which son is which . " 136 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 137And Matthias , and one day , Reuben ? " " So , by the time they are ready for yeshiva , Nathan will be a shohet with a full salary . " Sophie rushed in to argue the injustice of it but her case was as thin as the wall . " Besides , " Yehuda said as an afterthought , it is sometimes beyond difficult to be nice to that boy . Nathan is bitter . If only he did n't wear a face like rhubarb . " Nathan heard it all . He clenched the sheet in his little fists and wept on the pillow . I 'll show them ! I 'll run away from home ! I can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yehuda became more interested in his wife . Their lovemaking had fascinated Nathan at first , the way he was fascinated by watching his father kill chickens . Over a period of time their grunting and slobbering had grown grotesque . He had overheard Momma speaking among the women . She really did n't like doing it . Her insides were bad from having so many children and it caused her great pain . Yet she could not deny her husband . Nathan covered his ears . His father was sounding like an animal . LIKE MOST CHILDREN , Nathan was of the belief that his mother and father were either ignorant or naive about what was happening in the world around them . Yehuda Zadok had long mastered the art of contemplationwhile he prepared chickens for kosher . He was aware that certain past and present realities dictated future realities . Yehuda was a boy of six when the pogroms of the early 1880s flared up throughout the Jewish Pale of Settlement . His hometown , Kiev , had a particularly odious history of persecution . Forever seared into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish quarters and bashed in skulls , burned down synagogues , and looted and raped in an unrestrained frenzy of Jew hating  --  behavior encouraged and supported by the church and the czarist government . Yehuda tried to get to the synagogue to rescue his father , who had entered the burning building to save the sacred Torah scrolls . The boy was caught by a pair of drunken Cossacks , severely beaten , and left for dead . His body eventually healed but his brain had sealed in , and was condemned to perpetually replay , the sight of his father 's smoking corpse . WHEN ISLAM came to power in the Arab lands in the seventh century , the main Jewish population of Europe was centered in the Rhineland where they lived a precarious existence and were continually victimized by Papal-inspired scourges . During the Crusades of the ninth , tenth , and eleventh centuries , legionsof rabble were recruited in the Rhineland for the fight to regain the Holy Land . Maniacal monks , supported by a perverse church , whipped up an ignorant peasantry into blood orgies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus Christ on their sacred mission to save Jerusalem from those other heathens , the Moslems . In a desperation to escape , hundreds of thousands of Jews fled eastwardinto the feudal serfdoms of Poland and Russia . Most came at the invitation of the nobility , who needed Jewish skills to establish a middle class of merchants , craftsmen , bankers , physicians , and men of commerce , all areas where Jews excelled . Jewish history in Eastern Europe was to be enveloped in an eternal pall of gray . When the Russians of the north halted the advance of the Moslem armies from the south , reign over all of Russia fell to the Czars of Moscow in league with the Greek Orthodox Church . Jews were offeredthe dubious opportunity of converting to Christianity . During the Middle Ages , thousands of Jews were burned at the stake for rejecting the honor . Conversion attempts were so unsuccessful over the ages that Catherine I unleashed a series of pogroms in the early 1700s which climaxed with the expulsion of a million Jews from Russia to Poland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor , Catherine the Great , with the result that Poland was repartitioned a number of times and Russia reinherited the Jews who had been previously evicted . Thus started a never-ending series of laws banning Jews from trades and ownership of land , and excluding them from Moscow and St. Petersburgwhere they were considered to be in competition with Christianprofessionals . It all evolved into the establishment of a huge reservation in which the Jews had to live and beyond which the Jews were forbidden to go . The Pale of Settlement consisted of a million square miles from the Baltic to the Black Sea , one monstrous ghetto where they were trapped , divorced from the mainstream of Russian life , and reduced to basic survival . This was the birth of the shtetl , a string of towns and small cities open to Jews . Although the law of the Czar was all-powerful , the shtetl towns themselves gained a certain autonomy . The Jews ran their own social and health programs and religious courts , spoke the unique Yiddish138 LEON URIS MITLA PASS 139language , operated their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other alive through a magnificent system of charity . With Jews restricted to a few basic crafts and trades , boycotted from higher education , facing a constant barrage of suppressive laws , and subjected to the outrages of pogroms , shtetl life was a birth-to-death privation . A few Jews were able to slip through the net and were given dispensationto live in the great cities , but they were the rare cases . Such permissionwas granted to a handful of the wealthy or talented or cunning whose value to the Czar made them the exceptions . Despite the shabbiness of dress and humbleness of home , life in the shtetl had a magnificent and vital heartbeat . Much of the shtetl was in the grip of the tyrannical rabbis and cults , but otherwise there was harbored a smoldering genius of unmeasurable magnitude . Toward the end of the nineteenth century , a new rhythm overtook the shtetl and it was relentlessly probing to liberate itself . The pogroms of the 1880s became the flashpoint . Feeling neither love for " mother " Russia , nor loyalty to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive numbers after the latest series of state-approved blood baths . AFTER HIS FEARSOME beating during the Kiev pogrom , Yehuda Zadok seriously considered emigrating . His older brother , Samuel , had fled Russia for the questionable alternative of becoming a pushcart peddlerin Chicago . Samuel Zadok pushed his cart well  --  right out of the seething cauldronof Chicago into a small , mobile mercantile business that followed the silver strikes in Colorado . This resulted in a small general store in the frontier town of Denver . His oldest son had been accepted into a university to study medicine and two other sons were going to follow to college . America ! America ! What a wondrous place . Even Samuel 's daughter was earmarked for higher education . Can you imagine ? For a time Samuel urged Yehuda and his other close kin to emigrate , but Yehuda was a child mired in the shtetl without the necessary ambitionor courage to wrest himself loose from the grasp of his narrow , tortured life . After all , what could a shohet with a growing family do in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through life , but at least it was familiar . America was a wild and frightening place . Here in Wolkowysk , Yehuda knew he could always scrape through and he did have that seat on the Eastern Wall . His brother Samuel left an abundance of needy relatives in Russia and he was as generous to them as he was able . Often the international postal money order had kept Yehuda from going under . Yehuda accepted , but never asked . He had made his own bed . A new idea was making headway among the Jews and that was the resettlement and redemption of Palestine . Many of the younger people chose the Holy Land and left with a spirit of pioneers . The movement to Zion was small by comparison to the flood going to America , but it carried extraordinary zeal . The return to Zion was codified by a Viennese Jew , Theodor Herzl , at a convention in Basel , Switzerland , and soon had organizations in every shtetl . In 1905 , the year of Reuben 's birth , another series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somehow the venom was turned against the Jews , as it had always been . In the neighboring city of Bialystok the suffering was particularly horrible for the Jews at the hands of the army . Breezes of change became winds of change . Yehuda Zadok was wise enough to know that his sons would probably want to emigrate . He had silently prepared himself to let them go . All of them , except Mordechai . Mordechai was the flesh of his flesh , the soul of his soul . A young man immersed in Talmud , immersed in Yiddish , prepared for shtetl life . Althoughthe shtetl was splintering , some , like him , could never leave it . He was determined to salvage his own life and perpetuate it through Mordechai . When Nathan 's turn at rebellion came , Yehuda was ready . Irreversibleforces of history were at work and Yehuda had made a pragmatic decision of what to preserve and what to let go . IT WAS A pleasant spring day . Yehuda was feeling chipper . Max Pinker , owner of the textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max was one of a half-dozen wealthy members of the community and a major benefactor of his fellow Jews . He supported the yeshiva among his other notable charitable causes and almost no one begrudged him his seat on the Eastern Wall . There was a residue of bitterness when the union attempted to organizehis factory . He stopped the attempt ruthlessly . Everyone knew the labor people were wild radicals and agitators filled with anarchist philosophiescoming out of Russia . They were no damned good ! Moreover , Max was humane to his employees , more or less.
