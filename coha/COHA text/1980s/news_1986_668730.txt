For as far back as such records go , some 5 , 000 years , buttermilk , a byproduct of churning butter , has been used by man as a refreshing beverage and an ingredient in food preparation .

Nutritionist Barbara Deskins writes in her book , " Everyone ' s Guide to Food and Nutrition " : " The buttermilk available in the market today is produced from skim milk which has had a culture of lactic acid bacteria added to it . These bacteria grow and produce lactic acid which give buttermilk its distinctive sour flavor and slightly thickened texture . " The nutrient and caloric content of buttermilk are similar to those of the fluid milk from which it is made .
