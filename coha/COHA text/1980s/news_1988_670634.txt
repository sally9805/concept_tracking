In the play , Mr. Garber and Dana Ivey play a variety of Czechoslovak characters , each one coping differently in a country where material goods have become more readily available , just as political and artistic freedom are severely restricted . " When I was casting this play , " says Mr. Zaks , " I asked Larry ' s sister , Jackie , what she thought was behind his dividing the roles in this way - so many different roles between two actors . And , like Larry - sometimes when I posed an intricate question , he would give me a very simple response - she said , ' Well , Larry just loved actors. ' " // Mr. Shue joined the Milwaukee Repertory Company in 1977 as an actor , and it was there that he first wrote his plays and saw them produced . He originated the role of Froggy in " The Foreigner " in New York , and he was about to make his Broadway acting debut in " The Mystery of Edwin Drood " at the time of his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on such a roll , " says Mr. Zaks . " He was writing a screenplay of ' The Foreigner ' for the Disney Studio , he was working on a comedy series for CBS , he had been commissioned to write the book for his first Broadway musical ( ' The Honeymooners ' ) , and he was looking forward to doing ' Drood ' on Broadway . And aside from those things , you get the sense that , with ' Wenceslas Square ' he was beginning to really flex his muscles as a playwright. // " The play has those wonderful Shue touches - the musicality of his language , the comedy of missed connections , of people not understanding each other or being so frustrated at not being able to communicate , but it also deals with very serious things . The characters include a man whose passion - the book that he ' s writing - is put in jeopardy , and another man who has gone mad because of the pressures of living with totalitarianism. // " Some people might say that it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that , because the politics are dealt with only subtly . The story of the people is much more important than the politics . That ' s perfectly typical of Larry : he never allows the suspense or the story to be subordinated to any political point or message. " // Mr. Zaks had never heard of Larry Shue when the producer Jack McQuiggan sent him a copy of " The Foreigner " in 1984 . " I was completely knocked out by the effortlessness of the comic writing , " he recalls . " It was one of those special plays where you can ' t wait to see where it ' s going , and you can ' t believe that it ' s as funny as it is . It ' s so easy to get laughs , really - easy laughs . But the laughs Larry gets invariably come out of situation and characters , and always in a wonderfully surprising way that sucks you right into the story . Who knows what would have happened , how great his plays would be , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you either have or you don ' t . I can show you a dozen comedies right now where the playwrights are struggling to do what he did naturally. " // " The Foreigner " played to mostly sold-out houses during its previews , but once the play opened to tepid reviews , business plummeted . ( Word of mouth , however , continued to be enthusiastic , and attendance at the Astor Place Theater eventually sprang back . ) A majority of critics raved about Anthony Heald in the title role but were dismissive of the play itself . Critical reaction in London to " The Nerd , " which starred Rowan Atkinson and was the highest-grossing play in the West End in 1985 , was almost identical . When the trade publication Variety reviewed the first production of " The Nerd " in 1981 at the Milwaukee Repertory Company , it summarized the reception that would always meet Mr. Shue ' s work in his lifetime : " ' The Nerd ' is lowbrow humor , " wrote the Variety critic . " But the audience never stops laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move anyone ; it was never intended to , " says Mr. Zaks . " But when people walked out of that theater , they were dizzy . Every night , two or three hundred people went crazy in the basement of this building , and I remember thinking that if a visitor from another planet came and saw this , it would think something very powerful had been going on . " One of the few Off Broadway plays to overcome negative reviews , " The Foreigner " played 685 performances and fully recouped its $250 , 000 investment . It has since become one of the most performed plays in stock and amateur theaters , according to F. Andrew Leslie , president of the Dramatists Play Service , the play ' s publisher . " If Larry Shue were still alive he would be very comfortable because of it , " says Mr. Leslie. // " Obviously Larry ' s story is one of potential unfulfilled , " adds Mr. Zaks . " I don ' t want to paint him as a saint , but I always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to need or place great value on things that we get seduced into believing are important . I ' m sure he loved the success of ' The Nerd ' in the West End , and he loved the income he got from it . But he gave me the impression that if he had a cozy place to live , not a very big one , and some paper and a theater where he could get together with theater people to work , that would be O.K. That was the way he would have said it , ' Oh , sure , that sounds O.K. ' " //
