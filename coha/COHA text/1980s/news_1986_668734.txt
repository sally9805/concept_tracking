Keeping in mind that old show business advice to always leave them laughing , the National Theatre of Great Britain is winding up its visit to Chicago by letting down its hair , dropping its pants and putting on a pair of comedies that make broad fun of both the theater and Great Britain . The company ' s double bill of Tom Stoppard ' s " The Real Inspector Hound " ( 1968 ) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan ' s " The Critic " ( 1779 ) opened Wednesday night in the Blackstone Theatre with outrageous shtick on stage and great merriment in the audience . Clocking in at a little over three hours , the program ' s combination of wit and slapstick has a few dull spots and slow stretches ; but , lavishly produced with tons of scenery and even a small pit orchestra , it has plenty of lingering titters and hearty belly laughs , as well . It was a clever idea , in the first place , to combine the two playlets . Both , though widely separated in years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both offer some sly commentary on the prime theatrical subject of the difference between illusion and reality . Stoppard ' s modern play , directed by the author , is an ingenious linking of stage life and real life , in which two second-string critics find their own passions and desires actually crossing the footlights to interact with the characters involved in the goofy plottings of the " Mousetrap " - type English detective thriller they are reviewing . The irresistibly jolly Roy Kinnear , rotund and red-faced , is the cliche- spouting lowbrow lusting after the leading lady , while Edward Petherbridge , dry and effete , is the petty journalist next to him , hungering for the top critic ' s job on his paper . Behind them is a backdrop picturing the fake theater in which they are sitting ; in front of them , as they face the real audience in the Blackstone , is the play they are watching and in which they become surprisingly involved . In the second half of this evening of mini-repertory , the same actors whoop it up in britches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rehearsal of a ridiculous 18th Century epic , winding up their play-within-a-play with a patriotic extravaganza that is literally filled with fireworks . It ' s encouraging to note that English actors , those models of classic discipline , can ham it up with the best of them ; and it is sobering to see that they can stumble over their own feet , too . Some of their comic business is either off the mark or ill placed in " Hound , " and in " The Critic , " there are moments when the laughs are stretched far beyond their worth . Both weaknesses , it should be said , probably will be lessened as the actors get their comedy legs back in performance . Nevertheless , when the laughs come , they are frequently played to a fare thee well . I was particularly fond of Greg Hicks ' slithering leading man and Selina Cadell ' s limping maid as two of the dotty characters in " Hound ' s " mystery . In " The Critic , " I found Jonathan Hyde ' s chalk-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was taunting Petherbridge , master of the slow take , as a befuddled Sir Fretful Plagiary ) ; and in the scenes where the mock epic was being rehearsed , Peter Needham , as the lisping leading man with the greasy black wig , almost had me on the floor . Ian McKellen , throwing himself headlong into the juicy role of Mr. Puff , the banal playwright in " The Critic , " makes his performance a small textbook of comic acting . His thick accent makes him a little difficult to understand here , but that hardly matters when he can bring down the house with a mere wag of the head and a flounce of the body . About " The Critic ' s " spectacular ending I will give no hint , except to say that it gives us colonials a fine view of the English making fun of the English in a royal riot of nonsense .
