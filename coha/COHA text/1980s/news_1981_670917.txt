Speaking politely , almost deferentially , in Afrikaans , his own first language , Mr. Schoeman started to introduce himself and declare his mission . The mere mention of his party ' s name was enough to make Marius Froneman , a towering , thickset man who opened the apartment door , look as if he wanted to step outside and fight . " Don ' t argue , " said Emmerentia Froneman , stepping between her husband and the candidate , a slightly built man . " Just say that you ' re a Nationalist. " // The door then shut firmly , so it was impossible to ask what it was exactly that had infuriated Mr. Froneman . The probability was that it had less to do with being asked to vote for a party that favors sharing power with blacks than being asked in Afrikaans by an Afrikaner to do so . If he knew Mr. Schoeman ' s background , which has been prominently discussed in the Afrikaans as well as the Englishlanguage press , his sense of betrayal could only have been heightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate is not only an Afrikaner but also a former dominee , or minister , in the Dutch Reformed Church ; and not only a former dominee but also the nephew of one of the leading Afrikaner Cabinet ministers of the last generation , Ben Schoeman . Until recently , Afrikaners did not choose their political party ; they were born into them . Now , in a time of shifting and uncertain political values , they are starting to defect to the left as well as to the right in small but no longer insignificant numbers. // The defections will not prevent the National Party from winning 125 or more seats in the 165-seat Parliament in the all-white election Wednesday , but what they reveal about the popular mood could be decisive in influencing the balance of power within the governing party between those who see a need for modest changes on racial issues and those who think that they have already gone too far. // In the Randburg constituency , where Mr. Schoeman is standing against one of the youngest , brightest and , by reputation , most reform-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defections to the left could help produce a narrow upset . Like his challenger , Wynand Malan comes from a political family ; his father was once a provincial councilor in Randburg . Like him , too , the incumbent is 37 years old , a graduate of the University of Pretoria - as students the two men lived in the same dormitory - and a subscriber to the notion that " change " has to come to South Africa. // Mr. Malan is so open to new ideas that he is willing to declare in public , at the height of a political campaign , that the Group Areas Act , which decrees absolute residential segregation on the basis of race in South Africa , is inconsistent with the values of a freemarket economy . The clear implication is that he would be ready to amend the act , which amounts to an admission of heresy for a National Party candidate . <> <> Sole Face-to-Face Debate // There are those who say that the the governing party , which has ruled South Africa since 1948 , or outside it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fundamental disagreement on the nature of the change. // In the only face-to-face campaign debate in the entire country , Mr. Malan contended that the Progressive Federal Party ' s approach to sharing power would lead to black rule . The next day , in his storefront headquarters in a small shopping center , he noted with satisfaction that his rival had sidestepped that argument . " That was his weak point , " the Nationalist candidate said . " He never addressed his own policy . He didn ' t admit , he didn ' t deny. " // Asked whether it was not true , nonetheless , that he was closer to his Progressive opponent than he was to some of the more conservative members of his own caucus , Mr. Malan started to argue basic philosophy with some urgency . He said his opponent ' s views evolved from an outlook called humanism , which stresses individual rights . His own values and those of his party , he said , are based on Christianity , which stresses love and social order. // This distinction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells newspaper interviewers about the influence the Swiss theologian Karl Barth had on his own approach to religion and life . Mr. Schoeman shrugged off his opponent ' s interpretation of National Party politics with allusions to Calvin on the aims of politics and the role of the individual conscience , and then explained in more familiar political terms his reasons for thinking that it was important to defeat a supposedly flexible and pragmatic National Party candidate . <> <> ' Speed of the Slowest Horse ' // " There are many white voters who still have a lot of confidence in the so-called enlightened policies of the Government , " he said . " You ' ve got to leave questions behind , to remind them that this is a party that runs at the speed of the slowest horse . You ' ve got to make them ask whether the changes are really relevant . Reform is going to be change , but change doesn ' t necessarily mean reform. " // The district is about half English-speaking and half Afrikaans , with voters of English origin proving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most volatile element . But there is movement among Afrikaners . " There ' s an attitude I find only in the younger executive group between the ages of 30 and 40 , " Mr. Malan said , speaking of people whose life and circumstances are much like his own . " They don ' t exactly agree with the Progressives but they are not happy with the Nationalists . I got the impression that they think it is fashionable for young Afrikaners to be left-wing. " // Both candidates said the hardest part of their campaigns was putting across their parties ' intricate proposals for constitutional change . The Progressives favor the system of proportional representation under circumstances of universal suffrage ; explaining what that means is a stumbling block for Mr. Schoeman . Nationalists like Mr. Malan now talk about " group rights " rather than " white rights , " but not all their supporters know why. // " People voted for the Nationalists on words like apartheid , " Mr. Malan said . " To talk today about accommodating groups within a constellation of states conveys nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they ' ll buy it . They ' ll pay any price to buy it , because they ' re looking for answers. " //
