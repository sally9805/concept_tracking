The time is mid-1983 . Minutes after early-warning satellites pick up the launching of enemy missiles against the U.S. , the Pentagon ' s National Military Command Center flashes out the presidential order for a counter strike . The aging squadrons of B-52s from bases in North and South Dakota roar into the air . Later , while flying over North Pole ice sheets approximately 1,500 miles from their objectives , each bomber drops a deadly load of up to 20 cruise missiles . Like oversize model aircraft , these small unmanned jets skim at 500 m.p.h. only 50ft. above the ocean . Finally , hedgehopping their way under air defenses , the cruises ' nuclear warheads explode in mushroom clouds on their targets , Soviet air and naval bases near Murmansk and Archangel . <P> <P> It would be a Boeing-made missile that would carry out such an Armageddon mission . But the Seattle company 's victory in the Great Cruise Race came only after a long dogfight with rival defense contractor General Dynamics . The Air Force in November 1977 asked both companies to build prototype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deliberately pushed the two designs to-and occasionally beyond-their limits . <P> The two entries were surprisingly similar . <P> General Dynamics ' version was cigar-shaped and very slightly shorter than Boeing 's 20-ft. - 9- in. - long trapezoidal model , with its almost triangular cross section . Both missiles are also launched in the same manner . Immediately after being dropped from either wing pylons or out of the B-52 's underbelly , air-intake scoops for the rear-mounted engine pop open , wings slam out with enough force to cut a man in half , and the engine begins to whine . <P> At this point , the missile 's brain or guidance system wakes up . The cruise follows a preprogrammed course until it crosses a coastline . Then the missile can fly as low as 50 ft. in flatlands and over water , and up to about 500 ft. in more contoured country . When the brain says that there is a barrier or hills ahead , the missile flies over or around the obstacle . In wartime , this low altitude dash and the missile 's small size make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cruise is almost impossible to spot , and Mach2 fighters and surface-to-air missiles are not effective that close to the ground . The strategic theory : one cruise missile might be shot down but hundreds would overwhelm even the best and most sophisticated air defenses . <P> Starting last July , Boeing and General Dynamics each made ten test flights . Most were held over the bleak wastelands of the Utah Test and Training Range , near Dugway , Utah . The missiles were programmed to sprint at 500 m.p.h. round and round an aerial race course 100 miles long by 30 miles wide . In later tests some cruises were dropped from B-52s 60 miles out into the Pacific and programmed to fly back over California and Nevada to Utah . Air Force F-4 Phantom chase planes closely followed to observe and take over the missiles by radio control if anything went wrong . During one General Dynamics flight , TIME Correspondent Jerry Hannifin watched the missile belting along at 500 m.p.h. across the desert about 10 ft. above the ground . <P> The flights were not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
