Every boom spawns its prophets of doom , and the current bull market is no exception . Right now the most visible naysayer is a previously little-known economics professor named Ravi Batra . His eye-catching book , The Great Depression of 1990 , has jumped to No. 4 in its sixth week on the New York Times ' nonfiction best-seller list . At $17.95 a copy , it has been snapped up by some 175,000 buyers who are either curious or concerned  --  or both  --  about just how high the current boom can go before it turns to bust . <P> The Indian-born Batra , 44 , who teaches at Southern Methodist University , begins his book by raising the specter of the Great Depression of the 1930s : " I believe a disaster of the same , if not greater , severity is already in the making . It will occur in 1990 and plague the world through at least 1996 . " He details parallels between the Roaring Twenties and the Soaring Eighties : feverish speculation , financial deregulation and a shaky banking system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extreme concentration of wealth . As was the case in 1929 , he says , 1% of American households control about 35% of the nation 's assets , compared with as little as 21% in 1949 . Because the lower and middle classes now have a smaller proportion of the assets , they rely heavily on borrowing and thus become overextended . That puts at heavy risk the banks and other institutions that have loaned them money . Meanwhile , as the rich grow richer , Batra says , they become enamored of speculative investments . As a result , goes Batra 's theory , the financial house of cards will topple . The stock market will crash , the banking system will collapse , and the American economy will be forced to its knees . <P> Batra 's thesis turns on his highly questionable contention that an inexorable cycle brings a depression every 60 years or so . To be sure , Batra is not alone in his gloomy outlook . Many other thinkers , including Economist John Kenneth Galbraith , have drawn comparisons between the perils of 1929 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Batra 's position that an uncontrollable calamity is inevitable .
