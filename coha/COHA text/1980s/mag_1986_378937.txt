Mafia Showdown <P> To the Editors : Americans must destroy the power of crime families NATION , Sept. 29 . U.S. Attorneys Rudolph Giuliani and Diane Giacalone deserve to be praised for their outstanding work in prosecuting Mafia Boss John Gotti . He and the other bosses are the scum of the earth . Phillip Bryant Snow Fort Lauderdale <P> Your report was one of the most enlightening articles on law enforcement I have read . Giuliani and his department should be awarded the Medal of Honor for courage in the line of duty ; in fact , above and beyond the call of duty . John P. Donoski Bridgeport , Conn . <P> Beneath the hype and ambition of the prosecutors in the trials of the Mafia families lies the real issue of human frailty . The decimation of these organizations will not thwart the demand for their services . In time , others , perhaps more ruthless and less insular , will fill the vacuum .

Unfortunately , the paranoia of Parisians and the street patrols have not ended . Soldiers continue to stand on busy corners , and avenues are choked with cars and taxis carrying people afraid to ride the Mtro . I wish I could have felt comfortable reading your story as an after-the-fact commentary . But the security checks and sirens remind us that it is not over yet . Carolyn Grose Paris <P> I truly feel sorry for the Parisians who are enduring this wave of bombings . But to some New Zealanders , this latest bout of terrorism is ironic . Was it not the French government that committed its own terrorist bombing against the Greenpeace ship in New Zealand last year ? France strongly lobbied for the release of two of its terrorists , Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur , just as the Arab extremists are now campaigning for the release of their comrades .

Her visit to the U.S. was yet another magical event WORLD , Sept. 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians and a reproach to past leaders of different virtues . Jesus C. Bacala Scottsburg , Ind . <P> President Aquino 's charm lies in her honesty . Until she came along , I was disillusioned with politicians . She has projected a new image of the profession . We Koreans thirst for a leader like Aquino . Chin-Hyun Kim Soon-Chon City , South Korea <P> Corazon Aquino may be our finest world leader today . John Hannahs Evanston , Wyo . <P> After the cheers and applause for President Aquino have died down , I hope Americans will not forget their pledge to support her government .
