 | For Jackie Stewart , three-time world race-car champion , it was the ideal situation . He wanted to retire from the track but still work with cars . The solution ? Become a car-design consultant and salesman for Ford Motor Company . As a corporate adviser , the superachiever gets a chance to shift gears into semiretirement . " I knew it would be a good way to make money without the capital investment and risk necessary when you go into business yourself , " reasons Stewart , 47 , who also consults for Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Company . Stewart is just one of many celebrities who are cashing in on their expertise , not just their names . The use of famous faces in ads and commercials to peddle wares is as popular as ever . But many personalities are busy behind the scenes , too . In addition to making endorsements , they help companies improve products or develop ideas . At Ford , Stewart works wheel to wheel with staff engineers to improve the handling of new cars . " American cars used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , at least , Fords have become lean and clean in their response . " Top woman race driver Lyn St. James , 38 , gives Ford the perspective of the 40 percent of today 's car buyers who are women . " I have a fetish about steering wheels , " she says . " The Turbocoupe now has a smaller , thicker steering wheel and a seat that rises up to accommodate women 's different body shapes . " In the aerospace field , retired Brig . Gen. Chuck Yeager , 62 , is still a test pilot , but he no longer flies " Glamorous Glennis , " the experimental plane he used to break the sound barrier in 1947 . Now , he soars in Northrop 's F-20 fighter prototypes , which are under consideration for federal contracts . " Chuck brings a unique experience and insight , " says C. Robert Gates , the F-20 program manager . " With Chuck 's assistance , we 've determined the best cockpit layout . The pilot can set the whole military weapons system on for air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't think about flying the plane but rather accomplishing his mission . " Cooking up a winner Some public figures do n't just advise , they create new products on their own . Country singer Jimmy Dean is as famous today for his pork sausage and other breakfast foods as he is for his ballads . Sixteen years ago , he decided he could make a better sausage than the one he was eating at a diner in Plano , Tex . Drawing on his family 's experience in the hog business , he created a line of products even more successful than his singing career . When Sara Lee Corporation bought him out for $15 million in 1984 , he became chairman with a 10-year contract and no daily responsibilities . " They were willing to invest $10 million to expand my Iowa plant , " he says . " It was an offer I could n't refuse . " Sara Lee Chairman John Bryan , Jr. , admits he did n't buy the Jimmy Dean Meat Company just on good taste alone . " I was attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a powerful brand , " says Bryan . " His following loves him dearly . " Former New York Yankees ' pitching star Jim Bouton was on the comeback trail in 1979 when his teammates in the bullpen of the Portland , Oreg. , Mavericks convinced him there was a market for a tobaccoless product that resembled chewing tobacco . " They wanted something macho that they could chew but would n't make them sick , " recalls Bouton . " I could n't get the idea out of my head . " Two years and several thousand dollars later , Bouton had designed a prototype and sold the rights to make a shredded chewing gum in a pouch called Big League Chew . Sales are now in the millions , says A. G. Atwater , president of Wrigley 's Amurol Products , the gum maker that bought Bouton 's idea . The  | former pitcher now has his own new product-development company and is marketing " fantasy fulfillment " baseball cards that allow a customer to request that his or her own picture , name and statistics be displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after his playing career ended , tennis legend Arthur Ashe still tests rackets for AMF Head , Inc . " The engineers give us placebo rackets as well as the prototypes to make sure the responses are n't doctored , " says Ashe . " We test them for torque resistance , stiffness and responsiveness to off-center hits . " Ashe 's fame as the first black male to win Wimbledon has also brought him work in fields far beyond the tennis court . In 1977 , Aetna Life &; Casualty asked him to assist in minority hiring and retention , and in 1982 the insurer invited him to join its board . Since Ashe began working for Aetna , the firm has had significantly lower attrition rates among black trainees than it had before . Going beyond the limelight Being a hot star never hurts business . After Czech tennis player Ivan Lendl won last fall 's U.S. Open , sales of the tennis shoes he designed for Adidas rose 20 percent . Basketball superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls is another case in point . His highflying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers he developed mandatory equipment on many of the nation 's playgrounds . " I could never wear Nikes before because they were so elevated that I could n't feel the floor , " says the owner of a size 12 ? foot . " So they took a lot of air pockets out for me , made it lighter and with softer leather . I can play in them right out of the box . " Nike 's agreement with Jordan calls for him to be a shoe consultant for five years . His contract includes a $1 million guarantee in royalties the first year . Nike profits , too : In the year after the shoe was introduced , the company sold $130 million worth of Air Jordan shoes . For Jordan , shoes are only the beginning . Nike is also creating a line of Michael Jordan sportswear , and Jordan will endorse grooming products for Johnson Products . Wilson Sporting Goods makes three types of Jordan basketballs , and Guy Laroche sells a $125 Time Jordan wristwatch . The basketball star also does commercials for Chevrolet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product 's success , however . Take the case of model Christie Brinkley , who tried to develop a line of swimsuits and other sportswear with clothing manufacturer Russ Togs , Inc. , in 1983 . The venture folded within 18 months after losses that exceeded $1 million . The market , it seems , was just too saturated with designer labels , says securities analyst Edward Johnson of Prescott , Ball &; Turben . Despite Brinkley 's reputation , neither the styling nor the pricing of her line was enough to overcome the market glut . For celebrities involved in product development , what happened to Brinkley is the ultimate nightmare . To such personalities , nothing is more precious than their names and images , and to have those assets identified with a losing product can undermine the commercial good will that they 've spent years developing . As market-research expert Chet Kane says , " You would n't put your name on a bad check , would you ? " A clothing designer Christie Brinkley was n't           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
