A briefing in a New Zealand bar boomerangs in Washington <P> " Ambassador Kirkpatrick did a superb job , which has been characteristic of her performance at the United Nations from the outset . " So said Secretary of State Alexander Haig last week about Jeane Kirkpatrick , U.S. Ambassador to the U.N . That gracious praise was not exactly spontaneous : Haig was scrambling to patch up the damage done by leaks from his own aides , who had criticized Kirkpatrick 's handling of a U.N . resolution condemning Israel for its bombing of Iraq 's nuclear reactor . The sniping infuriated not only Kirkpatrick but the White House as well . It deeply embarrassed Haig and provided more ammunition for both domestic and foreign critics who feel that the Administration 's foreign policy is aimless in substance and disorganized in execution . <P> The flap began at a hotel bar in Wellington , New Zealand . State Department Spokesman Dean Fischer and Politico-Military Affairs Director Richard Burt , who were accompanying Haig on his two-week swing through the Pacific , asked Bernard Gwertzman of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal to join them for drinks . With Fischer glancing at notes , the two aides blamed Kirkpatrick for fouling up negotiations on the U.N . resolution . They claimed she ignored instructions from the National Security Council and initially supported a resolution that called for economic sanctions against Israel , urged nations to review their arms policies toward the Jewish state , and declared that Iraq had a right to collect compensation from the Israelis . When Haig received a copy of the draft in Peking , according to the aides , he scribbled a note to Kirkpatrick telling her that the U.S. could not vote for such a resolution . The aides contended that she succeeded only in persuading the Iraqis to abandon the call for sanctions . <P> But after Haig telephoned Iraqi Foreign Minister Saadoun Hammadi from Manila , claimed his aides , the Iraqis also consented to drop the arms policies provision and soften the call for damages , thereby allowing the U.S. to vote for the resolution . <P> Both the Times and the Journal carried accounts of the criticisms implying that the aides had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Saint-Rmy , France , Kirkpatrick declared she was " surprised and hurt " about the attack on her performance . She insisted that in her negotiations with the Iraqis she had followed a National Security Council directive approved by Haig and Reagan . She contended that she never supported a resolution calling for sanctions or a review of arms policies toward Israel ; she acknowledged that Haig had called Hammadi , but only after the negotiations had ended . Furthermore , Kirkpatrick claimed she talked at least twice a day with either Haig or Acting Secretary of State Walter Stoessel as well as with National Security Adviser Richard Allen . " I was determined not to be involved in an agreement which , once it was concluded , the President was going to say , ' Oh gee , she should n't have done that , ' " Kirkpatrick told TIME . " If there had been any more communication , we would have had to have an open telephone line . "                  @ @ @
