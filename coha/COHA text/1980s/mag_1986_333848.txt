A squad of sheriff 's deputies storm a duplex suspected of being a base for drug dealers , batter in the front door and burst inside . The place is empty , except for a bewildered woman in cutoff shorts . " Put it on the wall , lady , " shouts an officer , pushing her against the paneling and placing her under arrest . But she is released two days later when the police can not provide evidence linking her with a quarter-gram of cocaine found in the apartment . <P> That fizzled bust was not unusual except for one feature : it was seen on national TV . The raid , in the Houston suburb of Channelview , was one of three drug busts telecast live to 141 stations on a two-hour syndicated special , American Vice : The Doping of a Nation . The program , with Geraldo Rivera as host and producer , has drawn fire from journalists and police officials alike for its sensational reporting tactics . <P> The flap marks the second embarrassment this year for Rivera , the gonzo journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivera was host of another special , The Mystery of Al Capone 's Vaults , in which the gangster 's secret cache was opened on live TV , only to reveal a few dusty bottles .

All were real police operations , conducted under legal search warrants and coordinated so that they could be shown during the telecast ( 8 p.m . EST ) . But one man arrested in a raid on a house in San Jose was released two hours afterward , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renter of the apartment was arrested later , off camera . ) The Texas raid got a big buildup from Rivera ( the authorities , he said , were after " a pimp and his prostitutes . . . this dude and his ladies " who were allegedly dealing dope to truckers ) . But the woman arrested , Terry Rouse , claimed she had been living at the duplex for only a week , and charges were dismissed by Texas District Judge Donald Shipley . She is planning to file suit against the police and possibly Rivera and his production company as well . <P> Rivera points out that the raids were legitimate police operations that would have taken place even without the cameras . " We were covering the law enforcement ( officers ) doing their job , " he says . " It was their event , not ours . " Complaints against the show , Rivera contends , come from journalists who dislike his aggressive and emotional reporting style . " I 'm not afraid to get down and dirty , " he says .
