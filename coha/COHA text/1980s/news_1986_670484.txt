At the same time , however , faced with new economic realities , most notably a slackening in advertising sales , the networks have been drastically cutting both staff levels and production budgets . There is little joy on Broadcast Row this holiday season . And the corner-cuttings are slowly but surely being reflected in on-screen product. // Cable development also seemed stalled on key levels . Too many cablecasters have apparently decided that the future lies nostalgically in old network series or in new sitcoms badly imitating old network sitcoms . In addition , viewers are discovering that cable has its own economic realities . New York ' s political scandals this year have been riddled with allegations about the awarding of cable franchises , raising the always pertinent question as to why , after some 15 years , Manhattan is the only one of the city ' s five boroughs to be hooked up for cable . And even in Manhattan , it borders on the incredible that subscribers still can not get such pay services as Bravo or the Disney Channel . Viewer choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how much you are willing to spend. // In any event , looking over my lists of the year ' s more outstanding programs in entertainment and the arts , I find that the one for the commercial networks is only half as long as the combined total for public television and cable ' s Arts &; Entertainment network ( which , of course , can not be seen in most of New York City ) . And , perhaps not surprisingly , the longer list is top-heavy with imports from foreign broadcasting entities that periodically are willing to put more of an emphasis on arts than on entertainment . And by " arts , " let me be clear , I do not mean a steady , elevated diet of Shakespeare and Beethoven . Probably the most effective TV drama of the year , certainly the one that generated the most favorable comments from readers , was a small , exquisite British import on PBS called " Shadowland . " Based on biographical material from the life of C. S. Lewis , the British writer famed for his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author ' s late-life relationship with a dying woman who would bring him into the mysteries of marriage and love . Moving performances by Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland transformed a relatively modest production into a television gem. // As for continuing series , the networks were unable to come up this year with another " Cosby Show " or " Hill Street Blues . " Among the new situation comedies , only three of the current survivors are not instantly forgettable , primarily because of some first-rate casting . On ABC , back-to-back on Wednesdays , " Perfect Strangers " features the tightly meshed antics of Bronson Pinchot and Mark Linn-Baker , while " Head of the Class " has the world-weary Howard Hesseman , once the spaced disk-jockey on " WKRP in Cincinnati , " teaching a thing or two to exceptionally bright and smirking students . And just recently , CBS weighed in with " The Cavanaughs , " which not only provides a sturdy showcase for Barnard Hughes and Christine Ebersole as wisecracking father and daugher but also , in a departure for TV comedy , re-creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish-American. // Each of the three networks managed to offer at least one TV movie of the sort that is usually nominated for awards . NBC had " Unnatural Causes , " starring Alfre Woodard and John Ritter in a provocative drama supporting the cause of Vietnam veterans who charge that they were severely damaged through contact in the field with the defoliant known as Agent Orange . ABC ' s " Nobody ' s Child " starred Marlo Thomas in the based-on-fact story of a misdiagnosed woman who had spent years of her life in mental institutions . And CBS offered several strong candidates worthy of special attention : " Penalty Phase , " with Peter Strauss as a California judge confronting political law-and-order pressures ; " Promise , " with James Garner as a freewheeling bachelor coping with James Woods as his schizophrenic brother ; " Blood and Orchids , " with Jane Alexander as a wealthy villainess covering up a racial incident that took place in Hawaii shortly before the bombing of Pearl Harbor ; " Resting Place , " with John Lithgow as an Army officer trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s whites-only cemetery ; and " Second Serve , " with Vanessa Redgrave giving a riveting performance as the transsexual tennis star Renee Richards. // Over on public television , budget restraints were becoming even more ominous as Exxon announced that it would be phasing out support for the " Great Performances " series . Only " American Playhouse " remains as a major forum for ambitious domestic ventures in drama . Among its stronger entries this year were the miniseries " Roanoke " and a fine studio rendering of Tina Howe ' s play " Painting Churches . " Another series , " American Masters , " was at its best with Perry Miller Adato ' s documentary " Eugene O ' Neill : A Glory of Ghosts . " The rest of the public-TV schedule relied almost wholly on imports or acquisitions from independent producers. // On WNET , a couple of tributes to British-TV services brought a raft of goodies . Channel Four , one of the recipients , sent over films such as " Accounts , " a murder mystery wrapped in political and class attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Oresteia " by Aeschylus , directed by Peter Hall . A subsequent salute to BBC-TV , on the occasion of its 50th anniversary , included " Tango Mio , " a superb portrait of life and dancing - they seem inseparable - in Argentina. // The dominance of the British presence was eased somewhat by WNET ' s " Channel Crossings , " a series of imports that goes farther afield for its acquisitions . Among its highlights : the Dutch " You Are My Mother , " in which the actor Joop Admiraal portrays both himself and his mother confined to an old-age home , and the Indian " 36 Chowringhee Lane , " the tender story of an Anglo-Indian teacher of Shakespeare as she faces retirement and loneliness. // Rattling around elsewhere on the public-TV schedule were a couple of productions assuring fans that a certain , almost eccentric style of British acting remains alive and delightfully well . The series " Mystery ! , " in addition to the occasional treat of having Joan Hickson impersonate Agatha Christie ' s Miss Marple , brought in Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named " Chalders and Caldicott . " And then the mini-series " Mapp &; Lucia , " based on the novels of E. F. Benson , featured Geraldine McEwan as wickedly scheming Lucia , Nigel Hawthorne as her insanely fluttering friend Georgie , and Prunella Scales as the plumply hypocritical Mapp . A memorable exercise in calculated froth . And public television ' s best children ' s series of the year came from Canada in the form of " Anne of Green Gables , " starring a charming young actress named Megan Fellows. // Cable ' s A &; E service could be mistaken for a public-TV outlet except for the commercial breaks - not an inconsiderable difference by any means . Having a special business relationship with the BBC , the network gets , in addition to an uneven assortment of BBC sitcoms and documentaries , a remarkable number of accomplished dramas . This year ' s lineup included superb productions of Oscar Wilde ' s " Lady Windermere ' s Fan , " Frederick Raphael ' s " Oxbridge Blues , " Anita Brookner ' s " Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Hunter ' s 1950 ' s play " Waters of the Moon. " // Pay cable , or at least those services that can be seen in Manhattan , had a generally quiet year , consolidating some of its gains , primarily in comedy projects , and trying to avoid some of the dopier movie concepts it bought in recent years . Showtime had some of its best moments with two plays : " As Is " and " Picnic . " Home Box Office offered " Murrow , " an overly somber but accurate biography of the famed newscaster . Perhaps cable ' s low profile complements the rest of the television picture for 1986 , a year in which respectable achievements must be measured against some notable disappointments . While CBS had its " Fresno " - television ' s first comedy miniseries and a near total bust - PBS had its " Paradise Postponed , " proving that even a writer of John Mortimer ' s stature can overextend himself . That , apparently , is show business , not to mention television. //    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
