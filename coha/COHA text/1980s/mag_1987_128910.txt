Something about the penalty box at Edmonton 's Northlands Coliseum seemed different late last Friday night . Ah , yes  --  it was empty . After spending an interminable evening in its confines , members of the Oilers and the Calgary Flames were now free to bandage their faces and ice their fists . And the Flames ' 6-3 victory could assume its rightful place among the more repugnant contests in NHL history . Not that anyone had expected a cotillion . Only 180 miles apart , Edmonton and Calgary have had it in for one another since 1883 when officials decided to send the Canadian Pacific Railway 's Alberta line through Calgary instead of Edmonton , as previously planned . // Before last week 's resumption of the teams ' Uncivil War  --  a Thursday-Friday home-and-home series that served as a possible dress rehearsal for the Smythe Division finals  --  the NHL 's Alberta franchises were the league 's proudest . Also hottest . Between them , the first-place Oilers and second-place Flames had won 22 of their last 25 games . " These are the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calgary coach Bob Johnson . " We 're spoiling these fans , huh ? " // But instead of a showcase of sizzling hockey , Albertans got Wrestlemania on Ice  --  and two Calgary victories . Although Thursday 's game featured long stretches of splendid play , Friday 's was little more than a three-hour slugfest ( see summary ) . There were 60 penalties in all , a numbing 250 minutes ' worth , and six ejections . The thuggery went from distasteful to discouraging to downright boring . Most disturbing was the fact that after falling behind on Friday night , the Oilers essentially conceded the game and seemed intent on avenging Calgary 's unpunished cheap shots of the previous evening . Thus it was a far cry from last year 's superbly  --  and cleanly  --  played division finals when the Flames ended Edmonton 's pursuit of a third straight Stanley Cup . // On Thursday night in the Saddledome the Flames won 5-4 , with a little help from an old friend from the ' 86 playoffs , Oiler defenseman Steve Smith . Calgary gunners Joey Mullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter , Jamie Macoun and Neil Sheehy explored the absolute limits of legal stickwork . The win was Calgary 's fifth in six tries against Edmonton this season . How could this happen ? Do n't the Oilers have six of the world 's best players ? Do the Flames have six of Alberta 's ? " Too much talent can spoil the soup , " postulates Calgary wing Nick Fotiu , a Staten Island , N.Y. , heavyweight who picked up organized hockey at the age of 15. // Edmonton G.M.-coach Glen Sather thought " the referee did n't call a lot of the interference , hooking and holding , " but Johnson said , " What you saw was a man 's game . " Badger Bob , who coached Wisconsin to three NCAA titles and keeps his roster stacked with former U.S. collegians , lost 4-1 to Montreal in the Stanley Cup finals last year . " I 'm on the back side , " he says , employing a golf metaphor to chart his career . " About the 16th hole . I just got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // If it 's going to happen , now is the time . Team leaders John Tonelli , Doug Risebrough and the outlandishly mustachioed Lanny McDonald have three dozen NHL seasons among them and are creaking more than ever . But Mullen , who learned his hockey on roller skates in the Hell 's Kitchen section of New York City , will be around a while , as will Bullard , who was acquired from the Penguins last November . So will defenseman Gary Suter , the 1986 Rookie of the Year , who played at Wisconsin ; center Joel Otto , who played at Bemidji ( Minn . ) State ; and center Joe Nieuwendyk , who joined the Flames from Cornell just two weeks ago . // Sather has done some minor rebuilding in Edmonton with an eye toward reclaiming a certain piece of hardware . Ex-Ranger Reijo Ruotsalainen , who is in a league with the Oilers ' Paul Coffey and Boston 's Ray Bourque as an offensive defenseman , and ex-Flame/ex-North Star Kent Nilsson , an all-offense , no-defense forward , joined Edmonton early in March and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obvious : Stop Coffey and Ruotsalainen will beat you ; stop Wayne Gretzky and Nilsson will beat you . Another recent addition , but one without any of the pure skills of Ruotsalainen or Nilsson , was 6 ' 5 " , 230-pound Wayne Van Dorp , who was called up on March 17. // " Where 'd they get that guy ? " wondered the Badger after laying eyes on Van Dorp . " Joe 's Gym ? " // Actually , it was Nova Scotia of the AHL . Edmonton summoned him to replace another enforcer , Marty McSorley , who was serving an eight-game suspension for bashing an opponent 's head . // " Sather used to stress how they played European-style hockey , how skilled they were , how we should n't push them around , " says Flames assistant coach Pierre Page . " But they 've always had some pretty big boys who can take care of business . " By way of introducing himself , Van Dorp bloodied Fotiu 's nose and mouth . Fotiu answered with a flurry of rights and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 12:36 of the third period was almost a case of d ? j ? vu . With Tonelli pushing hard up the left side , McDonald , covered by Steve Smith , cut across the crease . Tonelli 's pass glanced off Smith 's skate and into the net . // It was Smith , you recall , whose would-be clearing pass late in Game 7 last May hit Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr in the leg , deflected into the net , and gave Calgary the series . His latest faux pas brought boundless joy to Saddledome partisans who had screamed " Shoot ! Shoot ! " every time Smith touched the puck . // On Friday afternoon in Edmonton Coffey was discussing the physical flavor of Thursday night 's game . " Wait till tonight " he said . A homemade sign in the Coliseum , just to the left of one that said SHEEHY THE BUTCHER , read : CALGARY , PENALTY CAPITAL OF THE WORLD . Not for long . The Flames and the Oilers faced off at 7:37 . Twenty-eight seconds later , five fights were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meted out ; six players were ejected . Play resumed at 7:50. // It went downhill from there . The Oilers wanted Sheehy so badly they could taste him . But he allowed them no satisfaction . " I was taking sticks in the gut , chops on the legs . A few guys punched me in the face , " said the Butcher , who played at Harvard and is Bronco Nagurski 's nephew , " but I was n't going to play into their hands . " Indeed , Sheehy earned his team 11 minutes on the power play . // Not that Calgary capitalized . In fact , the Flames ' first two scores were byproducts of the game 's sloppy tone . With Calgary down two men , Fuhr tried to flip the puck away from ace penalty-killer Steve Bozek . However , the puck deflected off Bozek , who opportunistically shot it in the goal . Six minutes later Jim Peplinski beat Fuhr for Calgary 's second short-handed goal . After that , the 6-3 rout was on . // " These games are worth two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not as if we 've lost the Stanley Cup . " // It did seem , however , that the Flames were seizing on the same flaws Edmonton displayed last spring : an unwillingness to follow the puck into the zone ; a tendency to get caught with just one defenseman back ; and " A case of the cutes ... Shirley Temple disease , " as Edmonton Journal columnist Cam Cole calls the Oilers ' overpassing. // Sather seemed resigned as he sat on the Ping-Pong table in the Oilers ' dressing room and digested Friday 's defeat . " I might as well not have been there , " he said . " I talked to them between periods , I talked to them on the bench . It did n't make any difference . The next group on the ice was n't concerned about hockey . I 'm more embarrassed by that game than any I 've ever been involved in. " // Johnson agreed . " An absolute nothing game , " he said . " I did n't enjoy coaching it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " // Absolutely right .
