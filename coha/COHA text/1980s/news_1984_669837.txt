LOS ANGELES  --  A federal district court here cleared the way for the merger of a Warner Communications Inc. unit and Polygram Records Inc . The proposed merger would form the nation ' s biggest record concern . Under terms of the merger agreement announced late last year , Warner ' s Warner Bros . Records Inc. unit , the second largest U.S. record company , and Polygram , the sixth largest , would form a joint venture with total sales of about $1 billion , surpassing CBS Inc. ' s record unit as the industry leader . Warner would control 80% of the combined concern and Polygram 20% . Judge Manuel Real ruled yesterday that the Federal Trade Commission , which had sued March 6 to block the merger , failed to prove that the combination would violate antitrust laws . Judge Real denied the FTC ' s request for an injunction to prevent the merger . Warner ' s general counsel , Martin Payson , said that the company plans to go ahead with steps to complete the transaction . However , Jack Carley , FTC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay of the merger pending an appeal of the Los Angeles court decision . He said the FTC plans to pursue its case to block the merger and has started an administrative proceeding on the merits of the Warner-Polygram combination . Polygram is jointly owned by NV Philips of the Netherlands and Siemens AG of West Germany . However , after the U.S. merger is completed , Philips will control most of Polygram ' s 20% stake , with Siemens taking a smaller position in the U.S. operation . Warner and Polygram already had won approval for the merger of their European operations by British and French antitrust authorities . The European joint venture company is to be 50% owned by Warner and 50% owned by Polygram . The record industry had strongly opposed the venture and submitted numerous affidavits against it . CBS Records Group has said that if the merger was approved , it , too will seek to acquire a record company . CBS currently holds 23% of the U.S. market . Warner has about 18% and would have about 26% after its merger with Polygram . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the court decision . The FTC voted 4-1 March 6 to block the merger on grounds that it would greatly increase concentration in the record industry , where six companies control 85% of the market . The Warner-Polygram merger would cut that down to five companies with the same market share , and two companies  --  Warner-Polygram and CBS  --  would control nearly 50% . The FTC also claimed that the merger would lead to price collusion and make new entry infeasible . Until that vote , however , Warner attorneys had said the FTC staff had assured them that the merger would be approved . Two reports by the FTC ' s bureau of economics had concluded that the merger wasn ' t anti-competitive because competition in the record industry has been heightened by , among other things , the practice of home taping of records , which has cut into record sales . In addition , Polygram has said that because of heavy losses in the U.S. it will have to cease operations here if it does not merge with a larger company . Warner last week asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose those reports . Judge Real ordered the reports to be presented but held them under court protection . Mr. Carley of the FTC acknowledged that the reports favored the merger , but he said " you have to assume the commission had other information " that led it to rule against the merger . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Warner closed at $22. 50 , down 75 cents . CBS closed on the Big Board yesterday at $69. 125 , up 12. 5 cents .
