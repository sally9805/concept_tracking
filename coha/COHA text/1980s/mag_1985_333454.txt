An extraordinary specter is haunting the leaders of some of America 's largest corporations . The specter is a Texan  --  a very rich and wily one . His name is T. ( for Thomas ) Boone Pickens Jr . The danger executives see is that he may be out to buy their company , and when Pickens attacks , his prey rarely escapes unscathed . Indeed , a remarkable run of successes has made T. Boone Pickens , 56 , president of Amarillo-based Mesa Petroleum , probably the most feared corporate raider on the business scene today . <P> Last month , in order to end a takeover fight , Phillips Petroleum agreed to buy the 8.9 million shares that Pickens and his partners held in the company . That stands to earn the group an $89 million profit , and started speculation about Pickens ' next target . " I think he is going to do the same thing again , and sooner rather than later , " says Alan Edgar , an energy analyst for Schneider , Bernet &; Hickman , a Dallas securities firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at anything that makes sense , " he says . " And that 's the end of that conversation . " <P> But while Pickens is saying little about his plans , Wall Street is buzzing with speculation . Among the most frequently named takeover targets are Mobil , the third largest U.S. energy company , Texaco , the fourth biggest , Sun , which ranks ninth , and Unocal , the twelfth . <P> The mere talk of a takeover bid from Pickens can drive up a stock 's price . Last month shares of Mobil jumped 1 5/8 points in a day on rumors that Pickens was interested in the company . The stock of Sun and Unocal also rose on takeover talk . Moreover , when Pickens went after such firms as Cities Service and Gulf , shareholders saw the value of their holdings increase sharply . Gulf stock jumped from $40 to $80 a share in a seven-month period . <P> Pickens and his partners also did very well in such deals . Gulf and Cities Service , alarmed at the prospect of a takeover by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus increased the value of Pickens ' stock . Result : he earned huge profits but never took over those companies . Last year Pickens and friends made $760 million through their run at Gulf , which was eventually taken over by Chevron . <P> Major acquisitions , though , can have some negative consequences . The debt that companies incur to finance takeovers can reduce their earnings and lower their stock prices . Chevron shares fell to a twelve-month low of 30 last week , partly because of its heavy borrowings . <P> Pickens ' spectacular gains have led critics to charge that he is really an adept practitioner of " greenmail . " A greenmailer creates the threat of a takeover by buying a big chunk of a company 's stock . He then sells the shares back to the firm at a premium when its executives , fearing the loss of their jobs in a takeover , agree to buy him out . Pickens denies any intention of greenmail : " If we had wanted to greenmail Phillips , it would have been a substantially different deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work hard for the stockholders , and I still feel very good about that . " <P> Big oil firms hold several attractions for Pickens . Many are rich in assets that include plentiful oil reserves . At the same time , their stock prices are often so low that the firms may be worth more if they are dismantled and their divisions sold separately than if they are kept together .
