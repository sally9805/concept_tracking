We celebrate ourselves and sing ourselves . We 've sung ourselves so often we may have forgotten the reasons why . Open your eyes and take it in . The quiet little towns sit like drowsy dogs at the sides of the rivers . The city office buildings mirror one another in walls of blackened glass . Sing airport noises , freeway noises and broad smiles and arm-wrestling matches in a Minnesota diner with the President watching Rocky on T.V. and Bix Beiderbecke tooting blues in the corner . How about them Mets ? O Kissinger . O Cher . The bellowing variety , the great mixed bag of nations . Of course we celebrate ourselves . The fact of our existence is reason enough to shout . <P> But can you pin it down precisely ? In a week or two , a hundred million citizens will be cooing at the Statue of Liberty and popping Chinese firecrackers like machine guns far away . Another Fourth . Can anyone say why , exactly , we think we 're something special ? After all , the Chinese made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the world once too ( not that we really do ) . In a heavenly accounting , those civilizations could provide a hefty list of what they offered to the world . If St. Peter asked Americans what they have offered , what would we say ? Do car phones count ? <P> In fact , the list of contributions is impressive , if something of a mess . We have our inventiveness to celebrate , our efficiency , the dollars . Old pluck and luck , hard work , can do . We have our generosity to celebrate , our respect for the rights of others , fair play  --  in principle , if not always in our conduct . We celebrate the principle . National good nature ; we have that to think about as well , and laughter at ourselves . " Do n't get the idea that I 'm one of these goddam radicals . Do n't get the idea that I 'm knocking the American system , " said Al Capone . Celebrate the contradiction , the ironies . Celebrate the changes : the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whorehouse becomes the church . Celebrate the mobility , that we are a people in perpetual motion , whose motion is not aimlessness but optimism . A dreamy lot .
