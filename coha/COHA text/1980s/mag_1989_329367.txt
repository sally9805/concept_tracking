With Butch Cassidy peddling popcorn and salad dressing , it was only a matter of time before the Sundance Kid got into the act . This week Robert Redford , 52 , is launching a line of products and condiments in a new mail-order catalog with a Southwestern flavor . Titled Sundance , the 36-page catalog offers such Native American and regional specialties as dried wildflower bouquets ( $25 ) , chili wreaths ( $36 ) and handmade cowboy boots ( $299 ) . <P> The proceeds will go to Redford 's Utah-based , nonprofit Sundance Institute for the Arts and an environmental group he started , the Institute for Resource Management . Explains Gary Beer , 38 , president of Sundance Group : " Government funding for the arts is down , and we 'd like to be self-sufficient . " While consumers may be hungry for Redford 's hot sauce ( $25 ) , the Great Waldo Pepper will have to sell a lot of chili to match beans with L.L. Bean .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
