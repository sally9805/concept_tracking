Small states seem to be important to superpowers largely in terms of their strategic location or military potential . As in the case of Iceland , this can lead to a dependency relationship in which the smaller state is forced to acquiesce , but which it perceives as contrary to its real interests . Iceland has never and does not now maintain armed forces . Upon joining NATO in 1949 , Iceland reaffirmed its intention neither to raise an army nor to maintain military forces of any kind . Largely because of this apparent contradiction , Iceland is frequently perceived as a ' ' reluctant ally . ' ' When Icelanders have such little interest in things military , many must wonder why Iceland belongs to a military alliance. // The 1949 acceptance of NATO membership was a contentious decision involving a dramatic change in Icelandic security and foreign policy perspective . In 1945 it was clearly the intention of the Icelandic government to return to a security policy based on neutrality . As the cold war developed , the international security environment was not conducive to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeking security in the concept of collective security . As events in Eastern Europe unfolded and Soviet intentions became more intelligible in the West , Iceland showed some interest in participating in the formation of a Scandanavian defense pact . After this idea collapsed , and it became obvious that the UN could not insure the sovereignty of small states , Iceland became a founding member of NATO . Thus in a brief span of four years , Iceland experimented with three approaches for guaranteeing security. // To understand Icelandic defense psychology , it is important to realize that military alliance was viewed as a last resort. // Since World War II , Iceland ' s foreign policy has been designed to prevent external domination by either superpower . Although a member of NATO , Iceland ' s perceptions of threat to national security are not dominated by fear of Soviet military capability . Nordic Europe in general and Iceland in particular disagree with the larger , military powers in NATO over the primary values threatened and the best policy approach likely to protect core values . In Iceland the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillars : ( 1 ) maintenance of a broad social consensus for government , ( 2 ) continued economic growth , ( 3 ) development of a stable welfare system , and ( 4 ) maintenance of a regional balance of power at the lowest possible level of military activity. // Superpowers , in contrast , think of ' ' threat ' ' more readily in terms of military-strategic variables . For the US , the maintenance of a strategic balance with the Soviet Union is seen as a prerequisite for national security . In terms of the global strategic balance , the Nordic region is considered crucial by both superpowers . Unfortunately for the smaller and militarily weaker Nordic European states , the superpowers tend to disregard the nonmilitary but nevertheless vital security interests of the smaller states. // Icelanders sense threats from the Soviets only when they are the result of overt actions and unambiguously convey danger to Icelandic security . This is not a trivial observation . It indicates that Icelanders do not perceive an inherent ideological or systemic military threat to be constantly emitting from the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation to defense is that the history , culture , and core values upon which Icelanders evaluate threats to national security seem constantly to be in conflict with their present geopolitical circumstances . Icelanders are told that the Soviets are the enemy . They feel instinctively that the real sources of threat lie elsewhere . In many respects , the values Icelanders cherish most are threatened by the measures deemed necessary for physical defense. // Small states are inherently deficient in most of the commonly recognized elements of national power . Of necessity , they are driven to consider different options for furthering their interests in the global political arena . For superpowers , force is frequently a possible option . For weak states such as Iceland , there is a shared feeling that real security requires a conscious policy of deemphasizing force in political relationships. // Because they lack sufficient capability in those elements which traditionally comprise national power , small states tend to be vulnerable in a greater number of areas . Economically , they may depend on a single industry such as fishing or a single resource such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dangerous when cast in economic terms . Many small states have recently gained independence , and consequently are especially sensitive to actions which might be perceived as infringing on national sovereignty . Because they lack a sufficient military instrument , they may , like Iceland , be drawn to a collective security framework . The opportunity cost they risk is that the threat perceptions of those possessing the military instrument may clash with their nonmilitary , but no less vital , security concerns. // The lesson should be clear . A search for a stable strategic consensus in regions of the world deemed vital to US security based only or largely on a single-minded perception of Soviet threat will fail . Strategic consensus so narrowly based will be inherently unstable due to differing perceptions of the Soviet threat and unanswered concerns over more highly valued national interests. // If the US wishes to form a stable strategic consensus with strategically located smaller states , the context of that consensus must be broadened beyond a simplistic anti-Soviet focus . We must at least offer the prospect that nonmilitary security fears will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
