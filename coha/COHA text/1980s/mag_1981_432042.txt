 | In his penetrating review of the biography of Edith Piaf by her half sister , Virgil Thomson lists the following events in one twelve-year stretch of the great singer 's life : one suicide attempt , four auto accidents , four drug cures , three comas from liver disease , two bronchial pneumonias , seven operations , an inoperable cancer , two attacks of the D.T. 's and one attack of just plain " raving madness . " When Piaf died in 1963 at the age of 47 , the church forbade a funeral Mass because of her sinful life , which was nonetheless acclaimed by 40,000 fans who broke through the barriers at the cemetery . It is this life that is celebrated in Pam Gems 's Piaf and embodied in the extraordinary performance of Jane Lapotaire as the " little sparrow " of the Paris slums who transformed herself into a smudged and soaring nightingale . Lapotaire 's award-winning performance is the jewel of the Royal Shakespeare Company 's production , which was a great London success both at the RSC and later in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , but rather an episodic collage that flings the main events of Piaf 's life at you in stark , sharp scenes punctuated by a number of her characteristic songs . It may well be that this form was more comfortable in the original confines of the RSC 's small Warehouse theater , where the audience feels the impact and intimacy of the " close-up " style developed by " Piaf 's " director , Howard Davies , the artistic director of the Warehouse . In a Broadway theater , the cabaret style of " Piaf " loses some of its tension , and it would pack more wallop as a tight , driving one-acter without any intermission . But Gems 's writing has power and velocity ; " Piaf " leaps at us right from the gutter , where the scrambling , foul-mouthed little whore and street singer is spotted by a homosexual club owner who gives her her first break as a performer . Like tabloid sheets roaring out of a press , the scenes snapshoot Piaf 's chaotic and feverish life : the club owner 's murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ? pimps , agents , lovers ? among whom she ricochets on her way to becoming the world 's most highly paid singer ; her stint for the Resistance in World War II ; her love for the great boxer Marcel Cerdan and friendship with Marlene Dietrich ; her Carnegie Hall triumph in the United States ; the boozing , morphine-shooting , illnesses , accidents , beatings , betrayals and triumphs . The profanity and some scatological scenes will shock some people , but they challenge the implications of the current taste for gossip journalism and muckraking interest in celebrities . When Piaf , grinning like a mischievous child , seems to urinate onstage , this is n't the bland titillation we get from a Rona Barrett ; Gems is showing the mocking , indecorous pugnacity of a wounded street animal who was born to snarl but learned to sing . Tragic Clown : This is the best part of " Piaf " ? the instant transformations from the messy life to the rigor and discipline of a powerful artist . Lapotaire ( who had never before sung onstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authentically " French " voice loaded with emotion and thought . In Piaf 's famous baggy black dress , her arms akimbo or shooting with sudden ecstasy to the sky , Lapotaire looks like one of Rouault 's tragic clowns come to life . Like a blend of Billie Holiday and Judy Garland , she pours forth a lyrical wisdom about life and love . Her cockney accent , used to drive home the working-class roots of Piaf 's life and art , dissolves to perfect French and English in a moving evocation of the power of art to transform experience . Lapotaire 's electrifying performance is strongly supported by the impudent exuberance of the other RSC performer in the cast , Zoe Wanamaker , as Toine , Piaf 's fellow navigator of the Paris gutters . After fourteen years on the English stage and television , Lapotaire ( the French name belongs to her stepfather ) has become a star . She 'll be seen next in both England and America as Cleopatra in Jonathan Miller 's television production of " Antony and Cleopatra .
