 | Long the pre-eminent evening-news anchor , Dan Rather is having a bit of a career crisis . He has spent the summer feeling trapped by the oddities of the TV business . " The CBS Evening News " is sliding in the Nielsen ratings from its once commanding lead , and he believes he must shoulder the blame : " I always hate it when people say , The ref beat us ' . " But Rather also knows that the ratings system is a mess ? it is being changed completely by the A.C. Nielsen Co. in September ? and that declining viewership of his broadcast may have nothing to do with him personally . All of which makes his reaction to his predicament odder still : so far this month , Rather has changed his on-air delivery from intense to studied mellow to somewhere in between . The CBS News anchor seems a bit spooked , perhaps by all the recent turmoil at his company : " When you go through large-scale layoffs , bad publicity , management changes , I 'd have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in some ways . " But he says the intensity he brings to the air is nothing new . " I 've been told for my whole career , You 're a hot person in a cool medium and you 're not going to make it ' . " Rather has made it , all right , but he admits that he suffers when he acts contrary to his natural instincts . So why throw in new ( sometimes hokey ) closing lines and different delivery styles ? " Rather 's a worker and a learner and I 'll listen to people when they say , Here 's how you can improve ' , " Rather says . Improving the ratings , however , may have nothing to do with any of that . CBS is currently languishing behind NBC ( and sometimes ABC ) for reasons that may be beyond Rather 's control . " We lose in the morning , we lose with CBS-owned stations whose local news shows , leading into Rather , are performing poorly , we lose in prime time , we lose overnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast ? ' he says with a touch of exasperation . Journalistic heft : With first-rate correspondents and a solid mix of stories on the program , some CBS executives are beginning to wonder if the answer might be Rather himself . There are rumors that Diane Sawyer , now at " 60 Minutes , " will assume major anchoring responsibilities . Sawyer herself has no record of obtaining high ratings . And going into an election year , some CBS news executives do not think she has the journalistic heft necessary to replace Rather . But a sharing of anchor duties has not been ruled out . " I 'll do whatever is best for the broadcast , " Rather says . CBS president Laurence Tisch , a fan of Sawyer , may end up helping him make up his mind . In the meantime , " The CBS Evening News " is changing its sound effects , shopping for a new commentator and sticking with Dan Rather . His live interviewing skills are less polished than those of NBC 's Tom Brokaw and ABC 's Peter Jennings . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he remains strong at synthesizing and clarifying a breaking news story ? still the principal requirements of an anchor in a crisis .
