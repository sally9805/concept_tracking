Just 11 weeks before the 686-member Electoral College meets to choose the country ' s first civilian President in two decades , a majority of state governors belonging to the official Democratic Social Party have backed Mr. Neves , a 74-year-old former Governor of Minas Gerais. // The latest endorsements , which President Joao Baptista Figueiredo called opportunistic , came amid charges that campaign managers of the party ' s official candidate , Paulo Salim Maluf , had tried to buy votes and were seeking a secret ballot in the Electoral College. // They also coincided with mounting evidence of nervousness among senior army officers at the prospect of an opposition victory . One Brazilian newspaper reported this week that plans had already been drawn up to declare an emergency in Brasilia when the college meets on Jan. 15 to prevent demonstrations and live broadcasts of the vote. // The governing party theoretically has a 36-seat majority over the combined opposition parties in the college . But by July , some 60 party leaders , including Vice President Aureliano Chaves , had decided to back Mr. Neves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Maluf . <> <> Campaign Style Is Criticized // // Mr. Neves ' s success in winning support from groups as diverse as the Brazilian Communist Party and Sao Paulo ' s powerful Federation of Industrialists has been attributed both to his fatherly middle-of-the-road image and to the strong opposition stirred by Mr. Maluf. // Mr. Maluf , a wealthy 53-year-old businessman and former Governor of Sao Paulo , has been criticized primarily for his campaign style , which has included open use of his family ' s fortune to woo party delegates and Electoral College members with flattery , promises and favors. // In a statement on the election this week , Brazil ' s Conference of Bishops denounced " bribes , self-interested promises , the purchase of votes , mistaken claims of party loyalty , unjust and threatening pressures on members of the Electoral College , violation of the rules of the game and lies - in one word , corruption. " // The statement was interpreted as direct criticism of efforts by the Figueiredo Government and Mr. Maluf to win despite the candidate ' s low standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69. 5 percent for Mr. Neves , according to the latest poll - and the disapproval of much of the ruling party. // So far only 3 of the party ' s 13 state governors have backed Mr. Maluf while 8 have indicated either publicly or privately that they prefer Mr. Neves . In addition , one announced that he would not endorse Mr. Maluf and the other is still calling for direct elections. // Although the governors have no vote , they are influential in choosing the 6 delegates from each of Brazil ' s 23 states who will join 479 federal deputies and 69 senators in the Electoral College . Mr. Neves is assured of the support of delegates from 10 states with opposition governors . <> <> Some Angry Exchanges // // The selection process in states formally controlled by the governing party is already stirring angry exchanges . When the Maranhao state legislature selected six pro-Maluf delegates Thursday , the presence of armed federal police outside the chamber prompted the opposition to walk out . One dissident Government legislator , Jose Sarney Filho , whose father is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulo Maluf would do this with the country : armed police outside Congress and corruption inside. " // But in Piaui , Ceara , Bahia , Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte - all states with Democratic Social Party governors opposed to Mr. Maluf - the vote favored Mr. Neves . Gov . Roberto Magalhaes of Pernambuco said local legislators had " resisted the worst of challenges - the challenge of intrigue , of co-optation , of bribes. " // On Thursday , Mario Juruna , an opposition member of Congress from Rio de Janeiro who is the only Indian in the body , charged that Mr. Maluf ' s campaign manager , Calim Eid , had already given him 30 million cruzeiros - some $12 , 000 - and had promised 370 million cruzeiros more - $148 , 000 - for his vote in the Electoral College . Mr. Eid denied the accusation and said he had turned down Mr. Juruna ' s offer to sell his vote . <> <> Hostility From the Public // // The continuing controversy around Mr. Maluf is feeding the hostility that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed several well-attended meetings in state capitals , Mr. Maluf has attracted demonstrators and hecklers . Last week , shots were fired in the air and tear gas was used to break up a crowd protesting against Mr. Maluf in Brasilia. // In many cities , bumper stickers , buttons and T-shirts are on sale not only proclaiming " Tancredo NOW " - an allusion to the " Direct Elections NOW " campaign that was blocked by the military Government this year - but also denouncing Mr. Maluf in less than respectful terms . Pro-Maluf slogans are hard to find. // Eager to recover some momentum for his campaign , Mr. Maluf has tried to exploit the armed forces ' deep suspicion of leftist groups by stressing the Communist support for Mr. Neves . The Government has also begun harassing members of several Communist factions that are illegal but normally tolerated . In response , Mr. Neves has urged leftist groups not to be provocative by waving red flags at campaign meetings . He has also tried to avoid an open confrontation with the Government. // Rather , having supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brazilians onto the streets this year , Mr. Neves ' s principal promise has been to dismantle the Electoral College and call direct elections for 1988 under a new Constitution to be written by the Congress that is elected in 1986. // //
