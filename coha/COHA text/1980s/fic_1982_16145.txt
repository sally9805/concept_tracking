Prologue BLACK . We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer . &nbsp; FRANCES ( v.o . ) No one ever came up to me and said , You 're a fool . There is n't such a thing as God . Somebody 's been stuffing you. FADE IN : 1 EXT . PUGET SOUND - DAY On an expanse of water , calm and undisturbed . After a moment , it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface . A girl 's face breaks through . &nbsp; FRANCES ( v.o . ) It was n't a murder . I think God just died of old age . And when I realized He was n't any more , it did n't shock me . It seemed natural and right . The girl , FRANCES , is 16 , blond , very pretty : she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God 's existence . She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes . . . then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach . &nbsp; FRANCES ( v.o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister meant when he said , God , the Father , sees even the smallest sparrow fall . He watches over all his children. That jumbled it all up for me. 2 EXT . PUGET SOUND - LATER The banks of Puget Sound , dotted with elm trees . Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary . Towel around her neck , her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun . &nbsp; FRANCES ( v.o . ) But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember , especially when I lost things that were important . Please God , let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings. 3 INT . FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING Frances is now reading aloud from her diary , gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair . An older woman , LILLIAN FARMER , sits opposite on the couch , listening and nodding from time to time . A small suitcase stands by the front door .  --  3  --  &nbsp; FRANCESIt usually worked . God became a superfather that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing badly enough , He arranged it . ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates , listening to his daughter read . &nbsp; FRANCES ( cont 'd ) But if God loved all of His children equally , why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always ? Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head . She looks at him briefly , smiling slightly . &nbsp; ERNESTBye , baby . &nbsp; FRANCESSee you next weekend , Dad . He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase , glances at Lillian . She does n't look up . He leaves . &nbsp; FRANCESI began to see that He did n't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything . They happened whether He wanted them to or not , and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice . DISSOLVE TO : 4 INT . AUDITORIUM - DAY Frances stands at a podium . Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit to either side of her on folding chairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Below that a banner hangs : " NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION , 1931 . " &nbsp; FRANCESI wondered a little why God was such a useless thing . It seemed a waste of time to have Him . After that He became less and less , until He was . . . . nothingness . The AUDIENCE consists of parents , students , and local dignitaries . We SEE several shocked faces . Lillian is there also , smiling . Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman , ALMA STYLES . Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium , looking a little worried . &nbsp; FRANCESI felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself , without help from anyone . It puzzled me that other ( MORE )  --  4  --  &nbsp; FRANCES ( cont 'd ) people had n't found out , too . God was gone . We had reached past Him . Why could n't they see it ? It still puzzles me . Frances closes her notebook and looks up , waiting for some response . There is a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claps enthusiastically , then rises to her feet . In the back a WOMAN also stands . &nbsp; WOMANYou 're going straight to hell , Frances Farmer ! A stately man sitting next to her , her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN HILLIER , puts a restraining hand on her arm . The woman continues to glare at Frances . Frances stares back , dumbfounded . SMASH CUT TO : Section Details 5 EXT . SEATTLE STREETS - DAY The screen erupts into violence . A large unruly MOB skirmishes with POLICE in a cobblestoned square . On a truckbed addressing the crowd - which carries placards reading : " Organize Now ! " , " Workers of the World Unite ! " , and " Elect Kaminski ! " stands MARTONI KAMINSKI . By his side , leading the crowd 's responses , stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes , HARRY YORK . &nbsp; KAMINSKIAnd do you think it 's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family ? &nbsp; YORK &amp; CROWDNo ! &nbsp; KAMINSKIIs it radical for you to have a hand in shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; YORK &amp; CROWDNo ! &nbsp; KAMINSKIIs it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country ? &nbsp; YORK &amp; CROWDNo !

City Hall steps .

What child has n't questioned the Lord 's mysteries in order to better understand them ? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire , I may not agree with what she says , but I 'll defend to the death her right to say it . Freedom of speech , unlike in the dark countries to the east , still lives in America ! And in my home . Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema , we SEE Frances and her father .

I 'll give it a try , Mr. York . &nbsp; HARRYHarry . &nbsp; FRANCES ( hesitates , nods ) Harry . They half-smile , awkwardly , as if neither really wants this encounter to end . Then Harry doffs his hat . &nbsp; HARRYBye . She nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house . &nbsp; HARRY ( admiring her ) Sure do n't walk like sixteen , neither . Section Details 8 INT .

As her attorney , I 've known her for years . &nbsp; HILLIERWhat about the father , he 's a little pink . Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light , shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals . &nbsp; STYLES ( shaking her head ) He 's no influence ; he does n't even live at home . No , I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended . It was her teacher who entered it in the competition . &nbsp; HILLIERWell , the publicity must stop . It 's no good for Seattle and no good for the country . ( sternly ) Keep an eye on this , will you , Alma ? &nbsp; STYLESOf course , your honor . He nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in .

The walls are corrugated tin nailed to bare wood framing . The place looks like an enormous tool shed . The SOUND OF GARBLED VOICES and SCREAMING never stops . These are the forgotten ones . . . beyond hope . Everyone here has lost any notion of what they might have once been . Their faces are slack , only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity . Some wander aimlessly about , unheeding of others who are pushing , kicking and screaming  --  121  --  at them . Many squat in the dirt by the walls , mired in their own urine and excrement , chanting wordlessly to themselves . Some appear lifeless , their prone bodies shoved out of the way . Some women are involved in violent sex with themselves or each other , some in mindless fist-fights . In a far corner we SEE a group of men in various military and medical uniforms , their backs to us , facing the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joking , slapping each other on the back .

A SOLDIER , his pants down around his ankles , is squirming violently on top of her . Frances ' eyes are open but glazed , her face turned away from her attacker . She is passive and unresisting . She is reciting to herself , over and over . &nbsp; FRANCESWe shall hear the angels , we shall see the whole sky all diamonds . . .

HARLINGTON ( o.s . ) One merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe , manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain . The lights are bright , on her and the other patients . We can not see , but we sense , an audience watching . &nbsp; DR . HARLINGTON ( o.s . ) Because of the speed and simplicity of the operation , I am able , as you are seeing , to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour . Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling . It 's moving round and round . The voice drones on . &nbsp; DR .

Frances turns and stares mutely , without emotion , at what 's happening next to her : the leucotome ( an ice-pick-like instrument ) is inserted into a woman 's eye socket . . . . &nbsp; DR . HARLINGTONThis procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli . It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment . The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted . &nbsp; DR . HARLINGTONIn plain language , my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas . Along with the cure comes a loss of affect . . . a kind of emotional flattening . . . Frances turns away and stares at the fan again . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  124  --  &nbsp; DR .
