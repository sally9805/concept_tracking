Senate Democrats want to attach similar legislation to a bill pending on the Senate floor that would raise the national debt limit . If adopted by Congress , the War Powers measure would require President Reagan to withdraw troops within 60 days unless Congress authorizes their continued presence. // Early in the day , the Senate approved an amendment to a supplementary spending bill commending the troops who had fought in Grenada. // // Deal on Refugees Sought // Tonight , an amendment was offered to the debt ceiling bill that would urge the President to bar the return of Cuban prisoners seized in Grenada until Cuba agreed to take back undesirable refugees sent to the United States during the boatlift of 1980. // Senator Lawton Chiles , a Florida Democrat , in offering the amendment , said the deal was necessary because Cuba had refused to take back the refugees . He said 6 , 000 of them were now in American jails . A vote on the Chiles amendment will come on Friday. // Personal criticism of Mr. Reagan was muted both by uncertainty over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might present evidence in his television speech of Cuban and Soviet influence on the island . Accordingly , some lawmakers focused on the more legalistic issue of the War Powers Resolution . <> <> Mood in Congress Is Uneasy // But the mood of Congress remained uneasy , with members voicing two basic concerns : that the danger to American citizens , used to justify the invasion , had not been demonstrated , and that the invasion had clouded the United States ' moral leadership. // At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the Deputy Secretary of State , Kenneth W. Dam , said it was " highly unlikely " that troops would remain in Grenada for 60 days . Accordingly , Mr. Dam said , the Administration felt it was not necessary to apply the War Powers Resolution. // But lawmakers remain suspicious of the Administration ' s motives and feel that the law should be invoked. // " Frankly , I don ' t trust them , " said Senator Gary Hart , Democrat of Colorado , who is the chief sponsor of the War Powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Administration that is not inclined to obey the law . They can always find an excuse to stay in Grenada , and they very clearly do not want to be bound by the 60-day limit. " // Similar concerns were voiced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee , where the bill to apply the War Powers Resolution was passed . Representative Peter H. Kostmayer , a Pennsylvania Democrat , told the committee that the issue was whether the invasion was " necessary or right " . // " The Administration , " he said , " has not demonstrated that their action was necessary , and they have not demonstrated , morally or ethically , that it was right. " // Some Republicans and Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee defended the invasion , even while agreeing that the War Powers Resolution should be invoked. // Representative William S. Broomfield of Michigan , the ranking Republican , said medical students returning from Grenada had been " very elated " at the intervention of American forces and , as a result , the action could prove to be " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascell Defends President // Representative Dante B. Fascell of Florida , the ranking Democrat , said : // " I have concluded that it was absolutely essential for the President to take the action he took. " // Mr. Fascell said he based his judgment on the fact that other Caribbean nations had requested help and that the new Grenadian regime had demonstrated " brutality. " // Some critics of the invasion said they were discouraged from speaking out because Democratic leaders were unwilling to assail the President at a time when troops were still fighting in Grenada . Mr. Reagan said in his television speech tonight that Democrats had joined with Republicans in telling the world that " we are all Americans before we are anything else. " // But Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. , the leading Democrat in Congress , has said that he will have " plenty to say " as soon as the troops leave. // Lawmakers said they had also hesitated to speak out because of the comments of returning students . These generally welcomed the arrival of the invading American forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies. // The lawmakers added that the students might not have been giving a true picture , but since reporters had been barred from the scene , there was no independent source of information . Moreover , Senator Hart noted , the students had been under fire for two days after the invasion and would naturally be relieved. // " How did they feel before the bullets started flying ? " Senator Hart asked . <> <> Not a ' Shred of Evidence ' // Representative Kostmayer added : " I haven ' t seen a single shred of evidence that American lives were in danger in Grenada. " // Other critics said that the United States had lost the " high moral ground " in the international arena and undermined the credibility of its attacks on Soviet actions in places like Poland and Afghanistan. // " When we engage in actions that do violence to international law and American principles , " said Representative Howard Wolpe , a Michigan Democrat who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee , " we play directly into the hands of those who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , that compromises our political position. " // Senator Charles H. Percy , Republican of Illinois and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , opened the hearing with Deputy Secretary Dam by saying , " I am concerned about the impact of such an operation upon world opinion and the legal justification for our intervention . " <> <> No Withdrawal Date Specified Mr. Dam said the operation could be justified on two grounds : the potential danger to American citizens , and the request by other Caribbean nations for help in restoring order in Grenada . He said the troops would leave " as soon as possible , " but was not specific. // Under questioning by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr . , Democrat of Delaware , Mr. Dam said the first step would be the naming of a prime minister by the Governor General , Sir Paul Scoon , who is the Queen ' s titular representative in this British Commonwealth country. // //
