To President Ferdinand E. Marcos , seven is a lucky number . Members of the 200-seat National Assembly were well aware of that last week as they witnessed the introduction of Cabinet Bill No. 7 , the enabling legislation for snap presidential elections that the Filipino leader announced earlier this month . The bill proposed an unusual length for the campaign : 57 days . In place of the Jan. 17 election date that Marcos had initially suggested for the balloting , Bill No. 7 proposed another one : Feb. 7 . Admitted the President 's Political Affairs Minister , Leonardo Perez : " We are superstitious . " <P> The move showed Marcos at his wiliest . The new election date allowed the President to claim magnanimity for allowing opposition parties more time to prepare for the contest . It was flexibility he could well afford : last week Marcos ' civilian opponents appeared to be more deeply divided than ever . Only days after leading Opposition Figures Corazon ( " Cory " ) Aquino and Salvador ( " Doy " ) Laurel made a public display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to split over the issue of who should run against the President . <P> Mrs. Aquino , 52 , widow of martyred Opposition Leader Benigno ( " Ninoy " ) Aquino , has long been considered the candidate most capable of uniting all elements of the splintered democratic resistance to Marcos . Until recently , she had insisted she would not run . In late October , however , the soft-spoken leader said she might step forward if her supporters collected 1 million signatures backing her candidacy . Now speculation is rife in Manila that the deeply religious Mrs. Aquino may be on the verge of opposing Marcos on the election ballot . <P> Aquino 's shifting position seemed to disconcert Laurel , whose United Nationalist Democratic Organization holds 37 of the 59 opposition seats in the National Assembly . The former senator declared himself a presidential candidate last June . Some form of Aquino-Laurel ticket has long been considered a strong combination , but Laurel , who turned 57 last week , has frequently , if somewhat unconvincingly , said he would step aside should another figure be chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Aquino among opposition leaders , Laurel abruptly demanded the resignation of Cecilia Munoz Palma , 73 , head of the twelve-party organization known as the National Unification Committee , a body charged with hammering out the opposition ticket . Fumed Laurel : " You have shown partiality . You are a dictator . Why do n't you resign now ? " Munoz Palma complied , declaring , " I can now really speak my mind on who can lead the Filipino people . " The two later made up , but by then a seven-party coalition had formed to press for Aquino 's candidacy .
