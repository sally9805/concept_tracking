Scene one . A lavish penthouse apartment somewhere in northern Virginia . Fireplace . Door to bedroom . Door to hallway . A staircase leading to the roof garden . A large sofa with matching end tables . An upright piano . All these furnishings are of the most exquisite kind , and arranged with a decorator 's eye . The immense window looks out on several other high rises . The cat burglar , BLAISE , enters in near darkness through an air-conditioning vent , which he knocks out . He is dressed in black , wears a black mask and black gloves . He looks around at various objects , including candlesticks , a stereo , some small bronzes and porcelains arranged on shelves , but seems pleased with nothing . This continues for several minutes , but his search is in vain . There 's simply nothing here worth the trouble . He looks in the liquor cabinet and finds a bottle of bourbon . With bottle in hand , he ambles over to the piano and sits down . Drinks . Bangs out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a rag . Stops suddenly , as if listening for a noise . Another drink . Now he launches into the main rag , playing with great enthusiasm , and even vocalizing with the music . Suddenly he slams the piano closed , wipes off his fingerprints , and bolts behind the sofa . Pause . He peers over the sofa , rushes over to the piano , grabs the bottle , and wiggles out the air-conditioning vent . Pause . Blackout. @x Scene two . The penthouse . MEGAN and DEBORAH talk in an animated fashion . Windows of other apartments are visible . A piece of twilight sky . MEGAN He 's coming . Really , he 's coming . DEBORAH Again ? MEGAN No , silly girl , not him . Don . DEBORAH Don who ? MEGAN Ramon 's friend . After all , with Sam gone we need someone to cheer you up . DEBORAH I expect you 've heard the good news . MEGAN Is n't it wonderful ? DEBORAH An idea like that . After all this time . After all our doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful time when it 's begun . DEBORAH I 'll say . Can pack up my books and stuff it . MEGAN Pardon me , Debby . She picks up phone and dials.Hello . Everything all right ? DOG barks . She goes to the window . DOG appears in the window opposite , phone in hand , and waves . MEGAN waves back and hangs up.Would you like a drink ? p. 4 DEBORAH Sure , a scotch would be nice . MEGAN A neighbor in the next building . Going through a rough time . Family trouble . A bit depressed . So I call up every now and then . Hands the drink to DEBORAH . DEBORAH Are n't you sweet . MEGAN People have to help out . It 'll be different , soon . DEBORAH I expect we 'll get used to the light . MEGAN When the statues come to life DEBORAH When the statues come to life you know what I 'm going to do ? MEGAN Throw away your glasses and buy a boutique DEBORAH Throw away my law books is more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your mind . DEBORAH Not really , Megan . MEGAN I 've been grinning from ear to ear . Inside . Since I 've heard the news . I 've grown so fond of you , Deborah . Do you know how the world was created ? Seriously , do you ? DEBORAH Just like it is now , I would imagine . MEGAN No , it was created , according to an Egyptian myth , by an enormous dung beetle  --  scarab , it 's called  --  who went about rolling , and kneading , and rolling this gigantic ball of shit , until it got bigger and bigger and bigger . Then it got quite out of hand . And so on . While MEGAN talks , DEBORAH spies a pair of woman 's gloves and picks them up . p. 5 DEBORAH I did n't know you had invited her . MEGAN I did n't . She invited herself . Rude creature . DEBORAH In that case . Gets up to go . MEGAN No , please stay . DEBORAH You should know better than to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all our good fortune . Where is she ? MEGAN In the bedroom . Passed out . Really , it was n't my doing . Musing.Times being what they are . DEBORAH Not to mention our exceeding good fortune . Looks out the window.What are they doing down there ? MEGAN Expect a little commotion of some kind . A celebration , perhaps in honor of the coming . The light is thrilling is n't it ? After all these years , just as I was beginning to doubt . DEBORAH I ca n't imagine you doubting , Megan . MEGAN Oh yes , I 've had my moments . Never talk much about them . Do n't see much point in complaining . DEBORAH And now it 's not necessary . MEGAN So now the future shall be just like the past . Musing.A happy throng of carefree peasantry Or something like a pageant . p. 6 DEBORAH I hardly have the language for what I feel . Not that I 'm worried , mind you . MEGAN You always were so gloomy , dear . DEBORAH But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my avocation . That 's why I 'm so An awkward pause . DEBORAH Articulate . I understand . MEGAN The sky is wonderful , is n't it ? DEBORAH Looks so real it almost looks fake . MEGAN A remarkable effect DEBORAH Whatever are they doing down there ? MEGAN Playing stickball with a human head , ah , here she comes . She 's awake . Tidies up . DEBORAH I promise to be good . MEGAN Oh , you have changed , Debby . Both look expectantly to the bedroom door . Pause . Blackout. @x Scene three . The same . JOHN SLEIGHT has joined DEBORAH and MEGAN . All three walk about casually , drinking and smoking . JOHN SLEIGHT The big change came later when the banks began to understand my work . Pause.They found that by simply making nothing happen they could advance their own interests as well as mine . All things come to those who wait . Money is time , and empty time is the most valuable because it costs nothing , involves no risky transactions with leftist regimes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer tie-in . If you plug into the system you survive , if you do n't , you do n't . Pause.It was this , in essence , I was trying to tell Sam all along , but he was too stubborn . Committed to an outworn creed . A spiritual aborigine , so to speak . DEBORAH Must you mention his name ? MEGAN I was just going to say the same thing . Something strange happens . SLEIGHT looks puzzled . They go back to where they were at the beginning of the scene . JOHN SLEIGHT The big change came later when the banks began to understand my work . Pause.They found that by simply making nothing happen they could advance their own interests as well as mine . All things come to those who wait . Money is time , and empty time is the most valuable because it costs nothing , involves no risky transactions with leftist regimes or desperate small entrepreneurs . It can all be done by computer tie-in . If you plug into the system you survive , if you do n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was trying to tell Sam all along , but he was too stubborn . Committed to an outworn creed . A spiritual aborigine , so to speak . p. 8 MEGAN Must you mention his name ? DEBORAH I was just going to say the same thing . JOHN SLEIGHT That was nearly perfect . He looks at his watch and screams . He does a pratfall and lies motionless . A bluish fluid pours down one wall , changing its color . A red carpet rolls out from the bedroom . GUZMAN appears in the fireplace and enters . MEGAN Oh , Ramon , it 's so good of you . RAMON GUZMAN ( To DEBORAH . ) Charmed . MEGAN This is Deborah . RAMON GUZMAN I am delighted to make your acquaintance . She spits in his face and sits with her back to the audience . MEGAN Ramon , this is John Sleight . DEBORAH ( Mimicking her . ) I 'm not sure you 've met . She giggles . MEGAN This is an exercise of Mr. Sleight 's . It 's called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really . May I get you a drink ? SLEIGHT remains motionless on the floor . RAMON GUZMAN Yes , Megan , I would like that . p. 9 MEGAN John , wo n't you say hello to Mr. Guzman ? RAMON GUZMAN Do not disturb him on my account . MEGAN We were just discussing the good news . RAMON GUZMAN You mean the chiasmus in the time-fabric potentiated by the isochronometric instigator ? DEBORAH Of course , idiot . RAMON GUZMAN Where shall we be dining ? MEGAN The club , of course . RAMON GUZMAN It might be fun to get out and go to the theater for a change . DEBORAH tries to stifle wild laughter.Do something different . Awkward pause . SLEIGHT is recovering.They 're all these warm-hearted revivals going on nowadays . Quite reassuring . DEBORAH breaks up again. I am particularly fond of this play about the mountain of styrofoam I am reading about . This fantastic pile of ice and stone and prehistoric merds is inhabited by some people who are lost . They discover meaning in their lostness and are reminiscing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to tiny fragments . Quite moving theater . MEGAN Not on an empty stomach , Ramon. p. 10 RAMON GUZMAN Will Hilary be arriving soon ? JOHN SLEIGHT ( Getting up . ) Soon enough , Mr. Guzman . RAMON GUZMAN Ah , you are recovered . JOHN SLEIGHT A taste of death is a fine tonic , sir . RAMON GUZMAN A medicine to be administered in small doses , John . MEGAN Mr. Guzman is such a wit . Pause.Can I get you something , John ? Pause.Debby , what about you ? Why do n't you join us ? DEBORAH Hilary wo n't be coming . MEGAN What a strange thing to say . Of course she will . DEBORAH Because she does n't exist . MEGAN What nonsense , Ramon . Ignore her . DEBORAH Ignore me when I speak like that . MEGAN Would you like to see John 's latest ? DEBORAH Oh , I 'd love to . MEGAN Not you , silly . I was asking Ramon . DEBORAH knocks herself on the forehead in mock astonishment and collapses on the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan , I have no interest in such toys . MEGAN Then perhaps I shall go myself . JOHN SLEIGHT ( Pouring himself a drink . ) I was just about to explain , Ramon , how the future can be controlled only by changing it into the past . Traditionally this has been the function of life , but now that mere life has become a far too chancy enterprise for those of us whose cat tracks the pavement singing old Beatles ' dung beetle . One requires a thorn . I assure you , if you look out this window you can hear shapes of your eyesight drilling holes to China . Rearing up dead heaps of dollar bills . Banks going at it , bang-bang ! And cropped photos of famous politicians turned into living turds . My work is called The Bad Infinity ! RAMON GUZMAN It sounds fascinating . Pause . SLEIGHT finishes his drink.You talk as if life were redundant . JOHN SLEIGHT When it works right and the switches mesh , I can conjure up a whole fear picture of picture 's bungo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a bird 's perch where they are dreaming of a television set that can turn itself off . All this reduced to a digital diorama of a video game in which the object of the game is to win points by drinking blood . Or a theater piece based on a video game in which a pair of TVs make love in the mind of a young lady whose lives are recounting in a miniseries as described in an unproduced treatment recycled for TV by video people for a talk show that is aired in the dark . You get me ? It 's safe because it 's blank . p. 12 RAMON GUZMAN It sounds quite mad to me , but if you can make money doing it , why not ? What do you think , Deborah ? DEBORAH For blank read dead . JOHN SLEIGHT You have n't lost your harsh , judging side , have you ? DEBORAH You see this lampshade ? Holds it up . RAMON GUZMAN Whatever are you driving at ? DEBORAH Why do n't you wear it like a hat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MEGAN I 'm going to see the " Work . " Then we 'll go out to the theater . JOHN SLEIGHT Really , I think dinner would be a more appropriate idea . DEBORAH If we do n't go to the theater I 'll hang myself . RAMON GUZMAN Women , these northern women . DEBORAH I 'll hang myself from the rafters and swing back and forth in the wind like a big old beach towel , and the rope will squeal like window hinges . She demonstrates.I 'll hang till the birds pick me clean and then I 'll fly and fly and careen over the city like a mad banshee and I 'll shriek till I deafen all the fine people like you with your wars and money and fine clothes and endless boring technological bullcrap . I will . She grabs a bottle of wine , takes a terrific swig , and pours the rest in a flowerpot . Climbs up on an end table . She places the bottle on her head and begins a malefic jig.A moment of pure jade . Glass between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , life on the run . America . Ameria . Meria . Mericanica . Mercanicamera . Bodiless ordinaria . She freezes.Photograph the photograph of the moon . Pause.You polite asses . Pause.A sea of perpendictables . Perpendictable paper dolls . Pause.See . Look , man . Open your head . She gets no response . She quiets.It 's so like something no one ever saw before . It 's like the sudden appearance and disappearance of a leopard in a snake 's dream . It 's like cooking up a really spectacular meal of raw food starting with garbage . Pause.Oh , the energy that goes into a thing . Horrid . Horrd . Horrd . Hord . Hord . Hrd . Hrd . Hd . Hd . Hd . D. D. D. D. Pause.Take off that lampshade , you fucking clich . He puts it back on the lamp . DEBORAH freezes as a Greek Nike. p. 13 JOHN SLEIGHT Care for a refill , Ramon ? RAMON GUZMAN In the jungle , Sam , we practiced the most unspeakable atrocities on the natives , we did this not out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve ourselves and the world . Bah , you liberals . No , we do this for the hell of it . Yes , for the hell of it . To give us pleasure . Your blood has become thin . You are weak . Simple human joys as , for instance , of torture and slaughter and rapine no longer appeal to your delicate appetites . Amigo , I pity you . JOHN SLEIGHT You underestimate me , Ramon . " Feed the fires of paranoia , " I always say . MEGAN A toast to Intertop . RAMON GUZMAN I rather toast the devil . MEGAN Poor sport . JOHN SLEIGHT By the way , how did you know I was Sam ? RAMON GUZMAN It says so in the program . JOHN SLEIGHT YOU CAN GET OFF THE FUCKING TABLE NOW . DEBORAH I was wondering when you were going to notice me . She gets down . Blackout . Pause . Lights back up . DEBORAH and MEGAN prepare to go see SLEIGHT 's " Work . " JOHN SLEIGHT Actually . I 'm the Pseudo Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . p. 14 RAMON GUZMAN How original . DEBORAH " How original . " She spits in his face on her way out . Blackout. @x Scene four . Darkness . Voices of ROMEO and JULIET from act three , scene five . After a time , silence . Lights come up on two tape recorders on the floor with speakers facing each other , maybe fifteen feet apart . Just behind are two chairs facing each other , with mirrors propped up in both . Otherwise the room is empty . MEGAN and DEBORAH admire from one side , where the former has her finger on the light switch . They are a little drunk by now , and both giggle a lot . MEGAN Quite remarkable , is n't it ? DEBORAH A gas . She burps . Pause . MEGAN Almost a perfect " bad infinity . " DEBORAH Almost ? MEGAN You ca n't really perceive the total effect . You see ? If you stand here , for instance , She stands in between the mirrors.your own image blocks out a small portion of infinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , despite the claims of proud Mr. John Sleight , occludes the unending accordion effect . It only works when no one 's looking at it . DEBORAH That 's pretty much as it should be . MEGAN " Should , " Debby ? p. 16 DEBORAH Sorry . MEGAN The nicest thing about Shakespeare is that his works are a club to beat down our contemporaries . A cudgel . DEBORAH Never thought about it like that . MEGAN My innocence must be rubbing off on you . Scratches herself.I like it here . DEBORAH Shall we rejoin the gentlemen ? MEGAN It 's wonderful , just for a short time , not to see the sky , not to hope or dream . Or wish . Or want . Or know . Or think . Or feel anything . To be entirely vacuous in the presence of the Master , Shakespeare . To be empty and to allow the pure water of his meaningless old-hat dead language to wash over us and make us clean . I want so to be clean . DEBORAH You sound like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You sound like me . MEGAN Shall we go up ? I did n't use " should , " you notice . DEBORAH It 's going to be such an extravagantly wonderful evening . They start out . Blackout . DEBORAH giggles in the dark. @x Scene five . The penthouse . The four seated randomly throughout the room . Motionless . Long pause . RAMON whistles a few bars from " Knickknack , Paddywhack , Give Your Dog a Bone . " Pause . DEBORAH What do you suppose ever happened to Blaise ? All are shocked at the mere idea . The MEN bunker down in their seats . JOHN SLEIGHT What do you suppose ever happened to Sam ? Sky turns purple ; a MAN appears on the wall of the building opposite , scampering like a lizard ; the DOG appears in the window , howling and whining ; on the edge of the roof garden above him a MAN appears with a pair of wings , which he flaps gingerly ; a crowd of people begin leaping from windows and over the edge of the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and falls ; lastly , the DOG flings himself out of the window ; in each case the fall is followed , after a short interval , by a terrible thud . The sky changes to a deep purple . A score or so of plastic WallWalkers appear on the wall opposite , where the first MAN had been scampering . They creep down the wall in typical WallWalker fashion ; MEGAN yawns . MEGAN Shall we go ? They get up and prepare to go out . Blackout. @x Scene six . Before the club . The four stand , holding overcoats , backs to the audience , looking at something in the sky . Former SENATOR ARMITRAGE appears , kneeling on a low dolly , with a handful of pencils , which he is selling . A placard of some kind hangs around his neck . He addresses the audience as the others gaze off into the distance . SENATOR ARMITRAGE Fine people , seekers , all of you , lovers of truth , art , and journalism , tell me , truthfully , what have you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure lust and impure ways ! Suppose you all mean to go in there ? Points to the club.The old club . He cackles.The Alibi Club , it used to be called . Go in at your own risk . Things have changed . They serve human flesh nowadays , and they 're not real particular where it comes from . Be warned . I know : I , too , have flown . I , too , have skimmed the cloud tops . He muses.Simple pleasures and no apology , simple murders , the joy blasted or blasting through solid bedrock to become a firefly . Tipped over . Like a foot scratching another foot . Because our American appetite the happy voice of all the empty land , empty heart , making it full . What the gods were meaningless meaningless He looks around furtively.I am walking up a gradual incline that becomes steep . I am all wind and silence and Pause.Bright , healthy !

I work for my daily blood , bread . I can see the future better than any man , having helped instigate it , by gosh . And I 'm telling you : Do n't go in this place . It 's not safe . It 's crawling with demons , devils , foreigners and monstrosities . The Chef has quit . He 's fled to the forest . He 's fled to the forest to get away . AND DO N'T TOUCH THE FOOD , bah Scornfully.You 're not listening . Pause.You go in there and you 'll pull the trip wire on the most incredible series of bad infinities known to man . Pause.THE HORIZONTAL AVALANCHE ! Pause.The Chef has quit , I tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . He rolls himself off . DEBORAH turns around . p. 19 DEBORAH What did that man say ? MEGAN Shall we go in ? Blackout. @x Scene seven . Total darkness . A squeaking sound , very quiet . Over this , a magisterial VOICE . VOICE Ladies and gentlemen . The sound you hear is the sound of forty-nine million bats . These vicious , feral little monsters are in flight . Perpetual flight . In a space which contains all of you , and all the visible and invisible matter , imaginable or unimaginable . Known or unknown . In the entire universe . This space is roughly ten centimeters on a side and weighs approximately ten and a half sestillion solar masses . You will observe that no light emanates from this space . Pause.Only the cries of forty-nine million bats . Pause.Creatures that have been in flight since the beginning of time and not one full collision has been recorded . Pause.Only the occasional brushing of a wing against a furred ear , or a whisker against a claw . Pause.A bat infinity . Pause.Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing of their wings . Silence. @x Scene eight . In the dining room at the club . The four are preparing to order the main course . The FIRST WAITER is in blackface . DEBORAH is lost in reverie , which is noticed only by SLEIGHT . JOHN SLEIGHT Are you all right , Deb ? MEGAN Waiter , the lumpfish roe is alive . FIRST WAITER Well , fuck my ass . I done beat on it till I thought I kilt it , but I guess I 'll jus ' beat on it some mo ' . FIRST WAITER exits with dish . SECOND WAITER brings on bottles of wine . MEGAN ( Getting up . ) We 're going to see the pit . Are n't we , Ramon ? RAMON GUZMAN ( Getting up . ) Quite , yes . SECOND WAITER French wine He exits . JOHN SLEIGHT There is a thing we aspire to , which is being continually lost , because we do n't see we already possess it . So when we lose it , we do n't even know we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DEBORAH Cut the crap . Sam . JOHN SLEIGHT How did you recognize me ? p. 22 DEBORAH You do n't look like him in the least . JOHN SLEIGHT Do you believe all this " statues-coming-to-life " bullcrap ? DEBORAH Hell no . Intertop 's bankrupt . JOHN SLEIGHT Bullshit . DEBORAH It 's true . I can feel it . JOHN SLEIGHT You 're psychic , I suppose . DEBORAH It 's in the numbers . Actuarial tables . JOHN SLEIGHT I do n't believe it . Look , Deb . He reaches for her . DEBORAH Do n't touch me . Pause.I do n't want to feel anything . It 's too painful . I do n't want to be loved . I want to be feared . I want to destroy everything human in me . I want to become a monument to my own incredulity , and to the vileness and stupidity of the world . Pause.And if you so much as lay a finger on me I 'll scream . So help me I will . He touches her with one finger . Pause.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't be fooled . JOHN SLEIGHT There 's still a chance . DEBORAH How do you mean ? p. 23 JOHN SLEIGHT Shush . They 're coming back . MEGAN and RAMON return . RAMON GUZMAN It is very interesting , Mr. Sleight . You see a big hole with flames licking about in the bottom , and thunders animating the surrounding miasmus . Very extensive , I assure you . Large serpents are writhing in and around large flowerpots and on the parquet . The members of the staff throw live animals , which are torn apart by the creatures of the bottom . The wailing of the voices of the damned is quite something to behold . JOHN SLEIGHT A remarkable feat of engineering . RAMON GUZMAN An amusing display , to say the least . MEGAN I thought Ramon might be intrigued by the new installation . JOHN SLEIGHT Of course the illusion is quite realistic . DEBORAH You know better than me about illusions . MEGAN Shall we order ? I 'm famished . THIRD WAITER rushes out of the kitchen with a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot pursuit . Despite them , he makes it to the table . THIRD WAITER Do n't eat the blood sausage . Collapses and is dragged off by FIRST WAITER . SECOND WAITER comes up to the table . p. 24 MEGAN My word . SECOND WAITER Ignore this man . Is new on staff . Have not learned how to behave . Sorry . He exits . MEGAN Do n't you find the question of behavior quite neglected , Ramon ? The latter becomes immediately agitated . RAMON GUZMAN Ah , yes . But in my opinion the question of behavior is reducible by a process of covert inspissitude to the more profound question of decorum , which is itself a three-dimensional graphic explosion of the two dimensional crystallization of the essential problem , which is the matter of PENMANSHIP . As you know , elegant handwriting has fallen into a state of neglect and disrepair , like the nation 's bridges and highways and viaduct system . This must be remedied by a strict return Rapping his spoon.to fundamentals , as , for instance , the famous curve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused with the waving , wavering , twisted line , and the oblate , hyperbolic curve , which is abominated by the divinities and is , in fact , the Work of the Devil . Pause . " Demons inhabit the intersections of circles , " as the poet tells us . Pause.But , au fond , what is required is discipline . Pause.Otherwise the handwriting becomes personalized , unscrutable , inscrupulous , unreadable , inane , evil . And if the hand come to delight in Portentous pause.eccentricity for eccentricity 's sake Another pause.who knows where next it may find pleasure ? He relaxes.I know my views are old hat , so to say , but they come from the heart . He bows , banging head on the table . p. 25 MEGAN ( To SECOND WAITER . ) Sir , we shall order now . WAITER bows , stalks off without taking their order . MEGAN What do you suppose is wrong with him ? JOHN SLEIGHT Head-wedged syndrome . Quite common . Begins doing push-ups . SECOND WAITER reappears , very nonchalant . MEGAN Pardonne , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already taken order . MEGAN But that is quite impossible . SECOND WAITER No , is truth . Le Vrai semblance . MEGAN stands up , enraged . She belts him . MEGAN My friends and I have not ordered yet , and I find this behavior on your part extraordinarily quadruped . Not to mention Negroid and beyond the pale . Skid mump . Poleax the hyperborean tomato plant chop up the telephone cancer monster boredom and wretching dry heaves with a needle stitching all their hearts together on a clothesline beneath the oilous ombulations of the sea swollen beyond its border to eat . Melted DEBORAH The man is trying to speak , Megan . Two wrongs do n't make a right . Remember the golden rule . For Christ 's sake . p. 26 JOHN SLEIGHT ( Gets up from the floor . ) You 're right , Deborah . SECOND WAITER I am learning to take order by telepathic mysterium .

A weird light appears . MEGAN And what is it we need , my good man ? SECOND WAITER French wine . Eggs up the stream . Chicken smashed pot . Blight . Roasted plate . Bowel of lamb . Verbatim all around . MEGAN A genius ! SECOND WAITER Of a minor sort . He bows.I go now . Blackout .
