But of course we expect just these adaptations and magical transformations from our performers . It ' s the bag of tricks the lot of them were born to. // Lately I ' ve been impressed by the kinds of adaptation - and the sheer number of them - that the audience is required to make . Consider , for a moment , the case of " Pygmalion . " The entertainment at the Plymouth - and I assure you it is entertaining - is one of those who ' s-free-at-the-moment ? packages that London produces occasionally put together for West End consumption , hiring whatever top-notch players happen to be available for a few months and giving them what might very well be called a free hand with a good play. // I don ' t mean to say that the production is slapdash ; let ' s just call it undirected . Or say that it ' s been directed , each man for himself , a line at a time by whoever happens to have the line . The players in question at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mills , Joyce Redman and Dora Bryan , and the engagement here , like its London predecessor , is a limited one . In fact , the run has only a few weeks to go , as do you. // The audience with which I saw the show was not only enjoying itself , it seemed to be having some new kind of experience . The experience stemmed , I think , from two plain facts that didn ' t fit . The first was this : virtually every member of the acting company was working in a radically different performing style . And the second : Bernard Shaw ' s play was so relentlessly enchanting that it simply rose above the mismatched styles , embracing them and all but fusing them in its ample , imperious arms . Of course it didn ' t quite fuse them . That would probably have been impossible . But it did extend to the audience an invitation . The audience , with its participatory gifts , could make a deal . Supposing that these actors couldn ' t , or just plain wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out front could do it , in their heads - providing that the actors would go right on having such fun with their solo flights . Now that is a kind of crazy , eye-crossing deal . But for a circusy outing in the living theater it seemed to me cheerfully worth making. // What impressed me was the audience ' s quick skill at sorting everything out , giving every player ' s doodles the right response . It looked at Peter O ' Toole , a. k. a . Professor Higgins , and saw a great cockatoo arching its back on a handy piece of furniture that was not quite a perch . No doubt the playgoers expected him to caw at any moment . I think he did caw . And when he stopped preening himself and got down off his make-believe throne to flap loose among the living room ' s bric-a-brac , he was something of a blunderer , taking care to avoid damaging his mother ' s writing desk by crashing into a grandfather ' s clock instead . It is possible , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irons at the time . Likely because Mr. O ' Toole has the biggest feet I have ever seen on man or bird. // Coming back to rest , or home to roost , he proudly displayed a myna bird ' s passion for verbal thrills and spills . Half the time he sounded like a slot machine disgorging clanking silver coins to playgoers who felt they might have hit the jackpot . Another quarter of the time he chose to rock sideways - left-foot , right-foot - in the rollicking rhythm of Shaw ' s words , provided Shaw ' s words had been rewritten by Kipling . Less often , but frequently , he unleashed whole speeches like arrows into the air so that their fall to earth would coincide exactly with his last available breath . And there were a few times when he waxed quietly lyrical , especially when he was describing to Liza Doolittle the chocolates she would be allowed to feast on if she became an exemplary pupil. // Now , the audience not only had to weigh these matters and decide in what actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had to apply entirely different standards to each of the Doolittles , daughter Liza ( Amanda Plummer ) and father Alfred ( John Mills ) . As stylists , these two belong at opposite ends of the spectrum . Miss Plummer comes on with every ounce of intensity showing , even when she is standing still and quivering . She is a blaze that can ' t be put out , and if Mr. O ' Toole wants to give a performance that is all parlor tricks she is by God going to see that the scullery is kept clean . Her hair may be a mess , while she is still selling flowers in Covent Garden , and the fronds that drip from her forehead may seem like a threat of rain ; but her integrity is intact , and don ' t question it . She might bite. // Actually , Miss Plummer is not at her best in the opening scenes ; she can do Cockney but she must " do " it , it ' s nothing that comes naturally . Least of all the outbursts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Plummer must always take a beat to prepare herself , whereas it ' s essential that they come unself-consciously and unbidden . But from the time that this Liza appears , tidied-up rather more than usual , for her first phonetics lesson , it is clear that Mr. O ' Toole will not have to make her into a lady ; he will merely have to make her sound like the lady she instinctively is. // Will the comedy work in such an earnest , straightforward approach ? On the double , it would seem . From the tea-party scene , in which the rigorously trained Liza is " tried out " on a few of her betters , Miss Plummer doesn ' t miss a laugh . I was going to say " doesn ' t miss a trick , " inventive fellow that I am , but that ' s the whole point : it ' s not a trick , it ' s urgently for real - and all the funnier . I actually heard the audience doing something quite uncommon during the sequence . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then pulling that laugh up short so that it wouldn ' t miss the next . There ' s self-discipline for you . Not on the stage , out front. // As for John Mills , unfamiliar in our playhouses but much beloved for his films , there ' s yet another kind of sensibility to be dealt with . I suspect that Mr. Mills does not like acting by signals . That ' s to say , he doesn ' t come on with an emphatically established persona , recognizable at first wink , first strut , first set of the jaw . He comes on as an unknown complexity , a bundle of possibilities yet to be named. // Mr. Mills doesn ' t offer us a character that can be recognized on sight . It is necessary to listen to the man to get to know him . And so the actor carries us through the introductory niceties , through the state of the world and the state of the weather , and at last to the plausibly preposterous bargain that will allow Doolittle ' s daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but decent fee of 5 . Each of Doolittle ' s two scenes - people are always forgetting that there is a tasty second one - begins in civility and eventually flowers into a kind of insanely inverted common sense. // Mr. Mills threads his way to the big laughs patiently , knowing that the audience will find them without his having to point too much . Of course Mr. Mills ' s attack is as unlike Miss Plummer ' s as hers is unlike Mr. O ' Toole ' s . But I needn ' t illustrate the point until it works it way down to the ushers . What is interesting to me is that the audience has the flexibility to spot these unbalanced relationships and , instead of rejecting them outright , to weave them into an imagined pattern that will do for the evening - so long as the pleasure holds out . It knows that it must listen very carefully , very quietly to John Mills , because he works by evolution , letting one topsy-turvy thought grow logically out of another . To listen so closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow you clean from your seat and two rows back if you weren ' t properly braced for her . And Mr. O ' Toole may not want you to listen to him so much as look at him ; even his Dick Tracy mouth is used more for visual effect than for verbal elegance , volume to be adjusted as needed. // There are times when patience is profitable , times when a little tolerance can buy a lot of fun . This is one of them . Oddly , it ' s also the only " Pygmalion " I ' ve ever seen that has made one of the evening ' s ironies deliciously plain . It happens as we are about to meet Alfred Doolittle for a second time . When we first saw him , he was dressed in his working clothes , those of an exceedingly common dustman . Much later , and after Liza has had her thundering success as a mysterious duchess , the parlormaid announces a visitor . Henry Higgins is too busy to see anyone , but asks who it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do you mean the dustman ? " // " Dustman ! Oh , no , sir ; a gentleman. " // And suddenly , without anyone ' s having said it out loud , we recognize that class distinctions are even less meaningful than Higgins had thought them . The unspoken impiety echoes through a stunned silence on stage . What has been announced and not announced is this : All the while that Higgins was slaving to make a lady out of Liza , her dustman father was becoming a gentleman with no effort at all. // Mr. O ' Toole and parlormaid Selena Carey-Jones handle that bit of interplay , of quite silent give and take , extremely well. //
