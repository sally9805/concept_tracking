Jim Abbott delivers 90-mph fastballs not to turn doubters into admirers or the curious into the awestruck . His objective is simply to turn batters into outs . The sophomore southpaw , who has a 10-3 record for ninth-ranked Michigan , was born with just one hand . He says , no , he 's not discomforted ; no , he 's not courageous . He does n't even consider himself handicapped . " I 'm a pitcher working at it , " says the 19-year-old from Flint , Mich. , " and people write me letters calling me an inspiration . " Abbott has always counted his good fortune and never dwelled on his misfortune . " I 've been blessed with a pretty good left arm and a not-so-great right arm , " he says . // The right arm , it 's true , transforms Abbott from another college ace into a rather compelling story . The limb begins normally enough at the shoulder , but it ends just above where the wrist would be in a fleshy nubbin , from which protrude the barest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can applaud a good defensive play or tie his shoelaces , and when he sticks his nub into his jeans pocket he 's indistinct from the campus horde . " The only thing really missing is fingers , " Abbott says . // If the right arm is unusual for its appearance , the left is extraordinary for its performance . He led the Flint Central High intramural basketball league in scoring . He once heaved three TD passes for Central in the first half of a state playoff game . ( That fall he also averaged 37.5 yards as a punter . ) In his senior season he struck out two batters an inning and gave up fewer than two hits a game . And with his nub tucked in his left-hand grip , he batted .427 with a team-high seven homers and played left , first and an inning of short . " If I had n't grown up having to do everything with my left , I do n't know if it would have developed like this , " Abbott says . // As a Wolverine freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win that clinched the Big Ten title . This year the 6 ' 3 " 200-pounder has a 2.44 ERA for the 50-10 Wolverines , largely because he threw 35 straight innings without an earned run . Sunday , in the Big Ten tournament , he threw seven innings of six-hit ball to beat Purdue 5-2 and force a final game with the Boilermakers on Tuesday for the league title . Both teams have locked up NCAA playoff berths . // Earlier , in a 2-1 win over Indiana , Abbott dazzled a troop of major league scouts by pitching six one-hit innings . Ed Katalinas of the Tigers : " After the second inning , there 's no handicap . " Bob Gardner of the Angels : " What really amazes me is how he fields . He has the tools to pitch in the majors . " Steve Boros of the Padres : " Very impressive . Good stuff . Live fastball . Decent curve . Throws strikes . If he stays healthy , he 'll be a legitimate high draft choice . " // Making all this feasible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enables him to pitch with his left hand while balancing the inside of his glove on his nub . After a pitch , he slips his hand inside the glove . On a fielding play , he catches the ball , cradles the glove with his right arm , slips his left hand out and makes the throw . The process is so fluid and natural that many who have gone to a game expressly to see him throw have watched for several innings before realizing it was Abbott they had been watching all along . // Abbott would prefer those innings of unawareness to last forever . He takes the attention from the press in stride . " If the story helps out someone else with a problem , then it makes what I 'm doing all the more worthwhile , " he says . But when talk shifts from the left arm to the right , Abbot 's blue eyes dim a bit and his blond head bows . He 's not mad or annoyed , just once again reminded that he 's stuck with this starring role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , his boyhood idol was n't Pete Gray , the one-armed outfielder , or Monty Stratton , the one-legged pitcher . It was Rick Leach , the two-sport Wolverine star from Flint now with the Blue Jays . " I had to learn to do it with one hand because that 's all I had , " Abbott says . Consequently , he has followed the advice he gives to handicapped kids : " Do n't let it get you down . " Says his father , Mike , " Jim never talks negatively about himself or anyone . That 's just his nature . " // Mike and his wife , Kathy , were both 18 and barely out of high school when they had Jim . It was n't easy , but they got through college , and now Mike is a sales manager for a beer distributor , Kathy is an attorney for a firm specializing in education law , and they have one other son , Chad , 15. // Jim was fitted for a fiberglass prosthesis with clamping metal hooks at age five , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mike and Kathy hoped Jim would gravitate toward soccer , where his handicap would be inconsequential , but Jim loved baseball . He spent hours pitching imaginary games against the brick wall outside the family 's town house , moving closer and closer to his target , forcing himself to effect the hand-glove switch more and more quickly before the ball caromed back . He was n't working on a technique to wow the world ; he liked doing it , and it was what he had to do to play . " Jim has always been well adjusted , self-motivated  --  academically and in sports , " Kathy says . " After a while , what he did we took for granted . " // Abbott got his first start as an 11-year-old Little Leaguer for Lydia Simon Real Estate . He smoked a five-inning no-hitter , which was ended by the mercy rule . Word of his handiwork spread quickly through the press ( " We were amazed , " says Kathy ) , and encouragement was everywhere . " If someone had said , ' No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and keep score , ' I might have been crushed and never gone on , " Abbott says . // When he was a freshman at Central , eight straight hitters once bunted on him . " I do n't know if that was the situation with one hand , " Abbott says , " or because I 'd just struck out 10 of them . " After the first bunter reached first , he threw out the next seven . But even varsity baseball coach Bob Holec was a shade skeptical . During a freshman game Holec told Mike Abbott his son might have trouble fielding at the next level . As he spoke , Jim speared a one-hopper and started a double play . " Well , " said Mike , " I guess he can handle grounders back at him . " Holec became an ardent supporter and urged Jim to give football a shot as a junior . He needed several weeks to learn to control the snap , but Jim went on to quarterback the Indians to the state semis his senior year . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedy runner out at home on a 270-foot fly to left ; Abbott whacking a 330-foot game-winning homer to center ; and Abbott , after a poor outing in the opener of a double-header , pausing to talk quietly with a handicapped kid , then returning to win the nightcap in extra innings . His own three-run homer was the gamer. // Toronto drafted Abbott in the 36th round after his senior year of high school and offered him $50,000 to sign , but he elected to go to Michigan . His first victory as a Wolverine came against North Carolina last spring . A runner was on third with two out when Abbott entered in the bottom of the seventh inning . On the return throw after his third pitch , the runner broke for home while Abbott was switching . The peg beat him to the plate by 20 feet . " If they had done that on any of my other pitchers , they might have got away with it , " says Michigan coach Bud Middaugh . " But Jim 's much more aware . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead in the eighth and won 6-3. // " He fields better than I do , " says Michigan pitching star Mike Ignasiak . " His mechanics are unbelievable . " // Life 's not perfect for Abbott . Like most young lefthanders , he can be wild , and his curve has n't quite come around . Fish do n't like the way he baits his hook . He has n't yet settled on a major . But game accounts no longer call him the one-hand wonder , and he 's being appreciated more and more for his ability than for his disability . That 's the breakthrough he has always wanted . " When it comes down to it I 'll take my ability with anyone else 's , " Abbott says . " It 's not that big a factor in my life . "
