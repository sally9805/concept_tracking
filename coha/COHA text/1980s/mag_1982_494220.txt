The ground is not steady beneath the nuclear forces of the United States . The problem is not modes of basing but modes of thinking . The traditional strategy for our nuclear arsenal is shaken by a war of ideas about its purpose , perhaps the most decisive war of ideas in its history . The purpose of the arsenal , at least until now , has been deterrence . The classic formulation was by Bernard Brodie , who wrote in 1946 , " Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars . From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them . " Military planners and military intellectuals have been glossing Brodie 's dictum ever since . Now things seem to be changing . Deterrence is everywhere be ? sieged . In the Pentagon it is challenged by concepts of nuclear use . In the peace movement it is challenged by perfectibilian schemes for disarmament . The days may he gone when arguing for deterrence was like arguing for motherhood . Its merits are no longer obvious . Con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influential interventions of President Reagan 's speech of November 22 and of The Challenge of Peace : God 's Promise and Our Response , the pastoral letter on war and peace of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops . " What do we mean when we speak of nuclear deter ? rence ? " the President asked . Not " excessive forces , " he replied , " or what some people have called ' overkill . ' " The natural complement of deterrence , moreover , is arms control . They are , he said , " parallel paths the only paths that offer any real hope for an enduring peace . " And deterrence , he explained , is a policy of defense : " The United States will never use its forcesexcept in response to attack . " Sufficiency , not superior ? ity , in the quantity of nuclear weapons ; negotiations to control and reduce them ; the renunciation of any inten ? tion to employ them except in retaliation , exactly as the theory of deterrence mandates ? this is the sweet voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the policy of deterrence has stood the test of time , " the equivocation began , " the things we must do in order to maintain deterrence have changed . " There followed his now famous charts , the first national secu ? rity video game : blue for the United States ( the Presi ? dent 's thesis was that the United States has reason to be blue ) , and red for the Soviet Union ( color-coordinated , again ) ; and the chaste white background stood silently for the chaste planet earth , which the lethal lines on the graph are disfiguring . The charts showed , with a very selective marshaling of evidence , that the Russians are ahead . " In virtually every measure of military power the Soviet Union enjoys a decided advantage . " The conclu ? sion drawn from this demonstration was what the Presi ? dent called " modernization , " and " modernization " meant the MX . The MX is a missile that is seventy feet long , weighs ninety-six tons , and carries ten warheads , each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than thirty times that of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima . Each of these warheads may be independently targeted ; they are already accurate enough to hit very " hard " and very small targets , such as missile silos , with only a small " delivery error , " and the experts are confident that during the next decade the " error " will be virtually abolished . The Reagan Administration wants to develop and deploy one hundred of these things . ( There is some good news here : the Carter Administration had set its heart on two hundred . Of course Congress would not hear of such grandiosity ; still , it is heartening to see Ronald Reagan lower a number . ) They will be deployed in a manner known as " dense pack . " That is , all one hundred will be planted in a single field near Cheyenne , Wyoming , and will be defended from Soviet missiles by the Soviet missiles themselves , which will create a nu ? clear hurricane that will knock them off course . This is the effect known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the plan for the new missile , which will be called " Peacekeeper . " ( We defer , on this , to Johnny Carson , who said , " Soon they 'll rename napalm ' Crazy Foam . ' " ) The President 's justification for the program was the famous " window of vulnerability , " the exposed condition of the United States 's land-based missile force . The problem of ICBM vulnerability ? the President is correct that it exists ? is also the problem of ICBM sur ? vivability : the United States must be certain that enough of its icems will survive a Soviet strike to strike back . It is the capacity for a second strike that we are trying to secure ? the capacity , in other words , to fulfill the re ? quirements of deterrence . So goes the President 's ex ? planation . But a trick is being played on the American people . The problem of ICBM vulnerability has nothing to do with the kind of ICBM that is vulnerable . What deter ? mines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The MX would be exactly as unsafe as the Minuteman in the dispersed silos , and the Minuteman would be exactly as safe as the MX in the dense pack . Assuming , of course , that the dense pack works . We have already expressed our doubts about this ( " Window Pain , " TNR , October 18 ) , though we ca n't be sure that it wo n't work , and neither can the Russians . We can be sure , however , that " dense pack " will not work for very long . The Soviets can immobilize our entire MX force with what is called a " pindown " ? exploding a sufficient volume of warheads at an appropriate altitude above the " dense pack , " thus making it impossible for the marvel ? ous MX to get through . " Pindown " is mentioned no ? where in the White House 's background statements on the subject , unless that is what it means by " Soviet countermeasures " that are " no more than technical dreams . " But " pindown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians do not yet possess the precise megatonnage to pin us down , but even the Air Force general in charge of MX admits that it will " drive them to development of new warheads larger in yield . " According to Henry Jackson , the honest hawk , the Russians could have such warheads in four years . Up , then , goes the window . ( Enter ABM , stage right . ) Mr. Reagan 's analysis of our strategic situation epito ? mizes the mixture of patriotism and panic that may be found also in the present Pentagon . But neither the President nor the Pentagon has provided the answer to arather simple question : if the Russians can destroy our entire land-based missile force , why do n't they ? The answer is that they probably ca n't , because unless they did away with all our missiles , they would be punished for the attempt by those that remained ; and that even if they could , they wo n't , because we have missiles at sea and in the air which would avenge our ICBMs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . The deter ? rence scenario , after all , always envisaged something like the SS-18s ? that is , it envisaged a Russian first strike . The sincerity of that scenario is now being tested . Did we mean what we said about desiring only to deter ? If we did , we are still just as safe . If it is really a second strike for which we wish to prepare , we are prepared . The vulnerability of land-based missiles is not the same thing as the vulnerability of the United States . It is , however , a permanent fact of life ; and it endangers the Russians more than it does the United States , because three quarters of their Strategic Rocket Forces are land-based . Our ICBMS are vulnerable ; we are not . Indeed , as Lawrence Freedman has written , " the fact that ICBM vulnerability provided the greatest cause for concern in the early 1980s could be taken as a symptom of the underlying stability of the strategic balance . " THE MX , in other words , is not invulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second strike ; there exists the unjustly vilified Minuteman III for that . ( This weapon is not exactly a slingshot , as recent Administra ? tions would have us believe . Some of the Minuteman Ws are even good against Soviet missile silos ; they are , that is to say , counterforce weapons , which is their dirty little secret . ) From the point of view of deterrence , then , the MX is not justified . It is justified only from the point of view of counterforce . The MX is an improvement upon the Minuteman only if you have offense in mind . When the President declared that we will never strike first , and then went on to introduce the MX , he was deceiving the public , because the MX is supremely a first-strike weapon . The adoption of the MX by the American government represents not only the perfec ? tion of a technology but the transformation of a strategy . Does the United States need a first-strike weapon ? The Pentagon says yes , because the Russians have one . James Schlesinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call this " essential equivalence . " But , once again , if the Russians will fire their 5S-18s at our Laws , they will pay with a big part of Russia . Only if we wish to fire our ICBMs at their SS-18s ? that is , only if we wish to start a nuclear war ? do we need the MX . Our planners appear to believe that there are circumstances in which it would be in our interest to start a nuclear war . These conditions are usually referred to as " grave crises , " in which , according to one specialist , " resorting to inter ? continental nuclear attack would likely be the result of a conviction that a nuclear exchange had become inev ? itable , and that some advantage would obtain from going first . " What the advantage might be is unclear . If we go first , they will go second . Who cares who goes third ? Such brinksmanlike behavior , moreover , might also occur to the Russians . Indeed , once we have the MX , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is the best reason for preemption the Russians will ever have . Militarily , then , the MX is a mockery of deterrence , and makes the world a more dangerous place . Other justifications , however , are given for it . The fear of a Soviet breakthrough in antisubmarine warfare , for ex ? ample . It is argued that conceding the vulnerability of our land-based missile force to the Russians will enable them to concentrate all their resources upon research and development at sea . This is not terribly persuasive . The Soviet disadvantage at sea is staggering , and it will be many , many years before they catch up . The United States , moreover , is not exactly devoid of the power to make the Russians fear for their own lows . Their SS-17s , SS-18s , and SS-19s add up to about 820 counter-force targets , and three hundred of our Minuteman Ills are outfitted with three warheads each , which adds up to nine hundred counterforce weapons . Not a perfect counterforce capacity , to be sure ( military planners com ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so imperfect that the Russians can sleep soundly . The only argument for the MX that makes any sense is the argument from arms control ? such is the perversity of the nuclear world . There may be a tactical value in proposing it , and in beginning to build it . The MX will be the Soviets ' only incentive to reduce , limit , or dismantle their SS-18s , and it is the most urgent task of the United States in strategic arms talks to act upon the SS-18s . This makes the MX missiles the most expensive bargaining chips in history ? about $300 million a chip . ( The MX is the perfect counterbudget weapon . ) This is also expecting the Russians to cut into the best and largest part of their forces , which may be expecting too much . Still , if they are per ? suaded of the Ameri ? can intention to be ? come a first-strike superpower , they may make a deal . If they do , the sums spent in re ? searching and develop ? ing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridding the world of these disgust ing devices . We believe that the President is sincere when he maintains that he needs to take the MX to Geneva . Si vis pacern , para bellum , the old Roman adage sternly warns . If you want peace , prepare for war . But we have our doubts , however , that the planners in the Pentagon who invented and peddled this missile did so for the sake of arms control . They want us to have the MX , and maybe to use it . They think that it improves our political and military position . If you want war , prepare for war . So it is a gamble . If we win , a dimension of danger will disappear . If we lose , we will live forever by our nerves . When the National Conference of Catholic Bishops con ? vened in Washington recently , it was addressed by its president , Archbishop John R. Roach of St. Paul and Minneapolis . " The Catholic bishops of the United States , " the Archbishop began , " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that they are nevertheless quite consistent . Consider , he said , two of the issues that exercise them , " abortion and the Bomb . " " Concern for human life is the nexus between our positions on these two large issues .. . . We are also attempting to evaluate defense policies to determine whether their acceptance involves us as a nation in a moral stance which is pro-life or anti-life . " There it is . To he against deterrence is to be pro-life . Maybe the Arch ? bishop has a point . To be for deterrence is to be pro-choice . The bishops came to Washington to consider a new draft of a pastoral letter on national security policy that has been circulating among them since the summer . The letter is long , mostly serious , here lucid , there loopy . Its arguments are occasionally marred by modishness , as when it speaks of Jesus 's " nonviolent lifestyle . " It pur ? ports to embody a " theology of peace , " and when it departs from the strict moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " theology of peace " looks a little like an Americanization of the " liberation theology " of the last decade . It dwells at length , for example , on " the economics of disarmament . " The arms race is " an act of aggression against the poor , " " a massive distortion of resources in the face of crying human need . " The authors of the document are in ? trigued , on the other hand , by " the possibilities of conversion of defense industries to other purposes . " This evangelical zeal for conversion , of course , is not the bishops ' only ; the social and economic argument against defense spending is familiar enough . We appreciate its force . It is sad to spend so much on war , in a time of peace , and in a time of hardship . But we do not agree that the first criterion of defense spending is social or economic . It is military . If a weapon is shown to be necessary , it must he built . If it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic crime . THE THESIS of the pastoral letter is the moral defi- ciency of deterrence . " Nuclear Deterrence is Idola ? try , " thundered Archbishop Raymond Hun thausen , who is a unilateralist . The pastoral letter is not unilateralist , though it speaks sympathetically of paci ? fism . It grounds its criticism of deterrence , rather , in another " moral choice for the kingdom , " which it refers to as " the just war position . " The standards for a just war ? that is , of a war whose means are justified as well as its ends ? are " discrimination , " which " prohibits all actions directly intending to take the lives of civilians and noncombatants , " and " proportionality , " which constitutes an instant indictment of all nuclear use be ? cause of all the deaths that must ensue . On the basis of these standards the pastoral letter concludes : " 1 . Under no circumstances may nuclear weapons or other in ? stances of mass slaughter be used for the purpose of destroying population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not perceive any situation in which the deliberate initiation of nuclear warfare , on however restricted a scale , can be morally justi ? fied . Nonnuclear attacks by another state must be resis ? ted by other than nuclear means . " No first use , in other words , though thirty pages later the bishops make the rather puzzling remark that they do not want to " make the world safe for conventional war , " either . ( That was exactly Alexander Haig 's response to the idea of no first use . ) The bishops are admirable in the firmness with which they condemn all manner of nuclear war-fighting : " There should be a clear public resistance to the rhetoric of ' winnable ' nuclear wars , ' surviving ' nuclear ex ? changes , and strategies of ' protracted nuclear war . ' " Nodoubt this refers to the conceptions of Caspar Weinber ? ger 's " Defense Guidance , " America 's plan for the wag ? ing of a nuclear war , which was leaked to The New York Times last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they do n't stop there . They proceed to the very structure of deterrence . Their objective is to discredit the second strike . " Retaliatory action which would take many wholly innocent lives ... must also be con ? demned . Our condemnation applies to the retaliatory use of weapons striking cities after our own have already been struck . " And not only is the second strike immoral , so too is the threat of the second strike . As Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia put it in his testimony on behalf of SALT it in 1979 ( which was a significant development in the politicization of the Catholic clergy ) : " Not only the use of strategic nuclear weapons , but also the declared intent to use them involved in our deterrence policy , are both wrong . " It is hard to see what is precisely Catholic about these objections , what is their relation to Augustine or Aqui ? nas . Indeed , these objections against the morality of deterrence are made so often that they are banal . The nuclear debate of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Kennan , E.P . Thompson , and Jonathan Schell have all written at length on its ethical inadmissability . So , too , have Fred IkI6 , at present Undersecretary of Defense , and other prominent nuclear war-fighters ; the attempt to limit the indiscriminate effects of nuclear weapons , and thereby make them usable , is defended as an attempt to make nuclear weapons more moral . ( Secretary of the Navy John Lehman made this point in a reply to the bishops in The Wall Street Journal . ) The pastoral letter , in other words , does not exist in an intellectual vacuum . It exists , rather , in an intellectual climate in which deterrence is frequently degraded . WHAT WOULD the bishops put in its place ? They re for the freeze , but deterrence will still be the purpose of the arsenals that are frozen . They are for what they call " first steps , " that is , " some independent initiatives , beyond those already taken , to reduce some of the gravest dangers and to encourage a constructive Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , but deterrence will be necessary after the " first steps " have been made . And they are for arms control . But there is no scheme for arms control presently under public discussion , from Ronald Reagan 's to George Ken ? nan 's , that will not need deterrence for what remains . Nobody is going to zero ; going to zero , in fact , may be our age 's refinement of the vision of Isaiah . After all the attacks on deterrence have been made , after its wickedness has been expounded upon for mil ? lions of Catholics ( and for the entire nation , for it is " the nation 's soul " to which the bishops wish to minister ) , after the controlling notion of our entire system of national security has been raked over by the highest ecclesiastical authorities , the bishops have an after thought . It is that deterrence is the best thing we have . Citing John Paul II , they concede that all their objections apply only to deterrence as " an end in itself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is pursued in con ? junction with arms control . ( " Parallel paths , " as Presi ? dent Reagan put it . ) But who is for " deterrence in itself , " and what does it mean ? Of course deterrence and arms control must go together . The bishops ' final word on the matter is this : " As clearly unsatisfactory as the deterrent posture is from a moral point of view , use of nuclear weapons by any of the nuclear powers would be an even greater evil . " We agree , but we are troubled . The pastoral letter on war and peace presses most heavily upon deterrence . Its consequence will be the slackening of the only responsi ? ble attitude toward nuclear weapons that has so far been conceived . This is , of course , a political objection to the bishops ' document , but they can not have it both ways . They stand upon their right to come into politics , but they can not , when confronted with the real political effects of their efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unilateralism , or nuclear war-fighting . In the present situation , then , there are few greater sins against sanity than the weaken ? ing of deterrence . Like the President , the bishops have sinned. q THE P.L.O . ' S CENTRAL . COUNCIL met in Damascus and finally gave its answer to the Reagan plan . The answer is no . Those in the West who sympathize with the P.L.O . fervently wished it would give a hint of a willingness to recognize Israel . They were disappointed , again . We are neither disappointed nor surprised . As Henry Kissinger has recently pointed out , " in negotiations between Israel and the Arabs , the question of recognition plays a disproportionate and unprecedented role . In all other negotiations mutual recognition is assumed at the out ? set . I know no other negotiation in which a country is asked to accept recognition of its existence as the princi ? pal quid pro quo . " And recognition , he points out , " is not , when all is said , much of a concession for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up being destroyed even in our own time . " q ' OPTION PAPERS ' do n't tell very much about policy , but they do tell a lot about the mentality of the people who make policy . On Thanksgiving Day , the mentality of the President 's economic policymakers was unmasked in an " option paper " presented to him about unemployment . Among the options was a tax on unemployment bene ? fits . Of course there is a kind of grotesque logic to this . The Administration is desperate about its deficit . It must put a tax on something . Why not , therefore , put a tax on what it produces in greatest quantity ? unemployment ? The avowed aim of the " option " was to make unem ? employment " less attractive , " spoke White House spokes ? man Larry Speakes . This is of a piece with the Reagan ? omical concept of " incentives " : to make the rich work , provide money ; to make the poor work , take it away . " We do know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits end , most people find jobs very quickly . ... " Not anymore , Mr. Meese . More than half of the nearly twelve million people out of work collect no benefits . They are flat broke . They do not believe that unemployment is " attractive . " They believe that it is terrible . It damages their souls and leaves their families destitute . And now the Administration adds its insult to its injury . q THE EXTENT OF HOLLYWOOD 'S interference with life was recently suggested by the alacrity with which the studios made themelves available to John DeLorean . And now Elizabeth Taylor , for decades Hollywood 's ambassadress to the world , and perhaps its most con ? summate creation , nakedly expresses the industry 's most profound feeling about a human life ? in a word , that it is a property . She is suing ABC to prevent it from making a " docu-drama " about her . " Miss Taylor 's first contention , " according to The New York Times , " is that her life story is a commercial property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , as she herself put it , " I am my own commodity . " That must be one of the most alienated sentences ever uttered by man or woman . It is a kind of epitaph , and not only her own . And it suggests a more precise term for the condition of self-absorption in which movie stars are frequently found ; it is not vanity , it is commodity fetishism. blanca , Humphrey Bogart 's humanitarian killer , who was disillusioned apparently at his mother 's breast , has to say some silly things and to play God too often to be as believably tough as he was in his last eight pictures . Yet the people in Hollywood do n't project their hokum without reason . They know very well the pleasure one gets from seeing Ingrid Bergman , so noble and utterly clear , Mr. Bogart 's mouth , which seems to be holding back a mouthful of blood , the contrast in villains of Veidt , Greenstreet and Lorre . If , as this is , it is from Warner 's , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album of jazz classics , with a Negro ( Dooley Wilson ) singing them . Finally , there is one good se ? quence where intuitive feelings prevailed over script writers ' unconcern and Director Cruze 's incapable scis ? sors ? the scene in which the fighting Frenchmen drown out the Germans ' ' Horst Wessel ' by singing their ' Mar ? seillaise . ' Casablanca is as ineffectual as a Collier 's short story , but with one thing and another ? like Bergman , Veidt and Humphrey Bogart ? it is a pleasure of sorts .
