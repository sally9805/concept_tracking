The recommendations were made by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy , a 16-member advisory panel , which delivered its final report today to the President and Congress. // The Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh , president of the University of Notre Dame and chairman of the commission , said in his introduction that " we recommend closing the back door to undocumented/illegal migration " while " opening the front door a little more to accommodate legal migration in the interests of this country. " // The commission was created by Congress in 1978 to provide a comprehensive review of a field frequently said to be <> <> Excerpts from report , page B5. <> dominated by confused , conflicting policies and archaic laws . In its 453-page final report , the panel said that the overall goals of immigration policy should be " family reunification , economic growth consistent with protection of the United States labor market and cultural diversity consistent with national unity. " // // Amnesty Tied to Improvements // The commission said that its proposal for legalizing the status of illegal aliens was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the border and inside the United States . Without such improvements , it said , the amnesty " could serve as a stimulus to further illegal entry. " // Reagan Administration officials had no immediate comment on the report . The executive director of the commission , Dr. Lawrence H. Fuchs , said the White House had indicated that President Reagan would not participate in a formal presentation ceremony that was tentatively scheduled for tomorrow. // Four Cabinet officers from the Carter Administration served on the commission , a bipartisan group that also included eight members of Congress and four private citizens appointed by President Carter. // Many of the commission ' s proposals , including those for additional enforcement , would cost money , perhaps substantial sums , that were not estimated in the report and that might be difficult to find at a time when Mr. Reagan is cutting the budgets of most civilian agencies . Even the Carter Administration , in its final budget proposals , suggested some cutbacks for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. // The commission said it did not rule out the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which about 30 , 000 aliens enter the United States each year as temporary workers . In the Presidential campaign last year , Mr. Reagan expressed support for a " guest worker " program under which millions of Mexicans could cross the border to accept jobs for several months at a time . <> <> Report Hailed by Kennedy // Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , who served on the commission , said that its report represented " the most significant and thoughtful study of American immigration law in three decades . " That assessment was shared by many specialists in the field , although hardly anyone agreed with all the panel ' s recommendations. // The commission suggested raising the ceiling on " numerically limited " immigration to 350 , 000 a year , from the current 270 , 000 . The commission would allow 100 , 000 more visas in this category for each of the next five years to clear the backlog of visa applications . These figures do not include either refugees or the estimated 150 , 000 aliens who would have automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens. // Assuming a normal annual flow of 50 , 000 refugees , the commission said that under its program there would be 650 , 000 people admitted legally as new entrants in each of the next five years , as against an average of 580 , 000 a year for the last five years . <> <> ' Mass Asylum Emergencies ' // The commission assumed that there would not be a repetition of the sudden , unexpected migration that brought 125 , 000 Cubans here last year . It did not say precisely how it would stop such an exodus in the future . But it did say that Federal agencies should work together in planning for such " mass asylum emergencies. " // The commission said it had concluded that a " modest increase " in legal immigration would advance the interests of the United States without harming domestic workers . To allow flexibility in the admission of refugees and immediate relatives , the commission said there should be " no total cap or ceiling " on the total number of immigrants. // The panel repeatedly expressed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic growth and cultural enrichment , stating that 30 percent of the United States ' Nobel laureates were immigrants . The commission said that " some immigrants do compete with United States workers for jobs , particularly in times of high unemployment , " but this was a secondary theme of the report. // In a study for the commission , the Census Bureau estimated that there were 3. 5 million to six million illegal aliens in the United States . The number who might come forward to take advantage of the proposed amnesty would probably depend on conditions to be specified by Congress , such as a requirement for continuous residence in the United States for a certain period . Dr. Fuchs said that one million to four million illegal aliens might come forward , but he acknowledged that in other countries " amnesties have been notoriously unsuccessful . " <> <> Ending Legal Inconsistency // The commission saw an anomaly in the fact that , under current law , illegal aliens could be arrested and deported but the employers who knowingly hired them could not be punished , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To end this inconsistency , the commission said that employers hiring undocumented workers should be subject to civil and criminal penalties such as administrative citations , fines and court injunctions. // By a vote of 8 to 7 , with one abstention , the commission said that penalties against employer should be coupled with " some system of more secure identification . " The panel , however , did not say whether the system should use a " counterfeit-resistant " Social Security card or a computer that employers could call , in the same way retailers now verify a person ' s credit card number. // Commissioners who opposed a new , more secure means of identification said that it could be abused by Government agencies and posed a potential threat to civil liberties. //
