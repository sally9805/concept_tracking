U.S. Envoy Habib struggles to defuse the missile crisis <P> The threat and the danger were still there . Syrian SA-6 missiles last week streaked into the sky over the Bekaa Valley to down at least one Israeli reconnaissance drone . Israel and Syria remained at loggerheads over the deployment of the Soviet-made missiles , and there was always the grave risk that one side or the other could miscalculate and ignite the region in conflict . But for the first time since the confrontation began , there was cautious optimism in both Jerusalem and Damascus that U.S. Special Envoy Philip Habib , 61 , might succeed , through his patient , peripatetic diplomatic shuttle , in fashioning a resolution to the crisis-a mission that was given virtually no chance of success when he undertook it three weeks ago . <P> The first glimmer that Habib 's talkathon might be paying off came early in the week , when Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin made the surprising announcement that his Cabinet had unanimously voted " to put no time limit whatsoever " on Habib 's efforts to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis , Begin had darkly hinted that Secretary of State Alexander Haig 's envoy had only a week to work his magic , or Israel would attack the missiles . Two days after the Cabinet meeting , in what seemed to be a reassuring signal to Syria 's President Hafez Assad , Begin spoke before a gathering of war veterans and flatly declared that Israel would not be the first to use force . Said an Israeli diplomat : " I would say that the chance of war now is almost nothing . " <P> As he went about his duties , the Lebanese American , whose patient , stubborn diplomacy appeared to be the last best hope for peace in the area , was as tight-lipped as ever about his mission . " I know you guys have to make a living too , " he told reporters , " but this is a serious effort that in no way would be served by public comment .

" <P> After three tense and exhausting weeks on the diplomatic trail , Habib could already be credited with helping to forestall an Israeli air raid on the missile sites . But the future joustings of bitter Middle Eastern rivalries remained uncertain , even if the immediate crisis could be resolved . Said a Western diplomat : " I hate to think that he might have to live like this for a couple of years . " <P> Increasingly it appeared that the key to a solution of the present threat might lie with Saudi Arabia , where Habib had spent two days in talks with Crown Prince Fahd and other Saudi officials . The Saudis deeply fear that if a Syrian-Israeli confrontation were to take place , the Soviets would strengthen their influence in the region . Damascus and Moscow signed a 20-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation last October . In the Saudi view , a military conflict might also foster radical politics in the area , posing yet another threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
