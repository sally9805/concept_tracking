This first weekend of the baseball season is unusual as far as television is concerned . It is the only Saturday for the next 26 weeks that the Red Sox will not be on Ch. 38 , and only one of 11 Saturdays that a national telecast will be on Ch. 4 . Just as last season , Boston ' s NBC affiliate will carry Saturday baseball only when that starting time and that of the Sox telecast on Ch. 38 are at least two hours apart . With the Sox idle today , the Rangers-Yankees will be on Ch. 4 at 2:45 p.m. , 15 minutes after the pregame show . There will be no baseball on Ch. 10 , the NBC affiliate in Providence . That station will follow its policy of last year and carry no games . Both NBC stations can cite past competition from Red Sox games on TV in trying to explain the baseball fadeout . While 200,000 homes tuned in to Red Sox Saturday telecasts on Ch. 38 last season , only 40,000 turned to the infrequent games on Ch. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever under the policy because NBC apparently will send as many Yankee games as possible into New England on the premise that there is more interest . For example , the Pirates-Astros game is the national telecast next Saturday , but the Yankees-Rangers game , which ordinarily would go only into Pittsburgh and Houston , will be sent into New England . But Ch. 4 will black out baseball next Saturday and continue to do so until May 30 . By that time the baseball strike threatened for May 29 could be under way . Would that be good or bad news to NBC ' s Boston and Providence affiliates ? The confusion at CBS over its delayed coverage of the NBA playoffs is emphasized by changes being made even as the various series progress . The Celtics-Bulls game last night , originally listed for a 9 p.m. tapoff in Chicago ( 10 p.m. here ) in order to reduce the network ' s tape-delay gap , was moved up a half-hour at the Bulls ' request on behalf of public safety . Now a fifth game , scheduled for Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from 9 to 8:30 p.m. and finally back to the regular starting time of 7:35 p.m . If CBS does cover the game , it still will be delayed on TV until 11:30 p.m. around the nation , four hours after the actual tapoff . However , a network official says that if a fifth game is played and has the potential to close out the series ( that is , if Boston would be leading , 3 games to 1 ) , the affiliates in the markets of the two teams involved , namely , Ch. 7 here and the CBS station in Chicago , will have their chances improved in picking up the games live . How much of an improvement remains vague . This policy leaves Ch. 7 even more vulnerable to the fans ' wrath because , going into last night ' s game , the station did not know - and would not know until after tomorrow ' s game - whether a fifth game would even be necessary , let alone decisive . Even then , it must wait another day to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ch. 4 will pick it up . Meanwhile , after a late tapoff ( 8:30 p.m. , Chicago time ) for last night , ticketholders to the Bulls-Celtics game tomorrow in Chicago face a noon start in deference to CBS , which wants a 1 p.m. start in the East in order to meld into the coverage of the Masters at 3:30 p.m . CBS ' firmness against allowing pro basketball to be seen in prime time is underscored by the rating for the last game seen during those hours . The Bullets-SuperSonics title game two years ago scored a 10.7 rating , about half the audience for the network ' s usual enterainment programming . One reason the NBA on CBS fares so badly is that many markets will not carry any or some of the playoff games . Among those spurning late-night coverage are five markets with NBA franchises - Detroit , Cleveland , Atlanta , Houston and Kansas City . The latter two now are picking up any coverage involving their teams , which have advanced to the quarterfinals after scoring upsets in the miniseries . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost totally to the Masters people , who in turn do not look kindly upon other sports telecasts cutting into their time . If basketball is still being played at 3:30 tomorrow , there is no guarantee that the network will not tell the NBA to drop dead in most markets and swing directly to the reverent happenings in Augusta . NBC ' s pregame baseball show this afternoon ( Ch. 4 , 2:30 p.m. ) will include details about the baseball owners ' huge strike insurance kitty that makes the likelihood of a strong stand against the players next month more probable . . . CBS will unveil its much planned Sports Saturday program today at 3 p.m. with Brent Musburger as host on a new set . A 10-rounder between heavyweights Greg Page and Marty Monroe will highlight the 60-minute show , filled out by features and scores from around the nation . Musburger will make a cameo appearance with the national Sports Sunday show tomorrow by introducing the NBA coverage and then will close out the Masters at 6 p.m. , as he will do for every CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable system , continues to grow in number of subscribers ( 9 million ) and programming , delivering the St. Louis- Pittsburgh NHL playoff game live tonight , and , if there is a fourth game , again tomorrow night . Last night , ESPN offered a 90-minute discussion on baseball that placed columnists Red Smith and Dick Young on the same panel , no small feat in itself . . . There is no conflict on Ch. 38 with Red Sox coverage through the Bruins ' series with Minnesota and their potential quarterfinal series to follow on the station . If the Bruins reach the semifinals and a conflict then arises , hockey will prevail . . . CBS flew Jamaal Wilkes to Phoenix for the Suns-Kings opener so Bill Russell could probe him at halftime on what had gone wrong for the Lakers in the Houston series . But Russell blew his assignment by merely consoling Wilkes . . . While attention has been focused on the three head-to- head nightly radio talk shows , WRKO ' s unopposed four-hour show with Glen Ordway as host got off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
