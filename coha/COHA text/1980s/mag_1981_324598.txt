At Begin , Dayan and others <P> Few figures in Menachem Begin 's Likud coalition have been as colorful as Ezer Weizman , 56 , a onetime British Royal Air Force pilot who served for three years as Begin ' s Defense Minister . He noisily resigned last May in a dispute over defense spending and the future of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . Last week Israeli readers pored over selected controversial passages from Weizman 's soon-to-be-published book , The Battle for Peace , a salty , 395-page memoir of the period straddling the 1978 Camp David accords . Excerpts : <P> On Begin : He invests words with magical properties . Begin is absolutely convinced that he holds the truth in his back pocket . Consequently , in addressing others-including the heads of great nations-he adopts the manner of a teacher talking to his pupils . There is something overbearing about his manner , and I suspect it has infuriated certain key figures in Washington , Cairo and elsewhere . <P> No sooner had the Camp David treaty been signed than Begin gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time he began to treat this peace we had struggled for as something banal , almost despicable . <P> On Moshe Dayan : I admire his individualism . He displays the wiles of a peasant and the deep roots of the sabra . Dayan can be compared to a demolition charge designed to bring down the wall of a house : placed incorrectly , it is capable of collapsing the whole structure . <P> On General Ariel Sharon , Begin 's Agriculture Minister : He is a great strategist ; he may be the greatest combat commander of our time . In war , I 'd follow him through fire and flood . But political life has different values . Sharon has lost sight of the distinction between his own personal good and the good of the state . This human bulldozer is capable of crushing whatever lies in his path . <P> On President Jimmy Carter : As far as I know , no American President has ever helped Israel as much as Jimmy Carter . I can not claim that Israel has responded with appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed that Miss Lillian wore a Jewish medallion . <P> " Where did you get this ? " I asked . <P> " From a Jewish rabbi in Miami . " <P> Her son added : " You see , the American Jewish community treats my mother far better than me. "
