Tomorrow South Koreans will try - once again - to pass that hurdle . If they succeed , it will be for the first time in their history. // Since the Republic of Korea was established in 1948 , power has been relinquished only by force . In 1960 , and again in 1980 , fledgling attempts at establishing democratic government were foiled by military takeovers. // // The generals who have ruled Korea since 1961 have brought wanted stability and remarkable economic progress . They have even allowed limited political freedom in civilianized administrations . But military leaders have not satisfied the desire for full democracy. // This election is a product of the Korean people ' s own insistence that their political life achieve the maturity of their economic modernization . When the military-backed government of President Chun Doo Hwan attempted to bring about a transition by means of indirect elections that effectively denied democratic choice , the people revolted. // The weeks of street protests last summer electrified not only the nation but the world . And the dramatic concessions to constitutional revision and direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But the bitter election campaign that has followed raises fears , never far from the surface , that the institutionalization of democracy is far from assured. // The campaign has been marked by political factionalism , intense regional rivalry , and violent disruptions of candidates ' electioneering. // The divide between the opposition and the ruling party is no surprise . But it has been accompanied by an increasingly hostile contest between the two leading opposition figures , Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung. // What will determine the voting of the Korean people ? These are the five main factors : // Regionalism - All four major candidates have bases in distinct regions . The regional rivalry is strongest between the poorer southwest area of Cholla and the more developed southeast Kyongsong region , where economic and political power has been concentrated. // Military vs. civilian rule - The simple issue of removing Army men from their positions of power throughout the government and economic system is paramount. // Class division - Labor unrest has risen , sharpening the line between the middle class and Korean workers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generation gap - Polling shows the younger generation is clearly in the opposition while those over 50 favor the present government. // The power of government - Many Koreans will respond to the influence of the government officialdom , which penetrates down to the household level. // The close three-way contest between the ' ' two Kims ' ' and ruling party leader Roh Tae Woo ( with a fourth major candidate , Kim Jong Pil , far behind ) has made the outcome highly unpredictable. // There is little disagreement that if the two Kims had united on a single opposition candidacy , they would easily win the election . With the opposition vote divided between two candidates , the victor will almost certainly gain only a plurality , perhaps as low as a third of the vote. // The victor will face the immediate difficulty of establishing legitimacy and of reassuring the supporters of his opponents that he will represent them as well. // This task will be most difficult in the event of a victory for Mr. Roh , and to a lesser extent for Kim Dae Jung. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition followers who already charge the government with preparing fraud , something that has occurred frequently in the past in Korea . Korean analysts expect the streets to be filled with student protesters , and others , and the country returned to even worse turmoil than last summer. // Kim Dae Jung , on the other hand , is widely viewed as the most radical of the major candidates . In military circles , Mr. Kim is often referred to as ' ' pro-communist . ' ' The military , it is said , will ' ' veto ' ' a Kim victory , especially one with minority backing. // The ' ' safe ' ' course , many believe , is a Kim Young Sam victory . Mr. Kim ' s moderate pragmatism offers both change and stability , reassuring to Korea ' s growing middle class. // The victory would have to be accepted by Kim Dae Jung ' s fervent supporters and by many of Roh ' s backers , especially if Kim offers a conciliatory hand to the military soon after the vote. // The most pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention . Still , it is difficult to foresee circumstances under which military rule would have legitimacy for the vast majority of Koreans. // More optimistically , the election might produce a clear victor , one widely accepted . At the least , the Korean people are likely to see that the exercise of democratic rights , even if accompanied by difficulties , is compatible with stability and continued economic progress . <> <> The major contenders and where they stand <> <> Kim Young Sam , Reunification Democratic Party // Kim Young Sam is a veteran opposition politician known for his moderate pragmatism . He was educated at the elite Seoul National University . A Presbyterian elder , Mr. Kim became South Korea ' s youngest legislator when he won a National Assembly seat in 1954 at the age of 24 . He contested Kim Dae Jung for the opposition party presidential nomination in 1971 , part of a long rivalry. // Kim has been detained numerous times for opposition to the military-backed regimes of Park and Chun Doo Hwan . In 1974 , he was president of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . In 1979 , he was expelled from the National Assembly , spurring revolts against the government . Following the military takeover in 1980 , Kim was barred from political activity though still managing to lead the main opposition. // Kim shares Kim Dae Jung ' s long history of struggle for political and human rights but not his radical image . He is viewed as a less doctrinaire politician , willing to compromise . His campaign has attracted the backing of senior retired military figures opposed to the current government. // Kim ' s image has strengthened his appeal to those of Korea ' s growing middle class who want an end to military role in politics but also seek stability to continue economic growth . Kim ' s middle-class base also includes strength among the large Protestant population . He should do well , probably ahead of all others , in the capital of Seoul. // Kim ' s strongest base , as with the other candidates , his home region ( for him , Kyongsong , particularly South Kyongsong ) . This province includes the industrial port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other major industrial centers. // Kim Jong Pil , New Democratic Republican Party Politician Kim Jong Pil is considered the spoiler among the major candidates . Though the former prime minister has no chance of victory , he commands a solid 5 to 10 percent of the vote , most of which would otherwise go to the ruling party. // Mr. Kim is the inheritor of the political machine created by the late President Park Chung Hee . Kim was an architect of the ' ' May Revolution ' ' of 1961 , the takeover by Park and a group of young nationalist Army officers . He was the first director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. // Kim was a key figure in the economic development policies of the Park era , which transformed South Korea from a poor , agricultural nation into a modern industrialized economy and major trading power . He promises to continue those policies. // Kim has a reputation as Korea ' s most able and intelligent politician . He appeals to some conservative elements of Korea ' s middle class . His main base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Chunchon , particularly in the major city of Taejon. // Kim Dae Jung , Party for Peace and Democracy // Kim Dae Jung is South Korea ' s most charismatic opposition leader , active in politics since 1948. // In 1971 , Mr. Kim ran against former Gen. Park Chung Hee as the opposition candidate in Korea ' s last direct elections for president , gaining 46 percent of the vote , despite evidence of fraud on Park ' s part . In 1973 , Kim was kidnapped by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency ( KCIA ) while in exile in Tokyo and spent much of the 1970s in and out of jail . Kim was arrested and sentenced to death for allegedly fomenting a May 1980 rebellion in Kwangju that was brutally crushed by the military. // Because of United States pressure , Kim was allowed to go into exile in the US in 1983 . He returned to Korea in 1985 , spending most of the time under house arrest until this past summer. // Kim is a devout Roman Catholic , espousing liberal democracy , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , however , he has a reputation as a radical , feared by the military and many middle-class voters . Although he has tried to moderate that image , his appeal is still greatest with the dissident movement , including human-rights activists , and with students , organized labor , and lower-income voters. // Kim ' s strongest support is in North and South Cholla , his home region . He will probably receive 80 to 90 percent of the Cholla vote . He is expected to do well in Seoul and Kyonggi Province. // Roh Tae Woo , Democratic Justice Party // Roh Tae Woo is the handpicked successor of President Chun . The two men were classmates at the Korea Military Academy , graduating in 1955 and rising together through the ranks. // On Dec. 12 , 1979 , General Roh , 9th Division commander , backed General Chun in seizing control of the military after the assassination in October of President Park by the head of the KCIA . In May 1980 , Roh commanded the capital garrison when Chun seized full power. // Following Chun ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military and served in several Cabinet positions . In June , Roh became the ruling-party candidate to succeed Chun after a decision to abort constitutional reform talks with the opposition . After weeks of mass protest , Roh made a historic speech on June 29 , conceding major reforms , including direct presidential elections. // Since then , Roh has worked hard to dissociate himself from the widely unpopular Chun . He has promised continued democratization and economic reforms , while emphasizing stability. // The ruling party has traditional strength among certain groups of voters . The farming population , 20 percent of the total populace , is the base of the ruling party . In urban areas , Roh has strength among conservative middle-class voters and less-educated , low-income workers. // Roh personally has a regional base in North Kyongsong Province , where the major city of Taegu , his hometown , is situated . Presidents Chun and Park are also from Taegu . In addition , Roh is expected to dominate the relatively sparsely populated province of Kangwon , which borders North Korea and is strongly anticommunist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Two other candidates are in the race : Kim Son Jok , Ilche ( United ) Democratic Party and Shin Jeong Yil , Hanist Unification Korea Party . Hong Sook Ja , the female candidate of the Social Democratic Party , withdrew in support of Kim Young Sam . Paek Ki Won , a prominent antigovernment dissident running as an independent , also pulled out . Mr. Paek had a strong radical student following. // Passing the reins : it ' s rarely gentle <> <> May 1948 - Elections for National Assembly held in South under UN supervision. // July 1948 - Syngman Rhee elected President by National Assembly. // August 1948 - Republic of Korea formally established in South. // August 1950 - After losses in Assembly election , Rhee declares martial law and alters Constitution to elect president by direct vote. // 1952 , 1956 - Rhee reelected. // 1960 - Rhee reelected with widespread fraud .
