Massachusetts received $1.9 billion from the federal government - almost 30 percent of the state ' s total revenue - in fiscal year 1980 . This is the sixth and final in a series of articles about where some of those federaldollars go , the impact they have on people ' s lives and the possible effects of proposed cutbacks in federal aid . Every time Marilyn gets in the checkout line at the food warehouse where she shops once a month , she suffers the same pangs . " I ' m so embarrassed , " she says . " I ' m almost afraid to look at the person next to me . I ' m afraid they ' ll think I ' m abusing the system . " Marilyn , who asked that her last name not be used , gets $69 a month in food stamps , which she uses to help feed herself and her two children . She also gets $l20 every two weeks in Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) and makes $90 a week at a part-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from college , which she was able to attend through a combination of AFDC and government grants , and hopes to get a full-time job soon . Neither Marilyn , the courts , nor the state Welfare Department have been able to prevail on her former husband to pay child support . " I hate using them , " she says of the stamps . " As soon as I get a full-time job , I ' ll be glad to get rid of them . " Marilyn knows about the food stamp scandals , about the stories of stamps being used to buy alcohol or drugs or fancy , gourmet foods . But she has trouble stretching the stamps to buy the macaroni and cheese and chicken and enriched spaghetti that she relies on to get through to the month . There are 153,000 households in Massachusetts receiving food stamps totaling $177.6 million in value . Some 93,000 of these households also get AFDC . The amount of stamps varies according to income and family size . The maximum gross income for a family of four eligible to receive food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level to $11,000 , eliminating an estimated 400,000 persons nationally . State administrators do not yet know how many persons in Massachusetts would be affected . A family ' s food stamp allotment is figured by taking the total monthly income and then making a series of standard deductions , such as $85 for medical costs , not more than $ll5 for child care and housing costs above a certain percent of income and 20 percent of earned income . The resulting net income is used to calculate the amount of stamps . For instance , a family of four with no other income would get $233 a month in food stamps . If the adjusted income were $300 a month , the food stamp allotment would be $l43 ; if monthly income were $6l9 , the allotment would be $47 a month . Nationally , there are 22 million persons receiving food stamps . Theaverage monthly gross household income for recipients is $320 , or $3840 a year , and the average monthly benefit is $35 per person or 38 cents per meal . Most of the elderly poor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in their monthly Supplemental Security Income checks . The food stamp program has been a frequent target of criticism . Allegations of fraud and abuse have been made to grand juries and before congressional committees . A federal audit of the Massachusetts system in l977 found a 71 percent " error rate , " including everything from ineligible recipients to signatures in the wrong place on application forms . A US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) official called the Massachusetts program at that time " the worst of any other state . " After the USDA withheld nearly $2 million in administrative funds , the state added more staff and reduced the error rate to a current figure of 12.8 percent ( The national error rate is 12.6 percent ) . Since l977 , according to the USDA , eligibility rules have been tightened nationally and the number of recipients has been reduced by 6 million . Among the reforms : Income limits for a family of four after deductions were loweredfrom $8200 to $7450 ; most college students dropped from the program ; luxury car owners dropped ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the elderly ; and the number of records an applicant must supply to prove eligibility was increased . An applicant now must produce a maximum of l4 documents including pay stubs , rent receipts , utility bills and Social Security numbers for all household members . Once a household has been found eligible , the head receives an Authorization to Purchase Card and monthly vouchers which can be taken to participating banks , discount stores and drugstores and exchanged for books of food stamps . If the stamps are detached from the books , grocery stores are not supposed to accept them . If the amount of a purchase is less than the face value of the food stamp coupon , the customer gets the change in stamps , unless it is less than one dollar . Food stamps can not be used for paper products , soap , beer , cigarettes , liquor or pet food . For those who rely on stamps for all or part of their food budgets , escalating grocery prices have made trips to the market an increasingly frustrating experience . Peanut butter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now costs almost as much as sirloin and fresh fruits and vegetables are almost out of reach . Unlike Marilyn , who has a car left over from her former marriage , most food stamp recipients do not have transportation to suburban food warehouses where prices are lower . They have to buy at local markets and carry groceries home on foot or on public transportation . Sherrill Twine , who has two children and gets $125 a month in stamps , shops mainly at the chain supermarket nearest her in Boston ' s Fenway section . She buys only what she can carry l5 blocks to her apartment . Twine gets $379 a month in AFDC payments and , like Marilyn , gets no child support from her former husband . She graduated first in her class from a Washington , D.C. , program training para-legal workers , but she has not been able to find a job in Boston . She does volunteer work at a nonprofit organization called Coalition for Basic Human needs , which acts as an advocate for poor people . Twine says a food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We depend a lot on tofu , " Twine says . " That ' s a soybean curd that has no taste . We mix it with cheese and other things . It ' s 94 cents a pound . " Twine also relies heavily on beans , rice , chicken , turkey and powdered skim milk . She buys no beef . " We ' ve never actually gone hungry , " she says . " But by the end of the month , we ' ve usually run out of almost everything . We used to have peanut butter for lunch and dinner . Now we can ' t afford peanut butter anymore .
