Officials at the White House , the State Department and the Defense Department expressed concern about the new construction at Tartus , Syria , saying it coincided with increased Soviet naval operations in the region. // In a recent report to Congress , Rear Adm . William O. Studeman , director of the National Security Agency , said the Soviet Navy would be able to repair and maintain its Mediterranean fleet at Tartus. // // Increased Deployments Seen // " This will obviate the necessity of frequent naval transits to home ports in the Black Sea , " he said . " It would permit longer deployments and an overall increased Soviet presence in an area of considerable political-military volatility. " // The expansion is notable because it comes when the Soviets are cutting back on naval deployments and exercises in other parts of the world , both to save money and to project a more benign image to Western Europe and the United States. // Norman Polmar , an expert on the Soviet Navy , said it was correct to refer to Tartus as a Soviet naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets ' only operating naval base in the Mediterranean. " // Asked to describe its effect on regional security , Mr. Polmar said the new installation at Tartus " permits the Soviets to operate their naval forces more efficiently and effectively , and to keep ships in the Mediterranean at a high state of readiness. " // Mr. Polmar , a consultant to the United States Navy , said he believed that the United States should protest to Syria over the expansion of Tartus and try harder to get more bases for American ships in the Mediterranean. // At Tartus , he said , Soviet warships take on fuel , bombs , missiles and other munitions . The base is used by Soviet submarines , cruisers , destroyers , minesweepers and landing ships , he said . The surface ships come from the Black Sea Fleet . The submarines come from the Northern Fleet and would have to return more often to distant ports on the Kola Peninsula if they had no Mediterranean base . <> <> Details Sought From Embassy // White House officials said they had repeatedly asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the purpose and use of buildings under construction in the port of Tartus . But so far , they said , the embassy has not provided details about the new installation or the Soviet-Syrian agreement governing its use. // The officials said they hoped the new United States Ambassador to Syria , Edward P. Djerejian , would quickly investigate and report on the Soviet activity at Tartus . Mr. Djerejian , who left the United States for Syria this week , is an expert on both the Middle East and the Soviet Union , having served as a political officer at the United States Embassy in Moscow from 1979 to 1981 . Moscow is Syria ' s main source of arms , having supplied $10 billion worth of weapons to Damascus in the last five years , according to American estimates published by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency . But State Department officials say the Soviets appear to be reassessing the costs and benefits of their long-time commitment to Syria , and in the last year they have demanded prompt payment in hard currency for weapons sold to Damascus. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies more than $15 billion , according to American officials . Syria incurred most of the debt in the last few years as it bought Soviet warplanes , missiles , tanks , ships and armored fighting vehicles in an effort to match Israel ' s military strength . The Syrians recently obtained three new Soviet submarines of the type known in the West as the Kilo class . <> <> Chemical Arms Bid Reported // In addition , Israeli and American officials said the Soviet Army ' s chief of chemical warfare recently visited Syria to discuss possible cooperation between the two countries in the production of chemical weapons . Israeli officials have asserted that Syria was manufacturing chemical warheads for surface-to-surface missiles supplied by the Russians. // Mr. Polmar said Soviet naval aircraft operating from an airfield in Syria provided direct support for Soviet warships operating out of Tartus . The support includes aerial reconnaissance , electronic surveillance and anti-submarine patrols . In addition , he said , the Soviet Union and Syria have held joint naval exercises near Tartus. // Admiral Studeman , who was the Director of Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said there had been " speculation that the Soviet-Syrian agreement will provide for Soviet sovereignty over the facility " at Tartus . " We have no specific information as yet on the actual content of the agreement , but it is highly unlikely that Syria would or could make such concessions to any foreign power , " he said. // He said " the agreement most likely calls for the territory to remain Syrian , " but with strict Soviet controls on access to the site . Under such controls , Syrians could not enter except with Soviet permission . <> <> Relations Said to Cool a Bit // Abdul Aziz Said , a professor of international relations at American University here , said the political relationship between Syria and the Soviet Union had cooled a bit because " Soviet foreign policy in the Middle East is increasingly informed by pragmatic , material , business considerations , rather than ideological considerations. " // Mr. Said , who was born in Syria , said the Soviet Union appeared to be considering the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel . But such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see each other as archenemies , " he said. // In addition , Mr. Said said , Syria has expressed irritation with the Soviet Union because of slow deliveries of arms , Soviet demands for cash payment and Soviet insistence on a measure of control over the arms . Syria sees such control as interference in its affairs. // Syrian officials are also irritated because they believe the Soviets have not taken a clear position supporting Syria in its long-running disputes with Iraq. // The Soviets can not offer the Syrians the economic aid that the Syrians need , Mr. Said added . For this reason , he said , " Syria is opening more to the West , " which it sees as a potential source of economic assistance and advanced technology. //
