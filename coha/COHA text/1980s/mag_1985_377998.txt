It was what old NASA hands affectionately call an Eddie Air Force Base kind of day : blue sky , visibility of 45 miles , perfect for a landing . And as the space shuttle Challenger touched down last week on the runway at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , in 95 heat , kicking up petticoats of dust , a flight that had begun in near disaster ended in triumph . Declared Mission Manager Roy Lester : " Even with a rough start , we achieved excellent science . " <P> The first big glitch occurred on July 12 , when a computer detected contamination in Challenger 's hydrogen fuel and aborted the launch 3 sec. before takeoff . The 112-ton spacecraft blasted off 17 days later , but 5 min. 15 sec. into the flight , a monitoring device reported that one of the three main engines seemed to be heating up to a dangerous 1,950 F. That sensor alerted the onboard computer , and for the first time in the 24-year history of the U.S. manned space , an engine was shut down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission control decided that the seven crew members should proceed with the flight at a stunted orbit of 197 miles above earth ( the planned orbit was 242 miles ) . Challenger carried a $73 million array of sophisticated astronomical and scientific instruments , and researchers hoped that a series of 14 experiments , some painstakingly calculated for the higher orbit , would still work . <P> Their optimism was soon dashed . On the first day of flight , the astronauts tried to deploy a new instrument-pointing system ( IPS ) , designed in West Germany , that aimed three of the onboard telescopes at celestial objects . The precision of the IPS is equivalent to focusing on a dime two miles away . The $60 million device , however , had bugs in its computer software and would not track properly . There was a brief moment when Astronomer-Astronaut Karl Henize shouted , " Hallelujah , it looks like it 's working ! " only to watch it wobble off target . Conceded Henize : " That hallelujah was a bit too quick , was n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar telescopes toward the sun in time to photograph a spectacular cascade of flares and nuclear eruptions . Four days into the mission , the crew and ground control had the IPS working as well . <P> To make up for lost time , the crew crammed even more work into their already difficult round-the-clock schedule . An X-ray telescope zoomed in on the distant stellar clusters of Virgo and Centaurus , recording the precise contours of their massive radiation fields . Toward the other end of the electromagnetic spectrum , another telescope , an infrared instrument , mapped the invisible heat of the Milky Way . A small satellite called the plasma diagnostics package was suspended from the ship 's giant remote arm to measure " ripples , " or the wake that the shuttle causes in the earth 's ionosphere . At several points , the shuttle fired its thrusters to poke temporary " holes " in the ionosphere , allowing radio astronomers based around the world to aim their telescopes through the gaps . Indeed , the experiments hummed along so well that NASA decided to extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
