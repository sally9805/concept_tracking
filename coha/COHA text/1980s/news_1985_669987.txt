A letter from the Internal Revenue Service doesn ' t have to be bad news . Taxpayers who seek private rulings on the tax treatment of proposed transactions often receive favorable replies . William L. Raby , head of the Phoenix office of accountants Touche Ross &; Co. , tells of a brother and sister who asked the revenue service to rule on the tax consequences of a plan to divide a family-owned business . The two wanted to ensure that there wouldn ' t be any tax on the transfer of half the business ' s assets to a new company and the distribution of stock to the new company ' s shareholders . " The stock of the new corporation had a fair market value of $1 , 500 , 000 , " Mr. Raby recounts . " If it hadn ' t been covered ( by an IRS ruling ) there would have been a tax bill of $1 , 050 , 000 , or 70% of the stock value . " Requests for rulings can be filed on questions as varied as the deductibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of a homeowner ' s doctor and the classification of a small business as a limited partnership or a corporation . In most cases taxpayers are warned if they are about to receive adverse rulings and may either withdraw their requests or alter their plans . " It ' s a valuable program for the taxpayer , " says John C. Richardson , chairman of the American Bar Association ' s tax-section committee on administrative practice . In addition , says Mr. Richardson , a partner in the New York law firm LeBoeuf , Lamb , Leiby &; MacRae , ruling requests help the IRS learn " about what kind of transactions are going on  --  things that they otherwise might not know . " But making a pen pal of the IRS is serious business . Some tax experts claim the system leaves taxpayers at greater risk of being audited . Even a favorable ruling may expose other areas for the IRS to tax . Moreover , the frequent revisions in the tax law create an ever-increasing list of areas where the IRS " simply doesn ' t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Alexander . " And pending getting its act together , it won ' t rule , " adds Mr. Alexander , a partner in the New York law firm Cadwallader , Wickersham &; Taft . At the least , taxpayers who aren ' t prepared for long delays , costly correspondence and inconsistent decisions may be better advised not to write in the first place . Indeed , time and money are major reasons most of the 35 , 000 ruling requests the IRS receives each year aren ' t filed by individuals . Getting a ruling can take anywhere from four months to two years , says James Merritt , a partner in the Washington law firm Morrison &; Foerster . Legal fees for even a " simple " ruling average $10 , 000 to $15 , 000 , he says . Some people with tax questions that don ' t merit such expense  --  for example , a student who wants to know if a stipend from a scholarship for foreign study is tax-free  --  do manage to get private rulings . But such requests are often filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Louis F. Brush , a New York tax lawyer and former IRS employee . Individuals can also make their own requests , without retaining a lawyer or accountant , Mr. Brush notes . But the technicalities are frequently so complex that a do-it-yourself ruling request is like " a person having to become an auto mechanic in order to fix his car , " he says . At the same time , most personal tax questions deal with adequate substantiation of the facts of particular transactions , and the IRS doesn ' t issue advance rulings on matters of fact or valuation , says Mr. Raby of Touche Ross . Michael Wolff , a tax partner in the Chicago-based accounting firm Alexander Grant &; Co. , says individuals are more likely to participate in rulings as small-business owners or as shareholders involved in a corporate transaction . They might , for example , collectively seek recognition of a transaction ' s capital gains or a ruling on the tax consequences for shareholders in a corporate reorganization . A private ruling applies only to the taxpayer who requests it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are frequently cited by other taxpayers and IRS agents , they aren ' t legally binding precedents . Permitting them to be used as such simply isn ' t feasible , the IRS maintains . Jerome Sebastian , deputy associate chief counsel for the service ' s technical division , says that thousands of rulings are " signed off by the first-line supervisor who is familiar with only small segments of revenue code . " As a result , he says , rulings " may turn out to be wrong . " If the IRS had to produce universally applicable rulings , the experienced personnel and effort required would make the process much slower , and perhaps too costly to continue , Mr. Sebastian adds . The precedent issue irritates a number of taxpayers , particularly corporations . " The IRS tends to think the taxpayer is trying to get away with murder or is involved in some sort of sub rosa tax-planning scam , " says Larry Langdon , Hewlett-Packard Co. ' s director of tax distribution . The fact that each company must file for its own ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers are considering a certain type of transaction . When it perceives that a number of corporations are jumping on a particular bandwagon , it often tops rulings in that area , says Mr. Langdon . Tax experts also complain that the IRS sometimes reverses itself , going against previous decisions without revoking them . Such unequal treatment can make business competition unfair , they grouse . In addition , seeking a private ruling can lead to complications . Francis A. Goodhue Jr. , a partner in the New York law firm of Dewey , Ballantine , Bushby , Palmer &; Wood tells of a request that resulted in a favorable ruling on a sale of a family business to a larger corporation . While considering the request , the IRS decided that the family business had been " accumulating surplus beyond a reasonable need , " and a penalty tax was levied , he says . The IRS also reserves the right to alert its district offices when a taxpayer faced with the prospect of an adverse ruling decides to withdraw a request . Still , many tax experts maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up-front . John S. Nolan , a partner in the Washington law firm Miller &; Chevalier , says a principal benefit of the rulings system for the IRS is that it cuts down tremendously on the number of audits the service has to do each year .
