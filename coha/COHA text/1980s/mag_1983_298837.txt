Automakers ring up near record profits , but imports still gnaw at them <P> One year ago , the U.S. automobile industry was like a car lurching on flat tires . Detroit was emerging from the third year of a depression that slashed auto sales to their lowest level in two decades and cost car manufacturers $5.5 billion in losses during 1980 and 1981 . But the Big Three automakers have rebounded so strongly that they are now within reach of record profits . General Motors , Ford Motor and Chrysler together earned $2.9 billion in the first half of 1983 , and analysts estimate that their combined income could reach $6.6 billion for the entire year . Says Louis Lataif , vice president and general manager of the Ford division of Ford Motors : " I have a feeling that the next year or two will be extraordinarily good years for the car business . " <P> Nevertheless , as the early 1984 models continued to roll onto dealers ' lots last week , Detroit was still not comfortably in high gear . One big reason : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively against attractively priced , high-quality imports . Japanese cars , in particular , cost on average about $2,000 less to build than American autos and now claim 21.5% of the U.S. market , against 6.6% in 1973 . Only so-called voluntary restraints have kept reading Japanese firms like Nissan and Toyota from capturing a far larger share of the American business . <P> Last month the Japanese hinted that they may be willing to curb car exports to the U.S. for a fourth consecutive year . Tokyo , however , will probably seek to raise the ceiling to some 2 million cars , up from the current level of 1.76 million . The two countries are expected to reach agreement before President Reagan visits Tokyo in November . <P> U.S. automakers , meanwhile , remain financially weak despite their recent profit surge . The huge losses of recent years , plus heavy spending to bring out new products , have left the Big Three with total debts of $9.5 billion . That is nearly double the amount of the borrowing on their books in 1978 . Says Michael Driggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce : " One can not get well overnight . The industry needs several years of high profits to restore its financial condition . " <P> Detroit has climbed to lofty earnings largely by cutting its costs . U.S. autoindustry employment fell from 1.5 million workers in 1979 to 1.1 million at the end of last year . Fully half the positions lost during the prolonged slump may never be restored . To keep their jobs , the remaining workers gave up wage increases and made additional concessions that saved the Big Three an estimated $3 billion . <P> Even as Detroit was closing plants and laying off workers , it was investing heavily in new technology . Since 1980 the Big Three have spent $42.8 billion to retool assembly lines and boost productivity through improvements ranging from computerized design equipment to the installation of 3,175 robots . Such steps , combined with lower wage bills , have enabled the firms to increase quality while making money on less than spectacular sales . Detroit can now break even by selling some 8.2 million cars and trucks a year , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
