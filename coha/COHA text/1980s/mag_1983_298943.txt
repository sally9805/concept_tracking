TERMS OF ENDEARMENT Directed and Written by James L. Brooks <P> The movie begins with anxious , ferocious Aurora Greenway ( Shirley MacLaine ) clambering up over the side of her baby 's crib and hurling herself on the tot , hysterically convinced that she has only seconds to administer the kiss of life to her darling Emma and save her from crib death . Naturally , all she does is disturb a healthy infant 's sleep . From this scene it is obvious that Terms of Endearment is a comedy . <P> The story ends , some three decades later , with the same mother and daughter ( played from adolescence onward by Debra Winger ) confronting the same issue , the possibility of the younger woman 's premature death , this time a very realistic one , in a cancer ward . From this sequence it is clear that Terms of Endearment is a serious film that is trying to say something important about how people can triumph over the worst kinds of adversity . <P> Between that first intimation of mortality and the final acknowledgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with feckless , womanizing Flap Horton ( Jeff Daniels ) and have more children than they can afford on his itinerant teacher 's pay . She manages to ignore the many opportunities life now offers to raise her feminist consciousness to that minimum daily level of awareness required for the modern woman 's mental health ( having an affair with the nice man down at the bank does n't really count ) . This clearly means Terms of Endearment is a cautionary tract for the times , something Phil Donahue can really get behind . <P> But wait . What about uptight Aurora and that raffish former astronaut , Garrett Breedlove ( Jack Nicholson , giving a joyously comic display of just the kind of wrong stuff that appalls and attracts her ) ? Merely thinking over the possibilities he presents takes some comical time . He has been living next door to Aurora for ten years before she hints that she might entertain a luncheon invitation from him . Five years later she actually accepts it . Thereupon a woman who once told an admirer not to worship her unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man she knows suffers that common cold of the male psyche , fear of commitment . This is , without question , the stuff of romantic comedy . Is that , finally , the way to describe this picture ? <P> Well , no . And that , perhaps , spells trouble . According to Hollywood 's favorite adage , it is impossible these days to sell a film successfully if it can not be summarized in a single catchy line of ad copy . If this is true , then what are the guys over in marketing going to do with a movie that its own maker defines largely by negatives . " It was rarely ' Would n't it be great to do that ? ' , but more often ' Better not do this , ' " says Director James L. Brooks , who shared creative credit for both The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Taxi on television and who spent four years adapting Larry McMurtry 's novel to the screen . How , indeed , are they going to handle the writer-director 's entirely accurate description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment in the picture that takes you to the next moment or the next place . You just arrive and it seems inevitable-I hope . "
