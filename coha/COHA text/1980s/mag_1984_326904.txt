HIM WITH HIS FOOT IN HIS MOUTH AND OTHER STORIES by Saul Bellow ; Harper &; Row ; 294 pages ; $15.95 <P> Anew book by Saul Bellow is an important event , and not only because he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976 . That award merely confirmed what thousands of readers had decided years earlier : Bellow 's fiction offers a look at life that is not only essential but is unique among his contemporaries . Bellow has been the most rigorous naysayer to nihilism of his era . He has never tried to hide the gloomy truths about modern life or gloss over all the sound reasons ( starting or ending with Auschwitz ) for a thinking person to despair . His most memorable characters ( Herzog , Mr. Sammler , Henderson the Rain King ) can list in sometimes comic detail all the symptoms of the decline of the West . Almost alone in serious contemporary fiction , though , Bellow 's heroes think that a cure may be worth a try . <P> The author 's vision has accommodated itself most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of space . But the smaller scale displayed by the five stories in this collection does not noticeably cramp Bellow 's style . The old energies and preoccupations , the querulous people and the rollicking backdrops are all here , at full intensity . There are simply more stops and starts . <P> In the title story , a megalomaniac writes a letter to a retired librarian , apologizing for an insult that the victim almost certainly does not remember . Small wonder . Some 35 years have passed since the young college teacher , raffishly sporting a baseball hat , walked by the library and encountered Miss Rose . She : " Oh , Dr. Shawmut , in that cap you look like an archaeologist . " He : " And you look like something I just dug up . " Herschel Shawmut has been reminded of his offense by a former friend , who has mailed him a blistering attack on what he was and what he has become : Shawmut the poseur , the TV huckster of musicology for the masses , the rich author of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiteful , but he can not deny that he is , nearing 70 , a fugitive from U.S. justice hiding out in British Columbia . That , Miss Rose , is what he would really like to explain : it is a complicated and terribly funny story . <P> Shawmut is a member of Herzog 's class : the pensive man driven to distraction or worse by the messy betrayals of life . What Kind of Day Did You Have ? presents a mirror image of this condition . Victor Wulpy , 70 , is " a world-class intellectual " who is trying to keep life at arm 's length . He has " arranged his ideas in well-nigh final order : none of the weakness , none of the drift that made supposedly educated people contemptible. "
