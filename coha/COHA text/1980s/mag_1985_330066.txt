Beyond deciding how to deal with those who disclose classified information , the Pentagon has been working on an older and more basic problem : how to screen out security risks . Increasingly , the Pentagon is turning to the lie detector for this purpose . In 1983 , the last year for which a count is available , the Defense Department administered 21,000 routine polygraph checks to its employees . This year , with special congressional authorization , some 3,500 key officials who have access to highly secret information , or may be under consideration for such access , will be given additional polygraph tests . They will be specifically designed to see whether those being examined have already divulged military secrets or may be inclined to do so . The tests may be given on a random basis . <P> $ The new screening is needed now , explains Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Richard Stilwell , because " the Soviet Union and its surrogates have become far more active in their covert quest for America 's secrets . We have ten people awaiting trial on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those selected for special testing will be mostly medium- and high- level officials , among them civilians , uniformed officers and even private contractors . <P> The new tests will center on six key questions , asking if those examined have ever 1 ) engaged in espionage or sabotage against the U.S. , 2 ) known anyone who has , 3 ) been approached to give or sell classified materials to unauthorized people ( including journalists ) , 4 ) done so , 5 ) known anyone who has done so , or 6 ) made any unauthorized contact with representatives of a foreign government . <P> Stilwell insists that anyone failing the test would merely lose access to sensitive information while a further investigation was conducted to see whether the polygraph findings properly had designated the person as a security risk . Stilwell says the Pentagon is aware that a polygraph test is not wholly reliable , but he is satisfied that it is a useful tool since it has " an accuracy between 75% and 90% " when administered by skilled examiners . <P> Critics of the polygraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns and perspiration , contend that it is most apt to be wrong in random screening where the tested person is not asked about a specific act of wrongdoing . Dr. John Beary , a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for health affairs and now associate dean at the Georgetown University School of Medicine , further insists that " there is no physiological response unique to lying . " The machine , he contends , detects excitement , not lies . Beary adds that Soviet agents are routinely trained to beat the machines and that the Pentagon 's increasing reliance on the polygraph thus may actually be harmful to U.S. security .
