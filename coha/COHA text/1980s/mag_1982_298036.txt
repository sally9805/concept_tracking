THOMAS HARDY by Michael Millgate Random House ; 637pages ; $25 <P> It was the destiny of Thomas Hardy , a quiet little man whose principal excitement consisted of a bicycle ride followed by afternoon tea , to remind his fellow Victorians of an England darker and madder than anything in literature since Lear roamed the heath . The novelist made contemporary by film ( Tess ) and television ( The Mayor of Casterbridge ) was born in 1840 in a remote Dorset village . There , farmers , shepherds and artisans lived in a kind of Elizabethan time warp . But something dour and reductive in this son of a stone mason drove him back beyond morris dances to a pagan Britain haunted by ancient superstitions and druidic spells . <P> In one of his poems Hardy suggests the way the world looked to him : a primeval landscape dotted with " wind-warped " thorn , where a hawk circles above a hedgehog in a permanent Celtic twilight . Yet , somewhere on the far horizon of his stories , a tiny solitary figure can usually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day after the Fall-or , more likely , an Eve . The storms Hardy stages on his heath are nothing compared with the tempests of sexual passion that tear at the hearts of these lonely wanderers among the thorns : Bathsheba of Far from the Madding Crowd , Eustacia Vye of The Return of the Native , Tess of the d'Urbervilles . <P> Hardy himself best described the theme of a Hardy novel : primitive feelings rubbing against modern nerves . For if Hardy was the last " child of the oral tradition , " as Michael Millgate proposes in this awesomely thorough biography , he was also the first modern English novelist . It is the predicament of Hardy 's readers to find themselves stretched out on Freud 's couch in the shadow of Stonehenge . <P> As if frightened by his own demons , Hardy kept a decent distance in his life from all whirlwinds . He spent the better part of his days in the upstairs study of an ugly , respectable villa called Max Gate . Even his walks into the Dorset countryside-referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a suburbanite . Visitors expressed surprise at his pallor . <P> Nor did Hardy ever have his Tess firsthand . As a young architectural draftsman specializing in church restoration , he courted Emma Gilford , a solicitor 's daughter . It proved to be a mismatch worthy of one of his own plots . " What very strange marriages literary men seem to make , " Fanny , the wife of Robert Louis Stevenson , remarked after meeting Emma . She might have said the same thing after meeting Florence Dugdale , Hardy 's second wife , who suffered from chronic depression . Typing up poetry that addressed Emma as " woman much missed " did little to cheer up the second H .. <P> As diligent as a Dorset peasant , Hardy stuck to his desk and produced 14 novels and three volumes of short stories in his first 28 years of full-time writing . After 65 , he became the Grand Old Man of English letters . The Prince of Wales came to tea . Lawrence of Arabia gave Florence a ride in his sidecar . Hardy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to optimism . Not Hardy . He simply turned increasingly from tragic fiction to tragic poetry : " After love what comes ? / A few sad vacant hours , / And then , the Curtain . "
