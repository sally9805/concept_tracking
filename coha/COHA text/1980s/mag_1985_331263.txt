As the last brother in a Democratic Party dynasty , Edward Kennedy has been a powerful voice and divisive force in presidential politics for nearly 15 years . Each campaign season , the Massachusetts Senator has been chalked up as the front runner for the Democratic nomination that his brother John won and Robert sought . But burdened by family responsibilities and the lingering scandal of Chappaquiddick , Kennedy spurned the challenge in 1972 , 1976 and 1984 . When he did summon the will to run in 1980 , he performed dismally and was trounced by the incumbent President Jimmy Carter . <P> Last week , as all signs seemed to point toward a reach for the top in 1988 , Kennedy , 53 , backed out once again . " I know , " he acknowledged , " that this decision means that I may never be President . " He added : " The pursuit of the presidency is not my life . Public service is . " <P> The Senator 's withdrawal statement came in the form of a somewhat stilted five-minute videotaped speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the passions , on both sides , invariably inspired by any Kennedy campaign for President . " But he gave no clear reason for his decision . Since the presidential campaign season has grown increasingly long , he said , " anything I do or say now will naturally be seen through the lens of 1988 . " He concluded that " the best way to advance the values you and I share  --  peace on earth , economic growth at home and compassion for all Americans  --  is to be a United States Senator , and not a candidate for President . " At a Boston press conference the following morning , a more relaxed Kennedy quipped , " Well , here I do n't go again . " He repeated his contention that the issues he cares about get submerged when everything he does is viewed as a move to advance his presidential ambitions . He had been irked last January when his trip to South Africa had been put in a campaign context , and he feared that a tour this week of poverty areas in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy suggested with a smile , " the more important issue seems to be whether my weight is going up or down . " ( It has been going down , previously a surefire tip-off to political observers that he was preparing to run . ) " I wanted to be President , and I still do , " he conceded . " I would have been a strong contender . I had put together a good political organization . " <P> Certainly the Senator had been in a go mode . His fund-raising political- action committee was active , he traveled and gave interviews that encouraged attention to his likely candidacy , and his staffers seemed almost certain that he would run . But the old scandals and family problems were certain to be raised anew : just this fall , a widely publicized book about his former wife Joan had criticized Kennedy as an unfeeling husband . Kennedy 's sister Jean Smith , whose advice he highly regards , advised against another race . Politicians he consulted around the country were friendly but unreassuring . A final and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for re- election to the seat he has held since 1962 . <P> Close Kennedy associates have concluded that the Senator was also influenced by the difficulty of the race that he would face . Said one : " In his heart of hearts , I think he figured he could n't make it . So why bother ? " Said another : " He probably took a look at the political picture and thought it did n't look too good . "
