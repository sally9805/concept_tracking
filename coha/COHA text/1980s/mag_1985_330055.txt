Sooner or later , every Administration is stung or embarrassed by leaks of classified information to the press , denounces them as damaging to national security and vows to find those responsible . But supposing it does catch the leakers . What can it do to them ? Fire or demote them , perhaps , but not fine or jail them  --  or so it has always been assumed . While the U.S. has specific laws governing dissemination of highly sensitive material ( atomic secrets , identities of covert agents ) , there are no statutes comparable to Britain 's Official Secrets Act , generally making all types of unauthorized disclosure of information a crime . Congress has resisted attempts to write such a law as a potential infringement on free speech . <P> The Reagan Administration has tried to stop leaks through a series of expanded restrictions on U.S. employees , including lie-detector tests ; insiders say that since taking office the Administration has had a steady average of 20 to 30 investigations in progress . This activity might increase as the Pentagon moves toward high-tech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Moreover , to the alarm of civil libertarians , the Administration now claims that leakers can be jailed under an existing law : the Espionage Act of 1917 . <P> That law was passed under the impetus of U.S. entry into World War I and has been invoked successfully only against actual spies . There has never been a court test of its applicability to people who give classified information to the press rather than to foreign intelligence agents . The Nixon Administration did attempt to use it in 1971 against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo , who were accused of leaking the Pentagon papers , but the case was later dismissed because of misconduct by the prosecution . Now , however , the Government has brought what seems to be a test case against Samuel Loring Morison , 40 , an analyst at the Naval Intelligence Support Center ( NISC ) and grandson of famed Historian Samuel Eliot Morison . <P> He is an awkward symbol for both the Government and its critics . Morison 's fingerprint turned up on one of three U.S. satellite pictures that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way into foreign hands . The photos showed a Soviet aircraft carrier under construction at a Black Sea port . The Government , however , can not contend that Morison was dealing with an enemy : he turned over the pictures to Jane 's Defence Weekly , a British magazine that published them last August . FBI analysis of the ribbon in Morison 's office typewriter indicated that he wrote two letters to his British editors at Jane 's , where he was employed part-time at $5,000 a year with the knowledge of his Pentagon supervisors . One letter thanked Jane 's for remuneration for certain " items " that he had supplied ; the other described his NISC job as a " pit " and expressed a wish to work full-time for Jane 's . <P> Morison was indicted by a federal grand jury in Baltimore last October on a charge of violating two sections of the Espionage Act . They make it a crime to convey documents or pictures relating to national defense to unauthorized individuals . Morison could be liable to a $40,000 fine and 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication of the pictures may have given the Soviets valuable information about the capabilities of U.S. intelligence satellites .
