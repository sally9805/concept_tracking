The question has taken root in the power circles of Washington . It is thrown up at every White House briefing . Congress , like a hungry dog with a new bone , is jubilantly chewing on it . The question will echo down through George Bush 's remaining years of stewardship and on into history unless he has some miracle up his sleeve or gets a little of Ronald Reagan 's luck . So far , he has not had an oversupply of either . <P> Did a moment come and go last week in which raw U.S. power should have been used quickly and decisively ? It is one of the oldest and most difficult questions in the two centuries of the American presidency . Almost every occupant of the Oval Office has had to answer it at some time . In our age , Jimmy Carter hesitated on Iran and was dumped . Ronald Reagan 's boldness in Libya and Grenada elevated his presidency . <P> Bush has been hailed for his restraint in the troubles besetting the Soviet Union , China , Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always lurked the probability that sooner rather than later , U.S. muscle would be needed to subdue a tyrant . In the minds of many , a doubt has lingered from last year 's presidential campaign over whether Bush had the heart to use power . The explanations of inaction from his Secretaries of State and Defense and his White House staff have echoes of almost every sad incident of our times , going back to Pearl Harbor . Bush 's caution will probably not displease the bulk of American people now . But history sorts out the facts and is a harsher judge , not influenced by popularity polls . <P> " The oldest rule in the exercise of power is that if a nation tells the world it wants to get rid of a corrupt government , as the U.S. did in Panama , that nation had better have the means and the will to carry it through once an opportunity develops . " So spoke old cold warrior Richard Helms , former director of the CIA , last week . <P> That the situation in Panama was confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , a crisis manager of considerable success , claims that in almost every crunch there is never enough information and always uncertainty , and the final decision must frequently ride more on a President 's intuition than his briefing books . That is what leadership is all about . <P> " We were not sure what was happening , but I felt something had to be done " was the way Gerald Ford explained his recapture of the cargo ship Mayaguez in the Gulf of Thailand in 1975 . " Let 's do it " was Reagan 's simple command that sent F-14 pilots aloft on a risky mission in the Mediterranean that apprehended and forced down the Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro . <P> So far , the facts seem stacked against Bush . But he has not had his day in public , and his command process is more secretive than that of any recent President . We know that young Panamanian officers responded to U.S. pressure to rid their country of Manuel Noriega , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree and that a few yards away were some of the 12,000 trained and armed American troops stationed in Panama . Does opportunity ever knock so hard ? <P> Did Bush know ? Was he too preoccupied with his busy White House schedule , not attentive enough to this festering problem ? Was it a time when intuition should have prodded him to act ?
