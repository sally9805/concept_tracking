txt EVERYBODY SAW THEM on television . And on the front pages of the newspapers . Night after night . Kids in ski masks or with bandanas across their lower faces . Just kids . Only boys . Teen-age boys . Boys not old enough to shave , with peach fuzz still on their cheeks , throwing rocks , bricks , stones , pipes , and Molotov cocktails . Fighting a street war their weary parents apparently sit back and condone . Boys will be boys , you know . The sight of these boys and their violence was perhaps the most disturbing thing about the news from Northern Ireland . Boys brought up with so much hate that an afternoon outside playing is an afternoon lobbing firebombs at soldiers . Somehow war , guerrilla war , civil war , is not supposed to be child 's play , but in Northern Ireland , it is : Paul Hogan. a reporter from NBC 's Channel 5 in Chicago , covered Northern Ireland recently . He went there with hundreds of other journalists from around the world when Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a British prison on charges of illegally possessing guns , was approaching death because of a hunger strike . Sands was protesting the refusal of the // Disturbing sight : Made-to-order Irish riots // British to treat IRA inmates as political prisoners . With Sands ' death , some expected all-out civil war to erupt . It did not . Hogan , who was on his first overseas assignment for Channel 5 , reports a highly disturbing sight while covering the troubles in Northern Ireland . THOSE BOYS , those peach-fuzzed youths playing grownup guerrilla fighter on the street , were sometimes being paid for the rocks they threw and the Molotov cocktails they hurled , he says . Hogan says he saw packs of European free-lance still photographers , called " Frenchies , " pay teen-age boys after they attacked British soldiers on the street . The attacks of the Irish youths ended up as " checkbook journalism by some , " Hogan says . Hogan says in the Falls Road area of Belfast , a Catholic neighborhood , groups of boys would approach journalists and ask them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American journalists did n't want them to do anything , but you see the Frenchies always paid . " Hogan says he personally saw Euro- pean still photographers go up to rioting youths the morning Bobby Sands died and pay them after they lobbed missiles at the British soldiers . " I saw them go up , " Hogan skys , " and hand them money afterwards . It was disgusting , but I want to make it clear that no Americans were engaged in it that I saw . ? " Iiiinot saying there doing what they would n't have been there doing what they were doing , because they were kids out of control , but some of the European photographers were paying them for doing it in front of their cameras . " After Sands died , they expected more action than they found , and not being satisfied , they brought out their checkbooks . It was deplorable . A significant part of the European press seemed to have no qualms in paying for action in front of their cameras . It 's sad , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has conplained of reports of European photographers ' paying youths to throw rocks at soldiers but has been extremely critical of the coverage of Northern Ireland by some of the members of the American press as well . " I did n't see anyone pay off the kids on the street who were rioting , " says Bill Mullen , The Tribune 's reporter who was sent there . " But a lot of reporters were talking about it at the Europa Hotel , where everyone was staying , " Hogan says . " Some of the veterans were complaining , like an ABC network producer who 'd covered the war in Somalia , the war in Lebanon . Ho was so disgusted about these free-lance photographers and their way of paying these kids  --  and he saw them do it  --  that he asked to get transferred out of there . He felt they were staging things and their photos were projecting a false story of what was actually going on . " ? The ABC producer was not the only Americanjournalist who got fed up with the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American TV network correspondent , Hogan says , saw a photographer paying the kids on the street to lob their molotov cocktails in front of his camera . The correspondent went over and pointed out that what the photographer was doing was dangerous  --  dangerous to the young boys throwing them , dangerous to the British soldiers being thrown at , and , most of all , dangerous to the reporters who were there . " A fistfight broke out , " Hogan says , ? between the two men . " All the boys stopped throwing their Molotov cocktails and gathered around to watch . The soldiers stopped shooting and peered around the buildings , and the riot stopped so everyone could watch the fist-fight . By the way , the American won . " VIOLENCE IS ENOUGH of a way of life in Northern Ireland . It is a sad commentary that European photographers looking for a picture feel they have to pay a bunch of boys to get one , reward- lug them for doing it at just the right angle . There were enough natural candid pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing boys , young ones , always young ones , in masks on the - streets , trying to fight their parents ' war . Bill Mullen recalls that while in the Catholic section one day , a bunch or young boys began . to barrage two ar- ? mored personnel carriers with bricks and rocks and whatever else they could grab , as they passed down the street . " Suddenly , " Mullen says , " one of them stopped , and the doors opened , and British soldiers jumped out : The kids turned and ran , terrified . While the rest of the soldiers hunched down with their guns , one soldier ran after the kids . " He caught one , a small , 10-year-oldlooking boy , and he brought.him back to the armored car . While the other soldiers squatted around to fend off a possible attack , and the adults stood in every doorway watching , the soldier sat the little boy down next to him and began shaking his finger . He was bawling the little boy out . " Now , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
