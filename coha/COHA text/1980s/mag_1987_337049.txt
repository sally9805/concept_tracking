Uncertainty . Volatility . Confusion . Those have become the watchwords of the postcrash economy . For weeks some prognosticators have warned that the stock collapse of Black Monday presaged a recession . Others have argued just as vehemently that the crash was primarily a Wall Street event that will have little impact on the economy . No wonder consumers have been cautious and bewildered and the financial markets have swung wildly between hope and despair . <P> Last week 's upheavals only made the economic outlook fuzzier . One of the strongest stock rallies since the crash suddenly fizzled when the Government announced that the U.S. trade deficit had hit a record $17.6 billion in October , up 25% from September . The news threw the world 's currency traders into a frenzy , and the dollar plummeted to its lowest levels against the Japanese yen and the West German mark since the 1940s . The turmoil could not help pushing urgent questions into the minds of every reader of the financial pages : What is going on with the U.S. economy , and what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most informed opinion possible on the outlook , TIME last week conducted its own survey of 17 leading forecasters . They were chosen for their reputations and the accuracy of their past predictions . The economists represent academia , the financial community and business , and include several experts from Europe and Japan . <P> Their views on the U.S. economy for 1988 were far from uniform , but the majority opinion was firm and a bit surprising . Despite the stock crash , the plunging dollar and the scary new trade figures , most of the economists insist that America will muddle along next year with no recession , no significant rise in unemployment or inflation and only a modest increase in interest rates . Their median forecast is for growth in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation , to slow only slightly , from 3.4% this year to 2.7% in 1988 .

It appears we are going to have a vigorous economy next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Much to everyone 's surprise , the economy did n't even flinch from the crash . Clearly , I do not see a recession coming . " <P> The economists acknowledged that consumers have become more subdued since the crash ; the Commerce Department reported last week that retail sales in November were up a meager .2% from the previous month . But the forecasters felt confident that other sources of growth besides consumer spending would power the economy in 1988 . In particular , the experts were convinced that the falling dollar , by making American products cheaper , will fuel a continuing surge in U.S. exports . <P> Moreover , Americans will turn increasingly to homemade goods rather than imports . " A larger share of total domestic demand will be satisfied by domestic production , " says Saul Hymans , professor of economics at the University of Michigan . To meet the increased demand , U.S. companies will have to boost capacity , and that will give a forceful stimulus to capital goods industries .
