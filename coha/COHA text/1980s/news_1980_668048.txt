If Gerry Cheevers is Money and Rick Middleton is Magic , then Don Marcotte must be The Stabilizer . Last night he played a regular shift for an entire game for the first time since he had a knee operation on Dec. 11 . He played left wing on a line with Terry O ' Reilly and Peter McNab and was the unsung , unawarded star of the night . He scored Boston ' s second goal in the second period , but that ' s not all . He does other things , most of which usually go unnoticed . An example : In the second period , while the Bruins were holding a 3- 0 lead , he saw the puck go back to Brad McCrimmon at the right point . Pittsburgh ' s Nick Libett was moving toward the Boston defenseman to block the shot , as so many Penguin forwards had done so often in the two games . He never got there because Marcotte bumped him out of the way to give McCrimmon a clean shot at the goal . " That ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach Harry Sinden , " and Marcotte gives it some stability . Both he and Wayne Cashman ( also coming back from a knee injury ) played well . " Marcotte has played on the same line with Terry O ' Reilly in the past , and they have been very effective together . He played there when Gregg Sheppard was a Bruin . He played there when Andre Savard was a Bruin . They were the centers . " I don ' t have to spend too much time looking to see where Terry is , " said Marcotte . " I ' ve played him with so much that I know where he ' s going to be and what he ' s going to do with the puck . " Marcotte played as though he were at top speed . " I ' m getting there , " he said . " I hope we can win the next two and get the series over with . " That will be no easy task because " they ' re a great defensive club , one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But we ' re a good road club . They won the game here they had to , and now we have to go out and play our game in their rink . Their goalie ( Greg Millen ) did it again to us in the first period tonight , and we were patient and didn ' t force anything . We tried to be on them as quickly and as often as possible . " This is how much puck control the Bruins had last night . There wasn ' t a faceoff in the Boston end until 11 minutes and 3 seconds of the second period had elapsed . That means 31 minutes and 3 seconds went by before Pittsburgh forced a faceoff in the attacking zone . . . " The second period was it , " said Penguin coach Johnny Wilson . " Middleton got behind our defense for the first goal ( actually through it ) . The Bruins changed their strategy slightly . They had their wings cutting behind our defense . . . Cashman had a lot of fun fooling around with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 4-0 lead . Al Secord had a shot , and the rebound came to Cashman at the top right of the crease . He pulled it back and away from Millen . Then he waited until Millen started to go down and lifted the puck over him . . . " We took advantage of our opportunities and our first goal ( Middleton ' s ) loosened us up , " said Cashman.
