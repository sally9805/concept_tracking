 | Abby Mandel can prepare and bake an easy , oven-fried chicken dish in 75 minutes ( More Taste Than Time . Simon and Schuster. $19.95 ) . Pierre Franey can top that : he says he makes an entire cassoulet with beans , sausage , duck , pork and lamb in less than 60 minutes ( Cuisine Rapide , with Bryan Miller . Times Books . $22.50 ) . Martha Stewart can top that : she claims that in less than 60 minutes she makes a whole dinner , from roast pork to ginger cake and pumpkin custard ( Quick Cook Menus . Clarkson Potter . $22.95 ) . And Marian Burros , who used to linger unconscionably in the kitchen preparing meals that took a full 30 minutes , now announces a breakthrough : 20 Minute Menus ( Simon and Schuster. $19.95 ) . Apparently the only piece of kitchen equipment that 's truly indispensable now is a timer . Beat-the-clock cookery the way these experts practice it is as contemporary as the microwaveable hamburger , but the concept has been around for more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Joy of Cooking , " published " Streamlined Cooking " in 1939 with the hope , she wrote , " that it will alleviate the culinary worries common to most business women and will counteract that devastating feeling of consternation ... on maid 's day out . " Rombauer 's 30-minute dinners ran largely to canned meat loaf ' sauced with a can of celery soup ? a solution that held considerably more charm in her day than ours . ( But as Rombauer herself pointed out , people wanting to cook from scratch could go right out and buy " The Joy of Cooking . " ) Today 's authorities on high-speed cooking insist that it 's perfectly compatible with cooking from scratch . Burros saves time ( but sacrifices nutrients ) by shopping for precut vegetables , and she states outright that if you want dessert , you 'll have to buy it . Stewart and Franey , on the other hand , would have you turning out tarts , crepes and souffles in the course of your hour 's work , perhaps while waiting impatiently for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timesaver , but the microwave oven is still so controversial among serious cooks ? it 's seen as the Jell-O of kitchen equipment that only Mandel admits to using one . All these books offer at least a few good , simple dishes that would be useful additions to any cook 's recipe file : Stewart 's bluefish in parchment , Burros 's squash with cumin and Mandel 's spicy shrimp are especially quick to make and fine to eat . But a yen for the exotic or the just plain complicated is all too visible . Most of the authors maintain , for instance , that they do their shopping right in local supermarkets ; if so , they have access to wondrous supermarkets indeed , where fish of every variety is available and impeccably fresh , friendly butchers are eager to cut up your choice of meat , and blood oranges and oakleaf lettuce are readily at hand . Game plan : The very notion of a 20- or 30- or 60-minute meal becomes intimidating once you 're in the kitchen with that invisible timekeeper hovering over you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean you 're out of sesame seeds , did n't you check the shelf ? It only took her 10 minutes to peel those shrimp , what 's wrong with you ? Burros supplies a carefully worked out " game plan " for each recipe , but it 's impossible to race from task to task following her instructions without feeling like Lucy in the candy factory . And Stewart 's timetables really are impossible , unless you can debone two Cornish hens , rub them with spices and truss them , all in the five minutes she gives you for that task . While they bake you get to make Chinese dumplings from scratch . ( " Trim with a fluted biscuit cutter , if desired . " ) The underlying problem with these books is n't that they tend to be unrealistic but that much of what they offer is unnecessary . Why not make chicken couscous when you have all the time you want , rather than throwing together Franey 's unsatisfactory shortcut version ? There are lots of good chicken recipes that fit into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . But simplicity does n't go far when you sit down to write a stylish and competitive cookbook these days . In the end the best guidebook for what Rombauer called " the hurry-up cook " is still Edouard de Pomiane 's " French Cooking in Ten Minutes , " published back in 1930 but widely available in reprint . With his frequent use of lard , cream and canned vegetables , and his rhapsody over the afterlunch cigarette , de Pomiane is clearly writing for an age that has passed . But one hopes his spirit in the kitchen will never be out of date . With two or three ingredients and a cup of good coffee he can feed anyone who cares to join him , and he relishes those 10 minutes in the kitchen for the pleasure they promise . " If you 're not convinced , do as you like , " he advises in his chapter on hors d'oeuvres . " After all , that 's the best way to enjoy what you 're eating . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
