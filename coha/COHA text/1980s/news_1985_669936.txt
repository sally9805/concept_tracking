For many readers , it ' s hard to be dispassionate about anything written by Richard Nixon . But for those who can be , Mr. Nixon ' s latest book , " No More Vietnams " ( Arbor House , 240 pages , $14. 95 ) is a valuable addition to the literature on the Vietnam War . It provides firsthand testimony from the then commander in chief himself on the strategies the U.S. pursued during the last four years of the war . It also echoes and reinforces the principles for the conduct of future wars recently outlined by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger to the National Press Club . For instance , Mr. Nixon writes that " War can not be waged without the support of the Congress and the people . . . . It is the leaders ' responsibility to educate the people and the Congress about where our vital interests are and then gain support for whatever military actions may be necessary to protect them . " Correcting at the outset some of the myths that still plague our understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mistakes made by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations . Particularly useful is his discussion of how the initial will and resolve of the American people that supported our early involvement were frittered away . Perhaps most telling is Mr. Nixon ' s observation that " we ignored the fact that war  --  particularly guerrilla war  --  is a question of willpower as much as military power . " But willpower was the one thing the U.S. ' s war leaders lacked . As Mr. Nixon reminds us , President Johnson ' s heart was with his Great Society programs , not " that bitch of a war on the other side of the world . " The result was that when Richard Nixon assumed the presidency in 1969 , " no strategy existed either for winning the war or for ending it . " While the next chapter , " How We Won the War , " has a hollow ring , especially to those of us who were in Vietnam in 1974-75 , it does provide Mr. Nixon ' s firsthand account of how he set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was the fact that Mr. Nixon was the only one of the Vietnam War presidents to understand that in its essence war is a contest of wills . For the first four years of the war , North Vietnamese will dominated the battlefield ; for the last four years , President Nixon dominated . While his " secret bombing " of the Cambodian base areas , his subsequent " incursion " into these bases , his ferocious reaction to the North Vietnamese Eastertide Offensive in 1972 , and his mining of Haiphong Harbor and " Christmas bombing " of Hanoi later that year enraged many Americans , these displays of will did lead directly to the Paris Accords . But the tragedy is that though Mr. Nixon understood the importance of " will " in the international dimension , he failed to see its significance in the domestic dimension . By the time he became president , domestic will had largely evaporated and what passion remained was directed against the war , not in support of it . Mr. Nixon evidently knew this ; he considered many options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of war was not among them . He more than likely believed  --  probably correctly  --  that it would have been rejected . Yet he went ahead with the war for another four years . To make matters worse , instead of building a public consensus , Mr. Nixon further undercut it . Like Lyndon Johnson , he did not trust the American people . Just as Mr. Johnson deliberately hid the escalation of the war from the public , so Mr. Nixon hid his secret bombing of Cambodia . By his own testimony , he deemed it more important to preserve his international position  --  to protect Prince Sihanouk from criticism  --  than to explain what were good and sufficient military reasons to the American people . Just as Mr. Johnson had been blinded to the need to build and maintain a public consensus by his domestic goals , so Mr. Nixon was blinded by his international goals . As he writes , " When I came into office , I had two major long-term foreign policy goals : to open a new relationship with the People ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiation rather than confrontation with the Soviet Union . " Indeed , one reason he rejected a proposed option of fighting the war to a conventional victory was that it would " destroy our chances of developing a new relationship with the Soviet Union and the People ' s Republic of China . " In retrospect , it is obvious that Mr. Nixon made the same mistake that President Woodrow Wilson made in 1918 . Although he " won " the war , he did not lay the groundwork with the American people or Congress to win the " peace . " Mr. Nixon devotes a full chapter to blaming Congress for " losing the peace " without facing up to the fact that because of his own failure to build a public consensus , Congress was accurately reflecting the will of the people when it subsequently limited further aid to South Vietnam . In short , he forgot that foreign relations begin at home . In his final chapter on how to deal with future crises , Mr. Nixon seems to have learned this lesson . If the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition that in the U.S. supreme authority rests ultimately with the people , not the president , then our travail there will not have been entirely in vain.  --  - Col.
