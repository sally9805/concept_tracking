Women who work or live together tend to get their menstrual cycles in sync . That curious phenomenon , known for years by scientists and many ordinary folk , has long been suspected as an indication that humans , like insects and some mammals , communicate subtly by sexual aromas known as pheromones . Last week Philadelphia researchers weighed in with two reports showing that scents , including underarm odors , do indeed affect menstrual cycles . <P> The reports came with a kicker : male scents play a role in maintaining the health of women , particularly the health of the female reproductive system . Researchers at the Monell Chemical Senses Center and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine have found that women who have sex with men at least once a week are more likely to have normal menstrual cycles , fewer infertility problems and a milder menopause than celibate women and women who have sex rarely or sporadically . So the researchers were hardly tentative about the meaning of it all . " What we 're saying here is that men are really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specialist in behavioral endocrinology who conducted the study along with Organic Chemist George Preti . " If you look at all the data , the conclusion is compelling . A man or his essence seems essential for an optimally fertile system . " Nor did Cutler shrink from the commercial possibilities . " My dream , " she said , " is that manufactured male essence , in creams , sprays or perfumes , can dramatically alter the well-being of women . " <P> In pursuit of that dream the Monell Center has filed applications for four pheromone patents . The Japanese have purchased rights for research and marketing of a pheromone-based product . U.S. rights are still available . Preti thinks some manufacturers may rush in right now with some sort of essence , even though the 200-odd chemical components of male and female odors have not been sorted out . An effective commercial scent , he believes , is unlikely for three to five years . <P> The link between regular sex and the well-being of women 's reproductive systems has been explored in a series of studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the two current studies , researchers collected underarm secretions from seven men and women to test further the effects of pheromones . Cutler said a " soup " of aromatic essences was taken from underarm pads worn by the volunteers for 18 to 27 hours a week over a three-month period . Male essence , mixed with alcohol , was applied to the upper lips of six women with abnormal menstrual cycles and no current sexual re- lationship . Although researchers are not sure whether the pheromones were inhaled or absorbed through the skin , the cycles of these women speeded up or slowed down toward 29.5 days . The irregular cycles of six women in a control group , dabbed with only pure alcohol , remained the same . In a second group , ten women who received female essence showed a significant trend toward synchronized menstrual periods after only a few cycles . A control group showed no such change . <P> These studies show that the dabbed-on underarm odors have effects similar to those of regular sexual intercourse but not as strong . Cutler 's earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the physical presence of a man appears to be necessary but the act of coitus may not be . Masturbation seems to have no effect at all .
