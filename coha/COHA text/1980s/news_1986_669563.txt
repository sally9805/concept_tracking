Upstairs , as he turns his attention to the agenda for the 21st century , his mind proves equally athletic . He speaks with the rapid-fire vitality of a thinker seized by the subject and impelled by its urgency . Not surprisingly for a man with his background in defense and development issues , he singles out two central items for his agenda. // The first is the nuclear threat , which is the subject of his new book , ' ' Blundering into Disaster : Surviving the First Century of the Nuclear Age. ' ' // // ' ' After all , ' ' he says , ' ' if we can ' t survive as a civilized world , then there ' s no time to work on any other subject. ' ' // The other item he describes as ' ' the population problem - not as a density problem , but rather as an imbalance of population growth rates on the one hand and social and economic rates of advance on the other. ' ' // It is a problem , he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious economic , social , political , and perhaps even military problems ' ' for the 21st century. // Ranked below these two ' ' high leverage ' ' issues , he says , are three others : // *East-West political tensions , which he argues are ' ' distorting our allocation of economic resources. ' ' // *A loss of some of the traditional moral values of American democracy. // *The need for new forms of institutions fitted to a changing world. // On this last point , Mr. McNamara does not expect to see the development of a world government . But he notes that ' ' in 50 to 100 years from now , we ( in the United States ) will find it ' s in our interest to transfer from national sovereignty to international institutions certain of the powers that we exercise now as a nation-state. ' ' // ' ' The longer we delay in addressing some of these issues - the East-West tensions , the institutional forms appropriate for an increasingly interdependent world , the return to our national traditions - the greater difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' he concludes. // Turning to his first agenda item , McNamara discounts the argument that the West ' s nuclear strategy - which he finds seriously flawed - has preserved peace since World War II . ' ' I think it ' s extremely dangerous , ' ' he asserts , ' ' to carry on our present strategy and our present weapons-development programs , in the direction they ' re headed , for another 40 years. ' ' // The danger , he says , arises ' ' because of the environment we ' re in . We are in a world with 50 , 000 nuclear warheads - each one , on average , some 30 times the destructive power of that dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . ' ' <> <> What nuclear war plans omit // ' WAR plans covering their use are in existence - and there is , in effect , a mind-set that would assure their use in the event of confrontation between East and West , ' ' he explains , condensing arguments he has developed at greater length in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he adds , ' ' no plan exists for initiating the use of nuclear weapons without the probable destruction of the civilization in the initiator. ' ' // How dangerous is the threat of such conflict ? // ' ' I don ' t believe that any well-informed , coolly rational military or civilian leader on either side , East or West , would initiate the use of nuclear weapons , ' ' he says . ' ' But it has been my experience - and I think it is a widely shared experience - that military and civilian leaders in times of crisis are neither well informed nor coolly rational. ' ' // ' ' And I , for one , am not prepared to accept the risk that these ( East-West ) political rivalries will not , over a period of decades , upon occasion lead to military confrontation , ' ' he adds. // What , then , can be done ? // ' ' Well , clearly , one should address the basic issue , which is the political rivalry between East and West , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a people , with respect to the Soviet Union . We exaggerate their strengths , we underestimate our own , and we keep ourselves in a continual state of anxiety with respect to them. ' ' // This anxiety , he continues , ' ' has a lot to do with a movement away from our traditional values. ' ' // For 200 years , he argues , the United States has ' ' supported freedom and liberty and democracy . ' ' But over the last 40 years , he says , American governments have backed Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek , the Shah of Iran , Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos , and Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Debayle. // ' ' Support of those regimes , ' ' he says , is ' ' not consistent with the social , political , moral values I wish to pass on to my children. ' ' // The problem , he says , has arisen because the citizenry has accepted ' ' actions inconsistent with our national heritage and national traditions , in order to strengthen our position vis-a-vis this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that , of course , which leads to this tremendous - I consider ( it ) excessive - expenditure on military weapons , ' ' he says . ' ' I think we pay a very , very heavy price for failing to deal more effectively with this East-West tension , ' ' he adds. // For McNamara , better East-West relations include a stronger Western Europe . ' ' This should be one of our objectives for the 21st century , ' ' he says , ' ' to help and encourage Europe to act in a more unified fashion. // ' ' I think that today the West suffers because to a considerable degree it ' s fragmented . If we could reduce that fragmentation by assisting and encouraging Europe to unify itself - economically , politically , and certainly in terms of defense - we would be much better off. ' ' // With that , McNamara turns to the second major issue on his agenda : the population problem , brought so sharply to his attention during his years at the World Bank. // While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says that ' ' the problem today is not , on a global basis , density of population . ' ' What he describes as ' ' the carrying capacity of the world ' ' - the globe ' s capacity to support its population - is ' ' greater than the existing world ' s population. ' ' // The problem arises instead , he says , from ' ' the imbalance of population growth rates on the one hand and social and economic advance on the other ' ' - which ' ' leads to human misery. ' ' // ' ' In sub-Saharan Africa as a whole , ' ' he says , ' ' with the population of something on the order of 350 million people , food production growth rates - on average , per capita - have been negative for 10 years. ' ' // ' ' Now , 10 years ago malnutrition existed , ' ' he says , ' ' and if you have had a negative per capita food production rate since that time , then there ' s less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // ' ' That kind of a situation is bound to have political repercussions - and it has had , ' ' he says , mentioning attempted coups as well as successive waves of migration . ' ' And lest one think these migration problems are limited to Africa , ' ' he notes , ' ' look at our own problem with Mexico. ' ' // There , he says , the problem arose from very high rates of population growth several decades ago . The result , he says , is ' ' a rate of increase in their labor force that is one of the highest in the world , roughly 3. 2 percent per year. ' ' // ' ' The Mexicans want to live in Mexico , ' ' McNamara says , ' ' but the operative word is live . And if they can ' t live there , they ' re going to live here , ' ' especially given the 2 , 000-mile-long US-Mexican border that , he says , ' ' can not be protected no matter how much we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we must recognize as a fact that for many purposes we are one market , ' ' he says , adding that ' ' we have no choice but to take either their men or their goods. ' ' // In dealing with global population issues , McNamara says he sees two ways forward . One is to help nations reduce their population growth rates . In this regard , he says , better distribution of and education about contraceptives is part of the answer. // But he notes that ' ' in many parts of East Africa where the population growth rates are 4 percent - which means that the population will double for those countries in 17 years - the average female during her reproductive years will produce eight children . ' ' And in many cases , he adds , ' ' the females , when asked , state that they want six or seven children . ' ' <> <> To change ' mind-sets ' // IN such situations , he notes , it ' s not enough to increase the availability of contraceptives . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // Unless that change is made , McNamara warns , the resulting population growth will produce such serious ' ' quality-of-life ' ' problems for Bangladesh , India , and sub-Saharan African countries that their governments will be tempted to take ' ' drastic action ' ' to reduce population . The example of China ' s one-child-per-family policy , he says , suggests that such actions can be imposed only autocratically. // ' ' I will predict that if those nations of East Africa do not find a way to reduce the desired family size of seven or eight down toward two , ' ' he says , ' ' they are going to move - without any question by the end of the century , and certainly ( by ) the early part of the next century - to autocratic , repressive , dictatorial family systems that will restrict in the most brutal ways the size of families. ' ' // In that situation , he says , families may kill children whose presence would otherwise ' ' place them above the prescribed limits ( of ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , McNamara says , he sees a second way forward : an increase in the rate of economic development . In the 21st century , he says , the US must contribute more to international economic development as an expression of the nation ' s traditional ' ' concern for others ' ' and ' ' sense of compassion. ' ' // During the period of the Marshall Plan following World War II , he says , when America ' s real income per capita was ' ' less than half of what it is today , ' ' the nation was giving some 2. 5 percent of its gross national product in foreign economic assistance . Today , he says , ' ' we are spending on the order of ( only ) 0. 21 percent of our GNP ' ' for such assistance. // ' ' I mention this because I think it shows a loss of sensitivity to our responsibility to others , ' ' he says . ' ' It ' s a lack of compassion . It ' s a failure to pursue those values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' <> <> Answers for developing nations // PART of the answer for developing nations , he says , is a direct transfer of resources from the industrial nations . But it is even more important , he says , to ' ' accelerate our own rate of economic advance - because we are a market for their goods. ' ' // ' ' It ( has ) become a truism to say that the world is becoming interdependent economically , ' ' he says , adding that ' ' our economic welfare depends on the welfare of Brazil , Mexico , India , and China , ( while ) their welfare depends on ours. ' ' // Finally , what about environmental degradation ? McNamara ranks it as a serious problem , related in large part to the imbalance of population growth and economic development. // Despite a lack of certainty about the causes of certain environmental problems , such as acid rain , the destruction of the ozone layer , and the greenhouse effect , he says the developed nations should be ' ' willing to buy insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by tackling what are thought to be the most likely causes of the problems. // ' ' Later , ' ' he acknowledges , ' ' it might prove that those were not the causes . In that case we would have wasted those funds. ' ' // ' ' On the other hand , later it may prove that they were the causes , and we would have substantially reduced the cost ' ' of battling the problem , he says . ' ' But if we spent 1 or 2 or 3 percent of GNP to protect us against these uncertain environmental effects , ' ' he concludes , ' ' I would suggest to you it ' s money well spent.
