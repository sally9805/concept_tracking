JACQUELINE BOUVIER KENNEDY ABC , Oct. 14 , 8 p.m . E.D.T. <P> The reputations of Nell Gwyn , Marie Antoinette and Lady Diana prove it : courtesans and consorts can lodge in legend as securely as the men they serve . They dress the naked throne of power with their glamour , sex , humanity ; they provide a public-relations link between master and mass . They need do nothing special , for they become what they marry . Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis only needed to sign a brace of marriage contracts . Because the other signatories were a young American as powerful as Minos and an aging Greek as rich as Croesus , she became the best-known woman in the world . <P> How appropriate , then , that in this three-hour TV movie she is impersonated by Jaclyn Smith , the Charlie 's Angels alumna whom a PEOPLE poll designated " the most beautiful woman in America . " <P> Royalty should play royalty , even in a pageant as pedestrian as this . Writer-Director Steven Gethers sketches a triptych of scenes from the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she firmly cautions ) . At first she is a solemn young equestrian , a pawn in her parents ' grim power struggle for her love . Later , she is a budding journalist and the apple of Senator Jack Kennedy 's roving eye . The film climaxes with the White House years , when she plays Guinevere in a contentious Camelot , acting as Jack 's shy , willful , loving wife and then as his elegant widow . <P> In the film 's first scene , young Jacqueline 's rakehell father ( Rod Taylor ) roars home from an all-night frolic , and his haughty wife ( Claudette Nevins ) confronts him in full dominatrix regalia : breeches , riding crop and withering stare . If only the film had been subjected to some of the same discipline . The camera glides discreetly through Newport drawing rooms and Georgetown dining rooms-always the visitor on a guided tour , never the Knowledgeable Source with some dirt to dish . Jaclyn Smith is a stunner and a competent actress ; as J.F.K. , James Franciscus brings crinkled eyes and a Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie never comes to life , as love story or tragedy or even tattletale . The Queen of Celebrity deserves better , and so do her avid subjects . - R.C.
