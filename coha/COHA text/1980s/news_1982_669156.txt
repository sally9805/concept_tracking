A group of atmospheric scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) here is trying to change that . They are pioneering methods to bring the art and science of weather forecasting down to human scale . They hope even to provide the public with a nearly ' ' real time ' ' picture of local weather on a cable-TV channel. // This is one of several objectives of an ambitious program called the Prototype Regional Observing and Forecasting Service ( PROFS ) . In this program federal weather researchers are employing recent advances in computer technology to forge the meteorological tools of the future . Their aim is to increase the quality and accuracy of weather forecasting , particularly of predicting such severe conditions as thunderstorms , tornadoes , and flooding. // Weather forecasting is particularly difficult because the atmosphere is ' ' explosive ' ' and weather is a ' ' nonlinear ' ' system , explains Robert Bunting , leader of the PROFS forecast techniques development group . ' ' In a nonlinear system , you can drop a pebble into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulder and get a ripple , ' ' he explains . Similarly , a devastating storm can form with explosive suddenness out of apparently benign atmospheric conditions . Or , every indicator can be ripe for the formation of a tornado and nothing will happen. // The first step PROFS researchers and engineers have taken to help the weather forecaster cope with his subject ' s legendary unpredictability is to take all of a forecaster ' s presently used sources of information and integrate and automate them . Currently , forecasters look at satellite weather pictures and local radar images - such as those briefly seen on TV weather briefings - and combine them mentally . This is a difficult process because the images are different in scale and time . Also , these meteorological tools provide a tremendous amount of information , much of which forecasters can not currently use. // ' ' The human mind simply can not completely comprehend satellite or radar pictures , let alone integrate them , so we are using a computer to assist the man , ' ' explains Dr. Donald Beran , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this approach at a PROFS terminal. // On the computer screen flashes a satellite picture of the US last summer . It has been retrieved from a data bank . With a few keystrokes , the angel ' s hair pattern of cloud is set in motion above the familiar outline of the states . Suddenly , ominous spots of red appear . One is in northeast Colorado . Bunting explains that the computer has been set to display with red highlighting certain conditions indicative of thunderstorm formation. // With a few more keystrokes the picture zooms down on the storm . It also makes an effortless transition from the satellite image to that of the local weather radar . Now the screen is filled with the color image of a summer thunderstorm , which appears as ragged , concentric rings of various colors . ' ' The different colors correspond to different amounts of rainfall , ' ' he explains . With the touch of another key , the storm begins to move across the screen and its shape changes. // To date , NOAA has spent $10 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Pautz , a hydrologist in the Denver office of the National Weather Service . The weather service office will get a terminal to test this spring . ' ' I ' m really quite impressed with the progress they ' ve made in the last year . We ' re really looking forward to getting the equipment , ' ' he says , adding , ' ' It will make Denver the most exciting weather service office to work in for the next few years. ' ' // It ' s hard to say what effect this new technology will have on the quality of forecasts , Mr. Pautz says . But he believes it will improve them . NOAA intends to compare forecasts made with and without PROFS to determine definitively what effect these added capabilities have on the art of weathercasting , Dr. Beran says. // The initial area to look for benefits will be in severe storm warnings , Mr. Pautz believes . Also , he thinks the animation capabilities will help forecasters , particularly in compiling morning forecasts . It relieves the forecaster of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time putting out fires , it should give us time to anticipate events , ' ' the National Weather Service hydrologist says. // So far , PROFS has concentrated mainly on improving the meteorologist ' s picture of what is happening . But the NOAA scientists are also attempting to build in automated predictive capability as well . Utilizing standard programs , the researchers are experimenting with two  --  to six-hour weather ' ' projections ' ' that will estimate the future course of storm tracks . They are also working on a program that will predict the amount of snowfall in different areas in the Denver region. // In the second phase of this program , the federal atmospheric scientists hope to put new sources of weather information at forecasters ' fingertips . For years , weather researchers have been frustrated by how little of their efF rts are incorporated into operational forecasting . In part , PROFS was originally conceived as a way to smooth this translation of research into practice. // One essential aspect of this is a much denser network of weather stations . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s net , ' ' is how Mr. Bunting puts it . Today , forecasters are trying to construct their pictures of weather patterns from observing stations often hundreds of miles apart , so spotting severe storms , which typically are 10 miles across , is usually a matter of happenstance. // Enter the concept of the ' ' mesoscale ' ' net . This is a dense regional array of automated radar and ground weather stations . Currently , most forecasting is done on the ' ' synoptic ' ' or global scale . In many conditions , say ' ' scattered showers , ' ' an accurate synoptic scale prediction can appear wrong at any given location . Hence the importance of a regional weather network that allows forecasters to better tailor forecasts for a specific locale and to aid in issuing more accurate storm warnings. // An Achilles ' heel in the current weather system is the difficulty and expense in gathering vertical temperature profiles of the atmosphere . This is one of the most valuable of atmospheric measurements . Yet it is only taken twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers are in the process of perfecting what they hope will be a more cost-effective way of gathering this valuable weather information . This is a device called a profiler . It sends a beam of laser light vertically into the air . By the way it is reflected back analysts can determine the air temperature at different altitudes . Totally automated , these profilers would transmit their measurements back to the main PROFS system where the data would be integrated with other sources of information about the atmosphere. // Another instrument the researchers are eager to incorporate into the system is Doppler radar . This is a radar that measures the motion of rain drops and other particles in the air . In this fashion , it can directly measure wind patterns : another crucial and often missing link in weather reconstructions . A major problem with this type of radar has been interpreting the tremendous amount of information it generates . The NOAA scientists believe the PROFS computers can overcome this hurdle. // ' ' By 1983 we expect to have a full-blown demonstration of the advanced system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes as planned , the PROFS equipment will gradually be introduced into National Weather Service offices around the nation. // The effect this will have on the accuracy of forecasts and weather warnings is a matter of speculation at this time . But one private forecaster who has tried PROFS says , ' ' It ' s like the difference between alchemy and chemistry ! ' ' // //
