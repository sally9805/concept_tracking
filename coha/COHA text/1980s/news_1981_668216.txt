Scientist , engineer and editor Harry Rowe Mimno , 81 , of Lexington , a professor of applied physics at Harvard University for 40 years , died Thursday in a Lexington nursing home . Dr. Mimno , Gordon McKay professor of applied physics-emeritus at Harvard ' s Cruft Laboratory , taught basic courses in electronic wave propagation and pulse techniques . He was a naturally gifted teacher who took pride in the way his students applied electronics to the development of radar , television , computers and air navigation . He was born in Chicago and grew up above his father ' s hardware store in Pleasantville , N.Y . His youthful interest in radio led him to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y . But World War I broke out and at age 18 he joined the first class of Reserve Officer Training Cadets being formed on an experimental basis on the Rensselaer campus . After service in the artillery and the Army Signal Corps he returned to RPI where he established the first college radio station in the country , later designated WHAZ , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand , from Troy , N.Y . He was graduated from RPI with a degree in electrical engineering and became a registered professional engineer as well . Dr. Mimno ' s interest in long distance radio led him to Harvard where he received his master of science degree in 1926 . His field of study was ionospheric radio reflection , the phenomenon which allows radio communication around the globe . He earned a Phd at Harvard and joined the faculty in 1932 . His courses specialized in electronic applications in microseconds and ultimately in nanoseconds ( one billioneth of a second ) . Soon after the bombing of Pearl Harbor during World War II , the need to train servicemen in the then secret radar and radio navigation was acute , and Dr. Mimno proposed the use of the Harvard graduate campus to train 6000 men in the elements of electronics in 6-month crash courses . The theoretical aspect was taught at Harvard , after which students moved to laboratories at Massachusetts Institute of Technology for practice with new radar equipment being invented . Shortly after the war , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical publications for the former American Institute of Electrical Engineers , now known as the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) , one of the largest scientific associations in this country . Dr. Mimno was dedicated to improving the use of the English language in scientifc publications . In 1979 the IEEE established the Harry Rowe Mimno Award , which is given annually to the author of a scientific paper who combines good writing with research . Dr. Mimno was also a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He leaves his wife , Kate L. Mimno ; two sons , Pieter of Marblehead and Gerald Mimno of Melrose ; two daughters , Erika Brigham of Newport , R.I. , and Jennifer McLaughlin of Boston , and three grandchildren . A memorial service will be held on the anniversary of Dr. Mimno ' s birthday Friday , May 8 , at 8 p.m. , in Follen Community Church , East Lexington . Burial will be private .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
