genius . I 'm not . " Special care is given the selection of material , and Julio stresses that he has to be in love with a song before including it in an album . The relationship ca n't be a brief flirtation , but a tilldeath-do-us-part type of commitment . " We live with a song , " says Ram &; Arcusa , who traded a thriving career as a vocalist in Spain for the behind-the-scenes role of the record producer for his friend . " We listen to it a hundred , a thousand times . If we do n't get tired of it , it 's a good song . A keeper . Sometimes we pull a song from an album at the last minute . " Even after a record is safely on the shelves , Julio does n't let go . He frets about its acceptance and tracks its sales as a measure of public approval . " I get crazy , " he admits . " I call everybody in the morning to see how we 're doing . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record and follow me . This is a problem the artist has . " But the insecurity does n't show . Sprawled on the peach-colored couch , his feet propped on a glass coffee table , he 's laid-back , composed , totally in control . He banters with the housekeeper who serves tumblers of cool apple juice , keeps abreast of the air-conditioning project via two perspiring technicians crisscrossing the room with pliers and screwdrivers and comforts an Argentine TV personality who flew to Nassau for an interview and neglected to pack a shirt . The broadcaster stands , embarrassed , with hair coifed , face made up and chest bare under his sport coat . Julio excuses himself and returns a few minutes later with a blue-and-white-striped shirt from his own closet . " Gracias , gracias , " the interviewer says as he attempts to tuck his girth into the shirt , meticulously cut for the trimmer , smaller Julio . Such generosity comes naturally , and Julio does n't limit his giving to shirts off his back . A member of his staff recalls a shoeshine man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for buffing the shoes of his wife 's favorite crooner . It was his pleasure , his honor , to serve , he insisted . Julio , touched by the gesture , slipped the man his $7,000 watch instead . Julio 's " family " of associates ? few are actually related  --  enjoy telling such tales on the boss . Their devotion seems based more on affection than on deference , as they exhibit a **26;4718;TOOLONG kind of camaraderie . Together they travel like nomads from country to country , motivated by the tour , the album , the project of the moment . Concentration is always centered on today , because Julio admits a dislike for the past . He refuses to let Martinez relese to the press any photos from the early days when he traveled from one continent to the next doing three shows a night for intimate  --  a nice way of saying " small " ? audiences in Europe , South America and Mexico . He also prefers to have no personal mementos or trappings from past successes displayed in the profusion of posh estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows where he 's been and of his grit that brought them to where they are today . He rarely mentions the automobile accident that left him paralyzed for two years in the mid- ' 60s , or the regimen he devised to bring himself to his feet again . But they 've heard the stories of how he swam five hours a day for therapy and underwent surgery arranged by his father , a Madrid physician . They know he refused the use of a wheelchair and that when friends visited him he challenged them to trace a letter , with their fingers , on his numbed legs . He then would try to determine what the letter was . When his spirits dipped , his mother would privately urge the friends to fib and assure Julio he had identified the letter correctly . " As his strength came back he walked the narrow island on the highway between lanes of speeding cars , " Martinez says , in obvious awe . " This helped him regain his balance . Tenacity has always been his best quality . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar during those long months of recuperation . His victory over paralysis and his mastery of the street singer 's style were exhibited in 1968 when he took the stage of the Spanish Song Festival in too-short pants to win first place in the international competition . Rather than hold a grudge against the tailor who had promised , but failed , to appear backstage with needle and thread to adjust the trousers , Julio decided the high-waters must have been lucky  --  so he specified that all pants be hemmed an inch above the ankle from that moment on . " His greatest superstition is to admit he 's superstitious , " Martinez says . Call them idiosyncrasies , then , but Julio refuses to wear yellow , wo n't accept a salt shaker handed to him and , if he hears bad news , promptly sends the clothes he is wearing at the time of the news to the incinerator . He does n't leave his career to the gods , however . Quirks aside , he credits his success to more than short pants . Talent , marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal have played parts in his nearly 20 years of success , and he knows it . That the bulk of his fans are female , middle-aged and romantically inclined has prompted one psychologist to dub him the sex symbol of the menopause . He rejects the tag and emphasizes the youthful-ness of his swooning masses . " 1 have menopause 500 times in my life , " he says . " It 's a state of depression . meet people 12 years old who are full of menopause ; then I meet people 75 years old without any . Feelings do n't have an age . 1 reach people very old and full of life and people very young without life . " He asserts that sex appeal is based in the eyes , and " a Katharine Hepburn is much more attractive now than 20 years ago . " His current companion , however , is hardly Hepburn vintage , but a striking blonde who sits silent by his side at lunch spooning a banana out of its shell without split-ting the peel . Married once , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that focused on his happy family life . The publica-tion , delayed several weeks in produc-tion , was finally released the same day as his annulment announcement . Is he subtly suggesting a change in his marital status while the Post article is in production ? He denies the unthinkable with a " no , no , no , " words that work well in all seven of his languages . He knows his image is one of no strings , Libra ; and the fine line that separates the international rake from the international cad is usually " I do . " At age 42 , he admits to some concern about getting old , but he has the kind of look that wears well : wiry , athletic body , ruddy complexion ; uncapped white teeth and black hair di-
