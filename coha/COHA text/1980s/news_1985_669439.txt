This one , each company seems to say , will deliver the most insurance coverage at the lowest cost , while giving the best yield ( for those dollars not being used to pay death benefits ) . // While there appears to be a wide array of insurance products , all the hoopla has left the marketplace with just four basics : term , whole life , universal life , and variable life . Rates , coverages , and investment performance may vary widely , but these are the four basic products. // // Until now . The fifth entry is officially known as ' ' flexible-premium variable life , ' ' but it is already picking up a number of nicknames , including universal life II and universal variable . By combining qualities of flexible life and universal life - two products that account for up to 50 percent of new life insurance sales - flexible-premium variable promises to grab a big share of the market for new insurance products. // Before rushing out to find an agent who sells it , though , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable life , the premium remains constant , while the cash value of the policy can go up or down , depending on the performance of various investments ( usually mutual funds ) the customer selects. // With universal life , the policyholder can , after a certain amount of cash has built up in the policy , vary from year to year the proportions of the premium that go into investments and insurance coverage . Or the policyholder can use money in the investment portion to pay premiums , thus skipping premium payments for a time. // Flexible-premium variable combines some aspects of both . It offers the selection of investment programs that can alter the performance of the policy ' s cash value , along with the ability to change the premium payments and death benefit as the customer sees fit. // Unlike universal life , however , both variable life and this new product must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) before they can be sold , since they offer mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds . So far , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. , have crossed that hurdle. // One possible drawback to flexible-premium variable could be its high cost . When the insurance industry first applied for approval , it asked the SEC to exempt it from the 9 percent cap on the sales charge , or ' ' load , ' ' that a mutual fund may charge customers for buying shares . The SEC has yet to rule on this request , but since most full-load funds charge an 81/2 percent front-end fee , purchasers of this new product can be fairly certain their early premiums will be reduced to at least that percentage. // ' ' It will be possible for the insurance companies to impose rather large charges without the consumer knowing about it , ' ' says Joseph M. Belth , professor of insurance at Indiana University and editor of The Insurance Forum , a newsletter . An explanation of how the charges are imposed will be contained in a prospectus that must be given to all customers , he notes , but that document is ' ' 50 to 100 pages of finely packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of how the charges are going to be leveled is very difficult to understand. ' ' // Another possible drawback is experience . In the beginning , many of these products will be investing in mutual funds set up specifically for them . As a result , they will not have the track record most investors look for in selecting a fund. // At the Acacia Group , this problem should be minimized somewhat , says Charles L. Larance , a spokesman . Though the funds will be new , some of them will be managed by the same people who manage the Calvert Funds , a long-established group of mutual funds owned by Acacia . The Acacia product , known as Flexible Account Life II , will be available April 1 , Mr. Larance said. // The Prudential product , Variable Appreciable Life , has only slightly more experience , having been first offered on a nationwide basis on Feb. 22 , says James O ' Connor , a vice-president at the firm . The fund behind Prudential ' s policies is the same one that has been used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said. // No matter how much experience the underlying funds have , people might want to consider another step before looking at products of this type : ' ' No one should buy any cash-value life insurance policy ( which includes everything but term ) who doesn ' t have an IRA , ' ' says James Hunt , an insurance actuary and former Vermont insurance commissioner . The earnings in an IRA and these insurance products both grow tax free , but the IRA also has an automatic tax deduction that insurance policies can ' t offer. // ' ' But assuming one has put the maximum allowed in his IRA , there are some attractive tax aspects to investing in life insurance , ' ' though perhaps not in flexible-premium variable life , Mr. Hunt says. // He is also concerned , for example , about the high expenses of the new product . ' ' I have checked out Prudential ' s and it has a very high sales charge , ' ' Hunt said . When insurance agents are selling cash-value life insurance policies , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn , he notes . Instead , they can show how the investment portion of the policy might grow based on three different interest rate assumptions : zero percent return , 6 percent , and 12 percent. // Using the most favorable 12 percent assumption , Hunt says he found that flexible-premium variable would provide an actual return of 81/2 percent after investment expenses , compared with 11 percent after expenses for the average universal life product. // Why the difference ? For one thing , universal life does not invest in securities selected by the policyholder , so it does not need SEC registration and the paper work that goes with it . For another , Hunt says , the system needed to switch money from one fund to another and maintain the flexible-premium feature is costly. // He suggests that anyone considering this new product ask the agent to find out what the 6 or 12 percent yields would be after all expenses were taken away. // Several other companies have filed applications with the SEC and , pending registration , they should be selling by this summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are more products to compare , and perhaps competition has lowered the expenses on some of them , would probably be worthwhile. // In the meantime , Professor Belth contends : ' ' I don ' t think these policies should be automatically rejected or accepted by everybody . What people call advantages or disadvantages I call characteristics , and as long as people are educated about these characteristics , they should be able to come to a good decision.
