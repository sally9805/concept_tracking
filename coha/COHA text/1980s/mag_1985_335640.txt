Pardoning Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays for their ongoing gambling connections , Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth was as munificent last week as a tax man forgiving the debts of Joe Louis . " The world changes , " Ueberroth explained , leaving admirers of Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson to wonder if those Chicago miscreants of 1919 had merely been born too soon . ( Say it ai n't so , Joe Pepitone . ) " I do n't think , " Ueberroth continued , " that we can start dictating who you can play golf with . " So baseball is open again to shills . <P> For Bally 's Park Place and Del Webb 's Claridge Casino Hotel  --  Atlantic City establishments striving to be known for their good works  --  Mays and Mantle serve as paid companions to significant gamblers , whom the gaming industry prefers to call good customers . " I 'm not denying that he plays golf with customers , " Bally 's Alan Rosenzweig says of Mays , " but he spends more time with charities and schools . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as distinguished as Brooks Robinson , Johnny Unitas , Walt Frazier and Phil Esposito have danced around in crap-game commercials , like so many Sky Mastersons in a velveteen sewer , warbling " Bal- ly 's , Bal-ly 's . . . " <P> This is depressing only to those who saw them play and troubling merely to everyone who has difficulty believing that a few horse races and several 1979 Boston College basketball games were the sole sports events worth fixing over the past 20 years . " Ballplayers gamble , " says Sharyn McLain , who should know about ballplayers , being the daughter of Hall-of-Famer Lou Boudreau and the wife of Denny McLain . " You go to the dog track , you see ballplayers . They play cards . What else do you do with all that free time ? " <P> With his free time , her pitching husband , the only 30-game winner since Dizzy Dean in 1934 , made a little book . During the 1970 season in Detroit , when McLain was the two-time Cy Young Award winner , he brought much hilarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting shop that lost money . Gambling data was just starting to appear in the sports pages and on pregame television shows . But betting had long since been classified as high jinks by Damon Runyon , and this was the rollicking spirit in which McLain was viewed , even when he was suspended for carrying a pistol six months later , two years before his big-league life wore out at 28 . He is in a Florida jail now , awaiting sentencing for racketeering , extortion and cocaine possession , 41 years old and facing possibly 75 years in prison . The two Cy Young Awards have been sold . In recent years he tried to make his living gambling on golf courses . " I learned what Lee Trevino meant when he said , ' Pressure is playing for $50 a hole when you have $5 in your pocket . ' " Consider a similar desperation in active players : If gambling problems can lead to drugs , what about the reverse ?                 @ @ @ @
