Walter Shweiger , described the result in his log book " There came a tremendous detonation , with a very dense smoke cloud reaching far above the forward funnel . Besides the torpedo explosion , there must have been another . ( Boiler or coal or powder ? ) The superstructure over the place hit and over the bridge were torn asunder .
