At a pep rally celebrating his seventh anniversary in the White House last week , Ronald Reagan seemed determined to end his presidency with a flourish . " As they say in show biz , " he urged his aides and appointees , " let 's bring them to their feet with our closing act . " But the State of the Union address that the President prepared to deliver this week was less a stirring aria than a medley of his greatest hits . It includes a ringing anthem to the Reagan revolution : the tax cuts  --  including a call for new reduction in the rate on capital gains  --  the five-year economic boom , the resurgence of patriotism . Then the President also planned an ode to the Nicaraguan " freedom fighters . " And of course there was a section of budget-deficit blues , a put- the-blame-on-Congress thumper ending with that ancient standard : the call for a line-item veto . <P> While Reagan has been delivering that last hoary number for the better part of a decade , the tune did not originate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Presidents have asked Congress for the power to reject individual appropriations without wiping out an agency 's entire budget . Reagan has argued that a line-item veto would allow him to rein in the big spenders on Capitol Hill and bring down the deficit . Says a White House aide : " What we 're talking about is changing a pattern of behavior that has existed for a long time . " <P> + Congress refuses to go along , since the reform would strip power from the Legislative Branch and hand it to the Executive . But recent events have conspired to give the idea some weight . The Oct. 19 stock-market crash shocked Washington into the realization that the U.S. economy will not be able to endure continuing federal deficits of $170 billion or more . Then Government 's budget " summiteers , " after much agonizing , produced a puny two-year , $76 billion deficit reduction package . Just before Christmas , Congress presented the President with a $603.9 billion spending bill for fiscal year 1988 . The 2,100-page law was packed with pork-barrel goodies to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union address , Reagan planned to bring up several examples of those excesses , totaling $4.4 billion , culled from an 80-page list compiled by researchers in the White House Office of Management and Budget . Among the candidates : a $300,000 grant for grackle control in the Rio Grande Valley ; $240,000 for a study of the damage done to macadamia nuts by rats ; $1.4 million for a catfish farm in Stuttgart , Ark. ; and  --  in a special dig at the legislators  --  $500,000 to bring leaders of emerging democracies to the U.S. to study the workings of Congress . Not even Reagan has the chutzpah to mention one particularly large chunk of pork : $25 million for an unnecessary new airport near Fort Worth , the hometown of House Speaker Jim Wright . After all , Wright will be sitting just behind the President .
