Road to nomination is too complex , too costly , too long <P> Who could have predicted the outcome of the 1980 race for the G.O.P. nomination ? On the eve of the Oregon primary , George Bush stopped in the middle of his 2,735th campaign speech and , with a faraway look in his eyes , wandered outside . He said he wanted to enjoy the scenery . Earlier , Howard Baker returned to the Senate , claiming he would rather push a dozen energy bills through Congress than endure another primary . Ronald Reagan went back to making movies because there were fewer changes of scene ; John Connolly found it more restful to teach Middle East relations at New York City College . At the convention , party leaders were panicked : there were no candidates . Then they hit on an astounding idea . Why not meet in a smoke-filled back room and , pooling their experience and influence , pick the best candidate ? This they did , producing a man who was acceptable to all elements of the party , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who ... The rest is history . <P> <P> That much maligned figure , the party boss , is looking better and better these days . A growing number of politicians and political scientists would like to bring him back , smoke-filled room and all , to restore some order and rationality to the now chaotic presidential nominating process . <P> The McGovern-Fraser reforms of 1972 , initiated by the Democrats and copied by the Republicans , were intended to open the process to a greater number of people , especially women , minorities and the young . But the new rules have made the selection by caucus so complicated that more and more states have substituted primaries . This year 37 are holding primaries , an expensive and enervating ordeal for candidates that is almost as burdensome as the presidency itself . <P> The process that has been evolving over the past ten years is just as wearisome for a jaded public . Thanks to increasing television exposure , the candidates become as familiar and predictable , if not as entertaining , as Mork and Archie . And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the polls , who's-up-who's-down , can an audience take before it tunes out ? Many people are getting too bored to bother to vote at all . The primary turnout dropped from 39% of those of voting age in 1968 to 28% eight years later , and there is no reason to think it will not continue to decline . <P> If the outcome of this ever lengthening process were highly satisfactory , then it might be worth the effort . But there is growing unease over the kind of candidate who ultimately emerges . That he has been rigorously tested in some respects can hardly be denied . " The energy of the long distance runner is essential to the conduct of the presidency , " says Leonard Garment , a New York attorney who used to be an aide to President Nixon . " It 's a job that calls for that kind of stamina . " Yet other qualities may be slighted by the primary process : experience , acumen , political leadership , an ability to organize coalitions and to work out compromises . Says Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Roosevelt could n't be nominated today . A Bruce Jenner could beat him . "
