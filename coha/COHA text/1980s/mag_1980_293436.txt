This year , after sifting through 92 entries , the judges pared the list to a prestigious few , including Food Writers Craig Claiborne and James Beard , as well as Jacques Ppin , 44 , onetime chef for Charles de Gaulle . Ppin 's book , La Methode , won the grand prize . Gathering to receive their awards , the three pitched into a mlange of asparagus , zucchini , cauliflower , carrots , tomatoes , eggs and rack of baby lamb . What was it such eminent cuisiniers prepared as the camera recorded each deft whip and slice ?

Her coronation in Amsterdam 's Nieuwe Kerk as successor to her mother . Queen Juliana , 71 , who was abdicating after 32 years , was a blaze of pageantry and color . But a block away from the monarchist crowds , in a city lately famous for noisy dissidents , clamored a raucous group protesting not only the coronation but also the country 's tight housing policies . Did the royals realize that the dissenters were railing all over their party ? Indeed they did . At one point during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demonstrators .
