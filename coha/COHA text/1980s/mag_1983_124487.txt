For three laps of the women 's 1,500 meters in last weekend 's U.S.-East Germany dual track and field meet , Mary Decker led East Germany 's Christiane Wartenburg . Wartenburg is her country 's record holder with a 3:57.71 . Decker owns the U.S. women 's best , 3:59.43 . She ran with her head cocked to one side , her gaze slightly elevated as if in deepest thought , as if she were listening intently to something beyond the cheers echoing for her in the Los Angeles Coliseum . And she was . She was attending the voice of good sense . She was pacing herself through modest 400-meter splits of 64.3 and 2:09.9 . She was saving something . // She never needs to do that when running against American women . Time and again her natural exuberance and nervous energy have taken her to 60-second opening quarters and huge leads , and it has n't mattered if she slowed at the end , because there is no one in the West good enough to catch her . But there is in the East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does against women such as Wartenburg . Thus , this was a rare chance not only to race against a true peer but also to test the 1984 Olympic track for the only time until next year 's Olympic Trials , to breathe the atmosphere , to imagine . // With 300 meters left , Wartenburg moved to Decker 's shoulder , gathering herself . " I felt her there , " said Decker . " I felt strong . I knew it was time to go . " // She accelerated . Wartenburg went right with her . In the last turn the crowd was up , calling Decker home . So she kicked harder . Wartenburg could go no faster . // " There was such electricity that last lap , " Decker said . " I felt so smooth and free , nothing could have kept me from doing whatever I wanted . " She sprinted steadily ahead in the stretch and crossed the line in 3:59.93 , eight meters clear of Wartenburg 's 4:01.29 . Decker 's final 400 was a 60.3. // " Coming down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be next year , " she said . " I wanted to store it all up : the people cheering , the way I had run a smart race and how really , really good it was to take on good people and win . " // There could be no clearer statement of the twin themes of this splendid meet in which the U.S. team took on the most organized , scientific and mysterious of athletic nations and did it on the Coliseum 's new Rekortan surfaces installed for the Olympics . But as always , flesh and effort upstaged polyurethane . It was a meet of spectacular battles . // Even as Decker ran , Dave Laut of Santa Barbara , Calif. was shocking his good friend , shotput world-record holder ( at 72 ' 8 " ) Udo Beyer of Potsdam , with his second put , a throw of 71 ' 9 " . " I thought , ' O.K. , he wins , ' " said Beyer later . " ' I have no chance . ' " Beyer had turned an ankle while practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly wrapped . He had n't thrown as far as 71 ' 9 " all year . He 'd fouled on his first two throws this day , and then his third was only 67 ' " . // Still , this was Udo Beyer . " Seventy-one , nine may not be enough , " said a worried Laut . " But he 's struggling . His timing is off . " // That was because Beyer has more strength than ever to control . This year he has raised his best bench press 22 pounds to 627 . Now he took up Laut 's heavily chalked shot , ground it into his black-stubbled jowl , bent low in the back of the ring and exploded across it . His timing had returned . The shot fell to earth at 72 ' 10 " , a world record . // " I 'm very surprised , " Beyer said later . " At this time I did n't think I could set a world record . I did n't think I ever could again . I could n't have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's happy when I win , and I 'm happy when he wins ... but I 'm happier when I win . " // Beyer is 6 ' 4 " and 286 pounds , and a pound of that must be the great gold structure that holds his teeth together . He is a student at a Leipzig sports institute . " But I do n't want to become a coach , " he said . " I do n't think a good athlete necessarily makes a good coach . I would like to do research . " // Beyer imagines that his shotputting days will end after the Olympics . " I have a little daughter , Katja , who 's four , " he said , " and I want to give more attention to her and my wife , who is a very good cook of Thuringian food  --  lots of potato dumplings , lots of butter in everything . Diet ? Not for me . Diet is something you ca n't eat . " // As he stood bemused , towering above a crush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming Games . " The spectators were very good . They did n't just applaud the Americans . I have seen much worse  --  in Moscow , for instance . But no , this winning is n't a psychological advantage for the Olympics . Every competition is new . Laut can win next year . His technique is better than mine . He 's very fast . I tried his spin technique once , and the result was this operation here on my right hand to repair a torn ligament . I 'm old 27 . He 's young actually , just a year younger . But maybe this performance will help me against him in the World Championships in Helsinki in six weeks . " // A similar struggle took place in the men 's javelin . Detlef Michel of East Germany had thrown 317 ' 4 " on June 8 , which would have tied the world record had Tom Petranoff of the U.S. not thrown his amazing 327 ' 2 " in May . Michel clearly was after Petranoff 's scalp in Los Angeles . His warm-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led off with 266 ' 9 " . " A nervous throw , " said his coach , Bill Webb . // Michel took little tippytoe steps down the runway , then flew into a catlike leap and threw with a scream . His yellow javelin sailed through awed murmurs to land at 302 ' 1 " . // Petranoff came back with a 290 ' 3 " and then a terrible foul . " He started his arm through before his foot was even down and planted , " said Webb . " He 's trying to make it happen instead of letting it happen . " Petranoff knew this full well . He jogged and calmed himself while Rod Ewaliko of the U.S. put him into third with a 290 ' 4 " . // That was temporary . After Michel fouled , Petranoff the record holder became Petranoff the competitor . He let his left leg and torso come into the throwing position , snapping their force into his arm as it brought the spear through . " He caught that one , " said Webb , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 5 " . That was the winning throw . // The most heralded match was among the women sprinters . Marlies Ghr , who had improved her 100-meter world record to 10.81 two weeks before in East Berlin , and Marita Koch , the 200 and 400 world-record holder who had chased Ghr with a 10.83 , were invading the lair of Evelyn Ashford , who had beaten them both in the World Cup in 1979 . But Ashford was n't too comfortable in her lair , finding the track soft . " It 's just too new , " she said . " But that 's no excuse for what I did . " // Ghr got a great start , Koch a poor one , and Ashford was in between . With 50 meters to go she appeared to be gaining on Ghr , but it was going to be close . " Then I did something I have n't done since 1976 , " Ashford said . " I lost my form . I started overstriding . It was a rookie mistake . It felt like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter and a half , and Ashford almost lost second to Koch . The times , because of a headwind , were only 11.39 , 11.53 and 11.54 . " I had an optimal start , " Ghr said , bluntly . " Ashford did n't have a chance . It 's obvious I gained a psychological advantage today . " // Ashford said , " This race means nothing psychologically  --  I 've beaten her more times than she 's beaten me , " and ran out of the stadium . // Meanwhile , the men 's 400-meter hurdles matched the 1980 and 1976 Olympic champions , Volker Beck and Edwin Moses , respectively . Moses won his 76th straight race in a workmanlike 48.46 , with Beck second in 49.23 . Then Moses analyzed the track . " It 's slow now , " he said . " My spikes penetrated completely . You do n't want that . You want the track to compress under them , to give some spring back . But maybe after a year of curing it will firm up . Remember , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear . " // The U.S. team was together on that . " We had a meeting on Thursday , " said Coach Harry Groves of Penn State . " We knew the East German women were a juggernaut . We 've never come close to them . So the thing became to think about the combined score . Men and women , we are one team . A point is a point , no matter who gets it . " // Webb thought that the size of the crowd more than the quality of the athletes embodied the difference between track in the U.S. and in Europe . " There are 15,000 people here in this stadium that can seat six times as many , " he noted . " In Europe , it would be full . " // There was plenty for the few to watch . To give the world a chance to get the feel of the Olympic venue , TAC had invited athletes of all nations to a three-day meet that was called the International Summer Games and ran concurrently with the U.S./G.D.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800 Olympic gold medalist in 1976 , showed up , barely won the 800 with a muscular rush past William Wuyke of Venezuela in 1:45.82 and spoke of moving up to 1,500 next year . // " But how did you like the track ? " asked a reporter . // Juantorena seized the startled man 's notebook and wrote in a sweeping hand , " La pista es muy buena y maravillosa. " // " That 's because a soft track is good for these 32-year-old legs , " he added . // The first person to test the high-jump apron was Canada 's Debbie Brill . As she planted her foot on a qualifying jump , she slipped a yard and jammed her knee . " Nobody had swept off the little lumps of urethane that were loose on the pebbled surface , " she said . " Then they came out with scrapers and blowers. " // By the time of the dual meet 's women 's high jump the next day , the apron was ready . Louise Ritter proved it . The 25-year-old Texan , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and then arched cleanly over an American record of 6 ' 6 " . Immediately , she attempted 6 ' 8 " , a half inch higher than Ulrike Meyfarth 's world standard . She missed twice . " You can do it , " said teammate Pam Spencer , who had finished second , on fewer misses , at 6 ' 2 " . // " I guess I can , " said Ritter . " Of course I can . " She pulled back her hair and ran at the bar . At that moment , just across the track , six Hollywood trumpeters blared into the fanfare of a victory ceremony . Ritter kept going through the racket , but missed narrowly . In the Olympics such an organizational gaffe might be cause for an extra try , but Ritter did n't demand it . " I 'd gotten my technique together in the last few clearances , " she said . " But it was coming apart again . " // The first day ended with the 4 X 100 meter relays . The G.D.R . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their passes , while the U.S. men , on two days ' practice , did n't . Willie Gault made up some ground on the third carry , but still presented Carl Lewis with a three-meter deficit . Lewis got the baton , changed hands with it , stumbled a bit , and with 60 meters to go still had those three to make up . // His charge was reminiscent of Bob Hayes 's winning anchor in the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 . " This was the best I 've ever seen , " said Mel Rosen , the Auburn coach . " Lewis kept his composure . He kept his form . " And he won by half a meter in 38.71 , to the G.D.R . ' s 38.78 . " Well , I was anchor , " Lewis said . " I took that responsibility seriously . " // " All they had was Lewis , " said a frustrated East German sprinter . The same had been said of Hayes . And the rejoinder of Hayes 's teammate , Paul Drayton , now came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need , pal . " // But the U.S. women seemed to need divine intervention . The East German women had n't lost a 4 X 100 relay since 1978 . They set the world record of 41.60 in the Moscow Olympics , and three members of that team were in Los Angeles . // One of them , Koch , led off against Alice Brown , who had been only fourth in the U.S. nationals but who can really barrel around a turn . She did that , and had a meter lead to give Diane Williams . // " I love to run the straight , and I love to catch people , " said Williams , who made up three meters of the stagger on two-time Olympic 200 champion Brbel Wckel. // Williams then made a slick pass to Chandra Cheeseborough . When Wckel and Silke Gladisch had a momentary hesitation , Cheese was gone . She had a six-meter lead as she neared Ashford . " Her hand was low . I had to reach . But I got it to her , " Cheeseborough said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was all over , " said Ashford . She brought it home sweetly in 41.63 , an American record and the second fastest time ever for the event . Ghr anchored the G.D.R . to a 42.09 . Then Ashford went through such a paroxysm of joy , including leaping , throwing the baton and screaming , as to make one fear for her safety . " Imagine running that fast on that sponge of a track , " she said . " And I did n't have to do the work . The rest of ' em just kicked butt . " // Her language was not the most elegant , but her movement was . " This . This is what people come to track meets for , " said Groves . // The combined score at the end of the day was 108-100 in favor of the U.S. " About as good as we could hope for , " Groves would say 24 hours later . " How could we know that the luck of the draw had put all the spectacular events on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was not quite an anticlimax , simply an impressive display of the East Germans ' competence . They 'd made breakthroughs into American strengths on Saturday , especially with the victory of 18-year-old Thomas Schnlebe in the 400 at 45.2 . Now they defended their own . // Antje Schroeder and 18-year-old Christine Wachtel ran down Robin Campbell off the last turn in the women 's 800 , Schroeder winning in 1:58.93 and the second-place Wachtel setting a world junior record of 1:59.40 . " That hurt , " said Groves . // It hurt more when Detlef Wagenknecht easily held off a sub-par David Patrick to win the men 's 800 in 1:46.08 . And when Wckel edged ahead of Cheeseborough to win the women 's 200 in 22.52. // An American-record hammer throw of 244 ' 5 " by Dave McKenzie only got him third behind Ralf Haber ( 259 ' 3 " ) and Roland Steuk ( 247 ' 9 " ) . Good high jumping by Dwight Stones and Leo Williams , who went 1-2 at 7 ' 5 " , and superb hurdling by Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stem the blue tide . The final score was 197-181. // The whole G.D.R . team took a victory lap , sweeping along any Americans they could grab . That finished it well , ended it as the Olympics are ended , with frolic , with hand-holding after the inevitable exultation and despair of competition . As the athletes left , some with a last dip to touch the soft red track , it was clear that the Los Angeles Olympics had begun to breathe on their own .
