Michael Hagan 's idea of a good time is to guzzle a few bottles of Olde English " 800 " Malt Liquor and smoke PCP with his fellow gang members in the slums of south central Los Angeles . There is no telling what might happen . <P> During one Monday-evening binge , Hagan , 23 , and his " home boys " decided to have some sport with a rival gang . Flushed with bravado , five of them piled into a blue Buick and sped toward enemy turf . There they spotted four teenagers , two of them girls , standing at a corner in front of a cinder-block wall covered with gang graffiti . Hagan grabbed a semiautomatic rifle and , with a fellow home boy known as " Baby Monster , " strolled to the corner . <P> When the teenagers saw the rifle , three of them ran . But Kellie Mosier , 17 , a lissome , bright-eyed high school junior who worked in an ice-cream store , never got a chance . As she turned to flee , Hagan began squeezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully loaded clip . Just for kicks . Mosier was hit six times in the back . <P> This summer Hagan was convicted of first-degree murder for the 1986 slaying . His sentencing is set for September . He pleaded not guilty , claiming that the fateful day was blurred by drugs . Witnesses testified otherwise . Like so many other killers churned out each year by the ghetto , Hagan does not really care what happened . He does not care about Kellie Mosier or her family or her dreams of being a model or the fact that she never belonged to any gang . " I done did something , and I 'm known , " he boasts , smiling broadly as he lounges behind the bars of the Los Angeles County jail . " I consider myself public enemy No. 1 . " <P> If many American ghettos now resemble Beirut , urban terrorists like Hagan are largely responsible , acting as roving gangs peddling drugs and violence and terror . Despite the fratricide among gangs , most of their victims are innocent bystanders . Says Lieut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail : " Life is cheap as hell in some of these communities . " <P> Los Angeles is home to more than 200 gangs with some 12,000 members , an increase of about 25% from 1980 . There were 187 gang-related homicides in 1986 , a 24% increase over 1985 . So far , this year looks even worse . Drive-by shootings are more common than smog alerts , and the burgeoning trade in crack cocaine has turned gangs from stray hoods into multimillion-dollar enterprises equipped with Uzis and AK-47 assault rifles . <P> ) Gangs are prospering because crime pays in the ghetto . Many gangs have made the deadly transition from switchblade bravado to organized crime , serving as highly efficient distributors for Colombian cocaine dealers . Stiff competition has prompted bloody firefights in broad daylight over market share , while the influx of drug money provides topflight weapons , fancy cars and high-tech surveillance equipment . Once an adolescent phase , gang membership is now a full-time job , enticing many members to stay well into their 20s and 30s.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
