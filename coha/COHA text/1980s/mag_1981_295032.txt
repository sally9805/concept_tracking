Journalists are taught to cover all sides of a story , but rarely can they do it as thoroughly as TIME 'S Edwin Reingold . From 1969 to 1971 , he was Tokyo bureau chief , chronicling the early days of Japan 's economic boom . He was reassigned as chief of our Detroit bureau in 1971 , just when fuel-efficient Japanese cars were beginning to vex U.S. automakers . Returning to head the Tokyo bureau in 1978 , he found Japan 's economy in full flower . Reingold 's split-screen perspective on the U.S. and Japan proved to be invaluable in reporting this week 's cover story . Says he : " Since auto imports are the major focus of contention between the two great trading partners now , comparing how things are done Chang , Reingold and Iwama in Tokyo here and in the U.S. has become something of a journalistic preoccupation . " <P> For Correspondents S. Chang and Frank Iwama , working on a cover story with Reingold was just like old times . The three collaborated on three covers during Reingold 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Matsushita Co. in Osaka and visited a Honda manufacturing plant in Marysville , Ohio . He was struck by how the Japanese cling to their cultural past . Says Chang : " For all its Western facade , Japan remains essentially Eastern . " Iwama , who joined the Tokyo bureau in 1949 , interviewed Japanese business executives for this week 's story . Says he : " They used to poor-mouth their economy , but after surviving the international turbulence of the 1970s , they are proud of Japan 's economic resilience . " <P> In New York , Reporter-Researcher Robert Grieves met with Japanese businessmen and Japan scholars . Grieves , who studied Asian history at Hamilton College and Columbia University before coming to TIME in 1979 , was impressed by the businessmen 's polite and meticulous ways . Says Grieves : " When I talked to a Japanese executive , he usually had an assistant there to handle all the details . " The cover story was edited by Senior Editor George Taber and written by Associate Editor Christopher Byron . Says Byron : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the core is the notion that teamwork pays dividends . It 's an idea that most Americans are now ready to relearn. "
