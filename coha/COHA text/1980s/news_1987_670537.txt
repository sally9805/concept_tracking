Let ' s hear it for film makers . They bring their visions to market through a welter of props and egos , actors and bankers that a mere wordmonger would be overwhelmed by . Considering the vast number of fingers in the pot , and the amount of financial concern that haunts the sound stage , it ' s a wonder any motion picture comes out halfway coherent . Lack of coherence - the inner coherence works of art should have , the ultimate simplicity of one voice speaking - is surely a failing especially of today ' s films , in the absence of studio control and of the adult , bourgeois audience that filled the movie palaces in the palmy Depression days . Now , only adolescents have strong and recurrent reason to get out of the house with its lulling television sets , and films are inexorably juvenile . Maybe they always were , and I was too juvenile to notice . In the backward glance there is a dignity - a rather religious stateliness and intensity - to the Gary Cooper-Rita Hayworth-Fred Astaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking men , those vaudeville gags , those plainly fake backdrops - weren ' t we pained by them the first time around ? Still , there was not that jittery prurience , that messy something-for-everybody grabbiness that reaches out now from the curtainless screens of the shopping mall complexes , where , as I write , " Creepshow II " is competing with " Meatballs III. " // Even a very lame movie tends to crush a book . When I try to think of " The Great Gatsby , " I get Robert Redford in a white suit , handsomely sweating in a pre-air-conditioning room at the Plaza , and Mia Farrow in a floppy pastel hat , or Alan Ladd floating dead in an endless swimming pool , instead of , via Fitzgerald ' s delicate phrasing , Daisy ' s little blue light or the hair in the gangster Wolfsheim ' s nostrils . " Ulysses , " which one might have thought impervious to nonverbal invasion , is blighted for me by the pious film adaptation and its disconcertingly specific and youthful Bloom . Who can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visualize its fellow-travelling hero as an avatar of Sergeant York , or its Spanish virgin as a Swedish beauty ? Once I had a dream in which I was sitting high in the balcony of a vast movie theater watching the film adaptation of " Remembrance of Things Past " ; it consisted of , on a wide screen , Proust ' s pale fastidious face , his eyelids closed as if asleep . I prefer my version to the Harold Pinter script for Joseph Losey , which was written and published but never produced. // Successful movies tend to take off from the book , rather than take it too seriously . " One Flew Over the Cuckooo ' s Nest , " for example , or the impudent version , in which Faulkner had a hand , of " To Have and Have Not . " When an author gets too involved , and out of proprietary anxiety or love of the cinematic art strives to assert too much control , the result may be merely an unshot script and a batch of threatened lawsuits . What ever happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " The Confessions of Nat Turner " ? On the other hand , it must be admitted that Jerzy Kosinski , with some help from Peter Sellers , did succeed in making " Being There " a better movie than it was a book . But then Kosinski , as he showed in " Reds , " is really a film personality , 10 times the actor Norman Mailer was in ( speaking of cumbersome adaptations ) " Ragtime. " // In a novel , the prose is the hero , the human thing ; the author ' s voice is our foremost point of contact and upholds one side of the shifting , teasing relationship we as reader are invited into . In a movie , the actors and actresses are what grab us - these giant faces , all but impassive , like the faces of gods . As Wolcott Gibbs wrote some 40 years ago , the movies are " an art form fundamentally based on the slow , relentless approach and final passionate collision of two enormous faces . " The mounting of these faces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less impressive , as directors , scriptwriters , cameramen , grips , costumers and set designers labor at it , but a bad mounting will not altogether defeat the box office magic of say , Marilyn Monroe or Eddie Murphy , and no amount of skillful mounting will make Meryl Streep as winsome as Diane Keaton . This visceral simplicity of the cinema embarrasses criticism : Gibbs , in his definitive but rather forgotten essay , " The Country of the Blind , " described his short-term stint as a film critic as attempting " to write. . . for the information of my friends about something that was plainly designed for the entertainment of their cooks. " // Now and then , in watching a movie , we are troubled by awareness of something caught inside and trying to get out , trying to make more sense than the colliding faces that we see . On a recent evening in New York , I walked up Fifth Avenue to view , at the convenient Paris theater , a French film called " L ' Annee des Meduses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , located on the French Riviera , devoted itself almost exclusively to the photography of young women ' s bare breasts and , when the plot needed thickening , their buttocks . But toward the end , the characters abruptly began to speak in lengthy speeches , and there was a sudden ugly splash of attempted resolution , and I realized that the movie had been based upon a book , and that the book was still in there , still fighting to impose a plot and a moral and even a twist of suave irony upon this pageant of Gallic bathing beauties , which we of the audience had been gazing at in blissful ignorance of any such darkly clever , print-inspired designs . It turns out that the director of the film was also the author of the book . He did not feel free ; he felt he owed himself something . Seeing the movie made me , with an impulse of pity such as all tourists must learn to resist as they thread their way among the importunities of Fifth Avenue , want to read the book. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
