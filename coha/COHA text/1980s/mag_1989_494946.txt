The Cubist pictures that Pi-casso and Braque made in the years leading up to the First World War have long been described as the first genuinely modern art , the first art to present our fragmented , relativistic way of seeing and thinking . In his catalog essay for the Museum of Modern Art 's " Picasso and Braque : Pioneering Cubism " exhibition , William Rubin , the show 's director , makes an emphatic claim for their achievement . " Not since Rembrandt 's , " he writes , " has any painting so captured the elusive shading of human consciousness , the complex anatomy of thought , the paradoxical character of knowledge . " Yet if MOMA 's show is elusive or complex , it 's because Picasso 's and Braque 's Cubist art is something of a tease . The pictures are brilliant conceptions , but the brilliance is about itself . The experience ought to be mysterious , but the pictures take us to a shallow realm where nothing is happening . " Pioneering Cubism " represents the first time that Picasso 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most famous collaborations in the history of art , has been brought together . It is a unique event , and there are , of course , many sumptuous and elegant , and many dextrous and witty , pictures and sculptures . The exhibition is especially interesting in the opening stages , when Picasso and Braque gradually merged their voices . We go through this show very slowly . Like Emily in Our Town , who gets to re-live a day in her childhood , we feel we 've been given a rare chance to return to our beginnings , to see the birth of 20th-century space , and we 're anxious for the experience to he magical . It 's hard not to feel grateful to Cubism . Chagall , Dufy , Beckmann , Juan Gris , Mondrian , the Russian Suprematists , Klee , Marin , Hans Hofmann , Jackson Pollock , and on and on through artists of the last ten years ? to one degree or another , all owe something to Picasso 's and Braque 's opening up of the space and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hinters , due out this spring from Yarrow Press . of a picture . But the Cubist pictures themselves now feel overfamiliar . Seen after MOMA 's own 1980 Picasso retrospective , which presented the full , and incredible , range of his art , Cubism seems anticlimactic . The sheer size of MOMA 's exhibition also makes for slow going . There are nearly 400 paintings , collages , drawings , prints , objects , and sculptures on two floors of the museum . We feel.we 're seeing virtually everything that came out of Picasso 's and Braque 's studios in those years . ( It 's hard to imagine any art movement sustaining our interest when seen in such microscopic detail . ) The show 's point is that Cubism is more than another art style ; it is to be understood as the essence of the epoch we are still in . We 're supposed to find Picasso 's and Braque 's every move , as they inched along , a thing of great moment . This is n't said in the wall labels , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which includes over 300 color plates and an enormous day-to-day account of the artists during the period . Rubin is saying , " This art is beyond being edited ; we 've got to have it all . " Cubism 's historical and aesthetic importance is undebatable . Picasso and Braque did n't make the first abstract pictures ; there 's always a person , an object , or a floating array of dimly recognizable things inside a Cubist rearrangement . But Cubism may have been the first movement that made it clear that the person , the landscape , or the thing that the artist showed was a pretext , and that his true subject was the sheer fashioning of his picture . Cubism might be called the first art style that said that the artist makes his own reality . It 's easy to see how truly abstract art , art that showed none of the recognizable world , came along in the years right after Cubism . Seen in number , though . the actual pictures are so many exquisite objects . With their buttery surfaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkling light , the oils seem overrich ? like a meal of pate after pAte . Each picture seems to show a net of one sort or another that has been the leading avant-garde artist of the day . He rarely exhibited his work , but his reputation was such that he was often assumed to be the leader of any new development . Other artists were making Cubist pictures at the same time . but Picasso and Braque were clearly on a separate track . By 1909 or 1910 their paintings looked as if they were made by the same hand , and for a while , perhaps in a spirit of play , they did n't sign their pictures . ( At times they even dressed in the same kind of clothes . And they both happened to be in love with women named MarcellePicasso called his Eva , and Braque 's became Mme Braque . ) The earliest commentators , most of whom were wowed by Picasso the person , got wrong who did what . and by the time Cubism had become a truly international movement neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . After the war began ? Braque was wounded and discharged in 1915 ? they drilled apart . Although they remained friends , and 30 years later Picasso might bring a new companion over to Braque 's for lunch and a look at new work , each man muttered and dramatically sighed about the other behind his back . s cholarly research now shows that many . if not all , of the most characteristic details or aspects of Cubism were introduced by Braque . He was the first to use stencil lettering and to paste down actual wallpaper as an element ? to make , in fact , the first papier colle . Trained as a housepainter , he introduced certain housepainter 's tricks . such as making faux bois by running a comb through wet oil . It can be said now that Braque made the first Cubist scullion e . ( He also had the first Marcell ( . ) Rubin believes , though , that I IR ' question of which man made the better pictures is a " canard . " lie goes on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and quality from the rest of his work " ( by which he must mean that these pictures are at the summit of 20th-century art ) . A viewer can have a very different and less clear-cut experience at the show . 1 found that the best paintings by both artists date from shortly after they teamed up . There 's an erectness to the Cubist mesh of lines and to the faces and objects in the works from the middle of 1909 through some lime in 1910 . Picasso 's few pictures of people from these years ? an insect like woman sewing : a man with a hat ( nicknamed a portrait of Braque by the artists ) ? are forthright and commanding . Later in 1910 he made three extraordinary portraits of art dealers : Antibrose Vol-lard , Wilhelm Udhe , and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler . In these works the new language of Cubism goes hand in hand with Picasso 's talent as a psychologist and a spotter of the telling detail . It 's as if the entire Cubist experiment was launched so that , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little pursed mouth and neatly twitched lip , or Kahnweiler 's fatuous smile and folded hands , or Vollard 's massive dome , which seems to be exploding from too much brooding . These portraits are comparable to unforgettable characters in literature . There are more sheerly beautiful paintings in the show , however , by Braque . His best pictures have a shimmery light and a particular sort of formal bloatedness , as if all the forms ? rocks , sky , cups ? were hollow . Even before he and Picasso began to work together . Braque had a desire to make a particular sort of image ? one where a limited number of colors vibrate off each other to create a sort of visual hum . Braque was n't interested in people as a subject or in shapes in space . Whether his subject was trees , tea kettles , or guitars , he wanted to show the way things reflected or absorbed atmosphere and light . In his best paintings he does something odd : he makes blandness a quality . lit the single strongest picturein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pion , and it is n't a Cubist work at all . This very large painting of 1907 is Picasso 's greatest achievement up to the point before he and Braque began working together . ( It is the first work you see when you enter . ) Five naked women , each with another sort of masklike and gruesome face . seem to soar up out of a well at the bottom of the picture , and threaten to topple out of the top . " Avignon " refers to a street in Paris where there was a bordello , but it is n't necessary to know this to perceive that the picture is about a deranging and dangerous moment . Les Demoiselles generally hangs in one of momA 's upstairs galleries where it has lots of white space around and above it . Here , framed by the show 's entranceway. it appeared smaller and more intense , and it felt brand new . With its jutting and unconnected faces and body parts and its breathing , unfinished-vet-finished appearance , it is a much stranger picture than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent Picasso in the exhibition is as mysterious or alive , or gives an equal sense of sheer artistic discovery . The painting undercuts the exhibition . Howare the Cubist pictures of the following seven or eight years any more of an advance ? They 're mincemeat compared to this . Picasso 's and Braque 's Cubism may best be seen as an episode in the lives of the two painters . Braque 's most famous comment about their collaboration was that he and Picasso were " two mountaineers roped together . " It 's an apt remark , especially in the light of Les Demoiselles . His and Picasso 's joint venture makes sense as a time when Picasso , after scaling the heights with this painting and not knowing how to move on ( or even how to come down ) , needed time and companionship . All of orthodox Cubism can be seen as a backtracking from , and a chewing over of aspects of , Les Demoiselles. p icasso 's most memorable comment about their collaboration , in turn , was his calling Braque " ma femme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperament of each man , fits perfectly . Picasso 's great subjects were sex . confrontation , and conquest ? a conquest , or a capturing , of the moment ? and he saw this terrain in a fierce and humorous way . In his best work we feel we 've arrived in the middle of a pitched battle between Picasso and his subject . His years with Braque are among those when there are no strong tensions in his work ; and these may be the only years when women are shady or absent from his pictures . In some way Picasso really was married to Braque . He may have been more in a state of true marriage with the Frenchman than with any of the women he lived with or married . Picasso appears to have been a different man in these years ; in his paintings he was somewhat anonymous , and later , in his collages. he was charming and elegant and cunningly intelligent . lie seems pleased with his industrious self and with the world . At his best , though , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his art from the late 1920s on . " industrious " or " pleased " are among the last things he 'd be called . And is there a connection between his all-absorbing affair with Braque and the quality of his three portraits of art dealers from this time ? They 're the finest pictures of men he ever made . In few other works from any period , of men or women , does he seem so patient . so much at the service of his subject . One leaves the show believing that even if Picasso had n't joined forces at this moment with Braque , he would have come to the realizations of his later art . The example of Les Deaunselles says so . Yet if the Cubist collaboration involved the bending of either man 's will , it was Picasso 's . Braque expanded his vision in the course of their work , but it 's hard to believe that his consciousness was greatly changed . Based on his early pictures , he might have sort of Cubism on his own , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , though , that the movement 's underlying spirit ? and maybe even Picasso saw it this way ? belonged to Braque. ?
