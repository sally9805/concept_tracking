Employing these with meats and a variety of spices , the multicultural inhabitants have developed a diverse and delectable cuisine. // The towering Andes Mountains and the Amazon jungles have kept Venezuela separated from the surrounding countries . So today , this home of many cultures has a rich ' ' kitchen ' ' - a culinary world somewhat different from those of neighboring lands . Historically , the coastal subtropical rain forests frightened the early conquistadors for a time. // // But the forests did not quash their eagerness to discover the mythical El Dorado - a haunting , fairy-tale city of gold. // Conquistadors fought and overwhelmed hostile coastal Indians , then penetrated inland . But , of course , they did not find the city of their dreams. // Instead , they found a dramatic ' ' sea ' ' of lofty mountains , with wild rivers descending to fertile valleys. // Here , they discovered that all types of fruits and vegetables could flourish - from tropical plants to colder-climate crops . They settled this beautiful land and , with the combination of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Unlike Mexico and Peru , Venezuela had no great , ' ' classical ' ' Indian civilization to form the base of its cooking. // The original inhabitants of the country , however , had a number of their own simple foods , which are preserved to some degree in its cuisine today. // When the conquistadors in the early 16th century began to settle , they incorporated these dishes into their cooking , which had already been heavily influenced by the Moorish invasion of the Spanish peninsula. // As the years slipped by , other ethnic groups came to the country with their own specialties . A number of these specialities also began to creep into the Venezuelan cuisine and are now a permanent part of it. // Hence , with a base of Indian- and Moorish-influenced Spanish cooking - and embellished by Chinese , Mexican , Middle Eastern , Peruvian , and German cooking - the modern Venezuelan cuisine is richly varied. // Maize , or corn , formed the basis of Aztec and Inca food . It ' s still the preferred grain in Central and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corn bread , which is called arepa . It ' s the country ' s specialty and is eaten in great quantities by almost all the inhabitants. // In its plain form , arepa is prepared from corn flour , salt , and water , and is rather tasteless . Nevertheless , this primitive Indian bread can be enhanced in many ways. // It is delectable when cheese , eggs , and spices are added to the dough , which is then made into small patties or cylinders and fried . It is at its best , however , when served hot and stuffed with various types of cheeses. // Other corn dishes are also popular : // *Cachapas , fried in pancake form and filled with cheese or meat. // *Empanadas , cheese or meat-filled turnovers. // *Tequenos , cylindrical fried delicacies stuffed with white cheese. // *Hallacas , a combination of cornmeal , meat , vegetables , and spices. // In the humble homes where traditional foods are still common , everyday fare might be : // *Guasacaca , a semihot salad relish eaten with meat. // *Parrilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sancocho , both meat or fish and vegetable stews. // Along the seacoast , where the seafood is plentiful , the housewife expands her menu to include such dishes as : // *Sopas de pescados , seafood soups. // *Pescado en escabeche , a pickled fish dish of Moorish origin introduced by the Spaniards. // Overshadowing all these dishes throughout the country is pabellon , the king of Venezuelan food . The national dish of the country , it is the favorite of both rich and poor. // Made from meat , rice , and black beans and served with arepas , it combines the food of the Indians , Moors , and Spaniards. // Whether served in the primitive jungle huts , in the villas on the cool mountain plateaus , or the mansions of the wealthy in Caracas , pabellon is Venezuela ' s food par excellence. // The black beans included in this dish are often served by themselves as the main course , especially in the homes of the peasants and city laborers .
