It is the story that local leaders like to tell about Birmingham ' s evolution from the era of the notorious Police Commissioner Bull Connor in the 1960 ' s to Mayor Richard Arrington , a black former zoology professor , in the 1980 ' s . Unfortunately , it is too good to be true. // Just as it is hard to think of the South ' s racial history without starting with Birmingham , a look at today ' s racial climate could start here , too. // // Landmark Rights Case // In the past year , Birmingham has been the first major city where whites brought to trial a lawsuit alleging that a black-dominated city government violated their rights under the Federal Voting Rights Act . It was the setting for a landmark Supreme Court affirmative action ruling backing white firefighters that could imperil affirmative action plans around the country. // And Mr. Arrington , who has been the symbol of much of the city ' s racial progress , led a delegation of Alabama black leaders accusing Federal officials of targeting black public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy and black leadership , Birmingham bears little resemblance to the city of the 1960 ' s . But if it symbolizes how far the nation has come in matters of race , it also is a glaring example of how far it has to go and how much more complicated the path is. // " We ' re kind of a lightning rod , " said Mr. Arrington , who has been Mayor since 1979 . " It ' s a continuation of our long history of preoccupation with issues of race. " // By any measure , Birmingham is a very different place from the 1960 ' s , when the indelible images of church bombings , attack dogs and police violence defined the civil rights era for the nation and even the world . <> <> Changes Came in the Late 60 ' s // Birmingham began changing in the late 1960 ' s , when moderate whites began altering the form and direction of local government . Since 1979 , when Mr. Arrington became the city ' s first black Mayor , his low-key style and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economy. // Once dominated by manufacturing , Birmingham now boasts a diversified economy , with medical industries and the University of Alabama at Birmingham its biggest employers . The city this year was named one of America ' s 10 best places to live by Newsweek and the nation ' s most livable city by the United States Conference of Mayors. // " Birmingham is alive and well and diversified , and you can chalk a lot of that up to Richard Arrington and the alliances he ' s formed , " said Dr. Jimmie Lewis Franklin , a history professor at Vanderbilt University and the author of a recently released biography of Mr. Arrington. // Few white residents are so enthusiastic . Mr. Arrington has received about 11 percent of the white vote in his three mayoral elections and is intensely disliked by many whites who make up about 43 percent of the 280 , 000 residents of the city . The metropolitan area has about a million residents . <> <> A Powerful Coalition // Many resent the power of his Jefferson County Citizens Coalition , a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine current City Council members ran with the group ' s endorsement . To some whites , the coalition ' s clout has resulted in a system that elects only those whites acceptable to black leadership. // " We as a white community are seeking the same representation blacks were seeking in the 1960 ' s , " said Bettye Fine Collins , a former City Council member . " We ' re a minority that can ' t elect the preferred candidates of our choice. " // White critics have also made allegations of widespread city financial mismanagement . When black leaders made the accusations about selective prosecution by Federal officials , many whites saw it as a way to inject race as a shield against wrongdoing . Federal officials have denied any selection prosecution of blacks. // Even Mr. Arrington , who has spent much of his administration trumpeting the new era in race relations in Birmingham , now says racial polarization " threatens all the progress of the last two decades. " // " The apparent white perception in our community is that enough has been done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " The black perception is that far too little has been done and that government and white society at large are attempting , with considerable success , to undo any black gains made for social and economic justice . " <> <> Shrinking Aid for Cities // Dr. David Sink , a political science professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , said Mr. Arrington has done a remarkable job given the history of race relations in the city and the fact that shrinking Federal aid for cities has taken away most of the tools that city government once had for addressing urban problems . He said many whites in Birmingham are still not ready to accept a black Mayor. // " You can ' t solve everything in 10 years , " Dr. Sink said . " He was probably the right kind of leader for the very turbulent times . If he was a boisterous Jesse Jackson type of leader , there would have been even more opposition. " // But even friends say Mr. Arrington has made his share of mistakes . Critics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several key instances supported black officials whose competence was questioned , turning personnel matters into racial issues. // " I was accused of being an Uncle Tom , and joining white people in lynching a Negro , " said Dr. Louis Dale , a black U.A.B. mathematics professor who lost his school board appointment after voting not to renew the contract of a black school superintendent whose job performance came under fire . " It had nothing to do with race , but you had people in the black community making it into a racial crisis. " // And despite the complaints of black officials , there have been enough allegations of financial improprieties within city government that there is widespread speculation about future Federal indictments that could damage the credibility of city government . <> <> A Bond Issue at Stake // A Federal jury this month convicted a businessman with close ties to one of Mr. Arrington ' s former top aides of fraud and money laundering charges in connection with contracts with the local transit system. // It is not likely the waters will be quieted any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years , will decide a $75 million issue Oct 10 ; a third loss could badly damage Mr. Arrington . On the same day , voters will elect Council members under a new voting district plan , despite a legal suit challenging the fairness of the districting plan. // Still , if Birmingham in the 1960 ' s was at the outer edge of racial issues , both sides say the issues now are close to the national mainstream. // " I think we can see a microcosm in Birmingham , " Dr. Franklin of Vanderbilt said , " a reflection of what is happening throughout the nation. " //
