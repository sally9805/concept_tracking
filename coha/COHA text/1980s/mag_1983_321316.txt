An 80-year search for " courage and instincts to lead <P> It is still the world 's most prestigious scholarship , despite its echoes of Britain 's colonial past . Last week 800 Rhodes scholars-named after the colonialist and entrepreneur Cecil John Rhodes-convened at Oxford University to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the trust that administers the fund . Among those present was Staff Writer Kenneth W. Banta , who was there as both observer and participant . Banta is one of six Rhodes scholars on TIME . His report : <P> Oxford has welcomed the steady stream of bright and often brash young scholars for eight decades , but as many of them flooded back through the medieval quadrangles last week , the spectacle was enough to give the ancient university pause . " In small groups , they were exciting , " said one don , looking over the scene . " This is almost frightening . " <P> Daunting too were the three days of continuous celebrations . To extend a royal welcome , Queen Elizabeth II joined the 800 returning scholars and 600 spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine of an English June , the Queen circulated amiably through a riot of improbable hats and tropical colors rivaling those at Ascot ; then she tucked into tea , eclairs and watercress sandwiches under a striped marquee . <P> At a special thanksgiving service , the scholars gathered beneath the venerable arches of Christ Church Cathedral ; then they salted piety with a touch of hubris , praying that they might " use to God 's glory the gifts and opportunities with which we have been so abundantly blessed .

Since 1903 , Rhodes ' generous legacy has annually sent a contingent of scholars from Britain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Germany , * to study at Oxford for up to three years . In all , some 4,700 have been tapped to join the programs , including the 71 scholars now in residence ( 32 from the U.S. ) . <P> The annual award amounting to $15,000 is generous , but what has brought fame to the scholarship and endowed its holders with distinctive luster are its unusual criteria for selection . Rhodes disdained candidates who were " merely bookworms " ; he demanded that the winners have the character to fight " the world 's fight . " Despite numerous modifications of his imperious vision , the basic criterion remains the same today . Says David Alexander , secretary of the Rhodes program in the U.S. : " The Rhodes competition is a talent hunt for an elite that will lead . "
