It was 1967 when Frederick Wiseman directed his first documentary , Titicut Follies , a powerful look at life inside a Massachusetts prison for the criminally insane . At that time Follies ' cinema-verite style exemplified the vanguard of documentary filmmaking : no interviews , no narration , no overt intrusion of the filmmaker 's point of view . Since then , the technique has become something of a TV cliche . Prime-time shows from Hill Street Blues to CBS 's 48 Hours have appropriated the hand-held camera and other slice-of-life touches . Even commercial directors have tossed away their tripods : cameras wander about relentlessly , trying to sell " reality " as well as Nissan automobiles and Levi 's jeans . <P> Meanwhile , Wiseman has remained austerely , some would say maddeningly , consistent . In a string of further documentaries for public TV , his cameras have observed institutions from a New York City welfare office to Dallas ' Neiman-Marcus department store , all with the same unvarnished , fly-on-the-wall style . Even his titles  --  Hospital , Welfare , Racetrack , The Store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiseman 's minimalist method , however , is a subtle and perceptive artist . His enduring subject : the way people cope with the stress , dislocation and institutional indifference of American life . <P> Deaf and Blind , Wiseman 's newest work , is his longest yet and one of his best . It is made up of four separate documentaries , each two hours or more in length , focusing on the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Talladega . The films  --  separately titled Blind , Deaf , Multi-Handicapped and Adjustment and Work  --  teem with affecting , carefully assembled detail . A little blind girl , new cane in hand and helped by a teacher , gropes through the hallways in search of a children 's drinking fountain . " I deserved a drink of water for that , did n't I ? " she chirps after finally taking a sip . Disabled adults are trained in sewing and other rudimentary work skills . Children with motor handicaps struggle to master tasks like folding a washcloth or negotiating the spout of a milk carton . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher tries to engage a group of handicapped children in his lesson , but most seem as oblivious to it as they are to the TV set that drones forlornly in the school 's recreation room . Yet Wiseman is remarkably nonjudgmental ; his best scenes are poignant rather than pointed . A class of blind children lie on the floor while three teachers caress them with wispy fabrics and a piano plunks out Over the Rainbow . " I want you to think about pleasant things , " says a teacher soothingly , " and I want you to let the music go all inside of you . . . "
