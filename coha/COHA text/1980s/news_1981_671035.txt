" Thousands of Egyptian youths see some of their own lives reflected in the image of Tallal , " said Saad Eddin Ibrahim . A professor of sociology at the American University of Cairo , Mr. Ibrahim compiled a case study of the youth , whom he identified only as Tallal to protect his family. // Included among those who identify with Tallal , said Mr. Ibrahim , are undoubtedly the four Moslem militants who are accused of shooting Mr. Sadat on Oct. 6 and who belonged to the same secret society as Tallal , Takfir Wahigra. // Egypt today is in the midst of a resurgence of Islamic belief that has been gradually gaining strength since the late 1960 ' s . In the view of political analysts here , this Islamic movement is divided into a disparate array of public and underground organizations that collectively represent the most serious political challenge to the Government of President Hosni Mubarak . <> <> Wide Support in Urban Areas // Although these groups are small they appear to have a great deal of passive support among the lower middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grievances are not met , say the analysts , these organizations could become as destabilizing for Egyptian society as their co-religionists were in Iran. // The oldest of four children , Tallal was born in a small Nile delta town to a middle-class family . His father was a college-educated civil servant , his mother a housewife who instilled in her son a sense of Islamic tradition . Their house was always full of books , and Tallal often sat at his father ' s side while he talked with his friends of literature and politics . <> In June 1967 , at age 15 , Tallal suffered what he later described as a deep personal crisis after Egypt ' s crushing defeat by Israel . He remembered that in the days after the war he shut himself in his room , eating almost nothing and alternating between crying and reflecting . His mother eventually drew him out of his depression by suggesting that he seek comfort in the Koran , but the next two years remained a confusing time for him. // Always a good student , Tallal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria University . It was the first time he had been away from his family and he sought friendship in the campus mosque . One day two prayermates invited him to attend a lecture on why Egypt was deteriorating . Tallal was dazzled by the speaker , a bearded preacher who contended in fiery oratory that Egyptian society had declined because it had deviated from its natural Islamic laws and traditions . <> <> Recruited by Militant Group // Tallal immediately began to absorb himself in Islamic political ideology . His zeal was noted by a secret Moslem militant group , which recruited him , gave him arms training and eventually enlisted him in a 1974 attempt to overthrow Mr. Sadat . This led to his arrest , and he has been in prison since then. // Tallal ' s depression and subsequent turn toward a more fundamentalist belief in Islam after the 1967 war is , by all accounts , not uncommon . Many people feel that the resurgence of Islamic militancy in Egypt dates to that overwhelming defeat. // " Everyone was questioning themselves after the war , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political Science at Helwan University , said . " They kept asking what it was about our society , our culture , our political system that could pave the way for such a defeat. " // " We called it the great silent debate , " adds Tahseen Beshir , Egypt ' s Ambassador-designate to Canada and one of his country ' s leading political analysts . " It was whispered in the corners that the social and political institutions inherited from the Nasser era just didn ' t do the job. " // This acute sense of national crisis and political drift was compounded by the social dislocations taking place in Egypt . Thousands of people flocked from villages to urban areas searching for work , opportunities and advancement , but such things were as scarce as a home to live in . <> <> Surge in Religious Feeling // " Our cities became the cities of our discontent , " Mr. Basheer remarked . Half the population in the urban areas was under 25 years old . Most of them were from lower middle-class backgrounds , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " goodies in life. " // It was in this environment that a general resurgence of " religiousity " began to manifest itself in Egyptian society , said Mr. Ibrahim , the American University sociologist . Some people expressed themselves through the traditional form of praying five times a day while others found succor in more mystical , retreatist or superstitious expressions. // " People were looking for a sense of direction , " Ihsan Abdul Quddos , one of Egypt ' s most famous novelists , said . " Since Islam is the basis of social and political life here - the very way people express themselves - it was natural that many of them should reject foreign ideologies and turn back to their cultural roots. " // " My own son tried everything , " he continued , " Communism , Socialism , liberalism . Now he has come back to Islam . His basic argument was that Egypt lost its way because it adopted alien life styles and that both the individual and the state can only find their real identity through a return to Islam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadat , lacking any real constituency or power base , came to power in 1970 , he sensed this religious trend and began to ride with it . Religious programming on radio and television was increased . Mr. Sadat vowed that his Government would be based on faith and science , and he made a habit of being photographed at prayer every Friday. // While there are no precise figures on how many Egyptians were caught up in this movement to one degree or another , Mr. Ibrahim estimates it to be roughly 20 percent of the people , largely among the cities ' middle and lower-middle classes. // In the early 1970 ' s , this amorphous religious orientation began to crystallize into associations grouped around charismatic prayer leaders or in neighborhoods , villages or college campuses . They provided prayer sessions , publications and the warmth of a surrogate family. // " There was a multiplicity of groups , probably more than 100 , representing a whole spectrum of Islamic interpretations , " said Ali E. Hillal Dessoki , professor of political science at Cairo University and an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations were nonviolent and apolitical but a minority was committed to changing not only themselves but also the entire political structure , some of them through violence if necessary . <> <> Campuses Were Fertile Ground // The largest of the politically activist organizations were founded among the million Egyptian university students and came to be known simply as Islamic associations. // Mr. Ibrahim , who has recently completed a study of these groups , said their members range in age from 17 to 26 and come from generally lower middle-class families whose lives have been most negatively affected by the inflation , limited opportunities and disparities in wealth that plague Egypt . Most of them , he said , are of recent rural background , experiencing for the first time life in large metropolitan areas , " where foreign influence is most apparent and where impersonal forces are at their maximum strength. " // According to professors , the associations took an activist approach to recruitment , disrupting lectures to deliver speeches , holding prayer sessions in the middle of college dances and publishing reams of literature calling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such associations on campus but Mr. Sadat recognized that they could be a political asset in his power struggle with the leftist , pro-Soviet remnants of the Nasser era , who were actively organizing students and labor unions to challenge his authority . <> <> Moslem Brotherhood ' s Role // Egyptian political sources said that in the first three years of his rule Mr. Sadat ' s Government quietly funneled money to the conservative Moslem associations through the state-run Islamic Conference Organization . He also released imprisoned leaders of the underground Moslem Brotherhood organization , the dominant militant Islamic group in the 1950 ' s , and permitted them to publish their magazine , Ad Dawa , without a license . On campus , the authorities turned a blind eye to the excesses of the Islamic militants. // So successful did the Islamic associations become that between 1975 and 1979 , when Mr. Sadat banned them , they took control of almost every student union in the country. // The relationship between Mr. Sadat and the Moslem associations ended after the 1973 war , when the Egyptian President seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Egyptian political analysts said . He called for a transformation of Egyptian society from quasi Socialist to capitalist orientation , an " open door " approach to Western investors , a peaceful accommodation with Israel and a political alignment with the United States. // " This was too much for the Islamic groups , " Mr. Dessoki said , " and all of them gradually began to distance themselves from Mr. Sadat . " <> <> Criticism of Sadat Stiffened // Because the Islamic associations tended to be confined to the campuses and had no national newspaper or party , leadership of the Islamic protest movement came from older organizations , such as the Moslem Brotherhood and the Youth of Mohammed . The brotherhood , which had been the leading militant Islamic organization in Egypt from the 1920 ' s to the 1950 ' s , had renounced violence and was focusing all of its energies on trying to create an Islamic society through democratic means . The brotherhood began to publish increasingly harsh critiques of Mr. Sadat ' s secular changes in the code on civil relations and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the Camp David accords and the peace treaty with Israel. // " They not only provided a critique of the regime , " Mr. Dessoki said , " but they began to offer very detailed political alternatives based on Islamic law. " // Mr. Sadat might have tolerated the critique had the brotherhood not combined it with mass rallies in Egypt ' s major cities to demonstrate its popular following . More than 200 , 000 people packed Cairo ' s Abdin Square at the end of Ramadan in August for a prayer rally organized by the brotherhood and other Islamic associations. // The religious sermon frequently lapsed into a screed against Mr. Sadat and an appeal for the creation of an Islamic government . Several Western diplomats contended that it was the mass mobilizing power demonstrated by the brotherhood that finally provoked Mr. Sadat into enforcing a ban on its activities and arresting about 1 , 500 of its adherents a month before his assassination . <> <> Other Militant Groups Spring Up // Parallel to the growth of the brotherhood was the rise of a hard core of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic law could be established only through the violent removal of the existing leadership. // The semiofficial Egyptian daily Al Ahram , however , says evidence has begun to appear indicating that these tiny cells may have put aside their doctrinal differences and joined forces for the single purpose of assassinating Mr. Sadat . There was clearly more than one plot against him in the last month of his life , and some of the conspirators appear to overlap organizations , the paper said. // The best known of these cells , and one to which Mr. Sadat ' s four assassins were linked , called itself simply the Moslem Group . The authorities , however , came to refer to it as Takfir Wahigra , or Repentence and Atonement , because its leaders commanded the faithful to " repent and flee from corrupt society " in preparation for a revolutionary takeover. // The group was founded in 1973 by Sahkir Ahmed Mustapha , a charismatic preacher who had been a member of the Moslem Brotherhood but grew impatient with its approach . According to Mr. Ibrahim , who has interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pyramid of tightly disciplined cells with a total membership of roughly 5 , 000 . <> <> Leaders Were Replaced // The five top leaders , including its founder , were hanged in November 1977 after their group murdered Sheik Muhammed al-Dhahabi , a former Minister of Religious Properties , whom it had kidnapped and hoped to trade for some of its imprisoned followers . Egyptian sources familiar with the group say it is run by the second echelon of leaders , who are also in prison but have little difficulty communicating with their members through sympathetic guards and other secret channels. // Most people here say it is impossible to determine how strong Takfir Wahigra or other militant groups are in the armed forces . But Western diplomatic sources say that the army is largely a cross section of the Egyptian population and generally reflects all of its political trends . Moreover , because upper-class Egyptians can bribe their way out of army service , the army tends to be weighted toward the lower middle-class people who make up the ranks of the militant Islamic organizations. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were produced in a certain environment : overcrowded cities with limited opportunities and great disparities of wealth where people felt their own identities were being swamped in wholesale process of Westernization and Americanization . As along as these conditions exist , so too will Moslem militancy. " //
