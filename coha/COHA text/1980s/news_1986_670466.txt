" 116 ! ! " // For that number to materialize , the Mets needed four more tense innings . When the Mets finally completed an 8-5 comeback victory to win the World Series from the Red Sox , they had their 116th triumph this year - 108 during the season , four in the National League Championship Series and now four in the World Series . During the 1981 and 1982 seasons , the Mets needed both of those years to win a total of only 106 games - 41 during the strike-interrupted 1981 schedule and 65 the next year as a last-place team. // " That ' s why this World Series is sweeter to me , " Keith Hernandez , the Mets ' first baseman , was saying now . " Sweeter than in 1982 when I was on the Cardinal team that won . The Mets were a last-place team when I came here in 1983 and now it ' s proved it ' s the best team in baseball. // That ' s also why this World Series is sweeter to all Mets fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed some horse sense after the final out . With dozens of mounted police guarding each foul line , nobody dared to gouge the grass for souvenirs , as thousands of rowdies had done following the clinching of the National League East title . Sometimes it takes animals to control animals. // This time the Mets had won the World Series the hard way - when they were expected to win it as baseball ' s best team . The only other time the Mets won the World Series was in 1969 when nobody expected that team to win , not even some of those Mets players . It ' s always easier that way . In the countdown to the final out , Frank Cashen , who constructed this Mets team and chose Davey Johnson as the manager , sat in the second row of the Mets ' club box on the press level . Wearing his bow tie and a gray sports jacket , he was hunched over , peering down as Hernandez batted with two runners on base in the bottom of the eighth with the Mets ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody asked Cashen. // " I ' m thinking I wish Yogi wasn ' t right , " he said. // Two innings earlier against Bruce Hurst , the Red Sox starter who was holding a 3-0 lead , Hernandez had lined a single to left center for the Mets ' first two runs. // " Money player , " Cashen was saying now. // Moments later Hernandez grounded out . Now the Mets needed only three outs . Jesse Orosco , their fourth pitcher , stared down at Eddie Romero , who had gone in at shortstop the previous inning . With a weak swing , Romero lifted a high pop foul near the first-base foul line where Hernandez , Orosco and Gary Carter converged. // " The Mex , the Mex , " yelled Cashen , using Hernandez ' s nickname . " Yeah , the Mex . " Two outs to go . Wade Boggs , the American League batting champion , dug in. // " Tough hitter , tough hitter , " Cashen said . " Good sound mechanical hitter. " // Strike one . Ball one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mets ' box , Al Harazin , their senior vice president , shook a fist . " Stay ahead of him , " Harazin said . " Hook him now , " Cashen yelled // Boggs bounced a grounder to Wally Backman , the second baseman . One out to go . Cashen and Fred Wilpon , the Mets ' chief executive officer , hurried to a nearby door leading to the Diamond Club where an elevator waited to take them downstairs . But as Marty Barrett , the Red Sox second baseman who had tied the World Series with a total of 13 hits , stepped in , a red smoke bomb exploded in left field. // " They ' re going to have to wait for it to clear , " Cashen said. // " It breaks his rhythm , " Wilpon said excitedly . " Breaks his rhythm. " // " There ' s so much irony in this Series , " Cashen said . " To think where California was in their series and where Boston was Saturday night . It seemed like the closer they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke had cleared . Strike one . Shredded paper fluttered down from the upper stands behind home plate. // " This is a game where both teams had great character , " Cashen said . " Both got down . Both came back . That ' s character . " On a 2-2 count , Barrett swung and missed . Cashen and Wilpon ran toward the waiting elevator where they shook hands and hugged. // " Great World Series , great for baseball , " Wilpon said. // " The hell with baseball , " Cashen said , smiling . Moments later , they were in the Mets ' locker room where televison cameras and crewmen waited . But the players had not yet arrived. // " C ' mon , get off the field , " Cashen yelled // Suddenly , the players were streaming into the clubhouse . In his excitement , Dwight Gooden hurried past Cashen , who hugged Sid Fernandez and then Bill Robinson , the batting coach . Soon the clubhouse was in chaos , a champagne chaos . To the side , Lenny Dykstra was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team , " the center fielder said. // Near his locker , Gary Carter was clutching the ball that Barrett had missed for the final out. // " I got this one , " the catcher shouted. // One by one , the players had snatched bottles of champagne out of the ice in two coolers . Corks popped like muffled gunfire . Some players were gulping it . Others were spraying it . Some were doing both . Soon some were chanting , " Let ' s go , Mets . " On a platform in front of television cameras , Cashen and Davey Johnson were accepting the World Series trophy from Commissioner Peter Ueberroth as champagne sprayed everywhere. // " Do you have a towel , " somebody asked , " for the Commissioner ? " // Moments later , Ray Knight , the Mets ' 33-year-old third baseman , was talking into a radio microphone about " how far I came from " to win the Series most valuable player award - from the thought during spring training that the Mets might release him , from a benching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne continued to squirt , Hernandez talked about " the turnaround for me , to come all the way back this year , " alluding perhaps to his brief delay in agreeing to pay a $190 , 000 fine and to do community service , as decreed by the Commissioner following the first baseman ' s acknowledgement of past drug-abuse. // Near the door , John McNamara suddenly appeared. // " Where ' s Davey ? " the Red Sox manager asked // " In his office , over there , " he was told. // In his gray uniform , the Red Sox manager walked in and shook hands with the Mets ' manager. // " Congratulations , " John McNamara said. // " Let ' s do it again , " Davey Johnson said. //
