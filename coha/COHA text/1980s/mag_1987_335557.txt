Postcard from California  --  Summer 1986 : <P> Dear Rolf : We heard about Chernobyl , and we certainly hope you and your family are all right . I 'm sure you 'll understand why we wo n't be dropping in to see you in Stockholm next month after all . With those crazy hijackers , airport bombers and high prices , we 're staying home this year . Besides , Europe may be exciting , but Yosemite in the moonlight can be pretty appealing too . <P> Postcard from Paris  --  Summer 1987 : <P> Dad , you would n't believe it ! There are Americans all over the place . We heard practically nothing but Midwestern accents at the Tower of London , and today , on the Champs-Elysees here in Paris , these neat French teenagers were walking around wearing badges that said I SPEAK ENGLISH.These people really love Americans ! <P> What a difference a year makes . In 1986 memories of brutal hijackings were painfully fresh , and the headlines were filled with reports of a radioactive cloud drifting westward over Europe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Libyan Dictator Muammar Gaddafi might take bloody revenge for the U.S. bombing of Tripoli on American tourists abroad . No wonder Americans looked closer to home for vacation spots . One year later , as fears about safety in Europe have faded , Americans are grabbing their passports , packing their guidebooks and crossing the Atlantic again in huge waves . Tour operators , airlines , hotels and travel ministries are reporting heavy bookings and bustling business from London to Lucerne . <P> At least 25% more Americans are expected to vacation in Western Europe this year than in 1986 , and the numbers may go much higher . During the first four months of this year , Lufthansa Airlines carried 32% more passengers from the U.S. to Europe than it did a year ago , and warm weather had yet to arrive on much of the Continent . Sales of American Express vacations in Europe are up 70% over last year , suggesting the possibility that 1987 may come close to matching the record travel year of 1985 , when 6.5 million Americans spent $6 billion on European travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss National Tourist Office : " Two months ago , we would have hardly dared to , predict such a spectacular turnaround . " <P> The upsurge is all the more remarkable in light of the 20% decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against an average of European currencies since early 1986 . That has made almost everything more expensive for an American in Europe . In Rome , for example , a double room for three nights at the King Hotel near the Spanish Steps that cost $246 last year now goes for $333 . A taxi ride from a hotel on London 's Hyde Park to the West End theater district , which cost about $4.50 two years ago , now runs closer to $5.75 . During the same period , dinner for two at a moderately priced restaurant in Paris has gone up from about $26 to $36 . <P> The slump of the once robust dollar has been offset in part by bargain air fares across the Atlantic . Roundtrip tickets to such destinations as Paris , London , Vienna and Frankfurt can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal roundtrip coach fares . The cheapest tickets , though , are often restricted to certain dates and advance purchase .
