A military coup brings an abrupt end to Nigeria 's democratic experiment <P> " Africa never ceases to amaze . " So wrote V.S. Naipaul in A Bend in the River , and last week , true to the novelist 's assessment , Africa amazed again . As recently as a fortnight ago , Nigerian President Alhaji Shehu Shagari , 58 , was being hailed as the enlightened leader of black Africa 's most populous and , in many ways , most promising democracy . Several days later , he was under detention in Lagos , while Major General Mohammed Buhari , 41 , organizer of a coup that deposed Shagari , was proclaiming to his countrymen that the armed forces had saved the nation from " total collapse . " <P> In a continent of nations still suffering 25 years later from the pains of birth and persistent poverty , Nigeria has a special significance . Its population , estimated at 90 million , is greater than that of any country in Western Europe . One of every five or six Africans is a Nigerian . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third largest supplier of petroleum to the U.S. ( after Mexico and Britain ) , Nigeria is the wealthiest nation in black Africa , with a gross national product that is more than half as large as that of the other black African nations combined . Unlike many other African countries , it has a sizable class of educated men and women who are well trained to run its government , industry and armed forces . And notwithstanding the occasional clampdowns imposed by the military , Nigeria has had a tradition of boisterous free speech , freewheeling politics and an unbridled press . <P> Thus the Dec. 31 coup that toppled Shagari dealt a blow to the hopes of a black Africa that had looked to Nigeria as a trail blazer for democratization . The fact that Shagari could not retain power , even though he was overwhehningly re-elected last August , highlighted the pattern of failure that has plagued black Africa in the quarter-century since most of its nations became independent . The problems of Nigeria are , by and large , those that afflict the entire continent : abject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncontrolled population growth . If , in spite of its assets , Nigeria can not break out of the vicious cycle of political instability and economic decline , the prospects for most of the continent 's other countries appear all the bleaker ( see following story ) . <P> After 13 years of military rule and a civil war that had taken at least 1 million lives , the nation known as the " African Giant " had in 1979 painstakingly embarked on its second attempt at democratic government , this time under a federal constitution closely modeled on that of the U.S. The mild-mannered Shagari , a Muslim from the north and a former schoolteacher , had been elected President and re-elected last August , winning 47% of the popular vote and at least 25% of the ballots in 16 of the country 's 19 states .
