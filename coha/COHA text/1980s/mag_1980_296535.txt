CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD by Mark Medoff <P> Silence may be golden , but one would never dream of saying that to the deaf . Yet Sarah ( Phyllis Frelich ) , the heroine of this play , who was born deaf , believes that silence is a magic realm of treasure in which her mind can richly imagine sounds . She is so stubborn in this belief that she has refused to learn how to lip-read or attempt to speak , although she is fluent in the use of sign language . At 26 , she works as a cleaning maid in a speech-therapy dorm , although tests indicate that she is capable of college work . <P> A last effort is made to help Sarah realize her potentialities . The challenge appeals to James ( John Rubinstein ) , an accomplished therapist who is witty , idealistic and amiably self-spoofing . Sparks fly between the two as they define their personalities and their pasts . The sparks become flames as they fall in love , make love and get married . All of this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rubinstein translating the signs into words . At times , this verges perilously close to charades , but for the most part the actors make it ardent , touching and frolicsome . <P> In Act II the characters and the play seem to fall apart . Almost arrogantly having refused help from James , Sarah joins a " cause " - putting deaf and hard-of-hearing people on the school staff . James complains that he wants to " rest his hands . " Finally , in an echo of A Doll 's House , Sarah resolves to be utterly her own woman until she can meet James again in some space that transcends silence and speech . <P> Rubinstein and Frelich do their best to make this plausible , and their ensemble work is wondrously skilled . So is the adept and imaginative direction of Gordon Davidson , at whose Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles this drama originated . Phyllis Frelich is actually deaf , and her presence on the stage of the Longacre Theater may be a Broadway first .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
