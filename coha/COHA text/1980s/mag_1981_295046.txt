A neighborhood faces doom and a new auto plant may rise <P> The sign above a brick archway in the basement of Immaculate Conception Church in the Poletown neighborhood of Detroit reads GM-MARK OF DESTRUCTION . It is a wry twist on the " mark of excellence " slogan of the General Motors Corp. , but none of the few dozen mostly elderly and Polish-American homeowners gathered in the room last week were laughing . Members of the Poletown Neighborhood Council , they are engaged in a battle to save their neighborhood as the city of Detroit prepares to raze some 1,500 private homes , schools and businesses in order to make way for GM 's new $500 million assembly plant . <P> The mood at the meeting was more upbeat than usual ; lawyers for the group had just filed suit in Federal District Court to block the plant . Helping the council in its fight is Ralph Nader , a longtime nemesis of GM , who was invited into the fray by area residents last year . Thus , by all appearances , the battle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens trying to preserve a way of life-which for many of them dates back to the turn of the century , when their immigrant ancestors arrived from Poland to make a new life for themselves in America . <P> But Poletown 's plight is , of course , not so simply put . When the GM plant is completed in 1983 , it will employ 6,000 workers in a city where unemployment is at 18% . It will also contribute an initial $8.1 million a year in tax revenues to Detroit and the enclosed city of Hamtramck , where only 15 months ago the huge Chrysler assembly plant known as Dodge Main was closed . The GM factory will also offer new hope to a decaying city that has hemorrhaged hundreds of thousands of jobs over the past decade and currently faces a record budget deficit of more than $135 million . Some 3,400 people will be forced to move to make way for the plant , but as the Detroit Free Press editorializes : " It 's a difficult call , but it is an essential step in rebuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began shaping up last June , when GM announced the closing of two outmoded Detroit plants that employed 6,000 people . At the same time , however , the company declared its intention to build a modern factory within the city limits if a suitable site could be found . Mayor Coleman Young lost no tune in taking GM up on its offer . After examining a dozen possible sites , the city finally decided to offer GM a 465-acre tract that not only included the shuttered Dodge Main plant but also swallowed up the surrounding 250 acres of Poletown . GM insisted that the new plant had to be built and in operation by early 1983 , so Young took advantage of a recent Michigan law allowing a city to acquire land for use by private enterprise . Detroit began a crash program of forcing home and business owners to sell their properties to the city .
