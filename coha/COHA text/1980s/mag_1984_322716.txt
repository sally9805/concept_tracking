Spying in the Donovan case <P> When Frank Silbey , chief investigator for the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee , was probing Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan 's alleged links with mobsters two years ago , he knew that he was also being investigated : in an unorthodox move that infuriated Capitol Hill , the New Jersey-based Schiavone Construction Co. , which is partly owned by Donovan , hired private detectives to find out who , according to Schiavone Lawyer Theodore Geiser , was " deliberately leaking information to the media . " <P> What Silbey probably did not realize was that many of his conversations were being secretly recorded by Ralph Sharer , a freelance sleuth paid by Schiavone . Sharer , a former Government auditor , says he spied on Silbey and other staffers for more than two months in 1982 . " I taped Silbey every time I talked to him , " he claims . During that period , Sharer was working with the committee on two investigations unrelated to the Donovan case , a role that permitted him to act as a mole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Schiavone , the chairman of the construction firm , who met with the detective in a Washington hotel bar and asked him to find out everything about the Senators and staffers investigating Donovan . " He wanted it all , " says Sharer . " Marriages , divorces , girlfriends , sex-whatever we could dig up . Schiavone was angry . He felt he was being unfairly maligned and slandered . " Sharer claims Schiavone once produced a large bundle of $100 bills as a down payment on the job . In all , Sharer says , he spent 260 " billable hours " working for Schiavone at $250 an hour , services worth a total of $65,000 . <P> Sharer used a mike concealed in a briefcase or under his clothing to record conversations in the Senate office , including Silbey 's words when he was on the phone with reporters . Sharer claims there were other moles in the committee 's midst : three Republican staffers routinely passed confidential FBI reports and committee memos to Schiavone detectives . Sharer recalls one of them saying , " Ralph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME has learned that Special Prosecutor Leon Silverman , who headed the Donovan inquiry in 1982 , was on the Schiavone spies ' list of targets . Silverman said last week that he was " appalled " to hear Schiavone 's agents had designated him for investigation and that he considered such actions to be " perilously close to obstructing justice . " Sharer says Schiavone boasted of getting material from Silverman 's staff . Schiavone Lawyer Geiser denies that the company received leaks from that office .
