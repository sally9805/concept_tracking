Torn between their native culture and that of the surrounding American society , Indian reservations have often been visited by despair and violence . The Native American suicide rate is far above the national average , but even that depressing fact could not account for the events of the past two months at the Wind River Reservation ( pop . 6,000 ) in Wyoming , where nine young tribesmen have taken their lives . That rate is some 24 times the average for Indian men ages 15 to 24 , and 60 times the national figure . Last week tribal elders returned to a long-abandoned tradition in the hope of saving their children . TIME Correspondent Dan Goodgame reports from Wind River : <P> They looked like kids on a high school field trip , clad in Levi 's and Springsteen sweatshirts , lining up by the hundreds at the entrance to a tepee . These students , though , were Indians , and the healing ritual to which they were invited was solemnly dedicated to saving their lives . <P> Inside the tepee , redolent of burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cleanse them of evil spirits . This was " big medicine , " last invoked during the killing flu epidemic of 1918 and now revived to banish the modern-day evil that has lately infected Wind River . <P> The nine recent suicides admit to no pattern , except that all the victims were young men and all died by hanging . They ranged in age from 14 to 25 . Friends and relatives saw no warning signs among most of the victims , and no explanation could be found in the two notes left behind : one youth simply willed his stereo to his brother . <P> The rash of suicides began Aug. 12 , when a 19-year-old Indian , in jail for public drunkenness , hanged himself with socks taken from a sleeping cellmate . A 16-year-old pallbearer at his funeral became the second victim , using a pair of sweatpants to hang himself from a tree . In turn , one of that youth 's mourners became the third victim . Says Fremont County Coroner Larry Lee : " It seems to be a copycat , domino kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found no evidence of a suicide pact . He believes that alcohol or drugs were factors in fewer than half the cases . " Many parents of these kids are friends of mine , and we ca n't explain it , " he says . " These kids have n't even lived yet , and they 're killing themselves . " <P> Some tribespeople view the suicide epidemic as a reason to re-examine the reservation 's social and economic ills . About 70% of the Wind River work force is unemployed , and jobs for the young are especially scarce . At the same time , the reservation 's oil and gas wealth provides royalty payments of up to $300 a month per person , thus fostering a debilitating welfare culture . Howard Smith , fiscal officer for the Arapaho tribe , which shares the 2 million-acre reservation with the Shoshones , says , " Too many of our young people have time on their hands , so they drink and watch TV and get depressed .
