What Sister Geraldine would have visitors understand is that it is not a matter of how much she gives to the people of Sunset Park but how much she gets back . The gift is their lives , she says : they trust us with their lives , and we offer them in return practical things like food and clothing , spiritual things like comfort and encouragement , hope , perhaps ; sometimes we give them hope . But oh , what they give to us . Sister Mary Paul actually cried last night to realize how lucky the two of us are to be here . Do n't think for a moment that these people are characterized by their poverty . They are wonderful people , wonderful . Maria . Tony and Ingrid . Rose and her six kids living in a car . Even Mallory . Yes , Mallory too , though I know you wo n't think so . Sure I love them . I 'm supposed to love them as part of my vocation . But you ca n't love someone into life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous . Sunset Park goes on and on . The work we do , it 's not like your kind of work , not like most kinds of work , with beginnings , endings and neat hard lines . It 's not like a story . <P> I MALLORY <P> The darkness has two colors : purple and gray . They float toward each other like ghosts in the hallway of Mallory 's basement apartment . The darkness is absolute . Not even the walls are visible , until the door to the kitchen is pushed open and the apartment is cast in a cold silver , late afternoon light admitted through a single kitchen window . Three chairs surround a formica $ table standing flush against a wall . The seats of the chairs are torn open , exposing a brown stuffing . Beside one of the kitchen chairs a gas pipe juts straight up three feet where an oven used to be . Mallory explains he has no use for an oven ; the hot plate on the sink is more than adequate for Michael and him . Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pulled out , leaving holes . In an aluminum pie plate on the table , cigarette ashes mix with the remains of a crust . The ceiling is water-stained around a circular fluorescent bulb . The walls are yellow , sallow in the darkening room . <P> " Why do n't you turn on the lights , Mr. Mallory ? " <P> " Saves money . " He touches a finger to his forehead to indicate shrewdness . His small dark eyes look both cold and imploring . <P> " Where does Michael do his homework ? " <P> " Here , at the kitchen table . I turn on the lights at night . Do n't need ' em in the day . Do n't need heat , either . You feel warm enough , do n't you ? " <P> Mallory 's apartment has four rooms , but he rents out the front room to a Puerto Rican mother and two children . If that family wants to use the kitchen , or the bathroom at the far end of the kitchen , they must ask Mallory 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign : DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF . Of the two other rooms , one belongs to Michael and Michael 's mother Eileen . The other is Mallory 's bedroom , nearly filled by a low queen-size bed with an upholstered maroon headboard into which a clock radio has been fitted . Above the headboard on a yellow wall hangs a huge novelty $1,000 bill , with Mallory 's face where Grover Cleveland 's would be . Beside the bed is a phone with a lock on the dial . " They want to use it , " says Mallory , " they have to pay . "
