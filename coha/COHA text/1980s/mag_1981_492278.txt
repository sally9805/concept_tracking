IMES GARNER : A SOF ' HEARTED MAVERICK n the little rural com- community of Cushing , Texas , a crowd has gathered on a side street . Rumor has it that Warner Brothers is filming an NBC movie of the week right here in town  --  and the town has come out to watch , hoping to catch a glimpse , however fleeting , of " the Star . " " There he is ! " someone hisses , pointing , and all eyes turn . There he is indeed . James Garner  --  tall , rangy , dangerously handsome  --  approaches the group . He wades in warily , his dark , somber eyes roaming the sea of faces . Dealing with crowds , though not exactly Garner 's strong suit , has long since become an inescapable way of life . He submits to endless picture taking and hastily scrawls his name on the dozens of scraps of paper thrust at him , walking backward all the while , like a man bent on escape . On the fringe , an elderly woman stands alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garner spots her and softens perceptibly . Taking her by the arm , he leads her over to his own chair on the set . " There you go , honey , " he drawls . " You 've got the best seat in the house . " Little things like that can earn a man a reputation as a good guy  --  in a hurry . But then , at 53 , Garner has been known as a good guy for a lot of years . ( He 's also been known as outspoken and opinionated , a man who sticks up for his beliefs , even when he 's dead wrong . ) To the American viewing public , he is " the kind of person you 'd really like to know , " perhaps because the characters he chooses to play tend to fall down a lot , stub their toes and sometimes have difficulty paying their bills . His friends call him a big kidder , a man who ca n't resist a " setup . " And his coworkers , without exception , insist he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe what they 're all trying to say is simply that he is very human . Garner , though a little embarrassed by all the praise , ca n't very well deny the human part . Whether or not he 's any more human than most is a point he might argue . " We 're all put here on earth together , " Garner protests . " We 've got to try to live together . " It is several days later . The movie company has been moved from location in Cushing to Maydelle , an even tinier town some 45 miles away . This particular production , entitled Hangin ' On ( costarring Joan Hackett ) , is a pet project of Garner 's . " I 've carried the script around for ten years , " he explains , " because I liked the feelings  --  the relationships  --  of the people in it . " The story , set in Oklahoma ( Garner 's native state ) back in the ' 50s , is all about a simpler time in American life . Maybe not easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam train , and folks were concerned for their jobs . But simpler . " I remember , " Garner recalls , " when you could go anywhere you wanted to and not be afraid , and you did n't have to lock your doors at night . " This is , I quickly discover , a frequently recurring theme during our conversation ; concern for the direction life seems to be taking these days and a very real yearning to bring things back to some semblance of order . Garner is resting between scenes in his motor home/dressing room/refreshment center . Munching cookies and downing coffee from a heavy mug , he is stretched out on a couch obviously designed for a much smaller man . From time to time he fiddles with an ice pack perched precariously on his right knee . ( Garner is recovering from knee surgery  --  again . He has a strange way of doing it . Out of the hospital less than a month , he has already been back at work for three weeks . ) He shifts his massive frame in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview ranks somewhere between having a tooth extracted and suffering through a really mean sinus infection . " I just do n't see why anybody would be interested in anything I have to say , " he protests . " I 'm just an actor . There must be 25,000 of them somewhere . " Just an actor ? Certainly . But few actors have achieved the phenom enal success enjoyed by this publicity-shy Oklahoman . Nor are many so well loved . Garner has , with ease , traversed the supposedly inviolable line between television and the silver screen and has met with unqualified acceptance on both sides . Theatergoers loved him in Support Your Local Sheriff , The Americanization of Emily , Grand Prix and more than two dozen other films . Their ardor was not diminished when they sat home and watched his tongue-in-cheek performances as " Maverick , " " Nichols " and , most recently , " Rockford . " Even doing commercials  --  often considered poison to an actor 's career  --  has n't done him in . When " The Rockford Files " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were audible sighs all over . A lot of these may have been from former NBC President Fred Silverman , who found himself in the painful position of being obliged to give up the golden goose . Some of them were from the show 's title figure , but these were sighs of relief . " I just physically ran out of gas and had to take a rest , " he declares . " By the time I was anywhere near able to go back to work , the series had been cancelled , because we did n't meet our air dates . " But the loudest and longest sighs of all came from genuine , dyed-in-the-wool Garner fans , who consoled themselves with the thought that at least they could still see him on the Polaroid ads . As it turns out , however , there is no need to cluster around the tube at commercial time this season . We can just tune in NBC and enjoy . The new Garner vehicle is , well , an old Garner vehicle , the one that catapulted him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bret Maverick is back  --  a little older , a little wiser , but just as full of vinegar as ever . Why did Garner decide to launch a new " Maverick " series ? And why now ? Garner shrugs and grabs for another cookie . " What am I gon na do ? " he grins . " Go out in space ? Do a little fantasy ? Besides , I think it 'll be fun to // come back and do this after the time lapse . As long as the writing 's good , it does n't matter what the format is . And the scripts I 've read for the new series are better than the ones we had for the original . " ( Garner is both producing and starring in the show . ) " There has n't been a successful western series on TV for a long time . For one thing , they 're too expensive to make . For another , the public got burned out on them for a while . But I think it 's time to bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Garner is a joker . His motto on the set , they say , is " We will work hard and laugh . " And laugh they do  --  at themselves and at each other . The humor carries over into the finished product . Their laughter is shared with the world . But the Garner I am seeing now is not joking . He has fallen silent , eyes brooding . As essential as humor is to him , there is an added factor that he feels compelled to make an integral part of the new series  --  a sense of what was and is no more . " I think , " he says , speaking slowly , because the words are a little heavy , " that in the ' 80s , people are wanting to get back to something they 've lost . They 're going back to the earth . Back to born-again Christianity . Back to basics . Things have gotten a little too hot and heavy , and people do n't know how to handle it . So they want to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code in the West that people do n't even understand anymore . A way of dealing with their fellow men . A code of right and wrong . " He pauses , qualifies . " Not that there were n't a lot of people doing wrong . But there was a code . There was , " he finishes simply , " honesty . " That word " honesty " is vital to Garner . It 's what he looks for , first and foremost , he declares , in the people around him . The lack of it is the one thing that turns him off . " Just lie to me once , " he warns , then qualifies again , drawing his words out like a gruff but indulgent father . " We11-1I-11 , I might let you get away with it once , but the second time , you 're in a lotta trouble . " Asked what he considers his own greatest strength , he does n't hesitate to reply , very matter-of-factly , " my honesty . " But when he is asked about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " Lyin ' about my honesty , " he announces cheerfully , giving me a **35;4234;TOOLONG look . Then he laughs ( a good old , deep down sort of laugh ) and says he loves it and allows as how that was the perfect setup . When it 's hard to get a straight answer from Garner , one can always go to his friends . Like most close-knit families , the Garner people are protective of their privacy . But when they do offer an answer , it is usually straight . " Picking up strays " is his weakness , they inform me flatly , referring to Garner 's penchant for helping out the underdog . " He 's too kindhearted for his own good . " Garner considers the allegation , turning it over quietly in his mind for a moment . " Yeah , I guess so , " he admits finally . " Everybody seems to think I 'm a pigeon in that area , but I do n't think so . I 've had a few broken wings in my day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pick me up and dust me off . " They did , too , he remembers . " Oh , you bet ! There were a lot of ' ern along the way . And I believe in paying those things off . That 's why I maybe pick up a lot of strays and try to help people . Some of them I do n't even know . Some of them I guess take advantage of it . I do n't know , and I do n't really care . I feel they need it at the time , so I do it . " Not one to talk much about private pain , Garner nevertheless finds it near impossible to stand idly by and watch someone else in pain or being mistreated . That was never more apparent than when he participated in the 1963 civil rights march in Washington , D.C. One of the West Coast organizers , he says he ca n't recall whether he got any flack from it  --  and is n't worried about it . " I really just try to get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy , when somebody starts treadin ' on other people  --  those who ca n't defend themselves  --  I 'm gon na get right in there and do somethin ' . I might get stomped on , but that 's all right , too . " If I could wish for just one miracle , I 'd wish for peace . Not for me . For the world . Because if everybody had it , I 'm one of ' em , and I 'd have it , too . I do n't believe you could ask for any more than that . " Continued on page 112 Miracles , however , can be a long time coming . And life goes on . For James Garner , it seems , life and work are one and the same thing . " I 'm gon na be busy , " he admits , when brought back to the subject of career . " As soon as I get through with this picture , I have to go to London and finish up one called Victor Victoria ( a comedy directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alex Karras ) . Then I come back and engage in work on the ' Maverick ' series . ' ' He sighs . " After that , I 'm gon na need a long rest . " What does Garner do when he gets a rest ? " I do n't know ! " he complains . " I have n't had one ! When I do get some time off , I do n't know what to do with it , and that bothers me  --  not knowing how to occupy my time . I used to race , but I 'm getting too old for that . I 'm slowing down . I do n't have the drive anymore. - He laughs at the pun . " Anyway , I do n't know what I 'll do when I get some time off . Probably just lie down . That sounds good . " One thing Garner does do when he is off is to get away . Away from crowds , away from fans , away from phones . " I used to go to Baja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fish . But nowadays , I just move a lot . About the time everybody finds out where I am , I just move somewhere else . " When he is at work , however , which is most of the time , he can not very well avoid constant contact with people . So he has done the next best thing . He has surrounded himself with people he likes very much , people whose work he respects . People like Meta Rosenberg , his executive producer , whom he describes as " one of the most talented people I 've ever met . She can look at a script and tell me if it 's any good and whether it can be fixed and who can fix it . " And Jack Casey , the Warner Brothers PR man . " You want an interview , you go through Casey . " And Luis Delgado , whose friendship dates back further than does the career . And , of course , there is Stuart Margolin ( Angel from " Rockford " ) . Garner and Margolin met back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked each other immediately and have worked together as much as possible ever since . " I 've said a lot of times , " Garner explains , " that if I had to work everyday for the rest of my life with one actor , it would be Stu . He gives so much to his work  --  and he brings so much out of me . He works with such intensity and is so involved that it rubs off . " Margolin appears as a continuing character , Filo Bodine , in the new " Maverick " series . Filo is a Yugoslav scout/hunter who thinks he 's an Indian and rides a donkey . ( Margolin comments sagely that he 'd like for Filo to use an English saddle " with a little doughnut for hemorrhoids . " ) It is time for Garner to do his next scene . He stretches and flexes his legs , wincing a little . " If some group of archeologists digs up my bones 2,000 years from now , " he observes wryly , " they 'll wonder what in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relishing the thought . Little sun-wizened men , wearing khaki suits and glasses , examining their find  --  leg bones that will bend and straighten just so far . Maybe they will think they have found the missing link . A fitting legacy for the man who has said he only wants to be remembered with a smile . The final , perfect setup . " Yeah-h-h , " he muses aloud . " I reckon that 'll give ' em somethin ' to think about . " IV
