The Senate candidates in Florida have such similar views on the issues that voters are left with mostly a choice between personalities . Similarly , in Indiana the Senate contest revolves around the question How many years in Washington are too many ? Among House incumbents , a liberal Democrat has run into trouble in Texas , and a conservative Republican is being hard-pressed in California . <P> Consumer Report in Florida <P> The Democrat is a man , the Republican is a woman , but there ends the major difference between the contestants for the Florida Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Richard Stone . William Gunter , 46 , who sank Stone in a primary runoff , has been a strong consumer advocate as state insurance commissioner since 1976 . He ordered auto insurance companies to cut their premiums by more than $125 million . Republican Nominee Paula Hawkins , 53 , earned a similar reputation as a member of the state 's public service commission from 1972 to 1978 by voting against utility rate increases . <P> The two also resemble each other in personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the commission , Hawkins was a tart-tongued , self-styled " fighter , " though she preferred to describe herself as a " Maitland housewife . " But as accustomed as they are to a good scrap , the two candidates have so far kept the gloves on . Both tirelessly remind voters of their records and promise to focus on pocketbook issues in the Senate . Standing in a drizzle in downtown St. Petersburg last week , Gunter told an elderly crowd that he would fight for improvements in Medicare and for banning all mandatory retirement . The next day , Hawkins , campaigning in brilliant sunshine in Port Saint Joe , promised to seek a Senate investigation to determine whether , as she suspects , the U.S. has sufficient oil reserves for the next 300 years . <P> They attack each other only indirectly . Gunter has depicted himself as " someone with experience in public office , " a thinly veiled reference to Hawkins ' lack of legislative experience ( Gunter served as a Congressman from 1973 to 1975 ) . Hawkins tells audiences that " I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsubtle dig at Gunter for accepting donations from insurance agents ( Gunter says he limits them to $100 each ) . Though Gunter expects to raise more money than Hawkins ( $1.5 million vs. $1 million ) , she will have outspent him , $500,000 to $350,000 , on radio and TV spots during the final weeks of the campaign . <P> The candidates are running even , with the outcome probably hinging on the retired , mostly Jewish voters in the condominiums of Miami and the rest of southern Florida . In a state that has elected only one Republican to the Senate in this century , Hawkins must persuade these traditional Democrats that she is the better bargain . <P> Memories in Indiana
