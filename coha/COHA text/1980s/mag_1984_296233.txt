Congress sputters toward an undistinguished adjournment <P> The federal calendar set one deadline : the Government began a new fiscal year last Monday and needed fresh authority from Congress to continue spending money . The legislators had fixed a second deadline : they agreed to strive for adjournment Thursday so that they could go home and campaign full-time for reelection . Religion posed a third deadline : Congress decided not to legislate past sundown Friday , the beginning of Yom Kippur , in deference to its Jewish members . <P> So what did Congress do ? Miss all three deadlines , naturally . On Monday , it renewed Government spending authority for three days ; on Thursday , it renewed the renewal until 6 p.m . Friday . But House and Senate conferees could not agree by then on the provisions of a catch-all $460 billion " continuing resolution " to fund the Government for a whole year . So Congress gave itself another extension until Tuesday of this week , when the legislators will have to return to deal with the measure . Barring a presidential veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress will then pass into history , leaving a two-year record that might charitably be called undistinguished . <P> That would be far too mild an adjective to describe the near anarchy last week . Important legislation , notably on immigration and civil rights , appeared doomed . Other significant bills whistled through with minimal consideration ; the House passed a far-reaching package of anticrime measures after ten minutes of debate . <P> Long hours ( all night in the Senate Wednesday ) , obstructionist tactics and partisan maneuvering caused many tempers to snap . " Shame on the Senate ! Shame on the Senate ! " cried Massachusetts Democrat Ted Kennedy after the upper chamber dropped the civil rights bill . Barry Goldwater stormed that because of haggling over the catch-all spending bill , Senators collectively were " beginning to look like jackasses " ; his Republican colleague , Wyoming 's Malcolm Wallop , wondered why the Arizonan had only said " beginning . " In the House , Democrat James Jones embarrassed the G.O.P. by introducing a plan requiring Presidents to submit each year a budget proposal that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might consider more realistic . " Phony ! " shouted Robert Walker of Pennsylvania . <P> " A sham , " said Tom Loeffler of Texas . <P> Then both Republicans voted for the measure , and it passed . The Senate ignored it . <P> When all the shouting was over , Congress would wind up doping little more than it absolutely could not avoid . In an era when monster deficits and the politically unpopular steps that might reduce them seem about equally intolerable to many legislators , Congress 's budget-making process has broken down completely . As has become its deplorable habit , the legislature came to the end of a fiscal year with the great majority of appropriations bills-nine of 13 in this case-unpassed . Once again , Congress had to bundle money for defense expenditures , most social spending and even some routine housekeeping chores into a gargantuan continuing resolution . <P> In the meantime , Congress passed stopgap measures to keep the Government running for a few days or hours .               @ @ @ @ @ @
