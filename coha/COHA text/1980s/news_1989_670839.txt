Like a Broadway show enduring a course of extended previews , Agassi spent this spring and summer refining his act to get it right for opening night at the United States Open , an engagement where he hopes to be onstage for the full two-week run. // Last year , Agassi came into the tournament seeded fourth , with a match record of 53-7 , and was , by his own admission , blithely " riding the crest of a wave . " This year , with a match record of 28-14 and earnings of $225 , 506 , he is seeded sixth , one spot ahead of his fellow phenomenon Michael Chang , and is eager to transcend his small-scale sophomore slump. // " There ' s no comparison between my confidence and motivation levels now and what they were at the start of the year , " said Agassi , who attributed his 1989 jitters to a combination of complications , including his insecurity about reprising 1988 and a switch in racquets . " Back in January , I was worried about living up to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m playing against my opponents . I feel stronger , and I feel I ' m making progress. " // This spring , with the player ' s blessing , his coach , Nick Bollettieri , went about the business of hastening Agassi ' s physical transformation from boy to man . Pat Etcheberry , a former javelin thrower for Chile , was commissioned as Agassi ' s first official trainer , and while his peers clashed at Wimbledon , Agassi toiled on the training field in pursuit of a body that would stand up to the rigors of a five-set United States Open match. // " He had never lifted weights , never done any running , " Etcheberry said . " But he felt a need for more strength , more endurance , because he could see in five set matches that he was running out of gas after a few sets. " // After skipping Wimbledon , a Grand Slam tournament that holds less allure for him than does the Open , Agassi went to West Germany with the United States Davis Cup team , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb back to respectability , and fell just short of defeating Boris Becker in five ferocious sets. // He took that match as a good omen , as he did his loss to Ivan Lendl in their hotly contested Canadian Open semifinal 10 days ago . Intent on improving his volleying , Agassi asked Lendl to be his doubles partner at the Open . Although Lendl refused to play anything but singles here , the two will pair up at a tournament this fall. // This time around , putting on a good show at the Open has taken on such significance for Agassi that he refuses to talk about it. // " It is the most important tournament for him , " said Agassi ' s older brother , Philip , a former satellite-circuit player who is Andre ' s full-time traveling companion and adviser and occasional vocal surrogate . " I think Andre would trade 10 tournament wins for one Open. " // Force-fed a diet of tennis from the moment he looked up from his crib and saw a tennis ball-and-racquet mobile designed by his father , Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been predetermined. // " Andre wouldn ' t be where he is today if it wasn ' t for Dad , " said Philip , who admits the Agassi boys were raised on a merciless philosophy when it came to competition . Mike Agassi , an Olympic boxer for Iran in 1948 and 1952 , could never tolerate defeat and as recently as three years ago still sought out grudge matches for Andre. // " When you ' re a fighter and you lose a fight , you not only lost the fight , you got beat up , and I think he carried that over into tennis , " Philip said . " But he ' s laid off a lot in the past couple years. " // Agassi ' s success has appeased his father , and lately Andre has turned his attention to making sure he feels good about himself . He has struggled with harsh assessments of everything from his talent , tantrums and unorthodox on-court jesting to his hairdo and his revived Christianity. // John McEnroe has chided him about clapping for his opponents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less like Liberace . McEnroe has called Agassi ' s on court theatrics " insulting , " and Mark Woodforde of Australia said that every Agassi defeat was like a coup for those who practice sportsmanship. // Jimmy Connors , incensed by Agassi ' s public prediction of an easy victory in their 1988 United States Open quarterfinal , said then : " He just made a bad mistake , not just with me but with the other players . If he comes in and starts predicting , that can make a lot of guys feel strange toward you. " // And the same reporters that got such a kick out of him in 1988 seemed inclined to kick him around in 1989 . At one point , Philip Agassi said , Andre believed the press was conspiring against him. // " The feeling he expressed to me , " Philip said , " was , ' What are people trying to do to me , the press ? They ' re the ones that called me the savior of American tennis . I get to No. 3 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take out their axes and their chain saws and just try to cut me down . Is this all worth it ? ' " // This year , without a finals victory in 11 tournament starts , Agassi is hopeful that he can reinvent himself at the Open , where he took an ingenue ' s leap to the semifinals last year after six tournament victories. // But what was a showcase in 1988 , this year looms more like a gauntlet , a proving ground where Agassi , a certified heartthrob but not yet a certified champion , will get another chance to make good on his father ' s lifetime ambition. // " He came so far so fast last year , " said Bollettieri , who took over Agassi ' s tennis education six years ago at the behest of Mike Agassi. // " He wasn ' t in a hurry , it just happened , " added Bollettieri , who has been accused of rushing prodigies like Jimmy Arias and Aaron Krickstein into the limelight before they were prepared to weather it. // " Last year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so well , but that ' s difficult to maintain when you ' re not yet developed as a man . Andre knows his rank won ' t be No. 3 at the end of this year , and that it shouldn ' t be . Physically , he ' s 12 to 18 months away. " // In 1988 , Agassi used his racquet , a reliable pre-phenomenon Prince , like a jackhammer and power-blasted his way through the competition . He seemed the obvious heir to Connors and McEnroe , the weapon likeliest to provide the United States with a champion for the coming decade , an antidote to the young Swedes and West Germans stalking the tennis pinnacle. // In 1989 , he negotiated a $6 million racquet contract from Donnay International that outstripped that of any other tennis professional , proof of his lightning grasp of fame and fortune . The trouble was , it took Agassi a good six months to learn to trust his new racquet , and that period of estrangement from the tool of his trade turned into a metaphor for everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trusted in his life. // " It ' s not as easy as last year when I had nothing on my mind , " he said last week in a telephone interview from Princeton , N.J. , where on Saturday , in the semifinals of an exhibition tournament , he lost to Goran Ivanisevic , 6-4 , 6-1 . " Things start getting negative when you give other people control of your emotions. " // Two years ago Agassi stormed off the court after a loss in Washington , and , already master of the grand gesture , went into a nearby park and gave away all his racquets . Bollettieri wooed him back with the promise that he ' d one day be a champion and in the meantime would be loved whether he won or lost. // Since then , the Agassi retinue , consisting of Philip , Bollettieri , and Bill Shelton , Agassi ' s agent from the International Management Group , has been on call to act as a buffer , and there ' s been no further talk of quitting. // Last year Agassi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won six tournaments , escalated his ranking to third , up 88 notches from where it was when he turned professional in 1986 , and became a millionaire from two sources , his tournament earnings and a profusion of endorsements. // The slender teen-ager from Las Vegas let his two-tone hairdo , two-fisted grip , and too-blue denim shorts carry him all the way to the semifinals of the Open before Lendl grimly pulled the plug on the bandwagon. // Lendl accused Agassi of overacting throughout their four-set match and of " giving up " in its middle sets , and he has questioned both Agassi ' s resolve and his sportsmanship . Lendl has noticed improved determination recently , but still isn ' t convinced of Agassi ' s fighting spirit. // " When I played him in Montreal last week , " Lendl said , " I was really beating on him and he didn ' t give up . But I have seen him in other matches - the Davis Cup , French Open - he wasn ' t fighting all that well. " // Everybody , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend his top-10 ranking . But if even Lendl has consented to share the court with him at some future date , Agassi wants to assume that sooner or later the rest of the skeptics can be convinced to warm up to him , too. // " His ambition is to be out there on the court and be totally happy , " Philip Agassi said . " Andre knows this is a plastic world. " //
