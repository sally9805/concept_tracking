While serving as Jimmy Carter 's special Middle East ambassador in 1979-80 , Sol Linowitz spent countless hours trying to fathom the complex personality of Menachem Begin . As President Reagan prepared to confront Begin on the invasion of Lebanon , TIME asked Linowitz for his views on dealing with the Israeli Prime Minister : <P> Begin is a man of many moods , with a wide swing of emotions . He can be very gentle , quiet , sentimental . Yet he can also act like a thundering prophet out of the Old Testament . He is a man who walks in his own history . His family was wiped out in the Holocaust , and that hangs over everything he thinks about . <P> Nothing bewilders him more than to get conflicting signals . Time and again we have assured him of our commitment to Israel 's security . Then he hears that we are planning to supply AWACS airborne warning and control systems to Saudi Arabia and arms to Jordan . He does not know how to relate this to what he thinks is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a lawyer and proud of it . He is very careful about every word , so precise about every nuance of the language . You have to be as careful as he is . He has a fantastic memory , so he remembers what you have said . <P> I believe Begin prides himself on being a man of his word , on doing what he says he is going to do . He takes very badly the allegation that he does not abide by his commitments . That is important in understanding Begin as a proud leader who speaks with great determination , with the feeling that he knows the right course for the future and that he is trying to find peace in the midst of warlike neighbors . <P> A hardline , get-tough attitude is not the way to move Begin . He will become even more adamant about his assertions if he feels that threats are being used and pressure applied in order to get him to give way . If we take that approach , he may become more intractable , and , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a passion . <P> Begin believes in telling us bluntly what he expects of us , so it is vitally important that we level with him if we are going to deal with him effectively . We do n't do that . We skirt that kind of directness . We go through curious steps , such as suggesting that the President will not meet with him because we are dissatisfied about what he may be doing in Beirut . There is the perception on his part that we lack forthrightness in dealing with him .
