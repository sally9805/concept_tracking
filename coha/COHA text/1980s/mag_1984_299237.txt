When journalists hear journalists claim a " larger truth , " they really ought to go for their pistols . The New Yorker 's Alastair Reid said the holy words last week : " A reporter might take liberties with the factual circumstances to make the larger truth clear . " O large , large truth . Apparently Mr. Reid believes that imposing a truth is the same as arriving at one . Illogically , he also seems to think that truths may be disclosed through lies . But his error is more fundamental still in assuming that large truth is the province of journalism in the first place . The business of journalism is to present facts accurately-Mr . Reid notwithstanding . Those seeking something larger are advised to look elsewhere . <P> For one thing , journalism rarely sees the larger truth of a story because reporters are usually chasing quite small elements of information . A story , like a fern , only reveals its final shocking shape in stages . Journalism also reduces most of the stories it deals with to political considerations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who opposes whom or what , where the special interests are . As a result , the larger truth of a story is often missed or ignored . By its nature , political thought limits speculative thought . Political realities themselves can not be grasped by an exclusively political way of looking at things . <P> Then , too , journalism necessarily deals with discontinuities . One has never heard of the Falkland Islands . Suddenly the Falklands are the center of the universe ; one knows all there is to know about " kelpers " and Port Stanley ; sheep jokes abound . In the end , as at the beginning , no one really knows anything about the Falkland Islands other than the war that gave it momentary celebrity-nothing about the people in the aftermath of the war , their concerns , isolation , or their true relationship to Argentina and Britain . Discontinuities are valuable because they point up the world 's variety as well as the special force of its isolated parts . But to rely on them for truth is to lose one 's grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the ball is , and not where it is not . A college basketball coach , trying to improve the performance of one of his backcourt men , asked the player what he did when he practiced on his own . " Dribble and shoot , " came the reply . The coach then asked the player to add up the total time he dribbled and shot during a scrimmage game , how many minutes he had hold of the ball . " Three minutes in all , " came the reply . " That means , " said the coach , " that you practice what you do in three minutes out of 40 in a game . " Which means in turn that for every player , roughly 37 out of a possible 40 minutes are played away from the ball . <P> Journalism tends to focus on the poor when the poor make news , usually dramatic news like a tenement fire or a march on Washington . But the poor are poor all the time . It is not journalism 's ordinary business to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something shapely and elegant . Poverty is disorderly , anticlimactic and endless . If one wants truth about the poor , one must look where the ball is not .
