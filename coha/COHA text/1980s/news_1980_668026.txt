George Meany , the gruff-talking plumber who rose to become the single most powerful force in the American labor movement , died yesterday . He was 85 . Meany stepped down in November after 25 years as the only president the AFL-CIO had known . Meany , who had been confined to a wheelchair since last May , was readmitted to George Washington Hospital on Sunday for treatment of a painful buildup of fluid in his legs . AFL-CIO spokesman Albert Zack said Meany ' s condition had worsened yesterday afternoon when he suffered a sudden drop in blood pressure and he was transferred to the hospital ' s intensive care unit . He died at 9:55 p.m. , Zack said . Death was attributed to cardiac arrest . Told of Meany ' s death , Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , said , " George Meany was my friend and a giant for American labor . He was a great American and all of us will miss him . " Meany ' s health had deteriorated rapidly in 1979 , perhaps hastened by the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of the woman to whom he had been married for 59 years dampened his spirit and his determination to recover . Shortly after her death , he suffered a knee injury that prompted a flare- up of his arthritic hip . He was left gaunt , pale and confined to a wheelchair . It was from that wheelchair that Meany bade a tearful farewell to the 14 million-labor federation in November at the AFL-CIO ' s annual convention . Meany was " Mr. Labor , " keeping an iron grip on the organization he forged by bringing together the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1955 . Under Democratic and Republican Presidents alike , he became as much a political power broker as a labor leader . And he could never be taken for granted . Although he led the AFL-CIO to a strong endorsement of Jimmy Carter during Carter ' s campaign against Gerald R. Ford in 1976 , Meany soon emerged as one of the new President ' s most persistent and harshest critics . Meany was succeeded as head of the AFL-CIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meany ' s final speech in November had been delivered in the same Bronx- accented voice and with the same stern grimmace that were his trademarks . Although unemotional until the very end of the speech , he finally could not restrain the tears . Twice his voice choked , and with difficulty , he told the convention : " To God go my prayers . . . of thanks for granting me more than one man ' s share of happiness and rewards , and prayers for His continued blessing on this nation and on this movement and on each of you . " Many of the delegates wept with Meany . He tried to gavel the convention to order , but the delegates refused to give Meany his way . Until the year he retired , he had put in a five-day work week , being driven each morning by a chauffeur from his suburban home to the AFL-CIO ' s marble headquarters one block from the White House . Occasionally there would be suggestions in the press that he retire , but Meany usually laughed them away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 13th two- year term as AFL-CIO president , his colleagues were not surprised . A few already had begun to say privately that Meany was losing his clout with Congress and the White House and that he should retire . Meany ' s attitude toward the Carter administration had turned glum in May 1977 , just four months after Carter took office . When asked if organized labor had any reason to be happy with the new administration , Meany replied succinctly , " No ! " Meany frequently spoke bluntly of his displeasure with Carter , particularly concerning the president ' s economic policies . When Carter called for organized labor ' s support in October 1978 for the administration ' s voluntary wage-price guidelines , Meany denounced the anti- inflation program as unfair to workers . A month later , in one of his most caustic attacks on the president , he called Carter the most conservative chief executive since Calvin Coolidge . " Why in the hell did we have to have a small businessman ( as president ) ? " Meany complained . According to Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality clash that left the two estranged . Yet Carter , at Meany ' s farewell appearance , called him a " great American " and said " no American has fought harder for economic justice " for union and non-union workers . " No American has believed so deeply in human dignity ... and no American has loved his country more . " Mr. Meany , on behalf of the American people , thank you and God bless you . " The rumors that Meany might retire began in 1976 , when Meany was plagued with a chronic bronchial condition that hospitalized him several times . In October 1977 he underwent minor surgery to remove a growth from his nose . He had undergone successful surgery in December 1976 for removal of a cataract from his right eye . But he bounced back from those physical ailments and from grumblings by some union leaders that he should turn over the reins of power to a younger person . In December 1977 , he was elected without opposition , but also without total support , to a 12th term as president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority of delegates withheld support by refusing to stand when the vote was taken . " There ' s not enough of us , so why raise any opposition when you know he ' s going to win , " Machinists Union President William Winpisinger , Meany ' s most vocal critic , said before the vote . Though a consistent liberal on bread-and-butter issues that would benefit the working man , Meany was a strong foreign policy conservative . While persistently attacking rising price inflation that plagued the nation during the 1960s and 1970s , Meany steadfastly supported strong military action in Vietnam . He was a dedicated and outspoken anti-communist . It was Sen. George McGovern ' s anti-war stance that led Meany to engineer the AFL-CIO ' s neutral position against all tradition in the 1972 presidential election when McGovern was the Democratic nominee . He called McGovern " an apologist for the Communist world . " Meany ' s AFL-CIO , when it was formed , was the consumate labor federation .
