The 2 1/ 2-acre Singer compound in tiny Marion , Utah ( pop . 200 ) , speaks of simplicity and family ties . The family is indeed close-knit : Vickie Singer 's son-in-law Addam Swapp is married to both her daughters . <P> Last week several hundred feet beyond their fence , the hostile world waited . More than 150 police and FBI agents surrounded the compound shortly after Swapp allegedly dynamited the nearby Mormon church on Jan. 16 . The heavily armed clan of messianic polygamists was holed up with ample food and water , goading the authorities to deliver them to martyrdom and thereby bring about the resurrection of their dead patriarch , Vickie 's husband John Singer . <P> The unfolding drama framed the extremes of modern Mormon life . Utah lures skiers to the slopes of its Wasatch Mountains , but the state is also home to Fundamentalists who find the 20th century anathema .

Founded by John Singer , an American-born TV repairman who spent his formative years in Nazi Germany , the family first ran afoul of the law when Singer pulled his children from school to shield them from the influence of drugs and racial integration . His continued defiance led in 1979 to a siege that ended when police rushed Singer while he was on a trip to his mailbox .

As the ninth anniversary of Singer 's death approached , either Vickie Singer , 44 , or Addam Swapp , 27 , had a vision that John 's resurrection would lead to the Second Coming of Christ . <P> The trouble began soon after the Singer clan watched a videotape of John 's funeral . Marion 's church was badly damaged by an estimated 75 lbs . of dynamite . Nearby , investigators found a feathered spear stuck into the ground with a note that read , " Jan. 18 , 1979 . John Singer was killed on that date . " As seven adults and nine children retreated into the Singer compound , Swapp supposedly told his brother-in-law that he was responsible for the bombing . By telephone , Vickie Singer reportedly declared , " We are going to battle . Yes , there will be death , killing . " <P> State and federal officials said they were determined to resolve the standoff without bloodshed .
