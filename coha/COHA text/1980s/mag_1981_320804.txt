Begin and Sadat can smile , but the missile crisis in Lebanon remains <P> The event was a kind of diplomatic curiosity , a summit that was more of a side show , hastily arranged and with no momentous agenda . <P> It was , in fact , a meeting that was called not so much to work out major agreements as to satisfy the needs of each of the celebrated participants . Under a blazing Sinai sun and a deep azure sky , Israel 's Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat met last week for their tenth summit since Sadat made his ice-breaking visit to Jerusalem in 1977 . <P> The talks did not last long-only 90 minutes , half an hour less than planned . <P> And , as anticipated , they produced no ground-breaking agreement , or at least none the two leaders were willing to reveal .

They talked at the White Elephant , a local restaurant on a sandy strand of beautiful Naama Bay . Relaxed and smiling , the two leaders posed in wicker chairs on the restaurant 's windswept veranda like a couple of contented tourists . There was a brief moment when the air of cordiality at the conference was threatened by an angry demonstration of Israeli settlers , who will be forced to leave when the territory returns to Egypt .
