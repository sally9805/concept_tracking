Now the 29-year-old systems analyst no longer smokes , and his scale registers 170 lbs . Though he had intended to stop smoking and lose weight , Benda got started with the help of an extra incentive : a company-sponsored program that rewards employees for taking steps to safeguard health . By attending smoking or stress workshops , exercising for at least 20 minutes , keeping their weight down , wearing seat belts while driving , or installing smoke detectors at home , employees of the New Jersey consumer health-care giant can earn " Live-for-Life dollars , " good for such items as clocks , fire extinguishers , Frisbees and sweat suits .
