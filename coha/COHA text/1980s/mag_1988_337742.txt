Shortly after the Iran-contra scandal broke in late 1986 , Nancy Reagan became concerned that her husband was not sufficiently alert to the political danger and arranged to have a few people brought in to explain things . To avoid publicity , the White House instructed the guests to report to the Treasury building . From there they were led through an underground tunnel to the adjacent White House . Robert S. Strauss , a former Democratic national chairman and also a frequent luncheon companion of the First Lady , was one of the group . He reports that he pulled no punches with the President . The result ? Well , let Strauss describe it . " The President could not have been more gracious , " says he , " and could not have ignored my advice more effectively . " <P> Oh , well . Bob Strauss is not one to dwell on his failures . As a consummate inside political trader , perhaps the last of the breed , he never lacks new challenges . His predecessors , all the great political bosses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayburn , Johnson  --  are gone now , their reputations eroded by the winds of calamity and reform . Yet if today 's prefab candidates and queasy partisanship make some voters long for the old smoke- filled rooms , they can take heart : the legacy of the backstage impresarios lives on in Strauss . <P> A lawyer and veteran of hothouse politics , Texas style , Strauss has a way , as he puts it , of " getting things done and making things happen . " To some that means " influence peddling . " To others Strauss has become , at 69 , Washington 's pre-eminent cutter of Gordian knots . And if a deadlock develops at the Democratic Convention this summer , some Washingtonians think Strauss will be the keeper of the keys . In fact , a few of his closest friends  --  with aw-shucks encouragement from Strauss  --  want him to be the nominee . <P> The idea , of course , is pretty farfetched . Besides , though Strauss would disagree , the Oval Office might cramp his style . Is Mikhail Gorbachev in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan 's table for the state dinner . ( Helen Strauss , his wife of 46 years , is at a distant table , seated between Caspar Weinberger and Meadowlark Lemon of Harlem Globetrotters fame . ) Is William F. Buckley using his TV show to conduct presidential campaign debates ? Strauss is co-Grand Inquisitor . When bad blood develops between House Speaker Jim Wright and Secretary of State George Shultz over Nicaragua , Strauss mediates . When a new bipartisan National Economic Commission is created , Strauss is quickly appointed and , thanks in no small part to his own efforts , elected co-chairman .
