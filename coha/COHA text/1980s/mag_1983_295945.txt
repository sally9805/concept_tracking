The charge : second degree <P> One year ago this month on Sunset Boulevard , after a sleepless drug-and-liquor binge , John Belushi was injected with a " speedball , " a potent mixture of heroin and cocaine . Early that afternoon the wasted comedian was dead in his hotel bed , and a Hollywood hanger-on named Cathy Smith was in Los Angeles police custody . But Smith , who had been with Belushi all night , was not charged with any crime . Two months later , the tabloid National Enquirer reportedly paid her $15,000 for an interview . The paper quoted her ( inaccurately , she claims ) as saying that she had given Belushi the fatal hypodermic dose . <P> Last week that disputed admission caught up with her : a Los Angeles grand jury indicted Smith for murder and 13 counts of administering a dangerous drug . On Friday night , Smith , a Canadian citizen , surrendered to police in Toronto . Her extradition battle could keep her in Canada at least until June . <P> Evidence against Smith , 35 , includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony of Nelson Lyon , a former writer for the TV show Saturday Night Live who apparently has been given immunity from prosecution . Lyon partied with Belushi during the hours before he died . According to people involved in the case , Lyon testified that he saw Smith inject Belushi with drugs . <P> Nonetheless , with no suggestion that Belushi was drugged against his will , California criminal lawyers believe that the murder case against Smith will be hard to make . But there is a precedent : in 1980 the state court of appeals upheld the second-degree murder conviction of a man who had furnished an unintentionally fatal overdose of heroin to a friend . " California , " said Los Angeles Attorney Robert Sheahen , who has represented Smith , " stands virtually alone in making this kind of thing murder . " Says Smith : " They 're trying to find a scapegoat . "
