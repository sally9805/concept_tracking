CHICAGO  --  Continental Illinois Corp. tentatively settled a major shareholder suit for about $11. 5 million . Under terms of the settlement of the class-action suit , which alleges that Continental and its officers misled investors about its financial condition before the July 1982 collapse of Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City , stockholders represented in the suit also would receive part of any proceeds from other litigation still pending . The $11. 5 million tentative settlement would be paid in zero-coupon bonds . The proposed settlement requires approval of U.S. District Judge John F. Grady here . It would be Continental ' s second major settlement in recent months as the troubled banking company tries to dispense with massive litigation against the parent of Continental Illinois National Bank &; Trust Co. of Chicago . Many bankers see the suits as a major barrier to Continental ' s either finding a merger partner or winning long-term financial support from federal banking regulators . But at least one shareholder attorney expressed opposition to the settlement . Lawrence Walner said he told Judge Grady he thought that the settlement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle , with whom he has had a running battle , don ' t represent most investors ' interests . Last April , Continental settled a lawsuit brought by Michigan National Bank , which sought $57. 4 million in damages for losses it incurred from buying " uncollectable " loans from Penn Square . The Detroit-based bank alleged that Continental vouched for the loans ' quality and agreed to buy them back at Michigan National ' s option . Terms of that settlement weren ' t released , though Continental later disclosed it bought " certain " of the loans to settle the matter . Still pending is a derivative lawsuit against former Continental officers , brought on behalf of the company by shareholders . The suit alleges that the officers failed to follow prudent banking practices , leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in loan losses . The suit is trying to force payment of a $100 million insurance policy Continental has for officer and director negligence .

Ernst &; Whinney , Continental ' s auditor and a defendant in both the class-action and derivative lawsuits , wasn ' t included in the class-action settlement . " They asked us if we were interested in settlement and we said no , " said Thomas D. Allen , the accounting firm ' s attorney . " We aren ' t at fault .
