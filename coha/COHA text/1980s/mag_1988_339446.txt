Like all good TV dramas , this one starts with an exciting precredit sequence . The time is early 1979 , and the network wars have reached a frenzied peak . Sitcoms like Happy Days and Laverne &; Shirley are riding high in the Nielsens . Blockbuster mini-series are vying to reproduce the huge audiences that tuned in for Roots . Star programmer Fred Silverman , the Man with the Golden Gut , is ready to try everything from Gary Coleman to Supertrain in his quest to lift NBC out of the prime-time ratings cellar . <P> So fade in to Sunday , Feb. 11 , 1979 , the evening of the most widely publicized programming matchup in TV history . On CBS : a rare telecast of Gone With the Wind . On NBC : the TV debut of One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . On ABC : a much hyped TV movie , Elvis ! Some network programmers grumble that this costly confrontation amounts to a three-way kamikaze mission . But it draws the crowds . Elvis ! wins a 40% share of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cuckoo 's Nest pulls in 32% . Does that add up to more than 100% ? Indeed : some households had two sets on . <P> Now cut to fall of 1988 and , in network television , nothing adds up . The three networks are still scrapping with one another for ratings supremacy , but the days when they dominated the airwaves so thoroughly are just a Wonder Years memory . Only a few theatrical movies comparable to One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest show up on network TV anymore ; when they do , most people have already seen them on pay cable or videocassette . Gone With the Wind is no longer available to the networks at all ; rights to it are owned by Atlanta TV mogul Ted Turner , who used it to launch his new cable channel , TNT , last week . And the days when TV movies could attract 40% of the viewing audience , almost without trying , are as dead as Elvis . <P> NBC , ABC and CBS  --  the three companies that have virtually defined American television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90  --  may not be dying , but they are sick and fighting for survival . Eating away at their audience is a panoply of new video choices : cable channels , independent stations , videocassette recorders , even an upstart " fourth network . " The three networks ' combined share of the audience shrank to a low of 70% last season , and the decline shows no signs of leveling off . New technologies like home satellite dishes and fiber-optic cable could eventually pose even greater threats . " We 've been outplayed , outsold , outmarketed , outhustled by younger entrepreneurs , " says Howard Stringer , the former president of CBS News recently promoted to head of the CBS Broadcast Group . " We are still the Goliath of broadcasting , but we will be slain by all the little Davids if we do n't pay attention to them . " <P> As if that were n't trauma enough , the networks are struggling through their worst autumn ever . Because of the five-month writers ' strike , which shut down production on most shows during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first of the new series premiered on NBC last week , but others will take months to dribble in . The disruption could give viewers one more excuse to flip the dial and sample the competition  --  just what the networks do n't need .
