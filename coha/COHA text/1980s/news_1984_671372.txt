The issues before the voters , politicians note , have rarely been more critical for the future of Israel . Yet , they say , the election campaign itself has been the most sleepy and restrained that most Israelis can ever recall. // With less than 30 days to go before the election , large party rallies have been few and generally not well attended . Dinner party conversations seem to touch on the election campaign for a moment and then quickly shift to seemingly more interesting topics , such as the black-market rate of the dollar , and pollsters say that roughly one-third of the Israeli public still has not decided whom it wants to vote for. // " There is a real paradox this year , " said Abba Eban , Israel ' s former Foreign Minister and member of the Labor Party leadership . " The election , in terms of the issues , is one of the most crucial : how and at what speed are we going to end the Lebanon involvement , what shape and form is Israel as a nation going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laissez-faire economy ? Yet they are being discussed with the most unusual serenity and tranquillity . " <> <> A Sense of Disillusionment // The campaign has been so quiet that the daily Haaretz suggested tongue-in- cheek that the actors , singers and comedians whom the major parties have hired at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars to sell party slogans should be asked instead to impersonate the politicians altogether in hopes that they might liven things up . " Who needs the originals when you can find much better imitations ? " asked Haaretz. // The nature of Israel ' s 11th parliamentary campaign , which will end with the election July 23 , is highly revealing , though , of the current state of Israeli political life . Political analysts say the low-key campaign reflects the widespread sense of public disillusionment with the country ' s two main parties and the general lack of confidence that in the end either party will be able to solve the pressing problems facing the country. // When Israel was a young country Cabinet ministers used to explain away Government shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Former Prime Minister Levi Eshkol used to joke : " What do you want from me ? My father was not a minister of finance and my grandfather was not a minister of finance . " <> <> Polls Suggest ' Negative ' Vote // Today that is a joke Israeli politicians can ' t tell on themselves anymore and the voters seem to know it. // " In 1977 the voters turned out Labor after it had ruled the country for 29 years because the people had lost confidence in it , " said Yitzhak Berman , a former Speaker of Parliament and a leader of the Liberal wing of the Likud party . " Now the Likud has lost the people ' s confidence , so you could say that the people have lost confidence in both major parties. " // According to Daniel J. Elazar , president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs , polls indicate that most Israelis are going to vote " negative " this election. // " We can see from the private polls that many people are going to vote ' against ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will vote Likud only because they are disgusted with Labor . And Likud people will vote for Labor only because they are disgusted with Likud . But neither party seems to be offering voters anything like a sense that it can come to grips with the country ' s problems or that it has attractive leaders who are appealing in and of themselves . " <> <> Lots of Smiling Faces // This was clearly apparent in the political advertising campaigns that began Monday night on Israeli television . Israeli election law provides for limited free television time every night for all major parties beginning 30 days before the election. // Both the Labor and Likud programs tended to resemble Pepsi commercials , made up of lots of smiling faces , people having fun and testifying about how good either Labor or Likud would be . Both parties , for some reason , showed film clips of people surfing , as though the country had a large surfer vote. // Neither party really seemed to want to discuss in detail the critical problems facing the public - the Likud because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as runaway inflation , were created and Labor because it believes that many of the undecided voters are former Likud supporters and it doesn ' t want to turn them off by making them feel stupid for having voted Likud. // The war in Lebanon , for instance , should be a hotly contested issue , but isn ' t . Few Israelis seem interested anymore in debating about Lebanon ; all they want to know is , " How do we get out ? " According to the pollster Hanoch Smith , a significant majority of Israelis covering both parties believe that Israel should not withdraw until it can arrange the proper security guarantees. // As for the future of the occupied West Bank , the differences between the Labor Party and Likud appear relatively minor . In reality they are not . But without any Arab country ready to negotiate with Israel about the future of the West Bank , Labor Party officials are reluctant to discuss their readiness for territorial compromise because they feel it will lose them votes from the right . <> <> Ethnic Tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli society and were a potent issue in the 1981 election , have been muted in this campaign by the fact that the Sephardim , or Oriental Jews , have advanced so rapidly politically since the last election . Both Labor and Likud have highly popular Sephardim as the No. 2 men in their leaderships : David Levy for Likud and former President Yitzhak Navon for Labor. // Israel ' s economic problems , 400 percent inflation and what the newspapers call " daily devalutions , " should be an ideal issue for Labor to focus on . However , polls have found that thanks to indexing - which keeps most Israeli incomes in pace with the inflation rate - many Israelis are not feeling hurt by the state of the economy. // " Most people look around and see they are a lot better off than they were seven years ago , " said Ehud Olmert , a Member of Parliament and prominent official in the Likud campaign strategy team . " They have a new house , a new TV and probably a new car . The state may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing fine . This acts in favor of Likud. " // The Labor Party can not concentrate too closely on how it will cure the economy because to cure the economy , noted one senior Labor official , will require " blood , sweat , toil and tears , and nobody ever got elected on that slogan. " // //
