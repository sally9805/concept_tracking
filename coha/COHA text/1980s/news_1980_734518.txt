txt McCLURE , PA  --  The full history of the annual McClure Bean Soup Festival has not been written , and much of it is lost in the mists of time . What remains is stored in the memory of Samuel H. Bubb , and he is n't quite sure who started it , or when . " It began as a sort of reunion for Union army veterans of the Civil War , " he said . " My grandfather was one of them . But just when the first one was held , or which army unit held it , well , I just could n't say . " We sat at the counter of the barbecue stand in the McClure Fairgrounds , a flat place in the Tuscarora mountain country of central Pennsylvania . The smoke and smells of cooking pork hung in the summer air as Sam Bubb told his story . " It was private affair , just for the veterans and their families , and they cooked up a big pot of bean soup . I suppose it was because that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " AS THE YEARS passed the ranks ( of veterans ) thinned , you know . but the tradition had caught on . Capt . Ilenry A. Riser , a McClure man , held it together . Then in 1891 ? around then , anyway ? a man named Ner B. MIddleswarth got the politicians into it . That was the first public festival , which would make this one the 88th . The politicians used it as a rally . They still do , at least the Republicans do , on Saturday , " " I remember as a boy , they held It out at Joe Ilassler 's farm , but it was somewhere else before . " Sonic time around 1915 it was moved here to the park ? It 's been growing ever since , When I joined the festival committee in 1921 , we sold eight pots of soup . Those are 35-gallon iron pots I 'm talking about , and each one will feed about 275 people . This year , if the weather lets us , we 'll do 90 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes McClure , a town of about 1,004 located at the foot of Shade Mountain , home of the biggest bean-soup festival in the world . Sam Bubb , octogenarian banker , has been running the festival for 52 years and has Made it what it is . Now he has the aid of his son Kirby , 30 . Sam Bubb had changed Into his Union officer 's hat and jacket of blue cheesecloth . He wore no insignia of rank , but there ? as no doubt who was in command . " This is a good thing for the community , " he said . " The women 's club , the Lions , and the other service clubs raise funds here , and some of the money goes to keep up the town 's free swimming pool . It gives people a chance to make a little extra money working here and we have a good time . " FIFTEEN FEET AWAY was the roasting shed , where smoke and the smell of cooked pork seeped from four outsized steel charcoal-cookers made of surplus Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two 350-pound pigs wrapped in chicken wire hung on 8-foot skewers . In front of the shed a scene resembling a professional tag-team wrestling match was in progress . Ron Patter and Steve Zerby , looking like squat , powerful twins in blue " Hogs are Beautiful " T-shirts , white aprons and tall , wide  --  brimmed black hats with bands of blue , were grappling with the vast , pink torso of a third animal . Grunting and straining , they heaved it from the bad ( of an old station wagon onto a sturdy table . " It 's heavy work , but a big hog takes less time and trouble to fix than two little ones , " Peffer said . " Course , they take longer to cook . We put those other two on yesterday . It takes 12 to 16 hours to make sure they 're done . " He turned to show us the back of his T-shirt , on which was lettered " Poppa Sam 's Hog Wallow , " and told us that was in honor of Soft Bubb . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manager of the barbecue operation . He told us that the price of the barbecue platter , which includes a generous portion of pork , celery-and-breadcrumb stuffing , white gravy and horseradish sauce , had been cut to $3.25 this year , from last year 's 83.50 . " We were n't going to try to fool these Penn Dutch farmers , " he said . " They 're tough . They all know the price of hogs is down , All the other festivals around the state did less business this year . We 're doing just the same , even with the gas situation . " WE JAWED with Bubb until It was soup time . Some of the paper-covered green picnic tables already were taken when we got to the 400-seat dining area . Puffs of steam and smoke billowed from the kitchen . At the service counter Shirley Tyson and Elizabeth Forgy were doling out pint bowls of soup to a short line of customers . The prices were 85 cents a bowl , $1.50 for a take-home quart . " You have to keep stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole pot of soup , " Bob Herbster told us . Ilerbster , who works for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation ( Penn DOT ) , has been the festival chef for 16 years . He showed us how the soup pots are moved from the stove to the counter with a windlass ? an overhead trolley system that was installed about 30 years ago . " Keeping the soup in the pot keeps it hot , " he said . " It has to be hot , you know , or the people will complain . " " This has got to be the hottest soup in the world , " said Randy Undercuffler from Dalmatia , Pa. lie probably was right . Even after a two-minute wait , it was hot enough to burn a reporter 's tongue and most of the inside of his mouth . Pretty good , though , and filling , with a sprinkling of little oyster crackers .
