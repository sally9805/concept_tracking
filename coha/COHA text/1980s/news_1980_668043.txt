In the wild celebration that followed Sixto Lezcano ' s dramatic , game-winning grand slam , they were temporarily forgotten . But what came to mind after things quieted down were a pair of battles involving Gorman Thomas and two Red Sox pitchers that had a lot to do with the Brewers ' 9-5 victory . " The same thing happened to ( Dick ) Drago that happened to me , " said Red Sox starter Dennis Eckersley , who had walked Thomas in the fourth inning . " I threw him ( Thomas ) a lot of pitches ( 11 ) and lost him . Then Sixto hit the next pitch for a home run . He ' s a strong young man . " Drago , who gave up the bases-loaded blast with two outs and two strikes in the ninth , had thrown eight pitches to Thomas . Four had been fouled off , including one that would have been catchable had the rain tarp not been in the way . Thomas stepped out of the box four times in the cat-and-mouse game . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ballpark . " I had a chance to watch Drago a long time , " Lezcano said later . " I figured he wouldn ' t waste any pitches to me . I figured he ' d come in with a fastball , and that ' s exactly what he did . " If there is a lesson to be learned from the game , it is that Milwaukee is as dangerous as any team in baseball . Thomas led the American League in home runs ( 45 ) in 1979 , and before you fault him for striking out 175 times ( an AL high ) , remember that he was second overall in walks ( 98 ) . And Lezcano , who batted .321 last year , finished third in slugging percentage ( .573 ) behind Boston ' s Fred Lynn and Jim Rice . " All of us here have been striving to become better hitters , " said Thomas . " Sixto ' s made hitting the ball hard to right and right-center his bread and butter , " said Thomas . " He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might pull the other way . Truthfully , he ' s just learning how to make contact . When he really learns it , he will be a fantastic hitter . " Lezcano ' s first home run yesterday came off an Eckersley mistake . The Eck threw a weak slider that the Brewer outfielder simply crushed , rocketing the ball over the left-field fence . " I ' m sure seeing me pitch to Thomas helped Lezcano , " said the Eck . " In the past , you could fool Thomas with breaking stuff or fastballs out of the strike zone . But he has become a lot more selective and is a good hitter . You could see that by the double he ripped off Renko . " I didn ' t mind when ( Ben ) Oglivie took me deep ( a fourth-inning homer ) . It was just a lousy slider . But when Lezcano pulled one to left for a home run , I knew that I was in trouble and that I wasn ' t going to fool them for seven innings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hitters are going to catch up to you . " Drago might have escaped his date with Lezcano in the ninth with a little luck . But neither Butch Hobson nor Rick Burleson was tall enough to stretch over the rain tarp on the third-base side to catch one of the foul balls hit by Thomas . " Shows you how funny this game is , " said Zimmer . " The ball was catchable if the play had been on the other side . Dick was pitching very well . You can ' t blame him on the home run either . If it was a slider or a curve , maybe , but this young man drove a low fastball over the fence . He is very , very strong . " Lezcano said that all the Brewers are good hitters , particularly to the opposite field , and that it comes from good instruction from Harvey Kuenn . Kuenn , who called from Sun City , Ariz. , after the game to congratulate Lezcano , is recuperating from an operation in which his right leg was amputated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lezcano , " was that for a righthanded hitter , the ball will be over the outside half of the plate about 75 percent of the time . So you must learn to hit that pitch and hit it hard . What I mainly wanted to do was hit it on the ground hard , someplace . " The Brewers found out early that the faith they ' ve put in Reggie Cleveland as their bullpen ace might not be as big a gamble as they thought . Reggie shut down the Red Sox in the ninth inning and gained the victory . " I have to admit I was nervous , " said Cleveland . " I had a terrible time against Boston last year . Embarrassed ? My whole year was an embarrassment . " But I talked to my wife last night and told her I would have good news for her today . I had been throwing well in spring training . I found myself again , and I knew I could do it . Well , I ' m going to call her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that it was special to beat Boston . But I will say that I enjoyed it .
