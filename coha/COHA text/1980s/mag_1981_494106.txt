simple rhythmic pattern . Perhaps he believes that in superficial musical complexity lies neuroses ; in apparent rhythmic , harmonic , and melodic indi ? rectness , spiritual confusion . In his re ? ductio ad absurdum of musical elements , Glass attempts a musical equivalent of minimal art . In light of his collaboration with artists like Sol LeWitt , perhaps Satyagraha is Glass 's version of a musical minimalism which seeks to redeem the inherent purity of notes and rhythms or sounds that can be anticipated and easily remembered , of basic intervals and rhythms that all are truly at the heart of musical power and beauty . But if this is his intention , then here again Glass fails . Minimalism in painting and in sculpture strikes the viewer , if suc ? cessful , by the simplicity of invention , by the magic of color and form in their precise and most exquisite presenta ? tion . Successful visual minimalism es ? chews the arbitrary , the falsely decora ? tive , the confusion of cluttered eclec ? ticism ; but its simplicity provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It avoids easy reference from the visual to the nonvisual , to the descriptive , to the literary , and to the obviously philosophical . Adequate min ? imalism in music would have to be justi ? fied by such criteria . But Glass 's version of minimalism is not minimal . Huge orchestral textures are employed . Mas ? sive durations of time and the appear ? ance of a Wagnerian spectacle vitiate any claim to simplicity . ABOVE ALL , Satyagraha lacks the most important dimension of any music , whether popular or self-con ? sciously serious , whether apparently simple or complex in its elements . It lacks invention , It lacks the capacity to engage the audience , either by daunt ? ing its expectations of what will come next or , with subtlety , by maintaining interest through imaginative consisten ? cy . Even the great writers of repetitive piano studies like Czerny and Hanon were inventive . Last , but not least , Glass 's work does not possess even that other possible saving grace ? a sense of humor . Listening to Satyagraha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sons , a composer wishes to employ an old-fashioned compositional style or only the simplest elements of music to reach a new audience and inspire a new experience , his work must still be mea ? sured by the criteria of authenticity , inventiveness , and entertainment . In 1964 , I was coordinating the local Democratic campaign in my home town of Sioux City , Iowa . Sioux City is not exactly a bastion of Democratic strength ; indeed , one of the major functions of the local party was to find enough can ? didates to fill the ballot . A few weeks before the election , our candidate for state senator ? a sometime social worker and truck driver named Vincent 5 . Burke ? came to see me with a proposal . Vincent wanted $300 from the party 's meager treasury to rent a truck . Vin ? cent said he would place posters for the party 's candidates ? President Lyndon Johnson , Hubert Humphrey , Governor Harold Hughes , etc. ? on the truck and drive it through town . Democrats would see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told him the truck was a great idea , but that we were very short of funds . Vincent was not happy . But , somehow , he raised the money for the truck elsewhere . On election day , Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in Iowa by a landslide . Harold Hughes won reelec ? tion by a larger margin than any other candidate in the history of the state . The entire Democratic ticket in Sioux City ( including Vincent Burke ) was swept into office . In fact , there were so many " straight ticket " Democratic votes that the blank space on the Democratic line for county attorney outpolled the Republican nominee for the job . A few days after the election , I ran into Vincent Burke . He pulled me aside and whispered conspiratorially in my ear . " Well , " he said , " did you see ? Did you see ? " " Did I see what ? " I asked Vincent . " The truck , " he replied . " The truck worked . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point , was that Adlai Stevenson had not known about the truck . Politics is art , not science . No one considered rerunning the 1964 election in Sioux City , minus Vincent 's truck , to determine whether it was the decisive factor . In national elections , voting re ? turns and public opinion polls usually provide enough varied evidence for any skilled analyst or propagandist to ex ? plain the results , in terms consistent with his own ideological , political , or historical views ; and there 's never any real way to prove or disprove such explanations . Analyses of election results generally focus on one of two areas : either on the candidates , their strategies and cam ? paigns , or on the electorate itself . These differing perspectives were exemplified in the two major post-election books of the 1960s : the first in Theodore White 's The Making of the President , 1960 , follow ? ing John Kennedy 's election ; and the second in Kevin Phillips 's The Emerging Republican Majority , following Richard Nixon 's 1968 victory . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . White provided the first major insight into the decline of the parties as viable institutions and their replacement by independent candidate organizations and the media . Phillips presented one of the earliest analyses of the dissolution of the New Deal coalition . But both books also shared a fault common to nearly all post-election studies : their tones reflected the fact that the authors knew the results of the elections . Had some 15,000 voters in two states ( out of more than 68 million voters ) switched from John Kennedy to Richard Nixon in 1960 , Nixon would have been elected and White 's book would have had a very different focus . Had some 118,000 voters in four states ( out of some 73 million ) voted for Hubert Humphrey instead of Nixon in 1968 , Humphrey would have been elected and Phillips 's book would have been scrapped , or at least retitled , by his publishers . FOLLOWING the 1980 elections , the two parties joined election ana ? lysts in dividing into those who focused on candidates and those who looked to the electorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously hoped , that the key to the result was the candidates , their campaigns and their strategies ? that Jimmy Carter had alienated his Democratic base , mis ? managed the presidency , poorly handled the politics of reelection , and given the election to Ronald Reagan . Conserva ? tive Republicans , on the other hand , wanted the focus placed on the voters ; they said , and nervously hoped , that the Reagan victory reflected a fun ? damental shift to the right in public opinion , a basic realignment in the elec ? torate , and the emergence , delayed by Watergate , of a conservative Republi ? can majority . Public opinion polls did little to re ? solve the matter . One Sunday morning a few weeks after the election , the New York Times and the Washington Star both reported on national post-election polls . The Times story found little ideological shift and viewed the election as a refer ? endum on the Carter presidency ; the Star saw a clearer move to the right ideologically . In fact the two stories were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters . An unusual number of post-election books recently have been or soon will be published that explore what really happened in 1980 . Among those partic ? ularly worth reading are the following . Elizabeth Drew 's Portrait of an Election is unique in three respects . First , it in ? cludes essays Drew wrote during the campaign for publication in the New Yorker . Thus it avoids the inherent bias of retrospect apparent in most other post-election books . Second , Drew 's ac ? cumulation of details provides thesharpest possible picture of the per ? sonal motivations of the candidates and the politicians involved . Third , the ap ? pendix of the book is valuable reading ; it includes the strategy memos prepared by Richard Wirthlin and Patrick Cad ? dell , the pollsters and major strategists for Presidents Reagan and Carter . Blue Smoke and Mirrors : How Reagan Won and Why Carter Lost the Election of 1980 by Jules Witcover and Jack Germond is the year 's successor to White 's 1960 book . Writing after the election , the authors identify and organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . They argue that the election was determined by events , par ? ticularly Iran , beyond the strategists ' control . The American Elections of 1980 is a series of essays edited by neoconservative Democrat Austin Ranney for the mod ? erately conservative and Republican-oriented American Enterprise Institute . It includes plenty of discussion by such authors as the Wall Street Journal 's Al Hunt of the candidates and their han ? dling of issues and strategy . It also probes more deeply than the other books into transitions in the electorate and the electoral process . Two other books should also be men ? tioned . The Hidden Election : Politics and Eco ? nomics in the 1980 Presidential Campaign , edited by Thomas Ferguson and Joel Rogers ( Pantheon , $25.95 ) , is a series of essays which generally indicate that the " real " choice in 1980 was minimal . Both Carter and Reagan bought basic " cor ? porate " economics , and there was no real " left alternative " for the voters .

MY OWN READING of the 1980 election ? after reviewing the events and the polls ? does not fit neat ? ly into either the candidate/campaign ? oriented explanation of the liberals or the **31;2700;TOOLONG analysis of the conservatives . I begin with the view that an Ameri ? can presidential election is , fundamen ? tally , a referendum on the status quo , rather than a choice between compet ? ing ideologies or issue positions . Carter " lost " this referendum early in 1980 . He was the only Democratic President in history to seek reelection during a year of increasing unemployment and wasperceived to be a weak and ineffective leader . The people wanted change . The real campaign , therefore , was Reagan versus Reagan . The real issue was whether Reagan 's election posed too great a risk ? either to peace or to social security benefits ? to take in order to get rid of an unacceptable incumbent . The ball was in Reagan 's court and there was little Carter could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What he could do was ( 1 ) appear presi ? dential ; ( 2 ) unite the Democratic Par ? ty 's base constituencies in fear of Rea ? gan ; and ( 3 ) avoid debating Reagan and giving him the opportunity to appear " equal " in stature to the President and a " safe " choice . Carter displayed some lack of skill in all three areas ? but that was what brought him the trouble in the beginning . REAGAN 'S MANAGERS , from the inception of the campaign , under ? stood the problem . They worked as much as they could ( 1 ) to emphasize economic issues , rather than social and cultural ones , which divide the Republi ? cans ; ( 2 ) to stress Reagan 's record as governor and his ability to get " good people " under him ; and ( 3 ) to limit , as much as possible , Reagan 's ability and opportunity to make spontaneous re ? marks . They generally succeeded in these goals . Reagan was also helped in his effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , John Anderson : he had credibility with millions of independent moderates who were too pragmatic to vote for him , but were swayed by his pronouncement that Carter and Rea ? gan were equally bad and concluded that choosing Reagan posed no greater risk than maintaining the status quo . Second , Ronald Reagan : his age and affable personality made it tough to portray him as a dangerous radical . The fact that these " personal " factors shaped the results should not , however , reassure liberals that more fundamen ? tal problems are not facing them . One reason for the failure of the Carter presidency ? and for the despondency in liberal ranks following his defeat ? was the fact that liberals had no clear-cut , identifiable agenda for the nation . The main items on their agenda were enacted ( civil rights , environmental safeguards , nutritional programs , etc. ) and there was little consensus on why one should support Carter , other than to stop Reagan . As recently as sev eral weeks ago , a leading liberal trade unionist told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lucky not to be in power . " Assume Mon-dale was in the White House , " he asked , " just what the hell would he do about these problems ? " Nor can liberals and Democrats af ? ford to ignore the fact that conserva ? tives are correct , to a large extent , when they talk about the dissolution of the New Deal coalition . That gradual disso ? lution has been taking place since the coalition elected FDR in 1932 . The New Deal Majority consisted of a group of minorities ? Catholics , Jews , first-gen ? eration Americans , Southerners , blacks , union members , urban dwellers ? each of which considered itself outside the power structure and alienated from an American majority , which was per ? ceived to be Northern , white , Protes ? tant , native-born , middle-class , and Re ? publican . The goal of the New Deal coalition was to broaden the American mainstream to include its minorities and , with the notable exception of blacks , it succeeded . TAKE SOUTHERNERS . When FDR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ( South Carolina ) was 25 percent that of the richest ( Connecticut ) ; now the figure is about 75 percent . Since FOR , one border-state politician with Confeder ? ate roots ( Truman ) and two Southern ? ers ( Johnson and Carter ) have entered the White House . Civil rights reforms have encouraged industry and individ ? uals to move to the South . Being South ? ern is no longer the basis for voting Democratic . The United States Senate tells the story : in 1954 , the last time the Republican Party controlled the Senate , the 22 Southern senators were all Democrats ( Northerners were Repub ? lican , 49-25 ) ; today the 22 Southern senators are evenly divided ( Northern ? ers are narrowly Republican , 42-36 ) . Or take Catholics . When I grew up in Iowa , the state was about 75 percent Protestant and 25 percent Catholic . Usually , the Protestants voted 2 to 1 Republican , and the Catholics 3 to 1 Democratic . When former Senator Dick Clark lost to Senator Roger Jepsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant vote , far higher than normal for Democrats in the past . But he dropped to only 55 percent of the Catholic vote . The level of Democratic support among Catholic voters over that of support among Protestant voters had fallen from 40 percent to 10 per ? cent . Why ? Polls showed that " Catholic issues " like abortion and tuition tax credits had some limited impact , but far more important was the fact that Catholics no longer perceived them ? selves to be members of a minority out ? side the American mainstream . To be a Catholic or a Southerner no longer makes one an outsider ? and no longer automatically classifies one as a Democrat . ( Such voters do remain gen ? erally Democratic in elections with no meaningful issue differences . Most peo ? ple vote the party of their parents , and change is gradual . ) Indeed , if FDR and Herbert Hoover were to return to America today , they would be greatly surprised to find that Alabama and Oklahoma are represented by Catholic Republicans in the U.S. Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also declining . Race remains a clear indicator , since blacks remain outside the mainstream , but Democrats can not count on blind loyalty from blacks either . Such Republican Senators as Thad Cochran ( Mississippi ) , Mack Mattingly ( Georgia ) , and Charles Percy ( Illinois ) received significant black support . The New Deal 's problem ? Basically , it is that it worked . But the dissolution of the New Deal coalition does not por ? tend its replacement by another major ? ity coalition . There will not necessarily be a realignment along clear class , reli ? gious , regional , or other lines . And the evidence of a realignment along ideological lines is just as slim . The fact is that Ronald Reagan 's basic campaign strategy was to focus the election on valence , or nonideological issues , on which both candidates take the same position ( against hostages , against inflation , against unemploy ? ment , against waste and inefficiency in government , against crime , for honesty , for competence ) . The contest thus be ? comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideological issues dividing the candidates ( national health insurance , abortion , gun control , ERA , SALT , etc. ) the public was closer to Car ? ter 's position than to Reagan 's . Presi ? dent Reagan 's claims that the election provided him with an ideological man ? date were made after the campaign , not during it , when , for example , he asserted that the differences between him and Carter on ERA simply involved methodology for achieving equality . What then can be concluded from the 1980 election ? First , that the New Deal coalition ? and , to some extent , political coalitions based on regional , religious , ethnic , and , to a lesser extent , class lines ? is losing its coherence and power . The issues and campaigns in American politics have been nationalized ; at the same time , the media has had an opposite , individualiz ? ing effect on politics , by making the relationship between the voter and the candidate more direct than it has ever been . Groups are no longer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the liberal agenda of the 1960s ( voting rights , Medicare for the elderly , Medicaid for the poor , school lunches , environmental regulations , etc. ) has not been replaced by any new liberal program . The aim now is simply to preserve the old gains from assault by the New Right . Third , that the American voter is pragmatic rather than ideological . Sup ? port for basic New Deal programs and the major social advances of the 1960s has not lessened . Antipathy to govern Living though I do in a military environ ? ment , I have n't yet had to confront the question of accepting women into the armed services . For the British forces , though four percent female , remain entirely masculine in ethos and the ser ? vicewomen themselves show no sign of wanting it otherwise . They seem happy to wear a distinctively feminine uni ? form , to preserve their separate women 's corps , and to continue to per ? form noncombat tasks . It was a consid ? erable surprise , therefore , to discover from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life how nearly complete is the integration of the two sexes in the U.S. armed forces and ment programs and spending has in ? creased , but that antipathy is less ideo ? logical than pragmatic . It is based on concerns about the programs ' impracti ? cality , and their failure to meet the goals for which they were created , along with worry about increasing gov ? ernment deficits and inflation . Fourth , the problems of the country are severe enough , the public alienated enough , and the presidency demysti ? fied enough , that people are probably more inclined to risk change ? on the grounds that things ca n't get worse ? than they have been during much of the past . ( Polls shortly before the elec ? tion showed that 30 percent of the voters would have supported Anderson if they had thought he had a chance to win . ) In the current political period , the danger for conservative Republicans is to attempt to read more than this con ? clusion from the 1980 results . The danger for liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conclusion . how anxious some women soldiers are that the remaining barriers should be dismantled . There are American women who really do want to fight , men who support their case , and as yet no clear legal grounds for excluding them from combat . As Helen Rogan recounts , the women derive their case from the Equal Rights Amendment of 1972 , which only the failure of the requisite number of states to ratify has prevented from passing into law . But since August 1981 the Army has temporarily sus ? pended the recruitment of women , be ? cause of the strong emotions the issue arouses within the service . American male soldiers , it seems , experienced something akin to biological shock at the idea of sharing a foxhole with a woman buddy . The emotions of all American servicewomen , whether for or against the integration of combat units , have , however , been equally aroused by this reaction . Very few would be willing ever again , they told Helen Rogan , to settle for the separate and unequal status occupied by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlist women , during World War I , and they have been by no means behind other Anglo-Saxon nations , themselves pioneers in this respect , in accepting that women had the right to legal equality with the other sex . If their military women continue to accept a subordinate role , what is it which prompts their American sisters to reject it ? Is it a national difference ? Or is it something about the way military men treat women who come within their ambit , perhaps more pronounced on the western than the eastern side of the Atlantic , which explains the contrast ? Ignorant as I was of the context in which women have served , I thought it might be useful to dig about in the lit ? erature of female military service , such as it is , in an effort to understand this new impatience . I began with a little book , published in 1942 , called She Walks in Battledress , by Anthony Cotterell ? a journalist 's ac ? count of the women 's services in Brit ? ain during World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . Historians are used to decoding ? indeed , that 's the fashionable way for them to describe to each other what they do : translating the metaphor of a former age into that of our own . But how the devil , I asked myself as I leafed with increasing disbe ? lief through the pages of the book , do you translate this sort of stuff ? In a mixed anti-aircraft battery , there are 229 women and 189 men ( includ ? ing officers ) . Roughly speaking , the men do the shooting and the women do everything else .. . . The women definitely take rather a pride in being treated as men 's equals , and they are extremely loyal . There is a strong element of hero-worship about their attitudes , the same kind of quality which makes women in a factory come out on strike when the foreman is fired . Wheeauiouw ! ! ! , as Tom Wolfe might say . Granted , this was written before               @ @ @ @ @ @
