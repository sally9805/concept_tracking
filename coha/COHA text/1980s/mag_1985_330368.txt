Immigration is frequently an uneven transaction . When a scientist from India or a professor from Guatemala or a physician from the Philippines moves to the U.S. , America 's gain is the native land 's loss . Since few American professionals head out to settle elsewhere in the world , the redistribution of talent serves only to widen the gap between the land of plenty and the lands of poverty . Worse still , the cycle tends to perpetuate itself : as more people leave their native country for the U.S. , more are likely to leave , to join relatives or cash in on connections or simply follow examples . <P> Though nothing new , the brain drain has recently seemed more than ever to be taking from the poor and giving to the rich : whereas 30 years ago most well- qualified newcomers to the U.S. arrived from Europe , now they stream in from the poorer countries of the Third World . " It is indeed paradoxical , " says Dr. D.N . Misra , adviser to India 's Council of Scientific and Industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest need for scientists , engineers , managers and other professionals , are in fact losing many of their best-educated young men to the developed countries . " Even among unskilled workers , the U.S. tends to attract the most enterprising  --  those who are adventurous enough to quit their homes and strike out for new opportunities in America . <P> The first to leave are outstanding students who win admission to U.S. universities and who , not surprisingly , accept challenging jobs and high salaries in America upon their graduation . Each year , for instance , some 6,000 Taiwan Chinese arrive to study in the U.S. ; no more than 20% ever return home . Many of the top achievers at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur are snapped up by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration . " These students are dedicated individuals of discipline , diligence and dignity , " says Robert Ringler , an associate dean of the University of California , Los Angeles , who is an adviser to Asian students . " They are a treasure to any country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the resources to nurture and hold on to them . " <P> No less costly to Third World nations is the steady migration of well- trained professionals in search of a life , any life , in America . The wage differential between the U.S. and Mexico , for example , is 15 to 1 . For many others , even poverty in the U.S. is preferable to an uneasy prosperity at home : thus lawyers and doctors from Central America may be found washing cars or working as bellhops in Miami . Other highly skilled people are driven to emigrate not by economic choice but by political circumstance . During their genocidal 45-month reign in Kampuchea , the Khmer Rouge killed roughly 2 million people , many of them white-collar workers . As a result , around 70% of the Kampucheans in the U.S. are professionals . <P> Whatever the cause , the cost for countries that lose minds and hearts to the U.S. can be high . The presence of 8,000 Israeli engineers in the U.S. has , according to Yosef Kucik , emigration adviser to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of sophisticated industry in Israel . " Around half of the 1,000 students who graduate each year from the 27 medical schools in the Philippines go abroad , leaving one doctor tending to as many as 20,000 people in some of the archipelago 's rural areas .
