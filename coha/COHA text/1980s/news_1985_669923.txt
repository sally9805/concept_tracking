NEW YORK  --  " The first thing we do , " Shakespeare wrote , " let ' s kill all the lawyers . " But then Shakespeare was never evicted from his loft , audited by the Internal Revenue Service , arrested for running a " sex show " or tangled in contract negotiations with International Business Machines Corp . Impecunious artists who face such problems today can get some cheap help from Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts ( VLA ) . The group was started here in 1969 by lawyers who recognized that artists are actually running small businesses with special legal problems in such areas as contracts and copyrights . Because they can ' t afford lawyers and are sometimes perversely proud of being nonbusinesslike , artists are often pushed around . Now 37 cities around the country have groups referring artists to lawyers willing to handle an occasional arts-related case on the side . Apart from a minimal administrative fee to the group , the help is free . Last year , 800 VLA lawyers dispensed about $3 million worth of legal services on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t usually life-or-death matters , " says Tim Jensen , one of two full-time lawyers with the VLA here . " But the artists often stand to lose a lot , and if we don ' t help them , no one will . " The lawyers have rescued a number of arts organizations from oblivion . In Philadelphia , volunteers donated more than $25 , 000 in legal work to save the 20-year-old Pennsylvania Ballet . In 1982 , the ballet company had canceled its season and laid off its dancers as debts neared $3 million . The company , says its controller , was " dangling over the edge . " The VLA got three bankruptcy lawyers to negotiate with creditors for the forgiveness or restructuring of debts . Since then , under new leadership , the company is back on stage and in the black . Duo Theater , a nonprofit New York theater group that performs modern Hispanic plays alternately in Spanish and English , was saved from extinction by the VLA . " They were typical in that their business practices weren ' t always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell Holtzman . Because they had neglected to file a certain IRS form a decade before , Duo Theater owed the IRS a $15 , 000 penalty by 1983 , an amount exceeding its annual budget . Mr. Holtzman appealed and got the IRS to drop the fine to $5 . Artists are often blind to the legal ramifications of their work . " It ' s upsetting when the police come after you and it ' s frightening to be in court , " says Mario Teruel , a Chicago performance artist . An exhibit called " The Sex Show " organized at a storefront gallery by Mr. Teruel and another artist was closed by police in 1983 , and 150 people were ordered out . Mr. Teruel was issued several summonses . Joan Kurlan , executive director of Lawyers for the Creative Arts in Chicago , says that " residents of the blue-collar neighborhood thought the art gallery was a porn shop and asked the alderman to close it . " The exhibit , which included movies , lectures and performance art about " sexuality in society , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like live-sex parlors in the area . The exhibit was ready to close anyway , but a volunteer lawyer went to court twice with Mr. Teruel and persuaded the judge to drop the fines and keep the tickets unrecorded . Many VLA legal matters are routine , including simple questions on contracts and copyrights . Liz Phillips , a New York artist , needed a lawyer to write a contract with IBM of Japan , which is displaying one of her sound sculptures for a year . The seven-page document included size and engineering details that the artist requested , but also gave her protection that she didn ' t even know she needed . One example : IBM can ' t copy the piece or any of its parts . Particularly in New York , the VLA perceives education as a big part of its mission . It offers seminars and distributes pamphlets . " Fear of Filing , " a substantial VLA-compiled book about tax preparation for artists , has sold more than 10 , 000 copies at $12. 95 each . Volunteer lawyer groups around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups incorporate as nonprofit entities , and then apply for tax-exempt status from the IRS . Doing so helps enormously in raising money but involves at least 10 hours of legal work . Graywolf Press , a small literary publishing house in Port Townsend , Wash. , said it could easily have spent $1 , 500 on law fees to go tax-exempt , but the VLA charged a $50 administrative fee . Among the New York groups that got their nonprofit standing with VLA help are Twyla Tharp ' s dance company and the Big Apple Circus . ( Both are too successful today to qualify for help : Organizations must have an annual budget below $100 , 000 and artists an income below $10 , 000 . ) Landlord battles are another common issue . In a recent case , a New York composer was nearly evicted from her apartment because her downstairs neighbor objected to her piano practicing . The VLA threated to sue , and the building ' s management agreed to offer the composer another apartment in the building . VLA lawyers say they can often solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because people assume they can ' t push back . In several cases , art galleries that hadn ' t returned an artist ' s unsold works or sent payment for works sold , complied soon after receiving demands on legal-letterhead stationery . In a more bizarre case , an off-Broadway theater company in New York lost about $3 , 000 in box-office receipts when a theater employee was handcuffed to a grille and robbed  --  inside a bank  --  by a man dressed as a security guard . The bank refused to refund the loss until it received a letter from a VLA lawyer citing court cases in which banks had been held liable for similar muggings . Perhaps one reason volunteer lawyer groups understand artists is that they too are nonprofit organizations , often struggling to keep an office open with grants , donations and benefit balls . The VLA office here , for example , doesn ' t have the look of a posh , paneled law firm . Desks are cluttered and posters advertising shows for client artists cover the walls . The posters hide graffiti left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract reviewed . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
