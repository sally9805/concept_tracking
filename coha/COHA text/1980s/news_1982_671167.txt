" Our payments will be over $900 a month , " Mr. Flynn said , " but six months ago the payments would have been almost $1 , 300 . We decided we ' d better buy now before interest and prices went up again. " // According to recent interviews with home buyers , sellers , lenders and brokers , an upsurge in new home sales is being led in many communities by white-collar and professional couples in their late 20 ' s and early 30 ' s . Like the Flynns , these buyers have relatively high combined incomes , have not been hurt significantly by the recession and have been waiting for rates to go down. // Couples in their early and middle 20 ' s , who since World War II have provided the bulk of first-time home buyers , are shopping but , for the most part , are not buying in many communities , according to builders. // Older homeowners who desire a larger or fancier house , whom real estate agents call " move up " buyers and who have generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not returned to the marketplace in large numbers , according to sales brokers. // Sales of new single-family houses rose 38 percent in October compared with July , according to Government figures released this month . Resales of single-family homes rose 8. 8 percent in November from the previous month , according to industry figures , and there was a 27 percent increase in home construction starts in November. // That was the largest rise of a geographically spotty recovery that began in late August after the nation ' s longest and deepest housing recession since World War II. // But builders and other housing specialists emphasized that it was a tenuous and vulnerable recovery , linked to falling interest rates , and that so far it was nothing like the kind of robust buying that many economists say is necessary to help lead the country out of the recession. // Home prices and mortgage rates are still too high for many would-be buyers , they say , and as long as the national unemployment rate is in double-digit numbers it will pose a psychological deterrent to a strong recovery. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market , " Joseph Franks , a sales manager for Orrin Thompson Homes in Minneapolis , said , " but there is still a deep concern about the general economy , despite the good news of lower interest rates . " <> <> Need to Find Buyers // Morever , many real estate specialists said that mortgage rates had not fallen enough to help people sell their present houses , a development that , many housing economists say , is necessary for a sustained revival of the market for new homes. // After hovering at more than 16 percent nationally for more than two years , the interest rate for conventional home mortgages has dropped to about 14 percent , and the rate for Government-insured Federal Housing Administration loans has declined to 12 percent . In a few cities , conventional loans are being offered for less than 13 percent. // Builders and real estate brokers interviewed in several cities estimated that their monthly sales average increased more than 20 percent since September. // " This was the best November in our history , " said Joseph Schiller , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered for less than $90 , 000 was selling as soon as it was listed , he said. // Mr. Schiller estimated that about 80 percent of the buyers were two-salary couples who generally were about three years older than first-time home buyers in the past . Brokers elsewhere reported a similar pattern. // Richard Wilkes , an executive of North American Mortgage Company in Houston , said he had seen a " phenomenal " increase in loan applications. // The greatest increases in home sales were reported in the Southwest , the South and the Washington , D.@C. , metropolitan area ; the smallest were in the industrial Middle West. // In the New York metropolitan area , builders and real estate brokers reported that the declining mortgage rates had begun to stimulate more sales but that there had not been a broad turnaround in the industry . <> <> Interest Rates a Factor // Virtually everyone interviewed who had purchased a home recently said that the decline in rates had been a major factor in the decision to buy. // " We decided to buy quickly , almost on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , with her husband , Richard , a Ralston-Purina executive , recently bought a three-bedroom condominium in Atlanta for $100 , 000 . When interest rates declined , she said , it " seemed like a good time. " // Jon and Aprille Meek , who are television producers in Houston , said they first looked for a home when they were married 18 months ago , but as interest rates continued to rise " we decided to wait for a while , " Mr. Meek said , // Finally they decided several weeks ago to buy a $90 , 000 town house in southwestern Houston under a variable-rate mortgage with an initial interest rate of less than 11 percent . The rate can be increased in the future. // Despite the improvement , many builders and sales agents said that high prices for new homes and caution rooted in the nation ' s troubled economy were still discouraging potential buyers. // " Things have really popped loose " in the last month , said Richard Nelson , sales manager of the Nellie Gail Ranch development in Orange County . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we ' re all the way there yet . I think some people are waiting for interest rates to come down even more . If the interest rates don ' t go down any more we could come to a complete standstill again. " //
