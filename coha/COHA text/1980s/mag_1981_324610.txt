The Reaganauts cast a more favorable eye toward mergers <P> When the U.S. Government began bashing business monopolies , or near monopolies , around the turn of the century , the targets were big , bad and mean , and they existed in almost every basic industry . Standard Oil controlled 84% of U.S. oil marketing , competitors to American Tobacco were mere puffs of smoke and United States Steel was an incredible amalgam of 148 companies that dwarfed runners-up . Washington 's vigorous trustbusters lashed out against a variety of anticompetitive practices : Hollywood studios ' control of movie theaters , Eastman Kodak 's grip on film processing and United Shoe Machinery 's knot on shoe manufacturing equipment . <P> But in the past decade or so , the trustbusters seem to have run out of clearly evil dragons to slay . The fact that bigness is not necessarily bad also seems to be sinking in . Indeed , bigness can boost U.S. competitiveness abroad . Richard McLaren , chief of the Justice Department 's antitrust division in the early Nixon years , is widely regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Jimmy Carter , no new major antitrust cases were filed . <P> Now the early signs indicate that the Reagan Administration will continue the lassitude in antitrust action . During his confirmation hearing in March , Reagan Antitrust Chief William Baxter , a Stanford law professor , strongly hinted that he would not meddle in such deals as Standard Oil of California 's $4 billion bid to buy Amax , a producer of molybdenum and specialty metals , Standard Oil of Ohio 's decision to buy Kennecott Copper for $1.8 billion , or Arco 's purchase in 1977 of the Anaconda Co . The mere mention of such mergers between natural-resource giants would have set an oldtime trust-buster 's blood boiling , and even Baxter conceded that his agency would act if the combinations turned out to be blatantly anticompetitive . But then he softened his stance by saying that there would be no interference if the mergers were only " the efficient movement of funds from a cash-rich company to a company with serious investment needs . " That is precisely the grounds for most recent energy mergers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division 's 13-year-old guidelines on mergers in a way to permit more corporate couplings . He says he does not believe in putting more " weight in the saddlebags of the faster runners . " In other areas , the Reaganauts seem to be giving the green light to practices that have previously been regarded as anticompetitive , or nearly so . One of the most important is that the U.S. may allow American companies to form joint ventures for doing international business . That would make U.S. firms more competitive with foreign enterprises , which have long been permitted to engage in such ventures . <P> The Reagan Administration , though , will continue fighting several big antitrust cases that have been pending for years . The case against International Business Machines has been droning on since the first papers were filed on the final working day of the Johnson Administration in January 1969 . Last week , with IBM still preparing its surrebuttal to the Government 's rebuttal , Baxter said : " I do n't think it was well handled by the Government , or IBM , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
