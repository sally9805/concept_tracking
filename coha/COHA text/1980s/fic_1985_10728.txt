off , providing I let her make it up to me during the week . Maybe it was the prospect of spending the whole afternoon with her kids that brought that light to her eyes . Mothers are peculiar . " Get going , " I said , propelling her toward the door . " And stop worrying . A whole day with Martha is n't going to kill me . It may reduce me to babbling idiocy , but it wo n't kill me . . . Just kidding , Shirley . Go , leave , vamoose . " She lingered , pulling on her gloves . White gloves ! " Miz Danner will sit with Miz Martha while she naps ... " " I know . Run along . Depart . Take your leave . " " And the Judge will be here this evening . It 's his day . " " Who 's the Judge ? " " I knew I forgot to tell you something . That 's Miz Martha 's lawyer . He 's a very old friend of hers and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private , so you can sneak off and have a little time to yourself . " I meditated a ribald remark , but decided it would be tasteless . " I suppose I bring out the sherry . " " She 'll tell you what to do . " " I 'm sure she will . " " You ca n't go wrong with the Judge , " Shirley assured me . " He'sII a real gentleman . You 'll like him . Everybody likes Mr. McLendon . " She finally left . I squared my shoulders and gritted my teeth andwent up to Martha . She seemed brighter that morning . There was no doubt in my mind that she was getting better . Old fuss-budget Green was right , sooner or later she would have another stroke ; nothing can prevent the inevitable when the patient is eighty-five . But I was beginning to think that it would be later rather than sooner . Or was Green giving Matt , not a medical diagnosis , but what he thought Matt wanted to hear ? If Matt shed tears at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could hardly wait to get his hands on the property . With Martha , feeling livelier was synonymous with feeling meaner . She kept nodding off , but every time I stopped reading her eyes would snap open and a growl would remind me to continue . The fourth time she woke from a pleasant doze to demand that I go on reading , I rebelled . I had been at it for two solid hours and Esther was more revolting than ever . She had just welcomed her former lover back to England and was rejoicing over the fact that he seemed to be very sorry for her.  |p71When  Martha croaked , " Go on , " I shut the book . " You 've been struggling to keep awake for half an hour , " I said . " I 'm going to see about lunch . " Martha snarled at me , and I went on , firmly , " If I do n't do somethingbefore Mrs. Danner gets here , she 'll dish up some revolting mess . How would you like a nice juicy hamburger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam of greed replaced the gleam of outraged malice in Martha'seyes . ( It 's a subtle difference , but I could tell . ) " Good , " I said . " I 'll be back in fifteen minutes . " I had the salad made by the time Mrs. Danner arrived . I was very tactful ; I told her I was taking over the cooking because I thought she had too much to do , even though she was a better cook than I . . . It was wasted effort . She did n't care . She did n't appear to care about much . I took Martha 's lunch up and fed it to her . She grumbled at my awkwardness . She had cause  --  I was n't very good at it ; but she would have grumbled anyway , so I did n't take her criticism to heart . Her appetite was excellent ; she ate every scrap . I hoped the food had mellowed her , but when I started to assist with the more intimate needs her helplessness demanded , she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the afternoon off , " I said , interpreting the gist of her complaints without difficulty . Martha never used profanity , not even a teeny damn or hell . She did n't have to . I got the idea : I was an officious , interfering brat , and I had no right to decide what Shirley 's duties should be . I interrupted the tirade , principally because I was afraid she was hurting herself . " Might is right , Martha . I 'm in charge now . When you get back on your feet , you can kick me down the stairs and out the door . My advice to you is to conserve your strength so that that happy day is quick to arrive . Now . I 'll just lift you up and slip this in . . . Oh , sorry . I 'll improve with practice . " It was not a pleasant time for either of us , but I finally got her washed up and tucked in and settled down . She looked exhausted . I felt guilty about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I offered to read her to sleep . " How about some Milton ? " I offered . " God in him for her , and that sort of thing . " She shook her head . " Talk , " she mumbled . " Mother ? "  |p72It  was the first time she had indicated any interest in my maternal parent  --  her daughter . I sat down on the side of the bed and started talking . Told her about Mother 's job and her recent promotion , about her apartment , about her friends and her arthritis and so on . Martha seemed to enjoy it  --  at least she did n't stop me  --  so I went on , and told her about me . Med school was rough but I thought I was keeping up ; my grades were good , and I had had a halfhearted compliment from one of the professors . After a while she interrupted . " Bows ? " I could n't figure out what she meant at first . My failure to comprehendbrought a faint flush of rage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand and jabbed at the third finger that the light dawned . " Beaux ? " I repeated . " Boyfriends ? One or two . I 'm not engaged , no . Nothing serious . I do n't intend to tie myself down until I finish school . " Martha stared at me without blinking . The drooping eyelid and the slight twist of her mouth turned her expression into a cynical leer . She said , quite clearly , " Judge coming . " " I know , Shirley told me . I 'll break out the sherry . And shall I make some hors d'oeuvres ? " " Bring here . " " Okay . " " Change ... dress . Look decent . " I glanced at my faded shirt and jeans . " All right . " " Some respect .. . Manners ... " " I said , all right . " " Sleep now . " She closed her eyes . She had outscored me again . She was n't interested in Mother 's life , or in mine ; it had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was still unsought and undesired  --  not a beau to my string . Then the curt orders , the kind she 'd have given a servant .. . It was such a petty way of getting back at me , not so much for my clumsiness in helping her as for the fact that she needed help . I should have pitied her . I did n't . But I did not feel humiliated . She had lost the power to hurt me . I had left part of the salad for Mrs. Danner , but she had n't touched it . When I went to the kitchen she was finishing a thick sandwich made of cheese and bread  --  no lettuce , no tomato , no nothing . She started guiltily to her feet when I entered . " Take your time , " I said.  | " I was goin ' to clean the parlor . " " I 'll clean the parlor . If you 've finished , go up and sit with Miss Martha . " She began gathering up the luncheon dishes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on upstairs . I have to go out for half an hour or so , but I wo n't be long . " She turned , alarm written plainly across her drab features . " I don ' like to be alone with her . What if somethin ' happens ? " " Then you pick up the phone and call the doctor . Nothing is going to happen , Mrs. Danner . I 'll be back in half an hour  --  an hour at the most . " " But I don ' like  --  " " Do n't be silly . The doctor 's phone number is on the pad by the telephone . So is Shirley 's . She 's home today . Run along . " I could hardly blame her for her reluctance . I too would rather have scrubbed floors or cleaned privies than sit with Martha . Did she insist that Mrs. Danner read aloud to her  --  T.S . Eliot , perhaps , or Dostoevski ? After I had rinsed the dishes , I went to the back door . The dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sense enough to tie him up or confine him when he came for his breakfast . Shirley 's veterinarian had agreed to meet me at her office at one . There was no point in my going unless I had the dog with me . I could n't even call him . I did n't know what to call him . Finally I got one of my brighter ideas . I put some of his dry food in a dish and went out on the back step and rattled it , calling softly . It was , perforce , an anonymous call . " Here , dog  --  come on , dog . " It was probably the sound and smell of the food , rather than my voice , that attracted him . In daylight he had lost the confidence he had demonstrated the night before . He came skulking , tail low , eyes wary . I did n't know much about dogs . I could n't tell one breed from another . He had long drooping ears and a low-slung body that ought to have been heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was either very nearsighted or very absent-minded , because after a few feet of slow forward progress he finally recognized me ; then his tail started flapping and he advanced more quickly . While he gulped the food I tied a scarf around his neck . He came with me readily and climbed into the front seat of the car as if he knew what was going on.  |p74It  was my first visit to Carrsville in years . The town had not changed much . A sign on the outskirts reminded me that the populationwas 1350 . The houses on the main street  --  the only street  --  looked as if they had n't been painted since I left . There was one block of commercial establishments  --  two gas stations , a grocery store , a drugstore , a five-and-ten . The visit convinced me of one thing  --  except for the vet , there was absolutely no reason for me to return to Carrsville . I had wondered how a woman veterinarian could establish a practice in an area like this , where macho traditions prevailed and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw May Rubin I understood . She was about six feet tall and must have weighed a hundred and ninety pounds , most of it muscle . Those brawny arms could easily hobble a cow or throw a sheep  --  if that 's what you 're supposed to do with cows and sheep . Her graying hair was cropped short , and she had not bothered with makeup . Her eyes were gray too ; they appraised me , without prejudice , from behind her horn-rimmed glasses . I started to tell her how much I appreciated her coming in to work on Sunday . She shrugged the speech away with the air of a person who has no time and little sympathy for meaningless courtesies . " Let 's see what you 've got here , " she said . I drove back to Maidenwood half an hour later and sixty dollars poorer . Rabies shot , distemper shot , parvo shot , penicillin shot , bottlesof pills , ointment , flea shampoo ... I had the feeling that I was in much deeper than I had expected . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat beside me , with a distinctly proprietorial air . I also had a little book called " How to Care for Your Dog . " When May realized I was as ignorant about the canine species as I claimed , her contempt turned to pity . She even presented me with an old collar one of her clients had left behind . My brain was reeling with new information . The dog was a mixed breed  --  part hound , part shepherd , part God-knew-what . He would always limp ; several of the small bones in his paw had been broken and they had already started to knit , badly . It would require a painful and expensive operation to put them right , and May saw no point in doing so . She supposed I did n't care whether he ever won any prizes catching rabbits ? I assured her that was not one of my aspirations . So , she said , all we had to worry about was the infection . Make sure he had his pills twice day , use the ointment four times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , de-flea him , worm him .. . I groaned aloud . The dog glanced at me and flapped his tail sympathetically , but he did n't appear at all embarrassed at putting me to so much trouble . I do n't know how he knew , but he did ; anybody who has spent sixty hard-earned bucks on a dog owns that dog . I drove around to the back and left the car in the yard . The dog curled up on his rug and prepared for a well-deserved nap . He had yelped once or twice while May was cleaning and disinfecting his foot , but he had not snapped at her . I told him he was a good dog . I 'd have to think of a name for him . Could n't keep calling him " dog . " The trip had taken longer than I anticipated , but I figured I had another half hour before Martha woke up . I browned the roast , poured a generous dollop of wine over it , and set the burner to simmer . Martha still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast would be easier to chew than oven roast . That only took ten minutes . I was about to sit down for a rest when I remembered I had promised Mrs. Danner I would tidy the parlor . It should n't take long ; no one had been in the room since Friday , and I had carried the used wineglasses to the kitchen that evening . As I approached the room I saw the door was open . Mrs. Danner must have been a little deaf . I stood in the doorway for several seconds before she realized I was there . She started and turned . Her hands were empty , but there was a can of furniture polish and a dustcloth on the table . " I thought I told you to stay with Miss Martha , " I said . " She 's asleep . I was gon na  --  " " Please go back upstairs . " " I was  --  " " I said I 'd clean this room . Go on , please . Tell me when she wakes . " She obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like someone expecting a blow . She was so damned humble and Uriah-Heepish she made me feel guilty ; but what the devil was she there for , if not to relieve Shirley and me in watching over Martha ? Not that the house could n't have used a full-time housemaid ; in its heyday , it must have had a large staff . But there had been no attempt to maintain the old standards , just keep a few rooms habitable . And why , if the idea of being in the same room with Martha terrified her so , had she accepted the job ?  |p76I  knew the answer , of course . She had accepted it because she needed the money . I ought to know ; I had done a lot of things I detested for the same reason . The table on which she had been about to operate was mahogany , with the soft reddish patina of age . I picked up the can of polish . It was one of those spray jobs , and even I knew you are n't supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special polish on hers , together with a lot of elbow grease . Actually , the furniture did n't need polishing , only dusting . I rather doubted that Mrs. Danner had intended to polish anything . She had been looking at some object , and it was n't hard to figure out what that object was . It lay on the table , where she had dropped it when she heard me at the door  --  one of the letters Alan had brought to show Matt , in order to make his point about the need for protection from trespassers . The rest of the letters were there too . I could see Matt stubbornly refusing to look at them , and Alan stubbornlyrefusing to take them back . I had n't noticed them when I cleared away the wineglasses . I was a little surprised that Mrs. Danner would be curious enough to examine the peculiar documents . I gathered the papers and took them to a chair by the window . The one she had been inspecting was the letter I had read  --  the difficult , childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were half a dozen others . They had nothing in common except the craziness of their contents . One , on scented pink notepaper with fancy gold initials , offered the services of the writer to " Professor Alan " in terms that left the extent of those services wide open . She had seen his picture in the newspaper and she just knew they would have an awful lot in common . Another , neatly typed on business stationery with a printed letterhead , was from an organizationnamed The Research Center for Psychic Archaeology . It requested  --  perhapsdemanded would be more accurate  --  permission to excavate at Maidenwood , at a location that had been revealed to the writer during a seance . A third offered to sell Alan a map showing the exact spot where Blackbeard had buried his treasure . The price was a mere ten thousand dollars  --  no personal checks , please , only cash or certified check . The others were even more exotic . If these were a sample of Alan 's mail , I wondered what kind of trash Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter writers and their ilk were givenp77to prowling the fields and forests of Maidenwood by night . Someone had done so  --  someone with a very unpleasant sense of humor . I lavished a few silent but passionate adjectives upon my cousin Matt . He might have had the decency to warn me about this feature of the job . However , to give him his due , he probably never thought of it as constituting a potential danger . He had very little imagination . I , on the other hand , probably had too much . I picked up the letters and went in search of Mrs. Danner . She was in the kitchen , motionless as a monolith , staring at the door . The dog stared back at her , eyes pleading , nose pressed against the screen . I poked her . " Mrs. Danner  --  " She pointed . " It 's a dog . " " I know . " " I 'll run him off . " " You 'll do nothing of the kind . It 's my dog . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a while back . " " Beekins must be a real charmer , " I said . Mrs. Danner transferred her glazed stare to me . " Anyhow , he 's my dog now , " I said firmly . " You need n't have anything to do with him . Just leave him alone . " " Miz Martha wo n't have no animals around the place . " " Miss Martha wo n't know unless you tell her . And , " I added , " if you do , it will be your fault if she has another stroke . Clear ? " Mrs. Danner stared . " Okay , " I said . " If you get bored you can  --  you can dust the parlor . Do n't use that polish , just a dustcloth . Got it ? " Mrs. Danner stared . Martha was too dignified to yell for me ; had that not been the case , I 'd have heard her at the bottom of the stairs . She had plenty to say once I had made my appearance . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinking about that , " I said . " You 're so much better , I do n't believe you need constant attendance . You must be sick of people around all the time . Oh , I do n't mean you would be left alone in the house ; but if I could get Matt to install a bell , like they have in a hospital . . . Would n't you like that ? " She indicated she would think about it . I smothered a smile as I went about my nursing duties , because I knew she was considering pros and cons I had not mentioned . The idea of pressing a buzzer and bring her slaves running , panting and puffing , from far corners of the house , had its appeal.  |p78I  flattered myself that I was rather deft in tidying her up that time , but she was n't satisfied . She wanted her hair brushed and arranged , she wanted her new bedjacket  --  not that one , the other one  --  no , not that one ... she wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cologne . Her vanity was a little pathetic and more than a little grotesque . It is hard to believe when you are still firm-fleshed and unwrinkled that you will ever be old ; yet I think the pathos would have outweighed the grotesque with anyone except Martha . When I had finished the job she glowered at me . I knew what she was going to say . My only defense was to beat her to the punch . " I 'll run and change now , " I said . " I did n't have time before . " She nodded grudgingly . THE JUDGE WAS EARLY . I WAS ON MY WAY UPSTAIRS WITH THE PLATE OF " hors d'oeuvres "  --  crackers and cheese  --  when I heard his car ; but it was n't that sound that made me drop the plate onto the nearest piece of furniture , and bolt for the door . It was the sound of a dog barking . However , the dog was easily seduced . When I went out , he was sprawled on the ground , squirming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip of a gold-headed cane . The Judge was a handsome old man . He had probably not been handsome when he was young ; sagging muscles and loosened skin had blurred and softened features that might have appeared too bold , even coarse , thirty years earlier . He had a beautiful mop of snowwhitehair , brushed back from a high forehead , and he looked as if he had dressed for a wedding  --  dark gray three-piece suit , white shirt , silk tie . When he saw me , his eyes widened . " Julie ? " There was a questioning note in his voice . I said , smiling , " I suppose I 've changed . " " Yes . Yes , I thought for a moment . . . The family resemblance is very strong . " I decided not to pursue that subject . I definitely did not want to be told that I reminded him of Martha.  |p79He  had to make a wide circle around the dog , who was staring admiringly at him . " A fine animal , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began biting furiously at its flank . By now I knew what that meant . " I 'm afraid he has fleas , " I said . " A fine hound , " the Judge repeated . " What is his name ? " It must have been the word " hound " that put the idea into my head . Normally I am more inventive . " Elvis , " I said . " Elvis ? " " Elvis . " The stupid dog stared off into space , paying no attention . " Elvis , " I repeated loudly . " Good dog , Elvis . You can go and  --  er  --  do whateverdogs do ... " Elvis continued to gaze raptly into the infinite , so I gave up . " Do come in , " I said , opening the door . " Martha is looking forward to seeing you . " " And I her . But first , may I have a word with you ? " I led the way into the parlor . He waited for me to take a chair before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began . I should have known he would have to go through the formalities first . If the house had been ablaze he would have asked after Mother before he yelled " Fire . " We established that Mother was fine and I was fine before he got down to business . " I fear you found Martha sadly changed . " " Actually , I think she 's doing remarkably well . " " Do you ? " A glow of pleasure warmed his sallow cheeks . " I am delighted to hear it . Dr. Green has not been encouraging . " " He 's the doctor , " I said quickly . " I mean , do n't take my word for anything . I would n't want to raise false hopes , since I do n't know what I 'm talking about . I was just giving you an inexpert opinion . " " You are being modest . " He smiled approvingly ; modesty was a proper attribute for nice young women . " I did not want an expert opinion , I wanted encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sure he is . However , I ca n't help wondering why Martha is not in a hospital  --  a city or university medical center , with up-to-date facilities . I 'm in a difficult position . Dr. Green has n't volunteered any information , and I can hardly ask questions without sounding like some smart .. . like some smart-aleck med student . "  | " You have the right to ask any questions you like . But it is n't Dr. Green 's fault that Martha is here . He recommended the University of Virginia hospital . Martha refused . " " I can understand her feelings , " I began . " You ca n't really understand , " the Judge said gently . " You are too young . Old age is , above all else , ignominious . One by one our strengths are stripped away . Arthritis and rheumatism cripple our limbs , hearing and vision diminish , beauty fades ... Martha is clinging to the only shred of dignity remaining to her  --  the right to die in her own home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies in many sterile rooms  --  addressed as " mother " by impertinent interns who ca n't be bothered to remember her name , and as " dear " by nurses young enough to be her grandchildren . . . " " I do understand . I 'm sure I 'll feel the same way when my turn comes . But you must admit the situation places a considerable responsibilityon my shoulders . Shirley is first-rate , one could n't ask for a better nurse ; but she is not a young woman , and we are so far away from help if an emergency should arise  --  " " Yes , I see . You must be nervous here alone , especially at night . " " I am not nervous . I am understandably concerned . We are isolated , and some peculiar things have happened . " " Is that why you got the dog ? " " I did n't get the dog , he got me . But I do feel better with him here . I know Martha hates animals  --  " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pet , " I said . I had not meant to say it . It made me sound sullen and childish . " Martha does n't hate dogs . She had a dog , long ago  --  a beautiful hound named Jason . Her father gave him to her on her twelfth birthday , and she had him for over ten years . She found him deadshot  --  onemorning , and it almost broke her heart . She vowed then that she would never own another pet . " Moisture sparkled in the corners of his eyes . Poor dear old man , he found the story touching . But I could n't agree with the idea of cutting oneself off from love because of the fear of losing it . " I did n't know that , " I said gently , but noncommittally . " Martha does n't know about the dog  --  Elvis  --  and I do n't intend to tell her unless I have to . But if she refuses to go to a hospital she must accept the consequences . Do n't you agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures ? "  |p81The  Judge began , " A gun  --  " I laughed . " I 'd probably shoot myself in the foot , Judge . Besides , I do n't want to kill some harmless screwball , just scare him away . " It was the second reference I had made to the neighborhood sensation . Again Judge McLendon tiptoed delicately away from the subject . " You are a very persuasive young woman , Julie . And a very sensible one . I am much more at ease about Martha 's safety now that I have talked with you , and I am in complete agreement with your arguments . I had better go upstairs now , if you will excuse me . " He pushed himself to his feet , with the help of the cane . Then he winked . " I wo n't mention  --  er  --  Elvis , " he whispered . I GOT TO THE KITCHEN IN TIME TO PREVENT MRS . DANNER FROM DUMPINGa quart of water onto the roast . I splashed in more wine ; as I turned to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but at the bottle , with an expression I could not mistake . The only thing that surprised me was my own obtuseness . I should have known , the day she had been so eager to take the wineglasses , one of which was more than half full . Well , I did n't begrudge her an occasional nip . If I were married to born-again Joe Danner , I 'd have taken to the bottle myself . " You can run along if you like , " I said . " Mr. Danner 's not here yet . " " Suit yourself . But I ca n't think of anything else for you to do . Unless you 'd like to read the rest of those letters . " In detective stories a sudden , unexpected accusation produces a guilty start , or a guilty blush , or a guilty something . Mrs. Danner just stared blankly . I elaborated . " The crank letters . The letters on the table in the parlor . " " I was n't reading nothing . I was dusting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose a phrase in one of them caught your eye . They were peculiar letters . " " I was n't reading nothing . " I shrugged . " Go on , then . Sit on the step and wait for Mr. Danner , if you ca n't think of anything else to do . "  |p82She  could n't . Elvis was at the back door , ears up and tail flapping . I had not had time to read my manual on dog care , but I had a feeling I was n't supposed to feed him four times a day . I decided the hell with it . He was too thin anyway . I slipped a pill in his food and rubbed ointment on his foot while he gobbled his dinner . The fleas hopped merrily up and down on his back . I thought I 'd bathe him in the morning , after I had studied the manual . No need to be precipitate about such things . Mr. Danner duly arrived , just as the grandfather clock in the hall struck five . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side staring straight ahead , not speaking . American Gothic on wheels . I wondered if they ever spoke to one another , beyond the basic remarks dictated by common needs ; and if they did , what they talked about . Not their children . Perhaps they read aloud to one another from the Bible , with particular attention to doomsday prophecies . How much of a fanatic was Joe Danner ? He was fanatical enough to disown his daughter and alienate his son . A man like that might feel duty-bound to write threatening letters to blasphemers and heretics . It would n't have surprised me to learn that Joe had penned the letter his wife had been examining ; but was he crazy enough to fall upon the heretics with fire and the sword ? I certainly hoped not . But I found myself unwillingly remembering a movie I had been fool enough to see with a friend who was an aficionado of horror films , the bloodier the better . This film had featured an insane handyman who did in a dozen people with various tools  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with special effects these days . Blood spouted , heads fell off , arms and legs littered the terrain . I could see Joe Danner , in his faded dungarees , coming up the stairs at Maidenwood , brandishing an ax .. . Nonsense . If Joe decided to exterminate anyone , it would be Alan , who was planning to desecrate graves . Comforted by this reasoning , I went back to the kitchen and had a drink . I WAS WAITING IN THE PARLOR WHEN I HEARD MARTHA 'S DOOR OPENand Judge McLendon descend.  | " I hope I have n't tired her , " he said , as soon as he saw me . " She 'd like you to come up now . " " I 'm sure it did her good to see you . " " I 'll run along now . Please telephone me at any time , day or night , if there is anything at all I can do . " The visit had certainly not pepped him up . He looked ten years older than he had when he arrived  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might appear to have improved , but her condition must seem pitiable to an old friend who remembered her in her vigorous youth  --  especially a friend who knows that only good luck or the Grace of God has preserved him from a similar fate . Martha had n't much to say that evening , but she never took her eyes off me . She did n't scare me  --  not any longer  --  but that bright , unwinking glare would have affected anyone 's nerves . I handed her over to Shirley with enormous relief . Another neglected duty was nagging at me , and I decided to get it over with . I had forgotten to buy stamps , and I owed Mother a call . She had written once , a conventional note hoping I was not finding my duties too onerous , but I knew she would n't use the phone unless she was desperate . Long distance , to her , was not a convenience but a last resort . She said she had been hoping I would call . " Such a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called me , you know . " " Oh , honey , I 've just been so busy . Work is frantic , you 've no idea . " I laughed at the complacent enjoyment in her voice . She loved the frantic schedule and the compliments that followed her achievements . " I do n't know how you keep so calm , Mrs. Newcomb . I do n't know what we 'd do without you . " " I wish I could say the same , Mother . I had anticipated being driven crazy by Martha , but I did n't realize it would be so damn boring . " " How is she getting on ? " " I am sorry to report that the patient is recovering nicely , " I said . Mother had a way of responding to particularly outrageous remarkswith pained silence . It was much more effective than a scolding , and usually ended with me scolding myself . " That was a terrible thing to say , " I offered . " Yes , honey , it was . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why does she hate me so much , Mother ? " Mother 's ladylike laugh was a little strained . " Now , Julie , you know she does n't like anyone , not even her own daughters . You must n't take it personally . " " It 's more than dislike . It 's active , malevolent ... When she looks at me I feel as if she is n't seeing me , but someone else  --  the child I used to be , perhaps . Was I that bad ? Lord knows I hated every second I spent in this house  --  " " Julie , I took you away the instant I could . It was impossible for me to have you with me at first . " The child I had been did n't believe that . As an adult , I could understand her reasons . She had had a desperate struggle at first , working at minimum wages during the day and going to secretarial school at night . Not impossible with a young child , but close to impossible , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in a bad neighborhood , drugs , child molesters ... I understood , yes , but I also wondered , with my grown-up wisdom , whether there had not been another factor , a kind of social snobbery , sometimes called pride , that made Mother refuse to have anyone , even me , see her until she had attained the goals she consideredminimal  --  a nice garden apartment in a pleasant suburb , a car , a good school for her daughter . I had never voiced any of my doubts to her , and God willing I never would . She went on protesting , excusing , anxiously demanding my acknowledgment that she had acted for the best . I cut her short . " Sure , Mother , I know . How 's the weather up there ? " Hot . The weather was hot . I said it had been raining here . Finally she said , " So Martha is better . Still bedridden , though ? Well , we ca n't expect miracles , can we ? " " No , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my farewells and hung up before she had that comment figured out , and before I had to admit it was a terrible thing to say.  |p85I  REPORTED FOR WORK THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON , TO BE RECEIVEDwith something less than enthusiasm . I did n't take it personally ; the weather was hot and muggy , and the open field swarmed with insects of all varieties . I could n't blame Alan for being in a glum mood , particularly since it was apparent that his new trial trenches had yielded nothing . ( I deduced this because a big young man was filling them in . ) " I came to tell you I ca n't come today , " I told Alan . Through the cloud of gnats that hovered around his nose he said , " Why not ? " " I have to wash my dog . " " Your dog , " Alan repeated . His lips barely parted ; whether he was controlling passionate emotion or trying to keep a bug from flying into his mouth I was not certain . " And see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time , voice and expression indicated rising interest . " Has something else happened ? " " Sorry to disappoint you . It 's about that other matter . " " Ah . Any new information ? " " I do n't know why it 's any of your business , but since there is no new information , I have no hesitation in informing you that such is the case . " After a moment , during which I decided there really was no reason for keeping the facts from him , I added , " He wants to know what to do with them . The bones . " " That is my business . " " Since when have you been the residuary legatee of all the miscellaneousbones found in this county ? " " Let me rephrase my remark . I have an interest in those bones . " He tossed his clipboard and pen onto a card table that had been set up to serve as an extremely temporary and portable office . " I 'll come with you . " I lied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But  --  " " I do n't want you either . " " But  --  " " I ca n't stand around here arguing with you . I 'm late . See you tomorrow . " I did n't look back . The big young man with the shovel stopped shoveling and gave me a hopeful " Hello " as I passed him . I smiled and went on . I had a drive of almost forty miles ahead of me , so I was n't lying when I said I was short on time . On back roads encumbered by slowmovingfarm machinery , it took an hour  --  ample time to think over what the sheriff had told me . I had been in the kitchen when the telephone rang . It was eightthirty , and breakfast cooled on the stove as the sheriff rambled on . He had called me by my first name . That did n't mean anything ; everybody in these parts called everybody by first names , unless prefixed by " Mr. " or " Miz " if the person addressed possessed the dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an underlying assumption , in the way he talked to me , that he knew me and expectedme to remember him . I did n't . It was beginning to worry me , how little I did remember from those years with Martha . It had not worried me before this visit because there was no reason for me to remember  --  no reason to think about that time . I had blotted out fourp87years of my life with a thoroughness that was rather unnerving . At any rate , he knew me , if I did n't know him , and he granted me a status I had not realized I possessed  --  that of resident relativein-charge . " I been tryin ' to reach Matt , " he said aggrievedly . " That boy is never in his office . " " It 's an election year . " " Yeah , well , it 's damn early to start campaignin ' . When I vote for a man I want him there workin ' , not ridin ' the roads lookin ' for more votes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , so I had no reason to placate him . " I have n't seen Matt since Saturday evening , and he did n't tell me what his plans were . Is there anything I can do ? " " Well , yeah , sure  --  that 's why I called . I got to do somethin ' with those damn bones , Julie . They ca n't lie around here forever . " " Oh . Those bones . " " You know the ones I mean . The ones that was found  --  " " I know the ones you mean . What do you want me to do about them ? " " It 's rightly Miz Martha 's responsibility . But I do n't want to bother her when she 's so poorly . I ca n't find Matt . So I figured you 'd be the one to speak for the family , or at least get them to make up their damn minds . " I could have told him it was not my responsibility , or my right , to decide anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back to Matt . Yes , I do . I was flattered at being asked to participate in a decision , instead of obeying orders , like hired help . With one eye on my congealed eggs , I said , " I 'll come to your office and talk to you about it . Would this afternoon suit you ? " He allowed as how it would , always providing he was not called away by a murder or an accident . I said I 'd take my chances ; we agreed on two o'clock . Apparently it was a quiet day for crime in the county . The sheriff was in his office , feet on the desk and cigar in his mouth , in approved county-sheriff style . He swung his feet off the desk when I appeared and rose , stubbing out the cigar . He was a little man . From the rumbling , grumbling voice that had vibrated over the telephone I had expected someone taller and heavier , with a beer belly hanging over his belt , like the caricaturep88sheriffs in the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have taken him for a barber or bank clerk . Thinning hair that had once been blond and was now an indeterminate shade halfway to gray framed a narrow , almost ascetic face , with lined cheeks and wide ingenuous blue eyes . " Well , now , it sure is good to see you again , Julie , " he said . " You sure have growed up to be a pretty girl . " He had known me back then . I had n't the faintest recollection of ever having seen him . I did n't say so ; I shook his hand and took the chair he indicated . He asked after my mother and I asked after his family  --  a photograph on the desk , of a little woman and three hulkingchildren , gave me the clue . " I really do n't know what I can tell you , " I began . " I tried to reach Matt this morning ; his secretary said he was in Washington and would n't be back till the end of the week . Surely he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not for a couple of weeks . See ... " He paused , studying me , and I realized that the baby-blue eyes were not as naive as they appeared . " How much do you know about this ? Did Matt talk to you ? Was it in the northern papers ? " " I do n't know much , " I admitted . " Only the bare facts and the reasonable assumptions one might draw from them . " " Reasonable assumptions . " Sheriff Jarboe looked as if he wanted to spit . " I 'm gon na tell you what the law says , not what some professorassumes . Human remains turn up , then the law 's got ta be notified . They turn up oftener than you might think  --  sewer lines , new roads , building sites  --  not to mention the damn archaeologists . Now if they turn up in the course of digging , whether it 's construction or something else , the professors can tell us how long they 've been in the ground . If they 're what you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they died ; but we do have to worry about what 's done with them . There are laws about disturbing Christian burials , and lately the Indian groups have stirred up a fuss about their people . So that 's one problem . Everybody raisin ' hell about what to do with the remains . " He reached for his cigar , then glanced at me . " Go ahead , " I said . " I think better with the damn thing in my mouth , " he said apologetically . " You have n't done badly without it , Sheriff . I see what you 're getting at . There is a problem of jurisdiction even with skeletons foundp89in situ . But in this case you ca n't even be sure whether they are  --  antiques , as you put it  --  or remains that might demand a criminal investigation . Right ? " Jarboe 's blue eyes narrowed . " There was a crime committed , no question about that . Those bones did n't walk out onto the road and lay down . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But near as I can tell , that was the only crime committed . There was no evidence of violence . I 've gone through the missing-persons files for thirty years back , and nobody fits the description . I do n't understand why the damn-fool professors ca n't tell me how old those bones are , but they say they ca n't . " " That 's the way it is , though . Soil conditions , type of burial  --  " " Yeah , well , I 've heard all that stuff . Point is , she must have been dead a long time or we 'd have some record in our missing-persons file . Without evidence of identity or criminal violence , I 've got no reason to keep the case open . I want to get her out of the morgue and back into the ground . The question is , where ? " " Why ask me ? " " Because  --  " He stabbed the air with his cigar . " Because that reasonable assumption you talked about suggests that she came from Maidenwood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of any reason why the jokers would carry those bones very far . If they 'd been left on somebody 's porch I 'd figure the comedians had a grudge against that person , but they could n't predict who would be the first one to drive that road . The doc says she was white  --  not Indian or nigra  --  so it 's possible she was an ancestor of yours . " " Are you suggesting the family cemetery at Maidenwood ? " " Any objections ? " " It 's okay with me . I ca n't imagine why Matt would object , but I 'll ask him . What do you need  --  some kind of legal document ? " " I 'm not sure what I need , " Jarboe mumbled , scratching his head . " But I ca n't move without the family 's permission . " " You have mine , for what it 's worth . I ca n't understand what all the fuss is about , to be honest . " " Yeah , well , most of the fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maidenwood . " " Alan ? " I leaned back in my chair . " What does he want you to do ? " " Wants me to give him the skeletons so he can study them . He acts like they were you know  --  pieces of wood . "  | " Sounds like him . He has n't actually seen the remains ? " " No . He barreled in here and pounded on the desk and ... Imaybe would have let him if he had n't been so damned high-handed , " Jarboe added , with a sheepish grin . " I know what you mean . " " Hell , he 's not even an anthropologist , " Jarboe said rather defensively . " We had a prof out here from UVA ; I did all the right things . You can see ' em if you want . " " Who , me ? " I said , startled . " I 'm not an anthropologist either . I could n't tell you anything you do n't already know . " " You are a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if somebody ought to go through the formalities . Course if it would upset you  --  " " It would not upset me . I just do n't know . . . Oh , well , why not ? " You have to be fairly hardened in the handling and viewing of cadavers to find yourself at ease in a morgue . More hardened than I was , at any rate . There 's a smell about such places , and a cold , hard , white look . I certainly was not upset , however . In fact , I had been annoyed by Jarboe 's assumption that I would come all over queer with faint feminine flutterings at the sight of a harmless old skeleton . I was not prepared for the emotion that seized me when Jarboe yanked out the drawer in which the bones had been placed . Never before had I been quite so conscious of the frailty of the inner structure that holds us upright . She had been a small woman . The soft ivory bones had a sculptural delicacy . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of bones . I was no expert , but I had attended a couple of seminars given by Kaufman , the " bone man " at Pennsylvania . He was a popular lecturer because he had served as consultantto the state police , and he had a repertoire of gruesome case histories . So I knew enough to observe some technical details . Such as the teeth . They were in excellent condition  --  no sign of caries or abscesses . No fillings , either . The absence of dental work would have made positive identification difficult , even if the missing-person files had come up with a possible candidate . The baby 's skeleton lay next to that of its presumed mother . Whether by design , or because the space was limited , it huddled close to her latticed rib cage . The bones were not so undamaged as hers ; the frail shell of the skull had not withstood the weight of earth . I assumed the pathologist had determined that the injuries were post/mortem . I assumed it because I had no intention of handling those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sign of distress , but Jarboe was determined I should react like a lady . He put a fatherly arm around me . " I should n't have let you look . " I shrugged off his support . " I 'm all right , " I said curtly . Jarboe closed the drawer . " I should n't have let you . Let 's go back to the office . I just might be able to scare up a little bourbon , strictly for medicinal purposes . " " The clothes , " I said , remembering my comments to Alan . " Could I see the clothes they were  --  er  --  wearing ? " " Yeah , sure . " The clothes had been wrapped in brown paper . Jarboe cleared his desk , pushing the accumulated debris to one side , and opened the package . Psychologists say the sense of smell is more evocative than any other sense . I do n't know why , or even whether it is true . But the faint aura surrounding those faded garments evoked images , and vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching across worn floor boards , hot closed-in air , dust tickling my nose , and a strong , distinctive odor .. . " Mothballs , " I said faintly . Jarboe nodded . " Yep . Stored away someplace , these were . I showed them around , nobody recognized them . Thought maybe they came from Maidenwood . " " I would n't know . There 's a lot of junk in our attic ; I used to poke around up there ... " Another shuddering jolt of recollection  --  but this one did n't drop neatly into place , it streaked through my mind and vanished . I did n't realize I was swaying gently to and fro , like a windblown weed , until Jarboe 's arm guided me to a chair . " There , now , " he said , not without satisfaction . " I knew I should n't have let you . Here , this 'll make you feel better . " I took the glass he pressed into my hand . The momentary faintnesswas gone , but I could n't deny him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smug . I assured him the liquor had indeed restored me , and brushed away his apologies . " I 'm only sorry I ca n't help you , Sheriff . I do n't remember ... " " Pity I ca n't ask Miz Martha . " " It 's not likely that they came from our attic , is it ? We 've hadp92trouble with trespassers , but I ca n't believe thieves could get into the house without leaving signs of forced entry . Shirley Johnson has been on duty ever since Martha became ill , and if anyone had broken in before that , Martha would have raised Cain . She was always a light sleeper , and she has ears like a hawk . " Jarboe nodded agreement . " Not to mention a double-barreled shotgun . I guess you 're right , Julie . If Martha had caught a burglar on the premises , she 'd have peppered him good . " " Martha has a gun ? " " Well , sure ; she always did , did n't she ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't seen it since I arrived . " " Better find it and keep it handy . " I stared at him in consternation and he added hastily , " In case of trespassers , and there 's rabid animals around ... You do n't need to worry about anyone getting into the house , you were one hundred percent right about that . Carrsville is a nice quiet little place , not like Pittsburgh . " A nice quiet little place inhabited by people who got a kick out of playing with human bones . The expression on my face convinced Jarboe he had better drop that argument . " Nothing familiar about the clothes , then ? " he asked . I picked up the dress . The calico was a drab print , small white figures on dark gray-blue ground . It looked as if it had been made at home , and by an unskilled seamstress ; the sleeves were unshaped tubes , the neck was high , unadorned by collar or frill , and the body of the dress fell straight and full from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " I said . " This was never made for her . It 's miles too big . " " That fits our reasonable assumption , " Jarboe said . " Somebody took this out of his mama 's attic . " " It 's maddening , " I muttered , examining the dress more closely . " I mean , there is absolutely nothing distinctive about this dress . It was made on a sewing machine , but women have been using them for  --  at least a hundred years , I suppose . The fabric does n't look like a synthetic and the print is old-fashioned , but these old prints are popular for quilts and country clothes . The style does n't tell me anythingbecause the dress has n't any style to speak of . " " Some old ladies in the country still wear dresses like this , " Jarboe agreed . " We thought of all that , Julie . " " It 's a hideous dress , " I said vehemently . " No girl that age would be caught dead in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunted . " Now this , " I went on , touching the folded white garment with my fingertip , " is altogether different . Handmade and probably old . " " Pick it up if you want , " Jarboe said , watching me . " Ca n't hurt it . " I did n't want to pick it up . The stains were probably rust but they looked like dried blood . I told myself I was acting like a fool and lifted the garment from the table . " Hand embroidery , " I said . " Every inch of it , all along the ruffles and frills . I think it 's what they call broderie anglaise . The fabric is lawn or batiste  --  I 'm not up on such things . All handmade . " I dropped the stained small dress onto the table . " No clue there either . Both boys and girls wore dresses like this years ago . If that matters ... " " Well , no , it does n't . Except people save things like this , handmade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heirloom . " " You can say that again . " I realized I was unconsciously wiping my fingers on my skirt . I put my hands in my pockets . " Sorry I ca n't be more help . " " You sure you wo n't have another nip ? " I had another nip . I needed it . I had not been able to conceal from Jarboe that I was " upset , " as he tactfully put it , but he did n't know how upset I had been  --  or why . It was n't good old-fashioned female squeamishness at the sight of a few bones . The skeletons had n't frightened or repelled me . They had only made me feel sad . But the clothes . . . Why could n't I pin down that flash of memory , as I had so many others once lost and unwanted ? My arguments as to why the clothes could not have come from Maidenwood were convincing , so far as they went . And I certainly did n't relish the idea that unknown persons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jarboe and left the building , but I still could n't get those pitiful garments out of my head . That baby 's dress , so lovingly and exquisitely made  --  and such a contrast to the woman 's dress . Well , but that did n't mean anything . Both garments must have been picked at random from a trunk of old clothes ; the mother who had fashioned that dainty gown would never have worn such a homely dress . As I drove out of the parking lot , I thought of something I should have realized earlier . The dress would not have been too big for a woman in the last months of pregnancy . After a quick stop at a supermarket to lay in more dog food ( myp94estimate of Elvis 's appetite had been wildly wide of the mark ) , I started back to Maidenwood . I was annoyed with myself for a number of reasons , and it did not improve my disposition to find that Mrs. Danner had made soup out of the stew-meat I had intended for supper . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package of frozen vegetables she had added to the pale gray broth had been reduced to mush , and the kitchen felt like a steam bath . I would have dashed upstairs to yell at her , but the sight of a flea-infested muzzle and two hopeful brown eyes peering in at the door reminded me of another duty . Why do dogs have such soulful eyes ? According to approved theology they have no souls . I took a dim view of approved theology  --  or I had always believed I did . So why was I so perturbed at the thought of the pitiful bones lying in a cold metal drawer ? Why were images of chanting priests and neat gravestones with " Here lies . . . " pressing at my mind ? I turned off the burner under the soup and filled a bowl with dog food . Elvis started whining at the sight of it , but before I took it out onto the porch I surreptitiously gathered my equipment , whisking around the kitchen with my back turned to the door so he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply immersed in his food before I carried the big washbasin and the brush and the flea shampoo and the towel and the kettle of hot water outside . Elvis did n't look up . Maybe he had never had a bath . He certainly looked as if he 'd never had a bath . I sat down on the step and rechecked the pertinent pages of " How to Care for Your Dog . " It did n't sound formidable : Put the water in the basin and the dog in the water . Five minutes later I was drenched from hair to sneakers . The only damp parts of Elvis were his paws . He stood a few feet away , grinning and wagging . Obviously he considered this a new and fascinatinggame  --  you pick me up and put me in the basin , then I jump out . The wetter you get , the more points for me . I was about to try again when Elvis turned and dashed off , roundingthe corner of the house at a good clip . He was back before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they had known one another all their lives . He had n't even barked . I said bitterly , " How sharper than a serpent 's tooth to have a faithless dog . " Alan acknowledged the witticism with a polite smile . " We met earlier . " " Oh ? "  | " Your cousin said I could investigate the smokehouse area . " " Oh . " " I think I 've located a rubbish dump . " " Gee , that 's wonderful . " " If your cousin would let us work there  --  " " Oh , come off it , Alan , you are n't really interested in the first manor house . You 're only interested in harassing Matt . I suppose , " I added , as Elvis squirmed unbecomingly at Alan 's feet , " you found some eighteenth-century steak bones in the trash . Or did you bring the wherewithal with which to bribe my dog ? " " He did n't need bribing . He 's a smart dog ; he recognized my charm and sterling character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , Alan ? " " I came to help you give the dog a bath , " Alan said . " Oh , to coin a phrase , yeah ? " " I figured you might have a little trouble . " Alan surveyed me from dripping hair to soggy sneakers , and grinned offensively . " You used to be terrified of dogs . " " 1 was not terrified of dogs . My mother was terrified of dogs . " " Anything you say . Come here , dog . " " His name is Elvis , " I said , in a more amiable tone . I am not too proud to accept help , and besides , I hoped Elvis would saturate Alan too . " Elvis ? Good God . " Alan grabbed the dog and popped him into the tub . The damned animal stood like a rock , with his tongue hanging idiotically out of his mouth . Alan got pretty wet , which soothed my ego somewhat . I decided it is not possible to bathe a dog without getting wet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dirt the instant he gets out of the tub , " Alan explained , taking a firm grip on Elvis 's collar . " Give me that towel ... Damn ! " I backed away out of the shower Elvis produced by vigorously shaking himself . " Oh , sorry , Alan . I 'm new to this . " " To coin a phrase , " Alan began . He showed me how to brush out the dead hair and dead fleas . Elvis loved that part of the process and I was able to return to a more pertinent topic of conversation . " You really came to find out what the sheriff said , " I remarked , watching with mild revulsion as Alan disposed of a few fleas whose stronger constitutions had resisted the shampoo.  | " What did he say ? " " He wants to get rid of the bones . Not , " I added , " give them to you . He pointed out that there are laws governing the disposal of human remains . " " Do n't I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family plot . " " I ca n't think of any reason why not . " " Neither can I , " Alan said agreeably . Elvis , lying on his side in blissful abandon , stiffened and started to squirm . " Hold on , I 'm not finished , " Alan said . " What 's the matter with him ? " " Now and then he remembers he 's supposed to be a watchdog . That sounds like Mr. Danner 's pickup . Damn it ; I thought Mrs. Dannerwould come to the kitchen before she left . I wanted to read her the riot act for making mush out of my dinner . " I realized after I had said it that it sounded suspiciously like a hint . Alan did n't take it up . He went on brushing , and I said , " Why are n't you looking for burial sites ? " " What makes you think I 'm not ? " " In the middle of a pasture that 's under water a good part of the year ? " Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been taking archaeology courses , or can it be that the pearls of wisdom I dropped all those years ago  --  " " It 's just common sense . You 're looking for evidence of occupation , not for vandalized graves . " " The two are not incompatible . " " In this case they are . The settlement at Maydon 's Hundred dates from the first quarter of the seventeenth century . I saw the skeletons . They are too clean and well preserved to be that old . " " I know . " " How do you know ? You have n't seen the skeletons . " " Perkins , the pathologist , is a friend of mine . Anyway , I knew as soon as I read the story in the newspaper that the bones could n't be three hundred and fifty years old . Unless ... " " Unless what ? " Alan might not have heard me . He released the dog , who promptly flung himself into the nearest patch of dirt , and rolled . Sitting crosslegged , hands resting lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were visualizing the scenes he described.  | " It 's hard to imagine what it was like for them . Tangled wildernessas far as the eye could see , none of the comforts , even the necessities , they had always taken for granted . Elizabeth the First had been dead only a few years . James was king  --  that sour-faced Scot who amused himself with handsome young men and solemn researchesinto witchcraft . The men who landed at Jamestown wore ruffs and swords ; they boasted of being ' gentlemen , ' too good to dirty their hands clearing land or building houses . The settlement almost died because of their gentility .. . " But it survived . Towns grew up ; the Hundreds sent representativesto the Assembly at Jamestown . There were seventy-eight peopleat Maydon 's Hundred in 1622 . They had built homes , and a church , all clustered around the fort they believed would intimidate the ' savages . ' The Indians were n't intimidated . The uprising of 1622 wiped out one third of the Virginia colonists . Maydon 's was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction so complete , that no attempt at resettlement was ever made . For years afterward , hunters camping near the site swore that the spirits of the dead crowded around them in the darkness , baring their bloody wounds and wailing for vengeance in thin , high voices . The spot was shunned , its very location forgotten . Maydon 's became ' the lost Hundred . ' I had heard it before , but the spell of his voice was as strong as ever . Even the dog lay still , his head on his paws , his liquid brown eyes fixed on the speaker . " But they say she still lingers in the green shadows of the forest , " Alan went on softly . " Not as a mutilated victim but in all her youthful beauty . Raven-haired and blue-eyed , gems at her throat and in her hair , long velvet skirts rustling the dead leaves  --  " The spell was broken . I sat up as if I had been stung . " You 're wasting your talents in archaeology , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That story is a romantic novel . I read it , To Have and to Hold , by Mary Johnston . One of those fatuous sentimental old-fashioned  --  " " Sure it is , " Alan said . " Pure fiction . The high-born lady , fleeing a hated marriage with the king 's favorite , disguising herself as one of the servant girls the Virginia Company had recruited as wives for the settlers . But there 's a germ of fact behind that story ; there was a Lady Jocelyn Cartwright among the residents of Maydon 's Hundred  --  " " You told me that five years ago . Alan , I understand why May/don 's is important . So little has survived from those first settlements  --  only a few have been located , much less excavated . But your fantasy about the Lady was what ruined your article . Every scholar in the field ridiculed it ; it almost wrecked your career . She never existed . " " She wrote to the king . There was a letter . " " Then where is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a collection of family papers , was one of those dilettante **27;13505;TOOLONG . He probably made it up . " Alan refused to be provoked . He gave me a sweet , lazy smile and said cheerfully , " You 've seen the portrait . " I had not seen the original . It was in the National Portrait Gallery in London  --  an exquisite miniature on ivory , attributed to one of Holbein 's students , and done with almost the master 's genius . I had seen copies . They were all over the place , including Maidenwood . One of my crazier ancestors had claimed we were descended in a roundabout way from Lady Jocelyn . Very roundabout , considering that if she was n't a figment of someone 's imagination , she had died in 1622 without issue . " The attribution is questionable , " I said , in my nastiest pseudoscholarvoice . " But just suppose , " Alan persisted . " Suppose it did happen , in the way the lost letter described it . When King James realized she was in earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Virginia  --  so long as she never married . If the husband he chose for her was n't good enough , she could damn well live and die a virgin . Does n't that fit his peculiar personality , the blend of cruelty and sentimentthat distinguished his actions ? " This time the magic of his voice failed to entrance me . I suppose , in an odd way , I had always been jealous of the Lady . Jealous , not even of a ghost  --  the ghost of a fantasy ! But the miniature was so beautiful . The raven hair , the wide blue eyes .. . " And then the massacre , " Alan went on . " One version of the story claims she was captured and carried away by the Indians ; that she fell in love with her stalwart brave and bore him children . Another version suggests that she killed herself rather than be taken alive . When the rescue expedition arrived , too late , they found the dead lying where they had fallen , decomposed and torn by wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmarked graves . But just suppose . . . suppose they thought her worthy of more respectful treat/ment . A well-made coffin , a leaden shroud  --  some method that would preserve her bones through three and a half centuries . " " Alan , " I said , half convinced , " you are just  --  just romanticizing  --  aren'tyou ? You do n't really believe  --  " " Hell , no . " He looked directly at me . His eyes were no longer dreamy ; they sparkled with devilish amusement . " But does n't it make a great publicity story ? You have n't heard the rest of it  --  the infant , born in defiance of the king 's command  --  " " You son of a gun , " I exclaimed . " Are you really going to print that yarn ? Your colleagues will crucify you . " " Oh , I 'll hedge it around with all the proper scholarly reservations . But if all else fails  --  sure , I 'll publish it . I have to do something to get funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little thing like money stop me . " " I have never heard anything so immoral , dishonest , unprincipled , shameful  --  " " I said it was just a story . " Alan grinned . " But Maydon 's Hundred is n't . It 's here , damn it , and I 'm going to find it . " " So that 's where you got to , " said Shirley , at the porch door . " Is this mess on the stove supposed to be supper ? " We ate soup for supper , because that 's all there was . I promised Shirley something exotic next day  --  crab , lobster , whatever she wanted . Martha grumbled over the meal , which I took as a compliment to my cooking . After supper we settled down to Bleak House , and for once I found Esther 's hideous optimism almost soothing . Every time I thought of Alan 's underhanded scheme for raising the money to carry out his heart 's desire , I could n't decide whether to laugh or swear . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I needed was exercise  --  a long brisk walk , attended by my faithful dog . But the darkness intimidated me , not only because there was a chance I 'd fall over something and sprain an ankle , but because the night teemed with dangers  --  ancient phantoms and crazy live people . I made sure everything was locked and bolted , and then I went to the library . It was a grisly promenade at night , with only the sallow light of a single flashlight to push the dark away . I did n't prolong my visit ,  |p100but  went straight to the shelves containing volumes on history . I had not been much interested in those books in the past , but I vaguely remembered having seen a book about Maidenwood . The shelf was shrouded in cobwebs , but the book was there ; my memory was workingadmirably now that it had been jogged so often . I took the Maidenwoodbook and a few others on Virginia history , and left the room , almost running . There were ghosts haunting Maidenwood all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angry , unhappy child that I had been . I woke next morning with a bad taste in my mind , like a mental hangover . The window was opaque with soft white mist . The air felt close and hot ; it was going to be a warm day once the fog burned off , which it inevitably would . A super day for digging in an open field full of bugs . I heard Martha 's voice raised in protest as I stumped grumpily past her door . I was not moved to stop and inquire what she was complaining about . I put the kettle on ; then a scratching at the back door reminded me of my new responsibilities . The sight of Elvis , clean and eager-eyed , and unashamedly delighted to see me , wiped away some of my evil humor . I was beginning to understand why people own dogs . It 's nice to have someone adore you uncritically , even if your position as a source of food is a large part of that adoration . He did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to come in . My mind was so muzzy I had to concentrate before I figured out the solution : close the kitchen door . Elvis had polished off his breakfast by the time the kettle boiled . He settled down at my feet while I drank my coffee , his tail making a soft rhythmic sound . I knew why I was in a bad mood , and it was not lack of sleep , though I had sat up late reading . It was the content of what I had read that bugged me . The little book about Maidenwood , written at the turn of the century by one of my dippier distant relatives , was an uncritical hodgepodge of fact and fancy , legend and history , served up with a generous dollop of self-esteem . Anything that augmented the pride and glory of the Carrs was fact , to him . Not only did he believe in the Lady , he referred to her as " my ancestress . " The other books reduced Lady Jocelyn to her proper position  --  " a pretty legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a more solid foundation . There had been such a settlement , the authorities agreed on that . They did not agree on its location . Nobody had ever mounted an expedition to look for the remains of Maydon 's Hundred , and for very good reasons . The biggestreason was lack of money . Archaeology is an expensive activity , and there were dozens of other sites that attracted greater interest . The author of the book on Maidenwood , who ( erroneously ) fancied himself a scholar , had done some casual digging . He was convinced that the lost Hundred had been located at Maidenwood , and he offered , as proof , a rusty piece of metal he claimed was part of a suit of armor dating to the reign of James the First . There was a photograph of this artifact in the book ; it looked like a fragment of a fender from a Model-T . I could see why it had not impressed the historians . Some of them agreed that Maidenwood was one possible site , but only one of several , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I had hoped to discover that Alan was as far off-base with regard to Maydon 's Hundred as he was about the Lady  --  for I still was not convinced he had wholly abandoned his " pretty legend . " No such luck . The kitchen door opened . " How come you closed  --  " Shirley began . " Oh , I see . Now , Elvis , do n't do that  --  you get me distracted ... Julie , there 's a woman at the front door and she  --  " The woman was n't at the front door , she was at the kitchen door , right behind Shirley . Elvis , who had greeted Shirley with lickings and waggings , began to growl . I caught his collar in time to keep him from launching himself at the newcomer . " Who  --  " I began . " Restrain your dog , please , " the woman said in clipped tones . " If he attacks I shall be forced to take legal action . My card . " Keeping a safe distance from the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fall on the floor . With some effort I got my wits together  --  Elvis out , Shirley back to Martha , a cup of coffee in her deserving hand , the kitchen door closed . Then I turned my attention to the intruder , who had stood her ground , immovable as a granite statue . She looked like someone 's secretary , stocky and shrewd-eyed , wearing a gray pinstripe suit and sensible shoes . Horn-rimmed glasses dominated her face ; her features were otherwise unremarkable except for those knowing eyes . She had retrieved her card . When she thrust it at me a second time , I took it . " Pauline A. Hornbeak , P.A. , B.A. , M.B.A ... " I looked up . " PA. ? "  | " Psychic archaeologist . " " Oh , damn , " I exclaimed . Pauline A. Hornbeak raised her eyebrows . " I beg your pardon ? " " You should . What 's the idea of barging into a private home without an invitation  --  and at this ungodly hour ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauline , soundingas insincere as a politician explaining what he was doing with that fan dancer . " I have written Senator Matthew Ellis without having received the courtesy of a reply . My letters to Professor Alan Petranek have also gone unanswered . Their unaccountable rudeness left me with no alternative but to come to you . " My adrenaline had begun to flow , tardily but strongly . I shouted at her . " No alternative ? You had the obvious , reasonable alternative of staying away . What the hell is the matter with you people ? " From outside the door Elvis let out a sharp , agitated bark , and I moderated my voice . " I ca n't believe you , lady . Go away before I call a cop . " Pauline gave me a pitying smile . " Your lack of courtesy does not touch me , Miss Newcomb . I am in tune with my Masters . I am insulatedby a blanket of karmic invulnerability . Are you going to ask me to sit down ? " " No . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not indulge in stimulants , they are rank poison to the system and cloud the psychic senses . But as a symbol of good feeling  --  " " I am not going to offer you a cup of coffee . A cup of rank poison , if I had it . . . See here , Miss  --  Mrs.  --  " " Call me Pauline . " " Thank you , no. , , I straightened the card , which I had squashed between my clenched fingers . " The Research Center for Psychic Archaeology . I read one of your letters . " " Then you understand my purpose in coming . Let me explain further . I know where  --  " " If you run , you can probably get into your car before the dog catches up with you . He 's a little lame . " I had to lead her to the door and shove her into her car . She kept talking every step of the way . Only the advent of Elvis , limping but full of zeal , prevented her from continuing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep him from chasing the car down the driveway , and from barking . Either he was sensitive to atmospherep103or he had been trained not to bark unnecessarily . He certainly paid no attention to most of my other orders . I went back in the house . Shirley was waiting at the top of the stairs . " Miz Martha  --  " she began . " Right . I 'm coming . " Shirley always left the lying to me . I told Martha the visitor was a Jehovah 's Witness , hoping that group was as prevalent and as pushy here as it was in my neighborhood . Apparently it was , for Martha did n't question my story . It was an inauspicious beginning to a day that held little promise of anything better . I asked Shirley 's indulgence while I made a quick trip to the grocery store . When Mrs. Danner arrived , I dashed downstairs to threaten her with a painful death if she laid a hand on the pots and pans . I had changed to jeans and a long-sleeved shirt ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I went out the back door and saw Elvis sprawled lazily in the shade , I had a strong inclinationto join him . He was bored , though . When I started along the path to the pasture , he went with me . We found Alan folding his tents . A few patches of raw earth were the only remnants of his unsuccessful excavations , and he was loading his card table into the van . " Where are you off to today ? " he inquired . " Whither thou goest , " I replied . He gave me a dirty look . " Come and meet the others . " There were only four of them  --  a skeleton staff , to use a not-toonicepun . The hulking young man was a football player  --  third-string tackle , he proudly informed me . His name was Willkie . He would have told me more , but Alan whisked me away and introduced me to the girls . They really were girls , not more than eighteen , and obviously infected with the same virus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same age . One was blond and one was brunet ; both looked at him with wet-lipped adoration and at me with identical expressions of hostility . The fourth member of the team was Alan 's protege , a graduate archaeology student from the University of Virginia . He was even bigger than Willkie  --  very handsome , very black , very muscular . He could have been a football player , but , as he informed me , he had never really enjoyed being mauled by other big muscular males . He was obviously intelligent as well as handsome . Alan treated him withp104a courtesy he did not accord the others ; he ordered them around like galley slaves , but he occasionally said " please " and " thanks " to Jono . Alan left Jono to supervise the packing up , and offered me a seat in his Jeep . We went bouncing off across the pasture toward a belt of trees on a ridge to the northwest . I expected Alan would stop when we got to the trees ; instead he drove over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence and headed straight for a pine tree two feet in diameter . He did n't hit it , or the tree behind it , but he did n't miss either by much . After I had opened my eyes I saw that a rough trail had been hacked through the woods . It ended in a clearing  --  not a natural glade , but a man-made opening . The uprooted trees and brush had been pushed to one side , where they stood like a wall . " You had a bulldozer in here , " I said , as Alan stopped the Jeep next to the brush pile . " Did Matt give you permission ? " " I did n't ask him . Watch out , that 's poison ivy . " It was , and there were equally unpleasant plants among the debristhat loomed at my shoulder . Instead of getting out , Alan rummagedunder the seat , emerging with a paper bag , from which he took a sandwich and a bottle of beer . " Want some ? " " No , thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration he applied to his work . After a while I said , " Are n't bulldozers frowned on in your profession ? " " I 'm not crazy about using them myself . In this case I had no choice . " " I assume you had a reason for picking this particular spot ? It does n't look promising to me . " " That 's because you do n't know anything about it , " Alan said . " This is probably where your great-great-uncle Albert found the piece of armor . You do remember my talking to you about Albert ? " I did n't tell him my memory was as leaky as a sieve . There was some excuse for its inadequacy in this case , since at the time he had lectured me about his pet theories I had been intent on the cadences of his voice and the way his lips shaped the words , instead of paying attention to what he was saying . I saw no reason to go into this , in view of the fact that I was freshly informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ? " I asked suspiciously . Alan crumpled the bag and tossed it and the bottle into the backp105of the Jeep . " Not in your library , my dear . I was never admitted to that holy of holies , if you recall . " " I thought we agreed not to call up the past . " " We did . Sorry . Your ancestor presented copies of that inane book to every library in the state . I do n't suppose he actually sold more than ten . They were received with proper gratitude and promptly filed away in the farthest possible storeroom . A few are still in existence , forgotten but not beyond reach . " " And this is where he found the  --  whatever it was ? " " I ca n't be certain . He was no surveyor , and his measurements are vague in the extreme . The pasture was one possible site . I started there , partly because it was more accessible , and partly because many of the early settlements were close to the river . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so susceptible to the malarial mosquitoesthat wiped out so many of the settlers at Jamestown . This was an open field ninety years ago . If you look at the vegetation you can see it has grown up in the last half century . " The fallen trees looked older than that to me , but what did I know ? Before I could comment Alan said , " Here they come , " and got out of the Jeep . In spite of my grounding in archaeological technique I still harboreda few fantasies  --  plunging my spade into the earth and turning up a golden necklace glittering with gems , or a chest of pieces of eight . Nobody plunged a spade or anything else into the earth that afternoon . The entire time was spent in what Alan called plotting the site . I would have called it plain ordinary manual labor . The bulldozer had left the ground littered with broken branches and twigs , tangled vines and roots . So our first job was to finish clearing the ground . We used rakes  --  plain ordinary garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed a clod of dirt . He had already surveyed the site . He and Jono brooded over the papers for a while , muttering about things like base lines and datum points , and then we all got to help lay out the grid . The area was divided into equal squares approximately eight feet on a side , and stakes were driven into the corners at the intersections of the grid squares and the balks . I asked what a balk was , and everybody looked at me with varyingdegrees of contempt and pity . Everybody except Willkie  --  he did n't know what a balk was either , and I suspected he did n't care . ( It isp106an earth partition left between squares , so the digger does n't have to walk on the area he has dug . By keeping the edge of the balk perfectly straight , he can also check the stratification and chart the precise depth of any objects that are found . ) I was prepared to pound in a stake or two , but that was n't good enough . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their precise elevations could be scratched into the concrete before it hardened . It struck me as an awfully complicated procedure , in view of the minuscule staff and the limited time at Alan 's disposal , but I did n't want to ask any more idiotic questions . Everyone was visibly wilted by the end of the day , and I was relieved to throw down my tools and announce my imminent departure . Willkie and the girls looked as if they would have been glad to join me . Alan looked up from some abtruse calculations he was scribbling on a yellow pad . " Are you leaving already ? " he demanded . " It 's after five . I have to get supper . Are you going to drive me to the house ? " " I ca n't quit yet . " Glowering , I started toward the track by which we had come . Jono intercepted me . " My scooter is over there . Want a ride ? It 's the long way around , but easier than walking . " I accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " Clout or blackmail ? " Jono grinned . " I work nights . Short-order chef . It drives Alan up the wall to have me leave at five , but he ca n't afford to pay me and I ca n't afford not to work , so he has to put up with it . " " You work all night and dig all day ? " " So I 'm crazy . It 's an occupational hazard for archaeologists . " " Is Alan that hard up ? I thought the University funded operations like this . " " Some . Not this one . It 's strictly a one-man show . " The scooter was leaning up against a tree . I got on . " That 's why he 's so uptight , " I said thoughtfully . " So meticulous about the pro-cedure . " " You got it . If he can find something  --  anything  --  that is incontrovertiblyearly seventeenth century , he can apply for funding to several places and stand a good chance of getting it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be tempted to salt the site . "  |p107Jono  had mounted . Foot poised over the pedal , he glanced at me . " He would n't do that ! " " Just kidding . " " Oh . Right . " I wrapped my arms around his narrow waist and we were off . As we bounded over ruts and boulders I shook with silent laughter , imagining what Martha would say if she could see me . Mrs. Danner had left when I got back . There was a note on the table , a short list of cleaning items she needed . The writing was nothing like the penmanship of the crank letter ; though just as laborious , it was stiff and spiky rather than rounded . After I had dinner started , I went to the library to return the books I had taken . I put them back and looked to see if I could find anything fit to read . The place had lost its terror for me now ; it was just a dusty , abandoned room . When I examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered something else I had forgotten . It was almost the only happy memory connected with those years  --  the summer I had discovered poetry . Martha had censored the poetry section too , but she could n't find much to complain of in Keats and Tennyson . ( I did n't find out about Lord Byron until later ; he led , you know , a most dissolute life . ) And there was one book Martha had overlooked . Squeezed in behind The Collected English Poets , leather-bound and giltedged , was a slim volume of verse by Edna St. Vincent Millay . After Milton and the rest , her poems hit me like a fresh wind blowing off the sea . The book was still there . I picked it up and blew the dust off the spine . Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike ; Eat I must , and sleep I will ,  --  and would that night were here ! But ah !  --  to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike ! Would that it were day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read the lines , but I felt my eyes filling . It is so awful to be almost thirteen years old . All those burgeoning hormones and romantic dreams , all those pimples and long , bony legs ... There wasp108no acceptable vent for such emotions , certainly not for me , with Marthahovering over me like a Puritan witch-hunter searching for sin . What was that boy 's name ? Ragged and sunburned , the child of one of the nearby farmers . He liked me too . He brought me daffodils from his mother 's garden , and dusty field flowers that withered in a day . When Martha found out , she hit the ceiling . There had been nothing but innocence in those shy encounters until she started calling me names , calling me .. . I groped toward the nearest chair and sat down , my head on my knees , until the spots stopped dancing in the air . When I left the room , I took Edna St. Vincent with me.  |p109As  THE DAYS PASSED , THE NEAT EXCAVATED SQUARES IN THE CLEARINGsank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Coca-Cola bottle , circa 1956 ( Willkie collected bottles ; he became inarticulate with pleasure when Alan grimly presented him with this specimen ) . A rusted sickle blade , circa nobody knew when . A few scraps of coarse white pottery , Sears Roebuck circa 1946 . Alan 's face got longer and longer . The only one unaffected by the general atmosphere of gloom and despair was Willkie . His oars were n't always in the water , but I found his good cheer very soothing . Even the " girls " got gloomier as Alan 's temper wound tighter and tighter . The temperature rose anothercouple of degrees every day . I got into the habit of accepting a ride home from ' one every afternoon . He understood why he could n't drop me at the house ; once , when he had a few minutes to spare we sat on the crumbled gateposts and had a cigarette and talked . I likedp110him , even if he did view Alan as a cross between Heinrich Schliemann and Saint Peter . I kept trying to reach Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me where he was . She admitted he telephoned twice a day to get his messages ; yes , she had told him I wanted to speak to him . Of course , if it was an emergency .. . " His grandmother is n't dying , if that 's what you mean , " I said crudely . " Where the devil is he  --  making a deal with organized crime ? " Shocked noises came from the other end of the line . The woman had no sense of humor . ( Or maybe she was shocked because the accusation was true . ) In fact , I figured Matt was probably taking a few days off with a girlfriend . It was not until Thursday that he condescended to get in touch with me . After I had explained what I wanted , he let out a loud , exasperated sigh . " Is that all ! You said it was important . I thought Martha was worse . " " You did not . You thought I was going to quit and leave you stranded . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey  --  " " We have to talk , Matt . " " Sure , honey . " " And do n't call me honey . These fifteen-minute visits of yours are a pain in the butt . I need at least two hours to tell you what is bugging me . " " Okay . When ? " His capitulation left me speechless . I had been braced for an argument . Finally I said , " I want to get this other business settled first . Have you any objection to my telling the sheriff he can go ahead with the burial ? " " I guess not . Though I do n't see why he has to foist this onto us . " " Because we 're the lords of the manor , " I said . " The Big Cheeses . A little moldy , and full of holes , but still the best they 've got . Hell 's bells , Matt , I 'd give grave space to a dog ! It 's only a hole in the ground ; what 's the problem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " You 're right , Julie . I 'll call Jarboe right now and tell him to make the arrangements . Call you back . " He did call back , an hour later . " I 'll take you to dinner Fridayp111evening , " he announced . " Seven o'clock . I 'll be spending the night . Shall I bring my own sheets ? " He sounded pleased with himself . I assured him that sleeping accommodations were available , and waited for the next announcement . " The services are set for eleven Saturday morning , " he said . " I have to leave immediately afterward , since I have a political dinner in Richmond . Can you  --  " " Services ? " I bleated . " What services ? I assumed they would just dig a grave and  --  " " If we 're going to do this , we 're going to do it right , " Matt interrupted . " Now do n't you worry about a thing . I have it all ar-ranged . " He rang off before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , but decided there was no need ; I had a premonition of what Matt intended , and since there was no way of stopping him , there was no sense in worrying about it . I 'm not sure why I decided to take Elvis with me to the dig that day . Mrs. Pauline Hornbeak , P.A. , et cetera , would undoubtedly have claimed I had received a message from the Infinite Whatever . The message came , I think , from my nasty suspicious subconscious , which found something a trifle peculiar in Mrs. Danner 's behavior . The first thing I noticed was that she was carrying a purse  --  a " pockabook " as she called it . I had never seen her carry one ; not surprising , since she did n't use cosmetics , or smoke , and it was a good bet that Joe Danner did n't trust her with cash or credit cards . She handled this one as if it contained the family savings ; when I picked it up to move it out of my way she bleated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that she made a timid attempt to ingratiateherself with Elvis . She had never paid the least attention to him before ; he had learned to tolerate her but he showed her none of the affection he showered on me and Shirley . Now , when she stooped to give him a gingerly pat on the head , he did n't respond at all , not with a growl nor with a wag . I ca n't honestly say I was suspicious , though , not even when she offered to feed him before she left that afternoon . I told her not to bother ; but when Elvis prohosedto escort me I let him come along . Willkie was delighted to see him . Willkie was bored . Alan was n't so enthusiastic , especially after Elvis started to help dig . Elvis ended up tied to a tree , at a safe distance . He did n't seem to mind ; sometimesp112he watched what was going on , sometimes he slept , and sometimes he carried out his own excavation . He was hurt when I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jono , but he enjoyed running after us . He had fallen behind when Jono and I reached the gate in time to observe the Danners ' pickup turn onto the highway . They were going in the opposite direction , but they saw us ; Danner stared so fixedly he almost ran into a tree . I waited for Elvis to catch up and then , since he was with me , I went around to the back door . The first thing I saw was his food dish , filled to the brim with a noxious blend of dry dog food and what appeared to be Mrs. Danner 's famous stew . Fearing the worst , I left Elvis to it and dashed into the kitchen , but she had not been cooking ; my supplies were undiminished , and there was no ghastly mess on the stove . I was chopping onions and tomatoes and peppers for the western omelet I planned for supper when a series of horrible sounds from Elvis sent me flying to the door . He had eaten about half the mess in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In retrospect I ca n't believe I was so stupid . But at the time I had no grounds for doubt . Mrs. Danner 's cooking was enough to make anyone throw up . I assumed she had brought something from home in an attempt to win over the dog  --  something that had been around a little too long . I abominated her cooking , but I had no reason to question her motives . Elvis , looking as green around the gills as a brown-and-white dog can look , had gone to his water dish and was lapping furiously . Cursing Mrs. Danner , I dumped out the rest of the stew , and rinsed and refilled the bowl . Then I decided I had better do something with the remains ; I did n't want a pile of garbage right outside the porch . It would attract flies , if nothing else . Cursing Mrs. Danner some more , I looked for a shovel . There must be tools in one of the sheds . I had not explored the outbuildings . The second one I looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the contents of the first shed that puzzled me ; I kept wondering about them as I dug a shallow hole and scooped the detritus into it . The things in the first shed had not been rusty discards . Wooden packing crates were neatly lined up along one wall . The floor had been swept and the place smelled faintly of bug spray . Rolled up in a corner was a down sleeping bag.  |p113The  explanation was not long in coming . Alan had admitted he had done some test digging near the smokehouse . He had probably stored some of his supplies in the shed ; he had nerve enough to do something like that , without bothering to ask permission . I gave the incident no more thought . I had lost time , and Martha would be yelling for her supper . I went back to my innocent omelet without the slightest suspicion of what was to come . Yet deep in the distant recesses of my mind some taint of trouble ahead must have persisted . I found Martha more than usually infuriatingthat night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced , as if something amused her , and from time to time she let out a hoarse little sound that might have been a cough  --  or a chuckle . When I asked if she was catching cold , the smile turned to a glare . Lord knows there was no excuse for her to catch cold ; the weather was stifling , and I was sticky with perspiration by the time I left the room . Heat lightning flickered in the sky when I looked out the back door before locking up . If only it would rain ! Elvis looked as if the heat was getting him down too . Sprawled on his rug , he wagged his tail but did not rise to greet me . He was so limp and depressed I knelt to feel his nose . It was warm . According to the book , that did n't mean anything . My nose was warm too . His lethargic air made me a little uneasy , though . Perhaps the food had been tainted . It would seem logical to Mrs. Danner to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . His tongue rasped the skin of my hand as I examined him . He had got rid of the stuff almost immediately ; and surely , if he had been afflicted with food poisoning he 'd be worse by now .. . " Come on , old boy , " I said . " You can sleep inside tonight . I wish I could take you to my room , but the kitchen will be more comfortable than the porch , especially if we have a storm , which I hope we will . " He followed me in . I offered him a dog biscuit ; the relish with which he crunched it reassured me as to the state of his stomach . Then I said good night and closed the kitchen door . It may have been the heat that kept me awake , or it may have been my worry about Elvis . I dozed and woke and dozed again , before falling into a sticky , heavy slumber . A sound woke me . Struggling back to awareness after a nightmareof Elvis writhing in fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark . Then I realized I could n't have heard him , not fromp114the kitchen . The horrible vividness of the dream got me out of bed , however . I knew I would n't rest until I made certain he was all right . I had bought half a dozen flashlights and distributed them around the house . I took mine from the bedside table and went out , moving quietly to avoid waking Martha or Shirley . We left a light burning in the hall , near her door ; I did n't need the flashlight . I had almost reached the head of the stairs before I heard something . Not the same sound that had wakened me , but softer and less distinct ; not a distant crash or thud , that might have had any number of innocent explanations  --  but nearer at hand and familiar , and all the more frightening because I knew exactly what it was : the creak of the sagging boards of the floor in the downstairs hall . Someone was there . Old houses moan and mumble in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a sound . I had heard it too often to be mistaken  --  whenever my feet crossed that spot . I wanted to believe it was a paw , and not a human foot , on that creaking board , that Elvis had escaped from the kitchen and come in search of me . I wanted to believe it , but I could n't . There was no way Elvis could push the door open . I had tested it to make sure . Another , softer crack as the unseen foot shifted position . It was n't courage that forced me to fumble for the switch of the flashlight , it was fear  --  fear of the dark and of the unknown . Surely no visible horror could be as bad as the monsters created by my own imagination . The light caught him and froze him like a germ on a slide . Joe Danner , in his faded dungarees and work shirt , a long glittering knife in his hand . I DO N'T KNOW WHY I DID N'T DROP DEAD ON THE SPOT . I SUPPOSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a factor too . I do rememberthinking , My God , you 're so brave ! when I heard a voice that did n't even sound like mine say sharply , " What are you doing there ? " His face turned livid . The knife fell from his hand . " Who is it ? " he gasped . " Oh , Lord  --  who is it ? "  | " Julie . " I started down the stairs , keeping the light in his eyes . The nightmare had faded . Instead of the maniacal handyman from that horror movie , it was just disgusting old Joe Danner , caught in the act , and more afraid of me than I was of him . At least I hoped he was . At any rate , it was too late to retreat , and on the assumption that a good offense is the best defense , I continued in the same aggressive voice , " Stay right where you are , do n't move . How did you get in the house and what do you want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He backed slowly away as I descended , as if I were the homicidal maniac . That was reassuring , as was the fact that he had not tried to retrieve his weapon . However , I stopped a safe distance from him . " All right , Mr. Danner , what 's your excuse ? " He was not a quick thinker . He licked his lips and looked away . " I  --  uh  --  I came in the front door . I got a key . We 's always had a key . In case somethin ' happened to Miz Martha . " " Nothing has happened to her . What were you after ? You were going to steal something . " " No , ma'am . " The firm denial sounded sincere . But I had a feeling Joe Danner 's definition of theft might not be the same as mine . He went on , " I was  --  uh  --  I seen somebody prowling around the house . I thought he come in . " Though I had tried to keep my voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened upstairs and Shirley called out . " Julie ? Is that you ? Miz Martha heard voices  --  " " It 's all right , " I called back . " At least I think so . . . . Now see what you 've done , Mr. Danner . You scared the liver and lights out of an old woman who is in poor health  --  " " No , ma'am ! " Disconcertingly , the mention of Martha put him more at ease . " You ask her . She 'll tell you it 's all right for me to be here . Keeping watch over Miz Martha , that 's my job . " " I will ask her . Stay where you are . " Martha was sitting upright in bed . She started yammering at me . I cut her short . " It 's Joe Danner . He says he 's here with your knowledgeand permission , but I do n't believe him . I 'm calling the sheriff . " " No ! " The word came clear and strong . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning was clear . " You told him it was all right ? " I demanded . " You knew he had a key ? " Martha nodded.  |p116I  reached for her wrist . She flung my hand away . The only word I caught in the next tirade was " faithful . " " You might have told me , " I said angrily . " I 'm supposed to be responsible for you . " Martha 's wide-open eye shone with unholy amusement . " Now you know , " she mumbled . " Go to bed . Sleepy . " And with that , the old witch closed her eyes and lay back . I left her to Shirley  --  I was afraid if I stayed any longer I 'd throttle her . Danner was waiting for me , his expression little short of insolent . " You want I should look around the house ? " he asked . " No . What I want is your key . " I held out my hand . " But Miz Martha  --  " " Give it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took it , knowing my gesture was no more than a meaningless assertion of authority . If the Danners had one key , they might have a dozen . But it reinforced the lecture I delivered , in my most belligerent voice . " Do n't ever do this again , Mr. Danner . I 'm in charge here now , not Miss Martha , and if I find you inside the house , or prowling around outside without permission from me , I 'll charge you with trespass . Is that clear ? " He did n't argue , but he did n't apologize , either , and the look he gave me just before I slammed the door on him told me that I had not made a friend . Before I went back to bed I checked on Elvis . He was his old self ; I had to grab his collar to keep him from bolting out of the room to see what had happened . His look was one of reproach : If you had n't locked me in here , I 'd have warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had n't thrown up the food Mrs. Danner put out for you , you might not have been in any condition to warn me . I could n't complain to the police about Danner without Martha to back me up . But I could , and would , complain to Matt . It was a good thing he planned to stay the night on Friday . I had lots to say . I was almost asleep before I figured out something else that had been nagging at my mind  --  the weapon Danner had been holding . He had picked it up and put it in his pocket while I was upstairs talking to Martha , but I had got a good look at it before that  --  and it was n't a knife . It was a pair of scissors . What on earth was Joe Danner planning to do with a pair ofp117ordinary household scissors ? I mean , if you have a chain saw , why use scissors ? MY INDIGNATION HAD NOT LESSENED THE FOLLOWING MORNING . I HELDforth at some length on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's breakfast . Her only reaction was a resigned shrug and a comment to the effect that Miz Martha was a law unto herself . But when I told her about Elvis getting sick her expression turned to one of shock and surprise . " I been wondering ... " she began . " What ? " She did n't answer . " Do you think it could have been deliberate ? " I persisted . " I would n't want to say that . But why do n't you just run Elvis in to the vet 's and make sure he 's all right ? It 's Dr. Rubin 's day in ( ' arrsville . " Actually , I had planned to do just that . I had even scooped up a sample of the revolting meal to take with me . Elvis did n't look like a dog who required medical attention . He loved riding in the car ; it was not until we actually got into the office that he remembered what had happened to him the last time , and it took both Dr. Rubin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave him a checkup and pronounced me a qualified dog owner . The foot had healed well , and the flea population had decreased . When I told her he had thrown up his dinner she smiled . " That happens sometimes . They are n't fussy about what they eat . Dead birds or rodents  --  " " I know that , " I said indignantly . " It says so in the book . It also says in the book that if there is any question , take the dog to the vet . " " Is there any question ? " She gestured at Elvis , who was struggling to get off the table . " He 's fine . Did he eat this morning ? " " Yes . But I wondered . . . Is there any chance he could have been poisoned ? " Her smile faded . " You mean deliberately ? " " I 'm not sure . Someone gave him some scraps . They could have been contaminated ... " " There 's no way I can tell now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's out of his system . "  | " I know . That 's why I brought this . " I produced my sample . Her heavy brows lifted . " You 're taking this seriously , are n't you ? " " Yes . " " Okay . I 'll let you know when I get the results . It may take a few days . " I thanked her . She nodded brusquely , but as Elvis and I started for the door she said , " Talk to you soon , Julie , " and , for the first time since I had met her she patted me on the back . It felt like an accolade . I HAD N'T INTENDED TO TELL ALAN ABOUT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ; if I had wished to unburden myself I 'd have been disappointed , because he was in no mood to sympathize with other people 's troubles . His temper had been visibly worsening all week . Later that afternoon he finally cracked . Willkie presented his glorious leader with a new find  --  two rusty arrowheads and the jawbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to finds from that square  --  otherwise empty  --  and gravely recorded the information in his work book . Then , as we all stared in fascinated horror , he ripped half a dozen pages from the book , tore them into confetti-sized scraps , and flung them into the air . " Go home , " he said in an ominously quiet voice . " That 's it . No more . " " That 's it ? " Willkie was being paid  --  minimum wage , but he was being paid . He looked horrified . " You mean you do n't want me to come no more ? " " What are you talking about ? " Alan demanded . " Be here Monday as usual . " " Oh , right . Sure . " " Before you go , put the tarps over the squares . " " It 's not gon na rain , " Willkie said innocently . " Weather man said more of the same till  --  " Alan cleared his throat . The crew scattered , quaking . After the tarpaulins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep . I was about to follow Jono when a roar from Alan stopped me . " I want to talk to you , Julie . "  |p119I  gestured . " I was going  --  " Alan moderated his voice  --  not in deference to me , but out of respect for Jono , who was watching him interestedly . " I 'll take Julie home , Jono . You go ahead . " " Right , boss . " Jono 's expression was so preternaturally solemn I knew he was struggling to keep from smiling . I could not imagine what he thought was so funny . Alan waited till the others had left . " Are we going to walk , or what ? " I asked . He yanked open the door of the van . " Get in . " " You ca n't drive that out of here . Not unless you squash your precious excavations . There is n't room to turn . " " I said , please get in . " He backed the van out  --  all the way out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I felt the vehicle reverse in a wild swing , I opened my eyes . " I 'm sorry the site is turning out to be a bust , " I said . " That 's life . " The insane ride had rid Alan of some of his bad humor . " I 'll check my calculations over the weekend . Looks as if we are in the wrong place again . " " Looks as if , " I agreed . " Alan , do n't you have any leads except the ones you got from that crazy book of my crazy ancestor 's ? " " I wish I did . The terrain is a factor , of course ; some areas are more suitable to occupation than others . Local legends can be useful  --  even place names . That 's something I had hoped you might help me with . Any old tales of Maidenwood you never told me ? " " A couple of hundred , I should think . The one about the gal who poisoned her husband to keep him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard that one . I 'm not interested in modern scandal , but in stories you would probably dismiss as myths or fairy tales . Buried treasure , ghost stories  --  " " Ghost stories ? " I repeated incredulously . " Most of them are standard fiction , of course . But you 'd be surprisedhow long the memory of a startling or tragic event can survive , passed down from father to son . Distorted and misinterpreted in the transmission , of course , but often retaining a grain of truth among the chaff . A massacre like the one at Maydon 's would be such an event . As I think I mentioned , stories about wailing ghosts sprang up soon afterwards , and the ghost stories might survive after thep120initial cause was forgotten . A certain room or a certain spot , reputed to be haunted  --  shunned by those whose fathers had warned them about it , and who warned their children in turn . . . Names that linger on centuries afterwards , like Gallows Hill or Deadman 's Dyke or  --  What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I exclaimed . " Deadman 's Hollow . It was one of the places on Maidenwood land that was strictly off limits for me when I was young . Martha said the ground was boggy , crawling with poisonous snakes and insects .. . The boys went there sometimes , though ; they would dare one another to spend the night , especially at Halloween . A boy I  --  a boy I knew , back in sixth or seventh grade , told me about it . You do n't suppose ... " Alan shook his head , smiling . " Sorry . I 've heard that one too . I even checked the place out . Next to the new road , at the bottom of that steep curving hill ? " I nodded . " That 's where she was found . " " She ? " It took him a few seconds to figure out what I was talking about . " Oh , the skeleton . That does n't mean anything , Julie . The comedians who found it could have carried it some distance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Danner . Or were you thinking she crawled up onto the road by herself ? " His smile vanished abruptly when he saw the look on my face . " Julie ! I did n't mean  --  I 'm sorry ! It was a stupid thing to say . " I pressed my hands to my cheeks . Hands and cheeks were icy cold , as if all the blood had drained out of them . Gradually feeling and warmth returned , and I summoned a sheepish smile . " It 's all right . I do n't know what came over me . It was such a gruesome idea ... " " Gruesome , sick , black humor , " Alan agreed quickly . " And not very humorous . " I really could n't imagine what had come over me . I felt like a fool . " So , " I said , to prove that I was n't a fool , " Deadman 's Hollow is a washout . " " In every sense of the word . " Alan acknowledged the horrible pun with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be fairly modern . I have n't come across any reference to it in the older records . " " Oh . Well , I 'll give it some thought . Maybe I can come up with something . " " How about dinner tonight ? "  |p121I  was so surprised I lost my grip on the window frame and hit my head on the roof as the van bounced over a ridge . " I ca n't , " I said . " Are n't you entitled to an evening out occasionally ? You 've been on duty for almost two weeks . " Two weeks . . . The phrase triggered a flood of memory . Our " twoweekanniversary . . . " I had been so anxious to impress him with my culinary skills ; but I forgot to turn the heat down after the veal had browned , and then we got a little distracted . . . I had paid eight dollars a pound for that veal . The stench of charring meat finally tore me from his arms , screaming like a Victorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o late ... Alan had laughed so hard I thought he 'd choke  --  and insisted on eating every blackened , leathery scrap of that wretched meat . I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye . He was staring straight ahead , his profile impassive , but a muscle at the corner of his mouth twitched , as if he were remembering that arduous exercise in mastication . I almost said something  --  but I got cold feet . " I ca n't , " I repeated . " Matt is coming to take me to dinner , and there are some things I want to discuss with him . " " Oh , yeah ? Why the change in routine ? I thought Saturday was his usual day . " His cool , calm tone hit me like a slap in the face . The memories that had softened me had n't touched him at all . I hated myself for succumbing to sentimentality , and I hated him for making me succumb . " How did you find out ? " I demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You knew Matt was coming this evening and you knew why . Who told you the burial service was tomorrow morn-ing ? " " You did . " A slow satisfied smile curved the corner of his mouth . " I knew it was on the agenda , but I did n't know when . " " You really are a bastard . " " For asking you to dinner ? When are you going to overcome that stupid . . . " He stopped . Then he said quietly , " I did n't know Matt was coming out this evening . The invitation was made in good faith . It still stands . " " Thanks , but I 'd hate you to waste precious cash that could be spent digging holes . "  |p122Alan  shrugged . " Do you mind if I attend the obsequies ? " " Yes , I do mind . But short of an injunction , which I could n't get in time , and a shotgun , which I disapprove of on principle , I ca n't think of any way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gates . " See you tomorrow , then . Er  --  what time did you say ? " " I did n't say . Eleven o'clock . " As I started down the long road to the house I saw Elvis coming  --  a brown-and-white blur enclosed in a loud of dust . He always seemed to know when I was due back . I hastily sat down . Once he had knocked me off my feet with the exuberance of his greeting . Now he flung himself into my lap and we exchanged pleasantries  --  licks , hugs , compliments , excited whines . He was too big to be a lap dog , but he did n't know that . I had had a few words with Mrs. Danner about Elvis before I left the house . Quite a few words . I would have said even more if she had not taken the wind out of my sails by starting to cry . It was awful . I would n't have felt quite so bad if she had burst into loud lamentations , but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first tear oozed down along one of the deep lines in her cheek and twinkled in the sunlight that I realized what was happening . So what could I do but tell her I was sorry ? I was sorry for her . Poor woman , she was caught between a rock and a hard place , with me on one hand and her husband on the other . If there had been an attempt to poison Elvis , Joe Danner was behind it ; his wife would n't have had the gumption to take such a step on her own , nor would she dare resist his orders . All the same , I repeated my warning before I left . Shirley had promised to keep an eye on Elvis , but the most reassuring fact , to me , was that Mrs. Danner did n't have her " pock-abook . " I was in no hurry to get to the house , so I continued to sit , withElvis sprawled across my legs drooling onto my jeans . Martha 's supperwas prepared  --  tuna salad , for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder women hated cooking . Three mealsa day , year after year after deadly year . . . Chicken and beef and porkand fish , chicken and beef and pork and fish ... If Matt tried to takeme to that local hangout of his , I 'd have hysterics . I wanted tripe orbrains or sweetbread  --  anything but chicken or beef or pork or fish . I decided I would not tell Matt that Alan planned to attend thep123funeral . He 'd find out soon enough  --  and probably blame me . I condemnedboth Alan and Matt to an even hotter climate than the one that prevails in Tidewater Virginia in the summer . I had planned to dress in my best , in the hope that my gorgeousnesswould inspire Matt to take me someplace fancy for dinner . The heat defeated me . I settled for bare legs and sandals and the coolest sundress I owned . My hair got bushy and unmanageable when the humidity was high ; I yanked it back from my face and bundled it into a knot at the back of my neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , running Shirley ragged with orders . Matt 's room had to be cleaned and garnishedwith flowers . ( Little did she know I had swiped his mattress ; the one on the bed now was the musty , hard object that had been allotted to me , and I sincerely hoped he would sleep well on it . ) I had been summoned to the presence three times , to get my orders . I had also been told to come in before I left , to say good night . After I was dressed I decided I might as well get it over with , so I knocked on her door . Her movable eye surveyed me from top to bottom and stayed fixed on my bare calves . " It 's too hot to wear stockings , " I said , anticipating the criticism . " We 're not going to the Ritz-Swank-Carlton , Martha ; I 'll be lucky if I get a Big Mac and fries . " The next complaint was about my hair . She waxed so vehement on the subject that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but she obviously disapproved of the style . " It 's too late now , " I said ambiguously . Matt was on time , I 'll say that for him . I suppose punctuality is a political necessity ; he had never exhibited that trait as a child . I was ready for him . " Get me out of here , " I hissed , as he came in . Matt laughed with professional heartiness . " Can you hang on for ten more minutes ? I ought to spend a little time with Martha . " I knew it would take longer than ten minutes . Martha was lying in wait , bedecked in pink and smelling of cologne . As I had hoped she would , Shirley took advantage of Matt 's presence to slip downstairsfor her supper . I had it ready  --  tuna salad and sliced tomatoes , rolls and iced tea  | " That 's nice , Julie , " she said appreciatively . " Looks pretty , too . " " I feel guilty enough walking out on you . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey , I did it for two weeks before you came . Anyhow , I owe you an evening out . " " You look awfully tired . " " It 's the heat . Gets to you when you 're my size . " " Gets to you , period . " I sat down across the table from her and sipped my tea . " I 'd forgotten how awful summers can be down here . " " You get used to it . " " I do n't plan on getting used to it . " She smiled but said nothing , and for a while we sat in silence . She was a comfortable person to be with ; I felt my frazzled nerve endings smooth out and wondered why the hell I was letting myself get uptight about petty things . Compared to Shirley , I had little to complain about . " How is Ron ? " I asked . " He 's got a job . " Shirley beamed . " Really ? That 's great ! Why did n't you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the chicken-and-chips place on the highway . It 's only six hours a day , but it 's a help . " " What about the other kids ? " " The neighbors will keep an eye on them . Frannie is sixteen , big enough to watch the little ones . " A suggestive whine at the back door interrupted the conversation . " I 'm sorry , " I told him . " You ca n't come in . Believe me , Elvis , it is just as hot inside as it is out . " Elvis looked as if he had more to say on the subject , but the arrival of Matt prevented further discussion . Matt 's eyes widened at the sight of the furry face pressed pensively against the screen , but another aggravation was uppermost in his mind . " Let 's get out of here , Julie , " he grumbled , mopping his brow . " This house feels like an oven . " " That 's one of the subjects I wanted to discuss . " " I offered Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Try forcing one on me and you wo n't hear any objections . Shirleytoo . " " Of course she can have an air conditioner if she wants one , " Matt exclaimed . " Why did n't you say something , Shirley ? "  | " Now , Matthew , it 's been quite comfortable until the past few days . Julie 's not used to it , she feels it more . " Matt put his hands on her shoulders . " You do n't complain enough , " he said affectionately . " You know , Shirley , that all you have to do is ask . How am I supposed to know what you want if you do n't tell me ? " It seemed to me that only a minimal degree of intelligence was required to note that the temperature was sizzling ; but Shirley , like so many women , was easily seduced by a sweet smile and a pat on the shoulder . She told Matt not to worry , everything was fine . " Run along now and have a nice time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Where do you want to go for dinner ? " he asked , starting the engine and flicking on the air conditioning . " I do n't care . " The rush of cool air dispelled a great deal of the aimless animosity I had felt . In our controlled environment many of us have forgotten how excessive heat affects the emotions ; there 's a definite correlation between temperature and violent crime , and I can understand why . " I do n't suppose , " I added wistfully , " that there is such a thing as a taco or a piece of moussaka anywhere around ? I 'm so sick of chicken and hamburgers . " " Spoiled , effete city girl , " Matt said . " But you have it coming . I 'll find you a taco if we have to drive to Washington . What else do you want ? " There were so many things , I hardly knew where to begin . I started with the worry uppermost in my mind . " More help  --  or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ca n't fire her , " Matt said indignantly . " The Danners have been with the family for thirty years . " " What is this , the Old South ? I do n't care if the Danners have been around since Sherman ravaged the old plantation . She 's incompetent , and her husband is crazy . He broke into the house last night . " I expected a cry of outrage or an exclamation of disbelief  --  something . Matt did n't even look at me . " Why would he break in ? He has a key . " I was the one who emitted the cry of outrage . " Is that all you can say ? I tell you the man was wandering around the house at three AM. , and you calmly inform me he has a key . He scared the hell out of me ! "  | " I suppose it was a shock , " Matt said broad-mindedly . " I 'll have a word with him . " " I already had a word with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I 'm just a weak-minded female who gets all het-up about finding strange men in her house . " " You do n't understand the local customs  --  " " If you give me that crap about faithful family retainers I 'll scream . Danner scares me . He is n't right in the head . " " He 's perfectly harmless , Julie . Martha was n't upset about it , was she ? " " Well  --  no . But she is n't right in the head either . " Matt laughed tolerantly . " She knows and trusts Joe . He has a rather feudal attitude toward Martha  --  unusual in this day and age , I admit , but no less admirable for all that . I admit he 's a little peculiar , and he has n't fully recovered from the shock of his discovery that morning a few weeks ago . That 's probably why he was wandering around last night  --  he 's hoping to lay hands on the pranksters who played that gruesome trick on him . " The explanation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my protest . I knew there was no hope of persuading Matt to get rid of the Danners ; secretly he adored the idea of having a faithful serf to protect the manor . I gave it one more try . " At least let me fire Mrs. Danner . There has to be someone better  --  if something happened to Martha while she was on duty she 'd just stand there wringing her hands . It's 's not fair to Shirley . She has the brunt of it , even with me there . " " Shirley 's quite a gal , is n't she , " Matt said fondly . I 'm sure Matt honestly believed he was paying Shirley the highest tribute in his power . I saw through the evasion , but instead of telling him that Shirley did n't need compliments , she needed help , I heard myself ask him a question that had nagged me for some time . " How long have you known her , Matt ? " " Years  --  I hate to think how many . She helped raise me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Matt glanced at me in surprise . I said , " I do n't remember . I 've forgotten her . I have almost no memories of the years I lived at Maid-enwood . " " You remember my sins , " Matt said lightly . " I had forgotten about you shutting me in the graveyard until Ip127went there the other day . Oh , I do n't mean those four years are an absolute blank , but I should remember more than I do . " " Have you talked to anyone about it ? " " A shrink , you mean ? " " Anyone . A friend , your mother . . . Why not a shrink ? I did n't expect ignorant prejudice about psychiatry from you . " " I did n't talk to anyone because I did n't know I had a problem , " I said , my voice rising . " How often would you reminisce about the good old days when you were ten , if you were miles away from where you had lived and nothing happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's a clue for you , " Matt said dryly . " Face it , Julie . Martha is a mean old devil . She used to be a mean younger devil . She is n't the person I 'd pick to look after a child . " " You mean she beat me ? " Matt burst out laughing , and I blushed for my brief descent into melodrama . " Martha handed out a few spankings and slaps , " he said . " But she did n't have to resort to physical violence . She could cut you to pieces with a look and a few words . I do n't know much about psychiatry , but I suspect we both have reason to blot out many of our childhood memories . " WE DID N'T HAVE TO GO AS FAR AS WASHINGTON TO FIND TACOS . MATTknew a good Mexican restaurant in Petersburg . Though he advised me not to take my missing memories seriously , he told a lot of " Do you remember ? " stories that evening , without ever asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people and places he mentionedbegan to come back to me . It was a gentle , sensitive probing into the past , without pressure and without risk . We were on our way home when I told him I knew what he had been doing and thanked him for it . " You 've reassured me , Matt . I remember a lot more than I thought I did . Maybe I am playing with a full deck after all . " " You 're no crazier than any of us  --  if that 's any consolation . To tell you the truth , Julie , I enjoyed talking about it . The memories were n't all bad , were they ? It 's nice having kin who share a common heritage . The tie of the blood , and all that stuff . "  | " The old blood is running thin , Matt . There are n't many of us left . " " Only two of us , in the direct line of descent . It 's a pattern that has repeated itself for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martha and her sister before that . " " Did n't Martha 's sister have children ? " Matt chuckled . " She may have . Did n't your mother tell you about her ? She ran away from home with a totally unsuitable man , as Martha put it . That 's another pattern that seems to run in the family  --  unsuitablemarriages . Martha has n't spoken to my mother since she divorced Dad , and she has never referred to her sister . The poor woman wrote several times after she fled the nest , but Martha never answered . Finally Melissa gave up , and no one has heard from her in years . " " If Martha never talks about her , how did you learn all that ? " " From the Judge . He warned me not to mention Melissa to Mar-tha . " " You mean Martha has never forgiven her , after all those years ? We are n't a very nice family , Matt . " " We 're okay ; it 's Martha who is n't . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce . You know she married a cousin in order to keep the family name . Did you ever see a picture of our grandfather ? " " I think Mother has one somewhere . Did n't he have a mustache ? " " Not just a mustache  --  big , black , sweeping mustachios , like a pirate 's . And under them , the softest pursed lips ... The poor devil died young . Martha kept him around just long enough to breed two children off him . " Chilled by the contempt in his voice , I said , " And I thought I had a grudge against her ! What did she do to you , Matt ? " I expected him to reply with an equivocation , but the form it took surprised me . " Here lieth one who would resign Gladly his lot , to shoulder thine . Give me thy coat ; get into mine . " " Matt ! Poetry ? " " I 'm not a barbarian , Julie . But do n't tell my constituents . " " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it comes from Lincoln or the Bible . If it were known that I read lyric poems , it could lose me the election . " His voice was back to normal  --  light , amused , concealing emotion . Shirley had left the outside lights burning . When we got out of the car I lifted my face to the breeze . " It 's cooler , " I said . " Maybe we can sleep tonight after all . " " Rain by morning , " Matt said . " It is not going to rain . " " Sure it is . Look at those clouds . " As if in affirmation a red light flared in the belly of the clouds , followed by a mutter of thunder . " Heat lightning , " I said firmly . I heard the first drops patter on the roof after I had got into bed . Alan had been right  --  he was always right , even about the weather . IT WAS A LOVELY MORNING FOR A FUNERAL . FOG CLUNG TO THE TREESlike bolls of dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we walked down the path toward the cemetery I was still in a state of shock . When Matt had mentioned services I had expected some **26;13534;TOOLONG , but I had not imagined he would go this far . His suit was n't black , but the charcoal gray cast a suitably somber note . The umbrella he held over my uncovered head was black . Ahead of us , another of the same hue shielded the minister . Ahead of him , six stalwart men , recruited by the undertaker , carried the coffin  --  a pine box so ostentatiously simple it almost ranked as a valuable antique . Matt had my hand firmly imprisoned in the crook of his arm . My canvas sandals and yellow cotton dress were the only incongruous details in the decorous scene . Dire suspicions began to take shape in my mind . They were soon confirmed by a bright light that blinded me and left spots dancing in front of my eyes . Behind the spots I saw the photographer , camera at the ready . Matt stopped . " Please , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flank . Matt repeatedhis plea for privacy , but he was careful to give the second manp130a good profile . I put my tongue out and grimaced . Matt did n't notice what I was doing until the photographer started to giggle ; then he jabbed me in the ribs . " Do n't make a farce of this , Julie . " " I ca n't do any worse than you . Damn it , Matt  --  " " Not now , " the future governor muttered , sotto voce . " Let 's get on with it . " Accompanied by reporters , we wended our damp way onward . At the gate of the cemetery Matt stopped and faced the press . " Keep a straight face , or no air conditioner , " he told me , out of the corner of his mouth . Aloud , he said , " Ladies and gentlemen , I understand that this is your job and I respect the public 's right to know . But I beg you wo n't follow us into this sacred enclosure . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He closed the gates , leaving the pack outside . I noticed that the grave had been dug in a spot not far from the gates , and that the open grille did not impede the photographers . I was furious with Matt , but I knew that making a scene would only prolong the discomfort . At first I did n't see Alan , and hoped he had had the sense to stay away . Then I found him , kneeling by one of the stones near the east corner . He rose to his feet when the procession entered , but kept at a distance . He was wearing tan slacks and a white shirt instead of his working garb of jeans and blue shirt  --  respectable but not theatrical . He was not the only spectator . Also at a respectful distance from Alan , and from the grave , was Sheriff Jarboe . Catching my eye , he nodded , without smiling or speaking . I had expected he might be there ; I had not expected the Danners . They stood apart from the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danner 's head was bowed . Her husband never took his eyes off the open grave . The pallbearers went about their business , supervised by the undertaker , a plump man in black . He had full cheeks and a couple of chins , but years of looking solemn had trained his face in lines that made it look longer and thinner than it really was . The minister took his place at the head of the grave and opened the book . " I am the Resurrection and the Life ... " Traditionally the Carrs were Episcopalians , when they went to church at all . I assumed Matt had chosen an Episcopal minister for that reason ; but the formal service had its advantages , leaving the pastor no awkward problems of how to eulogize an unknown . I hopedp131she did n't mind , whoever she was . Joe Danner would have minded . He had transferred his inimical stare to the minister , and I had the distinct impression that if someone had read the wrong service over his bones , those bones would have risen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up from the book . " Would you care to say a few words ? " Though I felt sure Matt had planned that last , outrageous gesture , he seemed for once at a loss for words . I was as surprised as anyone when I heard my own voice break the stillness ; and although , like another well-known person , I can quote Scripture for my own evil purposes , the phrases I repeated did not come from the Bible . " Down down , down into the darkness of the grave Gently they go , the beautiful , the tender , the kind ; Quietly they go , the intelligent , the witty , the brave . I know . But I do not approve . And I am not resigned . " A frown furrowed the pastoral brow at this pagan sentiment , but I did n't care ; that was how I felt . And the quotation seemed to strike a responsive cord in Matt . Like an antiphony his words echoed : " The sun that warmed our stooping backs and withered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in darkness , and be buried in the rain . " " Where did you get that ? " I whispered , surprised but impressed . " Your fault . " He was as good as a ventriloquist ; his lips scarcely moved . " I had a Biblical quote ready , but you got me off the track ... " He took my arm to lead me away , but I shook off his grasp . Alan was coming toward us and I did n't want him to think I had been an active participant in the proceedings . The cameras flashed as Matt and Alan confronted one another . " I do n't recall inviting you to be present , Professor , " Matt said . " This was supposed to be a private family service  --  " " I suppose they 're all cousins , " Alan said , indicating the reporters . " I would n't have missed this for the world , Senator . Particularly the last act . " " Last act ? What  --  what  --  " Matt 's voice failed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone twice , in a day.  |p132Alan  pointed . " She 's been there behind the mausoleum the whole time . " She emerged , trying to look as if she had been planning to make her appearance at that point . She wore the same pinstriped suit , but she had tied a transparent rain bonnet over her head . Ignoring the rest of us , she minced through the rain-soaked grass till she stood by the grave . " Hail to you , sister . Hail , Lady Jocelyn ! Not to your mortal remains , which lie here , but to your immortal spirit , with which I spoke last night . Your wishes have been followed , Jocelyn ; you lie in holy ground at last . " This speech wiped the grin off Alan 's face . He started for Mrs. Hornbeak , who skipped nimbly aside without interrupting her cozy chat with the ghost of Lady Jocelyn . " Fear not , sister , I will impart to these skeptics the tidings you gave me . Rejoice in the sunshine and love of the hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but recovered herself , and I went in pursuit of Alan , who really looked as if he wanted to strangle the woman . The photographerswere having a field day . Flashes exploded like fireworks . It was Sheriff Jarboe who halted the farcical pursuit . Darting forward , he took Mrs. Hornbeak by the arm and stood between her and Alan . " Shame on the both of you , " he said sternly . " Do n't you know better than to act up at a time like this ? " " I came on an errand of love and mercy , " Mrs. Hornbeak cried . " My messages have been unanswered , my offers of help ignored  --  " " I do n't care what you came for , lady ; the fact is , you 're guilty of trespass . Want I should arrest her , Senator ? " " No , no , of course not . I 'm sure Mrs. Er-um 's motives were of the best . If she will leave quietly I 'll forget the whole thing . " " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can show you the place  --  she wants you to know , you who are her descendants . " " If you do n't shut that woman up , I will , " Alan said , trying to get at Mrs. Hornbeak . " You shut your own face , Professor , or I 'll arrest you for creating a disturbance . Everybody out of here . " The undertaker wrung his hands . " But , Sheriff  --  " " I do n't mean you , Sam . Get on with it . " Alan shrugged . Thrusting his hands into his pockets he strodep133angrily toward the gate . One of the reporters hesitated , and then took off after him . The others converged on Matt . " Please follow me to the house , " he instructed . " I 'll talk to you there . Julie ... " " Go on , " I said . " I 'll be there in a minute . " Mrs. Hornbeak was led away by Jarboe . The minister had made his escape somehow ; I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Danners had gone too . Mopping his brow , the undertaker followed the others . His assistants began to fill in the grave . I stood watching them . The mist had thickened ; drifting clouds of soft white veiled the ugly scene . The hollow thud of damp earth on the coffin was the only sound that broke the silence . I wondered if she had been laid to rest in that ugly , ill-fitting dress . I had n't thought about it before . Perhaps if I had , I would have done something , found a more becoming gown . . . Becoming to bleached bones and grinning skull ? Cheap modern polyester trimmed with machine-made lace at so much a yard ? But I might have searched the old trunks in the attic . . . Why had n't I done that ? Because  --  the answer came swift and clear  --  because I did n't want to go there . Because I was afraid to climb the narrow , dusty stairs , afraid of awakening hurting memories  --  afraid of what I might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I whispered , " I 'm sorry ... But none of this really matters , does it ? " I was beginning to sound just like Mrs. Hornbeak . I groped for a more formal epitaph , but nothing came to me . Rest in peace ? I had no reason to suppose she did not . Matt 's strange quotation came back to me . " Be buried in the rain ... " At least it was appropriate . Rain is kinder than sunlight on the bowed heads of the mourners . I WENT TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND SAT ON THE PORCH COMMUNINGwith Elvis . He had better manners and better sense than most of the people I had seen that morning . I had heard voices , even laughter , from out in front , where Matt was entertaining the press and getting his picture taken on the steps of the family mansion . He 'd make surep134the photos did n't show the broken windowpanes and overgrown boxwood . It would be so easy to despise Matt , if it were n't for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I did n't want to murder him . Eventually the tumult and the shouting died . I continued to sit on the steps . I ought to do something about lunch . This was Mrs. Danner 's day off and I owed Shirley some Martha-sitting time . I felt as shapeless and forlorn as the fog that hung over the trees . No wonder Matt had given in to the sheriff 's request . He had seen a chance to get his name in the papers ; for the ending to the bizarre story was bound to attract media attention . Alan was just as bad . He had sneered at Matt , but he had not avoided the photographers . Shirley found me still sitting , with Elvis 's head on my lap . " Here 's where you 're hiding . Miz Martha 's having a fit . She wants to know what all the racket was about . " " Tell her to ask Matt . " " He left already . " " Damn him . " I scrambled to my feet , pushing poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's left me holding the bag . What are we going to tell Martha ? " " I do n't know , " Shirley said helpfully . I went to the kitchen and started taking things out of the refrigerator . " I 'm tempted to tell Martha the whole story . All this tender concern for her sensibilities  --  she does n't have any , she 's tough as steel . " " You want to take the responsibility , you go right ahead , " Shirley said . " It 's not my place to do it . " " Nor mine , I guess . Oh hell . Go home for a few hours , why do n't you ? I 'll give Martha her lunch , such as it is , and tuck her in . I 've nothing better to do anyway . " I told Martha part of the truth  --  that the people she had heard had been reporters and photographers , interviewing Matt about something to do with his campaign . She was more restless and agitatedthan usual , and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head in vigorous refusal . " Do you want me to read ? " I asked resignedly . Another shake of the head . She wanted something from the shelves next to the fireplace . I guess I 've forgotten to mention that Martha 's bedroom was asp135crowded as a pack rat 's nest . It was spotlessly clean  --  Shirley and Mrs. Danner saw to that  --  but every drawer and shelf was crammed with odds and ends . Photograph albums , scrapbooks , boxes filled with clippings , other boxes filled with God-knows-what . Several of the scrapbooks were devoted to Matt 's career . Until she had had her first stroke , Martha had kept them up to date . She did n't want the scrapbooks . She did n't want this box or that one . I finally found the one she had in mind , an antique cookie tin , and handed it to her . Her nails scratched ineffectually at the lid . I said , " Here , let me  --  " and reached for the box . Martha 's claws closed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Read . " When I looked up from the book a little later she was asleep , hands resting protectively on the tin box . I dozed off too , lulled by the dripping rain and gloomy skies . Waking from a dream of fire  --  one of my recurrent worries in that old barn of a house  --  I realized that the siren ringing was that of the telephone . By the time I reached it , Martha was awake and cursing  --  or maybe not , her mumbles usually sounded as if she were swearing . It was Matt . " Hi , Julie . " " You son of a  --  " I began , and broke off , seeing Martha 's beady eye fixed on me . " What 's the matter ? " " What 's the . . . We were sorry not to see you before you left . You and your buddies made a lot of noise . Martha was disturbed . " " What did you tell her ? " " The truth . " A gurgling noise at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I waited a few seconds before relieving his anxiety . " I could n't tell her what it was all about . Your political machinations leave me baffled . " Oh . " He let out a sigh of relief . " I knew I could count on you , Julie . " Martha was waving her hands and mumbling . I said , " Martha wants to talk to you . " " Holy God , Julie ! " " Here . " I handed Martha the phone and settled back to enjoy the proceedings . Matt did most of the talking . I do n't know what he said  --  I'mp136sure ninety percent of it was cover-up and the rest was a lie . When I retrieved the phone , Matt 's first remark was , " I owe you one for that , Julie . " " I have n't begun to even the score , Matt . " " Why do n't you buy a couple of air conditioners tomorrow ? Tell them to send me the bill . " " Tell who ? I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me ? Now , Julie , you know  --  " " Forget it . What 's on your mind ? " " Has that woman shown up ? " " You mean Mrs.  --  " " Ssss ! " The sound blasted my ear . He went on , " You 're with Martha still , are n't you ? " " Yes . " " We do n't want her to find out about Hornbeak . " I said , " Let me call you back . Where are you ? " " You ca n't call me back . I 'm  --  er  --  at a friend 's . " " You little devil , " I said . Matt ignored the comment . " She was very persistent . If she bothersyou , call the sheriff . I would n't put it past her to break into the house  --  " " Thanks . That makes me feel great . " " She 's not dangerous , she 's just a bloody nuisance . I do n't want her bugging Martha , that 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . What do you suggestI do with her while I 'm waiting for the sheriff to arrive ? " " Damn it , Julie , if you ca n't watch what you 're saying in frontof Martha , I ca n't talk to you . Just keep your eyes open , that 's all . " He hung up before I could think of an appropriately witheringresponse . I turned to find Martha staring at me with a face like stone . She might have died between one breath and the next . Cursing my temper and my big mouth , I reached for her limp wrist . Her fingers writhed like worms , clamping over my hand . " Who ? " she mouthed . " Woman  --  who ? " The unexpected , painful strength of her grasp was another shock . I can lie with reasonable facility when I have time to concoct a story , but I 'm not good at spontaneous invention . " Uh , " I said brilliantly . " Uh  --  er  --  nobody important . She calls herself a psychic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she pushed my hand away . " Hornbeak . Institute . " " Yes , right . " I should have expected Mrs. Hornbeak would have been in touch with Martha . Maidenwood had been the object of interest to a lot of people and institutions , from land developers to treasure hunters . Martha enjoyed running them off , threatening them with lawsuits . Since she knew so much , I could n't see any harm in telling her the rest . Her reaction was typical of her . " Gun , " she said emphatically . " Shoot . " " Gun , " I repeated . " That reminds me . What became of that shotgunyou had ? " Martha 's open eye narrowed suspiciously , so that it matched the other eye . I said guilefully , " I ca n't shoot her if I do n't have a gun , can I ? " She hesitated , almost believing me . Then she muttered , " Gone . Not here . Get one . " I was half tempted to tell her about the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elvis ' presence might reassure her , or it might make her furious . She kept muttering about shooting , and guns , and buckshot . Vindictive old witch ... Did n't she realize that if I peppered a trespasserI could be sued  --  and I 'd probably lose the case ? Suddenly she said something that brought my train of thought up short , like crashing into a boulder on the track . " Bones . What did you do . . . bones ? "  |p138I  STOPPED BREATHING . MARTHA 'S FINGERS CROOKED AND TWITCHED . SHElooked as if she wanted to slap me , but lacked the strength . Her other hand fumbled at the box that now lay open on the bed beside her . It was filled with an untidy tangle of objects , mostly sewing materials  --  spools of thread , scraps of cloth . And newspaper clippings . The clipping she indicated had not been neatly cut out . It was ripped and crumpled . She must have done it herself , struggling to overcome the handicap that had paralyzed one arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Matt was so worried about your finding out ... Why did n't you say something before this ? " Martha 's lip curled . She never explained her actions or her failure to act . " Bones , " she repeated insistently . " Where ? " I did n't know what to say so I sought refuge in the truth . " We buried them in our cemetery , " I said . " Nobody knew who they were or where they came from , so ... "  |p139The  sounds coming from her parted lips froze my voice and sent chills coursing through my body . They resembled the screeching of rusty hinges , but after a while I realized she was laughing . For once I was glad to return to Bleak House . It had been , to say the least , an unnerving ten minutes . Martha had been , for her , absolutelygarrulous ; she had asked questions and even answered a few . What had happened to shake her out of her customary closemouthedhabits ? Could it have been something I said ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt , and I could n't recall having made any startling pronouncements . Something about a woman coming to the house , casuing trouble ... When Martha found out it was Hornbeak I was talking about , she had appeared relieved . Was there some other woman she feared , as she did not fear the psychic ? Then the sudden change of subject , from shotguns to skeletons , and her horrible , eerie laughter .. . I did n't ask any more questions . I was n't sure I wanted to know the answers . THAT NIGHT I DID NOT DREAM OF SKELETONS . I DREAMED I WAS SIX YEARSold and Mother had taken me to a revival of Snow White . When the Wicked Queen turned into the Wicked Witch and cackled over the poisoned apple , her laughter sounded just like Martha 's . Sunday dawned dreary and wet . Shirley eschewed her flowery hat in favor of a raincoat with a pointed hood , in which she looked like a benevolent gnome . " I hate to leave you alone all day , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure . Mrs. Danner will be here , and I have n't anything to do anyway . Run along . And , Shirley  --  " " Yes ? " " Say a prayer for me . That I wo n't lose my cool and smother my grandmother . " Under the shadow of the hood her eyes shone like sunken stars . " I will . " She must have prayed . Mrs. Danner never showed up , and by late afternoon I was sorely tempted , not to smother Martha , but top140run howling out into the fog . Only Shirley 's arrival , late in the afternoon , saved me from self-destruction . " You 're back early , " I said , restraining myself with difficulty from embracing her . " Figured I should get here before dark . It 's a miserable day  --  foggy and dark . " " I 'll start dinner . " I rose . Martha flapped her fingers . " Sherry , " she said , quite clearly . " Late . Coming soon ... " " She means the Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had forgotten . I hurried downstairs . Everything in the house was soggy with damp , except for a single box of crackers I 'd had the foresight to put in the refrigerator . I smeared cheese on a few of them and arranged them on a plate . Four o'clock struck , but there was no sign of Judge McLendon . I began to think he would n't come . The weather was miserable . The fog had thickened as the day wore on ; it pressed against the windows like white sheets hung out to dry . Even Elvis was depressed . He sat by the door moaning until I opened it , and then he slithered into the kitchen , crawled under the table , and lay down , his head on his paws . I did n't blame him for wanting company . I had almost given the lawyer up when I heard the sound of a car , and I went quickly to the door . The fog came in with him like a cloud of ectoplasm ; the pallor of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . I took his hand , not so much as a gesture of courtesy as to reassure myself that he was actually there , in the flesh . His hand was as cold and damp as that of the specter he resembled . " You should n't have come , " I said . " Come now . " He smiled . " Surely I do n't look that bad . " " Oh no . I meant  --  the fog is so thick  --  driving must be hazardous . " My eyes are as good as ever , " he said firmly . A sudden fit of coughing spoiled the picture of good health ; his shoulders shook , and he reached for a handkerchief . " I beg your pardon , Julie . A touch of bronchitis . Damp weather always brings it on , but it 's nothing to worry about . " " I 'll get the sherry . " " Thank you , my dear . Just what I need to clear my chest . " When I returned from the kitchen with the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the balustrade and pullingp141himself from step to step . I backed up and stayed out of sight until he had reached the landing , knowing he would be humiliated if I followed his difficult progress and bitterly offended if I offered an arm . After I had arranged the wine and crackers on a table , Shirley accompanied me back downstairs . " He looks terrible , " I said . " Well , he 's not a young man , " Shirley said reasonably . She glanced at the shrouded window and shivered . " It sure is n't a fit night for man nor beast . Fit for . . . for other things ... " " For God 's sake , Shirley , give me a break ! I 'm ready to howl like a banshee already . " Shirley smiled faintly , but did not reply . After a moment I said , " Do you believe in . . . other things , Shirley ? " " I do n't believe in them , " Shirley said . " I do n't not believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Let 's have a drink . " " You go ahead . Coffee 's what I need ; I 'm so sleepy with this weather , I ca n't hardly keep my eyes open . " I put together a rather slap-dash meal while she sat yawning over her coffee . Neither of us spoke ; I could n't think of a cheerful topic of conversation , and I certainly did n't want to discuss " other things " or the Judge 's fragility . I had forgotten about Elvis , who was keeping very quiet under the table . Like all canny canines , he knew he could stay where he was , in the nice lighted , friendly kitchen , if he did n't remind anyone of his presence . Shirley had not seen him . When he rose to his feet , growling softly , she let out a shriek and I dropped the plate I was about to give her . The hamburger slid off onto the table and a shower of French fries flew into the air . Close upon the dog 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the kitchen door , which neither of us had remembered to close . A series of muffled thuds , followed by a final , louder thud ... Shirley struggled to get out of her chair and I bolted for the door . I knew what had happened before I reached the scene  --  that slow , painful ascent of the stairs should have warned me . I fully expected to see the old man sprawled lifeless on the floor , but when I got to him he was struggling to sit up . " Lie still , " I begged . " Do n't move , let me  --  " " I assure you  --  no damage done ... " His smile was like the bared teeth of a death 's head . " Clumsy of me . Lost my footing ... " Shirley knelt beside him . Her firm brown hands moved capablyp142up his legs and over his chest . " Do n't seem like anything 's broken ... " " No , no . Just bruised . " In a sudden , frightening burst of strength he escaped our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fully recovered . So sorry to have worried you . " His color was so ghastly I would not have been surprised to see him drop at my feet . " You ca n't drive home after a shock like that , " I exclaimed . " I had intended to ask you to stay anyway . Matt 's bed is all made up  --  " " No . No , thank you , child  --  I must go . I ca n't stay . I must .. . There are matters I must attend to tonight  --  at once . " Short of physically restraining him there was nothing I could do except continue to plead , which I did as I followed him to the door . He walked steadily , but I had a feeling  --  professional instinct or feminineintuition  --  that he was making an enormous effort to keep from collapsing . When he reached the door he turned and put his hand on my shoulder . " You 're a good girl , Julie , " he said gently . " I hope  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go upstairs now . Reassure Martha . Tell her . . . Tell her not to worry . " The door closed right in my face . By the time I opened it the car was already in motion . I turned to Shirley . " I 'm tempted to call the sheriff . " " He 's driving all right . " The taillights were red blurs in the fog , but they held a steady course . They flared brighter as the car reached the road , and then disappeared . " We should n't have let him go . " " Child , there was n't nothing you could do to stop him . Now stop fretting . You 're in a state of nerves tonight , and no wonder . I 'd better get up to Miz Martha . She 'll be thinking he broke his neck or something . You get on out to the kitchen and eat that hamburger  --  unless Elvis already ate it . " Elvis was under the table , looking angelically innocent . The hamburgerwas gone . I preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ... other things . Come to think of it , his performance had been a bit on the uncannyside . He had moved and growled a moment before the judge fell . I told myself not to be absurd . The dog 's keener ears had caughtp143a sound mine had missed , a scuffle or a stifled cry of alarm . I did n't feel like eating . I put another hamburger on to broil for Shirley and sat down at the table to finish my wine . Elvis put his head on my feet . The warm prickly weight felt good . I wished I could take him to my room . If I were awakened during the night , to hear howling in the woods and see fog shifting at the window like holloweyed , white faces looking in , it would be comforting to know he was there . Out of the question , of course . But it gave me an idea . I got up and went into the hallway . I had never had reason to investigate any of the closed rooms along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pantry , the shelves empty of everything except spiders . The second and third were low-ceilinged and small ; rain had beat through the broken windowpanesand rotted the floor boards . I worked my way along the opposite side of the hall , back toward the kitchen . Another miserable little cubby hole  --  a servant 's room , perhaps . The last room on that side was a small bathroom , antiquated but functional . There was only one other door I had not opened , and for a while I thought I was n't going to be able to open it . The door was not locked , though ; it was only stuck . When I threw my weight against it , it suddenly gave way and I staggered a few steps forward before I could get my balance . At first glance it was no different from the other rooms except that it was a little larger . In the foggy twilight , I could make out few details ; there seemed to be something obscuring the window , like shutters or draperies , that cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen and got a flashlight . With its assistance I found the light switch . When I pressed it , nothing happened . I hoped the only problem was a dead or missing bulb , for if the wiring was faulty I would n't be able to use the room . I do n't know why I wanted to use it . If someone had asked me , I could have produced glib , rational reasons . I could keep Elvis with me at night . This room adjoined the bathroom . It was in no worse shape than the others ... Perhaps this reasoning influenced my decision , but I do n't think so . I simply knew , without hesitation or reservation , that this was where I had to be . I 'd have moved in that very night if the room had been habitable ,  |p144but  it really was n't , not even by my relaxed standards of housekeeping . I decided I 'd favor Mrs. Danner with the job of cleaning it . If I could n't get rid of her , she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray upstairs and sent Shirley down to have her supper . I was definitely out of sorts with Martha , and she did everything she could to push my temper to the breaking point . I had to cut her food for her , but she insisted on feeding herself , and a sloppy mess she made of it . After I had cleaned up , she ordered me to read . The tin box she had been inspecting earlier was back on the shelf . That news clipping had been taken from the local paper , the weekly that came to us in the mail . The skeleton episode had occurred after Martha 's first stroke , so someone must have brought the paper to her . It had been naive of me , and of Matt , to believe she would submit to being cosseted and coddled and kept in ignorance of what was going on in the world  --  especially in her own immediate world , where she ruled like a despot . And it was just like her to let us go on thinking we were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had howled with laughter  --  mocking my stupidity , proving that , though physically helpless , she was still in command . She had known all along . What else did she know ? Had Matt 's decision to allow excavation at Maidenwood been reported in the local paper ? I read on and on . Mr. Bucket , the great detective , drove the erring Lady Dedlock toward her doom . Esther wrung her hands and bleated platitudes . Martha drowsed and woke and drowsed again . " ' Miss Summerson , ' said Mr. Woodcourt , ' if without intruding myself on your confidence I may remain near you , pray let me do so . " ' Men did n't talk that way nowadays . And a damn good thing , too , I thought . Or was it a good thing ? A little kindness , a little courtesy ... " ' T was brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe : ... " ' Martha lay still . I finished the first couple of verses of " Jabberwocky " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoed to the bed and bent over her . Sound asleep and snoring  --  the harsh , difficult breathing of old age . Her eyes were n't quite closed . Between her folded lids shone narrow slivers of shining white eyeball . The slits were not quite symmetrical ; one was wider than the other . I thought , irrelevantly and cruelly , that she looked like a vampire  --  one of the undead , in her coffin , waiting for sunset before she rose to suck the blood of the living . She had derived pleasure from the pain of others . She wasp145still doing it . Perhaps that was why the stroke that would have killed a weaker woman had left her with strength enough to fight back . SHIRLEY WAS N'T IN HER ROOM . I WENT DOWNSTAIRS , STUMBLING WITHfatigue but too wakeful to sleep . For two cents I 'd have dragged a mattress into the kitchen and sacked out there , with Elvis 's wet muzzlein my face . I expected Shirley would be in the kitchen , and she was ; but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table from Shirley , slurping coffee like an old friend of the family , was Alan . Shirley started guiltily when she saw me . " Oh Lord , Julie , I 'm sorry . I did n't realize it was so late . " " You 're not late , I 'm early . Martha must have been tired . She conked out a few minutes ago . " " I 'll go right up . " " Take your time . She 's dead to the world . If you 'll pardon the expression . " I got a cup out of the cupboard . Shirley murmured something unintelligible and made her escape . Smart woman , Shirley . Never explain , just walk out . She must have picked that up from Martha . The kettle was still hot . I made a cup of coffee and pulled out achair . Alan did n't move . Elvis twitched and whimpered in his sleep . " Are n't you going to demand what I 'm doing here ? " Alan asked . " No . " I drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That does n't surprise me . " " It does n't ? " " You 're good at making friends with people who can be useful to you . " A gigantic yawn interrupted me before I could develop the insult . It hardly seemed worth the effort . " My so-called charm did n't win Shirley , " Alan said . " What won her heart was my offer of a commodity nobody else has bothered to provide  --  protection . I usually spend the night out there . " He waved vaguely in the direction of the great outdoors , but I knew he had a more specific location in mind . " The gardener 's shed ? "  | " Oh , you found my lair , did you ? " " Mmmm . " " Unlike some people , I take my responsibilities seriously . " " So where were you the other night when I was confronting a maniacal handyman ? " The dramatic question fell flat . Apparently Shirley had spilled the beans . " Sorry about that , " Alan said calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mmmm . " " I 'll do better from now on . " " I wondered if it was you Danner saw . Assuming he was telling the truth about following a prowler . " " It was n't me . Did you check the house to see if there were any signs of unlawful entry ? " I might have resented his hectoring tone if I had n't been so tired  --  and if I had n't been so grateful for his efforts . He must care a little , or he would n't spend his nights in that comfortless shed . . . Then , wearily , I told myself I was jumping to conclusions . He did take his responsibilities seriously . His actions meant no more than that . " Alan , this house is such a wreck I could n't tell if someone had broken in . Actually , I had the impression Danner was lying about seeing a prowler . Another funny thing  --  he was carrying a pair of scissors . " " Nasty weapon . " " Your sense of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel like explaining that slip of the tongue ; before he could ask what I meant , I hurried on . " What would he want with scissors ? " " The logical conclusion is that he wanted to cut something . " " Oh , clever . " " Were they heavy scissors , like tin shears or metal clippers ? " " I do n't think so . Just ordinary household scissors . " " Hmph , " Alan said . " Never mind about the scissors . Danner 's so-called mind worksin ways incomprehensible to the normal world . Did you have anyluck with your research ? Any ideas as to where to excavate next ? " " A few , " Alan said coyly . " So do n't tell me . I do n't care . I think I 'll go to bed . " " Not yet . I 've had a few ideas about another subject that is of more immediate concern to you . "  |p147I  sighed ostentatiously and propped my chin on my hand . " Proceed . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture . " A lecture was just what I got . " Maydon 's Hundred was founded in 1619 , " Alan said . " And totally destroyed in 1622 . The other towns and hundreds were resettledafter the massacre . Not Maydon 's . The site was abandoned until your ancestor began the first manor house , a century later . In spite of your entertaining family legends , there was no connection between the inhabitants of Maydon 's Hundred and the first Carr  --  except for the name Maidenwood , indicating a lingering tradition . Hey  --  wake up , I 'm talking to you . " He jogged my elbow . Lulled by the familiar academic tone , I had fallen into a semidoze . " I 'm listening . " " The first manor house was destroyed in 1735 . The present house was built on or near the foundations of the first one . I 'm not much interested in either of the houses . What does concern me  --  and it should concern you and your dim-witted cousin  --  is where the originalCan burial ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date from the middle of the eighteenth century  --  contemporarywith the second manor house . There must have been an earlier graveyard with burials dating from the building of the first house . " I was wide awake now . " You think that 's where the skeletons came from ? " " The connection is unproved , but logically seductive . A lost cemeteryand bones from a lost grave . What I do n't understand is why the earlier cemetery was abandoned . " " It 's a good question . . . Oh my God ! " I started upright , kicking Elvis , who woke with a yelp . " Under the house ! It 's the only explanation , Alan ; they could n't go on using the old graveyard because they put the house  --  " Alan burst out laughing . " You 've been seeing too many honor films . Get it out of your head , Julie . There was no break in occupation between the destruction of the first house and the building of the second . The location of the cemetery would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the remains of their kin . Besides , how could the jokers who found the skeletons get to them if they were under the house ? Your grandmother is old , but she would have noticed if people were digging in the basement night after night . "  | " Oh . " Surreptitiously I wiped perspiration off my forehead . " It 's getting hot in here . " " It 's cooler , if anything . You 're the one who is uptight . Shirley is spooked tonight too . What 's the matter ? " " Nothing 's the matter . I 've had a tedious day . And there are .. . things out there . " " You 're drunk , " Alan said . " Not yet . But I 'm considering it . This weather is n't exactly soothing . Was that an owl I just heard or a vampire ? " " Owl . Good hunting weather . " " There are things out there , " I said . " Cute characters who think it 's funny to dress up dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Mrs. Hornbeak . I would n't put it past her to want to dig in the basement . " " I ran her and her crew off the property not long ago . " " You what ? " Alan grinned reluctantly . " The stupidity of the woman is only equaled by her effrontery . They drove right in along the track we 've been using . Flashlights and lanterns all over the place , pickaxes and shovels ... " " I did n't hear anything . " I leaned down and stared at Elvis , who yawned . " What were you doing while all this was going on , noble dog ? " " It happened before you adopted him , " Alan said . " Acquiring that dog is the smartest move you 've made . Why do n't you put the old lady in a nursing home and get the hell out of here ? " " You know how she is . " " Yes , I have good cause to know how she is . What I have never understood is why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , Julie , she 's eighty-five years old and she has never been quite sane . Matt has considerable influence ; why ca n't he have her declared incompetentand get her into a hospital ? " " I do n't think that 's any of your business . " " I guess not , " Alan said . " You just want her out of the way so you can have a free hand . You and your Lady Jocelyn  --  " " I do n't know why you want to drag her into this . " " Neither do I. " I put my head between my hands . Elvis , sensing my mood , began to lick my ankles . " I 'm sick and tired of virginity , " I mumbled.  |p149Alan  's smothered gasp of laughter made me realize what I had said . I felt my cheeks burn . When I looked at him he had his face under control , except for his eyes , which shone with amusement . " I did n't mean that the way it sounded , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The motif  --  the  --  the theme . Is n't that one definition of the very word ' maiden '  --  a woman who has n't lost that oh-so-precious commoditymen make such a fuss about ? " " Well , I would n't say  --  " " They used to make a fuss about it , anyway . Brand the Scarlet Woman , drive the erring daughter out into the snowstorm . . . Look at your Lady Jocelyn . One of the main fascinations of that story is the virginity angle . If she had been a widow with five children , nobodywould give a damn about her . Including Mrs. Hornbeak . " " I do n't know what you 're so excited about , " Alan said mildly . " I agree with you on every point , from the absurdity of the virginity fetish to the stupidity of Polly H. The skeletons ca n't possibly be those of Jocelyn Cartwright and her baby ; they are n't that old . They may have come from the original cemetery of Maidenwood . Though I am only peripherally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to turn my complete attention to the location of the cemetery , if only to prevent other people from looting it and possibly threatening you and Shirley . " " And Martha . " " She does n't need me , " Alan snapped . " She 's got you and Shirley ready to die in her defense . I ca n't do the job , though . Matt has thrown too many barriers in my way . " " I 'll talk to Matt . " " Good luck . I tried that . " " I said I 'd talk to him . " Far off in the dark night a faint cry rose and fell . I shivered . " Damn owls . " " That was n't an owl . " Alan got to his feet . The dog was already at the door , whining and scratching . Alan said , " Quiet , Elvis . " He took a piece of rope from his pocket and attached it to the dog 's collar . I followed the pair , man and dog , onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan 's low-voiced command to refrain from harking . The weather was clearing . Fog lay along the river meadows like a pale carpet , but in the black reaches of the sky , stars shone incan/descent . Lower down , there were other lights  --  half blurred by the mist that lingered among the trees on the ridge north of the house , fluttering like will-o ' - the- wisps  --  the dead man 's lanterns . " Son of a bitch , " Alan muttered , and trotted off , towed by Elvis . I stopped to close the porch door before I followed . I had to run like crazy to catch up with Alan , which I did at the start of the path leading to the cemetery . The lights were east of the path , between the ridge and the river . Alan did n't order me back to the house ; he only muttered , " Do n't make any more noise than you can help . " After that he ignored me , letting me climb over a rotten section of fence and snag my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The owls were hooting and the mist swirled along the ground , ' but I felt a hundred percent better than I had all day . In spite of the eerie appearance of the drifting lights , I knew they were human in origin . The only thing that puzzled me was the boldness of the invaders ; they did n't seem to be concerned about their lights being seen , and as we came closer I heard voices . Surely trespassers would n't be so open . Could it be a search party , looking for a missing child ? I should have known . Alan knew ; restraining the eager dog , he marched into the clearing where the group was assembled , and though his voice was not raised above its normal speaking level , it stopped conversation . " I warned you once , Mrs. Hornbeak . This time I 'm calling the police . " Mrs. Hornbeak had changed from her pinstripe suit into riding breeches and knee boots . She must have copied the outfit from an old lithograph showing turn-of-the-century archaeologists ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she greeted Alan , brandishinga shovel with an enthusiasm that made him retreat a few steps . " Just in time to share the great moment , " she exclaimed . " I bear no malice , Professor ; those of us on the Path are above petty revenge , and I invite you to join me  --  " " You 're trespassing , " Alan said . Mrs. Hornbeak leaned picturesquely on her spade . " You have no authority to evict me , Professor . " " She does . " Alan pushed me forward . " Ah , Miss Newcomb . " Mrs. Hornbeak nodded familiarly . " I intended to call on you in the morning . How much more fitting thatp151you should be present when we disinter the remains of your ances-tors ! " She indicated the muddy hole beside her . Two of her cohorts stood nearby ; one held a trowel , the other a shovel . A flash went off in my face as I stepped forward . I knelt by the hole . One of the cohorts obligingly turned his flashlight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin layer of dirt . Other shapes protruded , pale against the surroundingsoil . I could n't bring myself to look at Alan . " It 's a grave , all right , " I said . " Those are human ribs . " Another flash blinded me . Mrs. Hornbeak had brought several assistants to do the actual digging , but at least some of the people in the clearing were newspapermen . The fat was in the fire and sizzling merrily.  |p152MRS  . HORNBEAK WAS N'T INTIMIDATED BY ALAN OR BY ME , BUT SHE WASafraid of dogs . Alan used Elvis , who was more pleased to oblige , to run the woman and her crew off the property . The reporters were not so easy to disperse , but after a rain of " No comments " from Alan , they decided to follow the more cooperative interviewee . They did n't even get " No comment " out of me , only muffled , inarticulate grunts . I did n't dare open my mouth for fear I 'd laugh . The situation was so horribly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scientificstudy and intelligent research had come up empty , while Mrs. Hornbeak 's dippy excursions into the infinite had led her straight to the gold . Even a non-expert like me could tell that the grave she had found was old . The bones were fragile and discolored , and there was no trace of a coffin . So maybe Mrs. Hornbeak was n't that dippy after all.  |p153Alan  sent me back to the house with Elvis . He stayed , brooding over the grave like a vulture . Before I went to bed I called the number he had given me and asked for Jono . I explained what had happened ; Jono said incredulously , " You 're kidding . " " I 'm not kidding . She found something , Jono . Alan is out there now , and he wants  --  " " I 'll be there in half an hour . " I passed on the rest of Alan 's instructions . Jono could hardly wait to get off the phone and get going . The last thing I heard from him was a rapturous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan had also suggested  --  by which I mean ordered  --  that I telephonethe police . I decided that call could wait until morning . I was in no mood to explain the situation to a sleepy cop , and I doubted Mrs. Hornbeak would return that same night . She 'd be too busy talking to reporters . I should have done what Alan told me . I was awakened by Shirley shaking my shoulder . " There 's some people down there , Julie . Re-porters . " I sat upright . Sunlight blinded me . " What time is it ? " " Eight o'clock . One of ' em 's been there since six . I tried to let you sleep , but  --  " " I 'll get up . Give me a minute . " " I brought you some coffee . " I grabbed the cup . " You 're a saint , Shirley . Call the sheriff and tell him we 're under siege . I 'll go down as soon as I put on some clothes . " " Did something happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " No , nothing like that . I 'll explain later  --  just make that call , will you please ? " I scrambled into pants and shirt and sneakers , and trotted downstairs . The front door was closed . I opened it . " I just called the police , " I said . The invasion consisted of one balding middle-aged man . Apparentlythe others had given up or gone after Alan . " How did you feel  --  " he began . " Is that the only question you people can ask ? Look , there 's an old lady upstairs recuperating from a stroke . She needs peace and quiet . Why do n't you give her a break ? "  |p154The  reporter looked thoughtful . I made sure he understood the implications . " What paper did you say you were from ? I mean , I want to know whom to sue if she has another stroke . " I closed the door before he could think of a counterargument . Looking through the window , I was pleased to see him retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do about that ; the road was public property . I was dying to get out to the site and see what Mrs. Hornbeak 's discovery looked like in daylight . Maybe I had been misled by the general air of rapture ; maybe she had only uncovered the carcass of a horse or a deer . I doubted it , though . Shirley did n't respond to my suggestion that she go and see what was happening . She had no interest in archaeology . " I do n't care about bones so long as they stay where they 're supposed to be , " was her summary of the situation , and I had to admit she had a point . The law did n't appear until almost midday . I was in the kitchen making Martha a sandwich when I heard the knock at the front door . I greeted Jarboe with reproaches . " What kind of service is this ? I called almost four hours ago . " " They been bothering you ? " " Well , no , not lately . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not what I come about . " " What did you come about , then ? " " Judge McLendon . He 's dead . " " No , " I said . " He ca n't be . I saw him last night . " " Well , he is . " The sheriff scratched his head . " Can I come in the house ? " I said dazedly , " Sure . I 'm sorry . I ca n't believe it . Damn , damn , damn ! I should have made him stay here . He was n't fit to drive in the fog , after that fall  --  " " Fall ? " The sheriff followed me to the kitchen and sat down at the table . " He tumbled down the stairs in the front hall . I tried to persuade him to stay all night  --  " " That accounts for the bruises , then . Got a cup of coffee , Julie ? " " Sure . " Then I realized what he had said . " Bruises . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he got home all right . Do n't blame yourself on that account . It was a heart attack . He lives alone ; it was his first client that found him this morning , slumped over his desk . "  | " That does n't make me feel any better . " I filled two cups and joined him at the table . " Maybe this will . " Jarboe took a folded sheet of paper from his jacket pocket . " He was writing you a letter . " The handwriting was quite firm , with none of the tremulousness one associates with old age . " My dear Julie , " it began . " I must apologize for startling you as I did this evening by my clumsiness . As I assured you , there was no damage done except to my pride . Please tell Martha I will see that her wishes are carried out to the best of my ... The final " y " trailed off and ended in a ragged gouge . It was surrounded by ink spatters , like flecks of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , " the sheriff said , averting his eyes from my stricken face . " Old-fashioned habit of his . " " I see . " " His heart was bad . He knew it ; told me once the doc was after him to retire , but he wanted to die in harness , not rotting away in a nursing home . He got his wish . You could say he was lucky . " " You could say that . " I folded the letter . " I 'm sorry , Sheriff , I did n't mean to get teary , but  --  well , I liked him . He was a good man , and a kind man . I do n't know how I 'm going to break it to Martha . She 'll be devastated . " " I would n't be too sure of that . Old people are peculiar about friends dying . Oh , they 're grieved , sure , but there 's a kind of funny satisfaction too  --  like they won another round by surviving . " If that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly true of Martha . She 'd be annoyed , though . McLendon had handled all her legal affairs . " Have you notified Matt ? " I asked . " I suppose he 'll have to find another lawyer . " " Called him a couple of hours ago . He said to tell you not to worry about the business end , he 'd deal with that . He 'll call you this evening to find out how Miz Martha took the news . " I thought of several replies to this cool announcement but decided I would save them for Matt . " Is there anything I can do ? " I asked . " No , thanks . Just thought you ought to know , seeing as I was coming out this way anyhow . Do n't worry about reporters , this story will die in a day or two . It 's pretty small potatoes . " " What you 're telling me is that you ca n't spare a man to patrol the place . "  | " ' Fraid not . What I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How am I supposed to get out ? " " Oh , it 'll be something you can move  --  a sawhorse , like , with a ' No Trespassing ' sign . There 's no way you can wall this place off , Julie ; all you can do is create a moral effect . Your pal the archaeologist has things under control in his work area  --  ropes , signs , and a couple of husky kids with spades standing around looking aggressive . " I had hoped for more but I knew I was n't going to get it . He was probably right about the news being a purely overnight sensation . So I thanked him and showed him out , and then went up to tell Martha her old friend was dead . I held her hand when I told her . The pulse under my fingers did n't skip a beat or change tempo . There was a cry of surprise and distress , but it did n't come from Martha . Turning , I saw Shirley in the doorway of the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm sorry , " and it was to her I spoke . She shook her head dumbly . Tears filled her eyes . Martha twitched her hand from my grasp . " Note , " she said . " Note ? " " It was a heart attack , not suicide , " I said . " People do n't leave ... Oh . " She of all people would know of the old man 's note-writing habit . Perhaps he had told her he would write her that evening . " He was writing to me , " I said , taking the paper from my shirt pocket . " But there is a message for you . " She read it without the slightest sign of emotion . Perhaps the corner of her mouth lifted a fraction of an inch , but that was all . The sheriff was right . Under her grief was a kind of satisfaction . " Matt , " she said . " Get him here . " " He said he 'd call this evening . It 's hopeless trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ; I 've tried . " " Hmph , " said Martha , quite emphatically , and for once I agreed with her . When I went downstairs to retrieve a somewhat wilted sandwich , Mrs. Danner was there . " What happened to you yesterday ? " I demanded . " Truck broke down . " No apology , no expression of regret . I said , " If you had called , I 'd have picked you up . "  | " Weather was bad . " " Not that bad . " Mrs. Danner stared . I abandoned the inquisition , wishing I could decide whether Mrs. Danner was abysmally stupid , or smart enough to know how to defend herself against such assaults . " I 've got a job for you , " I said . " I want the room next to the kitchen cleaned . Here , I 'll show you . " The room was hardly brighter by daylight than it had been the night before . The windowpanes were opaque with dirt . Mrs. Danner stood watching as I struggled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the stick lying in the sill , and then I saw something the dirty glass had obscured . There were bars on the window  --  thickiron bars , set in a grilled frame that had been nailed or screwed onto the outside of the frame . The sight of them made me feel easier about sleeping downstairs . Nobody would get in that window , at any rate . Perhaps the other rooms on the remote ground floor corridor also had barred windows . I had n't looked . I turned to Mrs. Danner . " You had better start by sweeping the floor . I want it and the walls scrubbed  --  get off as much of the old wallpaper as you can , half of it 's hanging in strips anyway . The windowsand woodwork need washing too . " Mrs. Danner put one foot forward , and then pulled it back , as if she had stepped on something slimy . She shook her head . " What 's the matter ? " I asked impatiently . " You do n't do win-dows ? " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do windows real good . But I do n't like ... " I did n't interrupt ; her voice just trailed off into echoing silence . I was in no mood to be patient with Mrs. Danner 's vagaries . " I know it 's a filthy mess , but the longer you stand there gaping , the longer it will take to get the job done . Where 's the broom ? " I practically had to push her into the room . She kept glancing from side to side like a nervous animal who scents a hunter hidden in ambush . Once inside , she seemed to resign herself to the inevitable . She began sweeping while I carried in a ladder from the shed and replaced the light bulb in the ceiling fixture . It worked . That was a relief , though I had been prepared to make do with flashlights and electric lanterns if necessary . I left Mrs. Danner to get on with it , hoping she would n't turnp158tail the minute I walked out of the house . She was obviously not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bugging her . Nor , to be honest , did I really care . I changed into work clothes and reminded myself again to buy some boots . When I went out the back door , Elvis rose from his rug and ran to greet me . The sound of voices led Elvis and me to the site . There was no path from the direction of the house , and it took a long time for me to get through the underbrush , since I had to untangle the dog 's leash every few steps . When I emerged into the clearing I was immediately accosted by a large young man , Willkie-type , who politely but firmly asked me to go away . " It 's okay , " Jono called . " She 's one of us . Over here , Julie . " The opened grave had been refilled . Only a square of blank dirt indicated its presence . " I thought you 'd have the bones out by now , " I said . " Good Lord , no . There 's a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julie , there 's nothing for you to do unless you want to help clear the brush . Alan did n't say anything about you ... " " Where is he ? " " In Richmond , getting some more equipment and starting the paperwork . The Commonwealth has laws about disturbing human remains ; it 'll take several days to get a court order . We 've got to clear the site and survey it , lay out a grid , sink some test holes ... " " It seems to me you 're going to a lot of trouble without being certain you have something to take trouble for . Would n't it be smarter to sink your test holes first ? " Jono shook his head . His eyes were shining . " I saw it , Julie  --  last night , before we filled it in . We 've found it . It 's the right period . " " You 're sure ? " " I ca n't show it to you ; Alan took it with him . A tinned brass hook , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is it . Maydon 's Hundred . " A veil dulled Jono 's sparkling eyes as professional caution moved in to cool his excitement . " Well , we ca n't be sure , not until we find some evidence of occupation . But the grave is definitely of the right period , and he would n't have been stuck out in the woods , miles from the settlement . " " He ? " " The hook was used to hold men 's pants to their doublets. "  | " I see . Well , if manual labor is all you have to offer , I can find plenty of that elsewhere . I 'll drop in again tomorrow . " " One of us will be here all the time from now on , " Jono said . " So do n't worry about trespassers . " " What about your job ? " " I have n't quit yet . But I hope to soon . " " I see , " I repeated . Alan 's big problem , aside from Martha 's intransigence , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; without results there was no funding , without funding the chance of getting results was lessened . Alan was the world 's fastest talker , but even he could n't build a convincing case out of nothing . With a grave and a seventeenth-centurygizmo , he could probably con some foundation or university into backing the dig . Once he got the money , he could afford to pay his staff and hire others . I wished him well . If he got a big grant , I would demand wages too . So I spent the afternoon scrubbing dirt off walls and floors instead of digging it out of a grave . Prodded and assisted by me , Mrs. Danner accomplished wonders . The end result was still not very attractive . The woodwork was blistered and cracked , and the dingy old wallpaper had peeled off in long strips , except where it refused to come off at all . At least the room was habitable . I left Mrs. Danner washing the window and went upstairs to reconnoiter for a bed . When I reached the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Goodness , what have you been up to ? " she asked . " You never got that kind of dirt on you out in the woods . " I explained what I had been up to . Shirley looked dubious . " I do n't know what Miz Martha will say . " " I do n't intend to tell her . We can rig up some kind of signal system  --  a cowbell , if I ca n't find anything better  --  so you can summonme in case of an emergency . Never mind that now ; what the hell am I going to make for supper , Shirley ? I 'm completely out of ideas . " " That 's what I was going to tell you . He called a while back . Said to tell you he was coming about six , and he 'd bring some fried chicken . " " Matt ? " The suggestion did n't sound like him , so I was not surprisedwhen Shirley shook her head.  | " Alan . He 's a devil , that boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , or maybe , just told me . " Beware of archaeologists bearing gifts . But when the gift is edible and you are extremely sick of domesticity . . . " Sounds great , " I said . " I had better clean myself up . Is she all right ? " " Kind of restless . Been looking at old pictures and papers this afternoon . She keeps nagging at me to call Matthew again . Well , I tried , and left a message , and they told me the same thing . He 'll telephone tonight . " " I suppose he has a lot to do , " I admitted . " The Judge was handlingall Martha 's affairs . But I still think Matt ought to come out here . " Shirley wisely refused to comment . After I had cleaned up , I scouted the bedrooms . All I really needed was a bed and a table and chair , and maybe a lamp . I found a small table and took it down . Mrs. Danner was still washing the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scrubbing the table . The outside of the window was still dirty . There was no way of getting at it through the bars , but enough light came in to convince me that I could n't stand those scabby walls after all . There was just enough time to run to the shopping center and buy a couple of gallons of paint . Yellow , I thought . The room was dark , with only one narrow window . When I looked in my purse I found I only had about twenty dollars . I 'd have to tap Matt for more money for expenses . And had there not been some vague talk of a salary ? I added another damn to the pile I was heaping on my cousin , and informed Mrs. Danner I was going out . Elvis decided to come along . I was n't keen on leaving him with Mrs. Danner , though I believed my lecture had had the desired effect  --  and , perhaps more significantly , the " pockabook " had not reappeared . As we drove along , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I had existed so long without a dog . The man in the hardware store was willing to take my credit card , so that still left me with twenty dollars . I ducked into the grocery store . Elvis ate dog munchies and I ate cookies all the way home , crunching in chorus . My nice big cans of paint made me itch to start on the walls , but I controlled myself ; it was almost six , and I knew from past experience that painting is fun for the first hour . After that , it is n't . Anyhow , thep161best time would be in the morning , so that the paint smell would have a chance to dissipate before I went to bed . The table I had brought downstairs was standing in the middle of the kitchen , where Mrs. Danner had left it . A cheap rickety affair of painted green pine , it was still damp from her scrubbing . I carried it into my new room . The place looked even emptier with that single piece of furniture in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpaper has a bizarre , hypnotic fascination ; once you get started it 's hard to stop . Alan walked right in the back door without knocking ; only Elvis 's rapturous whines warned me of his arrival . There were two brown paper bags on the table , and Alan was taking out cartons of food . " Put this in the oven to keep warm , " he ordered . " Do n't you ever say please ? " " Please put this in the oven . " I put it in the oven . " Want a drink ? " " You talked me into it . What are you doing with that ? " The scraper was covered with flakes of white plaster and scrapsof wallpaper . I decided not to put it on the kitchen table . " Scraping wallpaper , obviously . I 'm going to move into that roomnext to the kitchen . " " Any particular reason ? " " To make it more convenient for burglars and rapists to get at me , of course . " " Mmmm , " Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What , making it easier for burglars and  --  " " Moving downstairs . You 'll hear the dog if he barks , and you 'll be closer to me if you need help . I wo n't be sleeping in the shed tonight , though . " " What are you going to do , camp by the grave ? " " Right . " " Nice cheerful place . " " It 's no worse than any other place . I did n't expect you of all people to be so spooky about a few bones . " " Me , spooky ? Listen , buster , I just finished anatomy . There isn'ta bone in the human body I do n't know by its first name . " " That 's what I meant . Where do you keep the liquor ? " " Under there . No , there . "  |p162Alan  took out my two bottles . " What , no fine vintage wines ? Never mind , they 'd be wasted on me . But you 'll have to hide the liquor if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does drink on the sly , then . I wondered . " " If you were married to Joe , you 'd drink on the sly too . I hear she used to be the toast of the town , the belle of the bars . Big , cheerful , laughing woman , with a vocabulary like a truck driver . " " I remember her . She sure has changed . " I took the glass he handed me . " She did n't change , he changed her . And himself . Finding Jesus can have a revolting effect on some people . " " That 's an awful thing to say . " " I 'm not blaming it on Jesus , " said Alan , compounding the blasphemy . " Danner scares me . He 's one of the reasons why I 've been sleeping in the shed . " " Thanks for cheering me up , Alan . " " Oh , I do n't think he 'll bother you . " I did n't care for the faintemphasis on " think " ; before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigot and a sadist , and religious mania takes peculiar forms . " " Like writing crank letters ? " " Yes , like that . After he kicked his daughter out of the house he apparently made a bonfire of everything she owned  --  which was n't much , poor kid  --  and almost set the barn on fire . He 's stupid as well as sadistic , and that combination can be dangerous . " " How do you know all this ? " " I frequent the local taverns , " Alan said with a grin . " You think women are the only ones who gossip ? To revert to the original topic  --  " " I do n't remember what it was . " " Bones , " Alan said . " Anatomy . Why did n't you tell me you had studied with Kaufman ? " " Because the subject never came up . Because it 's none of your business . And , " I said , warming to my theme , " because I might have known you 'd find out anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credentials ? " Alan ignored the question . " You 're not qualified , of course . But at the moment I ca n't afford an anthropologist . I have a job for you . " " Paid or volunteer ? " Alan blinked . " I might be able to scrape up a few bucks . " Honesty forced me to admit the truth . " Alan , if you 're talkingp163about the skeleton you found last night , you were right the first time ; I am definitely not qualified to tackle something like that . Those bones are so fragile they 'll crumble if you try to lift them . I do n't know how  --  " " Oh , I can deal with that , " Alan said confidently . " That 's a simple matter of preservation . I had something else in mind for you . " " What ? " Instead of answering he reached into one of the paper bags . He used both hands ; his long , blunt fingers and broad palms half covered the object he drew out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wild moment I thought he was holding a cauliflower . A distorted , peculiarly shaped cauliflower .. . Fortunately for me  --  not so fortunately for her  --  Shirley chose that moment to walk into the room . Her shriek drowned my gasp of surprise . Alan started . " Damn it , " he exploded , juggling the skull . Finally he got a firm grip on the thing . With a reproachful look at Shirley he said , " You should n't have startled me . It 's fragile ; would have shattered if I had dropped it . " " Do n't put it on the table , " I said squeamishly . " Why not ? It 's nice clean plaster . " He propped the skull against one of the grocery bags . It grinned whitely at Shirley , who retreated a step . " Perfect copy , " Alan said , regarding the grisly object affectionately . " I 've still got the mold , but making another one would be a devil of a job . It 's not really plaster , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care what it 's made out of , " Shirley said . " Just you take it with you when you go . I come down to get Miz Martha 's supper and see you waving that thing around ... Good thing I come , too . What 's wrong with you , child , putting that paper in the oven ? I could smell burned cardboard all the way upstairs . " She whisked the charred container out of the oven . " I had n't forgotten about it , " Alan said in injured tones . " That 's the way I always heat it . The chicken is n't burned . " " Hmph . I think I 'll take my supper with Miz Martha tonight . No , you stay sitting , Julie  --  I ' 11 just get a couple of plates and then you two can enjoy your meal . You got company already , so you do n't need mine . " " Ouch , " Alan said . " Here , Shirley , I got biscuits and cole slaw and potato salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag , butp164all he took out were a few plastic containers . She filled the plates and left . Alan pushed the container of potato salad toward me and picked up a chicken leg . " That 's the job , " he said , waving the leg at the skull . " Reconstruction . You know the technique , do n't you ? " " I watched Kaufman do it . Would you mind putting that out of sight while I eat ? " " I thought you might like to study it while you chewed . " I informed him he was mistaken . With a shrug he returned the cast to its bag . " Can you do it ? " he asked . " I 'd need the reference tables . " " I can get them for you . " " Materials  --  " " Those too . What have you got to lose , Julie ? It 's just an experiment . Good experience for you . " He knew I was tempted . Reconstruction is one of the most evocativetechniques of anthropology  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re-creation of a face from its underlying structure . Two German scholars were the first to approach the problem scientifically , back in 1898 ; their paper included a series of tables that gave the average thickness of soft tissue at various points on the human face . The results could only be approximations ; the measurementsvaried according to age and sex and a number of other factors . But some of the results had been astonishing ; in one case Kaufman had mentioned , reconstruction had enabled a murder victim to be recognized and identified . I remembered how Kaufman had gone about it . He had worked on molds too . Measuring out from the established points , setting his markers  --  he had used pencil erasers  --  then building up layers of clay , following the curves of the bones to the limits designated by his markers . He had completed the process by painting the plaster , addingfalse eyelashes and glass eyes , a wig . Building a person . I had always thought it must make you feel like Dr. Frankenstein . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan took another piece of chicken.  --  Why ?  --  " What do you mean , why ? " I touched the paper bag . " This is from the skeleton Joe Danner found , is n't it ? " " Right . "  | " You and your pathologist friend talked Jarboe into having a cast made before the bones were buried . No reason why he should n't agree to a request like that . But why reconstruction ? That 's your idea , not Jarboe 's . And do n't give me that bull about knowledge for its own sake . What you 're proposing is time-consuming and complex . Why are you so curious about what she looked like ? " For a moment Alan concentrated on his chicken . Then he said , " I do n't suppose you have seen today 's paper . " " No . We only get the local weekly . " Alan reached into one of the bags and produced another item  --  the Pikesville Bulletin , dated that morning . It took me a few minutes to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South America , and the latest presidential lies about the deficit . In a box at the bottom of the page was a smaller headline . " Grave of Virginia legend found by psychic investigator . Lady Jocelyn was real ! See page C-1 . " I turned the pages . The story was featured in the Style section , first page , and the first thing I saw was a photo of myself , glaring at the camera . My hair stood out in a frizzly bush and my eyeballs reflected the flash . The caption under the picture read , " Julia Newcomb , Lady Jocelyn 's descendant , at her ancestress 's grave . " " Oh , hell , " I said . " Read on , " Alan said . There were photographs of Alan , and of Mrs. Hornbeak , shovel in hand . Elvis was in one of them . He photographed better than any of us . Mrs. Hornbeak had had her revenge . The discovery was ( correctly , I must admit ) attributed to her . She claimed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty who fled the lust of a royal favorite to find love and freedom in the New World . " But the grave Mrs. H. had uncovered was not that of the Lady . Jocelyn 's violated sepulcher was nearby ; from it she had been wrenched by impious hands , and although she had found rest among her descendants , she wanted the world to know the truth and save her friends who rested near her from a like fate .. . The real kicker was in the final paragraph . Even Mrs. Hornbeak 's purple prose paled by comparison to the revelation contained therein . The newspaper fell from my hand . " She 's offering to finance the dig ? " I exclaimed . " You got it . " " But she  --  you  --  where does she get her money ? "  |p166Alan  wiped his greasy fingers carefully on a napkin . His neatness was an ominous sign , but he had his temper well in hand . " The organization she heads is loaded . There are a lot of rich nuts in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to accept the offer , surely . " " I 'm trying to get funding . So far this is the only offer . " " You ca n't . It would ruin you . " " Not if I found Maydon 's Hundred . " The depth of his obsession was greater than I had realized . But for once I was right and he was wrong . If he found the remains of Lost Atlantis or the Fountain of Youth , it would still be the end of his career . In the eyes of the academic world , the results would be hopelessly flawed by the nature of the expedition 's funding . " You ca n't do it , " I said . " Do you want to help me avoid it ? " " Well  --  yes . " " Then do that reconstruction for me . " I thought I understood what he had in mind . The basis of Mrs. Hornbeak 's claim was Lady Jocelyn . Anyone with an ounce of sense knew the forlorn skeleton could not be hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face on view , next to the famous miniatureof the Lady , and Mrs. Hornbeak 's error would be demonstrated by a display worth more than a thousand words . And if the reconstructionwas clever enough , it might attract the attention and the funding Alan wanted . Most people , even learned foundations , are more attracted to pretty copies than ruined originals . " You 're on , " I said . " The works  --  false eyelashes and all . " Alan nodded . He had known all along he had me hooked . " Are you going to eat any more ? " he asked , reaching for the last piece of chicken . " I have n't had any of it yet , " I said , grabbing the piece from him . My appetite and my good humor were restored . He thought he was using me , but I had a few axes to grind as well . If the reconstruction was good , it would n't do me any harm to get my name in the papers . Besides , this was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , after two weeks of bed pans and BleakHouse . And it would put Lady Jocelyn to rest forever.  |p167ALAN  INSISTED ON LEAVING THE CAST WITH ME . HE ALSO INSISTED ONknowing where I intended to keep it ; he did n't want to risk damage or loss . At first I could n't think what to do with the damned thing . The kitchen was out of the question ; Shirley had already indicated she hoped never to see the cast again , and if Mrs. Danner came upon it in the course of her quest for dirt and liquor , she 'd probably have a fit . We finally decided to stow it away in my new sleeping quarters , since that room would be my workshop . Alan pointed out that the light was poor . I pointed out that I 'd be working under artificial light in any case , and that it was up to him to supply me with proper lamps . Part of the equipment . " Equipment ? You do n't even have a decent table , " he complained , rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a bed , either , but all that will come . Let 's put it in the closet for the time being . " Mrs. Danner and I had not done much about the closet , since I did not intend to transfer my clothes from upstairs . We had swept up the fallen plaster and removed the cobwebs , but that was about all . The closet had been wallpapered  --  they had an excess of cheap labor in the old days . I had ripped off the loose , hanging strips and left it at that . " First thing you need in here is a light , " Alan said , squinting into the dark corners . " And a few shelves . You could store your materials in here . " " The first thing I need is bug spray , " I said , shying back as a big fat black Spider swung toward me , like Tarzan . " But right now I have to get up to Martha . I 'm overdue . " " Go ahead . " He whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insect life , began measuring the dimensions of the closet . " If you start hammering and banging things around  --  " " With this door and the one into the hall closed , your grandmothercould n't hear me if I set off a charge of dynamite . " I could n't argue with that , so I left him to it . The evening had never seemed so long . Now that I had something I wanted to do , I begrudged the boring hours with Martha . Shep168insisted I read , though I doubt that she paid attention . She had an enameled box on her lap , and she kept fumbling through the papers it contained . Matt finally called at a little after nine . I tried not to watch the clock , but I could n't help it . The bell roused Martha from a doze and she began grunting demands even as I lifted the phone . " She wants to talk to you , " I said , after I had exchanged greetings with Matt . " And so do I , dear favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said wearily . " Might as well get it over with . Then I 'll talk to you . " I have n't reproduced Martha 's speech patterns precisely . To do so I would have to eliminate about half the consonants . She could n't articulate clearly ; understanding her was partly a matter of knowing what the subject was , and partly watching her lips and her expression . She started by asking Matt when he was coming to see her , but this is what the sentence sounded like : " We'e " oo cuh ? " Matt figured that one out ; he was expecting some such inquiry . But as she rambled on he appeared to comprehend less and less , and every time he asked her to repeat a phrase she got madder and less intelligible . Finally she tried to throw the telephone at me  --  it fell on the bed  --  and collapsed against her pillow , glowering . " It 's me again , " I told Matt . " Thank God . How do you cope with that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Saturday , I guess . I have a lot to do . " " Saturday , " I repeated . Martha gibbered at me , her eyes bright with rage . Watching her , I said , " She wants you to come before that . " Martha nodded . " ' a-morrah , " she said . " Tomorrow , " I repeated . " I ca n't . I had a full schedule before this last disaster happened . You have no idea how much extra work the Judge 's death has caused . " " She 's quite emphatic , " I said , as Martha continued to flap her hands and lecture . " I have a few points to raise with you too . I presume a rising young politico reads the newspapers every day ? " He was quick to catch on . " Son of a bitch , " he exclaimed . " There was n't anything in the Post or the Times or . . . The Pikesville Bulletin ? " " That 's it . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think so . "  | " Oh , all right . Tell her I 'll be out tomorrow evening . Maybe we can have a quick dinner somewhere . " I relayed the message to Martha . Another half hour 's reading put her to sleep and I decided I had done my duty for the evening . Alan was gone when I got downstairs . There was a light in the closet and several shelves were in place ; it smelled of fresh lumber and bug spray . Inefficiency was not one of Alan 's failings . After Shirley had gone to roost for the night I dragged my mattressdownstairs and put it on the floor of the empty room . A few other things followed , all small and portable  --  a lamp , bedding , a chair . I would need help with the heavier things , and anyway I did n't want to crowd the room with objects that would have to be moved when I painted . I sat in the kitchen reading for a while , and then went to bed . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share my quarters I was disappointed ; he settled down on his rug with the air of a dog who has finally established his right and proper place , even if it did take a while to get the idea through to his dullwittedhuman . We both slept through the night in perfect contentment . I did n't hear the owls wailing in the dark or remember the proximity of the thing in the closet , staring into the blackness with hollow eye sockets.  |p170WE  SLEPT SO SOUNDLY THAT I , AT LEAST , DID N'T WAKE UNTIL SHIRLEYopened the door and Elvis ran to greet her . " This looks like one of those pads I used to hear about , " she said disapprovingly . " I do n't know how you can stand being in this room , Julie . It 's so dark and gloomy . " " Mrs. Danner does n't like it either . " I sat up , yawning and rubbingmy eyes . " The way she acted yesterday you 'd have thought I had asked her to clean a medieval torture chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Her expression was not one of fear or disgust , but of increasing puzzlement . " It 's not that I feel scared , or anything like that ... I do n't know what it is . Gloomy . Sad ... " " It suits me just fine . " I followed her to the kitchen . " Sorry I overslept , Shirley . We 're out of bacon ; how about scrambled eggs for breakfast ? "  | " Miz Martha has a fancy for hot cakes , " Shirley said , taking milk and eggs from the fridge . " Sit down , Julie , till you wake up . " " I do n't know how to make hot cakes . I did n't buy a mix  --  " " You kids and your mixes . Do n't take offense , child ; you 're a heap better cook than Miz Danner , but  --  " " But that 's not saying much . I 'm not offended , Shirley , I humbly admit the truth . " " It 's not your fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating them briskly . " Did n't your mama teach you ? " " According to Mother , she never lifted a ladylike finger to manual labor . The servants did everything . " " Servants my foot . " " No servants ? " " Oh , they had girls come in to help out  --  my own mama worked here for a while . But there has n't been any money in the family for a long time . And at that , things was better when your mama was growing up than when Miz Martha was a girl . " " I suppose you heard about those days from your grandma , " I said , amused . " You know how it is in a small town . Everybody knows everybody else 's business . And the Carrs were always important people , whether they had money or not . " " Why were things better when Mother was growing up ? " " Well , you know Miz Martha married a cousin  --  same last name . He was an insurance man over at Pikesville , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this old barn of a house , but they got along all right . Miz Martha 's daddy was something else . Never could keep a job . Guess he thought a Carr was n't supposed to work for a living . An ' if you think Miz Martha is hard to get on with , you should have known her mama . A real tartar , she was . Kept those girls close to home . They had to do all the housework , and they had hardly any beaux , ' cause nobody was good enough for one of the Carr girls . It 's no wonder the youngest run off the minute she got a chance . " " But Martha stayed . " I was fascinated by this glimpse into my family history  --  a far cry from the hints Mother had dropped of graciousliving in the ante-bellum style . It was easier for me to believe in Shirley 's version , and the image of Martha scrubbing and cooking and never going out on dates satisfied my mean streak . " That kind of treatment takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some rebel and break away . Some just fall intop172the same pattern as their folks , and that 's what Miz Martha did . My granny said it was scary to see her turn into the spitting image of her own mama  --  same way of talking , dressing , doing her hair . Mr. Carr died when the girls were in their teens , so there was just the three of them here . Granny felt real sorry for Miz Melissa  --  she was the youngest  --  alone with those two sticks . Now , Julie , you watch what I do . The trick to good hot cakes is n't in the mixing , it 's in the cooking . " It looked easy when she did it and the results were divine  --  I ate three . I had a feeling they would n't turn out the same way when I did it . I had never been able to make pancakes , even from a mix . They always stuck to the frying pan . I offered to give Martha her breakfast so Shirley could eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your nightie , " Shirley said dubiously . " Then she 'll have to lump it . " Martha scrubbing , on her hands and knees ... She could n't intimidate me . I added , " Eat . Even I know there 's nothing worse than cold pancakes . " One advantage to Martha 's difficult speech was that you had to concentrate in order to understand her and so , if you did n't concentrate , you could n't understand her . I felt sure her comments had to do with my state of undress and my generally rotten attitude toward life , but I did n't concentrate , and when she saw what was on the menu she stopped bitching and devoted her attention to eating . " I 'll take the tray down , " I said , when she had finished . " Back in a minute . " Shirley was washing the dishes . I told her I had a proposition for her . " You want me to set with Miz Martha this morning ? Glad to . If you 're going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get eggs , sure . But what I was going to do was paint . " " That room ? Honey , what do you want to do that for ? " " Because I 'm going to sleep there . I can keep Elvis with meand  --  " " Yes , I know , you told me all that . Well , you suit yourself . How would you like to have Ron paint for you ? It 's not that I mind setting with Miz Martha , but you should n't be doing work like that . " " I 'm a damned good painter , " I said , wounded . " As for Ron , I 'd be glad to have him do it , but  --  well , to tell you the truth , I do n't have the money to pay him . I 'm broke . " " Ca n't you get some from Matthew ? "  | " That is my intention . But I do n't know how much I can wangle out of him . " Shirley snorted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces with food and ask for more , then yell when you tell ' em you need money for groceries . Ron do n't have to be paid right this minute . You want me to ask him ? Might be he could do it this morning . " " Can you call him ? " " He 'll be here pretty soon , with my car . I let him have it yesterday . Promised he 'd bring it back last night , but ... " " After what happened the last time , I do n't blame him for not wanting to come around at night , " I said , smiling . " Anyhow , I 'll ask him . " " Okay . If he can do it this morning and if he does n't mind waiting for the money . . . Matt is supposed to come this evening . I 'll hit him for the cash then . " " This evening ? " Shirley sounded surprised . " Oh , I suppose it 's to do with the Judge 's death . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ephemeralis our presence in this world , so soon forgotten ... When one is old there are few to remember or to care . However , I reminded myself , it 's no better when one is young . I should have been finished with Bleak House , but for the past couple of days I had been cheating . Whenever Martha dozed off , I slid my paperback mystery out from under my shirt and read it until she roused herself and asked why I had stopped . That morning she finally caught me . I was so absorbed in the mystery that when she mumbled , " Read , " I did . " The body lay in a pool of blood on the library rug . Its lovely Bokhara pattern was stained a more deadly crimson . The girl 's white bosom ... " I stopped and looked up to meet Martha 's black stare . " Whoops , " I said . She asked , if I understood her correctly , " What is that trash ? " I showed her the cover . The victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the place . " Hmph , " said Martha . " Now , Martha , admit it  --  you 're as sick of Bleak House as I am . I 'll bet you know it by heart . How about a nice murder for a change ? " I could have sworn she was amused . Such was the distortion ofp174her features that the gleam of humor did n't improve her looks appreciably , but it made me feel more kindly toward her . Maybe I had done her an injustice ; maybe there was warmth and kindess buried under the layers of frigid rectitude that were not entirely her fault . At any rate , she allowed as how she would n't mind listening to Murder on the Hearthrug , so long as I started back at the beginning . The only disadvantage to the new book was that it kept her awake . I finally excused myself on the grounds that I ought to start lunch . I found that Shirley had been to the store and had put together a ham pie crowned with cheese biscuits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiltily . " In money and time . It 's not fair for you to do the cooking . " " I cook better than you , " said Shirley . " I ca n't deny that . Well ... " The smell of the pie overcame my scruples . " We 'll take turns . Where is Elvis ? I 'd have expected to find him drooling at the door . " " Ron took him along to the store . He ran out of paint . " Ron and Elvis returned in time for lunch . The young man greeted me with a sheepish grin , and neither of us marred the occasion by the slightest reference to our first meeting . Nor did I comment on the fact that he and Elvis were now on first-name terms . Shirley took Martha 's lunch up , and Ron and Elvis and I finished the ham pie . Ron also polished off a pint of chocolate ice cream and a box of cookies , assisted by Elvis , and then we went to inspect his painting . He was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the closet door was slightly ajar . I had warned Shirley about the cast , and asked her to tell Ron not to touch it for fear of an accident . Evidently his curiosity had got the better of him . I could n't blame him , but I thought I had better reinforce the warning . " Do n't bother painting the closet , Ron . There are shelves up , and some fragile objects inside . If it  --  if anything got broken , I 'd be in trouble . " " Sure , right . " He avoided looking at me . I left the dishes for Mrs. Danner and started for the dig . I left Elvis , too ; with Ron and Shirley at hand , I figured it was safe . I had warned Ron not to let him eat anything ; from the quick , oblique look Ron gave me I knew Shirley must have told him about Mrs. Danner 's dog stew , but he did n't say anything except that he would keep an eye on Elvis.  |p175I  felt sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sneaking a peek at the skull ; but as I picked my way through the tall grass I wondered whether he might not know more about the original of that skull than he cared to admit . I could understand Jarboe 's reasons for believing that local juvenileswere responsible for the placement of the skeletons . A gang of kids could have gone into the woods to get drunk or smoke pot or dig for treasure  --  or all of the above . If they had discovered the skeletons they might have thought it would be funny to scare someone , especially if they knew Joe Danner would probably be the first person along that road . Joe was obviously not the most popular man in the county . Ron could have been one of the gang . At the least , he must know or suspect who was involved . I wished I dared ask Ron to come clean . It would have relieved my mind considerably to know there was nothing more sinister involvedthan the weird sense of humor of some pie-eyed teenagers . This time there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was received with flattering enthusiasm by all concerned . " Just in time , " Jono said , smiling . " We 're going to sink our first trial trench . " The cleared area was divided into squares , with the now familiar stakes marking the intersections of squares and balks . They must have worked their collective butts off to get so much done . The trial hole was six feet from the grave Mrs. Hornbeak had found . The diggers were not using shovels ; squatting , they removed the earth with trowels , inspecting every clod of dirt as if it might contain gold . Sidling up to Alan I murmured , " I 'm ready to start as soon as you get the stuff . " I did n't realize how ambiguous the statement sounded until one of the female acolytes turned from her digging to give me a long , hard stare . Alan said abstractedly , " I 've got it . What 's that , Willkie ? " The large young man stared stupidly at the clump of dirt he held . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he shoved Willkie out of the way and took over the digging . The hole was only a foot deep when he stopped . He handed the trowel to Jono , who was beside him ; like an operating nurse attending a surgeon , Jono replaced the trowel with a brush . Finally Alan said in tones of deep disgust , " Damn . Another grave . " " What 's wrong with that ? " I asked . One of the girls laughed in a sneering way . Alan returned to his careful scraping without comment . It was Jono who explained . " I toldp176you , Julie , we ca n't disturb burials until we have legal permission . Besides , we know there were burials in this area . What we want now is evidence of occupation . Foundations , rubbish pits  --  " " Get started on the second test hole , " Alan said , without looking up . " You know where . " Jono left reluctantly . He might pretend to be professionally blase about graves , but he was as curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far end of the cleared area , on a direct line with the first hole but fifty feet away . Alan sat back on his heels and beckoned me . " Have a look . " It was not a pretty sight . The skull lay bedded in the dark soil . The mandible had dropped , so that the mouth was wide open , as if the person had died screaming . " Well ? " " Well , what ? " I pointed . " It 's a human skull . " " Male or female ? " " How the hell should I ... " I leaned over for a closer look . " Sizablebrow ridges ... I 'd guess male , but it 's impossible to be sure without examining the pelvic and long bones . The incisors are n't shovel-shaped , so it 's probably not an Indian . The damage to the skull  --  " " Do n't touch it , " Alan said sharply . " We 'll have to undercut the soil and lift it out in a block . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you going to say about the damage ? " I tried to remember old lectures . " It 's broken on the left side . Pressure from earth heaped on the body would n't result in lateral damage , but . . . This is ridiculous . I ca n't tell anything from half a skull . " " Hmmm , " Alan said . He began trickling dirt back into the hole . " No point in excavating any further until we 're ready to take it out . Jono ? " " Pottery . " Jono 's voice shook with controlled excitement . " Practicallyon the surface , Alan . Looks as if there was an old animal burrow here  --  groundhog , maybe . " " Okay . It may be a rubbish dump . Be careful . " The unskilled help  --  which , to my chagrin , included me  --  was put to work enlarging the cleared area . Later in the afternoon I was promoted to sifting dirt . Every square inch that came out of the hole had to be put through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be lost.  |p177From  the tense silence , broken only by muffled exclamations of pleasure , that reigned over the actual excavation , I could tell that Alan and ' one were delighted with the results , but I found the whole business as boring as I had always expected I would . By the end of the afternoon we had a handful of pottery fragments and a few scraps of rusty metal . The hands of my watch reached five o'clock and moved on . Alan showed no signs of stopping work . Finally I announced I had to go . " My materials , " I said , poking Alan in the back to get his attention . " In the Jeep . " " And where is the Jeep ? " " There . " One arm flapped briefly . They had not been able to bring the vehicles to the site , since a deep gully intervened . It had been bridged by a couple of planks , over which I crossed with some trepidation . The Jeep was there , and Alan 's van . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked for , plus a shopping bag that contained modeling clay and a gross of yellow pencils . I picked up the bag and started for the house . Elvis was lying by the back steps . He informed me he had not been fed , so I did that first , then took the supplies into my room . Ron had finished . The place looked nice , if you did n't examine the woodwork too closely ; neither Ron nor I had thought it worth-while to scrape off all the old paint . The closet door was closed , as I had left it . I assumed Mrs. Danner had come and gone , though there were no signs of her presence . The pot of chicken and vegetables simmering on the stove smelled like Shirley 's work , thank goodness . I went upstairs to tell Shirley I was back . She put down the book from which she had been reading ; I was amused to note that it was not Milton or Tennyson , but my murder mystery . Martha asked where I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no point in denyingit ; I was covered with dirt and leaf mold and bits of vegetation . I had expected Martha to express disapproval , but her reaction was a good deal more vehement . Her hand moved with something close to normal quickness , the fingers crooked like claws . " Told you , " she spat . " Years ago . . . stay away . . . filthy , dirty ... " " Take it easy , Martha . I know I 'm a bit grubby , but I fully intend to wash . "  |p178We  had finished eating before Matt showed up . I was reading Murder on the Hearthrug , but without pleasure ; the section Shirley had read contained several vital clues , so I had no idea what was going on . I had left Martha 's door open , and when I heard the car I closed the book . " I want to talk to Matt for a few minutes , " I informed Martha . " About expenses and things like that . I 'll send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted Matt right now . I smiled sweetly and closed the door as I left . I must be mellowing , I thought ; I almost felt sorry for her , sputtering and helpless and unable to enforce her dictates . Matt 's first remark was not " Hello " but " I ca n't stay long . This is damned inconvenient . What does she want me for ? " " She does n't confide in me , Cousin dear . I suppose it has to do with legal complications following the Judge 's death . " " Well , I ca n't do anything yet , " Matt grumbled , following me into the parlor . " He wo n't even be buried until tomorrow  --  " " The funeral is tomorrow ? Where ? " " Carrsville , the Episcopal church . Why ? You are n't thinking of going , are you ? " " One of us ought to be there . Martha ca n't go . Besides , he was a lovely man . " " Naturally I ordered a floral tribute , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually , it would be a nice gesture . If you do n't mind representing the family  --  " " I will even wear a dress instead of jeans . " " Wow . Are you sure that is n't asking too much ? " His smile disappeared when I went on to the next subject . " Money ? How much ? " " My God , you sound like a husband , " I said disgustedly . " Here , have a glass of sherry . " Matt produced a feebler edition of his original smile . " You do n't have to get me drunk , Julie . I know it costs money to run this place , and God knows I owe you . I 'm just not sure I can draw on Martha 's account right now . The Judge and I were co-guardians , and until the court decides who is to succeed him , or whether to grant my petition to act as sole  --  " " For crying out loud , what are people in Martha 's position supposedto do while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " The law , " Matt said sourly , " does n't give a damn . However , I 'll see what I can do to expedite matters . In the meantime  --  will you take a check ? " I was about to say no , when I decided I might get more out of him than if I insisted on cash . After I had the check in my hot little hand I graciously dismissed him and watched him head for the stairs like the schoolboy in Whittier 's poem , dragging his reluctant self to school . I figured I had at least half an hour , maybe more , if Martha was in a garrulous mood . I settled down in the kitchen and looked through the reference material Alan had given me . He had photocopied not only the tables but the entire German monograph . My German is n't too good , but since most of the vocabulary was technical I was able to make it out . The tables were still a basic source , though they were almost ninety years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstructions , including one of a settler from Martin 's Hundred , a site excavated by the Colonial Williamsburg people . I wondered if it was this example that had given Alan the idea . I took the papers to my new room . Ron had piled the odds and ends of furniture on top of the mattress and covered the whole lumpy pile with a drop cloth . It was lavishly spattered with yellow and white paint , like bird droppings . The table was covered with newspapers . I cleared them off and took the cast from its shelf in the closet . Reading the material had fired me up ; I was anxious to get started . With a soft pencil I began marking the places where the depth markers would be set . Heel of the mandible .. . I was so absorbed I did n't hear him coming . His exclamation startled me ; I let go of the cast and bumped the table , setting it rocking . I managed to grab the skull as it rolled toward the edge , and turned , cradling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , " Damn it , Matt , do n't do that ! If this had been smashed  --  " And he said , " What the hell is that ? " We stared at one another in mutual indignation . " A present from your boyfriend ? " Matt inquired sarcastically . " In a way . " I relaxed ; after all , no damage had been done . " Isuppose it did look weird , but if this had broken . . . I 'm doing areconstruction of that skeleton  --  the one Danner found in the road . " The room and the corridor beyond lay deep in shadow , except for the bright circle of light from my lamp . Matt 's features were indistinct . I saw a gleam of white as his lips parted , but he did n't speakp180for a while . Then he repeated , " Reconstruction ? " " It 's a process of restoring the person 's original appearance . Clay is molded over the bone , following tables of average tissue depths on the human head . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Matt said . " You do n't know about skin color or eye color or whether the person was skinny or fat  --  " " It 's only an approximation . But you 'd be surprised what an accurate likeness can be achieved . " " Is that right ? " Matt came closer and looked curiously at the cast . " Are you going to do it now ? " " No , I was just fooling around , getting some ideas . It 'll take days . " I put the cast in its bag and returned it to the closet . " First I have to measure and cut the depth markers , then glue them to the skull , then  --  " " Each to his own taste , " Matt said , stepping back to let me pass out of the room . " Is this where you 'll be working ? I 'd forgotten this room was here . " " It 's convenient , " I said , somewhat vaguely . I had no intention of telling Matt I meant to sleep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and I was afraid Matt would lecture me too . Matt followed me to the kitchen . " Where is your boyfriend ? " " Do n't keep calling him that . " " Sorry . I was under the impression that you two had picked up where you left off . " " Well , we have n't . I 'm doing some work for him , that 's all . " " I 'll have to have a talk with him . " " What about ? " " Stopping work . Martha 's got wind of what he 's doing , Julie . I do n't know how she knows , but she does , and she 's furious . Your ... Petranek will have to leave . " " Matt , you ca n't do that ! He 's just made a big find  --  something really important . " " I do n't care if he 's located Blackbeard 's treasure . I 'm kicking him out . " I was surprised at the extent of my distress . A few days earlier I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to work at Maidenwood or not . In fact , I 'd have been happy to have him off the premises . Now I was involved . With the work  --  and what else ? I searched for an argument that would carry weight with Matt . " It wo n't look good for your image if you shut down the dig justp181as they are finding something significant , Matt . Who are you to stand in the way of scientific achievement ? " " Damn . " Matt dropped into a chair . For the first time he looked older than his true age . " I 'm going crazy with all these unreasonable demands and conflicts . I do n't know what to do . " " It 's not that difficult , Matt . Just tell Martha  --  " " She 's crazy , " Matt muttered . " Senile . She 's talking the most insane garbage . . . Sometimes I think she does have supernatural powers . How does she know everything that goes on ? " " You really are in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Matt laughed  --  a mirthless rattle of sound . " You 'll never know , Julie . " " I do know . " I patted his hunched shoulder . " Do n't let her get to you , Matt . There 's a simple explanation for her seeming clairvoyance , and I think I know what it is . Mrs. Danner . " " Rosie ? " What an inappropriate name for that poor frozen wraith of a woman ! " Rosie , " I repeated . " She has n't a brain cell she can call her own , Matt . She 's scared to death of Martha . I 'll bet she 's been getting the newspapers for her , and answering all her questions . " The more I thought about it , the more I was convinced I had found the explanation . I only wondered why I had n't figured it out before . Matt did not appear cheered by the theory . " That could be , " he said listlessly . " It does n't really make any difference . Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch . " I had to sympathize with him . No one knew better than I the power Martha had wielded over her unlucky descendants . SHIRLEY WAS DISAPPOINTED SHE COULD N'T GO TO THE JUDGE 'S FUNERAL . I hated to take advantage of her , but there was no way we could both go , and Shirley agreed with Matt that someone ought to represent the family . I preferred not to think of it in such formal terms ; " representingthe family " implied white gloves and a hat , neither of which I owned . Still , I wanted to go . I was late , since I did n't know where the church was . The servicep182was underway when I slipped breathlessly into a back pew . I was surprised to see the place was almost full . I should not have been surprised ; he had been a public figure known to three generations . I did n't spot Matt until we rose to sing a hymn . He was one of the first on his feet  --  right up in front , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stayed in my seat until he saw me , then joined him . " Late as usual , " he said out of the corner of his mouth , his head decorously bowed . " I thought you were n't coming . " " Changed my mind . " " Are you going to the cemetery ? " " No . Let 's have lunch . I want to talk to you . " That had an ominous sound , but I saw no reason to turn down a meal . One of the reasons why I had been late was that I had stopped to cash Matt 's check . I had an argument with the teller , and it was not until one of the bank officials recognized me as Martha 's granddaughterthat I was able to get the money . We came out of the dimness of the church into bright sunlight . Matt had taken my arm and I stopped when he did , blinded by the light . When my vision came back I saw the inevitable photographer . Matt always seemed to have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired them himself . I refrained from making a face at the camera , out of respect for the Judge , and let Matt lead me to his car . His idea of a restaurant turned out to be a drive-in on the highway , and I grumpily accepted a cheeseburger and shake , which we ate in the car . " Why ca n't we go inside ? " I complained . " It 's hot as hell out here . " " I want to talk privately , that 's why , " Matt said . " Take a look at this . " He unfolded the newspaper that lay on the seat between us and thrust it at me . Alan must have gone straight from the dig to his office and called every newspaper in the state . He had even rated a minor front-page headline in the Washington Post . " A New Light on Virginia 's Dark Ages . Spectacular New Discovery at Maidenwood Plantation . " " Plantation , yet , " I said admiringly . " That 's pretty fancy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under me , " Matt said through his teeth . " Read the last paragraph . "  |p183After  some fulsome and only mildly inaccurate predictions as to what the new discoveries would mean to historians , the reporter had quoted Alan . " ' Virginia owes a special debt of gratitude to Mrs. MarthaCarr and her grandson , the distinguished senator , Matthew Ellis . Without their gracious permission and unfailing support , this magnificentcontribution to the cultural and historical traditions of the Old Dominion could never have been made . " Through my peals of laugher Matt exclaimed , " You see what he 's done ? I ca n't make him leave now . " " No , you ca n't . His next interview would deplore your strange indifference to tradition , history , and the Old Dominion . He 'd probably have the president of the University and the Governor backing him up . " Matt growled and bit savagely into his hamburger . " So what are you going to do ? " I asked . Matt swallowed . " What can I do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly . Listen , Julie , if you 're right about Rosie Danner , I 'll have to get rid of her . I ca n't have her blabbing everything she knows to Martha . " " There 's a theory in espionage circles that you do n't dispose of a spy , you feed him false information . " " Oh , come on , Julie , do n't be cute . You ca n't tell Rosie your buddies have gone when everyone in the neighborhood knows different . Rosie and her husband have always been under Martha 's thumb . If she told Joe to shoot a trespasser he 'd blast away . " " She 's not very bright , " I said , reluctant to abandon my idea . " If we told her ... " Then , belatedly , the implications of his last sentence sank in . " Rosie . . . Joe Danner . . . She 's already told Martha . She .. . Start the car , Matt , hurry , I 've got to get back . " " Why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulping . " Martha must know about Elvis . "  |p184I  FORCED MYSELF TO DRIVE AT THE SPEED LIMIT , THOUGH MY FIRST IMpulsehad been to make for Maidenwood as fast as the old car would go . I could n't believe I had been so stupid . Martha had known about the dog for some time  --  probably from the first . I had suspected the Danners of trying to poison him , but I should have known neither Joe nor Rose would take such a step without being prompted . Martha would n't give up after one attempt . She 'd tell Joe to try again  --  another method this time , a rifle or a car . Shirley could n't protect him from that sort of thing ; she assumed , as I had , that the first attempt had been the result of idle malice , and that the Danners would n't dare try the same trick twice . I could have cried with relief when I turned into the drive and saw Elvis lumbering to meet me . He would always limp , although he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stop and opened the door for him . He was surprised but quite pleasedp185when I threw both arms around him and hugged him until he wheezed . Shirley was in the kitchen , her feet up on a chair , reading Murder on the Hearthrug . " I finished it this morning , " she explained a little guiltily . " Got me kind of curious ; I figured I 'd read the beginning and find out how it all happened . Was there a good crowd at the service ? " I sat down and told her all about it  --  the eulogy , the hymns , the size of the crowd , the number of " floral tributes . " She asked if I had seen hers  --  " Lilies , in a nice pot , with a purple ribbon "  --  and I improvised . " It was right in front of the casket , Shirley . " " Was Matthew there ? " " Yes , we had lunch afterwards . That 's why I 'm late . I owe you , Shirley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just trying to get by . It 's been a lot easier since you got here , I can tell you . " " That reminds me . " I lowered my voice . " Mrs. Danner is upstairs with Martha , is n't she ? Then I can tell you ... " Shirley was n't interested in Matt 's dilemma with regard to the dig  --  the archaeological activities had always seemed more than a little absurd to her  --  but her eyes widened when I explained that Mrs. Danner must be the source of Martha 's uncanny knowledgeability . " That old devil , " she exclaimed . " I did wonder , now and then , when she 'd let something slip . . . It was n't me that told her , and it was n't you , so who else could it have been ? " " Matt and the Judge are the only other possibilities . But I do n't believe either of them would play informer . Matt does n't want her to know he has gone against her wishes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Upset ? " Shirley sniffed . " It has n't hurt her one bit . She enjoys having her little secrets . " " You 're right about that . As I see it , we 've got three choices . We can get rid of Mrs. Danner . At first I was in favor of that , but now I 'm not so sure . She 's not worth much , but she does give you a break from Martha now and then . The second possibility is to let Mrs. Danner stay and stop playing games with Martha . She knows everything we 're doing anyway , so why bother lying ? " " Hmmm , " said Shirley , impressed by my logic . " What 's the third choice ? " " To go on the way we 've been going . Let Martha think she 's fooling us . So long as we know Mrs. Danner is blabbing to her , we can take precautions . "  | " Maybe that 's the best way . Miz Martha can fuss all she wants about the archaeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The only thing is ... " Her troubled dark eyes moved to Elvis , whose head was resting on her feet . " Yes , " I said . " For two cents I 'd confess to Martha and tell her that if anything happens to Elvis  --  " " You 'll do what ? " Shirley shook her head . " The way I see it , Julie , it does n't make any difference whether you tell her or not . Only thing we can do is never let that dog out of our sight . " Elvis knew the word " dog . " His tail thumped in acknowledgment . Shirley went on , " It 's a good thing you decided to stay downstairsat night , I guess . You can keep him with you . I do n't like to think Miz Martha would stoop so low as to order somebody to feed him poison , but ... " " You 're right as always , Shirley . That reminds me  --  I want to make a phone call . " May Rubin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " she said . I knew from the tone in her voice that it was bad news , and my heart sank . I had hoped I was wrong . I did n't recognize the name of the chemical . May translated . " It 's a weed killer  --  not the standard commercial variety , but stronger . A lot of farmers use it . Do you have any idea  --  " " A lot of ideas . No proof . " " Is there anything I can do ? " " Thanks , May . I 'll let you know . " When I told Shirley she did n't look surprised , only grimly determined . " That wo n't happen again , " she said . Even though I had half expected it , the confirmation of my suspicionsmade me furious . " I 'm going to kick that woman out of here right now ! " " That wo n't do any good . It is n't Miz Danner so much as her husband . " " A man who would beat children and throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice about shooting a dog , " I agreed . " Well , we 'll just have to cope . Which reminds me  --  I got some money out of Matt . How much did you spend on groceries the other day , and what do you think I should pay Ron for the paint job ? " We agreed on a figure that sounded uncommonly low to my cityaccustomedears , and then I started for the dig . I took Elvis with me.  |p187A|p|parently  Alan had got his court order . He and Jono were at work on the first grave , the one Mrs. Hornbeak had found . The bones had been exposed and they were undercutting the entire mass of soil , preparatory to lifting it out . Watching the work was a newcomer , inappropriately dressed in a tweed jacket and neatly pressed slacks . Alan hoisted himself to his feet and advanced to meet me , smiling . This demonstration took me so by surprise that I gaped at him . " Here she is , " he said . " Our physical anthropologist . Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographic Society . " Oho , I thought , and also , aha ! No wonder I 'm getting all the sweetness and charm and professional courtesy . Physical anthropologistyet . Mr. Wilkes stepped carefully around the open grave , his hand extended . He wore glasses , from which the sunlight twinkled , and there were streaks of gray in his brown hair . " It 's a pleasure , Miss Newcomb . Alan is fortunate to have assistance from a lady who is not only qualified , but who is also a member of one of Virginia 's old respected families . " " No , not at all , " I mumbled , trying to restrain Elvis , who could n't make up his mind whether to help with the digging or greet my new friend . " What a handsome dog , " said Wilkes . " Tie him to a tree , will you ? " Alan said , trying to keep the irritationout of his voice . " I 'd like your advice before we try to lift this . " He knew that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procedure , but I realized this was all part of the plan to impress a potential donor with our dedication and our expertise . If my cooperationcould get Alan the grant he wanted , I was willing to do what I could . I handed Elvis 's leash to Jono and knelt by the grave . " Fascinating , " I said . " I know you ca n't make a proper examination under these conditions , " Wilkes said . " But I would be most interested in any preliminarycomments you might feel justified in making . " The preliminary comment that leaped to mind was a simple " yuck . " This skeleton was even more battered than the other one Alan had found . Many of the bones were disarticulated ; the mandible stuck up at right angles . All the remains were darkly stained . " You understand I would hate to commit myself to anything at this stage , " I began . Wilkes and Alan made encouraging noises . I went on , " The skel/etal material appears to be that of a male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the long bones of the legs , and the fact that the hook found in this grave had come from male clothing . The upper teeth were in fairly good condition ; all were present , none were worn , and the wisdom teeth had erupted . " He was probably between eighteen and thirty years old , " I said . " Laboratory study can narrow it down , but right now ... " " Yes , I see . " Wilkes sounded impressed . " I do n't suppose there is any clue as to how he died ? " Alan did n't nudge me , he just got very , very quiet . I knew what he wanted me to say . Most of the settlers at Maydon 's Hundred were killed during the Indian Massacre of 1622 . If I said that one of the breaks in the battered skull appeared to have been made by a tomahawk , or that there was evidence the man had been scalped , Alan would be a giant step forward toward the confirmation of his theory and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had already qualified my comments to the point of meaninglessness , and as for risking my reputation  --  how can you risk what you do n't have ? Something held me back . I would like to think it was integrity . " No , " I said . " I could n't say , at this point . But you 'll notice that the mandible  --  the jawbone  --  has been displaced . Pressure from the earth might be responsible for a certain degree of displacement , but this is extreme . It suggests that the mandible had been broken before the body was buried  --  perhaps that the body was in an advanced stage of decomposition before burial took place . " " Most interesting , " Wilkes breathed . " Well . I have a long drive ahead , and I must be on my way . I had n't planned to spend so much time here , but it has all been most  --  er  --  interesting ! " Wilkes and Alan went off together , and I heard Wilkes say , " You will hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I ca n't guarantee how the committee will respond , but I can assure you that insofar as I am concerned ... " The rest of his words were lost as the two men moved along the track . Jono 's lips parted in a wide grin and he gave me a thumbs-up signal . " You think he 's got it ? " I whispered . " Looking good . You were a big help , Julie . Good work . " When Alan returned , his assessment was more cautious . " I 've learned not to uncork the champagne until the check is in my hands.  |p189But  if it does work out , Julie , I owe you a glass or three . Thanks . " I was beginning to preen myself when he added critically , " Did you have to bring that damned dog ? " " Yes , I did have to . Can you take a break ? I have a couple of things I want to discuss with you . " " I suppose so . Come on , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon . Alan gave them a worried look . " Make it snappy , will you ? I want to get that skeleton out this afternoon . Rain would ruin it . " " Well , excuse me , " I said . Alan stared at me . Then he gave himself a little shake , and I realized he was so tired he barely knew what he was saying . No wonder , if he spent his nights watching out for burglars ... I was about to apologize when he beat me to it . " Sorry . I 'm a little preoccupied these days . What 's on your mind ? " " Well ... First , congratulations for foiling Matt . Or was that newspaperstory a case of coincidental timing ? " " I figured he 'd be getting cold feet about letting me excavate , " Alan said coolly . " The old lady is bound to know what 's going in , with Rose Danner under her spell . " " If you 're so clever , why did n't you warn me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , Mrs. Danner must have told Martha about him too . " " So ? " " So Martha hates animals . Someone gave me a kitten once  --  from a litter his barn cat had  --  and she . . . " To my horror I felt my throat close up . I had n't thought about that incident for fifteen years . " I did n't know that , " Alan said . I turned away from him , struggling to get myself under control . That 's the trouble with amnesia ; when memory does return , it is as fresh and painful as if the event had just occurred . For a moment I thought I felt something brush my bowed head ; but when I turned , Alan was n't even looking at me . He said quietly , " I 'll keep the dog with me during the day . He wo n't like being tied , but he 'll have to put up with it . Shut him in your room at night . I 'll also have a word with Danner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thank you . Maybe I had bettertalk to Mr. Danner . I 'm one of the elite to him , and he does n't think much of you . " " As you like . I have to get back to work . Are you going to stick around ? "  | " 1 thought I 'd start the reconstruction , unless you need me for anything in particular . " " Oh , that . Sure , go ahead . " His ardor for that project had obviously dimmed . Now that he had a genuine find to show the men with the money , the reconstructiondid n't interest him any longer . " I 'll leave Elvis with you , then , " I said , getting out of the van . " Okay . Oh  --  one more thing  --  you 'd better put that barricade back up at your gate . " " Reporters ? " " Could be . But I was thinking of Mrs. Hornbeak . Her nose may be a trifle out of joint and she may approach you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think Alan heard me . He was heading away as fast as he could go , back to his rotten bones . I went the long way around , down the track to where it joined the road , and so to the gates . The sawhorse , with its warning sign , stood where I had left it when I drove out that morning . I dragged it back into place . It was not much of a barrier . And I doubted that the moral effect the sheriff had mentioned would move Mrs. Hornbeak , who appeared to be sadly lacking in rudimentary manners , much less morals . It was the best I could do , however . I still had n't made up my mind what to do about Mrs. Danner . We had to have someone . Shirley was working for wages , Matt could impose on her to the extent she allowed  --  and she obviously had a soft spot for him , heaven knows why . But I was damned if I would let him make a slave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger to Elvis . I checked the mailbox to see if the mail had come . It had . Most of it was circulars , but there was a letter from Mother and a postcard from a friend who was vacationing in Europe , blast her . And one other item addressed to me  --  a five-by-seven manila envelope thick enough to contain a booklet or brochure . But the address was handwritten , and I recognized the writing . To receive a letter from the dead gives you an uncanny sensation . I stood turning it over in my hands , noting that the postmark bore Monday 's date . Either someone had found it on his desk and put it in the mail , or else the old lawyer had posted it himself , late Sunday evening . The latter seemed the most likely alternative ; if he had meantp191to wait until Monday before mailing it , surely he would have left it unsealed until he had finished the note he had been writing to me at the moment of his death . I sat down on the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller envelope inside , crisscrossed by heavy tape . A letter had been attached , in such a way that it covered the flap of the inner envelope . The letter was brief . " My dear Julie . Enclosed is a small memento I think you should have . I know I can trust your honor not to open the envelope until after your grandmother is gone . With most sincere regards , et cetera . " Curiouser and curiouser , I thought . I was n't tempted to peek , partly because I felt sentimental about honoring the old gentleman 's final request , but mostly because I suspected what the " memento " was . He had n't asked me not to feel the envelope ; my fingers traced the outline of what could be a cardboard photo frame , one of the oldfashionedvariety with fancy , curved edges . Perhaps it was a picture of me in my misspent youth , or of me and my parents . I could think of a number of reasons why he might not want Martha to know he had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Danner was in the kitchen . She was n't doing anything , just sitting , staring blankly into space . When I entered she got clumsily to her feet . " You did n't say what I was to do . I do n't know  --  " " That 's all right , Mrs. Danner . " I wished I could dislike the woman wholeheartedly and completely , without any weakening touch of pity . But it was n't possible to hate someone that miserable . No wonder she was reluctant to sit with Martha . She could no more resist Martha 's demands than a gourmand can turn away from a chocolate eclair . She was in trouble whatever she did . " You want I should start supper ? " My sympathy vanished . She could n't be that stupid or forgetful . She had her own little ways of hitting back at the people who hassled her . I wondered how she got back at her husband . I put her to work washing lettuce and vegetables for a salad and went to inspect my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on the cast , there was a lot to do before I could begin the actual reconstruction . I needed a large , sturdy table , and some arrangementto hold the cast steady . And a bed . I was not keen onp192sleeping on the floor . There were mice in the house and snakes outside the house and I was afraid one of them might decide to go for a stroll across my stomach . There was a big oak table in the library . I could n't move it alone , so I enlisted Mrs. Danner . The ease with which she hoisted her end gave me an odd feeling . I had not realized she was so strong . I also stole a rug from the library  --  a beautiful old Persian rug , so worn it was n't worth selling  --  which is probably why it was still there . Its faded gorgeousness improved the look of the room so much I threw caution to the winds and hauled in all sorts of things , including a brass bed from one of the upstairs rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Mrs. Danner did n't ask a question or make a comment . She was about as much company as a robot , but she had a machine-like utility , and by the time we finished I had made up my mind what to do about her . I did n't really care what she told Martha . The only thing I was concerned about was Elvis , and Martha already knew about him . When five o'clock rolled around and Danner 's truck rolled up , I was lying in wait . I think he had been expecting a confrontation , and was only surprised it had not come earlier . Not that he appeared embarrassed or apologetic . He did n't even turn off the motor and I had to yell over the untuned rattle-and-chug . I did n't mind yelling . " You know I 've adopted a dog , " I began . I had to wait some time for a reply . Finally his lips parted . " Miz Martha do n't want animals around . " " That 's between me and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many unauthorized people wandering around here at night  --  " " Miz Martha said I could  --  " " Miss Martha is n't in charge here now , I am . She 's old and ill and she wo n't be around much longer . Senator Ellis will own Maidenwoodafter she dies , and I 'm acting by his authority . If I catch you anywhere on the premises after dark , or if anything happens to my dog , I 'll swear out a warrant . Is that clear ? " He gave me a long baleful look before lowering his eyes and grunting a reluctant acknowledgment . Mrs. Danner did n't speak or move , but she enjoyed his humiliation . I could almost feel her glee ; it puffed her cheeks with laughter she did not dare express . I knew she would pay later  --  not for her disloyalty , but for my tirade . Joep193Danner would vent his rage on an object that could not fight back . Feeling a little sick , I stepped aside and waved them on . Before the old blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . Joe Danner had not replaced the sawhorse . I could n't blame him for that , but I swore under my breath when I saw that the driver of the car was the middle-aged reporter . I went down the drive at a run and waved him to a stop some distance from the house . " Do n't bother to get out , " I said . " Just turn around and leave . " I guess journalists have to develop hides like coats of mail . Smilingand unperturbed , he offered me a folded newspaper . " I thought you might not have seen the evening edition , Ms. Newcomb . " I took the paper . " Thanks . Now go away . " " What do you think of the discovery of  --  " " I never think . See here , Mr.  --  " " Miller . Chris Miller . " " You 're wasting your time with me , Mr. Miller . My cousin , SenatorEllis , is Mrs. Carr 's representative , and Dr. Petranek is in charge of the dig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to the grounds , which I do n't , I could n't , and I do n't know anything except what I read in the paper . " He asked me more questions  --  all beginning with " What do you think "  --  but I stood my ground , smiling and shaking my head . Finally he gave up . I followed the car to the end of the drive and dragged the sawhorse back in place . When Shirley came downstairs I was drinking bourbon and reading the paper . I had had a hard day , and what I read did n't improve my disposition . The paper was the latest edition , the ink damp enough to stain my hands . Matt must have called a reporter as soon as he left me , and hopped onto the archaeological bandwagon driven by Alan . He had even used some of the phrases I had quoted ironically that morning . " Magnificent contribution  --  historical tradition  --  the Old Dominion ... " As I read on , amusement replaced my annoyance . Matt had had no choice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . He was a smooth talker , all right ; platitudes rolled from his tongue like water off a greased pig . The only time he came close to losing his temper was when he was asked about the astonishing psychic discovery of Mrs. Hornbeak . " ' Pure coincidence , ' the Senatorp194snapped . " Lady Jocelyn was dismissed as a charming legend . " ' She is part of the traditions of Maidenwood , but historians have assured me that there is no factual evidence for her existence , much less her presence at Maidenwood . Mrs. Hornbeak has let her overheated imagination run away with her . " I was chortling over this when Shirley came in . I showed her the newspaper , but she refused to read it . " It 's all a pack of nonsense . I just hope Matthew can keep those reporters away from here . They get on my nerves . " " One of them was here a little while ago . " I folded the newspaper and rose . " I got rid of him . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is not going to appreciate Matt 's comments . " Perhaps our barricade did deter Mrs. Hornbeak . She called instead of coming in person . At first she was gently reproachful . " We are accustomed to being ridiculed ; but you , Ms. Newcomb , must realize that coincidence can not explain my success . I would like you to tell the reporters ... " She went on in the same vein for some time , despite my denials and interruptions ; toward the end of the discussion her voice became shrill and her manner very close to abusive . I had just hung up the phone when something hurled itself against the screen door and I saw Elvis . We had an enthusiastic reunion on the steps . He obviously shared my feeling that we had been parted too long . Alan sat down on the steps . " How about offering me a drink , if you can stop slobbering over that mutt ? " I decided to overlook the pejorative comment in view of his contribution to Elvis 's continued survival . " Let me feed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee outside . The sun hung low over the wooded slope to the west , and a ruffle of rainbowcoloredclouds framed its orb . There was the faintest trace of a breeze . " Have you seen the paper ? " I asked , offering it . Alan smiled sardonically as he scanned the story . " Your cousin is a smart politician . Stupid man , smart politician . Have you had the press here ? " " One . I 'm getting pretty good at running them off . Mrs. Hornbeakwas n't as easy to put off . " " She was here too ? " " No , she telephoned . I wish you and Matt would deal with your own enemies and stop foisting them off on me. "  |p195Alan  smiled wickedly . Leaning back , he braced his elbows and lifted his face to the breeze . His hair clung damply to his forehead . " She said something , though , that got me to thinking , " I went on . " That her discovery was too accurate to be dismissed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those acres of wilderness , how could she pinpoint the spot so neatly ? " " No doubt you 've thought of an answer too , " Alan said peaceably . " Spirit guides ? " " Bah , humbug . " " My sentiments exactly . " " Do n't you ... Do you believe in any kind of . . . well , of survival ? " I was afraid he might laugh at me . Instead he said seriously , " There 's no easy answer to that one , Julie . I am willing to accept the possibility that the spirits of the dead might try to communicate with the living , if there was an urgent need , or a strong commitment . What I ca n't believe is that they would waste their time swapping cliches with a horse 's ass like Polly Hornbeak . " " Nicely put . " " Thank you . So what 's the explanation for her success ? " " Obviously she has access to information you do n't have . " " I would n't say obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pompous bastard , " I said , without malice . " Where could she have found it ? " " Again , there are several possibilities . They have a rather impressivelibrary at the Institute . " " Yes , but it 's another possibility that worries me . What if she found her information here ? " " Where here ? " " Huh ? Oh . Alan , this house is full of junk that has n't been sorted for decades . There could be material in the library , in the attic . . . I do n't think anyone has broken in since I arrived , but who knows what went on before that ? " " Oddly enough , that possibility had also occurred to me . " " Well , you 're damned cool about it , I must say ! Were n't you the one who read Matt the lecture about leaving three defenseless women unprotected ? " " I doubt that anyone will bother you now that you have the dog , " Alan said , with maddening calm . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of subject caught me by surprise . " I have n't startedp196it yet , " I muttered . " I had to get the room arranged . " " Let 's see . " He rose . I displayed my interior decoration , and Alan was kind enough to approve . He was amused by my makeshift stand for the cast : a porcelain cachepot , which cradled the rounded cranium . " Not bad , " he admitted . " That will do for a start , but I 'll get you a proper stand . " He seemed disposed to linger , but I showed him to the door , explaining that I had to relieve Shirley . " You 're not really nervous about burglars , are you ? " he asked . " I am not nervous ! I possess a reasonable degree of logical concernabout the subject . Mrs. Hornbeak was really furious . Suppose she decides to come back and have another look for secret docu-ments ? " " I would suggest something if I did n't think you 'd bite my head off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You mean let you look first ? " I hesitated only briefly . " I would n't mind , Alan , but the only place I can let you explore is the library . Martha would hear you if you moved around in the attic . " His lip curled , but he said only , " You had better check with the senator first . I do n't want to get arrested now that I 'm on the verge of something big . " Martha gave me a hard time that evening . She acted like a child who is trying to postpone the moment of bedtime . She wanted a glass of ice water and a cup of tea and she wanted me to have a cup with her and she wanted toast and the first piece was too dark and the second piece was too cold ... The final demand was for her sleeping pills , but I balked at that ; I had agreed with Shirley that she should be solely responsible for administering Martha 's medication . When Shirley finally relieved me I collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still early , so I decided to work on the cast . I had already marked the measurement points and begun cutting the markers . The latter was a finicky job , because they had to be accurate to a millimeter . Gluing them in place did n't take long , but it was close to midnight before I finished , and I knew I ought to get to bed . Yet I hated to stop . It would be a good many hours before Ip197could get any sense of what the woman had looked like , but I was beginning to feel quite possessive about her . I took out the modeling clay and started the next stage  --  connecting the markers with strips of clay , laying a foundation on which the final modeling would be made . The skull looked really weird by the time I finished . The bands of interconnecting clay resembled the helmet of a Viking warrior or a futuristic Star Wars fighter . It was n't until I stopped that I realized how tired I was , and I decided to leave the cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a cat instead of a dog , I would n't have risked it , but he was not in the habit of jumping onto tables unless there was food on them . I let him out for a moment , and as I waited in the doorway I saw a light  --  not a flickering , distant warning of trespassers , but the square of a lighted window . Alan had not said he planned to sleep in the shed , but I knew the light must be his . It shone steady and unconcealed , and I will candidly admit I was glad to see it . Elvis finally came back in . I gave him his dog biscuit ; he crunched it appreciatively while I locked the door . We were both asleep within five minutes . I woke with a start , every muscle taut and quivering with the urgency of the dream that had broken my slumber . The dream had been shattered too ; nothing remained of it except that sense of desperateneed , and a lingering sound  --  a soft , weak wailing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long weeping . I knew I was awake , but it seemed to me I could hear it still  --  the saddest , most heartbreaking sound I had ever heard . Tears filled my eyes and trickled down my cheeks . And then at last  --  or so I thought  --  I came fully awake . The sound was not that of a baby crying . It was the dog . My cheeks were still wet with tears as I fumbled across the tangled bedding in search of Elvis . A dog growling in the night does n't do a lot for a person 's nerves , but it was better  --  anything would have been better  --  than that forlorn weeping . Finally I found Elvis 's collar . He hushed at my whispered command , but I could feel his entire body quivering . The night was still . There was no breeze to rustle the branches of the shrubs outside the window , not even a cricket or a tree frog chirping . I had no doubt that Elvis had heard something , and after a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the house . Thep198door of my room was solid oak , an inch thick , and it fit tightly into the frame . The sound came from outside  --  a metallic scraping at the back door . Still holding the dog 's collar , I slid out of bed . The shrubs outside the window screened off the moonlight and for a moment I was completely disoriented . I could n't find my flashlight or my shoes . It 's funny how defenseless you feel in your bare feet . I could n't have located the door if the dog had not pulled me in the right direction . He was practically choking , he wanted so badly to bark . His presence calmed my nerves . He was a combined burglar alarm and defensive weapon , but I did n't want to use him in either capacity . If the burglar entered the house , he or she would have to pass the door of my room on the way to the front hall . I had no intention of going on the offensive , with or without Elvis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight visitor was . I reached for the doorknob . My fingers had just closed over it when I felt it turn . It had never occurred to me that the intruder would come into my room , and it scared me so badly that I retreated as far as I could go , and huddled at the foot of the bed , clutching Elvis in my arms . The door opened . A beam of light , slender as a sword blade , invaded the room . It fell full on the skull , with its grotesque tracery of clay . I almost screamed myself at the sight . The person in the doorway let out a soft hiss of breath and started forward . Elvis had obeyed my orders like a lamb up till then , though it obviously went against all his instincts . This was too much . His barkingexploded in my ear and he squirmed free . I sat down ignominiouslyon my bottom . I do n't doubt that the person with the flashlight said something as the dog launched itself at him , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wobbled and fell and went out . I heard a sharp cracking sound that I took for a shot , and a yelp from Elvis . That brought me to my feet . I plunged forward , straight into the footboard of the bed . The top of the post crunched into my diaphragm and my big toe connected with the bottom of the post . It hurt more than I would have believed possible . My yell of pain was drowned in the general uproar  --  smashes and crashes and the frantic barks of Elvis . He was still alive , at any rate . As I nursed my aching toe I heard footsteps beat a rapid path toward the door . He  --  she  --  it  --  whatever  --  was getting away . Elvis went after him . The rapidity with which the vol/ume of his barking diminished suggested that pursuer and pursued were setting a good pace . I started to follow . My foot came down on a sharp object that seemed to pierce it to the bone . Complicated as it sounds , the whole business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to take a lot longer . As I hopped toward the door and the light switch , I could n't understand why no one had come to my rescue . The racket should have aroused everyone for miles around . I had just switched on the light when I heard running footsteps returning . If I had been able to lay my hands on a heavy object I 'd have brained the newcomer , but luckily I could n't find a weapon , because the newcomer was Alan . He was fully dressed , including his heavy work shoes . He held a rusty crowbar . I swayed toward him ; he dropped the crowbar and lifted me clean off my feet , holding me so tightly his arms seemed to restrain rather than support me . " Julie  --  what ... Are you  --  " " Never mind , " I yelled . " I 'm all right  --  go get him ! " The arms that held me relaxed . I could n't see Alan 's face , since his chin was pressing down on my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged gasp that might have betokened relief ... or exasperatedlaughter , or .. . " There ca n't be much wrong with you . Quit kicking , will you ? There 's blood all over the place . Did he  --  " " He did n't touch me . I stepped on something sharp ... Oh , damn ! The cast  --  it 's smashed to smithereens . And Elvis is gone , he chased him out , he 'll get shot  --  " Alan lowered me onto the bed and knelt , taking my bleeding foot into his hand . My lament over Elvis ended in a bleat of pain as his fingers gently probed and squeezed . " I want to make sure there are no fragments of glass in the wound , Julie . You must have stepped on the broken glass from the flashlight ; the edges of the cast are n't sharp enough to make such clean cuts . His flashlight , I presume ? " " Or hers . Ouch ! Alan , stop fussing over me and go look for Elvis . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard shots or yells or barks , or something , if Elvis had caught up with the guy . Where do you keep your first-aid stuff ? " Fortunately for my blood presure , Elvis came back before Alan had finished bandaging my foot . At my shriek of joy he leaped ontop200the bed and allowed me to embrace him . He looked awfully pleased with himself  --  the Heroic Dog in person . Though he was covered with dirt and dry grass , there was not a mark on him , nor , to my regret , was there a convenient fragment of cloth caught in his teeth . " Hold him till I get this glass cleaned up , " Alan said , and proceeded to sweep the floor while I watched . " I 'm sorry about the cast , Alan , " I said . " I should have put it in the closet , but I was so sleepy  --  " " I 'll have another one made , " Alan said curtly . " I 've got the mold . " " You may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvis , " but you sure helped him make one hell of a mess . " As soon as Alan had finished sweeping , I got up . " Where are you going now ? " he demanded . " I 'm going to shut Elvis in the kitchen and then check on Martha . " The first thing I saw when I opened Martha 's door was the horrid gleam of a white eyeball . She appeared to be sound asleep ; but the sound of the door opening , soft as it was , roused Shirley in the next room . She appeared in the open doorway , her wide eyes reflecting the glow of the night light . " Miz Martha  --  " " She 's all right . I just looked in to  --  ah  --  just looked in . Sorry I woke you . " Shirley padded to the bed and bent over Martha . " Yes , she 's sleeping . " She straightened and looked at me ; though she spoke in a whisper , the hurt dignity in her voice was unmistakable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd wake if I heard her . " " I was n't checking up on you , Shirley  --  honest . I just ... Look , I 'll explain in the morning . Go back to sleep now  --  please . " I retreated , feeling like a worm . I 'd apologize and set things straight in the morning ; there was no need to ruin what was left of Shirley 's repose . I had heard that nurses can train themselves to sleep undisturbed by extraneous noises , and to rouse instantly at the slightestsound from their patients . Mother claimed she had done the same thing when I was little . When I got downstairs Alan was making coffee . He offered me a cup . I shook my head . Reaction had set in ; I felt myself shaking all over and I was afraid I 'd drop the cup if I tried to hold it . Alan gave me a sharp glance and placed the cup on the table . " Drink it . It 's half sugar  --  you need a stimulant. "  |p201What  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell me there was nothing to be afraid of . But I 'd rather have died than say so . I had only imagined that Alan 's first spontaneous embrace held anything more than normal concern . Maybe if I had blubbered and clung to him . . . Well , it was too late now . Besides  --  I assured myself  --  I would n't resort to that kind of emotional entrapment . Alan was watching me . I sat down and drew the cup toward me , slowly , so it would n't spill . " Are you feeling better ? " Alan asked . His voice was cool and disinterested . " I 'm all right . " " He wo n't be back tonight , " Alan said . " It will be light in a few hours . Why do n't you go back to bed ? " " I could n't sleep . " " Do you want me to stay ? " Did I want him to stay ! " I 'm sure you have other things you 'd rather be doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the sun rises I 'll take the dog and try to track your burglar . No sense blundering around in the dark . " " Who do you think it was ? " Alan shrugged . " It could have been one of several people . " After he had gone I sat staring at the closed door . A core of icy cold had settled around me . One of several people ... including Alan himself . It would be a perfect cover-up for an intruder  --  to turn on his tracks and return as the heroic rescuer.
