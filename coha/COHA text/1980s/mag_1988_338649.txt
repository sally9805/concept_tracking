Rain in the ninth inning of a baseball game is usually no cause for celebration , especially if the home team is losing . But when drops started falling in Kansas City last week as the Royals tried to catch the Chicago White Sox , 23,000 fans let out a rousing cheer . No wonder they were delighted to get wet . Missouri is deep in the heart of drought country : some 80% of its corn crop and more than 60% of its soybeans are in poor-to-very-poor condition . In Chicago the news that scattered showers were sprinkling the blistered Plains and Midwest created a near panic in the commodity pits as traders rushed to retreat from the sky-high futures prices they had been paying during the bone-dry days of late June . <P> But a few showers were far from enough to break what meteorologists describe as the most devastating dry spell in 50 years . If the drought stretches through the summer , its economic effects could prove as far-reaching as a cloudless Montana sky . Any sizable increase in inflation is still remote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from cherries to Christmas trees , breakfast cereal to beer . While farmers fortunate enough to have a healthy crop will enjoy the windfall of higher prices this year , the shriveled overall yield could reduce U.S. agricultural exports in the long run by losing market share to foreign competitors . <P> Most notably for consumers , the cost of food is going up . The Government reported last week that prices paid to farmers for grain crops rose 3.7% in June alone , after increasing 6.1% during the first five months of the year . Since January , soybean futures prices have risen from $4.70 per bu. to more than $10 , and traders are talking about " beans in the teens " by year 's end , which would break the record high of $12.90 reached during a shortage in 1973 . As a result , the Department of Agriculture now estimates that food prices will rise between 3% and 5% this year , but those estimates may prove optimistic . John McMillin , an analyst for the investment firm Prudential-Bache , foresees a possible double-digit increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will start with the raw material and pass through to finished products in ways that consumers may not expect . Corn , for example , serves as the basis for everything from cattle feed to margarine , and the crop is severely threatened . If below-average rainfall persists through mid-July , when the plants are pollinated , up to half of the crops could be lost . The sale of stockpiled crops from previous years will mitigate the effects of the drought , but rising corn prices are already putting pressure on cereal makers . General Mills last month boosted the retail prices of its breakfast brands 5% . Kraft is charging 8% more for its soybean oil-based margarine . <P> The winter-wheat harvest escaped the effects of the drought . But the spring- wheat crop in a belt from Montana to Minnesota , which accounts for one- fourth of the year 's total harvest , may amount to only 250 million bu . That is less than half of last year 's level . Result : consumers are likely to pay higher prices for pasta , much of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persist through the summer , the same will hold true for soybean- based foods , which range from trendy tofu to salad dressing .
