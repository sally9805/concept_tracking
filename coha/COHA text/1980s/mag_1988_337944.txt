A June Sunday dawns at Doug and Audrey Graves ' summer house , which sits on choice island property that has been in Doug 's family for three generations . Doug , 54 , is spending the weekend at this retreat , away from the city where he desultorily practices law and enthusiastically philanders . Audrey , 51 , ensconced for the season and steadily tippling vodka in the privacy of her own bedroom , feels a bit edgy over the arrival , a week earlier , of their unprepossessing son Bobby and the stranger he introduces as his new wife . Audrey wonders whether Lydia , nee Di Salvo , the daughter of a prosperous private trash collector , will be able to live up to the lofty standards of manners and deportment that prevail in the Graves family . Still , the weather is sunny and warm enough to soothe implicit tensions . And everyone is looking forward to another marvelous breakfast prepared by the houseguest of the past week , Chuck Burgoyne . <P> Nothing in this scene overtly suggests the imminence of comic catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their crash helmets and fasten the safety belts . Newcomers are advised to follow suit . The Houseguest , Berger 's 15th novel , picks up some of the pieces scattered by the explosive anarchy of his Neighbors ( 1980 ) . Once again , an apparently stable domestic setting warps and buckles into chaos , and kindred characters struggle to adjust to a world in which the outrageous has suddenly become the norm . <P> The first thing that goes awry this fine Sunday morning is that Chuck oversleeps , leaving the promised breakfast unmade and each of the Graveses peckish and unsettled . When he finally appears , the man who has so far embodied " Doug 's idea of a perfect houseguest in all ways " behaves oddly . He takes advantage of a moment alone with Doug to confide that one of Doug 's recently ditched mistresses has been threatening to make trouble , but then assures his host , " This is something that requires no effort at all on your part . I 'll see it 's taken care of . " <P> Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " With all respect to the young man , it did not seem right that he would assume authority in this matter . " Indeed , the effrontery rapidly escalates . Before long , Chuck is in Doug 's bedroom demanding a signed blank check and displaying ( accidentally ? ) a holstered revolver strapped around his ankle . Doug is shaken by this experience . " How 's that for a Sunday at the shore ? " he complains to his daughter-in-law . " You can get your head blown off for no reason , by a houseguest you do n't even know . " <P> It turns out that none of the Graveses has invited Chuck ; each assumes that he is another 's friend . By the time they make this discovery , though , it may be too late . Having committed improprieties ranging from theft to sexual assault against individual family members , Chuck seems to be planning something supremely unpleasant for the Graveses as a group . Both phone lines are mysteriously out of order , and neither of the two cars on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night falls ?
