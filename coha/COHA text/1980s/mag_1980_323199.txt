Only minutes after James Callaghan announced his resignation , Denis Healey rushed to stake his claim to the Labor Party leadership . Healey , 63 , the candidate of the moderate right , certainly rates as the people 's choice : a new public opinion poll shows him 33 percentage points ahead of his closest rival . But his mandate is less clear among Labor M.P.s , who will vote for one of several contenders . Abrasive and impatient , Healey has alienated Labor 's left , part of its right and even some centrist union leaders . Says a former Cabinet colleague : " Denis is like a Sherman tank blasting opposition out of the way . " <P> Born in Mottingham and educated at Oxford 's Balliol College , where he took a double first in classics and philosophy , Healey served as Defense Secretary ( 1964-70 ) and Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1974-79 ) . His bushy eyebrows , imposing girth and bare knuckle style make him a favorite target of cartoonists , who sometimes turn his teeth into fangs . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tory Home Secretary William Whitelaw , using the caricaturists ' horror-show imagery . " You sometimes get the impression that once Denis decides what is good for Britain and his party , he pursues it even if you have to lie and cheat along the way . " Healey mistrusts ideology , and sees the job of government as mundanely doing what most people want- trying to eradicate poverty , inflation , unemployment and other social ills . " These things are n't very exciting for visionaries , " he says , " but trying to get them is not an ignoble thing to do . " <P> Healey 's intelligence and zest for combat should serve him well if he becomes Labor 's candidate against Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives . " No Tory frontbencher carries Healey 's weight of punch , " says Julian Critchley , an anti-Thatcher Tory M.P . " His brains , bellicosity and bloody-mindedness may be just what the doctor ordered for Labor . " <P> Leading the left against Healey is Peter Shore , 56 , the party spokesman on foreign affairs . Trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shore was elected to the House of Commons in 1964 and later served as Secretary of State for Economic Affairs ( 1967-69 ) , Trade ( 1974-76 ) and the Environment ( 1976-79 ) . With hair that flops over his face , he is an attractive if low-key candidate . He owes his leftist credentials to his opposition to Britain 's membership in the European Community . But he is also a passionate supporter of NATO and the Anglo-American alliance and opposes any form of unilateral disarmament . Says a friend : " Peter is a socialist who is not afraid to say he is British . " <P> Others on the left would prefer Michael Foot , 67 , a fidgety , white-maned journalist who was first elected to Parliament in 1945 . Foot , a brilliant parliamentary debater , is personally popular and thus might be acceptable as a caretaker until Labor 's electoral college can get organized . Another declared candidate is a long shot , former Agriculture Minister John Silkin , 57 , who is also on the left .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
