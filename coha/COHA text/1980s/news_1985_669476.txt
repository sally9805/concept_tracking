The drama involves the spurts and slumps of stock indexes like Standard &; Poor ' s 500 . . . and the steady , considered march of the ' ' 200-day moving average. ' ' // What we ' re dealing with , chartwise , is a long-term , underlying trend of investor bullishness ( the 200-day average still has a nice uphill slope ) and a recent layer of short-term bearishness ( the stock indexes are angled downhill ) . // Which , if you think about it , is sort of like the overall United States economy : Long-term signs continue to look good , but there ' s quite a bit of head-scratching about the current condition we ' re in . At 34 months , the economic expansion is middle-aged , a recent economic report from Manufacturers Hanover Bank notes . Past expansions have ranged from 12 to 58 months . Will the future hold further economic growth , or are we winding down ? // // On those gray financial pages ( it gets a little technical here , so yawns are excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line is near intersection with the S &; P ' s 200-day moving average ; the same with the Dow Jones industrial average. // The lines may cross in the next few trading sessions . The last time they intersected was in late 1984 amid widespread uncertainty about the economy entering a recession. // True , to date the 200-day average is still marching ahead . But with a powerful magnifying glass you ' d be able to see that the leading edge ( which actually corresponds with the daily Dow and S &; P lines ) has been in a slump since hitting all-time highs in mid-July. // The question is : Will the 200-day line be pulled down , too ? // It will take some time if it is ; the market has been on an uptrend for most of this year . But clearly the primary indicators ( particularly the S &; P 500 , the New York Stock Exchange composite index , and the Dow industrials ) are showing weakness . The widely followed Dow closed Friday at 1 , 307. 68 , down 28. 01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market analysts say , has shifted to the negative in recent weeks . The Dow , many feel , will fall back toward 1 , 280 over the next two weeks ; at around 1 , 275 it would cross the moving average. // Still , many market analysts predict a regrouping at about that level and a push ahead to new highs afterward. // Here ' s how to follow the 200-day moving average , according to Richard Yashewski , a chart-watcher at the Butcher &; Singer brokerage of Philadelphia : If stock prices drop but don ' t penetrate the 200-day average , that ' s bullish . If they penetrate but the average is still on an uptrend , that ' s still OK . If , however , they penetrate enough to pull the 200-day average down , ' ' then we ' re in the soup. ' ' // The 200-day average is so important to Wall Street professionals that that alone ( forget the merits of the theory ) makes it worth watching. // Eric Miller , chief investment officer at Donaldson , Lufkin &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent analysis that ' ' many technicians consider the moving average so important that , if it should be penetrated this fall after some months of declining new highs and lagging breadth , they will declare the bull market over. ' ' // Analyst Yashewski is worried about the direction of the market , but he still believes it is going through a correction and will steady around 1 , 280 , ready to assault new all-time highs later this year. // Many institutional money managers , however , have been initiating major selling programs in recent weeks and starting to accumulate cash or cash equivalents . That programmed institutional selling has been a key reason for the market ' s fall in recent days. // ' ' We ' re not expecting much for the immediate future , ' ' says William Fletcher , chief investment officer at Independence Investment Associates of Boston , a subsidiary of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance . There is an ' ' extraordinarily narrow valuation difference between stocks and bonds , ' ' he says , which has brought about a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , then the market rises because of optimism over corporate earnings . But that lasts only a few days , and pessimism returns because of concern that interest rates will rise . And if economic indicators sag , the inverse of those reactions takes place. // Neither guides the market in a sustained direction. // Fletcher ' s firm used that midsummer burst in the stock market as an opportunity to sell , raised cash in portfolios to the 20 percent level , bought some bonds ( where a client authorized it ) , and worked to diversify equity portfolios . Because it is so difficult to discern economic and market directions today , Fletcher says , equities must be examined one by one , with a focus on the earnings prospects of each one. // Similarly , equity strategist Monte Gordon of the New York-based Dreyfus group says that in early summer Dreyfus ' ' sensed problems out there ' ' and raised cash to the 20 to 25 percent level . That was in order both to blunt the impact of the current decline and also ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreyfus may have made its move into cash , Mr. Gordon notes that industrywide measures of cash reserves held by mutual funds , pension funds , and bank trusts are still ' ' very , very low . ' ' And ' ' anytime cash is low , you are near a market top . ' ' Hence he thinks other institutions will have to do what Dreyfus has done - sell and raise cash - before the market can recover. // Butcher &; Singer analyst Yashewski figures a government statistical signal that indicated a ' ' big uptick in economic activity ' ' would spark the market again - especially if interest rates hold steady . **22;44582; <> **44;44606; **42;44652; <> **76;44696; **28;44774; Interest <> <> **76;44804; **28;44882; rates <> **28;44912; Percent <> <> **76;44942; <> Prime rate <> **26;45020; 9. 50 <> <> **76;45048; <> Discount rate <> **26;45126; 7. 50 <> <> **76;45154; <> Federal funds <> **26;45232; 7. 75 <> <> **76;45260; <> 3-mo .
