Calligraphy may be the cure for sloppy handwriting <P> Now that calligraphy , the art of formal handwriting , has become a popular hobby , enthusiasts are sharpening their pens to improve the atrocious scrawling of the rest of us . It will be a mighty task . In America , writing is the most neglected of the three Rs . <P> The basic problem is that the letter forms taught were not designed to accomplish the necessary combination of legibility , speed and ease . At the start , schools require five-and six-year-olds to construct an alphabet out of circles and straight lines . Calligraphers say that it is wrong to expect the resulting letters to resemble the modern sans-serif type faces that the children are simultaneously learning to read . Young hands can rarely produce the subtle but important nuances of printed type . The so-called ball-and-stick method requires exceptional motor coordination , and the effort spoils the handwriting of many youngsters for life . <P> Since drawing circles and lines is not really " writing , " third-graders must be taught writing all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fanciful scripts taught elementary the U.S. in the 18th and writing . centuries , in-the Spencerian style vigorously promoted in the mid-1800s by Platt Rogers Spencer , a scribe and teacher . All these cursive systems , of which the most familiar is probably the variation devised by another teacher , Austin Palmer , are full of accident-prone loops that only a 19th century copper engraver could properly master . Teachers get as discouraged as students . <P> The solution , calligraphers say , is a simplified version of italic , one of the predominant handwriting styles of the Italian Renaissance . It was developed by Ludovico degli Arrighi , a Vatican chancery scribe , who in 1522 composed the first writing manual for popular use , La Operina . Like much Western writing since antiquity , this simplified italic is written with a broad-edged pen , yielding a pleasing alternation of thick and thin lines , depending on the angle of the stroke . It is also easy to write because it follows the natural movement of the wrist .

" We want to teach children an efficient hand , one that is legible , fast and easy to write . For some scribes , that is n't calligraphic enough . But most of us believe there is beauty in simplicity . "
