The President , who had dismissed the affair last Friday as " much ado about nothing , " today asked " anyone with information related to the allegations , " including his own aides , to inform the Justice Department , the White House announced. // The announcement was followed by word from the White House that some Carter materials had been recovered from Reagan campaign files and were being forwarded to the Justice Department . No elaboration was offered , but the White House promised to release this material eventually to the press. // // Copy of Book Requested // The controversy took on a new direction today as the White House asked Carter campaign officials to give them a copy of the allegedly purloined debate strategy book . The former Carter aides complied but marked the copy , contending that Reagan sympathizers secretly filched the same document three years ago from the White House. // " We are hopeful that the enclosed materials will facilitate a thorough investigation that will determine exactly what happened , " Patrick H.

Baker 3d , President Reagan ' s chief of staff , that a black-bound loose-leaf book of information from the Carter camp came to the Reagan debate preparation team from William J. Casey , the Reagan campaign manager , who is now Director of Central Intelligence . Mr. Casey said last week that he had no such recollection . Neither of them has elaborated in public comments. // Larry Speakes , President Reagan ' s spokesman , said today that both parties engage in such intelligence gathering in campaigns . " It ' s the way politics works , " he said . But Carter officials , who made sure that news photographers were alerted for the delivery of the book , contend that the theft of documents from the White House would be a new low . <> <> ' It Looks Pretty Dumb ' // " If this happened in ' 64 or ' 68 , people might understand it , " one Reagan Administration official commented today in conceding that the controversy was a subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the official added , " I ' ve got to admit that , so soon after Watergate , it looks pretty dumb. " // Mr. Speakes contends that Carter Democrats are exaggerating the affair for political purposes and that , in any case , President Reagan did not learn of the secret Carter briefing materials until last Thursday. // A Reagan official said today that the request for the copy of the Carter book was made to see whether it coincides with and might refresh the recollections of campaign strategists who have been unable to say precisely how they obtained the material. // This evening , after Reagan officials had a chance to study the book , the White House issued a statement saying there were " some similarities " to what Reagan officials recall from their debate preparations . But they added that it appeared to be a " far more finished , more sensitive briefing book " than the material they used in rehearsing Mr. Reagan . The statement said Mr. Casey had not had a chance to review the newly received book . <> <> Further Investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the White House as Representative Donald J. Albosta of Michigan , chairman of the human resources subcommittee , made plans to conduct what aides said would be a wide ranging investigation. // The Congressman , who first confirmed that ranking Reagan advisers had used the Carter material , is expected to focus not only on such Reagan principals as Mr. Baker and Mr. Casey , but also on the identity of the so-called " mole , " or informer in the Carter White House suspected of passing along the briefing material . Mr. Albosta learned of the allegations from a recently published book about Mr. Reagan by Laurence Barrett. // David Rubenstein , former deputy chief of domestic policy for President Carter , said he suspected that the informer was one of " two or three " holdover White House employees from the Nixon and Ford Administrations . The former Carter officials have declined to identify the employees in public , and in interviews two of them denied any involvement . <> <> Practice for Debate // White House officials have confirmed that they used secret briefing materials from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s climactic debate in October 1980 . David A. Stockman , who is now director of the Office of Management and Budget , used the Carter camp ' s debating points in playing the role of Mr. Carter in mock debates with Mr. Reagan. // Mr. Speakes carefully avoided saying today that the Administration was ordering a full-scale investigation . He said Mr. Reagan ' s action was a request to the Justice Department to " underscore " his intent , stated Friday , to " get to the bottom " of the controversy. // The White House said then that no special inquiry was planned . But a meeting of Reagan officials was held Saturday , Mr. Speakes said today , and the request to the former Carter officials for the briefing book was later extended by Richard A. Hauser , deputy counsel to President Reagan. // The briefing book sent to the White House today was a black-bound collection of loose-leaf papers , titled Debate Briefing Materials , covering domestic and foreign topics .

For example , the book conceded that Mr. Reagan ' s debating style was " disarming and effective , " and advised Mr. Carter as if the debate were a prize fight : " He tends to stay above the fray , leaving his opponents to try and throw the haymakers. " // Former Carter aides insist that a close reading of the actual debate provides clear hints of how Mr. Reagan used the book to take advantage of Mr. Carter . On an initial perusal of a copy of the book , however , this seems a subjective judgment , difficult to document. // While Mr. Stockman has described the Carter material as useful , other Reagan officials have questioned whether the material they used in 1980 was the same as the strategy book offered today .
