Some weeks after first meeting Bing , and having heard nothing more from him about having that cup of tea , I decided to interview him for my weekly newspaper column , " Texas Gal in Hollywood . " Going over to Paramount ' s " White Christmas " set , I perched on a high stool with pencil and paper while he , looking very dignified in his officer ' s uniform , coolly chose his best camera angle , and filled my pages with utter blarney . Ultimately I managed to conclude the interview on a invitation for tea at Lucy ' s , where we sat in a dark booth , sipping the hot beverage and munching cinnamon toast . This - our first date - lasted only 30 minutes . For the rest of 1953 , I saw Bing only as a performer on the set of " White Christmas . " Jan. 24 , 1954 : Our first dinner date . Bing arrived in his Mercedes , and wewent to Chasen ' s . On either side of us were Phil Silvers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bing . Unfamiliar with the popular music of the day , I didn ' t even know the names of Bing ' s recent records . Fortunately , he didn ' t elect to discuss them , or his sons , either , this time . I learned much later that he had just realized that Gary was older than I. When we returned to my apartment , I didn ' t know what to do . I couldn ' t invite him in . The house lacked a separate living room and had no furnishings to speak of . So I just stood there and looked awkward . Bing took my face in his hands , kissed my noseand each cheek , and jauntily disappeared into the shadows . Friday , Feb. 11 : I picked up the mail at the studio and opened three envelopes that should have been bordered in black : UCLA ' s drama department would not accept me for its degree program because I had left a play in progress to do a USO tour of Korea for Paramount Pictures . My home-town paper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my option . I sat huddled on a bench in the mail room . I had failed , and it was time to return to Texas . When Bing heard my story , he told me he had a friend who was doing a television series . " I wonder if I might give him your name ? " At 11:30 that night the phone rang . " This is Ken Murray , " a booming voice announced . " I ' m doing a television show called Where Were You ? ' I told Bing that I need a couple of recurring characters , and he said you could probably handle an assignment , so I ' d like to meet you tomorrow . " The next day the part was mine . I did not know that Bing Crosby Productions was doing " Where Were You ? " But I realized that I was a very lucky girl . For months I had heard nothing from Bing ; but on Saturday , Oct. 16 , 1954 , he breezed back into town and into my life with an invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cottage , Bing said , " I want to talk to you . " " Come in . " I sat by him on the sofa . He faced me , took my left hand in both of his and said , " I ' ve been thinking about you a lot this summer , and I have a question to ask you when I know what the answer is . " He just sat there and looked at me . When the vacuum became unbearable , I babbled , " Well , Bing , we ' ve known each other for a while now . I think it is very important to have roots . . . . I think maybe we should get to know each other a bit more , but I ' m glad you missed me because I missed you , too . " I curled up next to him and leaned on his shoulder . He scratched my head - not quite behind the ears like a labrador , but something similar . I was getting comfortable , but after a brief pause he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and left . On Oct. 30 , Bing invited me to Palm Springs . After a quiet supper at home , Bing put on a record and we went outside . There was no moon , so we simply sat and stared at the sky . He finally said , " You know , Kathryn , I have done a lot of thinking about you and me . We have started growing those roots that you talked about . . . I mean , if we got married , what kind of life would you envision ? Would it start with , say , a junket around the world ? " " I ' ll get to Rome , " I answered . " But if you ' re talking about a honeymoon after my marriage , I think coming home with the man I love would be the best part . In many ways I ' m not prepared for marriage , but . . . if we could limit the initial cast to two people , I think I could cope . " " Do you mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plaintive , adorable quality to that rich voice that I quite overlooked the simple fact that the snake- in-the-grass still hadn ' t proposed . " Yes , " I said , and I knew then that I would marry Bing Crosby and do everything he wanted me to do , if I could just find out what that was . Whereupon Bing disappeared . I neither saw him nor heard from him for the next two months . Hayden Lake , Wednesday , Sept. 7 , 1955 . Bing and I breakfasted . He was alternately hiding behind the sports page and staring at the telephone . Finally it rang , and he leaped upon it only to bark angrily " Yes . . . no . . . keep trying , " and hang up . Feeling unwanted , I left Bing to his own devices , but at noon he materialized at my elbow : " Kathryn , there is a complication in my life . That ' s what the phone call was about . I can ' t really discuss it with you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . " He looked absolutely miserable . There didn ' t seem to be any point in saying , " Wouldn ' t you like to share your problems with me ? After all , we ' re engaged . Your life is my life . " In point of fact , he had just informed me to the contrary . His life was not my life , and I was obviously superfluous . " Perhaps I ' d better go on home . " " I ' ve already called Ralph Scott . He ' ll have the plane here in the morning . " Oct. 12 , 1955 : Bing invited me to visit him at his Pebble Beach house . After we had walked a while beside the sea , he finally broke the heavy silence between us : " I have to tell you the reason we couldn ' t marry last September . I wanted to confide in you then , but I didn ' t dare . " Horrible thoughts raced through my mind , but I listened in vast relief as he recounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school . In his innocence , Bing really felt he was the only one in the world who could have told me a story familiar in its most intimate details to every bit player , bartender and taxi driver in the Greater Los Angeles area . I had already been asked about this particular dalliance by five different columnists . I had feigned ignorance with all of them . Not one to quit when I am winning , I affected it again with Bing . " You were gone for a very long time , you know , and it started out as just a party after our movie wrap-up - and then I suppose I had too much to drink and one thing led to another . Weeks later , when I told her of my previous commitment to you , she utterly lost her composure . She had always been so calm and serene , but now she wept and screamed at me . I can ' t understand why a woman would carry on like that . It was just terrible . " I listened in silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suicide , public exposure , perhaps a suit for breach of promise . " I had to have her found , to be sure she wouldn ' t carry out her threats . " Bing thought for a while and then added , " I must be rotten to the core to have treated you like this . " We were striding down the beach at a brisk clip while I struggled to stifle my laughter . Here Bing was apologizing for having chosen Olive Kathryn Grandstaff from West Columbia , Texas , over this regal blonde , the most adored lady in Tinseltown ! The old cliches were all true . No man would ever understand his woman . While Bing had to be my first love , I was interested only in being his last . With a superhuman effort I controlled my facial muscles , stopped by a sheltered dune , turned to him and softly whispered , " I forgive you . " Expressions of surprise and relief chased each other across Bing ' s face . He took my hand and started walking back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had chosen me over her ! Well , I could now forgive him anything ; even his all-too-evident lack of taste in women . It would be I , after all , who married Bing Crosby.NEXT : Married at last .
