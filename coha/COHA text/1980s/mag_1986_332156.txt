The National Congressional Club , political lair of North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms , is a money machine that raised $5.7 million to back right-wing candidates in the 1984 election , one of the largest war chests collected by any political-action committee in the nation , conservative or liberal . Last week it suffered a resounding defeat on its home ground . <P> By a 2-to-1 margin , Tarheel State Republicans chose Congressman James Broyhill , a mainstream conservative , over the N.C.C . ' s man , former Ambassador to Rumania David Funderbunk , to run for the Senate seat vacated by another Helms protege , retiring Senator John East . Broyhill promptly announced that he would wage his campaign without the help of Helms ' organization , thank you very much . The continuing bitterness in G.O.P. ranks brought smiles to Democrat Terry Sanford , 68 , a onetime North Carolina Governor , who , in a crowded field of ten candidates , won his party 's Senate nomination with 60% of the vote .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
