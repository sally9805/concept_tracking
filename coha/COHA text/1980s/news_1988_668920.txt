John Randolph , a 14-year-old victim of Hodgkin ' s disease , has grown to associate doctors and nurses with the excruciating radiation therapy that keeps him alive . Chemotherapy has caused his hair to fall out and gives him sporadic bouts of crippling nausea . Radiation treatments have burned the skin on his neck and shoulders , leaving behind patches of rippling pink scars . But on Sunday John got a chance to give his doctors his own brand of treatment at Lutheran General Hospital-Park Ridge ' s seventh-annual picnic for child victims of cancer . " I know the doctors don ' t mean to hurt me ; they ' re the reason I ' ve survived my disease , " said John , as he wound up to throw a softball at a target lever that-if he hit it-would plunge his doctor into a tank of water . " But boy , is it nice to give them a taste of their own medicine , " he said , before hurling the softball . After three unsuccessful throws , John ran to the tank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Kwon into the tank . " Man , did that feel good ! " he yelled , shaking his fists in the air while other children suffering from cancer jumped up and down like victorious game show contestants . The annual picnic is designed to give young cancer victims and their families a chance to mingle with the doctors and nurses in a festive environment , said Margaret Palkover , a Lutheran General nurse who helped organize this year ' s event . " These are kids who don ' t always have a lot to laugh and smile about , " said Palkover , as she dodged a red water balloon . " There is a lot of physical and emotional pain associated with their treatment . We always joke and play with the patients , but this is a chance for the nursing staff and the physicians to have fun in an environment that doesn ' t constantly remind them of their diseases . " More than 50 children and their families attended the Sunday picnic at the Dam One Park Reserve in Wheeling . Some families continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recovered . Others come back time and time again even after their children have died . Marjor Prezembel sat under a shade tree and fingered the program for a 1987 Buffalo Grove graduation ceremony at which her daughter , Debbie , was honored by having a National Honor Society award named for her . A few months later , in August , Debbie , an honor student , died of a brain tumor . " I think when your child is diagnosed , you feel like you are in it all by yourselves , " Prezembel said . " You feel all alone at first , but slowly the physicians and the other families become a part of this big extended family that never really leaves you . Coming back brings back memories , but in a weird way it also helps us deal with our loss . " Jim and Mary Jaskolski bring their 6-year-old twins , Jeff and John , back to the Lutheran General picnic each year to help inspire other young cancer victims . Jeff Jaskolski had one of his kidneys removed five years ago during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of cancer . " Our son is a survivor and I think the other kids need to see that , " said Jim Jaskolski . " They need to see that some people do survive cancer and lead normal happy lives . " Most of the children at the picnic are involved in outpatient radiation therapy and , like John Randolph , have lost all or most of their hair . But the 3- to 18-year-old cancer victims who played softball and jumped up and down on a massive trampoline hardly looked like they were suffering from life- threatening diseases . John is suffering from a relapse of Hodgkin ' s , a disease that attacks the lymph nodes , after a long period of remission since he was first diagnosed with the disease seven years ago . He said the picnic will make it easier for him to go to school at Lincoln Junior High School in Mt . Prospect this fall , where he is sure to face a certain amount of teasing and curious stares . " This helps to take some of the pressure off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a baldheaded 14-year-old . People stare and stuff and they always ask me questions about my height . " The disease has stunted John ' s growth , and at 14 he stands less than 5 feet tall . " Every time I go to school people ask me about my height , " he said . " I get sick of it , so I told them that one day my mom got real mad at me and tossed me into the washer and I shrunk . Some of the kids laughed . Some actually believed it . " " In many ways that ' s what the picnic is all about , " said Mary Cassidy , a Lutheran General nurse . " We want to teach the children that there are things in life to laugh about . That if they learn how to laugh at themselves and let go of their pain once in a while , it will be a lot easier for them to get through it all . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Chris Walker .
