Will Khomeini invade Iraq in order to topple Saddam Hussein ? <P> <P> A mood of jubilation prevailed in the Hosseynieh mosque , adjacent to Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini 's residence in a village north of Tehran . Khomeini , 82 , leaned on two aides as he walked up a flight of stairs leading from his house to the balcony of the mosque , from which he often speaks . In the midst of a rambling discourse on domestic issues , he turned to the subject of his army 's victories against Iraq in the 20-month-old border war . In effect , Khomeini declared that , come what may , he would square accounts with his enemy Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , whom he described as already " dead . " Said Khomeini : " I assure you , this corpse can not be resuscitated . " <P> Khomeini then turned his attention to nonaligned leaders who are scheduled to meet in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad in September . Declared the Ayatullah : " You will earn yourselves eternal shame if you choose a dead murderer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stains of his crimes , even if you use all the oceans of the world . Do n't trouble yourselves . " <P> The Iranian government has inflated its already extravagant demands ever since its army recaptured the Iranian port city of Khorramshahr from Iraqi forces two weeks ago , causing some Iraqi soldiers to attempt to swim across the Shatt al Arab estuary to Iraqi territory . Iran is insisting on the overthrow of Saddam Hussein , payment of enormous reparations by Iraq or its Arab allies , repatriation to Iraq of about 100,000 Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim refugees of Iranian descent , and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from every square foot of Iranian territory . Iran has demanded as much as $150 billion in war reparations from Iraq , although Majlis ( parliament ) Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani pointedly noted that Iran would abandon its claim to reparations if Iraq were converted into an Iranian-style Islamic republic . <P> The next move is Khomeini 's : to invade Iraq or merely to press from a distance for Saddam Hussein 's overthrow . Iran is bolstering its forces along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for invading Iraqi territory . But it is also emphasizing that it does not intend to widen the war to include the whole Persian Gulf , at least not unless the gulf states take hostile action against Tehran . <P> The Iranians have made clear to both the U.S. and the Soviet Union that Tehran will not take anyone 's advice on how to conclude the fighting with Iraq . The Soviets , giving up their efforts to persuade Khomeini to make peace with Iraq , are nervously watching the war and trying to avoid offending either Iran or the Arab states . <P> Like many of its allies , the U.S. was betting that the Iranians would not invade Iraq , at least not now . The argument is that Iran would rather avoid an all-out fight , preferring to launch occasional border raids while waiting for Saddam Hussein to fall as the pressure on him builds .
