 | Urban complex : Morgre . ( The seven levels of the city  --  four of them underground  --  are sunk between a hot - wr and a valley in the Myaluth Range . The upper levels , irregularly spaced at different heights , with their great pylons supporting one atop the other atop the other , are recreation areas , spacious parks .... ) Morgre ? Let me tell you about Morgre. 2 . Among urban complexes it 's the third largest in our geosector , which , in world terms , makes it an astonishingly unflamboyant place . If you come expecting one of the great cities of the north  --  Melchazidor , Ahrun , Katour ( with its Grand Triple Run ) , Eblevelma , or even more southernly Farkit or Hanra'a'sh  --  you 'll be disappointed . I do n't know where the basic design for our world 's urban corn plexes came from . Still , the notion was that , given a certain amount of successful planoforming , the complexes themselves should be ecologically more or less self-contained , which means they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our world , they are . But Morgre 's site was chosen with some care . Where the red rock drape-forms of the Myaluth Range end , a ribbon of hot-swamp  --  the Hyte-wr  --  winds out onto the pitted Vyalou Plain . Dozens of species of indigenous gnats , gold , black , and red , swarm above the Hyte 's brackish sludge . During the day the blue erupting fumes are visible for kilometers . Years before Morgre proper was sunk , several furniture and toolmaking collectives organized themselves along the Hyte-wr 's oestern bank , then called Morgre . ( Oh , yes : for reasons no doubt lost in colonial archives , our world has five points on its compass : north , east , south , oest , and west  --  instead of four or six like most others . ) The industrial collectives used the swamp 's natural heat to run their machines , while the tolgoth trees ( closer to a kind of cactus ) foresting the Hyte-wr 's north shore provided their almost unworkably hard pith for lumber . Processed by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponge-copper and heavier metals were worked into blades , wires , switches , and chips . Chained to their slip-pads  | with the old-fashioned , black , flat-sided links , the orange ingots had been hauled in along a monoline running part of the three hundred kilometers in from Helk'um Port , where the space shuttles still come to on the lavid plains that hold the circular ridges of ancient craters , cloded away over most of the rest of the world . Hie old monoline 's pentalons have been down for fifty years , but their star-form supports are still clamped , in clusters of five , to the pebble-pocked rocksheets . As children , we used to scooter out over the sarb-grass and silvagorse mortaring the porous stones that footed the Myaluths and , wandering among them , guess at what those meter-wide claws grasping the ground could possibly have been , while the black and green coaches of the present monoline whistled above us on humming cables down into the city . The nematode farm at the southern edge of present Morgre claims an unbroken line in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Its founding year is proclaimed in silver letters over its gates : 2,521 Web Standard . Silver is common on Velm  --  about as common as calcium was supposed to be ( according to Family historians ) on Earth . For years , 2,521 was the most repeatedly mentioned date in Morgre 's local facribbons , which , after the six o'clock , two o'clock , and ten o'clock shift-breaks , twisted and blew along the edge of the ground-level alleys where the workers2 discarded them  --  wafting toward the gulping grills of the quietly bellowing cleaners , for all the world like the blue smokes curling over the Hyte . When I was ten ( proportionately more stocky , substantially less hairy ) , I joined a chemistry study-group in which two of my older groupies worked on the wormfarm with their parents . Soon , half the kids in the group had trial jobs2 there . For me , it was sorting spawn samples into glass vials on a dusty plank table , while the shadow of the window pole , from Velm 's larger moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of , first , our larger , then our minuscule , sun . I thought then that the huge cooling pits outside , the racks of ten- and fifteen-meter strainers casting checkered shadows over the broken fields , and especially the dirt clotting the underground support beams holding up the roofs of the kilometers on kilometers of catacombs where most of the adults worked , must all go back to the founding . Everything , including you , stays so dirty on  | half the fun . Later , as a teenager , I saw some pictures of the original farm co-op , c. 2,521 : a bunch of grinning , grimy women , some human , some evelm , in odd-looking work outfits ( bare chests ; oddly paneled skirts ) , toiling on land a fiftieth the size it is now , use hand-strainers and pick-axes on a bit of yield-soil the size of t skene in the Dyethshome amphitheater . Such violence to the known turns home into history . What actually brought Morgre here , however , was the Retreat the Arvin . I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real influence , yet I know ( human ) Family adherents from t north first came to the sparsely populated south and built their retre on the site where a few local evelmi vaguely thought an ancie temple may once have stood . ( Which is the Family in a dyllhull ti you . ) Its glacine cases housed the gold inch , the silver meter , the platinum centimeter bars , the vibrating quartz crystals measuring out nanoseconds and Standard Years , the plastic molecular models of human DNA , all lovingly imported ( supposedly ) from world to world , their origin supposed to be the original Old Eyrth . Completing a swing that had already finished in the north and that had no doubt driven those settlers here , the religious revolution which made the Sygn the official dogma of this world arrived in the south ; but it was carried out in our area fairly peacefully , well before anyone thought to construct a city . A bunch of locals  --  some concerned evelmi , some enlightened humans  --  came round , so goes the tale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get this tasteless garbage out of here ! " and unlike some places throughout the six thousand worlds I could name , there were no staunch objections . ( The riots in the polar caves of Minjin-IX ; the burnings , the mass slayings among the floating labyrinths on the magma fields of Nok Hardrada . . . ) Of course the Sygn wanted to find the name of the deity or dedicatee of the " temple " on the original site : Arvin is Velm 's smaller moon , which by night looks no larger than Iiriani-prime by day . And Arvin was the best they could come up with , since concepts like " temple , " " deities , " " ancient , " " dedicatees , " and even " name " just did n't fit into the local evelmi culture at the time the way humans might have expected . What replaced the imported holy objects in the **43;28;TOOLONG " Retreat of the Arvin " was , among other  | tn ) the earliest vaurine library in the area  --  where , two nunureu Its ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wormfarm , ? tually . Indeed , some of the original measurement standards  --  in it original cases , say the little cards under them  --  were eventually turned to the museum . Since the Sygn is concerned with preserving e local history of local spaces , the Family occupation of the retreat as now part of that history . So there you are . Indeed , I only learned the dogma actually practiced there was part I the Sygn after I 'd spent that year offworld with my Grandmother enya on Senthy . ( The long , thin parks with their sudden curves at e end , where the pockmarked fisherwomen , waiting for work , alked up and down , up and down , under the high transparent roofs fined a perpetual brown by Senthy 's rusty rains . ) There I 'd seen tuals , cyhnks , and services so vastly different from the ones here at me as to be unrecognizable : then the return , to discover that  --  the ygn itself , which is only a name , pronounced a thousand different ays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as : but one of the Sygn 's most widely spread tenets ( and , like verything else in the Sygn dogma , it , too , no matter how wide , does not obtain everywhere ) is that history is what is outside , in both time and space , the current moment of home . And without history , there is no home . A second tenet that usually ( though , like all else , not always ) goes along with the first : when you go to a new world , all you can take of your home is its history . And if you are a woman , your choice is to take it knowingly and be its ( and your new home 's ) silent friend , or to take it unknowingly and be its ( and your new home 's ) loud slave . And " slave " is one of those words in Arachnia that , amidst a flurry of sexual suggestions , strongly connotes the least pleasant aspects of " master . " But even compared to other spots on Velm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our local Arvin produced no famous mystics , no writers of profound tracts , no multivoiced orators , or even thirty-tongued preachers  --  and few brooding sermons . But it served as a cultural and social center for the Morgre area when there was nothing here , beside the Hyte-wr , but a loose association of labor communes and cooperatives , nestled at the foot of the Myaluths.  | Still , many of the primitive statues in the Arvin 's meditation gardens , rich with wood ( pith , really ) , metal , and local gemstones decorating the basic plastine forms , made up in invention and passion what they lacked in sophistication : the itinerant evelm ( and sometimes human ) artists , who traveled from retreat to retreat in those days , leaving a sculpture here or a net-tapestry there as offering for their fare and lodging , had a sense  --  the best of them  --  of what would widen a local 's eyes . When the retreat was moved three hundred meters south to make way for the sinking of Morgre proper , only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The statuary from the other three is now at Dyethshome . ) In my own too infrequent visits to the Arvin , where it currently stands , its pale blue walls set with carved portrait faces , licked over with reddish schist-moss , gazing out onto Morgre 's South Plaza Market , I doubt I 've ever seen more than six people at a time using either one of the remaining gardens for actual inward-communion . But tradition has it that , in the early days , area meetings were held there in which four or five hundred workers2 would come to vote and discuss local and geosector policy and offer replacement ones . Presumably hundreds among them stayed to meditate  --  though where hundreds might lie down to pray , even in five gardens , always puzzled me , since I could visualize no more than twenty people at a time using the ones they still had . The seven levels of Morgre were sunk into the scrumbly stones of the Vyalou in 2,588 Web Standard . Its northern edge just touches the three artificial spurs that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west offer substantial protection from the hotwinds that tear over most of three months through the otherwise balmy climate in this geosector , bringing scalding grit and the stench of acetone all during the season of the pearlbats . Hotwinds make the above-ground parks and recreational levels of a number of the larger urban complexes further oest and north pretty much a joke . Five hundred kilometers away in Farkit they put out warning signs half an hour before a blow is expected  --  and everyone goes underground . Here in Morgre , because of the Myaluths , with goggles and a good sandsuit , humans for an hour and evelmi for three can actually walk around in one , though it 's not fun . And in the same year as the sinking of Morgre , on what is occasionally called Dyeth 's Rise , by Whitefalls  --  one of the three  | Iwuterfalls the Sygn was able to coax from the underground water ' wings about here , whose streams join in Morgre 's Central Park , to flow away and finally mingle with the hot oils of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clays , flanked with topaz cactus , Mother Dyeth , who had just resumed a job- as a foreman at one of the furniture communes and had taken a job as a spiritual advisor at the Arvin , instructed the great offworld ships and cross-country transports that sidled up beside the already bustling cranes and digers and crawlers and loaders furiously laying in the underground levels of Morgre complex ( and the ships and transports all bore the insignia of Vondramach Okk ) to erect the astonishing gift she had been presented with , a gift so large its implication may never really have penetrated to the folk with whom she had worked in this area - five years before . But that 's to get away from Morgre proper and turn to the castle going up  --  and down  --  by the waterfall to the east . And though that castle , Dyethshome , is my home , that 's not yet my plan . 3 . Just off Fayne-run , centered in Morgre 's fourth layer down , Dylleaf Crescent has got to be the dingiest street in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once displayed elegant frescoes . But during a long forgotten industrial overflow , a union lower down had requisitioned the roof for storage space , bolting up their ribbed and rickety gondolas . Eventually some of them had been removed . Some had simply been emptied , but still hung there . A lot of the frescoes had come down with them , so that blotches of dirty yellow plaster now patched what was left of the gray , green , and gold . The street cleaners must have been on the blink again , because facribbons had been trampled into mulch and kicked against the stone walls , too wet and wadded for the air currents to lift and carry toward the waiting grills . ( Sometime soon , tracers2 would arrive with their wide blades to scrape them away . . . . ) I ducked through a stone gate a head too low for me . And I 'm not tall . But the gate had been put up generations ago when it was just  | assumed no human would ever live here  --  though once , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room only meters away . In the dusty floor , six limen plates made a hexagon . Overhead , four of the six viewing lights worked , thrusting misty pillars down from the darkness . I stepped onto one . " Santine , " I called , " are you at home ? " ( At home my own viewing light was n't working so I could n't see who was at my plate . ) " Santine ? " " Oh , just a second , will you . There . . . " and I felt the sensation that is something like rising but more like falling , in a column of light .... " So . " Santine reared up on her hind fours and dropped her black , scaly head to the side . " You 're back from gallivanting about the stars and have decided to pay a world-bound friend a visit . " " Actually , I 've been back for three days . But my job caught me up immediately out at the home and I 've just only been able to try any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in . Come in , and I 'll find us something interesting to suck on . " I stepped off the plate onto the gray and blue clays that stretched off to the hedges of silvagorse and on for desolate kilometers toward the middling cliffs . At the horizon was Morgre , in which I had been only seconds before . The city lay , like a toy of girders and plates , dark and miniature in the west . The sky to its left was still copper . Under indigo air , pole lights stood at half-illumination about the semi-tiers of stone into which Santine 's room was hewn . Out of season , five or six pearlbats flicked at the tallest . Outside on Dylleaf there 'd been the warm bellow of the street cleaners ; here there was natural breeze . " Sit . Sit . " With bluish claws she plumped a pile of cushions covered by an antique web-work tapestry she 'd brought with her from Hysy'oppi in the north , years before I was born . " All safe for you . Sit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while she went to rummage in the white cabinets that stood about the room . " So , you folk out in the prestigious rim of the city have decided to pay a visit to the center . Ah , riches ! Ah , poverty ! " " Oh , come now , " I said . " Someone of your profession ) has been  | y times richer than I five times over . " Santine was a tracer , , and ! exchange was one of the rituals that had grown up here in the iuth to integrate the human concern for wealth with a culture that no concept for **37;73;TOOLONG ( so that it ) k its neuroses out in much more interesting  --  to humans  --  ways ) . ' I 've been meaning to pay you a visit ever since I got back . And w I have ! " Santine found one stone on one shelf , licked it , then found anothered that one . " How 're the rest of the worlds in the universe rolling along , ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so back I was on world called Nepiy ... " But Nepiy took me to another world that no longer existed and that I did n't want to talk about . " Well , they had their problems ! But then , why talk about unpleasantnesses re . Popping around the universe the way I do , the only thing that still surprises me is that there 're so many humans in it . " " Billions , " Santine said , picking up a third stone . " Over how many worlds ? Thousands of worlds , you told me once . " I leaned my elbows back on the cushions . " The truth is , Santine , I do n't have any real concept of how a billion differs from a million . Or a thousand . At least in real terms . No human does . " " I 've heard ? " Santine turned , on her hind legs now , flavor stones on all four foreclaws ? " that , other than by abstraction , none of you can really count above three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " But just for an example , I 've walked into the Dyethshome amphitheater when it was three-quarters full and then again when it was four-fifths full and had no immediate sense of the difference . " The amphitheater at Dyethshome has ninetynine tiers of seats rising about the central skene . I looked about the eleven tiers of stone that rose around Santine 's room , on the bottom of which I was sitting now . " Crowds . . . large numbers . .. " I shrugged . " They 're mostly things one finds today doing metaphorical work in bad poems . " " I suppose it 's because I 'm one of those , " she said with one tongue ; and with another , " women that humans fascinate , in all the ambiguity the phrase allows in our language(s) ? " She added the plural with still another tongue evelmi usually only used for tasting , then picked up the sentence with still another ( whose relation to the  | first l could no longer figure 1 'd blinked ) ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural discourses , does , " and , with another tongue , " does n't it , " and concluded with the traditional tongue for endings : " Yes ? " Then she laughed . " As a foreigner to this city , I know there is a grammatical mistake in there somewhere . Here , my young friend : taste . " With the deep , disturbing rumble that wax evelm laughter , she came to me . I kneeled up to lick first one stone ( peppery , with an aftertaste of mint ) , and another ( the cool inertness of most rocks ) , and another ( the ashy saltiness not of sodium chloride but of some potassium substitute ) . Santine gave me the fourth to hold and taste at my leisure , and I leaned back on the cushions , much more relaxed now that I had experienced some kind of familiar greeting . " Santine , you know what I heard not so long ago ? In the play of the universal machinery , another whole world has met its destruction . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A whole human population ? " somehow I just assumed it was an all-human population ? " was annihilated . " " Yes , you humans do that to your worlds from time to time , do n't you ? " Santine mused . " Were there any survivors ? " She moved off again to her shelves . " There had to be some , " I said . " One . Or a hundred . Or a thousand . " I adjusted myself on the cushion . " Is n't that an awful thing to have to think about while you 're . . . gallivanting about the stars , as you put it ? " " It 's not a terribly pleasant thing to think about while you 're bound to the surface of a single planet , " she said . " Sometimes you do it to other people 's worlds too . " " Mmm ... " " How happy I am that the processes of thought are so different between my race and yours . We love you . " " We love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  indeed , I 'd never questioned what it meant . But it always made me feel good . " How long has it been since I 've seen you now ? " " Not long . To me . Years . Standard . " Santine , instead of sitting , was pawing about in another set of shelves . " And not many of those . And in that time , I have been looking over the book you lent me . " I frowned . " Book . . . ? "  | " I suppose I shall some day become accustomed to , " she declared With one tongue ; and with another , " the religions of you humans : they fascinate me . Only , " and a third took up , as she turned from the shelf with a familiar object in her midclaws , " the book you lent me has little to do with religion . It seems , from all I can find out either from it or from General Info , to deal exclusively with art and life . Which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-year-old , doing knee paintings on rough fabrics about your mothers ' claws : I do not understand your race 's concept of art . Nor am I that secure about my own race 's notions on that intriguing topic . " " Vondramach Okk , " I said , because I recognized the leather , glass , and aluminum volume in Santine 's claws . " I remember loaning it to you . You said you were interested in Vondramach 's religious thought ; so I lent you her poems . I just suspected you might find something in them to illuminate her theological notions . I 've always felt the poems provided an interesting commentary on her religious period . " " Nothing . " Santine clicked her bluish claws on the bluer clay . Where she came from , that was an ironic sign for negation , though evelmi in the very far north make the same gesture for intense agreement  --  while those who grow up near Morgre do n't make it at all . " They suggest a virulent critique of everything religious , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " for humans , the declaration God is dead ' is just as religious a comment as I believe in God ' ; and the infant , innocent of all theology , seems as holy as the studied saint . Do we humans have a broader notion of religiosity than you ? " " Merely less refined . " Santine arched her upper gum ridge , which was a smile . " Vondramach intrigues me because she had tasted the bitterest sins . Such flavors authorize the highest , the deepest , the widest religious feelings that pull us away from all social centers . But these poems , as you call them , are things made with the taloned claw rather than the perceiving tongue . " " I think , " and laughed while I both thought and said it and so probably distorted both processes , " that because you evelmi have more tongues than fingers  --  or taloned claws  --  you will never understand us humans , really . " " And that is why you humans kill us in the north , " Santine declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever heard one .  | well , your Vondramach was a mistress of politics as well as art and religion , yes ? But in those two fields , she leaves me far behind . " I did n't say ( indeed , I probably did n't think ) : That 's why were killing you in the north . Rather I found myself simply uncomfortable with this , from one of my oldest friends . I was about to question this discomfort as diplomatically as I could when Santine lunged forward . " Here is your book . " I pushed myself up on one elbow , took it , and reached for the chain hanging from my waist . " Thank you . " There was a ring on one side of the volume , which I snapped to the ornate clip at the chain 's end-and thought of a row of small yellow lights in the distance . " Oh , " Santine said ; she had obviously thought the same thing . " I think you have a photocall . " " Excuse me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked about for a stone wall . Near the wall , connections are always better . I walked toward the mound of schist beside the lowest tier of seats , and thought through my reception code : " Oh , Marq ! " My mother , V'vish , clasped her foreclaws and declared with two tongues at once : J " Where have you been , Marq ? " l " Where are you , dear ! Please , the Thants are here and we do n't want to insult them ! " I took a deep breath . " Is it formal ? " " Oh , no . Just come home , please . We do n't ask much of you , but we love you . " And with another tongue : " And we 'd love for Santine to come , if she would . " " I 'll ask her , " I said  --  then tried to change my voice a little , which is a habit we single-tongued humans here get into in childhood , but which , except when talking to my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'm on my way . " I turned from the wall as V'vish vanished . " They want you , do n't they , " Santine said . " Do they want me too ? " " They do . Will you come ? It 's an informal party for some offworld friends . The Thants . . . ? But I know you 've met them . " " If it 's an informal affair , I 'll be along in an informal amount of time . Tell your parents , wo n't you , to expect me ? "  | " Yes . Of course . " " Good . " And with her broad , beautiful wings unfurled and bolstersly beating , she shooed me toward the entrance plate . " Get on ith you then , " she cried ; and with other tongues : " Get out . .. ! ( iet out . . . ! " and with still another : " You 'll see me later in the vening . I look forward to seeing you at your home ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night breeze and the air from her ntracting wings , in the midst of the rising fall , joined the roar of dark Dylleaf 's cleaning winds . Up a level , across the park , down one run and along the roller way ? which once had seats but now only has the worn pentagonal spots where the cleats had been removed . Thoughts while rolling through my hometown : On Morgre 's lowest level there are , today , twelve- and twenty-rack vegetable farms , with huge metaquartz light-conduits leading down from the overground parks . There are distilleries for the liquor we make in a number of Velm 's southeast geosectors from the wild sarb-grasses . There are swimming pools , design mills , a dozen fine cheese houses , which still make their various wheels and stars of green- , yellow- and orange-rinded cheese from the fine nematode milk the out-city farm produces . There are ceramic works and aquaria , and what has slowly gained a reputation as the finest manufactory of personal electronic musical instruments in the hemisphere . ( The biannual music festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our world to have their works performed , was one of the joys of my adolescence . ) On ground level and the first sub-ground level , three quarters of the population still lives . Wide alleys twist between and up and down the roller-ramps and stairs about them . Those who live above ground mostly have skylights in at least one of their living rooms . ( Those below , I 've always noticed , have so much more varied holoramas outside their window-walls or in their surround rooms . ) Rolling walks take people beneath the girders supporting the parks above , past the various outlets of the various service unions . Broadlifts are always going up and down , their rails sliding closed ,  | and the young and old women of both races are always disappearing up into , or appearing down from , the upper , vine-hung parks . It 's more or less inevitable : those who work in the out-city communes and co-ops ringing an urban complex always feel themselves slightly superior to those who work within the complex itself , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furniture factory , Dyethshome , or the Farm . . . . Yet there are so many advantages to life within the city  --  more parks , more runs , more pools , more dancing areas , more , and more varied kinds of , sex , greater varieties of social and cultural stimulation , more adventure , and more play  --  that the twin pulls , of prestige in one direction and excitement in the other , keep the general population moving both ways . In an efficient bureaucratic anarchy  --  our most common form of government on Velm  --  there are very few jobs2 that one keeps for more than five years . ( Your job , is another story . ) And since your job is pretty much the one that determines where you live , a good third of the population is constantly moving out to live in the outskirting co-ops when the outer-city jobs2 open up ; or , by the same cycle , are moving in to sample center-city life . And it tends to be a different third all the time . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from Senthy when I first realized that somehow those in my home , Dyethshome , were exempt from this cyclic flow  --  though I 'm sure the council-board who , seven generations before , had authorized Mother Dyeth to accept the gift that Vondramach had offered her , saw it as nothing more than a large out-city commune , even if the idea of a commune that was nothing but a work of art struck them as unusual  --  and might even have aroused downright hostile suspicions in that board 's ancestors on their other worlds . Myself , though I 've lived in Morgre and other urban complexes on Velm ( and off ) many times , indeed loved life in the inner city with the passion of a youngster loosed from the toils of tertiary homework3 , I was always on a labor2-sabbatical when I lived inside , never on a job . My friends there tended to be others with as much free time as I , though they might have been in all or any other jobs2 , inner or outer , only weeks before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where frankly I feel more at home when I 'm working at anything other than my profession , : diplomacy . I 'm not the only Dyeth to whom this applies .  | Because of this , from time to time , close friends  --  like Santineve remarked I have a different manner about me , something other an just my being human . They more or less find it amusing . When I was younger , I would look within myself when women said this , to seek out the pains of being different and to wonder how I 'd been ounded by my isolation in the outer-circle 's older labor co-ops . Yet off-world folk like the Thants take the same manner  --  which for us yeths marks a hurt , a failure , a deprivation  --  and read it rather as a mark of privilege . Which in turn makes us find them somewhat amusing . Among its three free-standing , two-hundred-meter multichrome walls , their transparent panes gone dazzling at Iirianiset , on the eastern rim of Morgre just beyond the blue tiles of Water Alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rushed up the steps across green flags , wondering where the Thants had been on their way to that had allowed them to stop off at southern Velm for a visit . You understand their world is very different from ours . ( Their sun system : Quorja . Their moonless world , sixth out : Zetzor . Their city , called 17 , is blasted among myriads into the rock wall of a three-kilometer-deep canyon that worms and branches and doubles back and rebranches for several thousand k 's about Zetzor 's permanently dark north pole . Yes , Quorja is about sixty-eight thousand light-years around the galactic rim from liriani . ) I 've said that interstellar travel is expensive ? To promote cultural interchange , some of Zetzor 's larger geosectors finance one of their reproductive communes to unlimited fare for travel anywhere about the galaxy . ( Myself , and every other ID , has to get a job , where fare expenses are taken up by the employer , requesting the import . ) Once , I made the mistake of asking Thadeus Thant how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such an honor . Somewhere behind careening metal , she laughed . " Well , considering that we 're chosen from the population of an entire world , you can be sure the selection is n't entirely fair . . . .

Striking up a friendship , they 've been dropping in to see us once or twice a year standard ever since . A visit from the Thants at Dyethshome  --  Death 's Home is how it 's still pronounced , though vowels have shifted and , in the last hundred years or so , space and punctuation have fallen out  --  is ebullient good will , lavish and humorous gifts ( that the Thants buy or have made , by the bye , after they get here .

" I chuckled . " It 's what they used to call a simulated synapse casting . All the soft lights and multicolored flashes inside supposedly reproduce her personality , in crystalline form . " The glimmering pillar rose from its ornate metal pedestal to soar beside the wall decorations next to the blades of the door , till it disappeared into the equally ornate capital , one with the court 's roof , where silver tracery pictured what one evelm artist had thought she 'd seen in our stars . " Shall I tell you the story connected with it ? " Alsrod 's hands came before her to clasp in mimed ecstasy beneath her brown chin . I put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fourth generation of her children . The casting was taken right at the old lady 's demise . A decent length of time after her bodily passing , when it was turned on , so we 've all been told , the capital speaker up there announced : Now , I 'm a mechanical reproduction . Not the real thing at all . I know it . You know it . You were fools to get this thing made in the first place . Frankly , I 'd turn it off if I were you and let me stay dead , ' which was so uncannily like Mother Dyeth in life , everyone was quite astounded at the synapse caster 's skill . " " Did they obey ? " I nodded . " I do n't think there 's anyone among us who knows how  | to turn it on today  --  though when I was a child , sometimes we would stand around , my sisters and I , and all try to put our arms around it , not quite able to touch . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , a very pleased look , " you 're just doing your job , are n't you ? " " Yes . " I smiled , a bit puzzled . " I am . That 's by and large what I mostly work at . " " Does that mean that you do n't really want to tell me such things ? " " Ah , " I said , " but I like my work as well as my work , . And I like my work , a lot . " Then added , because this seemed the moment to do so : " Perhaps we should go back to the others . . . ? " I turned with her to walk toward where her sisters waited on one of the stone benches , while talk trickled about in the hall behind them , between my parents and theirs . Alsrod Thant , the youngest Thant , fourteen standard years now , bony , brown , and delicate eared , her head shaved ? really a rather genial child  --  and this was her first trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with studied modesty that she 'd been to moons before . . . no , not Zetzor 's . Zetzor does n't have any . ) Though she knew us and we knew her from numerous vaurine projections , still it was the first time we 'd met her in vivo . I 'd found her charming . For all the circles in dull aluminum that hung around her neck and waist and shoulders and calves , I could n't help thinking of her as a younger me . I sat . Alsrod sat  --  between her older sisters , Fibermich and Nea . My sisters Alyxander and Black Lars came up at that moment to sit by me . A little ways off , George Thant scowled , arms folded over her big metallic chest , like some colossus from an artistic tradition I was n't quite familiar with . Across the room I thought I heard Thadeus declaim : " A world , you see , called Nepiy . . . " and my attention turned . But Fibermich brought it back with a continuation of some conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Her brown hand hovered and quivered , like an object intended for steady focus , but which , because it held too much energy to remain static , kept blurring into a faster time frame . " We were on Bragenvold , in some northern geosector . Incidentally , they really do n't think in  | geosectors on Bragenvold because the political alliances are between interconnected and interwoven nets of city-states : the Blue Net , the Red Net , the Green Net , the Orange Net . Well , there we were in the capital burg of the Green Net , kilometers underground , and with the capitals of the Red , White , and Tyrian Nets less than a day 's work away with a jackhammer on three different sides of us . ( Oh , they are labor-intensive in those underground caves . And the people in handarm intensive societies look so different from those in leg-foot intensive cultures  --  do n't you find ? ) As we rowed down the city 's central canal , there was a circular facade , carved into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painted above the narrow doorslits , in the local color-code syllabary : Do not profane your origins on Eld Eyrth . " Fibermich and her seated sisters rocked in unison , laughing their different laughs at their different pitches in their different rhythms . " And once , " declared Nea , recovering , " we were on a world called Kra , where , in a particularly depopulated area , they had just put a legal limit on how much material an architectural structure could employ ? " She looked about us at the sprawling levels of our ball court where so seldom , these days , anyone danced . Her hands , sheathed in foil and joined in her lap , tried to tug from their nest in her thighs . As she spoke , she leaned to the left ( tug ) , to the right ( tug , tug , tug . . . ) : they did not come loose , though I felt that the rooves themselves might peel from the sky if she overcame her own gravity . " There in the desert ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim of an overgrown crater , where we 'd heard the Family 'd been established . Sure enough , the flame-speakers around it were blaring , both in the High Musical code as well as the Low ( ironically pitched two octaves above the High one ) : Lest I forget thee , Oh Urth ! " They laughed ; they rocked . " And on a moon , once ? " I suppose Alsrod had some previous knowledge of the conversational path pursued by her sisters ; but frequently with the Thants , if not all folk in stressful situations , I get the impression they never say anything new . " Once ? " Alsrod 's hands were clasped on her knees . She swayed forward on the bench like a figure of struts and ropes , invisible thermofoils yanking at her shoulders as some undetectable hotwind whipped them back and forth , pulling her about as they whirled and snapped , collecting their  | nergetic bounty and directing her intense movements below . once , a moon , I passed a tiny office in a narrow corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all staffed by the local aliens ? " Fibermich , Nea , and George all turned to her reprovingly . " May the ant and the worm take dinner in my vitals , I speak the truth , " Alsrod protested . But one hand came loose from her knee and raised before her face as if to protect herself . " Go on , " my sister Lars said , perhaps as a representative of our own local aliens , and arched her lip bone . But I do n't think Alsrod saw it through her spread fingers . Her yes were closed . " ? staffed by local aliens , " she repeated in a voice respectfully devoid of emotion . " And on the wall , written clearly in incised letters ? " Here her hand returned to her knee which had jackknifed up to catch her bootheel on the bench 's inlaid edge ? " Fail not the eternal presence of Eurd . " Her eyes were still not open . They laughed . We smiled  --  which we assumed they would take as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things . They frequently did . " On Zetzor itself , in the south , there used to be a whole museum complex . Took up half the city of Q. Had folks handing out little cards on the cross-corners of cities all over our world , from 17 to 70 ; from A to R. Visit their paltry showing , and it stated in woman-high letters sunk into the piazza before the main rotunda : Forget not your debts and beginnings on Earth  --  and they meant , you know , the famous Earth , the sixth world so named after Old Earth itself ! " ( I 'd never heard of a particularly famous Earth , sixth named ; but I did n't interrupt gleaming George , who 'd stepped up to join the conversation . ) I " We had the complex shut down .

And their countless corrupt slogans . " The three seated howled wildly , swaying with the precision of three broad leaves of sarb-grass in a single breeze . A scowling brass giant , George watched attentively over their performance . " Now , of course , you ca n't set this against the problems of  | Nepiy .. . " I heard again from Thadeus . Indeed , hearing the name before , I 'd assumed it was just a trick of the ear . Even now it occurred to me that , with six thousand worlds to choose from , it was more likely that they were discussing some planet with a similar name than that they were discussing the actual world I 'd so recently visited . The evening drifted by . I drifted by people ; people drifted by me . Then Santine made her entrance , on a rag-rope platform that creaked , in ancient gilt fringe , down from the informal stars . She stuck out one of her tongues to receive me , and I thought she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize : " Do you really enjoy these affairs ? " I grinned , and-was about to say  --  but it was not Santine aping a human voice . It was Alsrod Thant , in her aluminum circles , who had just stepped up beside me . I said ( because frequently the truth provides the most diplomatic answer ) : " I do n't believe I 've ever attended one since I was your age where I did n't feel , beforehand , an oppressive dread at the isolation that can reign in a large enough group of even the most intimate friends , much less an admixture of intimates , acquaintances , and strangers . Still , so much of my social education has been effected in such gatherings , so many true friendships have had their beginnings in meetings much like yours and mine , that I feel these affairs must not only be endured , but negotiated with a certain energy , if not commitment . " I dropped my head a little to the side and gave her a grin . " They can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shaved scalp and high forehead , brown eyes blinked . The pupils were large enough to suggest either drugs or the slightest genetic divergence in human evolution . Suddenly she raised her hand , palm facing me . Before her face , brown fingers spread : " Oh ! The force of a criticism whose reasons I can no longer spelunk throws me into the neotenous posture of the tadpole , the caterpillar , the newt ! " I had never heard of any of these beasts , and neotenous I knew from nothing . I opened my eyes rather wide , but I guess I was still smiling .  | Alsrod dropped her nanu anu gnnncu t.u. . she pointed to my thigh . " What 's that hanging by your leg ? " " This ?

But she was from another world . .. . " This ? " I turned the leather binding over to the ground-glass screen ; on the back was a set of finger-tab switches , set within gemmed circles ? " is what they used to call a book . " It was a beautifully worked object , well read ( the leather around the controls was worn smooth ) , and no bigger than my palm . " My friend Santine here just returned it to me , earlier this afternoon . " Santine nodded , licked , and watched . Alsrod blinked at me some more , considering , I suppose , whether to go into another song , another dance . Finally , she said : " I know it 's a book . We have a whole library full at home . What 's it a book about ? Unless ? " Her large eyes lowered ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics my ignorance of your laws , land , and life would bar to any polite transgressions from a poor ? " " Oh , now , " I told her . " Of course it 's all right to ask ! " A library of books on Zetzor ? This one was an odd offworld object that had somehow gotten into a basement at Dyethshome . I 'd found it as a child just back from my first year offworld at Senthy . As far as I knew , it was the only book , at least of this particular technotype , on my world . " It 's a volume of Vondramach Okk . The poems , not the religious tracts . Apparently she used to joke that since nobody ever took the poetry of political rulers seriously , it did n't matter what language she wrote it in . So she used her own made-up one . This book contains all het privately published volumes of verse , a selection of her letters , her complete private journals , about six contrasting critical studies , and an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and documents that do n't get too political . " Alsrod stepped around me to see ; I touched a playback button . The screen became pink haze , above which formed the most frequently  | uvw vi VRR. sixty-seven stanuuru years mu , fall , olacK ? skinned , and gawky , she wore a maroon cape , blown back from u naked shoulder . Her breasts , emptied with age , hung against her ribs . Belt aslant sharp hips , she stood , in dark pants and darker boots , on a lime-pocked ledge , gazing pensively ( and poetically ) down on some absent landscape , one hand on her waist , one lost in the red folds of her cape , jaw , ear , one shoulder , and belt buckle rouged by a sun thrice the size of Quorja or Iiriani . " From what I 've studied of your local culture , however , in preparation for my coming ? " One hand holding her opposite elbow , Alsrod gazed at the twenty-five centimeter figure glowing above the book plate ? " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a sculpture  --  if you had n't told me , that is , it was a book . " That made me laugh . I hefted the object in my hand : the image above it stayed steadier than its projector lying in my palm . " I can see that . It does have a stage , I suppose . And half the statuary you see about today is some kind of image projection . But this is just one of the book 's illustrations . Besides , it 's not a technofact of our world  --  at least it 's not common to this area of it . " " And I never knew Okk wrote , " Alsrod added . " I mean poems . What an interesting-looking woman . And you must think so too . " She blinked rapidly at me . I nodded . " Most of the holograms we have of her come from the years she was in exile on Pretania . Like this . Once before , one story has it , she actually ordered all visual reproductions  --  of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of her , and she did n't like the slant of her nose or something . Or maybe she just felt she 'd become too recognizable . Another ruler would have dealt with the situation by having her own features altered  --  and she did that too , from time to time . But on Pretania , when it seemed , at least for a while , her political career was over , apparently she stopped caring who took pictures  --  and wrote her baker 's dozen greatest poems . " It 's easy to read , in that image , the aging poet pondering the coming stanza of one of her brooding , crepuscular cynghanedds . The biography , however , tells us that the fifteen planets she had finally annexed three years before had , through the successful revolt of the Regunyi , just dropped to twelve . She was much more likely contemplating the coming battle of Granger-9 where , in a six-month interstel- lai encounter , the Pretania exile would end and she wow ( ' sweep um , her grip live new worlds ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . 1 wondered what Alsrod saw in it . " Was she a major or minor writer ? " I smiled . " Personally , among poets , she 's my favorite . There 're a good number of study-groups devoted to her work , here and on many other worlds . But there are many thousands of poets neither of us will ever hear of with greater followings among people who , themselves , have never heard of her . In her youth , actually , she was quite stout . Only in her last decades , on Abnerangc , Pretania , and Tartouhm , did she develop that gaunt and austere appearance most of us associate with her today . " " She was an impressive-looking woman , " Santine said appreciatively , as I 've heard her say a dozen times in as many years . " I 've studied many major  --  and minor  --  poets on my world , " Alsrod announced ; she inclined her head to add : " What poems did she write ? ' ' With my middle finger I pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her most accessible lyrics  --  the third from that sumptuous second volume , Lyroks . Runes formed above the screen ; Vondramach faded . " One of the things that makes her particularly interesting is that the language she invented  --  actually she made it up when she was a girl on that large macro-life station where she spent a good part of her invalid childhood  --  employed both a phonetic and an ideographic writing system as well as a whole series of shiftrunes ? " " Shiftrunes ? " " Letters that are pronounced one way on their first occurrence in a text , another on their second , another on their third , and so on in a fixed sequence . It gives the poet an interesting technique to exploit : she can have pairs of words that alliterate visually but not phonetically as well as pairs that alliterate phonetically but not visually . And she can play the two off against each other . At any rate , most of Okk 's really interesting work is written in this language : the two epic-length pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of lyrics and love poems , Hermione at Buthrot . And of course both the early and late satires . If you like , I 'll give you the access code and you can take half a minute , learn the language from GI , then take a look at some of the poems in the original ? "  | " I 'm afraid that my impetuous youngest sister ? " Nea " Thant stepped up behind Alsrod . She placed her metal-covered hands not on Alsrod 's shoulders but centimeters above them ? " as this is her first trip to your world , has not been rendered compatible with your local General Information service ? " " I was going to get it done last week , " Alsrod said , " but I guess that was when Mickey and me were off on that ? " Then , assailed by astonishment , her hands raised to , but did not touch , her face . She rocked her head from side to side , intoning , while aluminum jangled : " Oh , repentance ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youth indulges among rocks and ice and icemoss ! " " Really , " I said , " it 's probably just as well . I mean , here at a party more than likely is n't the place you 'd want to go off in the corner to sit for half an hour with a ? " " But you are the host ! " declared Alsrod . Her arms jangled to her sides . " I want to submerge myself in your world , your life ! Your interests for the duration of my stay are mine ! Your theater , your sculpture ! Please tell me about your grandmother , Gylda Dyeth ! " With Nea behind her projecting her fixed smile above her head , Alsrod 's intensity fairly glittered . " I mean , she was a great friend of Vondramach 's was n't she ? Vondramach was the one who gave her all this ? " she swept her hands about , indicating all around ? " Dyethshome ? " Beyond us , the column glimmered . " Yes . " I smiled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear for me  --  we 'd been through this in one way or another with every Thant as we 'd met them , though it still surprised me , I suppose . " I 'll tell you , if you 'd like . " " Oh , please , yes . It 's your work anyway . You said you liked your work . " " I do . " The Thants have always been excited by the connection between Vondramach and Dyeth , the older just as much as the younger . Yet it still shocks me when that excitement erupts so blatantly . " What would you like to know ? " " How they met ? What did they do ? How did they part ? And then you must tell me about the stream which runs from them to you ! " I laughed , thinking how much I enjoyed the story , yet how much it always seemed that any time it 's told to the Thants , the tale was  | doomed to misunderstanding . Yet enjoyment won out . Au right . My seven-times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nineteen standard years old on a colony ship of eight thousand from a world called Klaven that I have never seen , but that a goodly number of the inhabitants at the time thought was on the verge of Cultural Fugue . " " But it was n't , " said Alsrod , who no doubt had already received one version or another of the tale from her siblings and parents , if not from her home world 's GI . " True . Eventually Klaven managed to get itself together again ? hut not before a number of its inhabitants had also managed to get themselves a new home , Gylda among them . She 'd probably been some kind of free-agented professional- before she came here , though we do n't have much information about that period of her life . On Velm , she lived a while in the north , did n't like it , moved to the south , and did . At one point , however , she was up on our smaller moon , Arvin ? " " Ah , " Alsrod sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attenuated moons , where night and gravity are stretched nearly to the breaking . " It had so much the sound of a quote from some poet I 'd ought to have read , I did n't even bother to ask GI to identify the allusion . " Moons , " Alsrod repeated . " We do n't have any moons around Zetzor . It 's a great sadness to me . " " Well , we have two , " I said . " Moons are smaller than worlds . People stay closer together on moons . Vondramach Okk and her entourage were en route from one star to another , when she stopped at Arwin 's relay station . In spite of her security , she and Gylda met . The middle-aged tyrant was much impressed with the young woman colonist and hired her right there . Gylda worked for Vondramach over the next half-dozen years , traveling with her and without her about the galaxy , with a freedom that , from all reports , was rather like yours with your government 's gift of unlimited space-fare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vondramach gave her Dyethshome ! " Alsrod supplied , looking about the high-ceilinged court . " As a reward for her faithfulness ! " " I 've always suspected it was a bit more complicated than that . " I looked about my home . " Vondramach was one of the great proponents of the Family . Gylda was an adherent of the Sygn  --  as was  | most of Velm at the time . It probably would n't have made that much difference to them , as both of them were personally very tolerant , but one of Gylda 's major reasons for retiring was that she wanted to raise children for a while . Sometime before she left Klaven , she 'd suffered several massive radiation contacts . She had so many smashed and shattered chromosomes only a complex enzyme therapy kept her from blooming into rampant malignancies three or four times a week . She 'd been sterilized when very young  --  probably under unpleasant conditions . Because of that old radiation bout , she could n't be cloned . But Gylda had a kind of single-mindedness  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had all of Dyethshome to let kids run around in ; and believe me , that 's some running . When she came back to Morgre and moved in here , she adopted two human females , Lane and Neza , and a human male , Vrach , from the north of our world . They 'd been orphaned in the early conflicts between the native evelm and human colonists . She brought them up , here at Dyethshome , while she collected the art works and cultural artifacts that gave this place its purpose in the culture of Morgre . Over the next fifteen years , Gylda and her three children survived all seven visits Vondramach paid her  --  I mention it because not everyone did . When Vondramach came to visit , she brought not only her entourage but her whole lifestyle , which included assassination attempts , strategic murders , political intrigues and factional hugger-mugger of precisely the sort Gylda had left her services to get away from . On Vondramach 's sixth visit the killing of Secretary Argenia occurred right there in Dyethshome 's north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today we hardly ever use it  --  I 'm sure the custom goes back to the Argenia assassination . Visiting students are the only ones who ever go in there now . There was never any doubt in Gylda 's mind that Vondramach herself was responsible for the murder . On her seventh visit , Gylda suggested that Vondromach not come back . This time there was quite an argument . But the tyrant refrained from bombing Dyethshome , blowing up Morgre , and blighting the land for a hundred kilometers in all directions  --  all things she was quite capable of doing when she got riled . But she never returned . Five years later she was overthrown . Three years after that , she was dead . And Gylda went on with her life here . The only one of Gy1da 's children interested in raising more children was the male , Vrach.  | Vrach Dyeth and her lover , another human male , Orgik Korm , took over Dyethshome . They had two male children cloned from the germ-plasm of a friend of theirs on store in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , who had been killed some years before in a local mountain slide up in the Myaluths . These clone-twins , Cyar and Hashe , began the third wave of Dyeths to live here at Dyethshome . Vrach and Orgik later adopted a human female also from the north , named Jekk , which completed that wave 's ripple . There 's some unpleasantness connected with Hashe , the details of which I do n't really know . She went off and did something nobody approved of , but what it was I 'm not sure . Jekk and Cyar decided , when they were in their late fifties , they wanted to carry on with Dyeths for another ripple . Both of them had jobs1 as evelmian ethnologists . They worked with an ethnological commune that was then helping the native evelmi who were fleeing from the north  --  human/evelm relations have always been strained up there . Dyethshome was given over to their ethnological commune , so that the place became a laboratory as well as a museum in those years , and all the humans and evelmi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Gubba , Rhis , and Wee are some of the names of those adults . And their children ? all adopted and all native evelmi , included Kee'fa , Jatch'jat , another Vrach , Large Maxa , Ari , and Liji . . . . Gylda lived a dozen years into this fourth nonhuman ripple of the Dyeth stream . She was very pleased about it , too . People often wonder why evelm/human relations have been so much better in the south . Myself , I think it 's because both populations are smaller here  --  and we always have the north 's appalling example to instruct us . Ari was the first of that ripple to decide on more children , and she brought in as a child one of my own grandmothers , Genya , who , as an adult , joined with Large Maxa from the generation before , who 's also parenting for this generation as well  --  but you know , evelmi mature more slowly than humans and live longer . So actually numbering ripples beyond this point gets confusing . The point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ripple of parents and any ripple of children at Dyethshome ? nor have there ever been , since Gylda began the stream , seven ripples ago . " " But when there are so many paths and parameters , " Alsrod declared , or rather , as I recognized a few words into it , quoted ,  | " along which and around which women young , old , human , evelm , male , female , and neuter  --  can develop both community and communion to be passed on to others , why should you restrict yourselves to direct egg-and-sperm relations ? That 's wonderful ! " " Well , " I said . " It may not be all that wonderful , but it 's the way our particular nurture stream worked out . More than half the streams here in Morgre have used direct genetic reproduction in some form or another at least once a ripple , since their founding . Perhaps in Gylda 's time there was active resentment against it as a method . It smacked too much of Family Life , which had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . Egg-and-sperm relations between stream ripples ? Myself , I like to think of it as a method we just have n't gotten around to yet . " " And now you must tell her why you call it a stream  --  instead of a family with a small Fibermich said , stepping up beside her sister , with great approval beaming in her face . " Well , I ? " Fibermich immediately darted away again . " Oh , please , " said Alsrod , while I looked after her . " I want you to say it ! " I laughed again . " If you 're really interested . But I know you know it already . All right . Velm is a very dry world . Water is rare here . The propagation of nurture has always been highly respected among the evelm . But none of their local languages ever developed a general term for reproductive lines . Stream ' was the term they used for their educational paths , their universities , which extend all over the planet . When the human and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriation of the educational sign to the nurturing situation was one result . " " And now , " declared Nea , peering at me over her young sister 's shoulder , " you must tell her the conceptual ways in which a stream differs from a family . " " Perhaps we should leave that till . . . " Even someone who likes to talk as much as I do and works2 at it eventually feels a sense of occasional strain when running on too much . " I mean , I 'm sure Alsrod already knows it , so that ? " " But I must hear it in your own voice , " Alsrod exclaimed . " It 's what I have come light years for ! "  | " All right , " I said once more . " But there 're so many ways that a stream differs from a family , I do n't know where to start . The father-mother-son that makes up the basic family unit , at least as the Family has described it for centuries now , represents a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subordinate powers , as well as paths for power developments and power restrictions . lt 's also a conceptual structure as well , a model through which to see many different situations . The Family has always been quite loose in applying that system to any given group of humans or nonhumans , breeding or just living together , so that you can have lots of fathers , lots of mothers , lots of sons ; and any woman of any age or any gender can always fill any of the roles ; I 'm sure the right Family analyst could reinterpret our nurture stream or your reproductive commune as a classical family ' without an eyeblink , just by assigning one or more parts to one or more women . But if we agreed to the model , no doubt we 'd begin to stabilize the power structure it controls . But there 're other power structures that can apply to nurturing groups . For instance , in the Family structure , the parents are seen to contain and enclose the children , to protect them from society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection between the parents and the society . To become a parent is to immediately have your child change your relation to society . Suddenly you have to deal with nurseries , nutrition co-ops , study-groups  --  a whole raft of social institutions . Because most children do n't generate from within streams , the stream structure conceives of all children as gifts from society , as I gifts to society . In the stream structure ? " " Now translate ! " Alsrod suddenly cried . " Excuse me ? " " I know that Dyethshome used to be the scene of marvelous theatrical productions for all of Morgre  --  all of M-81 . And I have come here to see one  --  metaphorically speaking , of course . And you are so generously providing it ! No , I have not read Okk 's verse , but I 've studied the works of one of your greatest playwrights and musicians , Jae'l Bazerat , whose finest productions were performed here in the amphitheater at Dyethshome . She wrote of the streams that ran across the deserts and swamps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans left their pawprints here . "  | " That 's true , " I said . " Among academic playwrights she 's considered ? " " Yet Vondramach is your poet , Marq Dyeth ! " Alsrod beamed once more , as though some extremely important point had been made . " Now translate for me . " She pointed to the book I still held but which , in the course of my disquisition , I 'd forgotten . " You mean this . . . poem ? " The runes of the long-dead tyrant , whose childhood friends had called her Dramach and whose adult intimates had addressed her as Vondra ( a word which , in her own language , meant " the taloned claw " ) , hung in the air above the stage my hand made . I wondered whether Alsrod 's abrupt change of subject was an expression of boredom , a social custom , a logic alien to me , or simply personal avidity . " Well . . . this one is from her series of participatory poems . She added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Strange ' . . . or maybe better , ' The Awkward . ' But the word can also mean ' The Exotic , ' or simply ' Another Person ' ? or also , ' Another System . ' " ( Somewhere in her journals , Okk writes : Poetry is what is avoided as it is surrounded by translation . In her own language , however , it only takes three words , all beginning with the same sound , ' ch . ' ) " Anyway , she provides one half-line and a single letter that you have to work into a word in your own version of a second half-line . . . . " But how could anyone who did n't know Vondramach Okk 's private tongue appreciate the participatory works ? Beneath the book I fingered the random selector : runes flickered till I released the touch-tab . " Now this one . . . yes , happens to be another of my favorites . The title means ' The President , ' or maybe ' The Ruler , ' though it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or presiding . The particular root word  --  which she also invented  --  means ' stroking softly ' or , in some cases , ' mangling . ' " " Is it autobiographical ? " Alsrod asked . I was surprised . " Many commentators have taken it to be  --  though she wrote a much earlier draft of it when she was still a child at the hospital station at Jryla . But really , Alsrod , perhaps the next time you come you 'll be wired for local GI compatibility and we can . . . " Nea still stood with her hand poised above her sister 's shoulders . I saw Fibermich off and joking uproariously with a bunch of parents , for all the world as though she were barring them from our conversation .  | Then I turned and saw what , in the corner of my eye , had given that impression : her metallic figure chased at forearms , temples , and calves with high veins , George Thant stood up on the bench by the spillway , arms folded , legs apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santine , Alsrod , and me . George frowned intently . At any inter-geosector party people always do strange things and other people try to remain oblivious . At a party for folk of different worlds , both the strangeness and the obliviousness can reach surreal proportions . People milled about George 's knees , occasionally tossed a quip up at her , occasionally did n't , and drifted on . " I would like to be a ruler , a president , or a mangler ! " Alsrod announced beneath her sister 's smile . " And I would like to be a poet . " I laughed . " But I 'm too far along in my life to start another profession , ; and fortunately there are laws and institutions today to prevent rulers from becoming manglers , at least on Vondramach 's scale . " " Were n't there laws and institutions two hundred years ago ? " Alsrod asked . Santine chimed in with one of her tongues in one of her more cajoling voices : " When one actually starts the historical research , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never been to another world , except once in a vaurine tour . Most likely , I 'll never go in vivo . Would you tell me : how do you find the flavor of the experience hangs in your mouth , my young wanderer ? " " Well , with all this talk of poetry , it 's a shame to bring up a cliche , but a vaurine tour is more educational  --  and fun . And I suppose . . . " ( While Alsrod searched for the proper metaphor , I beamed all astral thanks to my old labor2-mate for letting me out of the frying pan . ) " Well , a vaurine tour simply serves up richer , better prepared , and more carefully orchestrated flavors than live chance possibly could .... " Without looking , I fingered another button on the book 's bottom to turn it off , and let the chain slide down through my fingers . Alsrod stepped out from under the foil epaulets Nea 's hands had become , to continue her conversation with Santine . ( The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still smiled , and still kept up her hands , as though preserving a cave into which her sister might retreat should she accidentally and irreparably disgrace herself .  | An image : Fibermich and George , now that Alsrod had turned from me , coming together to join Nea in a toe-to-toe line for a precise and ordered bow . ( Behind Nea I could see a stone cyhnk that had been brought here from the Arvin to decorate the room how many decades ago now : Nea 's arms , in their fixed position , looked like two more of the religious symbol 's branches transferred from the living trunk . ) But before I could find out if my vision was simply fantasy or social prediction , laughter exploded across the room . Thadeus Thant came toward us , followed by my sisters Bucephalus and Tinjo and my other sister , white-skinned and livid-eyed Maxa . A swarm of three-centimeter metallic disks careened in a suspensor field maybe a decimeter away from Thadeus 's body . Blue , gold , copper , silver , and black metal whizzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convocation of comets . Between , now and again , you could see within , up here an aged eyelid , down there a parchment kneecap , higher a collapsed pectoral with its folded dug . " What are you youngsters plotting over here ? How are you planning to do in your parents this time ? " We all laughed now . " We 're plotting to steal time itself from you , " declared Fibermich . " We 're going to spike it to the floor as it slips by . And just as you come over to see why it 's so still , we 'll pull it out from under you ? " " ? and send you spinning off around the galaxy 's edge , " my sister Alyxander took it up , " on your grandest adventure yet , Thad ! " " We 're planning to pluck all the best stars out of the sky and stuff them in our pockets , " I said , " so that when we meet you once again and thrust our hands deep inside to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were desert grains , caught down in the seams , and we 'll smile at you on your way to a glory that , for all our stellar thefts , we shall never be able to duplicate . " " Respect ! " Thadeus said loudly , in that great , brassy voice  --  though the corporeal Thadeus always seemed so little inside the colorful cloud . " Yes , that 's respect ! " I believe this eldest of the three Thant mothers was honestly happy young Dyeths had taken time to learn at least some of the rituals from the polar geosector on a far , far world . " Now why do n't you ? " Thadeus waved an arm toward us seated children , though I only glimpsed a wrinkled elbow , a vein curving a  | wrist . Bright metal swooped and careened ? " you show the kind of respect these youngsters do , " and comets flew on across the pulsing colors on the pastel floor to join more of our parents . All of us looked at each other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all  --  Thant children and Dyeth children  --  in one way or another loved the old creature whom , because of the privacy disks always in flight about her , we saw so little of . As such encounters do , this one dissolved our conversational group , and the fragments moved to reconstellate . I heard Santine say , as she moved off with Thad : " But you were talking about Nepiy ? Young Marq mentioned it to me not so long ago .... " Curiosity would have moved me off after them . But there was a motion by my eyes  --  then shadow . I stopped , surprised . Alsrod had stuck her hand before my face and shook it . I blinked ? but it was just a way of getting my attention . " That , " she said , dropping her hand once she was sure she 'd got it , " is a cyhnk , is n't it ? " She nodded toward the carved stone medusoid , which , moments ago , her sister had stood before . " What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now you know a cyhnk is the sign of the Sygn , " said Fibermich , stepping up to rejoin us in her lace of small chains , clearly deprecating her younger sister 's disingenuousness : but she flashed a huge and toothy smile in case I did n't know she was part of it . " The Sygn is the veritable and virtual enemy of the Family on all , or almost all , worlds among the six thousand , " concluded Nea , strolling up on the other side . As she moved in her armor of foil , studs , and leathers , a sly look suffused her dark , full mouth , to let us know she knew we knew she knew . " No , I mean , " Alsrod insisted , " this cyhnk here . I know they all mean something different . " " It 's an old piece , " I explained , " dating from about two and half centuries ago . It comes from a local monastery , the Arvin , at the south of Morgre . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestal it was grotesquely handsome : a four-foot stone trunk that branched into seven writhing arms , each ending in a gross red gem . " At the Arvin , they used to teach that the cyhnk symbolized the difference between its own , unified trunk and its many-branching  | head , a sign of the difference between the one and the many . Myself , I was always quite sure it was a stylized presentation of one of the tolgoth cactuses growing on the other side of the Hyte : but even our local retreat stressed that the image did n't come from our world or any world near it  --  though that was rather hard to believe with a forest of the things only a kilometer and a half away . . . at least that 's what it seemed like when I was eight or nine or ten . " " When did you learn , " Alsrod asked , " that the meaning of the cyhnk was not the same everywhere in the universe ? " " Only about ten years ago , actually , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't recall , I came across an older Sygn retreat . Right behind them some looming temporary factory had just gone up that for twenty months would be hot-stamping out large , ceramic , ugly things so that the murals I had come to see in my free three hours before my ship took off  --  they dated from the time the building had been an exploratory outpost five centuries before  --  were gummed over with black , protective elastic to absorb the shock and keep them from cracking . Anyway , once I doffed my airmask inside the irregular and blobbed transparent walls , distorting the starscape and rockscape outside , somehow a priestess got to explaining that the shape of the cyhnk I was familiar with back here on Velm was only one of many a cyhnk could have . On some worlds , apparently , it 's a trunk with just two branches , both quite straight . On others  --  the one I was on for instance  --  it had five branches , each of which was a regular helix . And on some  --  though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a cluster of a hundred and eleven twisting spokes ; then , on others , it 's only a single bar with a jewel at each end ; and on still others , it 's a jeweled sphere  --  while on still others , it 's a plain one . These wise women in their deep robes and the grilled mouth-speakers they wore to disguise the individuality of their voices told me that on many worlds the cyhnk signifies , as it does on Velm , a difference between one part of itself and another . But on other worlds  --  for instance , theirs  --  it signified the difference between one cyhnk and another , the difference between the myriad kinds of cyhnks that exist on myriad worlds , the difference between the myriad dogmas , each one different for each different part of each different world , that make up the institution so frequently known as the Sygn . " They all laughed again , this time , oddly , all on one pitch . One  | after another and each at a different speed , they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George  --  who had come up to join us somewhere in the midst of my recitation . And though I now requested explanation from the sociological GI program I always keep on tap with visitors from different cultures ( as they no doubt keep one on me ) , I could not learn the significance of that alien motion . From the metal cloud that was Thadeus , once more her brassy voice boomed : " Respect for the old and appreciation of the new , that 's what the name of Thant is all about ! And that 's what I found on Nepiy , too  --  that 's what made it such a wonderful world ! Oh , if you 'd ever been there , you 'd remember Nepiy : chalk-white deserts under an onyx black sky , stretching to the horizon in all directions , with orderly crevices dug into them , where women live in harmony and goodwill in the dwellings cut into the stone  --  oh , no ! Not like the zigzag canyons of Zetzor , but rational , orderly , precise . The gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchant whoever appreciates the fine heights that human civilization can reach . A fine world , a wonderful world  --  I had a wonderful time there ! Someday you must visit it . Oh , yes ! You must ! " Thadeus laughed again , hugely and generously , while Eulalia , through the array of my own parents and siblings , trailing her clouds of metals , gems , and lights , moved around and around her co-spouse , miming gestures that , in our own world 's theatrical tradition , at any rate , indicated here obeisance , now mockery , there despair ; or joy . And I could not help thinking that , although Thadeus and I may have been on the same planet , because , no doubt , we had been on it months and geosectors apart , we had really been to different worlds . The evening drifted on . When , for the tenth time , my eyes had gone ceilingwards  --  not to examine constellations but to imagine the real stars far above their argent representations  --  I finally decided I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from the spillway upstairs , I waited out the end of a story from ( of course ) Clearwater Thant , and ( it was a rather good one ) , laughing , excused myself . Dark hands came up , but not to halt me so much as to push me on my way . And Clearwater 's own light laughter followed me as I threaded from the thrumming falls . But I 'd taken as much as I could of strangely behaved , too easily impressed , boisterous , familiar friends . I went to my room .  | Way down and away from anywhere else , it had once belonged to a Dyeth mother , Ari , two ripples before . I 'd been ten and had just returned from that first extended visit offworld to the giant moon , Senthy : Egri had taken me there to stay with my grandmother Genya for nearly a standard year , and my memory still swarmed with images of those tall women , their fur parkas drawn tightly around their pitted faces as they poled their boats in toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly exotic by a simple trip of twenty-six light-years home , my mother Maxa inserted the hard fact : I was of an age to choose up a local habitation and a name . The last was easy . With a bunch of my parents , I went down to the record union in Morgre 's lowest level , the knots in the polished pith walls recalling faces on another world , and registered the " Marq " which people had been calling me all my life . The habitation , however , took some trips over and around the area to search out a proper spot  --  I wanted something rural , with natural rock , water , and all the technological comforts a rather spoiled twelve-year-old could imagine . My temp-parent , Kelso , was with us ; and after several hundred k 's cruising about , she suddenly declared : " Look . I know what Marq wants ! Do you remember Ari 's old place ? Whatever happened to ... " Back home , there was the scrabble through the closet full of discarded domestic cassettes ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love the location more or the fact that it 's been a living room for Dyeths as long as it has : Twenty-foot fire cactuses rose behind the ornate rail at the polished planks ' oest end . ( Shells and rocks , rocks and shells . ) Overhead , a few night clouds pulled away from the brilliant oversized star that is our larger moon . The rocks beyond the rail were tufted with giltgorse . An orange carpet on the dark wood gave under my bare feet as I walked from the fading entrance column . Beyond the platform , through the tolgoth growth , the stream plashed . How many times a week do I open the railing gate , take some text-crystal from the fiche-board standing below my bed ( six carved legs , with strange ball-claws for feet , rumpled sleeping mat over it ) , along with a portable reader  | ( what we have instead of clumsy , beautiful hooks ) , to go and sit , to sit and dream , my hack against some velvet-harked elephant lichen , to dream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills that gentled the horizons to the north , the crazy jewelry of Morgre-complex 's upper park levels  --  my night light all through those strange years when childhood gives way to the beginning of adulthood  --  glittered like a little cyhnk ; I was as far away from the city now as Santine 's room , but in another direction . In the platform 's center stood a round desk  --  old , locally crafted , a horror to look at , but ridiculously efficient . Its reddish top was cluttered with gaming pieces , editing blocks , lengths of tape , and the reassembled skeleton of a small creature resembling a desert skate but indigenous to one or the other of Velm 's polar wastes . Suspended above it all glowed a globe that , besides serving as a lamp , was also the central star in a double-sunned orrery  --  no , not Iiriani/Iirianiprime  --  of ten planets ( thirty moons among them , one of which was , yes , giant and nostalgic Senthy , circling its huge , useless world , NRJ-6B ) , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the desk , the comscreen was still up out of its slot , a pile of dice in front of it ; a piece of string on which I 'd been practicing whed-knots ( an art performed by a small northern tribe of Velm natives with their hind feet ; and I was improving ) lay across it . Scattered before it were some text crystals from my seven-times-great grandmother 's unreadable memoirs which , that morning , I 'd once again taken from the Old Library . As I approached the desk , the bench rolled out from under it ; the bench-back swung up and took the proper curve and angle . On the comscreen , which for some reason had n't turned off when I 'd left , the pale colors of the ball court still pulsed : within the pentagonal frame , among the laughter , I watched Thadeus Thant ( voice like a cracked claxon , a gentle , jovial , jealous creature , who , now at age eighty , has learned to turn jealousy into ambition ) , Clearwater Thant ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most prolific , in years the oldest , but looks not a day over fifty , my favorite , and by me the one with the dryest sense of humor ) and imperious Eulalia Thant ( an impressive redhead surrounded by more jewelry than I think all of us Dyeths owned , kilos of it floating out on suspensors  | that kept it turning slowly about her , as she turned about her children , her spouses , a woman with an insight into human motivations both cultivated and uncanny ) , and Fibermich , Nea , George , Alsrod . . . all bobbing about among human and inhuman Dyeths and friends of Dyeth . I sat . I watched . I pondered the performance below long enough to sense what an odd feeling familiarity is , consisting as much of the dark things that attract as it does of the bright ones that repel . Was it simply all that warmth and those good wishes ? Sitting there , I felt it swinging at my side , and ran my hand down the chain to retrieve it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Runes swarmed as I lifted it , giant gnats swinging about it as the book swung . ( But I thought I 'd turned it off . . . ) Apparently in my haste I 'd just flipped the random selector to still another poem . It had been on all this time . On my cluttered desk top I set the book that could have been stage or sculptor 's pedestal . Above it hung dark runes that could have been a statue or a performance . Between them I watched the comscreen , bright with the party . Before I tell you which poem was on , I want to tell you something that the title ( in lower case runes at the very bottom ) brought immediately to my mind . An evelm philosopher once wrote : " Almost all human attempts to deal with the concept of death fall into two categories . The first can be described by the injunction : Live life moment by moment as intensely as possible , even to the moment of one 's dying . ' The second can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly eternal  --  time , space , or whatever hypermedium they are inscribed in  --  and ignore all the illusory trivialities presented by the accident of the senses , unto birth and death itself . ' For women who adhere to either position , " this wise creature noted , " the other is considered the pit of error , the road to injustice , and the locus of sin . " At this point , I must explain that by " human attempts to deal with the concept of death , " the evelm philosopher in question meant only those humans who happened to have lived in this world , Velm , up in the beleaguered north or here in the calmer south , for the last three hundred and eighty years . This philosopher was no doubt unconcerned with that greater death , Cultural Fugue , and if  | . omeone ever told her that the first attitude more or less categorizes the Sygn and that the second is indicative of Family , I suspect that this venerable sage would have returned a look to remind any human that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course : the perfect translation for the title of Vondramach Okk 's early participatory poem , even though the connotations differ : " The Alien . " Why had n't I been able to think of it with Alsrod ? ) The title of the poem I had accidentally opened to translated clearly and simply : " Stranger . " I did n't read it . Fingering my scrotum , I felt my penis move on the back of my hand , till some unspecified desire began to weight and lift my genitals with blood . I waited for that desire to fix on some current masturbatory image . When it did n't , I briefly thought I might leave my room , my home , and seek one of the city 's runs . But apparently whatever I was feeling could not express itself through public copulation any more than through private satisfaction . Desire died . What replaced it was a GI access code . Had I really been thinking about it during the intervening time ? I turned off the book and pushed it aside . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclassifications contingent on inquiries after Rhyonon . But there was another operative in the tale that could be inquired after . Why did I think about it now ? Perhaps it was simply because I was feeling I should n't be feeling so at home . I thought : Non-human life forms , and my mind filled with another lengthy access code of numbers and colors . I read them over to myself . They cleared away , and I thought From the bottom of some distant GI storage bank  --  rank upon rank of the tiniest , brightest metalloids submerged in some super-chilled , coal-black , linearly conductive syrup  --  the information welled into my mind like memory : Among the many forms of life discovered in human world-hopping , a surprising number of them clearly intelligent ,  | many of them culturally advanced , and even a handful with extraordinarily ingenious methods for getting between the planets and moons of their own sun systems , the Xlv are the single species besides humans who have an efficient means of interstellar travel . For many years their starships were mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteoric rubble , here and there a huge multifaceted crystal face glittering  --  through which nothing is visible . Inhabitants of at least two hundred gas giants throughout the galaxy , the Xlv still can not be designated a race with whom we have " established communications . " Our ignorance of them is oppressive . Do they have a languages ? Can the term intelligence be applied to them ? Do they know of our existence ? There is still a raging debate on whether they construct their ships as humans do , or whether they secrete them in some way similar to the way certain insects secrete the waxy material for their nests ... . As I reviewed their tripartite plasmoid biology , learned of their odd colonies that may or may not be floating well down in the atmosphere of gaseous planets almost large enough to ignite into small stars , reviewed the rare space encounters between human and X1v  --  so baffling as to leave moot in almost every case whether an encounter had or had not occurred  --  I recalled Okk 's absent half-lines in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a complete question mark , nor are we even sure which direction that question mark faces . ( They are a shiftrune whose sound sequence remains unuttered . ) When our instruments detect Xlv on one world , how are we to know their social or political relations to the Xlv on another ( Do they have societies ? Cultures ? Politics ? ) ; not to mention the relation of Xlv on one ship to the Xlv on another . ( In the conflict between Sygn and Family , if one does something appalling to a neutral party  --  as has more than once been the case  --  the other certainly does n't want to take the blame . ) What kinds of governments do they have ? Which kinds get along ? Which kinds are constantly falling into tension situations ? Is interstellar travel for them analogous to the human discovery of the potter 's wheel , paternity , the solar system , or the semiconductor ? Among **29;112;TOOLONG worlds and thousands of billions of humans and aliens , there are probably hundreds of thousands , even millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scattered  | ross any hundred or five hundred worlds . That is still a microscopic rcentage of humanity as a whole . If only because there is so much to know in our human universe , the working assumption you can go on is : You may assume , about absolutely any fact ( how many transuranic elements are there ? why does cold water remove human blood stains faster than hot ? ) that nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a thousand do not know t  --  which goes for the working assumption too . And the Xlv , who , after all , are alien , touch an even more microscopic percentage of human lives than most things . Thus : " There is an alien life form that travels between stars " is simply another little-known fact  --  because in our human universe , of necessity , all facts are as little known as the works of great poets . The green light bar before the comscreen on my desk was blinking under the tape rumple and through the dice . Some sister or parent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to , jovially to demand I return to the ball court and watch the presentation of some elaborate gift , hear the recitation of some florid toast . Beyond the rail , fire cactus tittered . The warm breeze tickled my neck . Among cold stars a single light moved in a trajectory between moons  --  a satellite catching and throwing back a fragment of my world 's communicative complexities . What would the Xlv mean to the Thants of Zetzor , the Dyeths of Velm , to the women , human or other , of ( approx. ) six thousand two hundred worlds ? What about the fact : There is an alien lifeform that may have destroyed someone 's world . . . ? What did that mean to the Xlv ? The call bar blinked green again . I started to press it , but for a moment I looked over the railing about the patch of mine that filled my after-dark horizons ; and felt strange  --  estranged , really , as though considering the demise of one world made me a stranger to this most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshes , the urban complexes and universities and hive-caves of Velm , I wondered , flare suddenly and broil away before a world-wide fire wall . . . ? With that smile we prepare so easily for friends , for stream , for anyone we love ( and which always feels so odd in the ligaments of  | the human face ; though the evelmi among the Dyeths say they do not know this feeling ) , I pressed the answer plate . " Hey , Clearwater ... " I said to the familiar face forming . " Look , would you tell V'vish and Shoshona I 'll be back up in a while ? Do n't worry , I have n't finked out on you yet . " At the same time the column of light that was the entrance to my room came on in the platform corner . I glanced at it as George Thant materialized , with that artificially metallized skin , looking very like a polished bronze statue , every one of her movements suggesting pyrite heated to that near-white temperature where the form begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was laughing and rocking . But since she was outside ( more properly , inside ) the door ( more properly , the column ) and my viewing light had , finally , been fixed , I could see her ; but she could n't see me . On the comscreen Clearwater was saying : " . . . and come downstairs , Marq , before George gets there and makes a nuisance of herself . " George is probably the strongest person I 've known from any world , physically speaking , who does not use artificial muscular additors . " Marq ! Hey , Marq ! " She was flexing her brazen hands as though one or the other of them might be clutching a rock , a neck , an ice shard . " Come on and join the party . We want to see you ! " " All right , George , " I said . " I 'll be down in a few minutes ! " " Look , only one of your beautiful sisters is still around . Egri is doing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows how to make strangers here feel at home . Come on down and be hospitable ! " " George , " I said , this time loud enough for her to hear , " you would be at home in the pit of a volcano or on top of a glacier " ? both of which are structures common on Zetzor and unknown on Velm . " Look , hang on to your left tit and I 'll be up when I damned well feel like it , you metallurgist 's reject ! " It fascinates me what makes some people comfortable . George roared with laughter and turned in the column unsteadily , like someone a great deal drunker than I suspect she was . " Now stop cluttering my doorsill , gnat-brain , and leave me alone ! " And we do have gnats here . And I do n't like them . There 's an energy about the Thants , every one of them , that fascinates us Dyeths- almost every one of us . We regard it , watch it , discuss it endlessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our age and tradition . George is also the least sexually exciting human I can think of , which has always struck me as odd since strength and size are usually positive factors in my erotic schema . But in her great body , they just sat together wrong . I suspect the Thants surround for me all that is , or could possibly be , alien . ( " The alien is always constructed of the familiar , " is as good a translation as any of " The Alien " ' s opening half-line , though it lacks all music . ) And I know that 's because any request for a false parity , where Dyeths might play a congruent part in the Thants ' schema , is simply not to be met with . Still , the fascination  --  much more than the simple desire to use ? exists on both sides ; probably exists less on their side than on ours , which is the wonder . " Yes , Clearwater . I wo n't let George bother me . I hear you . Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance column went dark in the corner around retreating bronze . On the comscreen Clearwater 's black face melted , glittering , like all night .  | Cut through the galaxy 's glitter ; slice away all night . What thoughts did I dole out to that world ( out of the six thousand , which , according to a rumor that had crept worlds and worlds away , corroborated only by a certain certified psychotic , may have been ) destroyed by XIv ? Certainly I thought about it . Yet after a week , after a handful of weeks , now at home , now away , somehow the rational part of my mind had accorded it much the weight one gives to the most insubstantial notion . I was finishing up a fairly simple job , ? though today , none are easy . The folk artists in the temperate wastes of Yinysh  --  a world whose polar caps are sheeted with black ice  --  make vast mosaics out of tiny laterally sensitive tiles : changes in light cause them to change not their own color , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : by fine maneuverings , this can be worked into a mosaic whose picture moves and changes with the changing sun . Four thousand seven hundred light-years along the rim , an architect in the equatorial stone fields of Batria  --  a thin-aired planet where atmosphere is released from volcanic fissures in the north and shipped in orange plastic tanks to the planetary midlands  --  heard of them . As she was  | also a religious leader for three geosectors , nothing would do nut to import the actual tiles to decorate her new pantheon 's sunrise-facing facade . The expense was undertaken in the name of interworld relations . I was hired for expenses ( huge ) and a modest fee ( modest ) to shepherd those cartons of glittering hexagons across five thousand light-years of dark . We had paused on some vasty station orbiting one of Batria 's Lagrange points . I was off ship in a library cubicle looking up information that I thought might come in handy for a jobs that I saw a good chance of picking up once I got down to Batria ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your unmoral , tasteless , obscene . . . Anyway , there 's one reason they need industrial diplomats ) , when my call number slid up the green tube running past my cubicle , stopped at eye level , and bonged . I swung the reader away from my nose and turned . The call , when I thought through my reception code ( visualize yellow fading slowly to green , while hearing the first three digits of my home-mail routing number recited in my sister Alyxander 's voice , followed by the sudden stench of burnt plastic ) ran round the tube in imperative pink : Report instanter to the Web Official at Level Two ( that 's quarter gravity ) , coordinates 12-17 . Curious as to what could possibly be questioned this time about my cargo , I hauled myself out of the cubicle and kicked off through the enamel and silver hall ( the library was in the free fall level ) , from time to time giving myself another pull on the wall railing . Accelerate in freefall , and you always have the vaguest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the equally vague feeling you 're falling straight down . I fell ( straight down ) at a lift cable , grabbed it , and lifted ( straight up and at right angles to my former down ) through the side wall . Moments later , I stepped off with the blobby feeling one gets in quarter-normal , and strode unsteadily forward , taking giant steps , over the yellow pebbled flooring and under blue hanging gewgaws , with large-leafed plants waving either side . 12-17 was a forest of reflecting panels . I stepped among them , worked my way around layer after layer ; the floor itself became flats of glass over lower flats of mirror . My own reflection reduplicated away from me in myriad directions , heads all turning as I turned , feet all stepping as I stepped . And suddenly I was surrounded by , and  | confronted with , and interwoven among a woman who looked up at me from her desk and said : " Marq Dyeth . " She smiled with the face of a friendly mule . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The new blue , green , and red rays around the sunburst on her shoulder told me she 'd moved up some in the Web 's hierarchy since we 'd last chatted together behind the protective plastic shields on the flame beaches of Shahng-al-Voyard . " Honestly , " I said , " you are not whom I expected to see here . " " I 'm not here , actually . " She turned in her seat , pushed the desk , which drifted aside on silent rails , and crossed her silver leggings . I sat on the floppy purple thing inflating blobbily behind me . " Just how far away are you ? " It firmed beneath me . " More than nine thousand light-years . " She toyed with something that was gold and thin , black nobs on both ends . ( Pencil ? Microphone ' ? Letter opener ? ) " That 's a rather costly hyperwave projection just to say hello . " " We have forty minutes conference time , Marq . A few seconds out for nostalgia wo n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll let it go at that . " I had some good memories of Japril : her insight , her ambition . I also had reason to wonder if some of her memories of me were not so pleasant . " I 'd thought you 'd be somebody calling to chide me about my current cargo . But this has got to be about some past crime of mine , if not some crime to come . " Spiders all think industrial diplomacy is a crime ; they may be right . Japril went from smile to grin with those big teeth of hers . " Actually , it 's neither . " Her fingers came together on the golden bar . ( Calculator ? Energy knife ? Water purifier ? ) " Relax . What do you know of Rhyonon ? " A memory of Clym ; and a chill . " Only that no one is supposed to know that much about it . " Funny thing about that chill . It did n't subside . There 's something permanently scary about an entire world 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rescue operations ? The few thounds we got out , say , or the few colony ships the Web managed to oad up in hours and evacuate during the course of the disaster ? The survivors we managed to pry out of the peripheral ruins and smoking wreckage once the major conflagration was over ? " The Web is information ; it 's silly to lie to a spider , especially one with that many rays rainbowing her sunburst . " Nothing . " " I know , " she said . " There were n't any . At least of those . " See what I mean . " You want to know where I am . " Japril 's fingers moved absently on the stick . ( Sound recorder ? Cosmetics case ? Musical instrument ? ) Possibly having something to do with it , possibly not , minors blanked out among us ; reflections vanished . Behind Japril a wide , indistinct window looked out on a brown landscape , boxed and blotted with architectural oddities , some angular , some freeform , many connected by arching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm at a rescue station on the sixth moon of Chyvon , in the Tyon-omega system ; Chyvon 's a gas giant one out from Rhyonon . Within an hour of the catastrophe , a rescue station was set up on Rhyonon 's nearest moon and an overflow station here . " " Then some did get out . . . ? " hearing , as I said it , how ridiculous it sounded . With two years planning , you can lift a few thousand women from one world and relocate them on another . How many can you evacuate within minutes ? " The station on Rhyonon 's moon was closed down to a skeleton staff within a hundred hours after the catastrophe . " " I would have thought that the majority of the refugees ? " I felt strange calling the survivors of an entire world refugees ? " would have been brought to the nearer station . " " The reason we maintain the skeleton staff on Rhyonon 's moon is at least to suggest  --  to those who 're suggestible  --  the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't one . . . ? " " As far as illusions go , it 's pretty paltry . Believe me , I was n't in favor of it when it was decided on . " " Japril , " I said . " Are there any survivors at all ? " She took a long time to say : " Yes . "  | " And they 're not on Rhyonon 's moon , but rather on that moon of .. . Chyvon , with you ? " She took an even longer time to nod  --  throwing me to all thosr far-flung cultures where a nod does not necessarily signal affirmation . But they were not Japril 's . Nonchalantly as I could manage , I asked : " How many ? " One reason Japril became friends with me in the first place is because of her uncanny ability to see through my diplomatic masks , " Why do n't I tell you , instead , your relation to this survivor , Marq ? " " You mean this woman is a factor in my life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notable relation . And do n't discount rumor . It 's the real order of business this evening . " ( Where I was , I was thinking of it this afternoon . But no matter . ) " I 've noted that relation ? " " And the Web wants to exploit it . Which is why you 've called on me to talk about it  --  across nine thousand light-years . " One reason I became friends with Japril is because of how quickly her ambitious and devious plans open all their exfoliations to my view . " There is a survivor , is n't there ? At least one . " Really , I was thinking of Clym far more than the various suggestions Japril had all but thrown in front of me . " We 've had Rat Korga here at the station for . . . " There was relief in her voice as she said the name to me for the first time ; and I got a sense that this was something she had not talked about with many people ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle was something she had wanted to do for : " ? well , for a while now . " " Let me tell you about Rhyonon , Marq . Sit back and I 'll catalogue the horrors . I 've done it in enough reports that I can recite it in my sleep . The flame shell , " Japril said , " where it roared across Rhyonon 's surface , was over fifty thousand feet high  --  which effectively did in any passing air travel . Most of the actual holocaust was confined to the equatorial areas . So was ninety percent of Rhyonon 's population . The resultant gaseous toxins alone , not to mention the incredible  | heatstorms that went raging out north and south , pretty wets mu In use parts of the world that were not directly burned . Winds over the whole planet rose to nearly six hundred kilometers an hour . In ten hours , the major flaming areas had more or less burned themselves out . with twelve percent of the planetary surface fused and the atmosphere radically deoxygenated . How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got a flicker . No , do n't say anything . Just let me go on . In seventeen hours , there was an average drop in temperature recorded over the general surface down to a hundred degrees celsius , or even below that , here and there ; and the average was falling . Because we have to mark it somewhere , this is now considered the official termination of the catastrophe , though there were still seas of hundred-fifty-degree muck bubbling around , on places that had never seen temperatures above twenty-five degrees celsius before . Choosing the real moment of termination over something the size of a planet is rather like deciding where the edge of an atomic mushroom cloud is with a ten centimeter rule . But less than twenty hours after the disaster 's commencement we were actually flying through that planetary murk . Marta was glum ; and Ynn was putting out the forced cheerfulness that only makes the glum get angry . I called myself keeping my mind on the controls ; and never have bothered to ask what I looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took us half an hour 's flying over thousands on thousands of square kilometers of lava fields , in the midst of which had once been some of Rhyonon 's major civilized cities of millions , to realize it was a pretty useless search . And how many hours was it after that , our scouting ships veered north and south toward the poles ? How many scouting ships were there ? And why was ours , among the hundreds called down to quarter and requarter the assigned areas , the one to make the strike ? Suddenly our radar , peeking through the blackened air , came back with the ruin of a building . You have to understand that in places where a day ago there had been urban complexes as big as Vongle or Rimena ? " Japril and I had met in Vongle afloat on Pattuck 's southeastern seas ? " there were only puddles of boiling mud . Large puddles , too . The deserts in the south had just been scorched  --  which is to say , that for a few hours a wind somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred k 's an hour over them , which was enough to do in any but  | the staunchest surface structures and pretty well all animal life ; not to mention plants . " And there was . .. a ruin ! " We sat our three-girl boat down beside it . The air was un breathable  --  we had to go clomping out through the portal tube in heavy heat suits , because the temperature even here was still in the neighborhood of sixty degrees . Walking across the sand toward the broken walls , Ynn 's boot toe struck a pile of rubble falling away from something which , as we gathered around it and kicked away more dust , was clearly some desiccated transport machine . " Within the roofless walls themselves , there was sand almost a foot deep over what turned out to be thermoplastic floorplates . There was also almost a complete lack of information about what function the station had served or who its inhabitants had been . " Only one of us  --  Ynn  --  had bothered to learn any of the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You and I , Marq , would have probably considered Rhyonon a fairly primitive place . They did n't have a General Info system , for what seemed to be essentially religious reasons . They 'd even been trying to legislate against the one the Web had set up on their nearer moon and not succeeding . On one of the few strings of cubes lying around that had n't melted beyond decipherment , on which they did their hieroglyphic insect-scratchings , Ynn found mention of a hermetically self-sealing underground refrigerator and storage crypt . Should we investigate ? ( Since the air was too thick to see through , inside what remained of the building , we watched each other in stereo schemas formed of little colored squares , reduced from infrared reflections , on stereo face plates inside our masks . ) Why not ? Back outside , where everything was scrimmed with dirty gold , and the stereo plates could be raised for simple glass  --  as long as you were n't trying to make out details on anything more than a meter away  --  we hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churn sand . And that 's when Marta , inside the ship for something , called out that the biodetectors , which till now we 'd all but forgotten , were blipping and pinging like mad . " Something was down there  --  and alive ! " Marta 's first guess was that it was some kind of plankton farm below  --  perhaps the bacterial decay that had gotten started on the  | u trains of some par-boiled algae . But the tine-tuning on me uetcctuars told us the major form was almost certainly animal , not vegetable . Mice ? was Ynn 's suggestion  --  they 've gone with humanity everyvk here else . Fleas ? Some local paramecia who 'd managed to escape trying ? We tunneled and delved , furious as banshees , at the same time refusing to believe what the detector  --  with each ton of sand and flag the excavator 's blade heaved up over the crater 's rim  --  was insisting . You have no idea what it 's like to come upon something the size of a world where less than a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to discover that now everything even resembling ' a molecule of ATP has been reduced to salts , gas , and water . Marta was putting up heat screens and clean-air traps as fast as Ynn could push away the rubble with the excavator . Using relay lines to the lunar GI system  --  the local signal jammers had been knocked out by the catastrophe  --  we 'd all managed to become experts in any number of fancy rescue and medical techniques over the previous three hours . I was darting in and out of our ship , looking over the edge of the pit ? swirling with smoke  --  then running inside again to see it on the screen in infrared , which cut out all the haze and where you had the advantage of being able to vary the focal length . We 're through ! ' Ynn called over the earphones ; and Marta brought in her last bubbledome , digging various polyisoprene walls well down in the sizzling sand . ( I was out again . ) Through plastic panes I saw sand fall inward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bubble itself was flooded with a gas mixture five degrees cooler and ten percent richer in oxygen  --  we figured no matter what was in there in the line of animal life , that would have to be an improvement . Then we were scrambling down ourselves and through the floppy plastic envelopes , with all sorts of suspensor stretchers , medical kits , flares , and stun-guns bobbling along behind us . In our great mittens , we climbed down through the welter of twisted pipes and cracked masonry , shooting cool air around us with super-handy-dandy portable air conditioners . It was over forty degrees in there when we went in . We sent out beams of white , blue , and green light among the collapsed lattices of crumpled supports and broken pipes . It had been seven minutes since we got the first life-reading  --  but we 'd all been working with x5 time-dilation drugs , which had made it seem to us just over a leisurely half-hour . Yellow , orange , and red beams  | converged . In the resultant glow , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a leg . " Ynn set loose a handful of diagnostic bugs that attacked our find like killer bees . But even as we were closing in , it was pretty clear that something fairly awful had happened . " I started to say something was pinning the leg down " But , frankly , there was n't much leg left . Twenty seconds later ( divided by five ) the bugs reported , on the little screens flickering on the left sides of our vision plates : our survivor was also blind . " Other reports were coming back now from the host of analyzers flitting and humming around the crypt , taking their readings and making their correlations : some time in the first few minutes of the catastrophe , one of ten giant refrigeration coils had ruptured and for seconds the space had been flooded with fluorine , before the gas had been removed , a minute later , by the sluggish purifiers , their effi ciency hugely reduced by the high heat . Fortunately , for most of that minute , the survivor had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respiratory system alone would have been fatal . That minute , by the bye , was to give us a lot of trouble over the next few days . " But we got our survivor bubbled , sedated , aerated , and suspensored . In the midst of sealing up the plastic shield over the stretcher , there was some ghastly , basso grunt that threatened to topple towers and shatter eardrums  --  a human groan , but to us , thanks to the drugs , five octaves lower than uttered . " Then we were pushing the stretcher along and up and between broken ledges . Outside the shield , flying dust had already peppered the transparent plastic with enough grit to blacken whatever we had been able to see before in the gray and mustard mists . And timecompressants were winding us down from the dilation drugs . ( More than ten minutes is bad for your heart  --  and terrible for your kidneys . ) In the sealed stretcher tube , the fellow was already being ministered to by threads of light that had pretty well woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new one for him from the remains of the old . We got the stretcher out of the envelope flap , floated it across the sands ( I swear the dunes had been blown into entirely different shapes in the minute we 'd been down ) and through our ship lock . Bubbles coursed the pale gold liquid that filled the container , carry- ing newly cloned cells to the proper locations and flushing away the damages . The survivor ... " " Japril , " I said , after moments when she had remained silent , " I 've heard that term before . Now you 've said it , I have to say : I ca n't believe that over the surface of an entire world , any catastrophe short of the whole planet 's physically blowing up could manage to do in every member of the population with only one exception ? " The survivor was , by now , being monitored and observed by twelve hundred other rescue workers still searching and quartering Rhyonon 's steaming , storm-scoured surface , looking for others with one added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I was thinking : You could bring in twelve hundred workers to look for survivors in one undersea magma-mine disaster . A world ... ? ) " Our ship lurched up , and we rose above that noxious desert , bearing what we would soon learn was a hugely ruined creature , healing now in our biotic tubs . " " And you brought her here , " I said . " Which is to say  --  there , where you are . But why are you ? " Japril 's foreknuckles came together on the gold bar . ( A work of art ? A medical device ? A child 's toy ? ) " We 're talking of this survivor ? the survivor that concerns you . "  | " Japril , " I said . " I do n't know why I keep asking . But I suppose it 's because the implied answer just always seems wrong . Tell me  --  or tell me why the Web does n't want me to know : exactly how many survivors were there from Rhyonon ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anyone does : it 's your question that 's impossible . Three thousand volunteers in a colonial ship bound for the Mie-t &t; VII colony had left Rhyonon 's surface six hours before the holocaust commenced . All of them are alive today ; and none of them knows what 's happened to her former home . Were they survivors ? There are thousands upon thousands more , born on Rhyonon over the last hundred years , who now live on a moon or a world or an 0'n-colony circling some moon or world , having left a day or a year or a decade ago . Are they survivors ? Or the how-many from other worlds , other moons , within hours or minutes or days of visiting or returning to Rhyonon , whose flights were then cancelled ? not to mention the seven hundred and fifty-eight incoming offworld flights that we were able to deflect , within minutes of the disaster 's commencement , to moons or other planets . Were they survivors ? " " What about the five , or fifty , or five hundred you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've always liked her for . " I could give you two answers . First , it 's not my department . Second , there were two-hundred-seven of those . In seventeen cases , the Web was actually able to effect some midair transfers of passengers and crews that , if there 's going to be any excitement about the Rhyonon rescue operations , ought to be at the center of it . " " All right , Japril , " I said . " I hear what you 're saying . With a population as large as a world can have and a disaster of Cultural Fugue proportions , survival ' becomes a kind of fuzzy phenomenon ; it 's not the hard-edged fact of local fires , floods , and hurricanes . Go on and tell me about my relations to ? " I laughed . " You know , I 'd started to say my ' survivor . " " Our survivor , " Japril said ruefully , " presented a host of medical problems , once we lifted that bruised and ruptured half-corpse off the steaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too much of Rhyonon . " When we got a full diagnosis of the blindness , we thought we had hit the major medical hurdle . " ( Something General Info has returned to us : one or two people can see a whole project through from start to finish , even if various stages in it demand three or four or fifty fields of extensive specialized knowledge . That the Web is the most constant utilizer of the newest facets of GI should be no surprise . They invented it . ) " The whole front orbital surface , of both whites and corneas , was corroded  --  thanks to that fluorine . And inside , the retinas had been perforated in half a hundred places and the humors generally congealed as solid as boiled albumin  --  which can be dealt with . But the interior eyeball lining had become granulated and would clearly become a suppurating hive of problems in no time , even if all the works were restored . You ca n't deal with that . Which meant the eyes themselves had to be replaced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were actually some around , since we were only a moon away . Marta hit up GI for some quick courses in optical surgery and wired them in . . . . Under dim light , Marq , the new eyes look like black-backed globes of clear glass . In ordinary light , they are your usual , faintly veined white with irises of a green substantially more vivid than the true irises originally were . In bright light they turn a disquieting silver . You know ? " Japril frowned ? " there 's an odd thing about  | the sociology of prosthetic devices . When a culture first develops the technology to counterfeit a human function , the counterfeit is usually awkward and jarring . But when the culture reaches a technological stage beyond that , the prostheses are made to look as much like the original organ as possible . Now when a stage beyond that is reached , suddenly the prostheses are consciously constructed to call attention to themselves in aesthetically interesting ways . In fact , limited techno logical stages can be meaningfully described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japril , " I said , " you are telling me , in your own inimitable way , Rhyonon 's culture had reached a level two stages beyond that needed to create a functional optical prosthesis . But we only have a limited amount of conference time . You have n't told me ? " " We set the survivor 's waking for an hour after our own the next day . Rest is still the best cure for that kind of bodily trauma : new leg , new eyes . We came into the rotunda of the rescue station here , wondering if the pale blue walls and the wall window , beyond which sprawled only lunar schist and craters , were really conducive to the best revival . Had we done certain neurological tests ? Certainly . Had we done others ? Well , now . . . we 'd done enough to determine that we had no major deficiencies to deal with . There were signs of the most minor prenatal brain damage that may have been due to potassium starvation in the bearing parent . But neural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had neither a genius nor an idiot on our hands . That we knew . How did we go about telling someone in the huge range we humans have generally set out for ourselves as normal that their world is . . . gone ? " A hundred lights , each a different color , died in the froth of glycerine that washed about that human-shaped bath . Tubes drained off the puce and fuchsia biles that , in a sort of antidigestive process , had , by their chemical actions , healed ; had , by their tidal actions , exercised . Molecular gradients were read across sheets of tissue ; neural charges were positioned down to the synapse and detonated . " The right arm twitched . " For a moment the left hand 's knuckles were four bubbly islands in the trough 's syrup . A knee flexed from thick liquid . " Then , dripping , the survivor sat . " You understand , Marq , I had never seen such a waking , but GI  | had given me the recalls to call on of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  watched the coughing , the shaking head , the neural twitches as the nerves came on again , the unsteady motor orientation of an old nervous system taking over a radically reprocessed body , the ten-to-twenty minutes ' limping to accommodate the inevitable discrepancies in neural firing times of the nerves in the new leg , the two-to-five hours of increased blinking to acclimate to the just-connected optic nerve . " The survivor sat , to the waist , in foam . " The survivor coughed . " The survivor raised both hands and , with two thick and awkward forefingers , rubbed away the juices from each lid in a single downward motion . The tub began to tip , and Ynn automatically stepped forward to give a hand , that , clearly , as our healed creature stepped forward among the railings and handholds now , was not needed . " There was no stagger at all . " The eyes  --  bright green under our lights  --  were wide . With all that lubricating syrup , physiologically there is no need to blink for a full three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing blinks . A lot . " The survivor did n't ; but rather looked about . Marta made a gesture with her hand beside her face that showed she was empathizing with the queasiness we knew was being felt but , nevertheless , did not show . With a supporting ring in each large hand  --  so very tall  --  the survivor stood , for all the world ( the world . . . ? which world ? ) like someone waiting . No questions , no curious glances , no self-orienting looks ; naked thighs streamed , and the drain gurgled behind wide heels . " I said softly to Ynn : Perhaps that brain damage . . . ? ' " Ynn said sharply : Who are you ? Tell us your name . We want to help you , ' in the most common of Rhyonon 's six languages . We knew that twenty-four percent of Rhyonon 's population was  --  or had been  --  bilingual , with the most common language either the first or second tongue of that three-quarters . " The survivor was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any particular intensity . Still , because that face so clearly was n't paying attention to what Ynn was saying , it made me want to  | look over my shoulder to see what those eyes were seeing , even though I knew it was only blue plastifoam . " Ynn said : Who are you ? Tell us your name . We want to help you , ' in the second most common of Rhyonon 's six languages . " The survivor said : Korga the Porter . . . Rat ... " The last was a term I did n't know , though by now I 'd been programmed with four advanced courses in Rhyonon linguistic patterns  --  enough to locate that accent as a pidgin version of the speech associated with the urban equatorial slums . Though just which slum , I could n't tell . " The survivor still did n't look at us . " There was something about . . . the height , the roughness of the body , the stubble darkening the male jaw , the unexpectedly steady gaze of those eyes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japril ? " I laughed ? " I thought you were going to tell me my relation to this character was that I happened to be her perfect look-alike , or perhaps among six thousand worlds ' population , we happen to have turned out genotypal twins . And male , you say . I 'd just assumed ? " " Rough , black hair , " Japril went on , " sun-darkened skin .. . from what we know of Rhyonon 's demographics and colonizations records , chances are almost thirty percent of the ancestry was white . The face , Marq , was uneven and pitted ? " " Sounds like the scars of a very rare disease called acne , " I volunteered . " When I was ten , I encountered a population where it was rife . On that moon , in fact , both the males and the females considered it a mark of great distinction ? " which was not quite accurate . " I 've always agreed . " Japril 's smile said more things than I could read in it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about how to express it later . Consider a mask of terra cotta . Now take a jeweler 's hammer , strike it from behind , then , before the first cracks appear on the surface , catch a picture from the front . There was that about the face , Marq . The survivor stepped forward , now , unsteadily . The disorientation we expected from fear , from displacement , from remembered terror at whatever had happened a world , two eyes , and a leg ago was just not there . Those eyes now looked at Ynn , at Marta , at me.  | Over seven feet tall : two heads taller than me and almost as tall as Ynn ; and the distinctions among those long , long muscles were different from the ones a woman 's take on in a gymnasium program to bring out the body 's lines . " I 've seen worlds where women 's physical labor was a prime commodity . The physicality was much more like that than such a ? " " And I 've seen women from labor-intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds , Japril . You make this survivor very vivid to me . " " Do I ? To me , it all was a bit horrifying . There was a solidness , a dullness , an unresponsiveness that lay out on the ceramic flesh , still glazed with our oils , like an underfinish keeping the surface glaze from exploding . Though I knew I was watching a human , I kept trying to decide what genus , what species ? " " Japril , " I said , laughing , " I know some Sygn priests who 'd call you a blasphemer . " " When a world is destroyed  --  a whole world , Marq  --  there are so many fuzzy-edged phenomena that to speak of the event at all is to broach blasphemy . I watched , Marq . And what I sensed , Marta saw . She said something to Ynn , who glanced at me , then looked back . What can be talked of clearly , General Info can teach you in under three-tenths of a second . " ( That 's the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case you 're interested  --  the amount of time required to memorize with GI , say , the Oneirokritika by heart . ) " The rest one must mumble about , either loudly or quietly as is one 's temperament . Marta began to make quiet mumbles  --  as do most spiders from any of ten worlds I can mention in her home Web-sector  --  punctuated with the likes of ... severe disorientation . . . sociopathology . . . no clearly damaged . . while Ynn said in her high , sharp voice : " Well , of course , Japril , after all the trauma suffered , there have to be , almost predictably , some unpredictable results . We found that slight brain damage , supposedly compensated for . But that is n't normal neural material for a normal neural reaction to waking with no world on a strange moon . Our charge 's world has been destroyed . None of us knows that world by anything but report . The truth is , in subjective terms , we do n't know how strange this place is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any combination of the two , and at any level of resolution . ' " And Marta shook her head , whispering : ... remapping of neuronal deployment .. " After several hand signals , indicating hope and despair in her own religion , Ynn depressed a small pedal : . and the survivor 's eyes closed . " The knees bent . " The metal floor tipped back to topple the figure into the tub , while the drains reversed to become gargling tributaries . As the body bobbed about , we went through a dozen access catalogues , had a dozen GI programs erased from our minds , and took on some thirty more between us . And we remapped the survivor . " " For the next three days we remapped . " We viewed through diverse screens and measured with sundry meters each neuronal center and margin , plumbed and monitored and analyzed the chemical context in which each synapse drowned ; our computers recorded the ionic dance along a billion nerve sheaths . Our simulators produced conglomerate vector templates in four dimensions and thirteen colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only what GI so quaintly calls a footnote ' to an auxiliary program Marta had added almost as an afterthought that finally guided us to the answer : Something very odd has been done , Japril  --  probably done a long time ago , too . What 's more , if it is the synapse-jamming the footnote says it is , on most worlds it 's illegal ! ' We gazed , regazed , reprobed , and reread among the synaptic netpatterns ' possibilities of meaning . ( They unpack , like any text , not always with what has been packed into them . ) Then we turned to the Web 's Basic Galactic Information map of data-deployment to see if we could locate the proper data-node that would explain the particular biotechnic operation all our researches seemed to indicate . " The particular method for taking the living brain and doing the kind of synapse-jamming that had apparently been done  --  perhaps some twenty standard years ago  --  to Korga the Porter , Rat , was first  | vented on a world in the seventy-eighth cluster some four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forty-eighth clusters simultaneously and independently ( as far as we can tell ) about two hundred and eighty years back just prior to the time of Vondramach t ) k k , as a matter of fact . " " Should I say something ? " " It 's relevant , " said Japril . " You 'll see why in a moment . The information had spread slowly from its first source , hindered by law and the civil outrage that can accompany any human discovery women find destructive ; it had spread quickly from the latter two sources , camouflaged by a far more liberal attitude toward research when not simply hidden in the information glut that has been the hallmark of more recent times  --  the glut that is the reason , purpose , and responsibility of the Web . The three data-flows converged on the worlds of the fortieth sector some fifty years ago . " Such data convergences on the worlds of a single star system from so many directions frequently make an information-stable node that is very hard to control . If the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under control , it simply pops up under another name in the same place  --  or right next door . The particular synapse-jamming procedure that we had on our hands in Korga , once we recognized it and traced its diachronic trajectory through the fortieth cluster 's general episteme , had proved particularly tenacious . And because Rhyonon was a world out of the main data channels that are central to the Web , not much energy had been expended on it . The synapse-jamming technique first surfaced on a moon of Rhyonon 's cousin world , Jesper , here in the Tyon-omega system , as a medical method for dealing with certain social intractables . It was squelched by the Web as inhumane and was finally superseded , on that moon , by a program of drug therapy that was easier , cheaper , more efficient for its purposes , and  --  for that particular moon ? ecologically sounder . " It reemerged on Rhyonon itself as a rite in a political movement that had begun gaining wide adherence several hundred years ago . Then there was a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have had something to do with the early conflicts between the Sygn and the Family  --  and immediately it resurfaced as part of the practice of an extremely violent art form : for some twenty-five  | years during Rhyonon 's second century many of the artists in various geosectors of Rhyonon 's southern hemisphere , when the emotional stringencies of their craft became too great , would voluntarily subject themselves to this form of mental suicide  --  during which time the practice gained great social prestige . " The Web launches , as you probably know , a very different kind of campaign against an aesthetic institution from the sort it launches against a medical one  --  some say the former is no campaign at all . We try to contour an alternative aesthetic stream away from conceptualization and toward representation . Periods of high-resolution representative art , in whatever field , seem to be local phenomena on any world at all . They never last . But the swing , when we tried it on Rhyonon , was enough , according to our records , to make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that Rhyonon was , as are most of the worlds in the fortieth sector , a terribly unimportant world in the Web 's scheme of things . It was uncommitted in a conflict that had already taken over nine percent of the six thousand two hundred worlds . It had no General Info system , and its approach to offworld information in general was unsympathetic to say the least . " The synapse-jamming technique came back once more , this time as a gesture of public philanthropy . The destitute of Rhyonon 's most impoverished social classes , about thirty standard years back , had apparently been allowed  --  by inter-geosector law  --  governmentsubsidized access to this most sophisticated technique of Radical Anxiety Termination , ' as the Institute administering it was known . " I nodded . " If museums are open to the public , then we must make available as well all the strategies the artist uses to contour the particular problems of her life . I 've encountered the syndrome before . " " It 's not a privileged one , " Japril said , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in her presumably multilensed eye , some industrial diplomat 's odd datum was not privileged either . " So now we had a good statistical context within which to read the signs we had been presented with . Given what we now knew of Rhyonon , her language deployment , and Korga 's accent , we had established a good statistical probability that our survivor , though found at the pole , was from the sociopathic dregs of one of Rhyonon 's equatorial slums . At some time in the past Korga had apparently been  | offered , by a benevolent society , a chance at what had been up till recently , on his world , the ave atque vale of artists and priests : the chance to have the paths in the brain through which worry forces us to grow closed over forever and detours about those troublesome crossroads left permanently open . " I raised my chin , which is a sign to continue in the language spoken in the west of Japril 's home world ( I wondered if she remembered telling me ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or doubt . She said : " The rest of the statistical range  --  much smaller  --  includes the possibilities of artist , religious thinker , philosopher , or even an industrial entrepreneur who , after having amassed a fortune but never having bothered to correct her accent ( such corrections were apparently done in urban equatorial Rhyonon ) , suddenly opted for the Termination treatment . " I frowned . " Radical Anxiety Termination . . . Does that have anything to do with his name , Rat . . . ? An acronym of some sort ? " " The Universe is overdetermined , ' " Japril quoted . " About seventy-five years ago on Rhyonon , an ideographic writing system was instituted worldwide , in an attempt to clear up the confusion of some five alphabetic systems and syllabaries that had come with the various colonial groups . Since then , all official business had been conducted in ideographics . But such slang and many old terms are best explained by one of the older scripts . The second most common language of Rhyonon as well as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up with ? though I doubt whether Rat Korga would understand the explanation . " " I 'm not truly sure I do either . Go on , Japril . " " When doctors think they 've eradicated a disease , they stop looking for it . So if the disease itself suddenly shows up again , they may not even recognize it ; they may even mistake it for an entirely new one . We were lucky to have diagnosed the synapse-jamming for what it was as quickly as we did  --  since on Rhyonon it was not even considered pathological . But the location of the proper antidote , in such cases , can be even more difficult than diagnosis . " " Why does the Web consider the situation pathological , Japril ? " " You must remember ? " Japril was smiling again ? " Rhyonon had no General Information system . It 's precisely those anxiety '  | channels which Radical Anxiety Termination blocks that GI uses both to process into the brain the supportive contextual information in the preconscious that allows you to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates , verbatim texts , and multiplication tables ; and it also uses them to erase an information program in such a way that you can still remember the parts of it you 've actually used consciously . " " What you 're saying is that Rat Korga can never get all those little neurological transmitters wired into the crevices of the top five vertebrae that will hook into whatever local GI system happens to be around . " I frowned . " Coming from a completely destroyed culture into something as complex as the Web , not to mention other worlds , and without the help of GI  --  that could be hard . " " Even harder when you consider that Korga began with what you and I would call a hopelessly impoverished information battery . The thing anyone dealing with Rat Korga must remember  --  and Rat ' you understand is . . . was a kind of title , and , on Rat 's own world , a pejorative title at that  --  is that this woman was a hugely informatively deprived individual from a generally informatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synaptic deployment . As Korga bobbed quietly in healthful juices and restorative fluids , we came to watch at , and lean against , and look through , with our palms up beside our cheeks , the slanted viewing windows  --  their lower sashes sloughed with froth and squamous scum . " We had discovered the problem in three days  --  No , just let me go on . I do n't even want to tell you how long it took to discover the answer . " I dared : " What was it ? " " Ynn found it  --  and by an accident that , as I remember now , seems no more probable than the one by which we discovered Korga himself . You and Ynn share an enthusiasm , Marq . " " We do ? " " I mean the period some two hundred-odd standard years ago at the height of the Family 's power and the reign of Vondramach Okk over the seventeen worlds . " " I would n't exactly call it enthusiasm , " I said . " There are some traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that was going on . And I like her poems . But for me personally , the period 's  | ardly something I could even call an interest , " which is not quite curate either . There is Dyethshome . " Well , " Japril said , " back when you and I were more friendly than of late , you mentioned it to me enough times so that when Ynn came up with this I thought of you . " " What exactly was it ? " For Ynn , this period is an enthusiasm , a passion , an obsession  --  as , Indeed , is everything connected with the life of Vondramach . Relaxing one evening in her living room , it occurred to her to run an exhaustive GI cross-check between all the information currently at hand on Rat and all the documentation on her personal hobby , Vondramach . All she was looking for , she told us later , was metaphorical similarities that might provide an amusing hour 's musings . She sat down on her hammock , thought over the access numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GI do its work . Then  --  there it was in her mind : the access numbers to a loosely documented historical program on Okk 's youth that she had never run into before . Even for an expert , of course , there 'd be thousands of those ? " " Japril , " I said , " I 've spent all my life on worlds with extensive GI systems . " She suddenly shook her head . " Really  --  you must forgive me . I 'm beginning to wonder if I have n't been closeted with Korga just a little too long . One gets into the habit with Rat of explaining everything . Anyway , there it was , beeping like mad and demanding a referential check . Later Ynn said she had been familiar with a number of loosely documented accounts of Vondramach 's youth referring to the early experiments with mind-distorting and dilating drugs , neural-tampering machines , and medical-based consciousness-bending techniques . What she had n't known was that before the age of twenty-three Okk had indulged in enough such to kill permanently anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Vondramach had available . Through self-mutilation and other fun things she 'd had to replace most of her vascular , muscular , and skeletal systems , as well as a good deal of neural matter , several times over . And when the synapse-jamming techniques we 're talking about , spreading from the seventy-eighth sector , first reached Vondramach 's attention , she was fascinated by its possibilities . Even then  --  especially back then  --  it was billed as a permanent change . But things like that did n't bother  | her . One morning she went in and had her brain jammed . Predictably , after a few days , she decided she did n't like it . And there were already other things she wanted to inflict on herself . But the jamming takes place within synapses set fairly deep in the brain , kept open or closed by setting up a small , naturally self-reinforcing feedback loop that is at once extremely delicate and extremely tenacious . It can be started by the merest brush of a finely modulated gamma-ray laser over the proper chemical gradient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cerebral pelvises . The only way to stop it , however , is to surgically excise the neural material , or to short it out totally  --  the side effects of which are not only unpleasant but frequently fatal . And the most disconcerting of the side effects is that the whole pattern , if it is erased in one part of the brain , tends to he remembered by the rest and  --  assuming you survive excision or shortout  --  usually reestablishes itself somewhere else almost immediately . " " It 's one of those . . . ? " Japril nodded . " You do n't know that much about neural cartography , Marq . " She smiled . " And you know that the one thing we know is just how much you know about practically anything . Anyway , Vondramach Okk , unlike Korga , who only had what Marta , Ynn , and I could ferret out of GI to help , was directly in touch , even by then , with the complete medical resources of eight high-technology worlds  --  five of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially owned . That technology had already generated the beginnings of what was to become GI 's direct neural access system . Vondramach gave an order : Fix this mess , and fast . . . ! ' or an order that boiled down to the same thing . It was the kind she had given many times before . According to this particular loosely documented report , she got what she wanted . " We 've borrowed it . " " What did it turn out to be , Japril ? "  | " Finding it began with a reference number to a sealed storage chamber in the uninventoried sections of wing seven of the Okk Museum on Tartouhm . " ( I once spent a week in a vaurine projection of one of the Okk Museum 's twenty-nine wings  --  the one where they put the Louvre , the Palazzo Vecchio , and the Vatican Library collections that Vondramach had exported , building at a time , to the wing 's lower rotunda , from the ruins of Old Eyrth during the first days of the Seventh K'Tong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's guess . A momentary memory of those six hours a day touring , absorbing the most minor fragments of the age my great-grands used to gossip about . ) " We opened it up , " Japril said , " and looked inside . " I raised an eyebrow . " Physically ? " " We sent a message to open it , had the contents described minutely , and the description and vaurines sent back . You know Vondramach Okk : when she ordered something done , she did n't just have it done once . When she needed a prosthesis  --  and throughout her life , what with assassination attempts , not to mention some of her own more bizarre pastimes , she went through quite a number  --  she usually had  | between fifty and a few hundred made up , each slightly different , from among which she took her pick . " ( We 've mentioned several times how big a world is ? Now imagine owning some . ) " What was inside that neglected vault ? A set of ornate finger rings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were small enough to fit a three-year-old child to another dozen big as bracelets for that same child . " " What did they turn out to be ? " Japril 's left hand danced on what might have been a piece of jewelry , the key to  --  or the catalogue of  --  her personal wardrobe , or the next month 's orders for her and the spiders in her nest . " They were hard-circuitry replacements , of an astonishingly sophisticated kind given the year they were constructed , to counterfeit the Usual operations of the jammed neurons . They feed the results directly back into the nervous system , but with large informative nets added in . The rings get their information ' into the brain by using the sheathing impedance of the whole neural web as its general neural receptor . " " Could you use them on Rat ? " " We wondered about that a lot . Unlike our Korga , Vondramach Okk was not , for all her failings , an informatively deprived sociopath . If anything , she was a hopelessly privileged psychopath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two shared few or no deep freeafferent synaptic configurations . The rings , however , were not constructed with the individualized synapse tailoring we use today to hook the neural receivers and transmitters into children to connect them with GI , or to allow them to use mentally activatable equipment . Instead , they bombard the more complex neural webs with blanket information matrices at every free entrance point . " " Was the technology available to recreate them for you ? " " Once we figured out what they were  --  with the help of the little booklet stashed down in the case  --  we had a set of them from among those that were the proper size shipped out . " " The rings Vondramach wore ? " " That Vondramach wore some of , some of the time , from among some of those that would fit her . Whether she wore them permanently , or whether some more refined neurological compensation was eventually developed for her is just one of those things about her that is n't documented . "  | " I gather there were times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , so the Dyeth tradition has it , she 'd destroy quite at random great portions of the records that accumulated about " ? and still managed , at least for most of her adult life , to be the ost documented human being in the universe . " Suddenly Japril aughed again . " But the thing you can be sure of in this day and age Is that no one is the most ' of anything ; just the most ' you happen to know about . Marq , we had the rings imported ? " " This survivor , Korga , is very important to the Web .... Who was the ID on the import job , by the bye ? " " No one you 're related to , or who would be likely to let you pump them about the matter . " " Perish the thought ! " Japril let several odd and unsettling expressions flow along her long , handsome face . " We 've already talked of the fuzziness ' about the concept of a world-survivor . But there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known , all along . " She settled on one with the corners of her mouth way down . " Whether the phenomenon is fuzzy or not , a growing number of people , despite all the Web has tried to do to prevent it , consider Rat Korga the single survivor of a totally depopulated world . " " Backtrack a little , Japril . " I admit it . Vondramach had pricked my curiosity . " What sorts of information were in those rings ? " " Very basic stuff . " The corners of Japril 's mouth went back up . " Remarkably close to a first-order GI series , actually : mathematical tables , general vocabulary accretion lattices , metonymic multipliers , some spatial and temporal prompters , temporary term retainers , and mnemonic nudges  --  the sort of aids that would make anyone seem brighter , without necessarily influencing their basic opinions about anything . " " Nothing to influence opinion , ' " I quoted an early critic of the GI system , " and everything to alter belief . ' Were there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Those are the subconscious systems by which you decide whether other people possess a context for understanding what you want to say or not , and , if not , for adding appropriate contextual material to your own communication . Another name for it is  --  you  | guessed it  --  diplomacy . ) " Data reverse-retrieval seems to have been one of Vondramach 's prime concerns , if one can go by the rings ' contained programs . " " I 'm not really surprised . So . . . these are the things that are erased from the normal brain by the synapse-jamming process ? " An even stranger expression took over Japril 's face . " These are among the things thought to be able to compensate for some of the jamming effects  --  back in Vondramach 's era . " The gold bar , with its two black knobs , suddenly went into a side pocket of Japril 's vest . I actually felt a regretful hitch that now I 'd probably never find out what it was . " When we were checking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that a number of people had advanced the theory that the jamming produced , by artificial means , the neurological state achieved naturally by certain saints , mystics , and holy women . Presumably , they would go through alternate intellectual and spiritual disciplines to get there that would perhaps produce slightly different results  --  at any rate , the saintly bit was the part , of course , that interested Vondramach . " " Thanks to her Family connections , I know there were people who considered her a religious leader . But I do n't think anyone would call Vondramach a saint , " I said , " even for three days  --  or however long she was jammed . After you got the rings , what happened when you revived Korga again ? " " We emptied our survivor out of the slopping coffin . . . . " The frown on Japril 's face was suddenly readable distress . " Korga stood among the supports , not holding any of them , green eyes wide . Marta walked up , took the wet wrist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings on one and another great finger . " Japril joined her empty hands  --  which was what she used to do frequently when someone from the north of my world would simply sigh . " They fit . " It was only a blink . Marta started at it ; and the head turned a fraction to see her . " Ynn stood among the support loops , holding Korga 's fingers , still wet with our juices , bound now with metal , like something alive . . . . I described those great , rough hands , later , at least five times as like something alive ' before Marta said to me : But Japril , Korga 's hands are , ' and I had to paw over my memories of the waking to find what made me react as though they were not .  | " Who are you ? ' Ynn asked . The lips met , parted , halted . " ' Rat . . . Korga , ' Ynn said with an inflection that questioned as much as it stated . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balder , flatter voice , somehow reversed the weights of stated and questioning emphases within the single name . " ' What are you feeling , Rat Korga ? ' Marta asked from where she stood by aluminum and plastic struts . " Korga turned his head to look about our strange machines ( Why were most of them enameled green or yellow ? ) , at our walls ( Who decided they should be blue ? ) , out our windows ( What was the use of windows in such a moonscape ? ) . Where those alien eyes that we had loaned now looked , we interrogated everything . The eyes turned to Marta 's , to Ynn 's , to mine . ' I feel . . . more fear than I 've felt for ... many years . What do you want ? Why have you brought me here ? ' Korga was a terribly strong male ; and the hours of our ministrations had no doubt left her body stronger . But both our native logic and borrowed expertise said that strength should have been awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardness . " Korga looked at me ; and , while I tried to untangle the survivor 's unspoken questions from mine , Ynn , on the stand , said suddenly : " Your world , Rat . It 's gone . ' " Korga looked down where Ynn pressed those big fingers , heavy with new knowledge . " Ynn stepped back , her own hands wet with what had healed . " What . . . world ... ' Korga asked in a voice whose hoarse accents already spoke to us of old wounds in that throat we had n't even noticed . ' My . . . world .. " And suddenly , looking at Rat  --  tall , naked save a handful of rings  --  we felt cluttered with our own accoutrements : silver suits , bright insignias , recorders , calculators , reading machines hanging at belts and wrists . " ' Your relatives . They 're all dead . ' " Rat said , still looking down : ' I never had any relatives . ' " ' Your friends . They 're dead too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagonal movement of the head up , that we had  | learned , in Rhyonon 's second most common language , indicated negation . I do n't have any friends . ' " I said : The people you worked with , the place . . . it 's gone , Rat Korga . Everything you 've ever known . . . your work , all the things you did n't know that made what you did know what it was . Your world , it 's gone . ' " That big-boned , red-brown face watched me with a concern lacking all suspicion , with a vulnerability lacking all hostility . Their absences made me realize how used I was to ignoring them in the looks of others . " My world . . . ' Rat repeated . My work was n't much . All that 's gone ? Is that all ? ' Once more Rat looked around the room , at a machine , at a window , at one of us , at a floorlight . Now I am not as frightened as I was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw up amber illumination to underhook a knee , to catch in the foreskin 's wrinkled cuff , to shadow the curve of a vein along the scrotum and snarl in the hair above and around the genitals , to burnish the flesh below the naval 's cave and light that cave 's roof , to underlight a nipple and the roofs of smaller pits and dermal irregularities about the jaw , to illuminate beneath her brows . I watched and wondered where the hormonal tides and impedance gradients and saline shifts that constitute fear inscribed themselves on that lank body . " As Korga watched us , ringed and unringed hands came together . Once , Marq , on a frozen outpost where spines of black rock were strung with vines of a substance we were not sure was really alive or simply crystalline , a small , white , furry , and many-legged creature ? definitely alive and insistently friendly  --  became my companion . She was silent , curious , and affectionate . And I was alone . One day I found her pulling herself between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken . I picked her up in my thin gloves and carried her back to the compound , under the grainy sky . I called up three different GI programs on her alien anatomy , ethology , and convalescent patterns , which only confirmed what I knew and put off my doing it another minute . I took out a plasti-splint from the medicabinet , bent it to shape , peeled it apart , grasped my little friend under one arm , and pulled straight her injured limb while ignoring the others ' flailing . I secured the two pieces of the splint on either side of her  | h . As the splint grew hack around it to form a plastic sleeve-cast , set her down on the floor and picked up a tranquilizer bulb that , mittedly , I should have administered before I put on the splint. hen I turned back to my friend , I was in time to see that she had cured all her working limbs behind the splint 's collar . With one gesture , she slid the splint off her broken leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature neither of trust nor distrust , but rather of a Completely alternate code for what was mete and un-mete : the splint , which she neither knew , understood , nor even questioned , was simply . . . un-mete . And Rat Korga , in a gesture that brought back to me the grained ky , the chill rocks , and the ribbed and slanted compound walls on a odd I had n't thought about for fourteen standard years , with bunched fingers , slid a ring off one finger . " The face changed . " The heavy features ' disruption brought home my inability to read the expressions on either side of their quiet violence . But because I was human and Rat was human , I assumed the former had been some complacency while the latter some distress . . .. all the things I did n't know that made what I did know what it was , ' Korga repeated . When you said that to me before , I understood it . Now . . . I can remember the words , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . " I think that particular thin bronze circle bore around its inner face the bifurcation circuitry that allowed the stabilization of terms amidst reflexive descriptions . " Rat looked at us . " You have taken away my world . . . ' On the great hand were Mill several more rings that controlled complex hierarchies of metaphorical organization . You have taken away . . . ' Then , in a gesture all of us later agreed communicated urgency , but within which we could find the telltale radicals neither of speed nor intensity by which urgency usually signals itself  --  his movement was slow , deliberate , and still urgent  --  Rat pushed the ring back on . What have you given me ? ' Korga asked . What have you taken away ? ' Looking around the room , Rat took three steps among the support loops , now resting her hare hand on one , with a touch that told how superfluous that support  | was . ( Ynn turned , watching . ) " Ills ... this is not my world . On what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a world at all , ' Marta said . It 's a moon . Of Khyvon . ' Then she frowned , because that pitted face remained unchanged . Chyvon 's a world about sixty million kilometers from yours , that also circles Tyon-omega . ' " To be sure , ' I said , what we call Tyon-omega , Rat calls simply the " sun . " And " moon " ? Let 's just say we 're someplace very far away , Rat . ' " Korga looked at that hand , at the metal bands and their settings , raised those fingers  --  and began to bite at a nail . While Korga chipped and bit and red stones and green stones between the still-wet knuckles glittered to the chipping , those eyes watched us . Biting , Rat spoke  --  and must have heard that the speech was unintelligible with the gnawing ; so stopped biting and spoke again : I had a world . But it is as true to say I never had a world . You have given me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured a word : ... possibility of a world . What world will you give me ? ' The fingers , bent above opals , went back to the teeth  --  big , straight , more ivory than white . Still biting , still chipping , now at the thumb , now at the little finger , Rat came to the ramp at the stage 's edge and started down , leaving dark footprints that dried in seconds on the spongy floor . Was that slow gait menacing ? Did we read menace into it ' ? Korga wandered  --  and in that room , less than five by five meters , that gait , broad-hipped and great-shouldered , as upward lights swung round the drying body , was , itself , to me what wandering was . " Ynn turned , watching . " Marta turned , looking for buttons and pedals that , she must suddenly have realized , Rat was now too far from the emptied tanks for her to use ; she turned back . And watched . " Did Rat read her intent ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know : Whatever you have given me , it does not correct the radical . . . ' Rat paused , tongue struggling with the syllables , missing as many as it caught : . . . radical anxiety termination . It only compensates . This is not like before , on the desert . So you see , now you must give me a world . Or I may take ten , thirty , or a hundred . And then what would you do with me ? ' Rat raised the bare hand now , to gnaw  | again . Knuckles turning , veined ligaments taking shadow and losing it , Rat watched us above shifting joints , stopped beside another flood ight . The ringed hand , fallen to the thigh now , was so still one bloody facet flung its flare up to my eye , unmoving , for five , six , seven breaths . I moved  --  and blood slid to green to white to orange . " Now that their charge had been gone from them for more than a minute , the tubs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had washed and watched Korga , began to autodegrade into their liquid states , flowing along the guiding troughs into the waiting flanges of their red and black hexagonal canisters . And Korga was walking again , toward the high archway to another room with the teaching games , and program-courses , and visualization screens , and educative therapy pads , and mobile environmental simulation units which we 'd hoped would teach some comfortable movement among the cultural patterns of any number of worlds Rat had never known . " Ynn stepped down nervously from the stage . Observation lights withdrew into the floor . Illumination cords , looping about the ceiling , began to adjust color and brightness . " ' Now what could Rat mean , " give me a world " ? ' Marta asked , from where she leaned against the freeform aluminum decorations set out from the wall . " ' Look , ' I said , ' Rat 's only had these language skills for ? ' I glanced at the colored time scale pulsing along the stage 's edge ? ' about three minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks . ' " But we had all seen the glittering stones from among those which , once , had weighted a tyrant 's hand . " Ynn came down the ramp from the arch ; I fell in ; Marta followed . " Hearing our bootheels click the plastiplex , Rat dropped hand from mouth , glanced back at us . ( Rat 's own bare feet were silent . ) ' What world will you give me ? ' then turned back to squat , examining an inset floorheater beneath its plastic grill . " We spent the next days , Marq , trying to find one in which Rat could , with help , fit  --  one that could fit Rat . We decided , Marq . . . finally , on yours . " " My world ? " I asked . " Dyethshome ? Morgre ? " I tried to corner the careening astonishment and it was always just beyond me . " I  | mean , the Fayne-Vyalou ? All the other three hundred geosectors on Velm ' ? " " And in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Rhyonon ? Japril , " I said , and what I felt was the sudden pervasive yet almost unrealizable anger you 'd better be in touch with it you do n't want to ruin three out of four diplomatic missions1 , " what do you . . . what do you think you mean by ? ? " " You 've been an ID over a dozen years , Marq . Perhaps half that time you 've spent on Velm . But the other half you 've spent on any number of dozens of other worlds . So your world ' is a bit more complicated than Dyethshome . Or even Velm . " " But you said ? " " And as far as giving you Rhyonon  --  well , yes , there is a charred and smoking planet whirling about Tyon-omega in an orbit that was Rhyonon 's . Perhaps in a decade or three , when some of the acids have sifted out of that cayenne sky , when some meteorological stability has reasserted itself , the Web may actually reexamine it , give it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout of planoforming , another influx of colonists . But as far as Rhyonon is concerned ? the world of Rhyonon , the complex of information that was that world : well , as you have already heard , Rhyonon no longer exists . " Japril stood up , stepped from her chair , and turned away from me . She joined her hands behind her back . " I said I was going to tell you about your relation to our survivor . " She spoke to the window . " That is what you said . " " The relation 's very simple . " ( Listening to someone speaking towards someplace you 're both facing has always been hard for me . But people have stranger customs than that with which to decorate what they consider important statements . ) " Besides being the single survivor of Rhyonon , Korga happens to be your perfect erotic object ? out to about seven decimal places . " " What ? ? " While I frowned , behind her back Japril moved the fingers of one hand into a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a  | sign , I suddenly remembered , on her world for something highly amusing . " More to the point , " she went on , voice perfectly deadpan , " out to about nine decimal places , you happen to be Rat 's . " Had n't she once told me folks on her world frequently make that sign of amusement without even being conscious of it ? Oh , a diplomat 's life is not an easy one . As Japril turned back , I thought : What a strange thing to hear on an afternoon 's library research session ten thousand light years away from anywhere  --  maybe seven hundred thousand k 's if you happen to think Batria is someplace ; and I 'm sure the odd three-quarters of a billion do . " How do you know what . . . ? " but stopped at the memory : dozens of times in an ID 's life fairly complete synaptic maps are made of the brain ; and such things as Japril spoke of can as easily be read from my maps as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While I sat there , I actually recalled Japril , once when 1 'd told her I found males who bit their nails sexually exciting , asking me just what my ideal sexual type was . Go look it up in your files , I had said most curtly . She had . " It occurs to me , Japril , " I said , wondering why , on top of that anger , I felt so strangely disoriented , " that in one version or another , I 've been hearing references to this Rat Korga over half a galaxy now . Sex is no longer the mystified subject it once was . What you are saying , in a word , is : Rat and myself are sexually attracted to men . Also : Rat and myself both fulfill a number of tricks and turns of physical build , bodily carriage , and behavioral deployment that would make making love with each other not only fun but . . . well , rewarding . Now that 's part of the simple truth ? " " The truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you know it . " " Still ? " I put up a hand , which in this gestural language means " halt , " in that one " full speed ahead , " and , in still another , " I have to go to the bathroom . " " You brought up the idea : as flattering as the concept is , with the universe as large as it is , I ca n't believe I 'm in a unique position . " " The most precursory run through the Web 's most accessible files of women directly or indirectly connected with us ? " " The ones you happen to have the dope on . "  | " ? show that there are some nine hundred eighty-two billion persons who fulfill the erotic preferences of Korga out beyond three decimals . " " Let 's see . That 's short , stocky , hairy , blond , kinky-headed , and male  --  if we 're to judge by me . " " I said we go to a number of decimal places . You 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen billions , in those same files , who would find Korga sexually satisfying to three or more decimal places  --  before you ask , let me tell you : that represents a very small proportion of those whom we 've actually got on record . And , if we ran the same cross-check on the average woman , or male  --  you , for example  --  we would usually expect to come up with about two hundred billion takers delighted to get her . " " And only seventeen billion for Korga ? That 's not your ordinary eroto-star , then . Well , I 've never seen one I 'd cross the street for ? when I 'm somewhere where there are streets . " " So your synaptic mappings suggest . " " You understand , Japril , I spent some of my younger days on some very strange ? " " Spare me . We all did , I suppose . Like you said , your reality is n't privileged either . " " What I want to know about , Japril , is the overlap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persons attracted to Korga ? " " Just in your most accessible files . You said perfect ' and talked decimals . " She regarded me a moment , and I could read nothing in her face . " About twelve million . " " Well . . . I said I was n't unique . Tell me , have you informed all twelve million of us on the list that Prince Charming has just been rescued from a blasted world and that  --  dare anyone do the wake-up routine with a kiss , the chances Korga will melt with reciprocal passion have been computed out to here ? " " The metaphor suggests a cultural reference I may have missed . Nevertheless , there were only two names out of the twelve million that I was acquainted with personally . " " What would we do without quick GI surveys , " I said , not asked . " I 'd never actually met the other person  --  only heard the name .  | ere certainly seemed no reason not to keep this in the family . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " definitely had a lower case " f . " ) Then and there , you know , I got scared . It was a salty fear that brined the saliva at the back of my tongue . And below that , the disorientation . And below that , still , the anger . . . . I took three deep breaths and asked : " Does Rat Korga know as much about me as I know about ? " Well , I did n't see any reason not " him ? " Japril nodded , which means " yes " in one gestural language , " no " in another . She said : " Yes , he does , " and I wondered whether the nod was confirmation or ironic comment . Can I think of ten questions I should have asked ? One : Why does the Web want me to know all this ? Two : How am I supposed to .. . Oh , you fill them in . The one I came up with was : " Who is this other guy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " . . . off on some expedition to another galaxy . . . wo n't be back this lifetime , " or something else maybe , but anyway to that effect . I guess that 's friendship . " All right . . . " Still the anger , still the fear ; and the absence between them which must be where desire lies . " You 've told me that this Rat Korga actually exists ; and you say you 've told Korga I . . . exist ? What . . . happens now ? " " Oh , you 'll walk down a street , on a chance that you 'll meet ; and you 'll meet . . . though , after all this set-up , you 'll know it wo n't be all that much by chance . " " The rhyme suggests a cultural allusion that I 'm not fami ? " " What 's important  --  to you , to Rat , and to the Web  --  is that you will meet . And I think we 've almost reached the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her bobbing chair . " You now have the information we find necessary for you at this time . Would you like a recording of this interview to go over at your leisure ? " " Oh , thanks . No . ... " Full vaurine recordings are expensive . Besides , the particular Yinysh folks with whom I 'd been working recently are one of those cultures where everybody is always offering you everything just to be polite . And to be polite back you 'd better refuse  --  or end up garrotted . " Really , no . It 's not necessary . "  | Japril smiled . " As you like . " And I began rueful years of regretting my idiocy . ( Spiders , and especially Japril , offer very few things just out of politeness ; and as an ID , I am well schooled in what these are likely to be : friendship frequently , sex infrequently , and hyperwave vaurine recordings , broad cast across light-years at tremendous expense , never . ) What came to me then was something both daring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of spiders is to know what is known . But when I said it , I was more aware of the daring : " Japril , what about Cultural Fugue  --  or was it the Xlv ? " She regarded me with one of her more mysterious expressions . ( Were I someone from her world , would that long face with its broad mouth and small eyes be totally clear to me ? ) " Some time ago , you were informed that any GI inquiries after Rhyonon could lead to serious reappraisals of your security status . Well , for now , just consider that extended to cover the Xlv as well , at least as far as you 're concerned . " " Oh , " I said . Have I said ? One thing I hate is anyone telling me what I can or can not know . " It 's like that ? " " In your case . For now . From now on . " Her hand moved toward her pocket  --  for a moment I thought to pull out and wave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began to fade . I stood up with my most diplomatic smile  --  to find myself in a rectilinear garden of me 's  --  up , down , left , right , and diagonal . ( It 's even more unsettling in weak gravity than it is in full . ) I wandered along with , and through , and among a thousand ambling selves , till at last I was walking on yellow pebbles . What do you do with information like that : Somewhere in the known universe is the survivor of a world , possibly destroyed by inscrutable aliens  --  whom you 've been given specific orders not to scrute  --  the information itself blotted out of the Web , yet still trickling along from world to world , star to star . Oh , yes : the two of you just happen to be made for each other . And he wears the rings of Vondramach Tyrannus.  | If you 're as busy a person as an II ) invariably is  --  well , you do n't dwell on it . For very long . Nonstop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-two , in which I got my tiles to Batria and my new job , wrapped neatly up , my thoughts returned to it , oh , perhaps a hundred , maybe a thousand times . Dwelling ? Well , do n't we all live with some such idea anyway : Somewhere in the known universe is the perfect woman for me ? Maybe now I tried to visualize him  --  for that 's what he was , now  --  a little harder than one usually does . You can come up with near perfect that way . But perfect ? At thirty-six years standard you know it ca n't be done . Which I guess is what desire is all about .  | I was back on Velm . Library sojourn and Japril 's message had , like all things , tumbled weeks and light-years into the past . My world ? I had seen the friends I had wanted to see  --  Menek , Santine , F'namara . I had been at Dyethshome long enough to reach that state with parents and siblings where , if one is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly a way as possible , thinking on far pleasures while indulging near comforts . I 'd taken a surface trip to a place , among Velm 's western geosectors : Beresh  --  I 'd only heard it existed weeks before . ( Worlds are big places . ) I had gone to it , had looked at it , had loved it  --  had wrestled with its strange slang , its austere foods , its complex social rhythms . Velm 's world government is bureaucratic anarchy . That 's the plurality governing structure among the six thousand  --  the thirty percent of them that have world governments . Syndicated communism comes next ; then benevolent feudalism  --  which any communist who 's spent time in one will tell us is never all that benevolent ; then oligarchic collectivism ; then industrial fascism ; and by now , we are well over  | I halfway through the seventy percent that do n't have world governments . . . just remember there 's no majority . Bureaucratic anarchy means a socialist world government in which small sections are always reverting to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years standard  --  the longest we 'll allow it to last . Though I 'd been hearing of these enclaves all my life , Beresh was the first on Velm I 'd visited : verticals of blazing blue chalk , bright portable living-rooms lying all over , some clustered together into small court groups of five to fifteen , others stacked maybe two hundred high , next to ersatz elevator towers , from any one of which at any moment a woman or a child might emerge to engage me  --  lurking about in my tourist reds  --  in bargaining for some part of my travel credit , for which they would perform in return i bizarre and fascinating services . Then the trip home : fourteen hours by ten-propeller flying platform ; another six by monorail . Home . And we remember what a complicated . I checked to see if my baggage was properly tagged with the little green disks that would conduct it through the interlevels and on , then loped off the rickety old rollerwalk , crossed the broken blue bricks of Water-Alley , and sauntered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet of the Butcher 's Union . Inside , high on the shelves , behind copper webbing , racks of cloned flesh thrust pink and red through the hooking rings . Longpig over there , shortpig  --  our term for the native flesh  --  in front of me and on the far wall , a host of more exotic insect , lizard , and worm meats . Prime cultures , says Si'id , who supervises , the kids working2 this shop as well as the next outlet down ; she 'd go on for hours about the various pedigrees and provenances if you let her . I never go into a butcher outlet anywhere on Velm , or anywhere else for that matter , no matter the geosector , without recalling the first time , during my fifth trip offworld , that I was dining with my employer and her spouses for my third job . ( The feathers on  | everything ; the very unsubtle music . ) I was charmed when they served the meal on narrow plates , about three inches wide , curved around in a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  cunning I thought  --  eating with your fingers ; though getting the tastes and smells so confused with one another would never go at home . There was the meat ; and I began to tell them about the butcher outlets on Velm , and just what the cloned longpig I 'd been raised on was , realizing as I spoke they were a little shocked . I picked up my own bit of roast , bit down  --  something hard was in it ... . Then I realized : Bone ! This meat had once been walking around with a skeleton inside . Although I did n't , many times when I 've told the story , I 've said I left the table . Inside , the stained-glass skylight lay reds and greens over the chipped stone flooring . Three other women waited with their director disks ready in claw ( or hand ) , while the little human redhead who 'd been working2 here as an apprentice for a standard year now , swung and slashed with her broad bright knife ; and the two other apprentices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , another human , with long tanned arms , the other , evelm , with gold claws on tufted greenscaled ones , tossed the packages into a clinking chain net that carried them out through the sphincter flange . Minutes later , I 'd sent a kilo and a half of flesh , tagged with a green disk , on ahead of me . ( Shoshana had said : " Marq , if you 're going to come home unexpectedly , could n't you at least see about your own food ? " So I was going to see about several of the folks ' today . ) I was out the door again , through the gate , and onto the roller walkway  --  clink , clank , clunk , halt , bounce , go again . Blue noonsky between the platforms of the two above-ground park-levels , like the scraps of dark blue cloth we cut up as kids to make patchwork maps of imaginary counties , clear and smokeless . Then overhead platforms pulled away . From the rollerwalk rail I watched pale cactuses drifting on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my left ; we came around the cliff edge , to see the falls broiling on the rocks , and there beside it , its three free-standing multichrome walls rising two hundred meters each behind it , the black and silver pile : Dyethshome.  | I stepped off onto yellow sand , walked through a break in the lurid growth , and turned onto the variegated clay . Stone steps led up to the terrace flags  --  the same green stone fronting most of the older manufacturing communes all around the city . Three of my siblings were playing in the pool by the rocks that turn white down near the water . Spray splattered the olive flags . Tinjo flopped Bucephalus , splosh ! Bucephalus wagged her scaled tail , sheeting out meters of droplets . Small Maxa jumped up and down at the pool edge , afroth to her chest . Tinjo saw me  --  or Bucephalus smelled me ; Tinjo squealed and the same moment Bucephalus was out of the pool and up by the carved railing on all sixes , shaking her scaly head  --  Large Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's children , human or evelm . Bu lollopped across the stones , the wet tufts on her legs dripping about her claws , the scales on her back a glister of purples and browns . She leaped against me , bronze claws hooked over my shoulders ( yes , the gold-clawed apprentice in the butcher shop hails from a different continent than Bu ) , small tongues playing over my mouth . I opened wide , so she could be sure to taste me properly . Her eyelids signaled madly the sign we had both agreed on , when we were fifteen years younger  --  me sixteen and just emerging from human adolescence , she fifteen and just emerging from evelm infanthood  --  would be my name to her : Marq Dyeth , I read . Marq Dyeth , Marq Dyeth ( I blinked back Bucephalus Dyeth for all I was worth ) , while with her nether tongue , the one below the three she was tasting inside my mouth with , she was saying in that slow-motion basso : " Marq , you 're back ! Where have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many stars you 've swallowed since I last saw you ? How many worlds have you chewed up and spit out ? " which started me laughing , since I 'd only been gone for three days two thousand kilometers to the oest-east . I almost bit my ( and her ) tongue . Then Tinjo , all of ten years old , was shoving Bu aside and , holding my shoulders , jumped naked and wet against me . And , of  | course , nothing would do her but to lick my face too . " All right . Tinjo , " I said . " From you it 's just sloppy . " " Well , I got your meat , " she said . " And took your bags inside . " Where she had them on her , I do n't know , since she was stark naked ; but she held up her wet hand , in which were my green identidisks that had dragged my parcels home . " You 're a love . " I licked her wet hair . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh , and her face was burned darker than dragon 's urine by our white sun , all around her black eyes and watered lashes . I pocketed my disks . Then Small Maxa , who is an albino and will not tan  --  they had to do something to her skin to keep her from burning and insert darkening lenses behind her livid irises  --  stepped up in front of me . I bent down , and very seriously she mimed licking my face . Something is wrong with her . She hates to be touched . But at twelve , she wants to do what everybody else does . " Hello , Marq . " She grinned hugely , creasing her white face like an old human 's . " I 've been building a toy mine that I want you to come see ; I love you . " Then she held out her hand to me and I held out mine  --  about an inch away from hers . We made motions of shaking . Some of us think she might be crazy in some serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucephalus were tearing off after each other around the terrace again , now down the steps , now into the water , now up the rocks . " I 'll come and see your mine after I 've gone to my room a while . And do you want to see some vaurine recordings of where I 've been ? " " I love you . Yes , Marq . " She dropped her eyes ; her hands made small ivory fists at her hips  --  which I always thought meant she wanted to hold you but did n't dare because the contact would be too unpleasant . " I 'll see you in a while . " I put my hand about an inch from her cheek and mimed petting . Still grinning , she blinked , saying nothing by it , save some obscure physiological comment on our dark blue sky , our wide white sun .  | I turned away and walked through immense silver petals , blooming around me in the black wall , turning red . Inside , the crystal pillar by the door disappeared top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( my mother the biogeneticists , evelm ) sat on her perch , where she usually does these days , blinking about the hall with quiet , gilded eyes , her gorgeous wings folded about herself , their polychrome membranes rustling in the draught from the high grate to the south court . Egri ( my mother the industrial diplomats , retired , human ) squatted beside Max , forearms about her knees , her toenails slightly yellow , her biceps sinewy , her long hair  --  slightly yellow  --  thinning over her freckled scalp . A childhood memory of the two of them , engaged in endless discussions in three languages about the complexities of the world and interworld information field , its signifying ramifications , its semiotic specifications . Now they just sit together , keeping each other company , looking up at the balcony platforms across the hall , down through the transparent stretches of flooring at the ball courts below , out at the rest of us . Lurking there in the entrance hall  --  which is the way evelmi from Maxa 's part of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always struck me as probably a little daunting to most visitors . But they like it . " Marq ? " Shoshana ( my mother the architectural consultants , human ) came up from the spiral stair through the star pattern in silver set in the maroon clay . It represents an astronomical cluster , called Mu-3 , visible in the skies from Velm 's northern hemisphere but not , unfortunately , from Morgre . " Glad you 're back . " Shoshana has hair like a salted helmet . " Lights were blinking on the console downstairs . Two students just arrived in the south wing . " Shoshana 's knuckles are silver berries , ripe and wrinkling in her sixty-eighth year ; her hand , over the black globe that was both newel-nob and clock , half obscured the time . In the dark glass the time in Morgre , the Zevia-ncomplex a third of the way west round Velm , and Katour , one of the three largest complexes in our world , way off in the north , glimmered in  --  respectively  --  brazen , emerald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I called myself rushing to get back here so I 'd have some time to myself . " Regularly , groups of  | students come to study at Dyethshome , for which , over the last three generations , we have provided the south court . Orienting them isyes  --  my job while I 'm here . " I suppose I have to get to it , then . " " I know you want to go to your room and rest , Marq , " Large Maxa rumbled , showing a splinter of her wings ' scarlet lining . When I was five and six , she would reward our good behavior by unfurling them over us while we hissed our delight . " You see to them , make them comfortable . " " Sure , Maxa . " Egri blinked , sighed , and really looked more like an evelm than Maxa  --  which Egri claims is what fifty-four years as an ID , will do to you . " I 'll get them set up , Shoshana . Then , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in when the others get here . " Have you noticed ? Whenever you come home , your folks always find something for you to do within the first three minutes . I trotted over the reliefs at the foot of the ramp circling above the spillway . We only flood it for parties . The carvings along the spill bottom , done by and of the native evelmi  --  well before any evelmi married into the Dyeths , or even before there were many evelmi in M-81 ; only dragons  --  have always been my favorite . Large Maxa , Kal'k , Sel'v , and N'yn , my evelm parents , were always a bit condescending toward the human kids ' delight in them . For one thing , as far as carvings go , they do n't taste like anything . And N'yn and Sel'v once took all of us , when I was thirteen , on a trip to the R'Rtour-wr , way up north , to see the cliff carvings there , where evelmi live in a squalor and violence which , though I 'd heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had never seen before . Licking those slime-covered stones to taste the cinnamon and sandalwood  --  neither human scent really covers the evelmi palate ? beneath that dribbling mucus ... As I reached the ramp 's crest , I peeled away my tourist reds and got most of them on the suspensor hooks at the first toss . They pulleyed off to be cleaned and folded away . Catwalks circled off toward the balconies . The ramp ended in a flowering of mirrors . I walked into them .  | Mirrors swung back and up and out and down ; I stepped under the irregular stone arch , traced with emerald guano . ( I 've mentioned the pearlbats . . . ? ) High Iiriani behind one of the towering multichromes flung parti-colored dapplings down through the transparencies and over the amphitheater 's tiered stones . Low Iiriani-prime was a diamond at the edge of one of the others  --  did it lend enough light to pale those hues ? I could hear the falls , but all I could see from here were a few fountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the cracked steps , squinting up among the theater seats ' ninety rows . Each month 's student load is about twenty-five . It can be as low as twelve ; it can be as high as thirty . They come to study the art ( endless ) , the architecture ( exemplary ) , the history ( frequently embarrassing ) , or the technology ( extensive ) of Dyethshome  --  sometimes some combination or interface . They usually arrive in the late afternoon on the north monoline spur , which takes longer but does n't go through Morgre proper ; lets them off within sight of the rear grounds  --  except during hotwind season , when we have someone meet them at the central station and take them here by an underground route . When I come in to meet them , they 're inevitably scattered up around the top ten tiers . I call them down , and after an hour 's orientation , during which I tell them about where they 'll stay in the six stories of galleries , tunnels , halls , corridors , ramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subterranean part of the south court , discuss study aids , research guides , and various ways to get into town , tell them where they can cook , eat , wash , and shit , describe the more and less interesting runs for sex through Morgre , note the public parks offering the most joyous and the most somber dancing , the pools around which the conversation is the most and the least subtle , we 're usually all on a first-name basis and fairly happy . At the foot of the stairs I stepped over the grate ; below it water glimmered . Barefoot and naked , I wandered onto the middle of the skene .  | Despite Shoshana 's lights , the amphitheater was empty . Trying to make sure I had n't overlooked someone sitting or standing in the very top row , I walked to a side aisle , stepped on the bottom stair , and ran the service number through my mind three times  --  before I realized I had it wrong . I corrected it  --  and the right side of the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up . I looked about the falling rows , left and right . Still no one . Passing tier forty-four , I glanced over at the entrance corridor . The light above it was out , which meant no one was still down inside . The globes along its ceiling , as well as the blue lights at both ends , turn on when you enter and off when you leave . I looked back down over the seats , over the rounded roofs of the oest court , across the upper parks of Morgre , to the pitted crust of the Vyalou . Here and there , purple patches were all wound through to the orange east by the fuming Hyte . ( Amphitheater : half-theater . The other half should always be kilometers of calm sublimity . ) When I reached the seventieth or so tier , I stepped off and started walking behind the backs of the seats . At the next aisle , I did n't bother to start the escalator . I just walked down . I was thinking of calling out , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own hesitancy . In the center of the twenty-first row is the polarized chamber ? built with the amphitheater for those people who wanted to see the performance or the landscape but who did not want to be seen seeing . Invisible from the outside , it appears only as the smallest gap between the row 's two center seats , perhaps an inch wider than the space between the others . It deflects light and sound around it , so that two people can sit in those two " center " chairs and hold a whispered conversation with each other and never realize that they are some twelve feet apart . The only thing that does n't work is leaning to touch your friend 's hand . Our great joke as children was to have our friends count the seats in that row : though they seem to correspond seat for seat with the row behind and the row before , the count always comes out to ten short , which , after you 've counted the three tiers five or six times to check , tends to unnerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently done their GI homework pretty thoroughly and know of nooks and crannies in this place even I 've forgotten .  | Just to check , I walked over to the place where I could see nothing hut seats and stepped inside . She stood up from one of the high-backed chairs . " Marq Dyeth ... ? " He remained cross-legged on the cushioned bench , watching me . And did not blink . " Nea . . . ? " I said . " Nea Thant ! What in the worlds brings you here ? " Through ornate ceiling panes , Iirianilight , twice colored , caught in the crevice between white gem and silver setting above his thumb 's deeply ridged knuckle . He breathed ; and the glare detonated at my right eye 's inner corner . I swayed back a little . Perhaps my eyes narrowed . But I did n't blink . " Hello , Marq ! " Nea held out a hand , gloved in red foil . ( I took it . ) " This month I 'm one of your students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a chance to say hello , to talk ? " Beneath the line of a roof tessellation 's shadow , lopsided like a mask , his eyes were black holes out of whose eerie absences he looked at me from under rumpled brows . For all Japril 's explanations , I could only think : But why here . . . ? " Marq Dyeth , I had to come ! " Nea said , with the growling intensity you should reserve for statements made just before committing murder , but which the Thants used to underline a tenth the things they say . " I had to talk to somebody . . . somebody who would understand . I flew here . I flew across sixteen thousand light-years , alone and terrified , to tell you . It 's about ?

But it 's a world with many problems among its impoverished lowlands . " He put one great bare foot down on the stone flooring . He leaned forward to put his elbows on the frayed knees of his canvas pants : unhemmed at waist and cuff , belted with some ornamental chain , they and his rings were all he wore . The big hands , one naked , one weighted with metal and stone , hung between his knees from heavy wrists .  | " " there 's been talk , in many of Nepiy 's geosectors , of the possihil ity of Cultural Fugue , " Nea went on . " Just recently fifty-two of its hundred-seventy-nine geosectors voted to call in the Family to reconstruct some of its social functions in a less volatile form . Of course there 's some opposition from some of the lower lowland areas more oriented toward the Sygn . But the Family has approached Thadeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for all of Nepiy ! " She caught her breath . He breathed . " You mean they want you to become Focus Family for an entire world ? For Nepiy ? " I tried to remember what I could of that strange form of rule by celebrity , by media , by notoriety . " Does Thadeus want to move from one world to another ? Do you all want to be bothered with all that publicity and attention ? " I remembered to breathe . Again . " Thadeus thinks it would be exciting . Eulalia wants to do whatever Thad wants . And Clearwater does n't care , which amounts to the same thing . Thadeus says it 's our duty ; she says it would be exciting . She says when a whole world calls to you in need , you must put aside personal considerations and rise to the occasion . We would be virtually the most important . . . " she paused . . . " important family on the entire world . Its rulers , for all practical purposes . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were several visits by Focus Units from various worlds . In the time of Vondramach . So I 've come here to study them  --  and yes , I know the study is all pretense . I just want to talk to someone who knows something about interworld relations . " And I thought : How could his fingers , even that big , hold so many rings ? Three iron ones : four bigger ones of bronze ; some were narrow and copper ; three , of pale gold , on different fingers , were set with shards of different jades , two , on the same , of bright aluminum , with both agates and opals ; the platinum one on his thumb was cast in a shape very like one of our local dragon 's heads , big as a dyll nut and gnawing a mistrock as big . " Zetzor is a very different world from Velm , Marq . And Nepiy is different from them both . But one thing that Zetzor and Velm share  --  at least your part of it and my part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sygn . We have never been seriously religious any more than you have . But to be asked suddenly to adopt a religion that , in a sense , we 've never really known ; to be asked , suddenly , to abandon one world for another , to leave our home ? " A nervous motion took her a step to the side  --  in front of him . And I think I actually saw her for the first time , while he became only a brown canvas knee , creased and with a worn spot , the brown curve of a shoulder , reddened further from the ceiling panes , visible at her side , all equally and confusingly astonishing . She looked down at the loose flags , pushed at one with her baggy boot 's soft leather . " I love the " fhants , Marq . And I 'm terrified for us . I 'm terrified that Thadeus will get her way . And I 'm just as terrified that she wo n't . " " Nea . . . ? " I said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the right . " Look , maybe we should go inside and talk to Egri about this . " I think there was a slight ringing in my ears . Low in my abdomen it was as if a bubble had suddenly blown up to push all my organs around into uncomfortable positions . I mean , what do you do when you first see your perfect erotic object and have been assured , by unimpeachable sources , that the perfection is mutual ? ( The one thing I can vouch for ; I never had the slightest question who he was . ) " Come on , Nea , " I said . " Let 's get out of here ! " With neither nod nor smile , and my ears and knees heating with diplomatic embarrassment , I fled the chamber . Nea came after me . ( Did she look back at her companion and excuse herself ? I did n't hear . I did n't see . ) She caught up to me when we were halfway down to the skene . ( And from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . ) As we stepped out onto the amphitheater stage , me naked and her in leather and foil , I think I was about to turn around and rush back , when Nea said , in a funny kind of voice : " What a strange one , Marq . . . ! I could tell you felt it too ! " " Nea , " I asked , and felt like a fool for it , for somehow with all I knew , I did n't know at all : " Who is . . . ? " 1 began but was afraid to place before her the pronoun that would place me with . . . him . " She is rather odd , " Nea said , confirming what , I was unsure . " She 's just another one of your students  --  at least I assume so . We got to talking on the monoline down . In the whole trip , I did n't manage to get her name . But I gather she 's from very far away . "  | Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cracked steps , she gave a great sigh , and I could almost hear her thoughts travel thousands of light-years off . We reached the top of the stair , beneath hanging green . Mirrored blades swung in and out at us . And missed . " Max ! Shoshana ! " I called from the ramphead . " Egri ! Guess who 's with us this month . " I came around the walkway , the bright fan-blades flashing behind grills in the high walls . I glanced to the side , waiting for her to catch up to me  --  so I could take her arm , I realized ; which is what I would have done with any human or evelm from this particular locality . But polar Zetzor is not Velm 's M-81 . I slew the impulse . " Nea has something she wants to talk to you about . " As we came to the bottom of the ramp , Nea held out both hands , red foil , right ; green , left . " Max , Shoshana ... " Shoshana stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nea ? How have you been ! What in the worlds are you here for ? It 's wonderful to see you . But ? " " Are your parents here ? " Large Maxa rumbled affably from her perch . " It would be just like the lot of you to leap stars and not a word to anyone that you were arriving ! You should have let us know ? " " It 's just me , Max . " Nea laughed . " And I almost had to break laws to get here . I 'm officially enrolled as a student . But the real reason I 've come is for advice . " " You came all the way from Zetzor , by yourself  --  for advice ? " Shoshana 's smile was disbelieving . " Really , the way you people flit from world to world  --  like gnats from one side of the Hyte to the other . " She put her hand on Nea 's epaulet . I saw Nea start to pull away , then remember she was not on Zetzor . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 17 ? Endless horseplay of a distressing violence and stylization , laced with scabrously affectionate invectives , in which no two people ever touch . I 'm diplomat enough to know it 's a distortion , but it 's a distortion of something there . ) " I 've visited fifty worlds by vaurine projection ? " which is how most of us satisfy  | our tourist urge ? " and two in vivo , when Egri took us to Kensitty . But , " Shoshana declared , " I will never understand unlimited space-fare ! " " Neither do most of the shipping officials in the Zetzor northquadrant spaceport . Otherwise I would n't be here . " Nea stepped ; sway from Shoshana , and looked up at the perch . " Egri , I thought maybe you could help me . I mean you 've traveled from world to world and know the problems that occur between them . Thadeus thinks there 's an opportunity to go to Nepiy as the Nepiy Focus Family . But it would mean . .. " I went over and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carving from some far north geosector ( anchored three ways to the tolgoth planking by antique , black , flat-link chains ) , looked attentive , and did not listen as Nea retold with more detail and less clarity what she had outlined to me in the amphitheatre . The strange things about perfect erotic objects ( when perfection is out to that many decimals ) : though you can remember dozens of details about them  --  a backlit ear clawed with rough hair , casting shadow on a pitted jaw ; the wrinkle of a vein beneath thin skin lying over the ligaments fanning to pronounced toe knuckles ; the wide lozenge of a thumbnail gnawed back from the callused crown , a knuckle below bright metal and brighter stone  --  still , you can never remember the woman ; that is , you can never remember your sense of the woman as a self ; at least not the way you can with any number of friends , acquaintances , or even some stranger , say , glimpsed frowning down at a gaming machine as you pass the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeses on the transport skid halted on a ramp from the lower level , or even some Web official with a mound of authorization stamps on the desk before , and a bank of check-out lights glittering behind , now half a galaxy away . Someone once pointed out to me that there are two kinds of memory ( I do n't mean short- and long-term , either ) : recognition memory and reconstruction memory . The second is what artists train ; and most of us live off the first  --  though even if we 're not artists we have enough of the second to get us through the normal run of imaginings . Well , your perfect erotic object remains only in recognition memory ; and his absolute absence from reconstruction memory becomes the yearning that is , finally , desire . That socially surrounded absence , when  | you 're young , masks a lot of things in the real world ; when you 're older and a few thousand sexual encounters have begun to clear what desire is about ( or perhaps what really lies about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges , its effect is not so much that of an obliterator any more as it is that of a distorting lens . If you can smile at what you see through , it 's sometimes illuminating . That was the distortion I was experiencing now , so that when Nea suddenly exclaimed : " . . . but things happen on Nepiy that ca n't happen here ! You ca n't imagine how different that world is from Zetzor ! " ? what I saw was not the cities blasted into the shadowy walls of the canyons that worm the polar plates of Zetzor ( its equatorial regions clotted with lichen jungles , fused deserts , and fuming bismuth swamps that make the - wrs of Velm seem like ancient carburetor leakings ) ; what I envisioned was a scape of silicate sand , airs darkened to dim gold by dusts too hot to bear ; and through kilometer after kilometer of umbrial dunes , the only irregularity beyond the grit rush was one shadow , barely human , stalking away . I imagined it ; and thrilled to my imaginings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of the alien , it comprised the simplest recombination of the familiar : the hotwinds that ravage for three months across Velm 's own southern temperate zones transposed to Velm 's own north-polar wastes . " Well , you were right to be upset ! " Shoshana announced at my side . " The Family/Sygn conflict is in the process of creating a schism throughout the entire galaxy , concerning just what exactly a woman is . And it may mean that instead of one universe with six thousand worlds in it , we will have a universe with one group of some thousands of worlds and another group of some thousands of others , and no connection between the two save memories of murder , starvation , and violence . And in a situation like that , no , you do not just simply decide to up and change sides ! Even to become a . . . Focus unit ! " " Not just a Focus unit , " Large Maxa said gently . " A Focus Family . " " It 's the fame , " Nea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her hips . " Honestly , it is . A standard year ago , now , when we last visited a world called Ulus , we passed through a geosector called  | Ajegit and stopped at a city named Skesss . Among the white roads that wind the twelfth and thirteenth above-ground levels  --  Ajegit 's bedrock is too hard to have underground stages as you do here  --  there was a major traffic artery , with shops and public art works , called Dyeth 's Row , named after your seven-times-great grandmother . Thadeus made sure from GI ; and we all went to see it . " " My dear , " Large Maxa said , letting her green and glimmering head lean to the side , her gold eyelids sweeping across her onyx eyes , and some of her tongues a-twitter beneath the bony arch of her upper jaw , " there are half a dozen streets called Dyeth 's Row scattered about the various urban complexes all over Velm . No doubt there are another fifty scattered about the cities of other worlds . Mother Dyeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and others . There was much pomp , much ceremony . Streets , parks , and concourses were named after various heroes in the Vondramach entourage . But that means nothing now . None of us have ever walked down more than one or two of them . Nor is there any reason why we should want to . And besides , to share a name with fifty or a hundred-fifty streets out of the hundred billion streets among a hundred million cities , most on worlds not ours , is not fame . What could it mean , to us or anyone ? " " It meant something to Thadeus . And Clearwater ; and Eulalia too . " Nea looked first at one of us , then at the other . Her skin was the ashy brown of a woman pigmented dark by heredity who has lived most of her life on a cold world at a pole turned eternally from its sun . " They very much wanted us to see it  --  that 's why they took us there in the first place . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew you . . . . A Focus Family becomes a model unit for the women for an entire world . We would have streets and parks named for us . . . at least on Nepiy . " " It 's to be expected ? " Maxa boomed in her languid bass , though she had begun to flex the muscles that moved the spurs on the back of her hind claws ; I wondered if Nea knew her well enough to recognize it for a kind of nervousness . ( Though on most evelmi from the Fayne it indicates intense joy . ) A second tongue took up " ? on a world that received a touring entourage of Vondramach 's a whole seven ripples ago . It means nothing today . " " Magma ! " Nea declared , turning again . " It meant something to  | me , Max ! Egri , Mary , you 've traveled between worlds more than I have , unlimited fare or not . You mean to tell me that on this world or another you 've never gone to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I have n't and was going to say so . But Egri said : " Yes . I have . " " And did n't it mean something to you ? " Nea looked like she might cry . Egri kneaded a bony elbow with her knobby fingers . When she spoke , it was even slower than Max . " The point is , I think , that what it meant to me was very different from what it meant to Thadeus . Or to you . " Maxa gave that thunderous hiccup that passes for an evelm humph ! " Just up and changing sides like this , it makes me think they 've been part of the Family all along . " She began to step around on the other little platforms that made up the rest of the perch , though her voice went on in its low , leisurely roar . " That kind of irresponsibility is a Family characteristic . " " Fiddle , " Shoshana said . Her job for the last year or so has been in an electronic instrument adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very old term , whose origins no one is sure of , which means making small adjustments that are nevertheless absolutely necessary ? though it seems to be connected somehow with some very ancient music . " Nea , I understand how upset you must be . And I 'm even moved that you came all this way to talk about it . Simply because it 's as serious as it is , we just ca n't make assumptions like that , Max . Zetzor , Ulus , Nepiy , all of them are very far away . We do n't really know anything about them  --  and no , " because Nea had raised one fist up to her shoulder , not in anger but in frustration . Still , Shoshana knew how easily Thants can take offense , even if it never lasts more than a month . " I 'm not saying the tastes of any of your words suggest spoiled ingredients . I am simply saying that no meal yields up all its flavors at the first bite . Without contradicting a thing you 've told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . We have n't talked to Thadeus . We have n't talked to Eulalia . " " Do you think I 've been able to talk to them either ? Not to mention Clearwater . I mean really talk to them ? I know what they want , what they 've said , and . . . some of the things they 've done to  | get it . It makes me very frightened . Shoshana , Max , I do n't know what to do ! " Her last sentence was softer and shriller than the ones before . It 's so easy to lose the nature of the distress when dealing with the crisis of people from another culture , much less another whole matrix of cultures  --  which is what a person from another world always is . " If Thadeus , Clearwater , and Eulalia do go off to Nepiy , what about the rest of us ? Should we go with them , with some hope of sabotaging ? " " Certainly not , " Egri said . " You 'd be guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pearlbat 's wing . " Still squatting she put one foot down on the next inlaid platform , toes curling on the ornamental side . " Or should we stay where we are , working on the Family 's side to change their ? " Egri simply laughed , flexing the toes of both feet . " Soon you will have things too complicated for anyone to follow . No , let 's try something more straightforward , more in touch with what you feel . " " But I do n't know what I feel ! " Nea declared . " I 'm frightened ! I 'm confused . How am Ito know what ? " " Are you hungry ? " Egri asked . " Are you sad ? " " I do n't . . . " and here Nea gave a little shudder , her fists and her lips held tightly . ( I have been told that children , in the livable climes of Zetzor , are quickly taught not to cry : stoicism is a great virtue there and is expressed in all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she repeated . " I ca n't ... " Then , beside Mother Dyeth 's silent personality column , light turned riotous in the entrance mirrors ; mirrors swung in . Bucephalus came lolloping inside , turned , and took the stance of an evelm dragon hunter many years older than she . On the other side of the door , Tinjo ( who is a love , but also a bit of a coward ) peered around the edge . Small Maxa ran up to stand right by the jamb . Bronze head , bronze feet , bronze hands , bronze torso bright with liriani outside : heaving up a brazen forearm , George Thant shoved Small Maxa across the chest back against the multiple hinges and strode through , going from bright to umber . " There ! You are there ! Nea Thant ! Thant ! Nea ! Thant ! . . . " ( Have I explained how the folk  | of northern Zetzor use the order of your names to render crushing insults both to intimates and strangers ? Oh , never mind . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ! But you are as a drop of yellow poison in the clear currents of our Family 's love ! "  | " You have come here to betray your kin to the viper and the ant . You have disgraced your ancestors and your progeny . Your treachery has shamed me , hurt me , confused me , and I would weep tears of hot vinegar if I could ! " ( Stamp , stamp , stamp  --  a reference , I believe , to a curse contained in an oral epic from equatorial Zetzor which , for the last few decades , had been popular at the poles . ) " You have squandered ice and soil , jeopardizing the entire custom of unlimited space fare , won for you by the work of your illustrious father , Thant Thadeus ? " ( You can also proffer resounding compliments that way too. ) " ? and your melodiously sung mother , Thant Eulalia . As you know , and that knowledge must be your shame , unlimited space fare is limited only to those uses which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusing it , it can be rescinded at any moment ! " ( Stamp , stamp , stamp , stamp , stamp  --  five stamps , I think , was an allusion to some parodic use a Zetzorian academic poet of the south had made of that equatorial epic . ) " You have besmirched two parents ' joy at your birth and deepened the memory of pain your bodily mother , Thant Clearwater , still bears from her womb-work . Four siblings ' shouts of laughter and cries of pleasure have stilled in  | ! a night of fire and chagrin . Oh , Nea ? " ( Stamp ; which I guess was just George ? ) " What did you call yourself doing , coming here like this ? Now I am burdened with hauling you back . Thadeus commands it . Who knows what crazed notions you 've left with our friends , the glaucomas and retinitises and cataracts with which you 've infected their eyes so that whenever they gaze again in our direction , all their vision will be obscured by disease . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamping like some brass engine whose proper use no one can divine but which is nevertheless clearly malfunctioning . Nea opened her mouth , then closed it and her eyes . She opened her eyes , her expression for a moment nearing rage  --  once she actually got out a " No . . . ! " She closed her eyes again , touched two foil fingers to her dark forehead , and shivered . " . . . spawn of a sewage pump , descendant of a slime mold , all genetic congruences we share are discredited by your infamy and actions . How could you , female son of Thant ! See how I wring my hands and wring my hands once more , till the flesh goes raw on my palms . I have searched swamp , dry-plain , and canyon for appropriate execrations , and have yet found none for the nuance of my distress ... " Shoshana and I glanced at each other . Years ago , along with fill V'vish , Kelso , and Alyxander , we had taken a vaurine-projection tour of Zetzor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably saw more of it than any of us ever will , " was Thadeus 's curt comment , on their next visit when we began to ask what we thought were polite questions . But while we were touring the everlight south , we had gone to a theater in the well-touristed city of K and seen an evening of energetic satire in the public theater about the northern Zetzori . ( Not that the southerners are n't strange . ) One particular skit concerned a northern mother , from a Family enclave , going after a runaway child ; it was n't unlimited space-fare that was in jeopardy that time but some local county tax-rebate the youngster 's presence in the mother 's labor cooperative assured . Still , the gestures , phrases , even the stamps were practically the same . And there was George , from north Zetzor 's 17 , raving on and acting like a South Zetzorian parody of herself . It was funny and scary . By now some of my other parents  --  Jayne ( who is human ) , Kal'k ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hirum ( another human ) , and Hatti ( human ) , and finally my sisters Alyxander and Black Lars ( one  | human , one evelm ; both IDs like me ) ? had come up on their various lifts to watch , quietly and wonderingly , at the scene taking place in our west court vestibule . " I do not know my actions , " cried George , " yet what I have done and must do is lit by the reflections of starlight-gathering mirrors along the thousand-kilometer glacial fields . " She marched back toward the door , then stalked forward again , stepped to the side ( stamp , stamp ) , then back . " I do not know my feelings , yet the feelings I have already anent this matter , as well as the feelings I know are to come , wrack me as lava from Kromhatch Kone shatters frozen scalings collected on the south face . Oh , Nea ? " She seized her sister 's shoulder and pulled her toward the entrance ? " let 's go ! " The doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George dragged Nea stumbling out across the patio . Small Maxa , as the shimmering plates swung in , crouched in the doorway and began to cry . Large Maxa swayed , platform by platform , down from her perch , her wings showing now and again their inner scarlet . First Jayne , then Black Lars , next Hirum moved to Small Maxa . The earlier shove t from George she had taken fairly well . But she knew the Zetzori 's aversion to contact . When George had grabbed Nea 's shoulder , her reserves had broken . She squatted in the doorway and sobbed . One , and another , we went to my crouching white sister , stooped to pat at ( but not touch ) the ivory fists bunched on her bony chest , to lick at ( but not touch ) her lightly veined ears , to rub at ( but not touch ) her knobby human back . " Marq Dyeth . . . ? " I stood , surprised . At the top of the ramp , he had one hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oddly , hollowed by the height ; and grossly accented . He said : " Your students are here now . . . many of us . " And I knew somehow he had not come in to tell me that . Knowing it , I also knew he 'd been standing there a while  --  though how much he 'd seen of George 's and Nea 's altercation I did n't know . " Yes , " I said . " Thank you . Of course . " I knew too his choosing to speak then was absolutely not what it would have been from me : the discreet throat clearing , the diplomatic cough , the reminder to people caught up in a private moment that they are , in fact , observed .  | I cast apologetic looks about me . Only gold-clawed V'vish and bushy-haired Hirum caught them ; they glanced at the stranger on the ramp , glanced back at me . I hurried across the vestibule and started up . He stood just in front of the reflecting south court doors , not waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . As I reached the ramp 's crest , he turned , and , with movements that ( however awkwardly they nudged his wide shoulders , tilted his pelvic blades whose wings jutted above his raveling pants-waist ) were completely familiar , he went through the swinging mirrors in the same motion with which , minutes ago , I had fled the polarized chamber . As I neared the doors , the panels ' silver gave me back , waving , only the thickset little male whose swagger is just a bit too much for any real elegance  --  but with the wreckage of a joy between short beard and heavy brows which , even seconds come to pieces , transformed what should have been the most familiar of faces : when the mirrors swung aside for me , I was not sure who walked out under the stone arch ( he was gone . . . ! ) , who walked down the steps , stepped wide of the grill , gamboled out onto the amphitheater skene , for I felt as though I were no longer who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished . . . ? They were there  --  scattered up around the top ten tiers . I looked around the empty seats far longer than I usually do . ( He could have gotten back to the chamber . . . ? ) Finally I said : " Good afternoon . I see most of you have gotten here . My name is Marq Dyeth .. .. " ( Thinking : Why am I telling them ? He knows . ) " We 'll be talking together about an hour , maybe two , possibly more , to orient you and answer your questions . But first why do n't you all come down from your perches to the front rows here where we can make out each other 's faces . Yes , that 's it . Come on , now . I wo n't urinate on you . " ( Suffice that it 's an evelmism and would take a page and a half to explain fully . But they laughed , which was the important thing ; and began to gather up their readers , recorders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll start the moving stair . . . . " on which , among them , he did not come down .  | I 'm tempted to give you an account of the whole three-hour orientation session2 ( they do go on ) , if only because I know now that from his hiding place , he saw it all . I 'm also tempted to omit it entirely  --  as I want to omit from thought all moments when he was not available to my sight , my tongue , my hand . But the truth is it was a student orientation session2 like any hundred others . There was the bigshouldered , short-tongued algae farmer , from even further south  --  an embarrassingly healthy creature who smiled at everything and took down everything on a portable notator that wept an endless curl of paper into her scaly lap . Every minute or so she would wind it rapidly on another little red plastic spool , tear it off , and push it into another of the numberless pouches on her long vest . ( " And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , with us this morning ... ? " There were three , would n't you know : one from Ly'el Complex a few dozen kilometers away ; two others from some geosector on the other side of I this world . ) There were the four evelmi with steel-colored claws from somewhere in the far north and shy of giving their professions2 ? where human/evelm relations are much less tranquil . They came and sat at the edge of the stage and were quiet , diffident , and probably hugely suspicious . The largest one now and again turned to whisper something to her smaller companions in a voice through which individual words were indistinguishable but which nevertheless sounded like a passing propeller platform ; and I tried to pretend it was n't an interruption . There was the ebullient little fifty-year-old med tech2 ( " . . . this workshift , that is . Last job I had was in a wildlife preserve in the comb-caves in the upper plateaus of the Veng'n'n Range , just about  --  well , quite far east of here . I loved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a possibility of going to work in the bauxite mines out east  --  in accounting , of course . Not actually in the mines . Even with GI , that 's a primary job , of course ... " One suspected she 'd been retired from her own job , , whatever it had been , for at least ten years . " But it still sounds fascinating . Or then , I could always go into . . . " ) One had come to study the sculpture of Bybe't Kohimi ( That 's the name  --  I remember  | now  --  of the artist who did the synapse-pillar 's pedestal and capital ) , of which Dyethshome happens to have the largest collection on the two worlds where she worked . Another had come to explore the documents in one of our libraries on simulacrum technology as it segues into bioengineering . ( Our libraries are both vasty and selective on many subjects . ) Another was here to learn more of the early stage production techniques used in the folk theater of Jae'l Bazerat , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hundred years ago . ( Yes , extensive theater records are all on store in one of our numerous basements . ) By now most of the affable , interested , and really rather bright group were perching or sitting or squatting around the stage edge . ( Maybe five out of the two dozen had gotten stuck out in the first row of seats . ) I sat in the skene 's center , suggesting to Ryla that she not try to see the Kygajewelry collection in the north court until after she had visited the G'har gallery in the west court ; or reassuring R'eb she need n't worry about her various religious food prohibitions while she was here ; or dictating for the third time just so Vagia could make sure she 'd gotten it down right  --  the access number to activate the food choppers in the student kitchen downstairs , since it had been accidentally misprinted in the last brochure . liriani rolled like a flaring tread gear behind high-colored glass , lighting us now deep orange , now pale green , now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-legged on the old planks , every few minutes I would realize that , though he was not among their number , if he had retreated to some hiding place , he was still watching me . And I would halt on a word , then rush on among the coils of whatever explanation I was ensnared in , while my ears and knees flushed redder than the freestanding panes about the amphitheater of our rhetoric . When the session was over , I fled the skene for my room . But by the time I reached the unactivated entrance column , I suddenly found myself afraid of my open platform 's sunset peace . Off I strode again , through underground halls , to search out Maxa and see her mines . Minutes later , when I heard her laughing in one of the lower galleries  | with Alyxander and Bu , I did not activate the drop-lift that would take me to them . Through bright corridors and across drear chambers I wandered into the dark , multi-columned hall we call the Old Library . Like the column by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( more Bybe't ) were the personalities of other dead Dyeths . From the wallboard I took out ( yet again ) one of the tiny crystal volumes of Mother Dyeth 's nine-volume memoirs that , in my rash adolescence , I 'd promised myself I would someday read all through . A wonderful woman , my great-grandmother had a dreadful prose style ; but since so much of her life , not to mention Vondramach 's , has been written about by people who did n't ( including Vondramach ) , those memoirs are like the heaviest ore ? laced with valuable yield , I 'm sure ; but the refinement techniques are all but beyond me . I sat at one of the large scarred tables , pushed open the cover to the dusty reader-screen , funneled the little text crystal ( so different from books ) between my fingers into the receptor dish , and for an hour stared at one page of limp , bitter bombast by a woman by report both salty and pithy . I did not read , from one end to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out between the glimmering ghosts . He was in the polarized chamber . And there were ways to get there without going back through the amphitheater itself . ( Why would you build one if there were n't ? ) What I wanted to avoid were the good-natured students still hanging around the stage . ( " Oh , hey , Marq ! We just wanted to ask you . . . " ) Well , there were ways . But I had to go to another library and look them up to make sure I had the various spells and incantations down . Dyethshome is a hive of mentally activatable intricacies scattered about five courts , and nobody knows them all . Why had n't I thought of this an hour ago ? I probably had . But that many decimal places , not to mention the confusion of Nea , George , and their Thantish theatrics , had fouled my tongue and fingers till I 'd lost all notion of recipe . I rose beside him in a column of light .  | He sat on the cushioned bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , elbows on his knees , bright and bald hands hanging down between . He stared at his toes for all the world as if he were about to pick one . Out on the stage , three students sat and two stood , all laughing at a joke one of the algae-farmers2 had just told . Off to the side in about row twelve , another student was bent over some mechanical gizmo , putting her in touch with a local orchestral performance , or a parent 's admonitions to pay attention to what she ate during the length of her stay , or some other student who could only visit Dyethshome in vaurine projection and wanted an in vivo supplementary account . " Rat Korga ... ? " I said ; and to say the name of your perfect erotic object is always to say it for the first time , even when it is the fiftieth repeated shriek and you are half blind with terror on the crags of a world so far away its night is virtually without stars . He looked up at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green . He frowned a little . The light about me from the entrance column dimmed . Then the frown seemed to crack away ( as all changes of expression registered on his large-pored , pitted face ) . He smiled a little : " Marq Dyeth . . . ? " Then , nervously and surprisingly , he stood . He was so tall . Iiriani was below the back wall of our glass-roofed chamber . But neither he , I , nor the chamber walls around us cast any shadow over the sloping seats  --  like those creatures in the folk tales of a temperate geosector on another world ( I ca n't remember which , damn it ! ) who , by such shadowlessness , signal mutually murderous intents . His rough , unringed fingers came to touch my arm  --  and stopped an inch off , as though he were I and I were Maxa . I said : " I 'm sorry I waited so long to come . " " If you had come earlier ? " His voice was rust rough and mauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I guess that 's those decimals . I said : " Come with me , " and stepped back onto the limen plate .  | ( If he had touched me , would I have fallen to the ground . . . ? ) He stepped forward onto the plate with me . And his left nipple was centimeters above my right eye . I wanted to lean my head back and lick it  --  not from desire but from that idiocy always there to subvert desire and render it ludicrous . Our human heat was a third creature beveling between us . We rose  --  or dropped  --  into the floor . Did Korga think , the first time , that the halls and underground corridors I led him through were more familiar to me than to him ? ( Home is a complicated place ? Well , Dyethshome is more complicated than most . ) Some near lightless passages we walked through ; through some , bright with intricate ceiling fixtures , we were carried along by moving floors with ornate rails whose gilded newels bore likenesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead for two . In one such , as his arm almost brushed mine , the milky wall glowed green . ( The creamy liquor of the local worm . . . ) Small Maxa was running along beside us . From time to time the white coins of her fingertips , the small saucers of her knees pressed to the other side of the pane , as if she could actually see us : " Marq . . . ? Marq , where are you ? Please , Marq , come see my mine ! You promised , Marq ... " Behind her , in the wall screen , I could see where she 'd done a formidable job of construction in one of our old playrooms . Korga looked at me . I smiled . " She wants to take up mining as her profession , , " I explained , and wondered whether he understood  --  or if I should tell him  --  how difficult her disability might make that on some parts of our world . But we turned into another corridor without a call-wall . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the entrance to my room . Korga said : " Marq Dyeth . . . " Both accent and injury kept me from knowing if it were exhortation or interrogation . And because , with either inflection , I had n't the slightest idea what he meant , after a moment 's silence , I said : " This is my room . It 's very far away .... " When he said nothing , I activated the column .  | The Myaluths were profligate with Iiriani-set . He followed me across the carpet . Blinding gold had wedged down between the hills . Morgre 's park levels , ten kilometers off , were a tracing of girders . In the city , a few early lights , green and blue , battled for visibility . The hills were steel-colored ; the sky was indigo and flame , the Hyte-wr , black and purple under its fumes ' unraveling lace . I walked to the desk , pushed aside things that clicked or just toppled , turned to face him , and sat . The overhead lamp came on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung their shadows across my hairy shoulder , down my snarled arms . ( I had n't activated the contraption , but sometimes it just starts up when I near it in certain moods . ) He stopped by the bed , watching me . I turned to look over the rail , beyond the tufted stones . Suddenly I got the strangest sensation that he was no longer behind me . I turned back . He was . ( It 's that reconstruction memory . . . ) As I looked , his eyes came up and caught mine  --  still green . They questioned a moment . Then he sat down , hands beside his hips on the mat . The way his high knees jackknifed  --  and he sort of bent forward now  --  he looked even taller than when he was standing . He brought his hands in . He opened his mouth , closed it again . Then he said , his voice even rougher than before : " Please . . . please , I need you to ? " I stood . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least this much about him . " You . . . you do n't have to ask me , because I ... " It was brief , intense  --  satisfying ? More dizzying , I think . On my bed , on the carpet , and on the bed again ; there was a short time  --  or perhaps it was a long one  --  when we were quiet and very aware of one another . My feelings oscillated ( and I could feel his feelings sometimes lagging behind mine , sometimes moving ahead ) from warmth to misgiving to warmth . We lay on the bed ; and his hand on my chest was a stone outcrop  | on uneven giltgorse . His rough hair , with something reddish in it , was the hue of split tolgoth pith . Knees ? Mine were much closer to my eyes than his . Stones ? Crags ? Hills at two distances . His cheek , near my face , was the slope of the Reya'j'as Plateau ( north , in R-16 ) , which had been peppered with meteors a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thousands of years gone , evelmi once gathered to perform mysteries whose significance even they have forgotten . My own breath against his neck came back to strike my face like a hotwind eroding the prehistorical escarpments of the oest to their characteristic roundness . The line between his arm and my chest was the crevice of some sunken - wr , the near bank , mine , I heavy with growth , the far one , his , notably sparse . I stayed a long time in that landscape , wondering what he would say when he next spoke , wondering what I should say if I spoke first , whether I should let him speak before me . I thought of : Among the thousands of males I 've bedded , at least a dozen times somebody has said to me , " You 'll have to meet so-and-so . You 'll just love him ! " But this has got to be the strangest route I 've ever traveled to end up sleeping with someone . And did n't say it . I glanced at him instead ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory , his eyes blinked . Then I asked : " What world are you . . . ? " He looked down . " Mmmm ... ? " It rumbled in the muscle and bone under my ear . " World ? Where was I . . . ? " My ear was on his arm . So I moved my head a little to hear better . " ... I was remembering a black river . A great river . Under the ground , and lit by golden torches stapled to the rocks . Children in boats , rowing , were terrified because the slimy mantichorion might surge up from the black waters and upset their boat  --  not a real place . " He chuckled . " It 's in a . . . text . From my world . . . no , I do n't know if it 's from my world or not . It may have been brought f there . Nothing important . " He glanced down . " You ? Where are you , now . . . ? " " Underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace in the north of this world  --  where I 'm afraid I have n't spent too much time . " I pushed up on an elbow . " Up there , you know , sex between women of the same gender  --  or of different species  --  is illegal . At least it used to be until a hundred years or so ago . If it is now ,  | frankly , I do n't know . My grandparents told me about it . " I laughed and put my head back to nuzzle his strong armpit . ( Mine , in this heat , with so much more hair , smelled so much less . More genetic divergence within our world-sundered species ? ) He said : " On my world , sex between males was illegal until you were twenty-seven , although it went on pretty constantly anyway . What was completely illegal on my world was sex between a person your height and a person of mine . For all genders . " I pushed up on my elbow again . " Whatever for ? " Sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refraction threshold of his artificial eyes . The balls were glass-filled caves in which small machines sparkled . Korga smiled briefly around them , then looked up at a star in the forking offshoots of a firecactus . The cactus arms , knobby and black above us , hugged a star in its blue patch . He raised his ringed hand to nick his middle fingernail three or four times on his bottom teeth . " It was a law  --  a law that , today , I understand . Thanks to the Web . But all I understood when I was a youngster , living off the refuse of a city whose name I still can not say properly even in my own language , was that I wanted , and was not allowed , to hold a little , hairy male to me whose head I could look down at , to bend my face down to his when he looked up , to rub my mouth and eyes in his hair when he looked down . " He looked at me , no smile now ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " I had chances to do it , or do things close enough to it . " He looked away . " But I have learned more about why my world was the way it was in the time since it has been gone than I ever knew while I lived on it . " " Rat , were you persecuted for your sexual predi ? . . . well , I mean ? " ( The first I was ever aware one could be was on Senthy with Egri and Genya ; there all sadomasochism was hunted out and punished with barbaric single-mindedness ; especially consensual , which their authorities considered the ultimate disease . It was Genya who , as we left that moon in disgust , first pointed out to ten-year-old me how , even as it was suppressed , sadomasochism there was encouraged by every private park and public building around the polar ocean we lived on : all were designed to suggest some weapon or mangle in common use by the local fisherwomen ; all were invariably labeled  | P with some written plaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever legally ? " " Five or six times I was caught and reprimanded , or put in a detention house . " Will sex between humans ever lose its endlessly repeated history ? " Did it stop you from having sex ? " " For a week  --  perhaps even for a few months , the first time . " He moved a little , his whole body . " Finally , I had no sex at all . " During my first three years as an ID , I thought my job1 was not to he surprised at the universe 's human variety . Later I realized that it was not to be surprised that nonstop surprises would henceforth be my life . " If you had asked me , on my world , " Korga said , " whether my five or six run-ins with our laws over sexual infractions had anything to do with my choosing to give sex up for what I thought would be the rest of my life , I would have said no . I had had too many other run-ins for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least of it . If you asked me here , however , lying with you like this , I could not say for sure . " His rough hand , with its heavy jewels , moved an inch over his belly , then rested . " One burden of all of this new knowledge is that old certainties crumble beneath it . But this ? " He watched me with eyes it was hard to believe could see ? " is the first time I have lain down to make love with another person since I was . . . nineteen standard years old . " I swung my feet off the mat and down to the rug and looked back to where this male who was at least forty standard years of age had not moved . " Oh , come on . " No , he had not become anyone else , and yet ? " I ca n't believe that anyone who is my .. . " Calling someone your perfect erotic object to his face seemed suddenly to express the perfection it stood for much too imperfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . eh , standing up since then ? " He shrugged . " Three . . . four . Once with a woman who stole me from my work station . Once before that and once after , with some others ... " " What about before . . . before you were nineteen ? " " A few hundred times  --  as compared to the few thousand you said . " " Oh . " Our geosector has no particular prohibition about virginity ;  | but I had just gotten a little insight into those worlds that have  --  the ones that forbid it totally . " It 's still hard for me to believe . " " They told me , " he said , " you had probably been to bed with several thousand males . They told me you went to bed with males the way I did when I was . . . before my anxiety was terminated . Only for you it was not illegal . They also told me that if I 'd lived a more ordinary life on Rhyonon , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men  --  thousands , rather than the hundred or so I did  --  I would probably feel very different about your going to bed with them than I do . " Once more the empty eyes came back to me . " Do n't you ever persecute people here for their sex ? " " Oh , no , " I said . " I mean , I told you , a long time ago , in the north ? " " The language , " he said . " That 's what I mean . " I frowned . " I lived on a much younger world , on which  --  they told me in the Web  --  we spoke a much older language . We had men ' and women , ' bitches ' and dogs . ' The men were all male and were called he ' and the women were female and called she ' ? " " I know the word man , ' " I said . " It 's an archaic term . Sometimes you 'll read over it in some old piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a kind of . . . " He mused a moment ? " . . . persecution . " " Perhaps to someone who 's used to them . . . " I said . " We just have different ? " But he chuckled , briefly and for no more than three syllables . " On my world he ' was what everyone , male or female , wanted to be . . . perhaps the males thought they were a little closer to it . On your world and , I have been told , on the vast majority of others , he ' is what everyone , male and female , wants to have . Perhaps all of us are equally far away from that . " " You do n't like that I 've gone to bed with as many people as I have  --  or the way we talk about it ? " " I do n't think about it . " " Mmm . " I pondered . " You know , if you 'd lived a more ordinary life on Rhyonon , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . me ? " He did n't smile . How long did it take me to understand he really  | did find things funny , but that humor for him  --  or for his world , I still do n't know which  --  was simply the most private of emotions ? He said : " They told me , and told me again , and told me yet again : I must remember that I am not on my world , I am on yours . " The bedding whispered , shifted ; he sat up beside me , where I was sitting , at the edge . His naked knees were above mine and wide apart . His eyelids smiled above me . " They also told me that when I do n't know what to do , I should do what the person nearest me does  --  while I decide the questions I need to ask . " He was quiet a moment ; then he let out a long breath . " I never knew there was this much to know . " I started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on my knee . We looked at it . The flesh was thick and dry . Through my thigh hair about them , I could feel wide palm and broad fingers , unsure of their own weight , now adding a little to it , now taking a little away . I thought : it feels more like warm stone than the bone-and-meat-filled hide it is . I reached out two fingers . My own hands have always struck me as very ordinary : the fairly small , somewhat fleshy hands of a fairly small , somewhat hairy fellow who only uses them for manual labor one job out of three ; and , wonderful as I 've always found nail-biting in others , I 've never been able to sustain the habit myself , so gave up trying long ago . I put my middle fingertip on wide copper set around both edges with green stone chips , some opaque , some glassy , the metal between geometrically embossed . The ring one further forward bunched his broad knuckle skin before it , wrinkled as a big knot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched my forefingertip to his forenail  --  side to side twice the width of my thumb . It emerged from beneath the cuticle bank , thickened against as much gnawing as the horn , went on the distance of the paler moon and that distance again , before the support structure broke down ( I can not say " was undermined " because all that could be had been , and then been bitten away ) ; for this distance again , it clutched at the quick , its edges pitted so smally and myriadly it presented the regularity of the endlessly attacked border , marked by the dirt of an unknown task3 . The crown rose and curved away , twice the length of the nail itself , as it did on all his fingers , thrice , on thumb and little . As my fingertips moved on its upper surface , the heavy crown seemed of  | equal hardness  --  and clearly of greater endurance  --  as the horn . That surface bore the swirls and lines  --  fainter of course , and interrupted , and scarred  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved mN hand , feeling the textures , copper , stone , nail , skin ; and thought about the mechanics through which we locate beauty . By art , we can only do it through a disinterested precision which represses , while it mimes , all the interest that impels it . And we can only hope the difference between the repressed and the represented will read as intensity . His hand was beautiful . Korga said : " You see now : what my fingers hold is not only what my life has become since my world 's death . You may find in their scars , if you look , all the poverty of the time before . " " Does that hurt ? " I asked . " Does it worry you ? " " It hurts . " He lifted his hand from under mine , put his arm around my shoulder ; again I felt warm metal , cool flesh . " But one thing about what was done to me on my world : there are many worriesmany kinds of worries  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you wonder what I would be like without it ? It 's not supposed to change who you are ... " " I had n't , " I said . " Yet . " What I did wonder was what worries a tyrant , priest , and poet , dead two hundred years , had carried with her after such an operation . For a while , I felt one finger move on my shoulder , then another . He said : " Your family  --  they are very angry . " I looked up at him , wondering what he could mean . " I know very little of families , " I said . " I had none , " he said , " though I used to think of them a lot . . . when I was younger . " " I do n't follow you , " I said . " What family ? " He looked down , with the slight brief smile of puzzlement that was so like his slight brief smile of pleasure . " When I came in from the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh  --  was angry at your black sister ; finally she took her outside while the rest of you watched . " " George  --  my . . . ? " I looked up . " Nea . . . ? " I stood and I went to he chair on which his wrinkled pants were piled , here and  | there in the folds showing metal belt-links . " They 're not even from our world . George and Nea are Thants . They 're friends of Dyeth . " But when it dawned on me , I laughed out loud . " You thought we were a family . . . ? " Then I smiled . " Suddenly some of the things you 've been saying begin to make sense . No , the Dyeths are very much our own nurture stream  --  at least that 's the translation of the northern evelmi 's term for it . This particular nurture stream has been bubbling along for seven ripples now . There 're only two older streams in the area  --  one at the tracer collective and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that upset if ours went on for seventeen or twenty-seven more . " There are so many small movements of response you expect from people when they listen to you  --  there the head nods slightly , here it raises a little , now the eyelids narrow . He , who , against me , forehead to foot , had responded so that , minutes ago , he had seemed an extension of myself , only sat , only watched . Though I was sure he listened as intently as anyone else could possibly listen ( as intently as I knew I listened to him ) , still , before his still face , to believe it was all faith . " I was adopted by the Dyeths when I was a baby  --  from some infant exchange in the north ; but most of my sisters come from even farther south . Small Maxa was semisomed from some neuroplasm that an evelm grandmother of mine , N'yom , donated to a bioengineering experiment many many years ago and that was just taken out of suspension about a decade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chromosome sequence was taken from humans . But in the genetic sense she 's part evelm . Still , there is no egg-andsperm relation between any of our parents and any of this generation of children , nor between any of my sisters  --  human or evelm  --  and each other . " But certainly the Web had told him this . Somewhere away from where words gather before speaking , I vaguely saw us taking a walk outside around the platform while we talked . And because such images are closer to movement than words , I moved , planning to speak . But he stood , with me , before words came . And walked with me as I started to walk . ( Thus faith is rewarded . ) " Rhyonon was a Family world , was n't it ? " As we passed my workdesk , for a moment the lamp above it gave his eyes back their whites and greens . And the demon vanished into his pitted face . " At least someone told me that it was about to fall over in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They told me in the Web that that 's the side you and your stream . . . your world is on . " I said : " It 's also supposed to be the side that Japril and most of the Web are on . . . unless there 's been some new information that I 'm not privy to . " At the rail , I lifted up the ornate triple hook from its hasp and swung out the lacquered gate . Korga nodded as we started down the wide plank steps . " My world was just about to join with the Family officially  --  when it was destroyed . " Korga 's toes and the balls of his feet were so big they hung over the edge of each step as he stepped down . His sole 's thick rims were rough and cracked , like a woman 's gone barefoot twenty years on sand . " And I did not even know there was a clash between them or , really , the name of either side . " As we walked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way people much taller than you sometimes do , he rested one hand on my shoulder . That almost made me want to cry . " Tell me about the Dyeths , " he said , as we turned on the clearing to walk beside the raised platform . " Gylda Dyeth . . . " I said  --  recited really , as I would have in any orientation session2 had some student asked me the same question ; frequently when I want to cry , I recite . " Gylda Dyeth migrated here to Velm , when she was nineteen , in a small shuttle of eight thousand colonists from a world called Klaven , which had recently become fearful of Cultural Fugue . It 's a problem certain **30;172;TOOLONG worlds , with an economic variation displacement of more than point-seven-six , are prone to fall into . . . " I halted , thinking of Rhyonon . There 's a ten-day period right after hotwind season when I would n't let anyone  --  no matter how rough her feet  --  walk barefoot on fallen fire-cactus needles . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey ) . But at this time of year they heap about in brown piles over the scrumbly soil ( and the trunks are deep maroon ) . Those under our feet were almost as soft as the powder-soil discarded by the nematode strainers , or ( more accurately ) the sloughed scales over the floor of a seven-generation dragon cave . His hand still on my shoulder , we turned to take the circuit of blunt prickles . " I 've always imagined Gylda , when she got here , looking somewhat like Nea Thant does now  --  a tall , intense , black woman  | with somewhat yellowish eyes . She spent six years on Velm , first in the north at the other end of the world , and then here in the south . It was on a religious visit to our little moon , Arvin , where she met the woman who once wore your rings . " " Vondramach Okk . . . " He said the name with the uncertainty of a native evelm passing some polysyllabled human word from tongue to tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marta told me of Vondramach Okk . " " They hit it off pretty well . Gylda spent the next five years standard in Vondramach 's services , doing jobs for her offworld that I like to imagine were somewhat similar to what I do today . Only my better judgment tells me that , given grandma 's youthful accomplishments and Okk 's mature needs , they were probably quite a bit nastier . Those five years took her all over the galaxy  --  sometimes with Vondramach , sometimes without . But as she had left Klaven , she finally left Vondramach 's service and came back here to Velm . They parted on good terms . When she returned to this world , here to Morgre , Vondramach gave her  --  or had built for her  --  well , here it looks like we 're outside it ? " " Dyethshome ? " I nodded . We walked between tall cactus trunks . Brown needles brushed our shoulders . Thick shadows from the platform 's central lamp barred the ground . Ahead , rocks broke away beneath netmoss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , was up . Beneath it , the stream broiled through its crevice , searching for Whitefalls . " But there 's nothing much more I can really say about it , other than that it 's a stream where you are as welcome as I am , because each ripple , each wave and rill is held to the other by love . And I . . . well , guess I love you . " I sighed . We stepped wide of a small stone crevice onto netmoss . Last year 's deader , darker tangle cushioned the coppery web of this year 's . On the far rocks , banks of elephant lichen ( trace of the Web 's planoforming , common to so many worlds ) raised their crinkly barks in the night-light . Suddenly Korga 's hand dropped from my shoulder . " That . . he said . " That 's running water . . . ? " " Yes . It joins with Whitefalls further along . "  | " It 's the first I 've ever seen . " He squatted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , measured over vertebrae and ribs and planed one side with star- and Arvinlight , ghostly through cactus branches . He held his hand over waters ribbed with their own quivering rush . Momentarily stones and metal seemed suspensors holding those heavy fingers up . He lowered them . Water bubbled at his palm 's edge , stilled between his knuckles . ( His big toes broke the earth he squatted on . ) He submerged his hand . I asked : " Does the cold water do anything to the rings ' functioning ? " He looked up . " Perhaps it gives me a kind of . . . But it 's only the chill that would happen to anyone putting a hand in cold water . " He stayed there almost a whole minute . " No . " When he stood , I said : " This way . " His hand wet and warm on my shoulder , we came on around the platform 's fifth corner . As we started toward the stairs , I asked : " Rat , what do you feel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " all this " was . He said : " Relief , mostly . They told me you existed  --  I had to wait most of a standard year , learning how to be a person who might walk , speak , and listen in your world . " " Relief . . . " I smiled . " Yes . I feel that too . They told me that you existed . And yet somehow my going on involved pretending you did n't . " " All around the relief ? " Korga 's wide heels hung from the back of each step as we climbed ? " there is still anxiety . Yours , mostly . I sense it not as an emotional activity , but as a tenseness . Desire is still there ; expectation is still there . A single orgasm in a single hour has not given me an answer . " Which made me gasp a little . " Yes , I feel that too . . . . " I pushed through the gate ; he followed me . " And yet we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We are both in very different situations . " " We 're both ? " I started to say from very different worlds . " We are each likely to have very different feelings at what comes upon us as well . I know for myself ? " I turned at the rail as he closed the gate behind him and stepped up to stand next to me : " I know I want to do wonderful things for you , because watching you , being near  | I you , not to mention touching you or holding you , gives me so much pleasure . I suppose somewhere the rational part of me is wondering if perhaps the differences between us might not end up with my hurting over them , but ... " After a strangely long while he said ( and he was halfway through his sentence before I realized it was an answer to mine ) : " You give me so much pleasure , why should I ever want to hurt you ? " Somehow I assumed , in the search for difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the growing pedal-bass of a sand scooter . I looked up to see if Korga was frowning at the sound . ( He was n't . ) " Rat , I think someone is . . . " I leaned down on the rail , t I folding my arms and hunching my shoulders . Beside me Korga grasped the rail , arms straight , and did n't lean at all . We looked across the clearing , beyond the night rocks , to distant Morgre 's glimmer . Purple threads luminesced palely over the Hyte . At the horizon a few clouds streaked jet against starry blue . First two scooters , then three more , bounced up over the rock ridge . All but one had two riders . " Here it is ! Look ! Here ! " one called . Scooters swerved , slowed , hummed . One and another they halted before the platform . The woman who 'd called out was our retired med-tech2 . She got off the plastic and silver and treads and foils that made up her shared mount . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The med-tech2 rubbed the silver filigree on her openwork head-protector and turned to look across the dark stones , out at the handful of glitter that was Morgre . " Yes , this is certainly the view I visited in vaurine . The commentary said , now , that , in the fourth generation of Dyeths , several of them established their personal living rooms in this area . " She was reciting from a prospectus that she must have memorized with the help of General Info . " Do any of them still live here , Mima ? " asked one of the evelm students still seated with all six legs drawn up on her swaying bike .  | I nudged Korga 's hand with my elbow and grinned as he glanced at me . " Let me see . . . It does n't say anything about that in my program , " the med-tech2 , Mima , said . " But during the Bazerat productions . some of the younger Dyeths  --  Genya , Ari , or Maxa  --  would invite the performers and the technicians up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitate the rehearsals . " ( Yes , mine/Ari 's is the only one left . ) " Imagine , playmakers like Vhed'dik and Cy'yja , or actors like Kand'ri , Sejer'hi , or Jae'l Bazerat herself may have stood right here and declaimed the lines of the Priest Passmar't , or the Worm Digger Avess , or the Human Ambassador David . " ( Kand'ri 's portrayal of the human David , without make-up or holographic assistance , is considered a high point in the illusionist art of the highly illusive theater by evelmi and humans alike . Myself , though I 'm impressed , I 've always been more moved by the evelm actors ' clouds , rocks , winds , and oilslicks . But these have a millennium of oestern equatorial tradition behind them . ) " Any one of them , " repeated the diminutive Mima , " might have stood right where I 'm standing now ! " Actually it was about two meters back , where Korga and I were leaning . A tall woman I did n't recognize dismounted her scooter . She wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other human students turned to her and said : " It was very nice of you to rent these scooters for us so we could come out and explore the landscape . It 's left the taste of friendship in our mouths . " The tall woman said : " I am only too pleased to help the local students . " Her voice had the faintly singsong quality of someone who had just learned the language through GI  --  a quality which , offworld , I hardly even noticed anymore , but which I had found myself listening constantly for in Rat 's speech , only to find the gross deformation in both consonants and vowels that told of an awkwardly muscular attachment to a vanished language system I could not comprehend . " I am only sad , " the woman went on , " that I have not yet met among your number the woman whose history particularly intrigues me . Well , as your study session goes on , perhaps one of you will introduce me . I intend to stay in Morgre for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to spend as much time in your company  | as you would like to spend in mine . " I wondered briefly if she were from one of the mining or manufacturing hegemonies further north . Korga 's and my shadows lay across the clearing among the shadows the students and their scooters cast in my platform 's lamplight . About a meter and a half away , right in front of the steps , one woman turned slowly in a full circle : " It 's astonishing ! We 're here , all alone , with only history and the landscape . " As her eyes swept unseeing past ours , Korga looked at me , his features faintly unsettled on his deeply pocked face ; I would soon learn that was as close to surprise as he got . " They do n't see us . . . ? " " Nor our platform . Nor do they hear us . " I chuckled through a smile . " That 's the chance you take , wandering the local countryside . You never know when you 're chatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We 're invisible to them , " Korga said . " The way the chamber was . Back in the amphitheater . " I frowned . " Not exactly . In fact it 's entirely different . The reason they ca n't see or hear us is because they 're there , up in the hills , ten kilometers out from Morgre , and we 're still in Dyethshome  --  which is just at the edge of Morgre complex itself . " I pointed over the students ' heads to the far city . " If it were a little lighter , you could make out the three stained-glass walls around the amphitheater . . . right about . . . there . Ten kilometers off . Which is where we are  --  right now . " Korga looked down at the students in front of us . He said in a perfectly normal voice : " The spiders who sent me here said that I must study such things while I am here at Dyethshome and learn to grow comfortable in such a technology . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see them whisper . " What a wonderful rise that looks like over there . " One of the evelm , her steel-colored claws indistinct in the evening light , reared beside her scooter and pointed ( with her longest tongue ) . " Let 's go take a look at the view from there , " she said ( with one of her others ) , " and maybe we can catch the big moonrise . " " You 're sure you 're not ready to go back to town ? " The algaefarmer2 on the far scooter stuck out her own human tongue toward Morgre . ( I 've heard northerners say we southerners  --  human  --  who  | point like that just seem affected . ) " I 'll just take one of the scooters back by myself . You can all double up . . . " Oh , no ! " declared the rather hefty evelm , stepping about on five of her six claws . " Please come with us , " said the tall masked human with the GI singsong . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . . . " Evelmi are a lot stronger physically than humans ; and , in most of their societies , a lot more easygoing . The first is hereditary , the second cultural ; and the interplay of both with humans from two profoundly different agricultural-intensive worlds has produced the tragedy of the north . The big farmer2 laughed . " All right , I 'll go , " and she flung her high-booted leg back over the scooter seat . As the scooters swerved off toward another fine view of the star-lit Vyalou , I found myself thrown back through the many rides , night and day , I had taken over this landscape . " Rat , " I said , " why do n't you come with me ? " " I should go back to the other students now , " he announced , almost as I spoke . His own thoughts had been turning among his own feelings , behind his still face . " No , I do n't mean now . Tomorrow . Come dragon hunting with me . Tomorrow morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't think of any better way . Go back to the other students . I 'll meet you in the student quarters just at ? " I paused . " What month is it now ? " ( Those words , spoken or thought , are the signal for GI to play the time , day , week , month , and year across your consciousness by direct cerebral access : And it was ten o'clock of a balmy Yumber night , the seventeenth month of our seven-season year of twenty-five thirty-one-day cycles . ) " Yes , just at sunrise . That 's what we 'll do . You go on now ? " It was only because I was imagining seeing him again that I could dare tell him to go  --  and the telling was pain : something dull throbbed behind my knees . Above my testicles and between my shoulder blades , there seemed to be two pulleys , with a taut cable between , trying and failing to wind in opposite directions . He looked at me , took a little step back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . ) " Marq . . . " Korga 's beardless and cratered  | lace was lit sideways by the orange orrery light that I knew was shining down on my own , bearded and smooth . One after the other , his face did not achieve three expressions . His knee , suspended nearly a meter above his wide and horny foot , moved  --  bone under flesh . I watched the small , rough triangle of drier skin that humans , male and female , develop after age thirty-five a centimeter below the patella in a naturally selective response to some environmental condition vanished now a millennium . He stood by the chair where his pants lay . Suddenly he raised one hand to the other . Finger struggled with finger . One ring came off . He pulled off another three . What did I feel ? Numb tenor . And what numbed finally sent the terror itself below perception 's limen , so that all I saw was dim or brilliant stone , dull or bright metal , rough or wrinkled flesh occluded and occluded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled off the remaining three . And put them down . " Marq Dyeth . . . ? " I wanted to tell him to go back to the others . I wanted to raise my hands to his wide shoulders . And while I wanted , his own hands came up to cage the sides of my head in his rough palms , his hard fingers . And I raised mine . Both of us really naked for the first time , we made love . Some three hours later , he put on his pants , his rings , his belt ; and left .  | I pushed up the sarbdown sleeping mat  --  local shoots sewn in an envelope ( green ) manufactured off in one of the more abhorrent northern pits . Iirianilight , shattered by cactus trunks , rouged the carpet , the desk drawer handles , the bed legs . I thought : " Today I am going dragon hunting ! " ? remembering when I 'd first thought it , age seven , my first hunt ; and when I 'd thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh ; and why this hundred twentysixth would be different ? " We will hunt ! We will sing ! " I walked to the platform 's west edge . Light fell between the thicker trunks . Hands apart , I grasped the rail and looked over . A small , nine-shelf lizard perch was built out from the platform base  --  the kind they use in the eastern mountains . The palm-sized shelves , of redpith , silver , and bone , were kollec-four  --  the pidgin term from the forecasting process evelm hunters have used about five thousand years now in our several climes . Kollec-four : four finger-length lizards had , by now , availed themselves of the ornate inlaid platforming . The little lizards are , evolutionarily speaking , close cousins to the great beasts we would pursue  --  and rather more distant cousins to the evelmi who first hunted them .  | The hunters invoke complex divinations using the perch : from the sex of the small beasts found on it at sunrise , which platform they perch on , which direction they face , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each other 's life-fate , and the governmental policies of their tribes and federations . Fine points vary from area to area . But what I knew was simply that when winged neuter lizards squat on the upper silver or bone ( cooler , of course , than the dark pith lower down ) , it means spawning is less than two nights off and all three sexes of the greater dragon will be clustering around the nesting spas ; if , however , little females crawl on the dark-colored lower platforms , male and neuter dragons aplenty will be flapping and flopping over the feeding grounds  --  no , I 'm not sure why it works , though it 's been explained to me enough times . Three of the lizards on the red platforms near the bottom had the female gilded gill-ruff . The fourth , a wingless male , was climbing down from bone to wood , flickering pale tongues , stepping about on six single-spurred feet : a day for the feeding grounds  --  which are more picturesque than the spas anyway . I turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become , at my will and silent incantation , the entrance column . I walked to it . I thought . Light rose . I fell into the foggy corridor . I walked along tapestried halls , or ones with web-hangings that had once decorated a distant evelm cave complexes . There are stairways up to the amphitheater . I climbed one , came out a side kiosk looking over the stage , and strolled out on the boards . In the gray light , a warm breeze anticipated hotwinds . Arms folded , I ambled before the stone steps at the stage-back up to the west-court arch . I looked over the empty seats fanning from me , to the freestanding walls of ornamental glass , their panes dull , now Iiriani was before them . The kiosk down to the student quarters was behind the bank of fountains at the stage 's north edge . As I came around the stone rim , I almost tripped over a mat stretched out before the door . " Oh , excuse me ? ! " She sprang up ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , hey , Marq . . . ! " Around her neck she wore the streamers that over the past few years I had  | seen from time to time in the streets of Morgre and that  --  for the past few days ? 1 now knew came from Beresh . " You 've come to take Korga hunting ! " She sank back to her knees . " That 's going to he wonderful for him . I wish we could all go with you . . . to watch him at the dragons . But . . . " She arched her gumridge . I smiled back , confused : I had n't meant to keep it secret . . . " Oh , here ! Let me move my bed so you can . . . we just thought it would be a good idea if someone slept out here in case anyone came in to see him who was n't . . . " She shrugged scaly haunches . " Well , someone who was n't supposed to . " With the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few feet back from the door , dropped it . " Oh , " I said . " Sure . " Still smiling , still confused , I walked into the kiosk and down the spiral stair . The first chamber , with its stalactites and cool pools , was a replica of the antechamber of the cave of the P'ol 'd of Q'ik'har , a great ( evelm ) Senator of the north , whose incredible complex , built eight hundred years ago , Shoshana says , has influenced architecture all over this world  --  human as much or more than evelm . As I came down beneath the dim dawn colors of the skylight , the inlaid steps widened ; and I recalled , as I so frequently did in this hall , a conversation I once had with a famous v'ea 'd ( the ' d is the same root word as in P'ol 'd and means something between professor emeritus , systems analyst , and black widow ) from one of the seven hundred university-chains that wind from federation to federation over the surface of this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The v'ea 'd had told me , as we strolled the nighttime crags of G'groth , below which smoked the Z'yz-wr : " That we evelmi can , with many of our tongues , reproduce sounds you humans will accept as language has probably generated as much evil as it has good between our species . The real affinity between us is that all our myriad cultures , and all yours , are founded on love of illusion . It is not that we both talk , but that we both talk endlessly of persons , places , things , and ideas that are not currently before us to taste . It is not that we both build home-caves , construct travel-guiders that stretch for thousands of kilometers over the land , lay out social grounds , or put together musical compositions and complex combinations of food and flavored stone , but that we both build , construct , lay out , and put together these things according  | to plans , visions , imaginative schemes that , until we have realized them , have no real existence . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenish bronze that had blacked in the big moon 's light . " In the north , Marq Dyeth , I have been in raiding parties that have slaughtered you humans , as humans have slaughtered my sisters , my university colleagues , my male groomers and females whom I have groomed . There is no peace between human and evelm . It is only an illusion I am in love with as much as you , and it is what allows us to walk and talk together here in the south on this chill evening . " As I went down , seeking Korga , how many worlds , I wondered , how many ways of life had suddenly made the transition to illusion , to mere memory , to meaning without referent ? I stepped from the bottom step and looked over the underground lakes ( and though history had more or less absolved the P'ol 'd , she had been none too fond of those university chains by the end of her reign ) and started over the clay floor toward the dormitory . All the sleeping shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cassettes ; anyone who brought hers with her and put it into the playback would erect a fuzzy black sphere around the blue plastic sleeping-pad holder , her own environment within . Usually one could count on eight or nine dark clouds . There was only one , in the far corner , fuzzily private . Usually less than half the students , up late talking together , ended up falling out together here in the dormitory , since there were enough individual living rooms further along the hall to accommodate many times the usual student load . This morning on practically every shell there was a student curled on green , yellow , or purple matting . They were all here ... ! Korga lay on his side in a shell near the center , one frayed knee up , one out , unringed hand off the edge . All six shells directly around his were empty . As I started in among them , one of the students  --  the one studying Bybe't Kohimi  --  raised her dark head and , blinking , recognized me : " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was wonderful when she came back here last night . We started talking with her . And she talked so simply . . . about her world , and what happened to it . Imagine ! "  | And the evelm student on the shell beside her rumbled in her sleep , " Imagine . . . When she came back . . . imagine ... " I gave her a smile nowhere near as surprised as I felt . I moved toward him among the shells . Someone turned on her pad . Another woke . I heard someone swing her legs from the shell to sit . They were waking each other . I reached his bunk ? " Rat " ? took hold of his thumb , and pulled . " Time to hunt dragons . " He opened his green eyes slowly . The lids slid up the balls ; that motion finished , his head rotated toward me ; that motion done , he sat up on the shell 's edge and dropped his feet over  --  you have to understand this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I recalled Japril 's descriptions of his waking after his rescue and knew now what she 'd meant . " Hello , Marq Dyeth . " " Urn . . . Rat , " I said again . " It 's time to go hunting . " Another student was up and standing beside the dark cloud around the cassetted shell , pressing the call button and calling softly : " Mima ! ... Mima ! ... " As he stood , a muscle tightened on Korga 's jaw , moving the dark skin with its small , beautiful wounds , the irregular motion completely at odds with his inhumanly smooth movements . At his waist , for about eight inches , his chain belt had left link marks , while the pants themselves were now inches below ; the hair down on the great knob of his ankle lay flat to the bone on the outside and , I saw as the foot moved on the clay , spreading as he put his weight on it , still hazy at the other . Another student in an upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up .... " As I walked with him out among the shells , I wondered at my own fascination at those places where sleep had inscribed his body at head , hip , and foot . I wondered too what had happened here before sleep . He had come as a student , yet I had never imagined his sharing their late talk , their brief or lingering affections . With no desire to keep our relation from them , I was still distinctly uncomfortable with what they might or might not have known . As soon as we reached the tiled pool , I whispered : " Rat , what did you tell them last night ? "  | 1 Ile looked down at me . " I answered their questions . " And his hand came down on my shoulder . Which made me feel better . " What did they ask ? " We started up the steps . He said ( and I realized as he said it that what I had heard yesterday as roughness in his voice today seemed more like a resilient , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I came from , what happened there ; they asked why I came here , where I had gone with you , what we had done ; they asked what we would do today . " " Oh . " We neared the top door . " And you told them .... " From time to time I 've bedded the odd student come to study , but till now better judgment had always made me put it off to the last few days of the session2 when the class is winding up and plans are being made to go home  --  for everybody 's peace of mind . At the top of the kiosk , the student who 'd decided to lie guard at the entrance , squatted on her sleeping mat , hugging her middle knees with her forelegs and watching . " Good hunting . Good singing . " I nodded , smiled , and tried not to skirt too fast around the fountains . On the stone steps up to the archway , Bucephalus and Black Lars ( a step above ) sat ; and Alyxander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rat , " Black Lars muttered in her sisterly basso that with age had begun to pick up the same burr I identified with Large Maxa . " Good morning , Marq . " " We were wondering if you two wanted to come and breakfast with us before you went off to hunt . " Alyxander fingered one of the small grey jewels clipped to her genital hair , which  --  as a human woman  --  was all she wore mornings . Her head hair was feathery , short , and for some reason wet . The breeze shivered it a little . She stood on the uneven stones , as the rose ruff on Black Lars ' black neck shook to the same breeze . " Of course , if you would prefer ? " Black Lars switched tongues and voice timbre in the midst of the verb ? " to remain and eat with the other students , we would understand . " Always reticent with strangers , Bucephalus only moved her long tail twice to the left and twice to the right as it lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the last five years , was a sign of friendliness the neuter evelmi in an isolated mountain tribe in the far south used with one another , a language and custom that had all but  | baffled some of this world 's leading ethnologists till very recently . wondered if she thought this was communication . " Eh . . . well , thanks . " I was n't sure if siblings or students were the breakfast companions Korga wanted . Rat said : " I would like to come eat with you . " He looked at me . " Sure , " I said . " Sounds fine . " I mean they were trying to he nice . " Did you sleep well ? " Black Lars asked Rat as we started up the steps : she rose on her three downward legs as we reached them . Alyxander , on her human two , fell in beside me . " We came in to say hello to the students last night , " Black Lars explained , looking at me now , " just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to her world , about coming here to see you , that you were going hunting  --  and the relationship between you " I would have told you , " I said . " Only I did n't get a ? " But Lars had turned back to gaze at Rat anyway . Last to get up , Bucephalus only bounded after us when we were practically at the door . We walked under the stone arch , the hanging green . In the shadowed mirrors I watched the five of us , Alyxander on two feet ( the tallest ) , Bucephalus , on all tufted sixes ( the shortest ) ? though she was also the longest  --  approach the doors . Rat and I were dull in the plates , which , in this light , showed scars and old scratches . We moved forward , among my siblings ' indistinct gestures , dim attentions , and shadowy concerns . " We do n't usually divert the water through the fountain and spillway system inside the house , " Shoshana explained , " unless we 're having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucephalus , about ten minutes ago , after presenting her food-gift and a polite minute of conversation . ( " It 's a shame we do n't divert the water through the spillway system more often , but we only do that for a formal ... " )
