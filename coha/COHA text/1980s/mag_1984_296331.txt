T.S . ELIOT : A LIFE by Peter Ackroyd ; Simon &; Schuster ; 400 pages ; $24.95 <P> Since plowing through lists of strange names can be dull business , the only people likely to read the acknowledgments in most books are either insomniacs or the ones who are mentioned and thanked by the author for their help . Occasionally , though , these dutiful expressions of gratitude can yield useful information about the works they precede . This first full-length biography of T.S . Eliot ( 1888-1965 ) is a case in point . After acknowledging away for nearly two pages , Peter Ackroyd , an English critic and poet , concludes with a terse paragraph : " I am forbidden by the Eliot estate to quote from Eliot 's published work , except for purposes of fair comment in a critical context , or to quote from Eliot 's unpublished work or correspondence . " <P> This injunction seems insurmountable . How to write the life of one of this century 's greatest poets without including more than a handful of his words ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definitive biography ; Eliot 's estate , following the poet 's wishes , stands staunchly in the path of any such study . But T.S . Eliot : A Life does more than make the best of a difficult situation ; it offers the most detailed portrait yet of an enigmatic and thoroughly peculiar genius . <P> The main outlines of Eliot 's career are well known . Born in St. Louis , a scion of the Midwestern branch of a distinguished American family , he studied English literature at Harvard and then pursued , with diminishing zeal , a Ph.D . in philosophy . He settled in London and worked in a bank to support himself and his English wife . When he found time and inspiration , he wrote poems , including The Waste Land ( 1922 ) , that helped shape the 20th century imagination . He took up British citizenship and abandoned the Unitarianism of his parents to become a convert to the Anglican Church . He spent the last four decades of his life more or less in the public eye , a polite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . His plays , including Murder in the Cathedral , The Cocktail Party and The Confidential Clerk , won him increased fame , as did his Nobel Prize for Literature in 1948 . In 1956 , 14,000 people gathered in Minneapolis to hear him speak on " The Frontiers of Criticism . " <P> Behind this austere facade , Ackroyd finds a tormented and divided soul . Eliot shied away from attention while courting it with Machiavellian skills . Ezra Pound , another American expatriate , aptly nicknamed him " Old Possum . " Pound had tried and failed to take over literary London through energy and bravado ; Eliot succeeded through diffidence and self-denigration . He invited sympathy ; friends who knew he was overworked were startled to see him wearing a green face powder that accentuated his cadaverous pallor . Yet he repulsed those who tried to ease his burdens ; several plans to raise money that would free Eliot of his bank duties only aroused his resentment .                    @
