Former police Supt. Richard Brzeczek was acquitted of theft and misconduct charges Thursday , then launched into a tirade outside court about what he called a " conspiracy to come after me . " He concluded by declaring himself no longer a public figure . Brzeczek told reporters that the charges should never have been brought against him and called Cook County State ' s Atty . Richard M. Daley a " fraud " who " set out to destroy me politically , personally and professionally . " Brzeczek ' s comments came after Criminal Court Judge Robert Boharic found him not guilty of 24 counts of theft and official misconduct . The judge ruled that Chicago Police Department financial records were kept by " bureaucratic forgers " and were not accurate enough to prove that Brzeczek stole $1 , 231 in city money to take trips to visit his former girlfriend . After the verdict Brzeczek hugged and kissed his wife , went downstairs to face reporters and television cameras and began a 15-minute diatribe against Daley , some of his former police colleagues and his onetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a judge , " Brzeczek said . " Who it is , I don ' t know , if it ' s going to be on this planet or sometime in the afterlife . Richard Daley has to spend the rest of his life looking in the mirror when he shaves in the morning to determine what he did  --  not only to me , but to my wife and family . " Richard Daley is a fraud . He ' s trying to take advantage of a dead man ' s name , a man who ' s been dead almost 11 years , and Daley can not stand on his own two feet . " Brzeczek ran for state ' s attorney in the election of November , 1984 , as a Republican but lost to Daley by a 3-to-1 margin . Since his indictment , his lawyers have said that the charges were politically motivated . But Michael Angarola , Daley ' s first assistant , said Daley had excused himself from the case from the start . Angarola told the media that he , not Daley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out to get him , " Angarola said . He said that his office has sought indictments of police officers for taking $10 or $20 bribes and that he approved the charges against Brzeczek because he did not want a " double standard " to exist between patrolmen and the superintendent . " Mr. Brzeczek is under a lot of pressure , " he said . " I can understand how he would lash out in a tirade . I don ' t think there ' s any need for any member of this office to respond to that kind of tirade . " Brzeczek , 44 , was accused of misusing police department money to take three trips to San Diego and Minneapolis in 1982 with stewardess Sonja Butterfield , 47 , his former girlfriend . Financial vouchers indicated that Brzeczek was attending business meetings in those cities . But witnesses testified that those meetings never took place in those cities on those dates , and Butterfield said Brzeczek rarely left her side during the trips . Boharic theorized that Brzeczek could have falsely filled out the vouchers but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not know the true nature of his trips . " They proved he was cheating on his wife , " the judge said . " They absolutely proved that . " Boharic said some testimony indicated that police financial record keeping was " ill-managed " and unreliable . One clerk admitted that she altered records to make the books balance . Defense lawyers George Murtaugh Jr. and Thomas Breen had contended that the state ' s case involved " innuendo " and was based on flawed documents . After the ruling , Brzeczek ' s wife , Elizabeth , who once filed for divorce but who has since been reconciled with her husband , said , " I love and admire my husband . . . . I had a tremendous amount of faith in him . " She stood beside him as Brzeczek , police superintendent from 1980 to 1983 , faced the cameras and reporters . He said his former girlfriend had once threatened that " someday she will get me and she will get my wife . " He also blamed " vindictive " former police department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indictment . Brzeczek concluded by saying : " I will absolutely under no circumstances permit myself or my family to be subjected to the mediocrity of public life in the future . I , as a public figure , am ending as of today , May 14 , 1987 . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Ovie Carter . Brzeczek cleared of theft charges . Former Police Supt.
