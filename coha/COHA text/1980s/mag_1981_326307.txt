A powerful troika takes charge , while Haig overdoes it-once more The first reactions were shock , horror , sickness at the thought that the nation had to go through it all once more . Then almost instantly came anxiety - not only for the wounded President but for the country itself . As citizens all over the U.S. and indeed around the world waited for the medical bulletins , questions formed : Did , and would , the U.S. still have a functioning Government ? Could decisions still be made , necessary actions be taken , while a President in office little more than two months , barely enough time to get his hands on the levers of power , recovered from the attempt on his life ? <P> Fortunately , the answer came before the worries had time to blossom . It was a resounding yes . <P> In the worst hours of uncertainty and confusion , while Ronald Reagan was unconscious in surgery , the nuclear button was right where it should be , in the hands of Vice President George Bush . On his flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a military aide carrying the Vice President 's version of the " football " - an unremarkable black leather case containing top-secret signal codes and military target information . <P> Reagan , once he shook off the effects of anesthesia , resumed some of his duties . The morning after the shooting , with a tube still in his nose and a needle dripping intravenous solution into his arm , the President signed a bill canceling an increase in dairy price supports that otherwise would have gone into effect the next day . The only sign of stress : <P> his signature was a trifle shakier than usual . <P> With Reagan 's approval , Bush presided over two Cabinet meetings , carefully taking his accustomed seat and leaving the President 's chair empty to symbolize the temporary nature of his enhanced authority . The Vice President also conferred with Netherlands Premier Andreas van Agt and Polish Deputy Premier Mieczyslaw Jagiel-ski , who had come to Washington to see Reagan . <P> The Senate passed , 88 to 10 , a budget resolution cutting spending for fiscal 1982 by $36.9 billion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At week 's end Secretary of State Alexander Haig took off , on schedule , for a trip to the Middle East , and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger left for defense consultations with Western European allies . Altogether , the week 's official activity appeared to justify the phrase that Reagan 's aides were using while the President was still in the recovery room : " Business as usual . " <P> Well , almost . The day-to-day operations of the Government will continue about the way they would if the President were in the White House-as in fact he might be this week , if his recovery proceeds on course . <P> TIME Contributing Editor Hugh Sidey , who has been reporting on Washington for 24 years , notes that calm prevailed during Dwight Eisenhower 's several hospitalizations , Richard Nixon 's phlebitis , and even in the far graver crisis of the Kennedy assassination . Says Sidey : " We have sometimes overplayed the difficulty of running the Government . <P> National trauma we have had . But the postal clerk still comes to work , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more diligent in their duties , realizing that the country needs a special effort .
