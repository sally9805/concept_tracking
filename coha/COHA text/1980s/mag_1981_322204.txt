During the furor over President Reagan 's remarks , Leonid Zamyatin , a member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and an adviser to President and Party Secretary Leonid Brezhnev , met in Moscow with TIME Moscow Bureau Chief Erik Amfitheatrof and TIME editors . At one point he speciously compared the presence of 85,000 Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan with the approximately 400 American military advisers in Egypt . But he mainly talked about the threat of nuclear war , angrily denying the validity of Reagan 's comment that the Soviets believe a nuclear war would be " winnable . " Excerpts from the interview : <P> <P> On limited nuclear war . Secretary Brezhnev has just declared that the Soviet Union has no intention of being the first to use nuclear weapons . That rules out a pre-emptive strike . Why should n't the U.S. respond with a similar statement ? Such a statement would do much to calm the very tense atmosphere and allay fear . None of us will be forgiven if nuclear weapons are ever used . We rule out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , whether supposedly limited or unlimited , it will be difficult to tell the victor from the vanquished . We 're not advocates of a strategy of preventive war , and we 're not looking for a nuclear duel with the U.S. We want to return to businesslike cooperation , reduce the level of confrontation , including the nuclear area . Yet we ca n't sit idly by and do nothing when one great power accuses another of a policy of limited war . If the U.S. insists on an arms race , all right . Maybe we 'll be put to the test . We will endure it . But we assure you , America will not attain superiority . <P> On Reagan 's statement that the Soviets think a nuclear war might be winnable . Please convey this to your President . He appears , as Secretary Brezhnev says , to be confused by his advisers when he claims that among themselves the Soviet leaders are considering a first strike against the U.S. Privately or publicly , they have never said any such thing . They are saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There exists a fear of nuclear confrontation here and in Europe , and it has been heightened by your President 's statement that Europe might become a battlefield for tactical nuclear weapons . In America , people are less sensitive to these matters than in Europe and the Soviet Union because World War II was fought over here . <P> On the state of Soviet-American relations . They have never been worse in recent times . The principal reason is that the Reagan Administration is embarking on a course of seeking confrontation with the Soviet Union . We often hear that perhaps American policy is not yet fully formulated . I think that is not so . There is a policy , and it is one of open anti-Sovietism backed by a spiraling of the arms race . Hardly a day goes by without some new invention about Soviet foreign policy , not just by the U.S. press but by officials of the Government . Frankly , we 're tired of refuting these inventions . I just hope they will exhaust themselves . We hope that at some future date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fore again .
