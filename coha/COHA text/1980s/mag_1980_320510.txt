His government survives , and autonomy talks resume <P> The Knesset had convened only a few minutes earlier to debate a measure of some consequence : a motion by the small ( sixmember ) opposition Shai Party to dissolve parliament and hold early elections . At the horseshoe-shaped Cabinet table , Prime Minister Menachem Begin , 66 , complained to colleagues that he suddenly felt warm . He mopped his brow with a handkerchief and loosened his tie . When Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin asked him if he was all right , Begin weakly replied : " Get a doctor . " <P> After leaving the chamber unobtrusively and locating the Knesset 's physician , Yadin returned and led Begin to the Prime Minister 's office . At first Begin insisted he wanted to stay and take part in the vote , but colleagues assured him there was no need . As he waited for the ambulance to arrive , Begin joked with friends , but then appeared to be in pain . He told Cabinet Secretary Aryeh Naor , who had been hospitalized with a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Now I 'm going in . " <P> At Jerusalem 's Hadassah Hospital , where Begin shared an intensive-care room with five other heart patients , doctors confirmed that the Prime Minister had suffered a slight heart attack . They said he should remain in the hospital for two to three weeks , followed by two weeks of further recuperation at home . Despite his history of heart disease-including a major heart attack in March 1977-they predicted that he would be ready to resume his full duties after that . In fact , said ah aide , " we have been assured that he will be able to return to his usual twelve-to 18-hour days . " <P> Begin 's latest illness came at a time when the Prime Minister had seemed to be in unusually good health and spirits . The resignation of his Defense Minister , Ezer Weizman , in late May had seemed to galvanize his determination to save his tottering government . Begin 's speeches had thereafter been notable for their feisty and aggressive tone . " I feel terrific , " he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stayed up late at a bar mitzvah party for a friend 's son . <P> Begin 's collapse seems to have spared his government the full heat of criticism , at least for the moment . During the surprisingly low-keyed debate on last week 's motion , opposition speakers emphasized Israel 's domestic problems : a current inflation rate of 133% , a 500% increase in the cost of living since Begin came to power in 1977 , a huge foreign debt and a soaring emigration rate . But then the Knesset defeated the opposition 's call for elections by a vote of 60 to 54 . Neither Weizman nor former Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan supported the government ; Weizman stayed away , after telling newsmen he was going fishing , and Dayan voted with the opposition .
