In a speech to some 500 generals and Defense Ministry officials summoned <> <> Excerpts from speech , page A7. <> to the Kremlin , the Soviet leader accused the United States of pursuing a foreign policy of " adventurism , rudeness and undisguised egoism. " // Perhaps by coincidence , Mr. Brezhnev spoke on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the day in 1962 when Nikita S. Khrushchev bowed to President John F. Kennedy ' s demands for the dismantling of Soviet missiles in Cuba . Mr. Khrushchev ' s retreat left Soviet generals vowing never again to be caught short of military strength in a confrontation with the United States . <> <> Brezhnev Seeks to Assure Army // Most of Mr. Brezhnev ' s speech dealt with assurances that the Soviet leadership recognized the need for military strength and was prepared to commit the necessary resources. // He said that , while the Soviet Union continued to stand for detente , it recognized that " not only words " but military strength were needed to deal with what he called the American threat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combatreadiness of the Soviet armed forces and for an upgrading of military technology. // His speech also marked an explicit Soviet use of the " China card . " For months Soviet leaders have been calling for an end to the deep-seated ideological and territorial disputes that have divided Moscow and Peking for two decades . After a break of three years , the two sides resumed talks in Peking earlier this month and agreed to continue them in the two capitals . <> <> Connection With U.S. Policy // Previously , the Soviet Union had called for improved relations with China as a goal in itself . Today , Mr. Brezhnev made an explicit connection with the strained Soviet-American relationship . He said United States policy had made Soviet relations with other nations " very important , " and he mentioned specifically China. // In a passage that suggested that the Soviet Union was not discouraged by the first phase of the renewed talks , he noted that the Chinese leaders , too , had expressed interest in closer ties. // " Of no small importance are rela-tions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normalization of relations with that country and are doing everything in our power toward this end . In Peking , they also say now that normalization is desirable. // " No radical changes in the foreign policy of the People ' s Republic of China are to be seen so far . But the new things which appear must not be ignored by us. " // Both Chinese and Soviet officials said after the Peking talks that they expected no early resolution of the differences between the two nations. // The unusual nature of the Kremlin gathering , and Mr. Brezhnev ' s assurances of backing for the armed forces , suggested that the party leadership was seeking to ease concern in the military that responses to the United States had not been tough enough. // This interpretation was strengthened by a new emphasis in Mr. Brezhnev ' s remarks . In previous speeches during the 21 months of the Reagan Administration , the main theme was generally the importance of detente and of restoring an equilibrium through arms negotiations , trade and other contacts. // This time there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two sets of nuclear arms reduction talks under way in Geneva , on strategic , or long-range , weapons , and on medium-range weapons in Europe. // Instead , there was a strong hint in Mr. Brezhnev ' s remarks that a Soviet freeze on the deployment of medium-range missiles might be abandoned soon if American preparations for the deployment of equivalent missiles in Europe were to continue. // Western diplomats said that , while the change in tone owed something to the fact that Mr. Brezhnev was addressing a military audience , it also implied a stiffening of the Soviet posture. // " The masses of people on all continents , " Mr. Brezhnev said , " angrily protest against Washington ' s aggressive policy , which is threatening to push the world into the flames of a nuclear war . The adventurism , rudeness and undisguised egoism of this policy arouse growing indignation in many countries , including those allied with the U.S.A. " // The occasion had implications for Soviet domestic politics . Diplomats could not recall a previous occasion when a Soviet leader felt obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speech contained a passage in which Mr. Brezhnev , who is 75 years old and in failing health , appeared to be trying to scotch rumors that he was no longer in command. // In the presence of five other members of the ruling Politburo - including the two men favored eventually to succeed him , Yuri V. Andropov and Konstantin U. Chernenko - Mr. Brezhnev noted that Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov , " constantly reports " to him about military matters . His words slurred , he added : // " I also constantly handle matters of consolidating the army and navy in the performance of my official duty , so to say , and know about the state of affairs. " // Some of the solutions to economic problems , including increased investment in agriculture , appear to have created anxieties in the military about a budget squeeze . But Mr. Brezhnev , who has gained a reputation in 18 years as a Soviet leader for giving the armed forces almost everything they want , promised that they would be getting even more in the future. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced weapons and military hardware , " he said . " The party ' s Central Committee is taking measures to meet all your needs. " // It was at this point that he indicated concern that the Soviet forces were falling behind in military technology . " Competition in military technology has sharply intensified , often acquiring a fundamentally new character , " he said . " A lag in that competition is inadmissible . We expect our scientists , designers , engineers and technicians to do everything possible to resolve successfully all tasks connected with this. " //
