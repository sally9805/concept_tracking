For 20 days during July 1944 , the West 's financial leaders worked on a plan for a postwar world economic order at the rambling Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods , N.H. The international money system they developed in that spectacular White Mountain setting was so successful that ten years after its collapse , some economists and politicians still long for a return to Bretton Woods . <P> The dominant figure at the 1944 conference was John Maynard Keynes , then 61 , the leader of the British delegation . Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau led the U.S. contingent , but the real American architect of the Bretton Woods accord was Harry Dexter White , Morgenthau 's plain-spoken chief adviser . <P> Working in the cool mountain air , Keynes and White agreed to create a system of fixed exchange rates . The established currency values could be adjusted , but in practice that rarely happened . The value of the dollar was set in terms of gold at $35 per oz . Moreover , the U.S. promised to redeem all dollars held by foreign governments with gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies was set in terms of the dollar , and countries were obliged to maintain the value of their currencies . If the French franc suddenly dropped below its assigned price in dollars , for example , the French government had to push the price back up by buying francs on the foreign exchange market . <P> The Bretton Woods arrangement worked smoothly for some 20 years , but by the late 1960s it was coming apart . The problem was that large American balance of payments deficits , caused by factors that ranged from rising U.S. imports to hefty outlays for foreign aid and the Viet Nam War , were creating a huge dollar glut abroad . By the end of 1970 , foreign countries held some $36.4 billion in dollars , far more than could be redeemed out of U.S. gold reserves , which had slipped to just $11 billion . <P> President Nixon dealt a death blow to Bretton Woods in August 1971 by cutting the link between the dollar and gold and allowing world money markets to set temporarily the dollar 's value . Four months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 8.57% dollar devaluation , an action Nixon called " the most significant monetary achievement in the history of the world . " But in February 1973 the U.S. devalued again by 10% , and its allies responded by letting their currencies float freely against the dollar . The Bretton Woods era of fixed exchange rates was over .
