Take my word for it , this is going to be one of the best years for Olympic losers . Indeed , as a group , they will be more exotic than the winners , more glamorous and probably more charming and definitely better for belly laughs . // In one sense  --  a mathematical sense  --  any Olympics is almost entirely about losing and losers . Figure it out . Roughly 1,750 competitors are entered in the Calgary 1988 Winter Games , but there are only 96 gold medals to be awarded  --  and only 35 of those are individual medals ; the rest are duplicate golds awarded in team sport events , like the 30 golds set aside for the winning hockey team . It requires only simple arithmetic to realize that when the Olympics are over , there will be more than 1,600 losers  --  or that losers will outnumber winners by a ratio of roughly 17 to one . // But there are losers and there are losers . Many Olympians in Calgary will be defeated by close , respectable margins . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes ; athletes who competed with the firm conviction that they really had a chance to finish No. 1 in their event . For some , a silver or a bronze medal will help to ease the pain of this kind of losing  --  and in Calgary a total of 192 second-and third-place medals will be awarded . And finishing in , say , the top 10 , 20 or 30 will be satisfying for many other expected losers  --  up-and-coming rookies , over-the-hill veterans , your perennial mediocrities , etc. // That is losing . // As for losing , that is done by the hapless and the hopeless , competitors who never in their wildest dreams considered the possibility of coming in first . Or fifth . Or in the top 75% . Yet , in the Olympic Games of the late 20th century , losers can be elevated to levels of attention that even some winners might envy . You see , with losing there is often an inverse  --  to say nothing of perverse  --  ratio at work : The more inept or absurd the loser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may recall that at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo , the press 's favorite loser was a luger who represented Puerto Rico . He was George Tucker , then 36 , an overweight but quick-witted doctoral student at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Conn . When he was introduced by a Yugoslav public-address announcer as " George Turkey , " Tucker murmured to a reporter , " The man knows more English than he lets on . " Tucker told the press that he figured his rate of completions down the luge run without a wreck was about 75%  --  " good for a quarterback , but bad for a luger . " He finished 30th of 30 entries , and he got a lot more press in the States than Paul Hildgartner , the Italian who won the gold medal . // Another ' 84 loser who was given generous quantities of ink and TV time was the Egyptian Alpine ski team , one Jamil Omar Hatem Abdulalem Jamil El Reedy , then 18 , a resident of Plattsburgh , N.Y . El Reedy let it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 days alone in a scorpion-infested cave in Egypt 's Western Desert , enduring a traditional rite of passage that his coach-father insisted upon . El Reedy told the press that he had been frightened of the creatures in the cave but that the experience had been good because " I learned that the only security is in the mind . " He added that he was a little tired of jokers who asked him if he had trained for the Games by sliding down the pyramids . He finished 60th out of a field of 60 in the downhill , 46th out of 47 in the slalom , and failed to complete his first run in the giant slalom and was thus eliminated . // Also among Sarajevo 's momentarily famous losers were Erroll Fraser , a black speed skater from the British Virgin Islands who was 40th of 42 in the 500-meter and 42nd of 43 in the 1,000-meter events ; La-mine Gueye , a Senegalese downhill skier who is a model and actor in real life and finished 51st in the downhill ( 14 seconds behind the winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last in both the slalom and giant slalom ( she was not entered in the downhill ) ; and Lebanon 's four-man ski team , which barely got out of battle-torn Beirut before the airport was occupied by Shiite militiamen and could do no better than a 39th ( of 47 ) in the slalom and 58th ( of 76 ) in the Giant Slalom. // In Calgary there will be a similar assortment of odd and inept Olympians who will attract a similar amount of antihero worship . El Reedy is planning to give Egypt a representative in the downhill one more time , and Tucker will once again be luging for Puerto Rico . // Out of the same odd bag of winter sportsmen who hail from tropical islands comes Jamaica 's bobsled team . It is made up of native-born Jamaicans , some of whom had never seen snow or stood next to an honest-to-god bobsled until August . The team sponsor , U.S. business consultant George Fitch , got the idea that there might be bobsled talent in Jamaica while watching the annual pushcart derby in Kingston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of two-man teams plunging down a steep , winding , mile-long course at breakneck speeds ( up to 40 mph ) in four-wheeled pushcarts which are ordinarily used to sell things like sno-cones and tomatoes along city streets . The leap from careening pushcarts to Olympic bobsleds somehow seemed logical to Fitch , and just months after he saw the race , Jamaica had its bobsled team . Even as you read this , a crew of tough , fast Jamaicans is in Lake Placid making its final training runs . There are other exotic Olympians on the agenda in Calgary  --  e.g. , a bobsled team , skiers and lugers from the Virgin Islands , a cross-country skier from Fiji , Alpine skiers and a cross-country skier from Guatemala , and a luger from the Philippines . // They are more or less the predictable garden variety of abject Olympic loser  --  doughty , slightly weird and fun  --  but they scarcely present a truly great vintage by themselves . No , what will make Calgary ' 88 memorable is the presence of a couple of losers with royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loser princes will be performing for our entertainment . Prince Hubertus von Hohenlohe , 29 , who bears a title that traces its roots to 14th-century Bohemia , expects to ski for Mexico in the Alpine events . And His Serene Highness Prince Albert Louis Alexandre Pierre of Monaco , Marquis des Baux , 29 , will be piloting a two-man bobsled for his homeland on the track at Canada Olympic Park . // Though the presence of two princes in a single Games is unusual , it is by no means the only time royalty has competed in the Olympics . Indeed , an early royal winner participated in the Olympics of 66 A.D. when the Roman emperor Nero entered several events in the Games of that year . Nero was not really much good at anything , but he was accompanied by 5,000 bodyguards and , thus , he won everything he entered . He was judged the best singer , the best musician , the best herald and the best chariot driver , among other things . He won the chariot competition in spite of the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly mashed beneath its wheels . Seeing that the emperor was down , all other charioteers reined in and waited while Nero got into his chariot and whipped his horses back into action . And on to victory . // There have been other titled competitors who have won legitimate gold medals in the modern Olympics : Greece 's King Constantine  --  then the crown prince , now in exile  --  won the Dragon Class in yachting in the 1960 Rome Summer Games ; and Lord Burghley , the sixth marquess of Exeter , won gold in the 400-meter hurdles in the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam . A spirited if eccentric enthusiast , Lord Burghley was a longtime member of the International Olympic Committee , but he eventually became so lame that he could hardly walk , let alone hurdle . After his hipbone was surgically removed , the indomitable Olympian had the bone mounted as a hood ornament on his Rolls-Royce . // Neither Hubertus nor Albert possesses quite such panache . Hubertus is a talented , ambitious pop musician , producer and composer who has made at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handsome prince glides about an abandoned opera house in a series of encounters with mysterious women . He also produced a record last summer called The Rhythm Divine with Shirley Bassey and has had several of his own songs on hit lists in both Austria and Spain . // A straight-talking , humorous young fellow who speaks five languages and is within a written thesis of an Austrian university degree in economics , Prince Hubertus says of his music career , " People see a pretty face and a famous name , and they get the wrong idea . They think just because a man is a prince that he can not be serious about music . I have broken through to the insiders in the business now , and they know that I am real . " // The Hohenlohes are all cousins to the British royal family and there are five or six different branches of Hohenlohes spread out over Europe . Says Hubertus : " We have one duke in the family and everybody else is a prince . They say that ours was n't the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bohemia , others went to Austria . Now our family is living in Spain mostly . " // Spread out or not , a warm nuclear unit the Hohenlohes are not . The prince 's mother , the vivacious Princess Ira von Frstenberg , split from the prince 's father , Prince Alfonso von Hohenlohe-Langenberg , more than 25 years ago . Their marriage in Venice in 1955 , when she was 15 and Alfonso was 31 , was hailed as the Wedding of the Year . Princess Ira 's father was an impoverished Austrian prince , but her mother was a daughter of the superrich Gianelli family of Italy . Alfonso 's family fortune was meager , and soon after the Wedding of the Year the couple moved to Mexico City , where he wound up running a Volkswagen distributorship . Hubertus and his brother , Christof , were born there . // After the divorce , Alfonso moved to Spain with Hubertus and Christof and started the plush Marbella Club , while Ira married , then divorced , the notorious playboy Francisco ( Baby ) Pignatari of Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than His Serene Highness Prince Rainier , father of Prince Albert , are the subject of relentless rumors over whether they are or are not having an affair that could lead to marriage and to two blue-blooded offspring of the same family representing different countries in the Games . // Hubertus learned to ski on family vacations in St. Moritz and eventually became so good that he was an Austrian university downhill champion . He has skied in international competition for several years , including two world championships and the 1984 Olympics , where he finished 38th in the downhill , 26th in the slalom , and 48th in the GS . Still , his skiing has been a basic lark , devoid of the year-round training ordeals that full-time racers endure . " I start training when it snows , " says the prince . " I never train like a madman , but I work pretty hard . If I arrive at the finish of the downhill eight or 10 seconds behind the winner and if I am not exhausted and if the run was not dangerous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Prince Albert is more serious , softer-spoken , gentler , an almost angelic-looking young man with a fine-boned face in which vestiges of his late mother , Grace Kelly , are readily apparent . Although he has wide shoulders and a lithe and wiry physique , there is a sense of frailness about the prince . He seems about as far removed from the traditional image of bobsledders  --  scar-faced , gimlet-eyed , speed-demented daredevils  --  as a concert violinist . Yet Albert is a grimly determined bob driver who in his shy way is proud of what he has already accomplished . " My times at St. Moritz last year were good enough to be in the top 20 if I 'd done them in the world championships , " he said recently . " I 'm getting so I have a sensitivity in my hands , a touch on the steering ropes , that gives me an instinctive feel in my turns down a course . " // Albert has long been almost a compulsive athlete , participating while he was at Amherst College in swimming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis and skiing . " I still felt I was missing something , " he said of his college days . " When I was a boy I had dreams of being in the Olympics , and when the chance arose to be involved in this adventure , I jumped at it . " // His bobsledding began with a tourist 's ride down the St. Moritz run a couple of years ago . " I was a little impressed , " said the prince , " meaning scared . " But he went back again and again , found that the risk of high speeds was enjoyable and , when a Swiss friend suggested that he could train himself up to Olympic conditions , Albert went for it . Qualifying for the Monaco Winter Olympic team was no problem : It consisted of a single Alpine skier who had competed at Sarajevo . Besides , Albert had a fine Olympic heritage . Not only is he the youngest member of the International Olympic Committee but his grandfather and uncle , the two Jack Kellys of Philadelphia , had also competed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single and double sculls in ' 20 and ' 24 , the junior winning a bronze in the single sculls in ' 56. // Prince Albert 's major problem was finding a brakeman-partner for his sled . " I had to find a citizen of Monaco in order for him to be in the Olympics , " he recalled , " but we only have a few people to choose from , and you do n't find many bobsledders on the Riviera . I went to all the sports clubs and finally tested 10 guys . I found two who seemed fast enough and strong enough . " // The prince 's No. 1 brakeman is Gilbert Bessi . He is a 29-year-old croupier at the casino in Monte Carlo who is also a sprinter and was Monaco 's lone entry in the World Track and Field Championships in Rome last summer . // Albert and Bessi have been training with tenacity since August , doing everything from sprint starts to weightlifting to endless practice on the runs at St. Moritz , Igls and Calgary . Ralph Pichler of Switzerland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , witnessed the prince 's first run at St. Moritz and has closely observed his progress since . " I give him pointers , tell him how I drive the specific curves , " says Pichler . " He does what you tell him . But he is not enough of an athlete and he 'll never have fast enough starts  --  not unless he has a gorilla push him . But his declared goal is simple participation , so he is realistic . " // Indeed , simple participation is the declared goal of all of the losers who will appear at Calgary . So when you watch a Virgin Island bobsled zig-zag down the run or an anxious Senegalese snowplow down Mount Allan , remind yourself between belly laughs that you are watching the last true Olympic amateurs.
