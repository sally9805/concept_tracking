TIME New Delhi Bureau Chief Dean Brelis was among the first Western correspondents to arrive in Bhopal last week . His report : <P> There was something eerie about getting there 30 hours after the leak . At the airport there was an air of uncertainty and even fear . Only three taxis were available , and miraculously two photographers and I got one of them . When we told the driver where we wanted to go he uttered one word , " Danger , " to justify doubling the fare we had agreed upon . We accepted instantly . <P> At the factory , dead bodies were still on the ground , being picked up and loaded aboard a waiting truck . Everywhere one turned , people were retching , bent over horribly , racked by violent coughing that brought a red froth to their lips . <P> All the shops in the city were closed , and on every street people were lying in the gutters . They were dead , humped in agonized frozen postures , like birds shot from the sky . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieking at the wild-looking dogs to keep their distance . The dogs growled and waited their chance ; when the vultures swooped away , the dogs would charge in and tear off pieces of flesh . Roaming through the streets , rescuing the dead from the predators , were rifle-toting soldiers of the Indian army , who were joined by volunteer vigilantes carrying long staves . <P> Even so , there seemed to be no motion anywhere . There was a lifeless quiet , and it felt cold even though the sun was shining . It was impossible to escape from death and misery . Little children with haunted , running , swollen eyes told of scampering through the night , with no particular destination , knowing only that the gas was among them and would kill . They asked the soldiers where they could find their parents . The soldiers replied , " Wait here . A truck will be along and take you to the hospital . Everyone will be there . You will find Mummy and Daddy . " The frightened children , violently coughing , their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , it took the children to Hamidia Hospital . More than 350 doctors , 1,000 nurses and 500 medical students were there to treat the people who came wandering in , suffering from the poisonous gas . All 750 beds were occupied , and the grounds looked like a vast , sad encampment , marked by everlasting misery and agony , spread far and wide . <P> Once they had reached the hospital grounds , the victims seemed to faint , collapsing to the ground as if they had walked their final mile . They looked exhausted , like soldiers at the end of a battle . After waiting patiently , often for up to six hours , the victims were treated with civility and tenderness by the doctors and nurses . The army was there too , keeping the human traffic flowing without the usual pushing and shoving . The troops had set up 60 tents , which became instant wards for 20 people each . Some distance away , the army had set up a morgue to which the patrols in the city brought the dead to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial .
