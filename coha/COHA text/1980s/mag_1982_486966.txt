On my first visit to Washington , D.C. , as an impressionable young man , I fell victim to a curious optical phenomenon . After observing most of the Northeast Corridor through the green-tinted windows of the train , I put on my sunglasses as we pulled into town and voiki , the two tints combined to screen out all color , and the city appeared in black and white , as in a newsreel . I fully expected to be met at Union Station by Cordell Hull . That was many years ago , but I have never been able to shake the feeling that Washington is a city without color and , for that matter , a city without any reality at all . Whenever I meet professional Washingtonians , bright young aides and the like , I am like Faust in the Witch 's kitchen : I 'm struck with wonder that these phantoms have acquired weight and depth , and that they dare to mix with real people as if they were real themselves . They have , of course , a different view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said recently to a Washington bureaucrat , interrupting his tedious story of some ministry or other , and was shocked to discover that he felt the same way about me  --  for America is no more real to Washington than Washington is to America . Ward Just 's new novel , In the City of Fear , offers a glimpse into what Washingtonians think about themselves , and ' I am glad to report that I 'm right : They do n't exist . Of course this impression may simply be the result of Just 's middling competence as a novelist , but I 'd rather think not : the book is very much an insider 's account , packed with vacuous aphorisms such as might actually fall from thin , knowing lips well accustomed to the fawning of the Washington press corps . Furthermore one of the characters  --  a President of the United States  --  is based on a real ( or rather " real " ) person , and no doubt some of the others , a Top Adviser and a Foreign Editor at a Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Just 's characters , however  --  the thing that gives them the real tang of truth  --  is that they take Washington so seriously : they even refer to the President 's wife as the First Lady , capital letters and all . Unfortunately , Just has no clue as to how ridiculous such awed expressions sound to ears accustomed to genuine human speech ; he takes the Capital even more seriously than his characters do , and his book will bore to distraction the reader who expects novels to have an appeal independent of their setting . Washington , after all , is simply not as interesting as Ward Just thinks it is . The cast list of In the City of Fear is like something out of Beaumont and Fletcher  --  the titles are more important than the names . There 's the President ( here called , with what I pray is novelistic license , " the Man " ) , his Top Adviser , the Editor , a C.I.A . Man of Many Faces , a Congressman , a Power Broker , a Colonel and various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his Top Adviser , wants the Colonel to head up a special C.I.A.-inspired operation in Vietnam ( that typically Washingtonian incursion into the breathing world is in full swing during most of the novel ) . However , the Colonel went slightly nuts during a previous tour in Nam , and the Congressman has recourse to the Power Broker to quash an investigation into the Colonel 's antics . This act is given added piquancy by the fact that the Colonel has been a lover of the Congressman 's Wife for lo these many years . This simple tale , told mainly in tortuous flashbacks during a 200-page dinner party ( better think twice before accepting that next invitation ) , amounts to nearly the whole action of Ward Just 's novel . Clearly it is a plot only a Washingtonian could love , so deeply imbued is it with the fraudulent mystique of the Nation 's Cap . The rambling , thinky language in which each action and reaction is laboriously analyzed is another example of Washington self-love , and the aphorisms in which these analyses are presented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novel 's principal reason for being . In the City of Fear is thus a peculiarly frustrating book , a Henry James-style snoozer where a Balzac thriller would be welcome . Still , the aphorisms that fill the book are sometimes shrewd and to the point , especially when they touch on the unique vacuousness of the Federal mind . " in Washington we are all feds , " says the C.I.A . fellow , " neither more nor less . Prejudice owing to creed , religion , or fortune , does not exist , perhaps because the federal culture is stronger than any other . " Sounds good , though fortune is perhaps the wrong word here , since one of its meanings is " a store of wealth . " Wrong words plague the book , however . Here is a string of maxims about the Editor that is typically ill-constructed : " It was not often that he possessed knowledge contemporaneously with the President of the United States , and at a point in the story before the climax . In Washington , knowledge was power but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , only that one had it . It was knowledge of weaknesses and strengths , mostly weaknesses . Weakness determined strength and was therefore the more important knowledge . " This sounds weighty , if you abandon your mind to it . But what , really , is being said ? Once you know something that the President knows ( e.g. , time of day ) you always know it contemporaneously with him , unless , as is likely with our current Chief Exec. , it has already passed out of his mind . Also , he does n't mean contemporaneously ; he means synchronously or simultaneously . Sound and sense are rarely seen together in Washington , I know , but in a Washington novel one hopes for more insight and less rhetoric . Really , Just should get out of town for a couple of decades . Jerome Doolittle 's The Bombing Officer is another book with Great Events in the background , but this time the events  --  the bombing war in Laos  --  have not mesmerized the novelist , who gives a coherently plotted , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's slow descent into disillusionment . Doolittle labors to make the adventures of his hero , Fred Upson , a microcosm of the whole sad story of the American involvement in Laos . The wan Fred is transferred from Morocco to Vientiane to take up the duties of bombing officer , the State Department 's overseer of the Air Force 's efforts to . . . to . . . do whatever they were trying to do . The honest American falls in love with his gentle , spontaneous Laotian housekeeper , Somchan , even though neither speaks a word of the other 's language , but 0 , their prelapsarian idyll is brought to a close by military and diplomatic brutality . Just as the harmless Laotian peasants are bombed , and the blameless Plaine des Jarres is pulverized , so the hapless ( and , truth be told , rather colorless ) lovers are ground down and destroyed . There is nothing wrong with what may be called the novel 's thesis  --  that the horrors of history are often generated by language , while love is essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordless seduction by the maid is resonant and fine . The novel 's greatest success , in fact , comes from the subtle disjunction of the words " American " and " Lao " ; in Doolittle 's hands , phrases like " American Embassy " and " American Air Force " and even " New York Times " intruding on the peaceful daily life of Vientiane , do more than yards of political analysis to establish the doomed nature of the whole Laotian episode . This is a considerable novelistic achievement ; unfortunately , it is the only novelistic achievement in the book . In a word ( and words must be used in literature ) , The Bombing Officer is dreadfully written . Doolittle was a speech writer for Jimmy Carter , and his characters are about as animated as the Great Malaise himself . They also run to the clich  --  d : the drunken , disillusioned press officer is an Irish Catholic ; the noble peasant in charge of relocation is sensitive enough to have studied archeology at Yale ( the very acme , one supposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prose of the book is as flat as the Plaine des Jarres itself , with an occasional crater of overwrought description . Here is Doolittle on the aftereffects of drinking : " His mouth still tasted foul after he finished brushing his teeth . He dug at his palate with his thumb , gouging loose a gummy , brown substance . " Quite a hangover . Here is the political analyst on the Deputy Chief of Mission : " Years ago he put on a mask , with the intention of taking it off once he got where he was going . By now his face has almost grown into the mask , but not quite . " " Upson found the image repellent , " Doolittle tells us . Perhaps . But he must have been the only person in Southeast Asia who had never heard it before . " Weird tears are starting to run down my face . " " They 're looking at me so weirdly . " " I know it 's weird . " " A light green dress that 's so clingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All these " weirds " are from just seven pages of Gordon Chaplin 's Joyride , the story of two American adolescent nitwits and their nitwitted motorcycle journey through Cambodia and Thailand . They are just a few of the " weirds " to be found in the book , culled from seeming hundreds . Granted , the art of novel writing lies partly in capturing the distinctive vocabulary of the novel 's characters . But there are limits to such verisimilitude , and they are roughly the limits of the reader 's endurance . In this case , Chaplin 's first-person , present-tense verbatim reporting of the nitwit mind becomes unendurable by page 9 , when the young hero , responding to a narrow escape from a road accident , tells us , " I try to think about it . " Writers about to use the present tense should try to think about this line before committing themselves to that ham-handed device . Another favorite word of Chaplin 's is " asshole , " as in " why am I an asshole ? " The , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and is Chaplin 's way of introducing the potential homosexuality of the two lads . Yes , he is that subtle a novelist . Chaplin boasts the credential of having worked in Southeast Asia for Newsweek , and his descriptions of Thailand and Cambodia have gotten at least one prepublication rave ( " the feel of the place is almost palpable , " said Publisher 's Weekly in a solecism that should never be allowed to perish ) . But in fact Chaplin 's tame evocations would raise no blue pencils at his formeremployer 's . Here is the entry into Cambodia : " You could cook an egg by putting it in the middle of the road , it 's so the sidewalk . ?
