Boston leaders , whether they be private or public , heads of large institutions , or members of small community groups , must put past housing failures behind them and develop a new partnership to rehabilitate the city ' s abandoned properties . Housing abandonment is not a new problem . More than three years ago , the mayor , the City Council , and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board jointly appointed a commission to examine Boston ' s " pending housing crisis " and to recommend a housing agenda for the 1980s . A year ago , the commission released its report ; and one of its strongest recommendations was that the city develop programs to rehabilitate its vacant property . Despite a unanimous recommendation , little has been accomplished . The housing problem is worse now than it was a year ago . Vacant properties abound in many neighborhoods and , while a year should be adequate time to develop various strategies , city leaders appear to be doing nothing except waiting for a panacea . Unfortunately , waiting for such panaceas is similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitating its abandoned properties on anything more than a token level , it must form a new partnership with the private sector and the community . An opportunity to develop and test the feasibility of such a partnership currently exists in the South End . Here , the Boston Redevelopment Authority owns about 18 multifamily buildings and some vacant land suitable for new construction . Rehabilitated , the structures can provide about 125 units of housing . New construction on the vacant lots may possibly triple that amount . While the Authority has advertised the buildings for a potential mixed-income development , housing developers have been unable to meet the income restrictions while paying today ' s high interest rates . A partnership is needed . Essentially , this approach calls for the city , the private financial institutions , and the South End community to agree upon a set of objectives for the rehabilitated properties . Then , in conjunction with an existing state program , the city and the private financial institutions develop their own financial subsidy for the project . Next , the South End community joins the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who best fulfills the objectives the three entities previously agreed upon . Finally , once the program is operational , the financial institutions assume the bulk of the program ' s administration . Ironically , the key to this approach is what many perceive to be the doom for the South End as a mixed-income neighborhood - the adjacent $350 million Copley Place commercial development . Financed in part with an $18.8 million Federal Urban Development Action Grant ( U-DAG ) , developers of the $350 million commercial complex must repay the grant to the City of Boston . The repayment schedule to be completed within 27 years or less , begins with an estimated 1982 payment of $429,000 , increases annually , and reaches $750,000 by 1987 . By using a portion or all of the U-DAG repayment in either a loan or a grant to the project , the city can create its own financial subsidy program . A grant has the advantage of providing a greater subsidy to the project . However , as a loan is repaid , the city is assured of a perpetual source offunds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city can increase the impact of its funds by using them in conjunction with Massachusetts Home Finance Agency ' s ( MHFA ) bonds . Essentially , MHFA floats tax- exempt state-backed bonds to be purchased by the city ' s financial institutions . Since the institutions evaluate the bonds as they do any other business enterprise , and are compensated accordingly , they do not lose money by participating in the program . The U-DAG repayment funds combined with the bond revenue will create adequate subsidy for private developers to build a mixed-income development . Along with the city and the financial institutions , the South End community must also join the team and reassess its plans for the area within the constraints of today ' s economy . In light of budget cutbacks , previous " commitments " for subsidies may be impossible to fulfill . Given existing fiscal conditions , a totally subsidized development is probably infeasible . Emotional attachments to a specific parcel may endanger the feasibility of an entire project that could provide much needed community housing . With the community on board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate proposals submitted by private developers . The committee selects the most suitable proposal on the basis of previously agreed criteria . As all three entities are involved with the selection , none of them will shoulder the blame if future complications occur . Finally , as the city has traditionally been wary of such projects due to their sizable administrative costs , this approach asks the private institutions to assume the bulk of the administration . Financial institutions are experts at measuring risk , evaluating loans , and determining fiscal feasibility . As they already have adequate staffs to assume this role , their doing so will have the desirable effects of protecting their investment and lessening staffing requirements for a hard-pressed city and state agency at little or no increased cost . Should the partnership succeed in the South End , it can be tried in other neighborhoods with a significant number of vacant buildings . By 1984 , the city is expected to get an estimated $600,000 from Copley Place and two additional U-DAG projects . By 1986 , a fourth project will begin its repayment ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of $999,300 from four U- DAG projects . If at least a portion of the repayments become part of a revolving housing fund , it could continue to provide a needed catalyst for innovative programs .
