The high-priced bidding now under way for some of the nation ' s largest consumer products companies illustrates the value of such well-known brand names and the gamble that some investors are willing to take to control them. // While established products are by no means invulnerable , companies increasingly think that names like Kraft in cheeses or Parkay in margarine are their most valuable assets , more so than factories , real estate or even employees , analysts , executives and other experts say. // Once a brand-name product like a Kraft cheese or an Oreo cookie - especially a market leader - has become familiar to the consumer through advertising and repeated use , its sales tend to remain healthy even during economic slumps or periods of corporate mismanagement. // A study of 30 product categories by the Boston Consulting Group found that of the brands that were No. 1 in their category in 1930 , 27 are still No. 1 . Among them are Ivory soap , Campbell ' s soup and Gold Medal flour. // " With an established brand name , the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman , an analyst at Paine Webber Inc . " You can ' t kill a strong brand franchise. " // Because they are confident that their targets ' brands will generate a steady flow of cash that can be used to repay debt , the companies , managers and investors bidding for three huge food companies - RJR Nabisco Inc . , Kraft Inc. and the Pillsbury Company - think they can safely borrow huge sums to finance the deals , analysts said. // They are also confident because those companies have mastered the complicated art of exploiting household names . For all their popularity , brand-name goods still do not sell themselves . The continued success of a product like Miracle Whip rests on the deft deployment of ad campaigns , supermarket promotions. packaging and even delivery trucks. // The healthy corporate appetite for brand names also means that bidders think they can count on selling parts of their targets ' businesses for top dollar if they need cash to repay debt . RJR Nabisco ' s Del Monte fruit and vegetable business , for instance , could fetch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidders also appear to be betting that there is untapped profit potential in the established brands marketed by those companies , some experts said . In all three cases , bidders have offered large premiums over the values placed on the companies by the stock market , at least partly in the belief that they can expand the business by putting the brand names on more products , extending the brands into new markets and creating economies of scale in distribution. // " The brands are underleveraged in terms of the number of product categories on which the brand names can be used , " said John A. Quelch , a professor of business administration at Harvard University ' s Graduate School of Business Administration . " The brands are also undervalued in the way in which the names are used in markets around the world. " // Making better use of existing brand names has been the single most common strategy among consumer products companies in recent years . Coca-Cola , which used to be a single product , is now available in diet , caffeine-free , " new " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coke name . Tide detergent in its powdered form gave birth to Liquid Tide . The Jell-O name is now on puddings as well as gelatins . <> <> A Crowded Marketplace // To a large extent , the increasing value of existing brand names is a function of how difficult and expensive it is to establish a new name in a marketplace so crowded that there is not room on the supermarket shelf for all the brands. // Pepsico Inc. ' s Frito-Lay division introduced Cool Ranch flavor Doritos snack chips two years ago and had an immediate hit . The new flavor has added $200 million in retail sales to a well-established brand name that was already doing $1 billion in annual sales . But when the company test-marketed a new product several years ago with a name no one had heard of - Sunchips - the product never caught on. // " We know , having invested in trying to develop new brand names , that our existing brands are worth a heck of a lot , " said Dwight Riskey , Frito-Lay ' s vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coups in recent years was Frank Perdue ' s success in attaching his name to uncooked chickens , a product that had never been sold by brand name . Selling with a brand name is so much more profitable than selling without one that companies are constantly searching for ways to establish brand names in new areas . ( Advertising , page D19 . ) Skepticism on Brand Names Some marketing experts , however , think the possibilities for squeezing further profits from established brands are limited . Companies sometimes risk diluting the strength of an established name by spreading it over too many products , they said . And in many cases there is little evidence that a familiar name helps improve a new product ' s chances of success. // " The use of an existing name does not bring much to the party , " said John Philip Jones , a professor of advertising at Syracuse University. // The potential for improving a brand ' s sales in international markets is also open to question . In some cases a product ' s performance can clearly be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the academic and business worlds over whether many products can be effectively marketed the same way around the globe. // Marketing experts also said that the strength of brand names is in danger of being eroded by the growing amount of money being spent by many companies on cents-off coupons and other price promotions and a corresponding decrease in advertising expenditures . Promotions , they said , encourage consumers to buy on the basis of price and erode the brand loyalties and images built up at great expense through years of advertising . <> <> Takeover Targets ' Prized Names // Still , the allure of established consumer products is proving strong to some of the nation ' s most astute investors and executives. // RJR Nabisco , in addition to Oreos and Del Monte fruits and vegetables , sells Ritz crackers , Planters peanuts , Milk Bone dog biscuits and A-1 steak sauce , as well as Salem and Winston cigarettes . RJR Nabisco said last week that some of its top managers , along with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , were considering offering $17. 6 billion to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , the investment firm Kohlberg , Kravis , Roberts &; Company entered the bidding with an offer of $20. 3 billion. // Kraft , in addition to its Kraft cheeses , sells Parkay margarine , Philadelphia Brand cream cheese , Miracle Whip toppings and Velveeta cheeses . The Philip Morris Companies , which owns the General Foods Corporation as well as the world ' s largest tobacco operations , has bid $11. 5 billion for Kraft. // Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. , a British conglomerate , bid $5. 2 billion for Pillsbury earlier this month . Pillsbury sells Poppin ' Fresh dough products , Green Giant vegetables , Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Van de Kamp ' s frozen foods , in addition to owning the Burger King restaurant chain . <> <> Pillsbury Seen as Less Attractive // Pillsbury is viewed by most analysts as a less attractive acquisition than RJR Nabisco or Kraft because relatively few of its brands dominate their categories . Kraft ' s mainstay products , including cheeses , Parkay margarine , Miracle Whip and Lender ' s frozen bagels , are all the top sellers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pillsbury ' s bake mixes , for example , trail mixes from the Procter &; Gamble Company ' s Duncan Hines and General Mills Inc. ' s Betty Crocker in market share. // Category leadership is important because No. 1 brands tend to be considerably more profitable , analysts said , and they enjoy marketing advantages. // " The economics of branding are such that the leader has a substantial advantage over No. 2 , " said William Burnside , a vice president in the Los Angeles office of the Boston Consulting Group. // Second- and third-place brands tend to spend more on advertising per unit than leading brands , advertising executives said , cutting into profitability . Mr. Burnside said that No. 1 brands also benefit from having more room and better placement on supermarket shelves , because retailers give the best display to best sellers. //
