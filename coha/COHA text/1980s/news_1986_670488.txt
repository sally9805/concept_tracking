In " Wild Honey , " an heiress , Anna Petrovna , has fallen on hard times and her family estate is imperiled with foreclosure . Outside the gates is the rising middle class , as represented by a boorish merchant . By the time of " The Cherry Orchard , " Anna Petrovna , still glamorous , has aged into Madame Ranevskaya , and the merchant has become Lopakhin . As in all of Chekhov , a doctor drinks and ignores his patients , officers live on old memories and fall asleep in the middle of conversations and servants see far more than they are credited with seeing . Under a burdensome cloud of ennui , everyone is waiting for someone else to do something . In this case , everyone looks to Platonov for excitement. // As Chekhov matured , his characters refrained from histrionics . Farce was replaced by comedy emerging more from character , and people were less prone to philosophize at length , although they never stopped saying how bored they were . In his early plays , Chekhov was not yet fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through indirection . In his adaptation , Mr. Frayn has the double obligation of keeping the youthful freshness of the work while removing the awkwardness of Chekhov ' s apprenticeship. // In order to understand the progression of the play from discarded manuscript in Chekhov ' s time to the Michael Frayn adaptation on Broadway , I looked at three published scripts : David Magarshack ' s unabridged translation , entitled " Platonov " ; Alex Szogyi ' s abbreviated translation , produced Off Broadway in 1960 as " A Country Scandal " ; and " Wild Honey . " The first is impossibly long and discursive , a full four acts and five scenes . Mr. Szogyi brings the play down to manageable performance length while following the structure of the original . In his ending , Platonov is not shot ( as in the original ) , but dies of fright . The version is broad to the point of being farcical . With boldness , Mr. Frayn has served both as translator and adapter , excising minor characters , shifting scenes and locations and rewriting both the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place in Platonov ' s schoolroom-home . The Frayn finale , neither homicide nor fright , is more dramatic as well as more symbolic . Platonov is less a manipulator than a victim of circumstance. // In contrast to previous translators , Mr. Frayn is himself an accomplished playwright as well as a Russian scholar . The language flows , as it does in Mr. Frayn ' s own plays - although the territory is far removed in style as well as content from that of " Noises Off " and " Benefactors . " Just as Tom Stoppard has demonstrated a kinship with the work of Arthur Schnitzler , Mr. Frayn has an affinity for the Russians - Tolstoy as well as Chekhov . The tone of " Wild Honey " is Chekhovian , with a Frayn comic twist . For this transformation , Mr. Frayn has had two close collaborators , the director Christopher Morahan and the actor Ian McKellen , both of whom were involved in the production at England ' s National Theater as they are in the current Broadway incarnation at the Virginia Theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are no clues as to the look of Platonov and there is little indication of his behavior on stage . Mr. McKellen , with the help of his director , has had to fill in his own comic portrait. // Platonov is a great distance from the actor ' s other notable characters . Although in New York Mr. McKellen is know largely for his performance as Salieri in the Broadway " Amadeus , " in England he has played a galaxy of great Shakespearean roles ( Hamlet , Macbeth , Coriolanus ) as well as appearing in plays of related periods , such as " The Duchess of Malfi . " As diverse as his roles are , so many of them have a dignity and a sobriety ; they are kings , princes , warriors and men of court . He has specialized in plays with a tragic consequence. // Many of his peers , fellow claimants to Lord Olivier ' s classical acting crown , have been more insistent about varying their choices . Derek Jacobi alternates " Cyrano de Bergerac " with " Much Ado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern play . Michael Gambon shifts effortlessly from Lear and Galileo to Simon Gray and Alan Ayckbourn . Alan Howard plays the king and then spoofs himself in comedies like " Wild Oats . " Mr. McKellen , however , is most often seen in period costume , doing battle with weighty classics - and , as he demonstrated in his one-man show , " Acting Shakespeare , " he is a most authoritative and articulate expert on the art of classical acting . When challenged , he readily reveals his versatility - as the anguished husband in David Rudkin ' s " Ashes , " as an oppressed homosexual in a Nazi prison camp in the London production of Martin Sherman ' s " Bent . " Some years ago , he played the title role in " The Wood Demon " ( at the Brooklyn Academy of Music ) . It is in that absurdly comic performance as an idealistic poet and painter that we can find the genesis of his Platonov. // The first decision on the part of Mr. McKellen and Mr. Morahan was to play this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance , he looks as if he has moved too precipitously from sleepless night to sybaritic day . He scratches his head , yawns and slouches . Exuding irresponsibility along with seedy charm , Mr. McKellen ' s Platonov is a clown and an actor in life . He amuses himself by being antisocial - it is his means of survival - and no matter how badly he behaves , women adore him . He is the most dynamic man in town , a fact that testifies to the dreariness of the town itself . Like Lear ' s Fool , he does not censor his opinions , issuing insults up front rather than behind one ' s back. // Mr. McKellen so splendidly captures Platonov ' s roguishness and his mocking self-criticism that he wins our allegiance ; poor fellow besieged by so many beautiful women . Through his performance is revealed the character ' s deep malaise . The pleasures are evanescent and his appetite for excess is insatiable . Toward the end of the evening , the friend whom he has cuckolded bemoans his own misery , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aimed at Mr. McKellen , the word " everything " is a piercing lance . Wounded by the charge , he looks as woeful as a pallbearer ; the reaction provokes one of the play ' s heartiest laughs . His " everything " is in such total chaos. // For the Broadway production , the play has been recast largely with American actors . The staging does not have the seamless unity of the National Theater original . Several of the older male characters blend into the background , but the women are vividly individualized by Kathryn Walker , Kate Burton and J. Smith-Cameron . Miss Walker plays Anna Petrovna , an emancipated woman who stirs up all the men just as Platonov stirs up all the women . In a romantic play , the two would flee the provinces together . Because this is a Chekhovian comedy , an entirely different fate awaits them , arrived at after an evening at once mirthful and melancholic. //
