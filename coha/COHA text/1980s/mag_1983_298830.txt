A coup ! Wait , no ! <P> Tuning in to Radio Free Grenada for an afternoon earful is usually about as much fun as listening to a hinge squeak . The broadcast , courtesy of the Marxist-led government of the minuscule Caribbean island ( pop . 110,000 ) , is chockablock with monologues about evil Yankee imperialists and the marvels of socialism . Not last week . <P> Shortly past noon on Friday , the station began amusing listeners across the Caribbean with hot flashes about coups and countercoups . First came word that Prime Minister Maurice Bishop 's security chief was under arrest for alleging that two Cabinet ministers had tried to over throw the government . But wait . Then the station announced that Bishop , 39 , had been deposed by his Finance Minister , Bernard Coard , also 39 . No , hold on . Now Coard was resigning so he could clear his name of the " vicious rumor " that he and his wife Phyllis had plotted to kill the Prime Minister . <P> Whatever was really going on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even to the participants . Callers to the Prime Minister 's office were told that staff members were sorry , but everybody was too tied up in meetings to come to the telephone . In another bizarre twist , charter flights into Grenada were politely informed that sure , they could land , as long as they were not carrying any Grenadians as passengers . Most islanders were too muddled by the proceedings even to choose sides . <P> The reports did confirm what citizens had been gossiping about for months : not only were the charismatic Bishop and the brilliant Coard intense rivals , their wives were barely on speaking terms . More serious matters also might have been at stake . Last month Bishop accepted a $14.1 million loan from the International Monetary Fund . Some factions may have suspected Bishop of agreeing to tone down his socialist rhetoric in exchange for the money , particularly after Bishop 's closed-door meetings last spring at the U.S. State Department with a group that included National Security Adviser William Clark . <P> The squabble marked the first open split among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1979 with only 40 men and a handful of creaky weapons . At the end of last week came the humiliating news that the People 's Revolutionary Army would step in to restore order . What happens now ? Tune in next week , same station .
