When there were too many ashes to fit ( meaning that you had failed to empty the cans recently ) , you dumped the rest into a bushel basket standing nearby . This had a tendency to burst into flame , so you squirted water on it from a handy garden hose . That in turn created a great clqud of fine white ash , which . covered everything , including yob in your school clothes . There was an iron rod called a poker , five feet long with a loop handle at one end and a 90-degree bend at the other , with a point . When you got a clinker , a hard chunk of residue that stuck in the grates , you had to pick the furnace 's teeth , blundering down through the bed of hot coals with the poker .

I suppose they were for the train to blow smoke through , but as far as I was concerned , nobody ever used them except to throw snowballs at . Our dog liked coal . He would steal a lump from the cellar and lie out on the lawn chewing it . On a winter night I could see hiM there , nearly covered by snow from the blizzard , contentedly worrying his piece of coal . He preferred egg coal . One autumn I used some old orange crates for kindling to start the furnace . Eventually the wood ashes were shaken down along with the coal and spread on the driveway .
