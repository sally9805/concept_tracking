Not many Americans were both awake and tuned in to CNN , the all-news cable-TV network , early Saturday morning . <P> But those who were saw something that had never appeared on U.S. screens before : a Soviet leader conducting a press conference in Moscow , live . It was not exactly American-style-the questions were mostly written , not shouted by reporters-but it was close enough to arouse feelings of dj vu . The Kremlin apparently wanted to make the maximum publicity splash for its official reply to President Reagan 's Euromissile proposals . So the Soviet foreign ministry began notifying reporters on Wednesday , hours after Reagan had stopped speaking , that Andrei Gromyko , the U.S.S.R. 's Foreign Minister , would meet with them at 11 a.m . Saturday , Moscow time . The timing presumably was calculated to win big headlines in U.S. and European Sunday newspapers . <P> Scenting a scoop , CNN headquarters in Atlanta had its Moscow bureau chief , Stuart Loory , ask the foreign ministry if the conference would be televised live , an extremely rare event in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought time on a satellite to hook into the telecast . The Soviets supplied two feeds : one for the picture and sound in Russian , the other for a rendition in English by a Soviet translator . Cost to CNN : $15,000 . <P> About 300 Soviet and foreign reporters , including TIME Correspondent John Moody , were waiting when Gromyko strode into the ministry 's press center with a jaunty step that belied his 73 years . He delivered a 65-minute speech , then answered a dozen questions . Speaking without notes or a prompting device , Gromyko came across as thoughtful , worldly and more humorous than his nickname , " Grim Grom , " would suggest . Insisting that British and French missiles must be included in any agreement limiting warheads in Europe , he asked what would happen if they were launched against the U.S.S.R. : " Will a French missile have a stamp on it , ' I am French . I was not to be taken into account ? ' " When Loory inquired what effect his promotion last month to the additional post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gromyko deadpanned : " I think I can say the Foreign Minister will not have less work to do . " It was an act that the Great Communicator himself might applaud .
