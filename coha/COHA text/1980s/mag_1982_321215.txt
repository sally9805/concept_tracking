Twenty-one years before I was born , an event took place at the home of then Secretary of State John Hay that was later to confront me with the most difficult political battle I had ever faced , including my long campaign for President . On the night of Nov. 18 , 1903 , a treaty was signed in Washington between the newly proclaimed Republic of Panama and the U.S. No Panamanian had ever seen the treaty , the terms of which were highly favorable to the U.S. Acting for Panama was a French businessman , Philippe Bunau-Varilla , whose authority was doubtful and who had not even visited Panama in 18 years . <P> The treaty was ratified under Bunau-Varilla 's threat that the U.S. would withdraw its protection from the new republic and sign an alternative agreement that would effectively terminate Panama 's existence . It was never clear whether John Hay or President Theodore Roosevelt concurred in this remarkable warning . The result of this act was the construction by the U.S. of the Panama Canal within a ten-mile-wide strip of land extending from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering achievements of all time and a boon to the seagoing nations of the world . Within the Canal Zone , our country was granted in perpetuity " all the rights , power and authority . . . which the U.S. would possess and exercise if it were the sovereign of the territory . " <P> From the outset , Panamanians deeply resented this denial of their authority over part of their territory . That they retained ultimate sovereignty over the Canal Zone was clear from the treaty . Still , some Americans , including some members of Congress , maintained that by granting the U.S. perpetual authority over the Canal Zone , Panama had given away sovereignty as well . <P> During the 1976 presidential primaries , Ronald Reagan accused the Ford Administration of maintaining a " mouselike silence " in the face of " blackmail " from Panama 's " dictator , " General Omar Torrijos . Reagan repeatedly used a line guaranteed to get applause : " When it comes to the Canal , we built it , we paid for it , it 's ours and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it ! " Reagan 's position appealed to many Americans because he presented the issue , simplistically , as a test of our nation 's power and greatness . <P> Nevertheless , I came to believe that a new treaty was absolutely necessary . I was convinced that we needed to correct an injustice . Our failure to take action after years of promises under five previous Presidents was poisoning our relations with Panama . In addition , though we could not talk about it much in public , the Canal was in serious danger from direct attack and sabotage unless a new and fair treaty arrangement could be forged . Our military leaders came to tell me , and also testified to Congress , that the Canal could not be defended permanently unless we were able to maintain good relations with Panama . The commanding Army officer in the Canal Zone estimated that it would require at least 100,000 armed men to defend the Canal within a hostile environment .                    @
