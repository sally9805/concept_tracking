Wayne Williams is convicted of two Atlanta murders <P> The verdict was swift and harsh . " We the jury find the defendant Wayne Bertram Williams guilty on count number one ... guilty on count number two , " said Foreman Sandra Laney , a cable television worker in Atlanta , after the jury had deliberated only eleven hours . Williams , who had managed his own radio station at age 16 and gone on to become a failed music promoter and freelance photographer , was , at 23 , a convicted killer . Surrounded by four sheriffs deputies who have guarded him since the trial began last December , Williams stared silently as Judge Clarence Cooper sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences for the murders of Nathaniel Cater , 27 , and Jimmy Ray Payne , 22 . <P> Cater and Payne were two of the victims in a string of 29 apparently related strangulations and knifings of young blacks in Atlanta . That epidemic of killings terrorized the city for 22 months and prompted the wearing of green ribbons around the nation as a symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the murders . With his arrest last June , after one of the most extensive police investigations in U.S. history , the deaths came to an end . <P> Williams has consistently protested that he is not the killer . " I maintained all along through this trial my innocence and still do so today , " he told the judge after hearing of his conviction . " I hold no malice against the jury , the prosecutors or the court . I hope the person or persons who committed these crimes can be brought to justice . I wanted to see this terror ended . I did not do it . " Faye Williams , who had testified during the trial that her son was " a fun-loving 100% American boy , " was less forgiving . She called Judge Cooper an Uncle Tom and charged of the jury that " all they wanted to do was go home . " Said she of the trial : " It was a setup from beginning to end . " <P> The case against Williams was an ever tightening web of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 197 witnesses and examined 728 pieces of evidence . Robert Henry , a gardener , said he had seen Williams walking hand-in-hand with Cater two days before Cater 's body was found floating in the Chattahoochee River . Police say that , shortly after a splash was heard , Williams was spotted driving slowly across a bridge not far from where Cater 's body was found . A.B . Dean , 80 , the last person who reported seeing Jimmy Ray Payne alive , said Williams was with that victim too , a few days before Payne 's body was dragged from the river . <P> But the most important elements in the prosecution 's case throughout the trial were damning shreds of evidence . Among them : green fibers and dog hairs found on the bodies . Those materials were said to be similar to the carpet in Williams ' bedroom and the hair of his German shepherd Sheba . Last week the defense tried to show that the carpet in question was purchased in 1968 , three years before the type of fiber found on the bodies was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan document indicating that the carpet was bought in 1971.
