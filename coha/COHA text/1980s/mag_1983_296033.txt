It 's spring again . And look what the Easter bunny has brought all the way from France : Daddy 's illegitimate son . Product of a mad moment a decade ago , little Jean-Claude arrives wearing a heavy coat of wistfulness atop his natural Gallic charm . His mother , you see , has died of Segal 's syndrome ( named after the author of Love Story , in whose calculating and sentimental mind this new imposition first arose ) , and all that stands between the lad and orphanhood is Bob Beckwith 's willingness to do the decent thing by getting his wife and daughters to accept the boy . The issue is never much in doubt , since Martin Sheen plays this humanities professor as if his subject were actually humanitarianism . As the wife , Blythe Danner does her customary turn as the best thing about a bad mess . But even her tart realism can not rescue this movie from its sappy source .                    @
