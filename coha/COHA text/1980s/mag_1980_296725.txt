Using the space shuttle to " bury " radioactive wastes <P> As the poisoning of Love Canal painfully shows , the problem of ordinary chemical pollution is horrendous enough . But potentially worse is the dilemma of how to dispose of radioactive wastes . Though countless schemes have been proposed for sealing the deadly stuff deep within the earth , few people seem willing to live on or near such a " hot " burial ground . Now scientists are suggesting another idea : banish the nuclear-age garbage to far-off space , using NASA 'S shuttle as a kind of celestial dump truck when it finally flies , probably early next year . <P> The space option for nuclear waste is not exactly a new idea . It has long been apparent that the safest incinerator for such material would be the nuclear fires of the sun . But solar burial has one overwhelming drawback : sending a rocket spiraling into the sun with a nuclear cargo would require extremely high speeds and prodigious amounts of fuel , as would the alternative of sending it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , is more accessible , but contaminating that pristine surface would surely create an international furor . Nor would public concern be less if the debris were left circling the earth , with the potential of becoming a nuclear Skylab . <P> Yet there may be a safe and acceptable nuclear depot in the heavens . Three space engineers writing in the journal Astronautics &; Aeronautics suggest parking the dangerous debris in an orbit far from any living thing , midway between the earth 's own path around the sun and that of the neighboring planet Venus . Left there , say Claude Priest and Robert Nixon of NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center and Eric Rice of the Battelle Laboratories in Columbus , it would never come closer to the earth than 22.5 million km ( 14 million miles ) . The scheme would also be cheaper than sending the waste into the sun . Best of all , say the engineers , the garbage would remain locked in its orbit for at least a million years . <P> They admit that their brainstorm has some shortcomings . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous fission byproducts could be considered for launch . They would also require almost foolproof packaging-probably a hardened mix of metals and ceramic encased in stainless steel spheres . As a precaution against a crash during lift-off or in the early stages of the journey , the spheres would be carried in an aerodynamically shaped container with heat shielding . That would enable them to survive a fiery plunge back into the atmosphere without spreading radioactive debris round the earth .
