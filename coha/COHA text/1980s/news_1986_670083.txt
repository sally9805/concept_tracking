Here is this week ' s quiz for all you students of checks and balances . Production begins on a TV documentary about Africa . Much of the funding is from U.S. taxpayers  --  the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , the Public Broadcasting System , the National Endowment for the Humanities and a private foundation working through CPB . This establishment gives birth to a nine-hour TV show whose narrator keeps saying things like : Moammar Gadhafi " used oil as an opportunity , for the glory of Africa as well as Islam . " " American bombs dropped from the air kill children as surely as terrorist bombs left at airports . " Africans " expose themselves to Western Shylocks in search of a pound of flesh . " The question : How does such a transformation of values happen ? For the advanced class , here is a harder one : How does this happen even though Groucho Marx ' s four-year-old child could have told you there would be a public outcry ? The program in question is , of course , the PBS series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The idea for the show began at the BBC . The show ' s writer and sole narrator , Ali Mazrui , from Kenya , teaches political science at the University of Michigan . His schooling , like the origin of his TV series , was mainly British . His B.A. is from the University of Manchester and his Ph . D. from Oxford . Mr. Mazrui is no political cipher . He has published articles , participated in symposiums and belonged to organizations with political concerns . He has written sympathetically of the idea of " counterpenetration " of the First World by the Third , including placement of Third World laborers in industrialized Europe in conditions " exploitative in the short run and potentially revolutionary in the years ahead . " Writing about the Mideast , he characterized the then-ruler of Uganda : " Idi Amin , so unpredictable in a variety of ways , " set a precedent in breaking relations with Israel . The BBC asked Washington ' s WETA-TV to co-produce the series featuring Mr. Mazrui . Charles Hobson , WETA ' s executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not think much about Mr. Mazrui ' s politics . " Ali ' s critics in Africa , " Mr. Hobson said , " come from the left , " because Mr. Mazrui is no Marxist . More important , said Mr. Hobson , " We didn ' t think of him as an active political person at all . " The producer elaborated : " The idea of his politics and ideology never occurred to us . " This is how the show ' s larger politics were handled on the American side . The show applied for money from NEH , which can not fund " projects examining issues of current controversy without the balance of competing perspectives . " The show made it past peer review and then-chairman William Bennett . " It was hard to tell from the application " that the product would be so extreme , said someone in the NEH process . The producers did promise " balancing " devices that never showed up in the final series . The application treated subjects like the Arab slave trade in measured tones quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this application gave off strange signals . It said Mr. Mazrui would ask " Who is an African ? " of " Muslims and whites . " It delved into whether Africa would be more powerful with nuclear weapons . NEH ears did not prick up . This is no surprise . Dissembling usually goes on when people who think themselves creative must submit to the indignity of asking the government for money . After a while a bureaucrat ' s ears lose their sensitivity . When current NEH chairman Lynne Cheney saw the series this August , some in the Endowment said it would be too embarrassing to make such a late fuss . Ms. Cheney saw it differently . " The roof would have fallen in , " she said in a recent interview , " if we hadn ' t said something . " So she took the Endowment ' s name off the series . Officials connected with the show struck , " they ' re going to be disappointed . " Another vice president said , " It was never meant to be a travelogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underneath " The Africans ' " gorgeous pictures and offensive lines is the view that Africa is in misery because of the West . This thought is not new to the U.S. public . It has come at us out of the United Nations for over a decade . African leaders are now speed-walking away from it . U.S. public discussion can absorb lots of this toxic waste without keeling over . The deeper problem is public-TV types who won ' t admit anything went wrong . Public-TV advocates have tried strenuously to protect freedom of expression in a government-funded system . They have succeeded . Politically speaking , no one is in charge . This is mostly a good thing . There is a certain far point , though , at which television insults people so frontally that it would be not tolerant but decadent of them not to ask why they are paying money for the abuse . All we can rely on to prevent such clashes is the good judgment of the TV officials themselves . When they respond as they have done here  --  when they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say that critics of the show could only have wanted " good news " or a " travelogue , " when they do not see why explaining to the U.S. about its moral equivalence with Col. Gadhafi has crossed the line  --  they are asking for enemies . They can defend " The Africans " with what they consider brilliance and be digging their own grave.
