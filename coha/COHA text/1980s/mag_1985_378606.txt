It was billed as " Style Wars " and " Tea and Empathy . " Nancy Reagan , the polished Southern California socialite , and vivacious Raisa Gorbachev , the uniquely style-conscious Soviet First Lady , were advertised as going coiffure to coiffure in a well-scripted spate of public relations appearances while their husbands went eyeball to eyeball over substance behind closed doors . In fact , while the women generated little real warmth in private discussions , they nevertheless displayed a dignity that transcended the much hyped designer-dress face-off . Pressed by a reporter about style-wars comparisons , Nancy Reagan aptly retorted : " I really think that 's a little silly . I mean there are very important things being discussed here , and what somebody wears or does n't wear really is n't terribly important . " <P> Maybe so , but it was clear that both sides had paid elaborate attention to precisely such details . The news blackout that cloaked the two principals focused for a while more scrutiny , if possible , on their wives , who dutifully worked their way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely unknown and more unpredictable , attracted particular journalistic interest , and she did not disappoint , peppering her hosts with rapid-fire questions and spontaneous comments . At the University of Geneva , Raisa , a Ph.D . in Marxism-Leninism who has lectured in Communist theory at Moscow State University , startled the rector by engaging him in a conversation about the relationship between philosophy and physics . At a clock museum , she jokingly inquired whether one ceremonial item was a Swiss watch ; the director sheepishly admitted it was French . Raisa Gorbachev also demonstrated a beguiling bilingualism . Fingering a jeweled antique timepiece , she displayed it to U.S. television camera crews and warbled in accented English , " It 's bea-u-tee-ful . " <P> The contrast between the two First Ladies was most evident at an afternoon tea staged by Nancy Reagan at Maison de Saussure . The experienced American First Lady , 64 , confidently sat back in her chair as the flock of photographers swirled around , strobes flashing ; Raisa Gorbachev perched anxiously forward at the edge of her seat . When the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawing-room version of their husbands ' fireside summit discussions , the hostess serving a flavored beverage , Celestial Seasonings Almond Sunset tea ( $1.69 for 24 bags ) , which she had carried along from the U.S. Raisa Gorbachev gamely claimed she enjoyed the tea . Later White House aides said that Nancy had found Raisa somewhat pedantic and inflexible . <P> In other appearances , both women acquitted themselves well . Raisa Gorbachev remained unflustered when heckled loudly by a Soviet migr outside the Geneva city hall . Nancy Reagan momentarily lost her train of thought while conversing with addicts at a drug treatment center but recovered and launched into a warm pep talk . In a joint appearance at a Red Cross ceremony , Nancy Reagan carefully read a prepared speech ; Raisa Gorbachev had largely memorized hers , impressing the audience with the resulting sincere eye contact . At a second tea party , this one given by an increasingly confident Raisa Gorbachev at the Soviet mission and featuring caviar and blini , the two First Ladies briefly held hands as they posed for photographers .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
