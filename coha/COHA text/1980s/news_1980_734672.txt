txt WHEN THE Airline Deregulation Act was being sold to Congress in 1978 , its proponents promised it would reduce air fares . They also noted that the only major passenger airline supporting the bill was Chicago  --  based ' United Airlines , the nation 's largest . United , many other airlines complained , would use deregulation to gobble up its smaller competitors . IN THE YEAR and a half since the industry had its regulatory bonds loosened , however , not everything that was predicted has occurred . ? Airline fares are up considerably . The one-way coach seat irom , Chicago . to Kansas City that cost 558 Jan. 1 , 1978 , now costs $98 , 65 per cent more . ? United had difficulty recovering from its 58-day strike last year , losing nearly 6100 million in 1979 and $48.9 million during the first three months of this year . ? The prime beneficiaries of deregulation appear to be the commuter airlines , which have continued to expand into markets the big airlines find impossible to serve profitably with jets . SINCE DEREGULATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston , W.Va. ? , Asheville , N.C. ; Chattanooga , Tenn. ; Merced , MOdesto , Bakersfield , Visalia , and Stockton , Cal. ; Salem , Ore. ; and Muskegon , Mich. // // United also pulled out of Atlanta and New Orleans . In most of those smaller cities , United service was replaced by commuter airlines . The commuter airlines industry grew by 18 per cent in 1979 , Civil Aeronautics Board officials said . In fact , the commuter airlines now carry about 40 per cent of all air passengers an trips of 200 miles or less and 57 per ? ent of all passengers traveling lessVian 150 miles by air , CAB figures show . ON THE SURFACE , It would appear as if the Airline Deregulation Act has been less than successful , but CAB Chairman Marvin S. Cohen said that is not true . Despite the steadily climbing regular airline fares , the special discount fares offered by the airlines resulted in savings of several billion dollars by air travelers , $2.5 billion in 1978 , Cohen said in testimony May 20 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by United to lure its customers back after its strike last year and the airborne lottery it conducted for free round-trip tickets this spring would have been impossible under the old heavily regulated climate , airline officials said . About ' 21.8 per cent of United 's revenues came from discount fares in 1977 , the year before deregulation . Last year . revenue from discount fares accounted for nearly 35 per cent of the total . Revenues from full fares last year accounted for about 41 per cent , down from 55 per cent in 1977 . ? EVEN THE STERNEST critics of deregulation have conceded that its first year ( 1978 ) was relatively successful . The airlines carried 274 million passengers and made a $1.2 billion profit doing it . The return on investment was a relatively healthy 13 per cent that year . Last year was a different matter , however . Despite carrying a record Mt million passengers , the industry as a whole posted a profit of only $409,000 , according to the Air Transport Association , the industry 's trade organization . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net losses of a staggering $250.5 million while the locals lost $19.4 million , " Cohen said . " While first-quarter losses are a common phenomenon in this industry , they come on the heels of heavy loses in the fourth quarter and precede what appears to be a substantial drop in traffic for the current year . " THE MAJOR CULPRIT was a nearly ? 00 per cent jump in the price of jet fuel , CAB economists said . Fuel , which accounted for 16 per cent of the industry 's operating costs in 1978 , accounted for 30 per cent of the total In 1979 and has since reached 34 per cent . United officials estimated that it cost that airline $20 million a year for every penny increase in the price of a gallon of fuel . Some airline officials said that the fare flexibility made possible by deregulation enabled them to cope better with the Skyrocketing cost of fuel by raising prices immediately instead of waiting for a fare hike request to crawl through the CAB regulatory machinery . ' Although the CAB began bowing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago lawyer , and started loosening its regulations , the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act mandated changes in the way the industry could raise and lower fares as well as enter and pull out of routes . It also made it easier for new airlines to be certified by the CAB to increase competition . No. chart THE STEADILY increasing price of Jet fuel since the first oil crisis in the early 1970s made it Inevitable that . the trunk airlines , with big jets. ? would pull out of shorter routes , industry officials said . It was also inure effective for the big airlines with high overhead costs to consolidate their operations . The average trip length for trunk airlines , less than 800 miles in 1974 , exceeded 854 miles last year , according to Air Transport Association figures . The trunks ( United , American , Delta , Eastern , Trans World , Continental , Western , and Northwest ) have increased the average by pulling out of shorter routes and adding longer routes , While United was pulling out of the smaller cities , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition with Eastern , Delta , and Northwest , and plans to add flights from Chicago to Houston , Phoenix , and Tucson . In Ft . Wayne , Ind. , United dropped its three daily flights to Chicago , but kept service to Denver . American added service between Chicago and both Dallas and Seattle in a market dominated by United . THE DEREGULATION ACT also allowed airlines to raise fares by 10 per cent and lower them by 70 per cent below standard coach fares . That has resulted in steadily increasing coach fares on some routes at the same time the airlines are slashing faresion highly competitive routes . That accounts for the fact that travelers could get a $99 budget fare from Chicago to Los Angeles in a market in which United , TWA , Continental , and American were fiercely competitive but had to pay $279 for a trip of approximately equal lehgth to Seattle , a market dominated by United .. The fares of commuter airlines , which have replaced the major carriers in many markets , also vary widely . A CAB survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fares were either equal , to or below the standard airline fare , 23 per cent ranged up to 15 per cent above the standard fare , and 12 per cent were nearly one-third higher . COHEN BELIEVES deregulation should continue . " What we have ' done is create some risks , " he said . ' But these are no different than exist in the private sector in general , " Deregulation is a two-way street . The public has already saved huge sums of money . Let us now give the industry a chance , " he added . Conventional wisdom among airline industry analysts is that the industry will continue to lose money during 1980 but that things should begin to look up by the end of the year .
