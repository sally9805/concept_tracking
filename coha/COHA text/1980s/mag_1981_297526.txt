A TOWN LIKE ALICE <P> PBS , Sundays to Nov. 8,9p.m . <P> For decades , Australia 's chief entertainment export was raw talent . The land of English immigrants was a billabong from which promising young artists , actors and singers lost little time in emigrating . Then , out of government grants and an informal consortium of gifted newcomers , there emerged an Australian film industry , which in the past decade has become the world 's most vital national cinema , extravagantly creative , fiercely indigenous . <P> Now , some of those same film makers are bending their energies to improving the quality of Australian television , and programs from Down Under have started showing up in the U.S. The astringent soap opera Prisoner : Cell Block H broke the ice in 1980 , but with the cleaver of melodrama . Then the mini-series Against the Wind , a saga about the settling of the Australian frontier , won critical applause and respectable ratings in syndication . No question ; the Aussies were coming . With A Town Like Alice , the six-hour drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have arrived . <P> It is quite a pedigree of raves and ratings that Alice brings with her . In Britain this summer , the series scored with the critics and drew an average of 30% of the audience , close to the record set by Roots and Holocaust . Back home it was something of a national event , averaging 70% of the audience in most major cities , and going as high as 75% in Adelaide . <P> Based on Nevil Shute 's 1950 novel , the script by Tom Hegarty and Rosemary Anne Sisson begins in Malaya in 1941 . An English typist named Jean Paget ( Helen Morse ) is 20 and moseying through a life of blissful boredom on a cricket pitch when the Japanese invade the country . <P> They force the women into an aimless odyssey , trudging on blistered feet from one village to another . Many die ; all lose their imperial hauteur . But Jean shows her spine and sinew , arguing with her captors , keeping order in her depleted ranks . She is man enough for every adversity-and woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raffish Aussie ranch hand whom she meets on the road . Joe is strong , abrupt , resourceful , a right charmer who falls for Jean but will not make a move because he believes her to be married . After the Japanese catch him stealing some chickens for Jean and the other women , Joe is tortured and left to die . <P> This is the story Jean relates , back in London after the war , to an aging solicitor ( Gordon Jackson ) who is surprised to find himself in love with this remarkable woman . He will help Jean and hinder Joe as they try to re-establish contact over the years and across the British Empire . <P> Made for $1.4 million , Alice looks as handsome as any Heaven 's Gate ( with location shooting in London , Malaysia , Australia and New Zealand ) . At times , Producer Henry Crawford and Director David Stevens linger indulgently over this spectacular sunset , that dramatic moment . Alice might have had twice the impact at half the length . But there are rewards for its attenuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable actors .
