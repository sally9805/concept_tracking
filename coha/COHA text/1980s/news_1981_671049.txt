So many successful young playwrights have lived , worked or been trained in the state that they have come to be called the Texas Mafia . Two of their plays have won Pulitzer Prizes for drama in the last four years , including Beth Henley ' s " Crimes of the Heart , " which took the 1981 award . Her play was a hit with the critics when it opened on Broadway last month. // All of this activity and success has prompted some Texans to proclaim a renaissance of letters in their state . At the very least , they say , there is a new literary ferment , just as Texas itself has become an expanding mixture of new peoples , values and ideas in a rapidly changing social atmosphere . Such a setting , they say , can produce not only the material of fine literature but the talent to write it as well. // // Criticism From Texas Writer // Of the Texas writers of this era , some critics say the best known is Larry McMurtry , the novelist who wrote " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hud " and " The Last Picture Show " were based . So he was taken very seriously when , in a stinging criticism of the state ' s literary efforts , Mr. McMurtry asserted flatly that " there are as yet no solid achievements in Texas letters " - his own work included. // In an essay published in The Texas Observer , a biweekly magazine , Mr. McMurtry contended further that Texas writers as a group were guilty of intellectual laziness for failing to break out of a " country-and-western " genre that ignored the rich material and emerging character of urban Texas . The state ' s literature , he wrote , is " disgracefully insular and uninformed " at a time when its urban scene requires a Balzac or a Dickens . But no Texas writer , he says , has so far equaled even Philip Roth , Norman Mailer or John Updike. // It has been two months since the publication of the McMurtry essay , which stunned many of the author ' s friends and colleagues and angered some . But after a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the rueful conclusion that Mr. McMurtry was basically right. // But , they say , some qualifications are needed , especially since he did not include playwrights or nonfiction writers in his assessment . <> <> ' A Great Period Is Being Wasted ' // " A great period is being wasted , " Mr. McMurtry contended in his article , because Texas is undergoing the kinds of social transitions on which fiction thrives , and its cities are developing the " dense , intricate social networks " that stimulate and sustain artists . " But , " he concluded , " until Texas writers are willing to work harder , inform themselves more broadly and stop looking only backward , we won ' t have a literature of any interest. " // In a recent telephone interview from Washington , where he runs a bookstore and is working on a new novel set in the capital , Mr. McMurtry said he did not mean to imply that there were few talented and dedicated writers working in the state , or writers molded by their Texas experiences . Nor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were incapable of consistently producing first-rate literature. // He said , however , that Texas ' s literary product fell short when compared against the verities . " I think it ' s inevitable " that the state ' s writers will produce great literature , he said , " because I think Texas has terrific energy going for it . Given a little more time , a little more education , it will happen , " possibly in the next generation. // Is the idea of a Texas literature valid ? Does it really make any difference ? " I ' m not defending the notion that Texas has produced any great literature , " says A.C. Greene , a Dallas-based author and critic , " but I might turn around and say , ' What state has , except Massachusetts and New York and perhaps California ? ' " Still , he said , Texas is one of the few states whose clearly defined individuality causes outsiders to " attack it as an integrated unit , " in literature and everything else . <> <> Attention Paid by Outsiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing is one problem authors here face , says the Dallas-based writer C.W. Smith , president of the Texas Institute of Letters , the main literary society for writers in the state . He says that he basically agrees with the tough assessment by Mr. McMurtry , who is a member of the institute , as are most of the writers named in his article. // Mr. McMurtry asserted in his essay that readers insisted that Texas writing deal with the Texas of the rural past . Similarly , Mr. Smith said , publishers demand that writers deal with the Texas myth , and the writers , responding to the marketplace , have been passing back to the publishers " whatever stereotypical cliches they have about us. " // Mr. Jenkins , with his droll new book about Texas , " Baja Oklahoma , " falls in this class , he said . " The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas , " the Broadway musical based on a story by Mr. King , is considered another example. // Unfortunately , said Mr. McMurtry , and others agree , this dwelling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . <> <> Less Rigorous Standards // Mr. Smith , Mr. Greene and others agree with Mr. McMurtry that the critical atmosphere within Texas is lacking , with its writers being held to less rigorous standards than they might be . In his article , Mr. McMurtry said that was one reason for his strongly worded criticism. // " I ' ve concluded that nothing short of insult moves people in Texas , " he wrote . " In these parts the critical act has never been accepted , much less honored . " The result , he said , is that Texas writers as a group have become self-congratulatory and selfprotective and that the Texas literary scene is " a pond full of self-satisfied frogs. " // Some of Mr. McMurtry ' s colleagues in Texas concede that his broad knowledge of the state ' s literature qualifies him to speak with authority , but they do take issue with some specifics. // For example , he defined Texas writers as those who have grown up in the state or lived here long enough to have soaked up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high quality . Thus , he excludes a number of well-known migrants who write about Texas , such as Max Apple , who lives in Houston but grew up in Michigan . <> <> Nonfiction Writers Excluded // And his exclusion of such nonfiction writers as Thomas Thompson , the author of " Blood and Money , " and such playwrights as Miss Henley and Donald Coburn , the Dallas-based author of " The Gin Game , " which won a Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1978 , rankled many. // But perhaps most eyebrows are being raised over Mr. McMurtry ' s treatment of Katherine Ann Porter . The author of " Ship of Fools " misses greatness , he argues , because her style is " purified almost to the vanishing point , " making her writing elegant but inscrutable . " The plumage is beautiful , " he wrote , " but plumage , after all , is only feathers. " // According to Mr. McMurtry , only one Texas writer comes close to consistent excellence , Vassar Miller , a relatively little-known lyric poet from Houston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several fiction writers , such as Mr. Jenkins , Edwin Shrake and Gary Cartwright , as " journalists " whose books , while witty , lacked the " long rhythms " of the novel and therefore suffer as long fiction. // " I don ' t think we ' re flowing over with Charles Dickenses , " said Peter Gent , the author of " North Dallas Forty , " who was not favorably mentioned in the article , " but there are a hell of a lot of writers working here , or from here , and that ' s the first step. " // Ronnie Dugger , the publisher of the Austin-based journal that printed Mr. McMurtry ' s essay , said , " I think McMurtry did the region ' s arts and letters a considerable service " by " raising the question of universal literary standards in a province that ' s currently mired in mutual admiration.
