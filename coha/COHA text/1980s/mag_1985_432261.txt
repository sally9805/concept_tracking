 | The Soviet Union today is a nation in distress , its people trying to cope with a faltering economy , with promises made and broken by their leaders and with what they are told is a military threat from the United States . It was not always so . Just 25 years ago , a mood of excitement and expectation gripped Soviet society . The memory of victory in World War II still was fresh . The nation had survived Stalin 's bloody purges , his forced industrialization and his brutal collectivization of agriculture . Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin symbolized the new hopes by beating America and becoming in 1961 the first human ever to circle the planet in a spaceship . Nikita Khrushchev was promising that the Soviet Union would outstrip the U.S. economically . By 1985 , he said , housing , midday meals , public transportation , medicine and education would be free and personal opportunities would be unlimited . Most of these promises still are only dreams . Now , a new leader , Mikhail Gorbachev , is trying to prod a sluggish nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet people think about the Communist system and their lives under Communism ? How do average citizens manage ? To find out , Nicholas Daniloff , the magazine 's Moscow bureau chief , who first worked in the Soviet Union 25 years ago , talked with four people who represent a wide range of Soviet society ? a grandmother-homemaker , an artist , a ranking Communist Party official and a dissident Marxist philosopher . His report follows : " I Do n't Know Any Other Life " Klavdia Mikhailovna Petrova , 68 , is a child of the revolution . Like so many elderly Russians , she has lived through it all : Civil war , famine , Stalin , World War II , the cold war , the specter of nuclear war with America . A widow who receives a modest pension , she lives with her grown-up son in a two-room Moscow high-rise . Her husband died in 1979 of a heart ailment . For Mama Klava , as her friends call her , the years of affluence are long gone . They lasted from 1955 to 1961 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food situation here was undoubtedly much better , " she says . " Of course , there were other reasons , too . I remember there was a store ? Gruzia ? on Gorky Street . You could find there all sorts of nuts ? pistachios , almonds , walnuts ? raisins , fruits , wines . A huge selection . " Today , if nuts appear in a food store , there will be immediately an enormous line . As for caviar , you used to be able to buy it easily , and it was much cheaper . After money reform , it became more and more expensive . Today , prices are very high , and you can hardly find caviar at all . " Two world wars left the Soviet Union with a severe shortage of manpower and , like most Soviet women , Mama Klava has worked throughout her life . Today , she says , it is all but impossible for a family to live on a single salary . " Life is expensive , and it 's difficult ? really unthinkable ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family in which the woman does not work . But if a woman did n't work , she 'd go crazy homemaking within four walls every day . So though it 's hard , it 's a psychological relief to go to work . " While many women grumble over having a full-time job as well as keeping house , Mama Klava says men share the housework in most families she knows . " They might not do the washing or other chores that are purely women 's work . But they go to the store to buy food or pick up the laundry . Without that kind of help , family life would be impossible . " Looking back over her own family life , she recalls : " We Promises , Dreams -4 Voices From Moscow 's Streets Away from the Kremlin walls , conversations with a broad cross section of the Soviet people disclose how citizens view their lives under all-powerful Communist leaders .  | never were able to save . We were accustomed to live purely on what we earned . We did n't go in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough to eat , and we clothed ourselves satisfactorily . But there was very little left over for a rainy day . " The Soviet system provides ordinary citizens with several notable benefits ? low-rent apartments , free medical service , access to free education . Still , there are problems . " It 's true medicine is free , " Mama Klava says . " But things are not quite right . In earlier years , you did n't have to take food to your relatives in the hospital . Now , you do , because the food in hospitals has become very bad . " Will the Soviet Union ever become a pure Communist state ? " I have n't the slightest idea , " she says with candor . " As for all the talk about free services , I 'm not a political person , but I doubt that it could happen . It would n't be advantageous to the government . To have such free services , you would have to have a large material base . The Soviet Union has to be on guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . " I did n't live before the revolution . I do n't know any other kind of life . When my tiny brain began to function , I accepted what was around me as the way it ought to be . " I can say this : During the war , people suffered a lot . But they seemed to be kinder to each other . If they had a crust of bread , they shared it with their neighbor . " " We Are Afraid of Doing Wrong " Vlad , a Moscow artist , agrees to talk if his family name is omitted . But he is nervous . He knows that chatting too freely with a foreign correspondent could lead to trouble . " Thank God , I 've had no run-ins with the KGB security police , " he says and then observes wryly : " Maybe after this interview , I 'll tell you more about the KGB . " For Vlad , 38 , life with a wife and three children is complicated . He was denied membership in the Union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he is a member of a trade union , he declines to work as an official painter . Instead , he sells his unorthodox creations privately to individual collectors . Serving tea in a studio crowded with paintings , Vlad tells how he gets by . " I 'm lucky because my dad is a big shot who has served the government well . Soviet big shots have special stores where they can buy all sorts of things , everything they want without standing in line . He sends our way all sorts of necessary things . How other families with small children manage , I simply ca n't imagine . " The Soviet Union suffers a perennial food problem , partly because of bad weather and poor harvests , partly because of bad distribution . Often , store employes carry off the best foods before customers get a chance to purchase them . Vlad sheds some light on this practice : " I should tell you that my mother-in-law works in a grocery store . Through her , I found out what wonderful things really do exist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During her lunch break and after work , she comes home every day with a bag full of wonderful cheap goods . In winter , she can get tomatoes at the official government price of 1 ruble or so . That 's 10 times less than in the farmers ' markets . " We have a number of laws in this country which allow U.S.NEWS &; WORLD REPORT , July 29 , 1985 us to live reasonably securely , though modestly . Our free medicine is our weakest point . In fact , it is terrible . " It 's true that it 's free and convenient . I was knocked down by a truck once , taken to a hospital , cut open and sewed up . I stayed there for two months . I paid nothing . I 'm terribly grateful . No doubt about it . " But on the other hand , the level of surgery is very primitive . Nursing is poor . The hospital food is terrible . People just do n't want this kind of treatment . If you have any savings , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on the side , even though it 's illegal . " My 2-year-old was treated three times in one year for the wrong ailments in one of our district clinics . These district doctors are absolutely incompetent people . It 's not surprising . They have to treat somewhere between 30 and 40 patients a day . So everybody tries to go to a pay clinic . But here there is only one pay clinic for kids . I had to wait in a line there for 4% hours just to get an eye appointment for my child two months in advance . " The conversation turns to artistic freedom and the demands of Communist ideology . " I have full freedom to create , " Vlad says . " For artists , there really are few written censorship rules , except the most elementary that prohibit pictures of Hitler , pornography or anti-Soviet themes . " But you know , because of the Stalin years , we all developed a kind of fear . We worry about our positions . We all are afraid of doing something wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subconscious restraint that enters your flesh and blood . We all have an inner censor , particularly the middle-level managers on whom so much depends . " As to Communist ideology , you might as well ask , What do you think about air ? ' Ideology is like air for us . You ca n't live without it . It surrounds us on every side . We ca n't imagine what life would be like without it . " I am not a party member . In our country it 's not a simple matter . Being a party member opens all sorts of doors to promotion . You ca n't reach certain positions without being a party member . And it brings privilege . Look at my father . For that reason , there are enormous numbers of people wanting to join . They stand in line to join . But not all of them make it . " " You Sometimes Have to Sacrifice Freedoms " " The first thing you must understand about the Soviet Union is that we are trying to create an entirely new form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from the American Revolution . " The speaker is Alexandr Yevgenevich Bovin , 55 , one of the nation 's most articulate spokesmen . Beginning in 1963 under Yuri Andropov , Bovin worked for nearly a decade in the Communist Party 's Central Committee apparatus . Today , he is a member of one of the party 's higher councils , the Central Auditing Commission , and is a leading commentator for the government newspaper Izvestia . He has a reputation for saying what he thinks . " If you look at Western society , " Bovin says , " you see that the driving motor is private property : This is mine . This is yours . And I want mine to be greater . " Not a bad motor , actually . But it seems to me as a Communist , as a Marxist , that this system of private proper- ty is disappearing . Adam Smith would probably roll over in his grave if he could see how capitalism has evolved . Even Ronald Reagan 's attempt to retreat to the 19th century to unregulated , laissezfaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our revolution was to break up this traditional motor of society and replace it with an entirely new motor that will , in the end , produce a more just society . This motor is communal property . Not yours . Not mine . But ours . " A great achievement of our revolution was that it brought security of life to all the people . Here you 'll never be cast out by society . You 'll always have work . You 'll always have a doctor . Your children will always be able to have an education . Here you find confidence in society and in the future . " Bovin speaks with conviction . But he admits that Soviet society is experiencing difficulties with economic development , free education and socialized medicine . There are reasons for this , he says ? the civil war that followed the revolution , World War II , and the postwar years during which the United States " forced " Russia to divert badly needed funds from social programs to military programs . " We are experimenting , " Bovin says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor is not working as effectively as we would like it to . But do n't forget , it has been running for only 70 years ? not thousands of years as Western society has . " He also concedes that the Soviet Union views political freedoms differently than the U.S. " This is one of the eternal problems of humanity ? freedom and order . When you are trying to create a new form of civilization , you sometimes have to sacrifice some freedoms . But little by little this will change . I am sure this will change . We are in a transitory phase . Our society provides enough freedom for individual development . But there are limits . Individual actions should not be directed against socialism . " Bovin is confident about the future . He sees no shortage of ideas for improvement . " If you look at our society over a decade , you will see that things are getting better . Not worse . And for that reason , I remain optimistic . " " There Are Enormous Numbers of Shortcomings " Roy Alexandrovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is also a Marxist who was expelled from the Communist Party a decade ago for heretical views . He offers this summary of the Communist system : " There are major shortcomings in almost all aspects of Soviet life . But from my point of view , the most serious shortcoming is the lack of democracy . There is no opportunity for free expression here , even free expression of Communist ideas . This is an authoritarian system in which decisions adopted today are the only truth . If , for example , a decision is taken to remove a political leader , that 's today 's truth , and there is no possibility to protest against it . " Medvedev 's outspokenness is striking in a society where departure from the party line is considered ill-advised . In the recent past , Soviet authorities have threatened him with prosecution on anti-Soviet charges . His apartment is under 24-hour guard , and foreigners are not allowed to visit him . For this interview , we met in Moscow , but away from his home . Despite official sanctions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaks without hesitation : " In the Soviet Union , it is extraordinarily difficult to put forward new ideas , even within the framework of the Communist world view . There are enormous numbers of shortcomings in the economic sphere . If it were possible to discuss openly and criticize , then you would see talented economists and innovative programs appear . " Medvedev argues that the " real fault " in the Soviet Union is the constitutional provision of a one-party system and the party 's attitude toward freedom of expression . " The Soviet Communist Party does not have to share power , but it must allow an opposition . There could be an opposition within the party , or there could be opposing factions . There should be an open political battle . In almost 70 years , we have not developed personnel capable of working in such an environment , neither at the highest political levels nor at the lowest . The party has turned into a bureaucratic organism . It can not and does not want to live in an environment of free speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm pleased we have a younger leadership , " says Medvedev . " I am pleased that we have a more intelligent and capable man than the previous one in power . I believe that Gorbachev will understand the need for important changes in the levers of economic power . Just how well he will understand it remains to be seen , however . If the economy is reformed , this would have an important effect , because you ca n't change the economy without changing the political situation . I doubt that Gorbachev has thought much about political reform . " Public vs. private needs . Medvedev believes that democratization of Soviet society would have a beneficial effect on relations with other nations . " It is not convincing to me that our country can not be democratized because of the difficult international situation ; look at Hungary , for example . Unfortunately , people who reach high positions in our country find that their personal interests take on primary importance and the state 's interests become secondary . " He says that Nikita Khrushchev was an exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough education . Khrushchev was too impulsive . He tried to reform too fast , and he failed . " The system is bad for outstanding individuals who want to create , to do something out of the ordinary . But for the average person , it gives considerable advantages . " The notion that all people are dissatisfied and that the system is maintained by terror and pressure from the outside is a mistaken impression . The majority of ordinary people here fully supports this system . "
