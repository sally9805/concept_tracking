Kintaro-ame , a traditional Japanese candy cane , is a frequently used metaphor for explaining the policy views of leaders of Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party . Snap a stick of Kintaro-ame in several places and the identical face of Kintaro , a folk hero , can be seen inside . Snap open the position papers of various L.D.P. officials , and they all look the same . <P> Thus when three L.D.P. leaders officially declared last week that they were candidates for the presidency of their party , little attention was paid to their policy papers . Never mind that one of the three candidates will become Prime Minister , succeeding Yasuhiro Nakasone , 70 , when he steps down later this month after five years in office . No , the speculation immediately centered on which of the three  --  Party Secretary General Noboru Takeshita , former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe or Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa  --  will be the best power broker , dispensing promises among the various factions that make up the L.D.P. The winner needs a majority of the 445 L.D.P. members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are any contentious issues dividing us , " said Takeshita . " It will boil down to differences in style . " <P> Differences there are . The front runner is Takeshita , 63 , a cautious political pro who proudly admits building his career on " patience and $ silence . " Diligently executing other men 's policies rather than pushing his own ideas , he is viewed by critics as an unoriginal thinker . Takeshita controls the largest faction in the Diet , with 114 votes , but it is well below the 223 required for victory . <P> Miyazawa , 68 , is as urbane and witty as Takeshita is provincial and dry . A rabbit at negotiating Japan 's bureaucratic warrens , Miyazawa served for ten years in the Ministry of Finance before his 1953 election to the Diet , where his faction now numbers 89 . The favorite among businessmen and government officials , Miyazawa is fluent in English . All his brilliance , ironically , may be a political liability in a country where too much flair and genius , openly displayed , is suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nakasone 's highly visible Foreign Minister from 1982 to 1986 , logging 39 official trips abroad . Open and easy in manner , he is the closest in style to Nakasone , a man who reshaped Japanese politics by being dynamic and forceful . <P> After filing their petitions to run , the three candidates announced that they would meet privately in an attempt to negotiate the choice of Nakasone 's successor among themselves . If that effort fails , L.D.P. members will hold a vote next week . <P> Takeshita and Abe have already cobbled together a fragile union with another faction leader , Toshio Komoto . The trio controls 231 votes , but who the candidate will be , Takeshita or Abe , remains a question . To the delight of Miyazawa , who is fishing for allies , the Abe-Takeshita alliance is rickety . As Abe puts it , " There is only one chair for us to sit in . We ca n't solve the problem with a round of golf , which I would surely win . " <P> The man most eager to break that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to maintain clout once he leaves office . Ever the shrewd politician , he has not publicly declared his choice . Though only a so-so golfer , Nakasone has proved himself a pro at playing the intricate game of politics .
