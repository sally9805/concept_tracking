With Soviet troops in Afghanistan and surrounding Poland , what Americans have to fight against , and find a solution to , is a sense of " inevitability , ominous inevitability " that relations are going to get worse , he says. // " I am not without hope , " he said in an hour-long interview , the first he has given here in 10 months . " But . . . it ' s a much tougher riddle than I expected . . . . Too many people begin to talk of things as they wish they were , rather than as they are. " // On Poland , he said a Soviet invasion would be " devastating " for the world , but that " unhappily , the Western world has very few tools to work with. " // As a prominent former businessman ( board chairman of IBM ) , he warned that doing business in the Soviet Union would never be a " bonanza " for Americans . Business would always be a tool in Washington ' s armory against Moscow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how to use business as a weapon . He opposed selective sanctions that forced businessmen to break existing contracts and expressed sympathy for Dresser Industries. // Dresser has delivered a plant here to make 100 , 000 oil drilling bits a year but has been ordered by the US to cancel a training program that was part of the deal. // Mr. Watson is a tall , gentle , courteous , white-haired man , one of the wealthiest and best-known figures in the US business world . He retired from IBM six years ago. // After the June 1979 summit with Soviet leader Brezhnev in Vienna , President Carter appointed Mr. Watson to Moscow as a symbol of twin US desires : more arms control ( Mr. Watson has chaired a general advisory committee ) and more trade in an era of detente. // But Afghanistan changed everything . For a man already under fire in Washington and in the press for possessing no previous experience in full-time diplomacy , it was a profound shock . The Polish crisis has heightened it . The strain showed in Mr. Watson ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way many attitudes have changed back in the United STates in the past year. // " It took me about eight hours after the first Afghan telegrams last December to realized that all of my abilities . . . at least all of my background , had been preempted , " he said . " I had a kind of a catch im ny throat around here for a couple or three weeks. // " But I had an awfully good deputy ambassador Mark Garrison , and between us we recognized what had to be done here in the way of strng reactions , and I think we cooked up most of the policy recommendations that were finally followed back at home. . . . " // When his friend Cyrus Vance resigned as secretary of state in April , Mr. Watson thought of resigning . His worst moments came as he flew to Washington to say goodbye to Mr. Vance . He contemplated returning to the comfort of his home in Greenwich , Conn. , his summer estate in Maine , his six children , his private airplane and helicopter. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary of state and Mr. Watson was persuaded to stay on . He is glad he did. // " I am terribly glad I have gone through the year , " he said . " I had a lot of help from my wife , as you know . Had I quit halfway through , I think it would have been a disappointment for the rest of my life. . . . // " There have been times when it has been terribly disappointing , terribly lonely , terribly ominous , to be quite frank with you. " // The 15 months here have been a tough period of education for Mr. Watson , a man whose father founded the IBM company and whose previous career was spent in business at the top levels of US society. // Many in the Western community here feel President Carter erred greatly in appointing a nondiplomat as ambassador . Wartime Ambassador W. Averell Harriman reportedly urged the appointment : Harriman was also a nonprofessional when he came here , and also symbolized big business. // Critics of the appointment felt Mr. Watson was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they praise him for his warm human qualities , his devotion to his job , his willingness to learn and to take advice. // Mr. Watson hoped that his service in World War II would help him gain access to Soviet leaders : As lieutenant colonel in the US Army Air Corps , he ferried aircraft to the Soviets during the war for use against the Nazis. // But Afghanistan and the slump in detente meant that even these shared memories had little effect . At one of his first post-invasion meetings with Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , the Russian listened impassively while Mr. Watson spoke of his hopes for peace and understanding , then asked if the American was speaking officially or unofficially. // When Mr. Watson said unofficially , Mr. Gromyko said , in effect , " Then perhaps we can move on to the official part of our meeting . " The tone was cold. // Instead of filling his official residence , Spaso House , with glittering parties , the ambassador had to be content with Soviet officials coming in pairs and repeating endlessly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistani , and Chinese interference  --  the standard Soviet line. // He has enlivened the Western community here with house guests ranging from Bob Hope to Lowell Thomas to Sen. Charles Percy ( R ) of Illinois ( incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ) . But it has been far from what he hoped. // He says he has been " reasonably satisfied " with his access to top Kremlin officials . He has met Mr. Brezhnev at receptions but talked with him officially only once , when he accompanied Senator Percy to a meeting Nov. 26 , 1980 . He has talked with Mr. Gromyko a number of times , and he met Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov with Senator Percy. // Reflecting on his experience here , the ambassador says Americans have a lot to learn about how enduring the Soviet system is. // " We have been consistently expecting this system to grow weaker and go away , " he said . " And it is never going to do that . Deputy Chief of State Vasily Kuznetsov asked me , ' What did you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson ' s first visit ? Did you think we were going to make it ? // " I said that no , I really hadn ' t expected them to . He said , " What do you think now ? ' I said , ' I think you ' re going to make it . ' He said , ' So do we. " // " They will grind on for the foreseeable future as a huge empire , adequate government , with adequate morale so there won ' t be any rebellions. " // What about food shortages and their impact ? // " Yes , food supplies are short , but they are a long way above the bread level , " he said . " They ' ve proved they can go down to the bread level and still survive. . . . " // What can the US , and the West , do ? // " The US has to demonstrate great national will . . . . There ' s no magic formula for presenting national will . It ' s doggone difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional arms . It requires persuading West Europeans . It requires hardening the dollar . It requires balancing the budget , stopping inflation . . . . If you were to ask me what would be the biggest thing the US could do in coping with this difficult relationship , it would be to present a consistently strong demonstration of national will. // " Here , national will . . . is demonstrated by the decisions of the Politburo . . . . In the US , . . . it ' s slow and laborious . We ' re in a difficult position now . . . . There isn ' t going to be any Pearl Harbor or any other incident which will galvanize us together. // The ambassador said the most important message the US Embassy here had to get across in the last year was thorough disapproval of the Afghan invasion . He feels the embassy was successful. // His biggest surprise here was Soviet willingness to commit troops to Afghanistan . He says Moscow was " not precise about it , and they didn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There ' s certainly a possibility that they would go in , and that ' s why we ' re passing the warnings around the way we are . I think it ' s a very dismal thing to observe that the Soviets are reserving to themselves the right to change an internal system of any of their associated countries . . . . They don ' t want an enemy on their borders , but what is being contemplated in Poland , what they ' re worried about , . . . simply changes the way the Poles are going to manage their trade unions . The Soviets are reserving the right to introduce force to change that kind of internal arrangement . . . . Unhappily the Western world has very few tools to work with in reacting to it. " // Mr. Watson spoke with authority on US business prospects here. // The US government had to use all available tools to gain Soviet attention . Business was one of those tools. // But he felt the US government did not speak with one voice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , for eating caviar , for drinking toasts , for cutting ribbons . " Since Afghanistan , " the political side is quite different , it ' s very confrontational. " // If the Soviet Union invaded Poland , Washington might want to cut off all trade . But that should come only in the last resort  --  and the ambassador objected to " trying to select what you should do , giving , a fellow a license , then telling him later that you ' ve reconnsiderd and that you are going to cancel . I don ' t thing that ' ts wise. . . . // " There are three ways of trading with the soviet Union : full and unfettered trade , . . . no trade at all ( and we may get to that if the situation gets bad enough ) , . . . and what we ' ve been trying to do recently , to tread a middle path . . . . But to try to selectively sanctions various types of material her is almost an impossible job . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now. " // referring to the dresser Industries experience of having part of an existing contract canceled , he said , " I would fulfill contracts in this place until we had broken or partially cut off our full diplomatic relationship . A contract is a contract . . . . I feel very sympathetic to the Dresser people. " // The ambassador said the way to use trade as a diplomatic lever was to cut off future contracts , not interfere in existing ones . Or he would agree to all trade being stopped. // As for his personal plans , the ambassador said he wanted to fly airplanes , ski , and " fiddle around with sailboats " for a few months. // //
