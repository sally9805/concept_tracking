For six months a tiny brunet , known to her instructors as Lena Rigon , had been taking helicopter-flying lessons . In reality she was Nadine Vaujour , 34 , wife of one of France 's most carefully guarded prisoners , and she had learned her lessons well . At 10:45 last Monday morning , Nadine flew a rented chopper to Paris ' Sante prison , dropped a rope onto the roof and picked up her husband Michel , 35 , who still had 28 years to serve for attempted murder and armed robbery . In the confusion , another inmate was left behind . Minutes later , the helicopter landed in a nearby soccer field , where the couple jumped into a car and disappeared . <P> Michel 's latest escape , his fourth since 1973 , was at least as spectacular as his 1979 caper , in which he made a getaway after holding up an entire courtroom with a fake gun that he had sculpted out of soap .                 @ @ @ @
