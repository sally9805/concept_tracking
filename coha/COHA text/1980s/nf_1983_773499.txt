txt CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large do himself . ) Years after the book came out , Armour continued to say that the best book on golf was The Gate to Golf , by J. Douglas Edgar . It has been out of print for at least forty years . Armour may not have been the unholy tournament player the press made him out to be . He may not have been the miracle worker his book purported him to be . And he was no club designer . But to all these things that the early pros were supposed to be , Armour added a dash of indifference , a touch of class , a bit of majesty . If Walter Hagen got the pros into the clubhouse ? which he did not ? it was Tommy Armour who taught them not to hold their hats in their hands when they got there . HOW THE TOUR GOT STARTED You could say the Tour began as far back as the year 1900 , when Harry Vardon , the great English professional , made an exhibition circuit of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west as Chicago . The purpose of Vardon 's tour was to promote A. G. Spalding &; Bros. ' new ball , the Vardon Flyer , a tour that was doomed financially for Spalding before it had started , for the Flyer was a " guttie , " a type of ball fast being made obsolete by the revolutionary rubber-wound ball , invented the year before . You could say that 's how the Tour began ? as a commercial junket . And while you might be technically correct , you would be incorrect in the true sense , in what I will call here , for the lack of a macho word that describes something deeper than money , the spiritual sense . You might then say the Tour began with Walter 51 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large Hagen 's coast-to-coast barnstorming tours right after the First World War , during which he made countless oneday stands in the outlands of golfing America playing matches against any and all corners , charging spectators a dollar a head and making in the process more money than Babe Ruth ? and eventually spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is how the Tour began ? a combination of matinee comedy and golfing fireworks ? but again you would be wrong , spiritually . For , whatever the Tour may be worth today and whatever it may end up being worth someday , its beginnings ? its real beginnings ? had nothing whatever to do with money . The Tour was started by a group of men who had had their amateur status taken away from them before they had ever had a chance to use it and who were willing to play golf for money even though it would cost them more than they could possibly win . That may seem preposterous today , with the Tour being worth $14 million the last time anybody looked . But it is true nevertheless . All this happened in what are regarded myopically as the most uneventful years in the game 's history , the anticlimactic decade following Bobby Jones 's Grand Slam in 1930 , when nothing was supposed to happen in golf , what with the Great Depression at full tilt : years that could be interpreted , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindsight to draw on , as being perhaps the most important , and certainly the most apocalyptic , ten years in the entire , considerable history of the professional game . In proper historical perspective , that decade may even prove to have surpassed the boom after the Second World War , even the television renaissance started in 196o 52 How the Tour Got Started with the invention of videotape and with Arnold Palmer as its matinee idol . In those ten years ? 1931 through 1940 inclusive ? steel shafts superseded hickory ? which had been around for centuries ? quicker than ballpoints made us throw fountain pens away . But what really set those years apart was some of the most simply stupendous talent the game had known , or ever has known . Among this talent were Sam Snead , Byron Nelson , and Ben Hogan , to drop three names that ought to be sufficient . The Tour really began during the thirties by some curious flowering that botanists refer to as symbiosis , the growing together of dissimilar things . For the men who played on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for the game . There just is no other word for it . God knows it was n't ambition or vanity and certainly not money . It was just love , the unexplainable kind , the kind that drives other men to paint pictures nobody else can understand or fight poverty in places nobody cares about or climb mountains simply because they are there . To be sure , the Tour was not called the Tour then , but the tournament circuit or , for short , simply the circuit . There had been legitimate tournaments operating for some time . The Los Angeles Open and the Texas Open had been running since the twenties . And there had always been national championships besides the United States Open and the PGA Championship , such as the Western Open , which dated back to 1901 , and the Canadian Open , which had begun in 1904 . In 1934 , the leading money-winner was a studious little man named Paul Runyan , who was from Arkansas but who was working as a club pro in that vast New York City 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where golf clubs were becoming as numerous as gas stations . Runyan 's official money in 1934 was $6,767 , a sum that an accountant told him , after expenses , earned a profit of precisely ten dollars . If twenty-two-year-old Ben Hogan won anything in 1934 , only he would remember . It would be six more years before he would win his first tournament individually . Had the regulations that exist on the Tour today been in force , he would never have had a chance to win any . His playing card would have been taken away from him for poor performance . " Curiously , " Byron Nelson recalls , " I never heard anybody talk about money in those days . Nobody gave a passing thought to becoming famous and certainly not rich . We just had it in us to compete . We just loved to play . That 's all there was to it . " Nelson won a total of $924 that same year . " Why should we have played for money ? " says Jimmy Demaret . " There was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a Hoover button . " The notion that these men continued to play golf because they did n't know how to do anything else is just not economically true . Possibly only Sam Snead , who in 1936 came out of the mountains of western Virginia already a finished player somehow , could truly be said to have been born to play golf . Craig Wood was a trained accountant and made more money in business than many of the members he soon got tired of working for . Lawson Little held a degree from Stanford in economics , had worked in a brokerage house for a short time , and would accumulate a tidy fortune playing the stock market . But when it came 54 How the Tour Got Started to playing golf for love , nobody could approach Demaret . With his smiling good looks , a gift for the theatrical , and a pleasant low-tenor singing voice , Demaret was a natural for what in those days were known as " boy singers , " the fresh-faced crooners who could handle over-the-rainbow lyrics for such hits as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the " girl singer , " who might be thirty-five , sat on a chair nearby and made believe she was in love with him . At one time , Demaret was making as much as $1,500 a week doing this . The most logical question in the world to ask now is why these men played professionally instead of as amateurs when all they were playing for was love . The answer is that they were neither professionals nor amateurs , strictly speaking . They were a strange amalgam of both . They were not professionals in the sense that they made any money at playing the game , obviously , and they were , not quite so obviously , nonamateurs , amateurs who had had their amateur standings taken away from them by a Rule , no longer on the USGA 's book , that withdrew amateur status from anybody who had ever been employed in a golf shop by a professional . Since , almost without exception , all these men had worked in golf shops since boyhood , few of them had ever had a taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required years of waiting , during which you were ineligible to compete anywhere as an amateur and had to abstain from competing as a professional . Putting the situation another way , the Tour would never have begun at all if in the thirties The Rules of Golf had not had a Catch-22 . The man who resolved all this was named Fred Corcoran , who had a genius for everything in the game except 55 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large playing it . Born in Cambridge , Massachusetts , where his father had been employed as a groundskeeper for Harvard University , Corcoran had served in such golf jobs as secretary for the Massachusetts Golf Association before taking over as PGA tournament director from Bob Harlow , Hagen 's old manager who would later found Golf World , the weekly newsmagazine . Harlow had succeeded Francis J. Powers , a Chicago newspaperman who , in turn , had followed Hal Sharkey , sports editor of the Newark Evening News , in New Jersey , who , for not much more than the fun of it , used to line up events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the baseball training camps in Florida . The press had a great deal more to do with starting the Tour than it is given credit for today , when some Tour members act as though things had been the other way around . All these chores had been handled through the PGA largely under the direction of a New Jersey professional named George Jacobus , who had held a number of other executive positions before he was elected its president in 1933 , serving until 1939 . Handsome and what they called then a " ladies ' man , " Jacobus did a lot of economically beneficial things for the pros , such as arranging contracts for them with equipment manufacturers . But he was perhaps too close to the pros to see the financial forest they represented . Which was understandable . Nobody else did , either . They did n't , that is , until Corcoran came along . Glib , humorous , with an imagination too off-beat for Madison Avenue , Corcoran knew instinctively what made the Tour go round and what would make it rich : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People living in the North would read about golf in the winter if only to 56 How the Tour Got Started see how warm it was in the South and , to a certain extent , in the South to see how cool it was in the North during the summer . Consequently , people in the South who wanted to drum up trade in the winter ? resorts , for instance ? needed only to sponsor a golf tournament to get more publicity than they could possibly buy elsewhere . And it went without saying that resorts in the North could do the same in the summer . Corcoran was an enormously gifted public speaker , mainly because he had a way of doing it that gave the impression he did not know how . He could tell five hundred people at a banquet that Franklin D. Roosevelt was President of the United States , and give them the feeling he was letting them in on something . Using this mysterious sense of intime , Corcoran traveled ahead of the Tour , speaking at Chamber of Commerce dinners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would listen to him ? peddling the economic wonders hidden behind a PGA tournament , many of which even the PGA was not aware . And it worked . Under Corcoran ? and despite the Second World War ? tournament purses increased to $ 750,000 . That may not seem like a lot today . But it sure beat playing for love . The late Lloyd Mangrum probably put it best . Mangrum used to shake his head at the prize money the PGA Tour was playing for in his last years , and he had a hard-bitten attitude toward the young men who were being sponsored to play for it . " Try playing for money , " he once said , " when you have n't got any . " // WHAT is par ? What does the word stand for ? Those may seem curious questions to ask , for par is one of the very first words we come upon when we learn to speak in the vocabulary peculiar to golf . But what is par , exactly ? You can be above it , below it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But nobody ever got next to par . You can shoot it , break it , save it , waste it , make it , add or subtract it . On the other hand , you ca n't mend it , spend it , or undo it , and nobody ever multiplies or divides par . Tell somebody on the golf course you are under par and he will envy you . Tell somebody off the golf course you are under par and he will feel sorry for you . Is it any wonder that golf is the game where the lowest score is the best score ? Although there are a lot of things you can do with par , 58 In Search of Par there are also a lot of things you ca n't do with it , among which is understand it . You need only try to explain the word to someone who does n't play golf to find yourself stumbling over thoughts you had long taken for granted . It 's not unlike trying to explain sex to a ten-year-old . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wish you knew how to stop . Par comes from the Latin of the same spelling , meaning ? one that is equal. ? With that in mind , try explaining to a nongolfer that a five on one hole is just as good as a four on another , or a three on still another . Worse still , try to explain that par for a hole is determined primarily by its length . That 's why the one-hundred-twenty-yard seventh hole at Pebble Beach is only a par-three . Then why is the two-hundred-twenty-yard fifth hole at Pine Valley also a par-three ? It should be pointed out , though , that the configuration of the ground can play a part in determining par . If a hole goes downhill , for example , it will play shorter and easier . If it goes uphill , it will play longer and harder . The one-hundred-twentyyard seventh hole at Pebble Beach , to illustrate , goes downhill , whereas the two-hundred-twenty-yard fifth at Pine Valley goes uphill . That 's why they are both parthrees . You understand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in determining its par . The third hole at Oakmont has eighteen sand bunkers , whereas the fourteenth at Augusta National does n't have any . That 's why they are both par-fours , do n't you see ? It would seem that the total par for a course would indicate how difficult it is . But since the length of its individual holes is supposed to determine its par , but does n't , 59 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large and since the severity of its hazards is supposed to aid in that determination , but does n't , quite naturally the sum total of the pars gives you no indication whatsoever of a course 's difficulty . Baltusrol , in northern New Jersey , has a par of 70 . Happy Acres , in southern New Jersey , has a par of 73 . Thus , it would seem that Happy Acres is a far tougher course than Baltusrol . By a fascinating display of arithmetic devised by the United States Golf Association in Far Hills , which is also in New Jersey , Baltusrol works out to be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder . This bit of circumscription is arrived at by a complex mathematical formula that gives us what is known in golf as a course rating . Using this method , Baltusrol turns out to have a course rating of 75.6 . Whereas Happy Acres has one of 68-hence , the eight-stroke difference . So there you have it . Par for each hole is determined by a length and severity nobody pays any attention to . By adding these pars together , you arrive at a par for the course that is actually meaningless . The real , honest-toGod par is the course 's numerical rating , which more often than not works out to be some score that is patently impossible to play ; nobody ever played a golf course in 75.6 , for example . To add insult to injury , all these falsehoods are printed on a scorecard that you are supposed to regard as gospel . If you do n't believe so , make a mistake on one during a tournament and see what happens . Just where did such madness begin ? Well , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of things in golf . Since people have been playing golf for more than five centuries , you 'd think by now they would know the score . Since they did n't , some of them got together nearly 6o In Search of Par ninety years ago to form an organization that would try to . It is called the United States Golf Association , and it runs the game throughout roughly half the golfing world ? which is to say , America . The other half is run by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews , Scotland , which has been in business since 1754 ? Together these two organizations have compiled a book that purports to tell you how the game ought to be played . It is called The Rules of Golf . There are forty-one rules , with a hundred or more sub-clauses and a thousand exceptions . The latest edition of the Rules takes up ninety pages . A recent book that tried to make sense out of them takes up two hundred . And published interpretations of them are literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R and A are in total agreement about everything in golf ? with one exception , par . Neither has the foggiest notion what it means . The R and A , in fact , is so stumped by the meaning of the word that it does n't even bother using it . Instead it recommends keeping score by seeing how you stand with level fours , eighteen of which add up to 72 on golf courses everywhere but in the United States , where they somehow add up to 75.6 . Par is so utterly meaningless that the people who make their living at the game disdain to use it . Ask a professional what he shot on a par-seventy-two golf course , and he will almost invariably say 69 , not " three under par . " Or ask him what he scored on any given hole and he will almost automatically say three or four , whatever the case may have been , instead of " par . " As a matter of fact , the word is held in such disrespect among professionals that they will often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and a half , " which is a little like saying 6r CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large you have " two-point-three-children , " the way insurance actuaries do . In The Rules of Golf , par is defined as being " the score that an expert golfer would be expected to make for a given hole . Par means errorless play without flukes and under ordinary weather conditions , allowing two strokes on the putting green . " That should be clear enough . But all sorts of things can be read into that statement by a professional . " Errorless play , " for one thing , might mean eighteen straight three 's , a philosophy advanced thirty years ago by Ben Hogan . For another thing , " two strokes on the putting green " throughout a round would be regarded by a professional as an amateurish performance . Finally , from " under ordinary weather conditions " he would draw the conclusion that is must never rain in Far Hills . To most professionals , par is thought to have almost certainly been an ancient invention by amateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par was more an offshoot of professional than amateur golf . It came into being sometime about the time of the first British Open , in 186o . Until then golf had always been played at match play ; the player who first got his or her ball into the hole won it . But for the initial British Open the professionals balked at the prospect of spending an entire week away from their jobs . So the first British Open was played over a weekend and by the simple method of keeping an account of the strokes each contestant took rather than of the holes each won or lost against a single opponent . Somehow out of all this came the philosophy of par , the score that an expert would be expected to make for a given hole . That score , however , was considerably in ex-62 In Search of Par cess of what we expect of an expert today . Willie Park , an early-day Tom Watson from Musselburgh , won with a score of 163 for thirty-six holes . As a consequence , par ranged up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the turn of the century indicates it had no fewer than six par-sixes . In those days the allowance of two putts per green was entirely realistic . Putting greens were chock-full of weeds , crabgrass , and all sorts of other agronomical garbage . Putting as we know it today was , in practice , more a matter of chipping then . And so " two-putting " was distinctly the mark of a professional or that rare amateur who was the professional 's equal . Busting par wide open has now become so commonplace that the purpose of par , which was none too clear in the first place , has become as antiquated as the bisque , the jigger , and the dumb blonde who does n't know which end of the caddie to hit the ball with . For the sake of common sense , and rationality , and eventually sanity , why persist in keeping alive something that was embalmed a generation ago ? All of which brings up the question of whether or not par was ever alive . According to the people who keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PGA Tour are shot in eighteen pars . Whether a round in eighteen pars with two putts on every green has ever been shot seems so unlikely as to put it in the realm of the impossible . Out of respect for the USGA ? for the people there have kept the game from spreading to total madness ? it should be pointed out that they know something I have suspected for years : Golf is not and was never meant to be a fair game . Equitable , yes . But fair , no . Without its rubs of the 63 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large green we might just as well go out and toss quoits . To make sure it never does become as fair as , say , checkers , maybe we ought to make some sort of substitute for par within the game , even if it does n't work , either . It 's fun to watch and read about people shooting , breaking , saving , wasting , making , and adding something that does n't exist . Everybody likes a good mystery . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today is as real as Cinderella . And it 's later than the USGA thinks . // Wt E N I was a boy of fourteen or so , I went to a school run by the Jesuits , where we spent many frustrating afternoons in the spring conjugating Latin words when we were dying to go swimming or play baseball or , at least a few of us , hit golf balls . What the good fathers were trying to teach us was that there were far more interesting fivesyllable words than delicatessen , and that the sense of any of them , no matter how many syllables , could be extracted by breaking down its components . My favorite was **28;70;TOOLONG . While I knew what it meant , I could never find any use for it . Well , I can now . I can use it against those who go around shooting their mouths off about how lousy a golf course Merion is . The Merion Golf Club sits on Philadephia 's Main Line , for years one of the starchiest 65 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host to its fourth United States Open Championship , all in all , its fifteenth USGA championship of some kind or another . In other words , Merion is pretty well established . However , Merion 's golf course is only 6,544 yards long , which most professionals on the Tour today would classify as an amusement park . To make matters worse , the course is jammed into not more than ninety acres , or two thirds what most championship courses use , which means there is n't much room for gallery . Furthermore , the club is so hard up for parking space that there is barely room for the members ' cars , let alone those that will bring twenty thousand spectators . For these reasons there are those who think Merion ought to be dismissed from the USGA establishment . I , for one , am against them . I am anti the school of thought that would remove Merion from the arena of American championship golf . To see why , let 's look at golf in the real world . If you think the Merion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Sunnybrook or especially Gulph Mills . The last , which has n't had a guest in almost thirty years , is so Ivy League that its members protect themselves from sunburn with calamine lotion . Gulph Mills makes nearby Pine Valley , which is famous for its sanctity , look like Cobb 's Creek , a Philadelphia municipal course where people have been known to play in their underwear . That the USGA has staged fifteen championships at Merion stands up to contemporary reasoning , not just nostalgia . In this day , when Tour pros every week make par all but meaningless , Merion had not had its par for 66 Merion four rounds broken in one of those championships until 1981 , with one exception . Jack Nicklaus shot 269 back in 196o during the USGA 's World Amateur Team Championship , which was one of the first indications we had that he was Superman . But , as Nicklaus himself was the first to point out , Merion that week was " not a championship course . " For one thing , the course was soaking wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed down the greens , and moved the tee markers forward so that the many inexperienced teams , such as the one from India , whose members had never seen a first-rate course before , would be able to break too . That Merion is only 6,544 yards long makes it short only on the scorecard , not when you play it . Its par is 70 , or two strokes less than what par usually is . The course has only two par-fives , both on the front nine and both possibly reachable but not sensibly hittable by anyone with brains enough to win an Open Championship . Six of its par-fours are less than four-hundred yards , meaning that the pitching wedge will come into use on those holes , plus the two par-fives , for a total of at least eight times . ( Soon after he won the National Open at Merion in 1950 , Ben Hogan admitted to some friends that he did not admire the course for that reason . ) If one thing has dramatically improved scoring in modern Modern Golf ? which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the pitching wedge , which did n't really come into wholesale favor until the government released restrictions on steel after the Second World War . To be sure , there had been the sand wedge , which often served double duty off turf . But the sand wedge , with its raised leading edge and bouncy soleplate , was nowhere near as 67 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large effective as today 's pitching wedge . At Merion the pros have a field day with the club . Whether or not they break par is another matter . But do n't disestablish Merion as a championship layout because it calls for a club that was established by the very men who are playing on it . That Merion can barely accommodate twenty-thousand spectators has now become an empty-headed argument . There will probably be more Chinese-Americans , left-handed schoolgirls , Honda drivers with eyeglasses ? more people of any kind ? watching a USGA championship at Merion on television than there will be people of all kinds actually at Merion all week . Tour golf and those championships that need Tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only TV but Eastern TV , where the most people are . That 's why you can see the British Open or the Hawaiian Open in the middle of the afternoon in New York . Merion , with its landscape compressed into ninety acres and with a total of just four vantage spots from which you can scan the whole golf course , is custom-cut for TV . With galleries roped off the way they are now , nobody over the age of thirty has enough stamina to follow all the leaders in a major event . I have n't seen a crucial shot , live , at a big tournament in twenty years , and I 've been to more national championships than most golfers have been to airports . The spectators at Merion will not have room anywhere near the clubhouse to park their cars , and in this respect Merion is showing what golf championships are coming to . The fact is , no golf club can any longer accommodate the cars that transport twenty thousand spectators to a tournament , with the major exception of Augusta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the theory that it 68 Merion makes little difference where you enter a golf course to see a tournament , every club that plays host to one has been asking spectators for years to park on the perimeter of the course , not near the clubhouse . At Merion , they have to . If you are tired of the adjective great in golf ? and who is n't by now ? ? then you can comfortably refer to Merion as one of the classic golf clubs in the world . Its clubhouse , the architecture of which might best be described as Garfield Gothic , has not been renovated , painted , or some might say even dusted in two generations . It has the sort of homey atmosphere you would enjoy if you like to look at Packard ads in The Saturday Evening Post . I first played there in 1946 , and I could n't notice any change the last time I was there , which was in 1980 . That is the way the members want it , and that is the way it is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not if you come from a town where they call a city block a " square , " where they put mustard on pretzels , and where for breakfast they eat ground pig meat , called " scrapple . " I 've never been able to understand it , and I was born there . There may still be some members at Merion from the old Philadelphia families ? the Whartons , Strawbridges , Pennypackers ? who are so old they look down their noses at Bostonians and do n't even speak to New Yorkers . But not if they do n't play golf . You strictly play golf at the Merion Golf Club , as the name says , and take your tennis and cricket and polo elsewhere , possibly to the Merion Cricket Club , which was disassociated from the Golf Club just prior to the Second World War . The members never tire of Merion because they never tire of the golf course , which may be the least boring course in America . They only resign from the club when they decide to live year-69 CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such inconspicuously wealthy place , and sometimes not even then . They keep paying dues just to keep a Merion bag tag , or something . At least half a dozen members were members when Bobby Jones finished off his Grand Slam there in 1930 , and one of them , Meredith " Beau " Jack , played there in the Amatuer Championship of 1916 , when fourteen-year-old Jones made his championship debut . Mr. Jack , who lives downtown and is still active in real estate , shoots regularly near his age ? which just goes to show what scrapple can do for you . When the USGA decided to hold the Open once again at Merion in 1981 , it knew better than to ask the members to make architectural changes in the course . Merion would n't alter that course for the Second Coming , let alone another golf championship . Except for a bunker on the sixth fairway and the removal of a sick sycamore or two , the course is substantially the same as it was when the Open was first played there , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind by a burly California pro named Olin Dutra , and it is basically the same as it was when it opened for play in the spring of 1912 . Merion would seem to be an oddity in that it was designed not by an architect and not even by a professional acting as one , but by an amateur who had never designed a golf course before . But then so were Pebble Beach , Pine Valley , and Oakmont , a string of architectural wonders that may have prompted professional architects to form their own society about forty years ago . Those amateurs were stealing their thunder . Actually , they were n't . The architects of those inspired courses never built another worth playing . Like the book 70 Merion everybody is going to write someday , it seems that all of us have one good golf course buried inside us . The man who had the incomparable Merion inside him was named Hugh Wilson . He was chosen by the members of the then Merion Cricket Club , first of all because he had been born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merion ; and , third , because he apparently had a lot of time on his hands . Wilson took the better part of a year studying the famous links in the British Isles . While it would take a very trained eye to detect any seaside characteristics in Merion today , the transformation Wilson made of the rolling parkland in suburban Philadelphia smacked of near-genius . Although designed for the hickory shaft and lifeless ball of 1911 I , when the course was constructed , Merion 's par remained unprofaned for more than seventy years , all this without an architectural trick on it and , with the exception of 1934 , under perfect weather conditions . We might have learned more about Wilson 's genius had he designed another course , but he died at the age of forty-six before another was completed . One innovation , distinctive in America , that Wilson added and that had nothing to do with architecture was the substitution of wicker baskets for flagsticks . All sorts of apocryphal stories are attached to how they got there , one being that they originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . The members say none of these stories is true . Actually , as even most of the members are unaware , the idea was borrowed by Wilson from Sunningdale , in England , which has n't used them since the Second World War . For a time they were also used at Sea Island , Georgia . At any rate , their purpose at Merion is to keep the player from knowing from which direction 7 1 CHARLES PRICE / Gofer-at-Large the wind is blowing , a tiny difficulty during practice rounds but a not-inconsiderable one during an Open Championship , when club selection is always critical . To compound the difficulty , Merion 's flagsticks , in keeping with its relatively small greens , are a foot shorter than the standard ones used at most courses . If you are not aware of this , as every pro capable of winning an Open ought to be , you can find yourself constantly overclubbing . All truly great golf courses have an almost supernatural finishing hole , by way of separating the chokers from the strokers . The eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a **29;100;TOOLONG par-four uphill off the tee with possibly a downhill lie for the second shot . In 1950 , Hogan supposedly hit a great shot with his two-iron to the eighteenth green in the fourth round of the Open to tie Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio . Actually , Hogan played the shot with a one-iron , which was stolen after the round and which he replaced for the playoff with the seven-iron he had removed to accommodate it . And the shot was hardly great , as Hogan had privately explained . It landed on the left front of the green , nearly fifty feet from the hole . But Merion could be just as famous for its first hole as for its last , if anybody ever talked about first holes , which nobody ever does . The opening hole at Merion is perfect for the role it is supposed to play , which is not just to let you shake hands with the course but embrace it . It is short , only three hundred fifty-five yards , which means you can concentrate on playing a golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right , which is the way you want the first hole anywhere to bend if it must bend at all . ( Of one thousand amateurs , 999 of them will slice off the 72 Merion first tee , while the pro , whom you want to test , will hook , if anything . ) Most important , there is nothing preliminary , nothing introductory , about the hole . It does n't flow into the golf course ; it is the golf course . It makes you know you are about to play eighteen holes as soon as you step onto the tee , not seventeen and a half . Indeed , with a total of nine very strategically placed bunkers , the hole is so tight it could be one of the finishing holes and not be out of place . And so the course goes , one piece of poetry after another . Merion has a hundred twenty bunkers and every single one is there for play , not display . Chick Evans , who won the Amateur Championship there in 1916 after winning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white faces of Merion , " after the dazzling quarry sand they are filled with . As someone once said , the course is easy if you just stay out of the white faces . But nobody has ever been able to . That 's why Merion is part of the golf establishment . And that 's why it ought to remain there . // E v E R Y B o D Y called him Sammy in those days , the people out of respect for somebody handsomely homespun and the press out of duty to sports editors who would not let a given name pass when a nickname would do . And so he became " Slammin ' Sammy " Snead . Lord knows , he deserved it . The man was beautiful , almost gorgeous , this at a time when those much overused words meant something more than just out of the ordinary . All you had to do to believe what you had read was to see him walk . His gait was like a cougar 's on the scent of a doe , steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip . He could kick the top of a seven-foot doorway and pick a ball out of the cup without bending his knees . Some people said he was double-jointed . But he was n't . He just had a body that was ? well , gorgeous . 74 I Remember Sammy He had just turned twenty-six at the time , and I was twelve , bug-eyed over this game at a period in life when you were considered a sissy if you did n't deify Lou Gehrig or Bronco Nagurski . I had never seen Sammy hit a shot , but he was already my unspoken idol , this pedestal he sat on having been made for me by the purple press of the day . He did not let me down when I finally got to see him play . This event took place on the old course at Congressional , near Washington , where I was growing up . Congressional was to be the Middle Atlantic scene of qualifying rounds for the ' 39 Open Championship . That would be tomorrow , a Monday . But today was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy Thomson , now the second longest hitter in the game , and with Horton Smith , the putter , and Wiffy Cox , the home pro . Because of the crowds , my father had to park the car near the first green . Consequently we missed the tee-off as well as the second shots . I weaseled my way toward the first ball I could see lying on the fairway . By a miracle I then considered a major one , the ball turned out to be Sammy 's . The first hole at Congressional then was a par-five . The ball was Sammy 's second shot and he was about eighty yards short of the green . He was dressed in white bucks , cream-colored slacks , a white shirt with a florid tie tucked into it , and a white cap . ( The coconut-straw hat with the paisley band had yet to become his trademark . ) His caddie , already panting from the weight of the largest golf bag I had ever seen , reached the ball first , of course , and stood guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a museum . Then came Sammy , with that John 75 CHARLES PRICE / Gofer-at-Large Wayne way of walking . He surveyed the situation , hands on hips . I could almost touch him , not difficult because he was at least eleven feet tall . He plucked a sand iron from his bag ? the pitching wedge had yet to come into use ? and then addressed the ball in that no-nonsense manner of his . One glance over his shoulder toward the flagstick , then that almost exaggerated forward press , and next a punch shot that was pure Beethoven . When the ball reached its apex , it looked as though it had been painted against the sky . Then it floated toward the green , did a little dance on the putting surface , and finally came to rest three feet from the hole . Even I , who had won twentyseven National Opens in my backyard , could not have made a sweeter shot in my imagination . It seemed almost criminal that Sammy had to qualify for the ' 39 Open . Two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won so many other tournaments that he was placed on the Ryder Cup Team . In ' 38 he had been leading money-winner , but had somehow finished in a tie for thirty-ninth at the Open , not nearly good enough to gain him an exemption . To add incredibility to the situation , he almost did n't qualify in ' 39 . In the morning round , he shot a 74 , a pace that was n't even up to that of a sixteen-year-old local amateur . But in the afternoon , he stitched his game together and shot a 65 . It was anybody 's Open at Spring Mill , the suburban course . of the Philadelphia Country Club . It could have been won by Ralph Guldahl , then after his third straight Open , or Johnny Bulla , Dick Metz , Ky Laffoon , Jug McSpaden , Paul Runyan , Ed Dudley , Henry Picard , or Horton Smith . But it was n't . This Open was preordained to be Sammy 's , the first of 76 I Remember Sammy ten or so he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , press , and public alike , an opinion substantiated not inconsiderably by the fact that Sammy had led the first day with a 68 . This score was followed with a 71 and a 73 , and at the seventeenth tee during the last round he needed only two pars for a 70 , a score that meant he had been leading all the way and that he would win by two strokes . It was not to be , however . Byron Nelson shot 68 , playing right in front of Sammy , with a par on the last hole , which Sammy had thought surely had been a birdie for a total of 283 . Inexplicably , Sammy bogeyed the par-four seventeenth . The gallery was in a state of pandemonium , all ten thousand of them , as they came to the eighteenth tee . Marshaling was then something officials made up as they went along , using ropes and bamboo poles . Tee-togreen ropes were then undreamed of . And leader boards ? Well , they just were not . I had been sitting next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to tell my grandchildren I had seen Slammin ' Sammy win the first of those ten National Opens . What I then saw has since , years later , been reconstructed for me by Sam , and it differs so much from maybe five hundred other interpretations as to make me wonder just who was there and who was n't . Anyway , Sammy ? thinking he needed a birdie-four to win or a par-five to tie Nelson ? drew his drive into the left-hand rough . ( He did n't know that Nelson had only tied , not won from , Craig Wood and Denny Shute . ) Undismayed , he then used a two-and-a-half-wood out of the rough . The ball squirted into a fairway bunker that Sammy had not even paid attention to , much less tried to 77 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large avoid . Again , using his two-and-a-half-wood , he tried to reach the green in three . The ball hit the bank of the bunker , jumped several feet straight up , and plopped tiredly to rest on the bank , leaving Sammy what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the ball at the level of his knees , he then left-looped it into the bunker that skirts the green , now fifteen feet from where I had been squatting for three hours . Now with his fantastic talent for recovering from sand nullified by a stance that left his left foot buried deeply into it and his right placed precariously on the bank , he puffed the ball barely onto the putting surface . Miserable , as he had every right to be , he then stroked a fifty-foot putt that he thought would only lose to Nelson but actually would have tied Wood and Shute and Nelson . Dramatically for the gallery , who knew what was going on , the ball almost went in , skimming the left lip of the cup and coming to rest three feet beyond . Heartbroken , and still ignorant of what was what , he made a mere swipe at the next putt and left it inches short . He did not seem to want to even line it up . Then he tapped in . Not since my Uncle Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried at the funeral of his wife have I seen such a dreadful expression on a grown man 's face as that on Slammin ' Sammy 's after he had tapped in . In my young years it had not occurred to me that such an emotion as pity could be spent on eleven-foot idols . I wanted to scamper off into the woods and get sick . My stomach was not helped at all when , five minutes later , Slammin ' Sammy was interviewed by Bill Stern , then the top sports announcer for the Blue Network . " Slammin ' Sammy ? " he asked in those doomsday phrases used then as now , in our 78 I Remember Sammy own television era by the nitwits who interview professional wrestlers , and all those others on the air who make a living begging the question hours before the question has arrived . " Slammin ' Sammy , " Stern said , " tell our audience out there . And there are millions of them ! Tell us ? just as it comes off the top of your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made you choke ' ? " " Choking " is an expression in golf that dates clear back to Walter Hagen at least , and probably back to the Tom Morrises . Even then it was a term that you used only behind a man 's back and later to a man 's face only when you were being facetious . Under no circumstances , though , did you use it to a man who had taken eight on a hole he might very well have scored in four , particularly when it cost the man an Open Championship . Or was it ten ? From that day on for nearly twenty years , the National Open took on an added dimension . There was the question of who was going to win it . There was now also the question of how Slammin ' Sammy was going to lose it . It was Bob Jones , I think , who first said nobody ever wins the National Open , somebody just manages to lose it . This unpleasant role had often fallen to Macdonald Smith . But Old Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drinking problem that he did not shake off until way past his prime . Slammin ' Sammy , though , was a teetotaler , a nonsmoker , the most gifted golfer in the game , and had a body that looked as though it might last the ages . It was said he would win tournaments until he was sixty , which he has ; but that theory was then altered to exclude the National Open . Indeed , it was downright ingenious the way he man-79 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large aged to lose some of them . At Canterbury , the very next year after Spring Mill , he opened with a 67 , two strokes lower than anybody else in the field . A 72 , five strokes higher , in the last round would have won the championship by a stroke , a 73 would have tied Gene Sarazen and Lawson Little . Slammin ' Sammy shot an 81 . He had lost it again . In 1947 at St. Louis , he tied Lew Worsham . On the eighteenth green of the playoff they still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first from about thirty feet , leaving the ball slightly inside a yard of the hole . Slammin ' Sammy putted next , leaving his ball at what seemed to the unmeasuring eye as precisely the same distance . Without so much as releasing his grip from the putter , he walked to the ball in the unmistakable gesture of a man about to hole out . " Wait a minute ! " said Worsham , an old friend and still one . Worsham could very well have been the man away , and he was professional enough to know that the man who gets the ball in the cup first has all the psychological advantage . Unheeding , Snead kept on walking and was about to address the crucial putt , not wishing to impede his momentum . " Wait a min-ute ! " ordered Worsham . Now desperate , he threw courtesy to the winds and started to place his foot between Snead 's ball and the cup . " Let 's have a measurement here ! " A USGA official was called to perform with a tape measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an inch , a difference that perhaps only a man with the eyes of Snead could determine unaided . He putted first , and missed . Worsham then calmly holed out , and Slammin ' Sammy had lost another National Open . 8o I Remember Sammy Two years later at Chicago 's Medinah , Slammin ' Sammy came to the next-to-last hole needing only a parthree and a par-four to tie Cary Middlecoff , who had scrambled home with a 75 . Snead 's iron shot off the tee fell hole-high to the right , about six feet off the putting surface . One of the great chippers in the history of the game and a sometimes brilliant but often uncertain putter under pressure , he inexplicably elected to run the ball up to the cup with his erratic putter . The ball dragged off the frog-hair and did not even come close to the cup . Slammin ' Sammy missed that one , to nobody 's surprise , and once again had been tagged , like a golf bag that has been through too many airports , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now become to Slammin ' Sammy a psychological fence he could not hurdle , a bar he could not high jump , a pole he could not vault . No matter how fast he ran or how high he jumped , he somehow always tipped the one that somebody else had cleared . The final incident happened in 1953 at Oakmont , the shotmaker 's course with the Crisco-covered greens . Trailing Ben Hogan by five strokes after the first round with a par 72 to Hogan 's 67 , he picked up two strokes with a 6g in the second round and still another stroke with a 72 in the third . Still on Hogan 's heels through the twelfth of the final round , he staggered home with a 76 for a total of 289 , a score that ordinarily until then would have won at ( ) akmont , for decades a course that had been the National Open 's outdoor insane asylum . ' ' his time , though , Slammin ' Sammy suffered no ignominy . Hogan , who finished three-three-three , was unstoppable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large faster , jump higher , or vault taller than anybody else around . Not even a Slammin ' Sammy could stop him , despite the fact he held an edge on Hogan in playoffs for various other tournaments . But these were tournaments , not championships , and most of all they were not National Opens . Fallen idols are not something nice to look at . But I learned something about golf when Slammin ' Sammy took his eight at Spring Mill thirty-five years ago which has become increasingly more apparent to me . Golf , especially championship golf , is n't supposed to be any fun , was never meant to be fair , and never will make any sense . If you do n't believe me , ask Slammin ' Sammy Snead , the first man never to have won any of the ten National Opens he was supposed to have won . He was beautiful . He was ? well , gorgeous . Almost . // GIMMICKS HAVE seen mink headcovers , bamboo shafts , concave sand wedges , the twelve-wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tees , distance measurers , girdles that keep your elbows together , an iron that can be converted into everything from a two-iron to a niblick , gadgets that steady your head , and putters as ugly as Stillson wrenches . But the silliest thing I have ever seen in golf is the headcover that goes with the ball retriever . One I saw was made of glove leather , like an Italian shoe , and . was used to protect a retriever made of anodized aluminum , a material that would n't rust if you left it for twenty years in the Great Salt Lake . Now , golfers have always been on the order of slightly nuts . But is our generation turning into golfing idiots ? I mean , where does all this zaniness begin and end ? 83 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large The fact is , there will probably never be any end to the dizziness of golf , and you would have to go back a long way to discover when it first started . The track-iron and the water-iron go back to the eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once were around . The former had a head no larger than a silver dollar , and was used to extricate the ball from buggy tracks back in those puritanical days when you played the course as you found it and the ball as it lay . The water-iron had teeth in it , like those on a rake , to reduce resistance getting the ball out of shallow water , and was used in those far-off days when there was water , water everywhere but not a drop of it casual . You either played the ball out of water if you could , or suffered a penalty . " My God , " Jimmy Demaret told me once , " the courses these kids play today are either half casual water or ground-under-repair . I played in a tournament in New York several years ago that must have had eight tons of lime on it . The PGA circled everything that was n't in letter-perfect condition . They even circled some trees in lime . Now , what could be more natural on a golf course than a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't very big . Every third shot we played was dropping the ball over our shoulders . One of these days I 'm going to write a book on drops . That ought to sell . The shot 's become more popular than putting . " Is there really anything new under the golf sun ? We take steel shafts for granted , for example , now that aluminum has made its inroads . It 's popularly thought that steel shafts were innovated in the early thirties , right after Bobby Jones had made the Grand Slam with hickory . The 84 Gadgets and Gimmicks fact is , steel shafts have been on the market since 1914 , when Jones was twelve years old , and were introduced by a company named Bristol that was big in the golf business in those days but that has long since passed out of the picture , like so many that were ahead of their times . I have long had a theory that it does n't make much difference what the shaft of a golf club is made out of , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the right person . This notion was rather substantially backed up for me a few years ago by no less than Arnold Palmer . At my club , which is called Harbour Town , on Hilton Head Island , South Carolina , we have an annual Tour event each April . It is the custom at this event for the defending champion to play himself into office as " the Captain of Gentlemen Golfers " by hitting a ball to the sound of cannon shot in front of the members and anyone else who cares to watch , in the manner of that same officer at the Royal and Ancient at St. Andrews . Since Palmer had won the event ? the Heritage Classic ? the year before , it was his honor . For the occasion , Laurie Auchterlonie , St. Andrews 's master clubmaker , had specially made up a hickory-shafted " play club " on the order of those used in 1786 , when golf was first played in South Carolina . Anyway , Palmer duly presented himself for the ceremonies , which were being attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I handed the play club to him , as though it were the Holy Grail , and he gripped it as though it were a two-day-old baby . " You want me to hit the ball with this ? " he said , as though he were afraid it might turn into ashes . " Yes , " I said . " Laurie tells me even you ca n't snap the shaft . " 85 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large To retrieve the ball , a caddie was sent out into the practice field . Hesitantly , he walked about a hundred fifty yards . Then as though to say " What the hell , this is Arnold Palmer , " he marched out another fifty yards . Arnie teed up the ball , took one practice swing , three waggles , and then swung . When the ball got to where the caddie was standing , the ball was fifty feet over his head and still rising . No one applauded . Maybe it was because almost all of them were holding champagne glasses . But I like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just seen . There was just a gigantic sigh of monosyllabic awe . Here was a man who had never hit a shot in his life with a hickory-shafted club , much less a play club , which is built along the lines of an elongated butter knife , and he had hit his first shot with it three hundred yards . Arnie turned to me with a smile , and I tossed him another ball . He hit this one even longer than the first . Then another . And another . And still another , all the while to the accompaniment of a cannon that must have been heard two counties away . After we had run out of balls , Arnie turned to me and handed back the club . " How ? " I asked . " It 's easy , " he answered . " All you have to do is swing a little slower . " And what about the golf ball itself ? I do n't mean the one Arnie hit , which was a cheap one we practically give away to visitors as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball we all use , the so-called rubber-core ball . Before it was the " guttie , " which was simply a solid mass of molded gutta-percha . It superseded the " feathery , " which 86 Gadgets and Gimmicks consisted of two pieces of tanned bull 's hide sewed together and then stuffed by a pike with wet feathers which , when dried , gave the ball its resiliency . ( I do n't know much about the properties of the feathery , but I do know that an amateur named Ted Blackwell , who had the reputation of being the longest hitter of his day , once drove the eighteenth green at St. Andrews , which is three hundred fifty-six yards long , with a guttie . ) But to get back to the rubber-cored ball , I have never heard of an early golf ball that actually had a rubber core . They were all wound with rubber , but , with the exception of ' some range balls , the core has consisted of everything except rubber . Even the original patent on the rubber ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work , of Akron , and Coburn Haskell , of Cleveland , stated that it would have " a central core-section of gutta percha or the like . " Right there is where they made their mistake ? " the like . " Within a few years manufacturers were putting out virtually the same kind of ball ? the Black Domino , the Red Honor , the Bullet , the Midget , the Kro-Flite ? all of which had rubber winding but substituted for gutta-percha in the core various liquids and such solids as gelatin , tapioca , and even chicken blood . In 1905 one manufacturer introduced a pneumatic ball , the center of which was filled with high-compression air . Although the ball eventually blistered under heat and exploded , sometimes with a well-known pain while in the player 's back pocket , It nevertheless compensated for itself by selling for only a quarter and reacting with astonishing accuracy . Alex Smith , Macdonald 's less-heralded brother , won the Na-87 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large tional Open with one of these balls a year after they went on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open , no less , was won with a ball that had no core at all . Just a lot of hot air . And putters ! There just can not ever be anything new in this line of equipment . Something similar to the " Ping " ? in that it has no perceptible sweet-spot ? first came on the market in 1922 . It was named the " Guerne " and nicknamed " The King of Putters . " It was manufactured by a Dr. A. A. Guerne , of Kalamazoo , who even then claimed to have been in the putter business for more than thirty years . The " Bull 's Eye " ? I do n't remember exactly when the " Cash-In " was first put out by Spalding ? my guess is 1934 ? but I fail to see any mechanical difference between the two except that the Bull 's Eye has certain design sophistications that make it a far superior weapon . In point of fact , so-called " center-shafted " putters ? of which the Ping and the Bull 's Eye are superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that year , Walter J. Travis , an amateur who may well have been the greatest putter who ever lived , used one for the first time in his life to win the British Amateur , so adeptly that , as a matter of almost laughable history , the British banned centershafted putters in competition for almost half a century on the theory that it was the putter that got the ball in the hole and not the player . To understand this bit of historical nonsense , you first have to understand a little bit about Travis himself . An Australian by birth but an American by upbringing , he first took up the game at the age of thirty-five . Four years 88 Gadgets and Gimmicks later he won the National Amateur , winning the medal as well on the first of six occasions he was to do so . This event was won with the guttie . The following year , using the rubber-wound ball for the first time , he successfully defended his title . Most of this incredible golf was created with the then conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose shaft was connected to the heel of the blade . ( By the way , he was one of the first to use the now universally adopted reverse-overlap grip with a putter at a time when everybody else gripped it as though it were a Coney Island hot dog . ) Even with the blade of the day , which had the loft of a one-iron to carry the ball over the crabgrass and other agronomical crap that existed even on championship courses , Travis holed out from such immeasurable distances that his opponents claimed he could putt the eyes out of a chipmunk . Having won three out of the last four National Amateurs , Travis decided in 1904 to try his hand at the British Amateur , a title then no one from foreign soil had ever won , least of all an American , a nationality not thought at the time to be able to play golf at all . The championship was played at Sandwich , in the south of England , not a long course but as tight as a Japanese garden and as windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing a fairway and play through a hurricane wearing a ten-gallon hat . Sandwich was perfect ; that is , except for one major item . Travis , playing practice rounds in the environs of London , had inexplicably lost his Houdini putting touch . He could n't hit a bathtub with a cake of soap . Since it was obvious he could n't use his own putter with 89 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large any degree of confidence , Travis decided on the day before the championship that he had nothing to lose by borrowing somebody else 's . An American friend loaned him what later became known as a " Schenectady , " so-named after a Mr. A. W. Knight of that city who had been the first to use it . It had a mallet head with the shaft inserted halfway between the heel and the center . Hence , the somewhat inaccurate term center-shafted . Three thousand miles from home , staying at a hotel that had overlooked his room reservation , given no locker in the clubhouse , assigned a cross-eyed caddie , playing over an unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks before , using a putter he had never even practiced with , and congenitally aloof to begin with , Travis played in stony silence clear to the final , where , dramatically enough , he , one of the shortest knockers in the history of championship golf , met none other than Ted Blackwell , the man who had once driven the last green at St. Andrews with a guttie . It was no contest . Blackwell would outdrive Travis by a hundred yards , only to lose the hole when Travis , with his newfound " Schenectady , " would can a putt that seemed to the incredulous gallery to be almost as long as the Lusitania , and the applause that greeted it was deafening with its silence . You could hear the wind whistling through the dunes . Not quite half a century later , the British lifted the ban on center-shafted putters . Soon afterward , a man who had never played in the British Open entered it for the first and only time . He won it , using a putter he had virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gadgets and Gimmicks serted halfway between the heel and the center of a brass blade . In other words , it was center-shafted . But this time no one argued over whether it was the putter or the man , and the applause was thundering . His name was Ben Hogan. 91 TOURNAMENTS , CHICAGO STYLE M v first trip to Chicago , ever , was in the company of the late Fred Corcoran , the promoter and publicist from New York who invented the PGA Tour . You will not see Corcoran given credit for the Tour in the minutes of any PGA meeting or spelled out in the history books . But it is the truth , nevertheless . Before Corcoran came along in 1936 , the Tournament Circuit , as the Tour was then called , had been little more than a string of informal merchandise shows , during which the local public was entertained by a couple dozen pros trying to beat each other for a purse of $5,000 or thereabouts . In twelve years , with no inflation and a world war going on , Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first prize . Fred remained an utter realist about professional golf right up until the day he died in 1976 , surprising for a man 92 Tournaments , Chicago Style whose office was mainly in his hat and who never thought any idea was ridiculous as long as it was original . There was nothing mysterious or romantic or dramatic about the Tour to Fred . It was there for the self-aggrandizement of the sponsors , purely and simply . Fred had a theory that half the tournaments on the Tour would n't be on it if TV did n't cover them , that half the remaining would cancel if the AP decided not to carry the results , and that all of the rest , including the Masters Tournament and all our national championships , would fold if they did n't get volunteer help . The players ? That was the easiest part of all . " Only one man can win a golf tournament at one time , " Fred used to say . " If he can win two , people are going to start saying , Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is make him sound as though he belongs in Who 's Who . " I went with Fred on my first trip to Chicago in 1952 . We took the Twentieth Century Limited from New York to see the All-America Golf Tournament and the World 's Championship of Golf , which would be staged during successive weeks in suburban Niles at Tam 0 ' Shanter , the nouveau Ritz of America 's country clubs , which was owned , operated , and very personally presided over by George Storr May , then sixty-two , the florid-faced founder of the George S. May Co. , an organization of " business engineers " so complex that even Fortune magazine , a congressional committee , and the Internal Revenue Service could n't figure out precisely what they did . That 's how the public knew him . But in Fred Corcoran 's eyes he was worth knowing because he knew things about running a golf tournament that even Fred had n't thought of . It would be no hyperbole to say that if George S. May were alive today , the prize money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be $1 million ? easily . If you think that may be an exaggeration , you need only consider a few facts from the records . In 1954 , Ed Furgol received $6,000 for winning the United States Open . Chick Harbert got $5,000 for winning the PGA Championship . Sam Snead also got $5,000 for winning the Masters Tournament . And Peter Thomson got a set of headcovers for winning the British Open . ( Or something like that . ) That year Bob Toski received $50,000 for winning May 's World 's Championship , not counting an additional $50,000 that May paid him for playing a series of exhibitions afterward . It was May 's rule of thumb that his World 's prize money would remain at least three times larger than that of any other tournament . The largest tournament now is the Tournament Players Championship , which has a purse of $500,000 . Three times $500,000 is ? well , it 's a million bucks . Easily . As we entered the diner of the Twentieth Century Limited somewhere around Poughkeepsie , Fred Corcoran started explaining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apart from all the static others . We were almost to Toledo by the time he had finished . In the first place , Fred explained , there was May 's business acumen , which was on the order of an Armenian rug peddler 's . ( For the record , May had started out in business life as a Bible salesman . ) His tournament philosophy was decidedly left of the USGA , whom he regarded as senile , and decidedly right of the PGA , whom he regarded as juvenile . In May 's twofisted estimation , the USGA wanted to hold tournaments for the benefit of amateur golfers , the PGA for the benefit of professional golfers . May did n't want to hold benefits 94 Tournaments , Chicago Style for anybody , and he saw no sense in catering just to golfers , amateur or professional . May wanted to hold tournaments essentially for nongolfers . The golfers would come , anyway . He wanted to sell tickets to the man in the street ? the mechanic , the file clerk , the bus driver ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played golf , and probably never would , and who wanted some sylvan relief from the asphalt atmosphere in which they lived , who wanted something grander and greener than what they found at Comiskey Park or Wrigley Field in the middle of August , who wanted , in short , a touch of plutocracy in their lives , even if it was only for an afternoon at Tam 0 ' Shanter , way out t here in the country , in Niles , where nobody worked for a living . Actually , Niles sits near the end of Cicero Avenue , not a dozen miles from the Loop . But when you worked in a steel mill in Gary in 1952 , it seemed as idyllic as Lake Forest or some other plush exurb . To get these people , May charged the most benevolent price he could think of for a tournament ticket ? a dollar . Sometimes he did n't even charge that . To get spectators on the property at all costs , he would tear out a section of a suburban phone book ? say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countless assistants to mail each name in it a free ticket . As though that were not grandiose enough , he might hire an airplane to drop five thousand tickets over Hammond or East Chicago , where golf courses are scarcer than polo fields . " Hell , " he used to say , " I ca n't sell those people hot dogs and beer if they 're downtown . " Once inside the gate with his ticket , paid for or not , a 95 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large spectator had the run of the club , which had more bars , inside and out , than a VFW lodge on Armistice Day . Dining rooms were everywhere , and they were open to the public . If that was too rich for your blood , hamburgers were sixty cents apiece and so good that today they 'd have to sell for three dollars . Since most of the spectators did n't know Sam Snead from Sam Sausage , May required all his contestants to wear numbers on their backs , practically on their backsides , to be precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notably Ben Hogan , but they came around as the years went by , and first prize rose from $ i o , 000 to $ i I , 000 , then $ 12,500 , $25,000 , and finally $50,000 . " For that kind of money , " Jimmy Demaret told the press , " I 'd wear a skirt . " Innocent as they were of golf , large segments of the gallery assumed golf courses were perpetually green , even in the middle of August . May saw to it that they were not disappointed . Early every morning , before anybody arrived , he had the putting surfaces and burnt-out patches of fairway sprayed with green vegetable dye . To make sure everybody knew exactly what was going on during play , May augmented the standard signboards that accompanied every threesome with six huge scoreboards scattered about the course . These were kept up to date via telephones , which had been permanently installed on every tee , and with walkie-talkies , manned , no less , by United States Marines , who were pleased at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We take such spectator services for granted today , but May thought of them years before they were used at other events , even the Masters Tournament , whose director , 96 Tournaments , Chicago Style Clifford Roberts , was one of the World 's Championship 's closest observers . Much of what you see today at major tournaments and national championships was originally engineered by George S. May ? for some reason , he was always referred to with his middle initial ? whom the USGA and R and A looked down their noses at and whom the PGA , to its eventual regret , would later think was too big for his britches . Not the least of his innovations was the construction of grandstands . When someone pointed out that it was a tradition in golf for spectators to stand up , May gave him the sort of sour look you might expect from a man who wore Hawaiian shirts with double-breasted suits . To attract Chicago 's various ethnic groups , May filled the fields with professionals from Mexico , Brazil , Argentina , Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional golf nations , such as England and Scotland . All their expenses were paid . For the purists in the gallery , May simultaneously ran an amateur event , which was almost invariably won by Frank Stranahan , and a ladies ' open event , title to which was usually handed back and forth between Patty Berg , who was immensely popular in the area , and Babe Zaharias , who was the most popular woman golfer ever . She had to be . She was represented by Fred Corcoran , and , for the edification of newspapermen , he laced her biography with anecdotes , some of which actually happened to her . At the World 's one year , a wiseacre columnist asked her if she wore a girdle on the course . " Whaddya think I am ? " the Babe replied , " A sissy ? " That kind of talk went over big in a town so tough some men wear tweed suits and no underwear . 97 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large Among the phenomena May introduced to country clubs was the minimum house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that each member was required to spend so much each month at the club , or be billed for it whether he spent it or not , thereby guaranteeing that every member was active . He was also the first to see the vast potential revenue in golf carts . When I first went to Tam 0 ' Shanter , carts were haltingly in use around the country , many of them being owned and maintained just by wealthier members . May had a barnful of them , all of which he owned and which a member was required to rent if he wanted to play at all . The mandatory cart , of course , is now a standard practice all over America , and a good many other places besides . Most people who can remember the World 's Championship today remember it most vividly for the hundredand-seven-yard wedge shot Lew Worsham sank on the last hole in 1953 for an eagle-two to win by a single stroke . It was the first time golf had been carried nationally on TV . But by then May was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , during prime time , May flabbergasted its management by having the entire eighteenth hole at Tam 0 ' Shanter wired for arc lights . Soon afterward he had the show syndicated through his own network , with outlets in St. Louis , Detroit , and Denver , among other major cities . The TV industry itself was just too slow for George S. May . May hired a number of executive-style professionals , one of whom , Lou Strong , went on to become a PGA president . But his showcase pro was Lloyd Mangrum , 98 Tournaments , Chicago Style who had won the United States Open in 1946 and the World 's two years later . Mangrum was May 's kind of pro ? tough , acid-tongued , a gambler by instinct . He had first been impressed by Mangrum when May laid him onehundred-to-one odds that he could n't make a birdie on a certain particularly tough par-four hole . Mangrum birdied it for $ t , 000 . Thereafter , May paid Mangrum a $ i , 000 bonus for every tournament he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kind of boss . In the winter of 1946 , the clubhouse at Tam 0 ' Shanter had burned to the ground . In it was the USGA 's trophy for the Open Championship , on loan to Mangrum who , in turn , had loaned it to May for display . It was totally destroyed . After an exact replica had been made , May had a new trophy made for the World 's Championship . It was about ten times the size of the USGA 's , and was said at the time to be the largest cup-trophy ever put together . When Henry Ransom won the World 's in 1950 , a picture was printed throughout the country with Ransom 's son standing in it . " You could have bathed a Shetland pony in it , " says Herb Graffis , the eighty-eight-year-old former columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times . " I do n't know what it cost then . But I 'd have to take off my shoes to count what it 's worth today . I do n't have enough fingers . " Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western Golf Association , to whom May left its care . Although a reward was offered for its return , all tips on its whereabouts have so far proved to be fruitless . When other tournaments were advertising their events by nailing posters to telephone poles , May was taking out full-page ads in the Chicago Tribune . He may have " pa-99 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large pered the house , " as they say in show biz , by sending ducats to names in the phone book and by throwing them out of airplanes . But he brought big-league golf to the people or , as Bob Harlow , publisher of Golf World , put it , " He took the game away from the Scottish peasants and gave it to the American peasants . " Later , May himself told me who it was who came to his golf extravaganzas . His galleries for a week could exceed one hundred thousand , or twice what any other golf event drew . He estimated that three fourths of them had never seen the pros play before , that half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a third of them had never played golf in their lives . Prophetically , those are almost precisely the figures given to me by a producer when I asked him to estimate the average TV audience not long ago . In 1958 , just four years before he died at age seventytwo , May abandoned the World 's Championship very suddenly . There were all sorts of rumors why , but the main one was that he had become fed up with the PGA , who , gallingly enough , was trying to tell him how to run a golf tournament . But somehow I never completely bought that reason . True enough , the PGA has had a number of officers whose IQs were n't much higher than their golf scores , but the bulk of them were pretty good at arithmetic . No , he was too fast for them , too far ahead of the Tour 's times . So it is not altogether true that nobody dreamed of today 's purses , for George S. May did . And he was wide awake when he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I N G the United States Open at Inverness in 1979 , I could n't help overhearing two college girls sitting behind me on a grandstand . Apparently neither girl played golf , and both were enjoying a tournament for perhaps the first time . The were discussing golf stars of the past whose pictures they had run across in the program , and the conversation was becoming ludicrous . They were not sure Byron Nelson was still alive . But they felt certain Sam Snead was , for one of them had read his name in the papers not long ago . However , they were positive Ben f logan was dead ; he had been killed in some sort of accident years ago . At this point , I gagged . I turned around , excused myself for interrupting their conversation , and then politely explained that Nelson was alive and on the premises as a IOI CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large spectator , that Snead was still playing in tournaments , although not this one , and that Hogan was not only not dead but actively engaged as president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he has made his home all his life . Now enlightened , they thanked me in that way young ladies reserve for men who need no longer fear arousing passion in them , and went on their way . It dawned on me then that there now is a generation , and maybe half another , who could have no notion of what manner of man and golfer Ben Hogan was in his playing days , so I will try to explain without insulting the intelligence of those many who could never forget him . This requires my using the past tense , that being the only workable way you can put a historical figure who is still alive in proper perspective . For Hogan was a historical figure quite apart from his colossal golf game , the graph of his career having had so many ups and downs that it became a curiosity among even those who have never played the game of golf , something to be placed high on a shelf in the museums of our minds and brought down to be admired when we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Lancelot . Hogan won four United States Opens , two Masters Tournaments , two PGA Championships , and a British Open . That record needs no excuses , but it was still no measurement of the man as a golfer . Just bear in mind that the British Open was the only one he ever played in . Also , that he stopped playing in the PGA Championship after 1948 , five years before he reached the peak of his game , because his legs , weakened by an operation to save his life , made thirty-six-hole matches unthinkable . Also , 102 Memories of Ben Hogan that he was a factor in The Masters before Jack Nicklaus was born and after Nicklaus had won it . And , finally , that some people , including Hogan himself , believe he actually won a record five United States Opens , the uncounted fifth having been the Hale America Open , a USGA-sponsored tournament held in Chicago in 1942 that had the usual sectional qualifying , a new record of 1,540 entries , and the standard USGA medal awarded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in keeping with the nation 's war attitude , chose not to deem a championship . So there you have Ben Hogan 's golf game and his championship record ; Fred Astaire without a dance floor . Like everybody who has won a lot of tournaments , l logan came in second very many times . But to speak of l logan finishing second is to miss the historical mark of the man . Every pro likes second place if he ca n't finish first . Hogan hated it . That attitude is the gift he gave to professional golf , for it was an attitude that only Bobby Jones , the great amateur , could theretofore afford . Like Jones , Hogan did not come into golf just to win titles , collect records , or beat other golfers ? strange as that may sound . He came into the game to prove to himself and others how well this game could be played , by anyone , anywhere , an ambition he fulfilled to everybody 's satisfaction but his own . " I see no reason , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be played in eighteen birdies . Just because no one ever has does n't mean it ca n't be ( lone . " When I reminded Hogan of this quote once , years later , he confided to me that he had once had a dream during which he played a course in seventeen straight holes-in-103 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large one , only to have his tee shot to the eighteenth green lip out . " I was madder than hell , " he said , and he did not think it amusing that he had been . When Hogan 's body was wrapped in a cast from his shoulders to his ankles at the Hotel Dieu Hospital in El Paso after his grinding car accident in 1949 , he continued to play golf in his delirium , his wife , Valerie , once told me . He would go through the motions of gripping a club , twisting and turning his hands to get the proper purchase on it , and then he would make feint motions with an arm , as though waving back a gallery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your deathbed , you have come to play golf for something beyond money . Ben Hogan was and is the most intense man I have ever known at doing anything . I say this despite the fact I have laughed with him at a locker room story , listened to him wax sentimental at a banquet , and have even heard him make a wisecrack or two to a gallery . Until him , nobody in golf shot a 66 and then went out and practiced for three hours , and the stories of him slamming clubs into the turf over a shot that would have delighted anybody else are legion . He once told me ? no , complained to me ? that he had never broken 62 in a round . " Gosh , all those guys have done that , " he added . Out of curiosity , I looked up his low rounds in the record books . He had scored 62 five times in competition , four more times than anybody else then had . Some months later , I got wind that he had shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on it . Hogan scoffed . " It was an easy course , " he said . Playing a late-afternoon practice round with Buck Worsham before the New Orleans Open in 1948 , I noticed 104 Memories of Ben Hogan Hogan playing alone behind us . On the next tee , Buck and I stood aside and invited him to play through . Hogan insisted the three of us play out the round together , however . Under such circumstances , most name pros would only watch you swinging if they had no better place to look , there not being much they could be expected to learn studying a hot-dog player . To my discomfort , Hogan kept his eyes so riveted on me I could feel them . But never once did his eyes follow the flight of the ball . Nor did he say anything . My only explanation for this behavior is that he thought there might be something in my swing that might confirm something he might have been theorizing about in his own , something only he would have been aware of or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Hogan 's concentration was almost beyond belief . Just before the old Motor City Open in Detroit one year , I had had dinner with Ben and Valerie . The following day , I was standing with Valerie just inside the gallery ropes on the tee of one of the longer holes . Ben eased himself through the crowd and then stood beside the two of us , not saying a word . Nor did we , of course . When it was his turn to play , he addressed the ball in that dreadfully determined manner of his , like a man about to wrestle a bear , and then slammed out a shot that dropped into a particularly advantageous tuck of fairway I had not seen anybody else in an hour capable of reaching , let alone finding . That evening I was with the two of them again at dintier and I remarked about the tee shot . " Oh , " said Ben . " Did you see that drive ? Which side of the fairway were you on ? " Valerie , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in her soup . 105 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large George Fazio recalls being paired with Hogan at a tournament years ago during which George sank a fiveiron for an eagle-two . The applause from the gallery , naturally , was thunderous . On the next tee Ben pulled out a scorecard to write down Fazio 's score . " What did you have on that last hole , George ? " he asked . Hogan 's swing was often described as mechanical and scientific , as though it had been painstakingly put together piece by piece and part by part until it resembled some sci-fi contraption that was incapable of making a mistake . " It looks , " said a writer for Time magazine , " like a machine stamping out bottle caps . " Hogan 's swing did strongly suggest the mechanical from the results it got , but it had nowhere near as many complicated parts as others seemed to see in it , particularly those less gifted players who had to shake their heads at the shots it produced . It was as functional as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything it did . " Ben , " Arnold Palmer once observed , " even has his toenails going for him . " What subtracted from the aesthetics of Hogan 's swing was its inevitable comparison to Snead 's , which then had an animalistic grace all its own . But Sam 's swing , for all its balletic dimensions , had its idiosyncrasies , even technical flaws , whereas Ben 's had nothing idiosyncratic whatsoever . It was textbook all the way , although admittedly an advanced book . Once , while watching Ben practice , I sighted my forefinger underneath his chin . It never wavered off the tip in the full hour I watched him . Many pros will argue that a steady head position is pedantic , that in real life any number of outstanding players move their heads . But that is not the point here . The point is ro6 Memories of Ben Hogan that Ben did correctly everything we have known about the golf swing to be correct , and then beat all the individualists while doing it . When I stood directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days and which I did every chance I got , I had the feeling that the shot was nine tenths over with . He just had to go through the formality of swinging the club , so perfect was his alignment and so poised the promise of what was coming . At the address , he gave the impression he was defying you to knock him off balance . His forward press was almost imperceptible , and then he went into the fullest , most pronounced backswing anybody ever took , at the top of which you could almost see the slot he locked the clubhead into . But there was nothing systematic about all this , nothing you could conceivably call machinelike . It had flow , like a man winding up a bullwhip . Then he would crack off a shot with an extension through the ball so full that you questioned how he could still hold on to the club . If you persisted in watching the results of the shot , as practically everybody instinctively did , you would miss one of the wonders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther . He was so utterly in balance he gave the impression , as someone once said of Harry Vardon , that he could have played the same shot standing barefoot on a cake of ice . This was the only point at which Ben Hogan 's swing bore the least resemblance to San Snead 's , the difference between the two being largely a tatter of aesthetics . Color me crazy if you like , but I preferred Ben 's . There was nothing in Hogan 's game as such that you could conceivably call a weak spot , not even his putting , 107 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large which became notorious as he advanced into his forties , as everybody 's does , with occasional cases of the yips . " Nobody can begin to understand what the yips are like , " he told me , " unless you had been a good putter before you had them . " When he began to make headlines in 1940 , the year he won his first individual tournament ? he had won the Hershey Four-Ball with Vic Ghezzi in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in truth was about the same as Jimmy Demaret 's , which nobody ever wrote about . While considerable , Hogan 's length was magnified by his preaccident weight , which had been only 128 pounds . When you hang that on a five-foot , eight-inch frame , people have a tendency to read miracles into your tee shots . The truth is , Hogan was not as consistently long as Snead , to give one gigantic example , and certainly not as long as Jimmy Thomson ? and none of them was as long as a near-forgotten pro named Clarence Camber . Hogan simply played every club in the bag well , all of which had given him problems with the exception of the wedge , which somehow came easier to him . Demaret , who knows Hogan best and has played the most golf with him , thinks the most underestimated part of Hogan 's game was his ability to get out of trouble . " That sounds stupid , I know , " says Demaret , " because Ben was so seldom in trouble . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a ball out of jail . He must have had fifty ways of bending a ball around a tree . " For all its ups and downs , Hogan 's life could be divided into three chapters , if we look at only the golf part of it . Had he been starting out today , he would never have got past Chapter One ; his playing card on the Tour would have been taken away for poor performance . Hogan him-ro8 Memories of Ben Hogan self is not quite sure when he joined what was then the Tournament Circuit , but Ralph Guldahl recalls riding with him in a Model-T Ford to an event in St. Louis as far back as 1929 , when Hogan would have been seventeen . That means he played eleven years before he won his first tournament , as noted , in 1940 , which is where Chapter Two may be said to have begun . He won his second the week after that and his third the week after that one , finishing the year as leading money-winner , a feat he duplicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps for three years . Steeped in arnica and Scotch , as are so many stories of how the pros survived during the Great Depression , many pros today would find it hard to believe that a pro as majestic as Hogan once had to survive on chocolate bars and hamburgers . But he did . Says Byron Nelson , who has known Hogan since they were caddies together , " Nobody had to work as hard to play golf as Ben . Nobody . " Hogan returned to the tournament scene in 1945 , winning five events , which were completely eclipsed by Nelson 's incredible nineteen , eleven of which were in a row . I Logan decided to take his swing apart and put it back together again . Something was missing . Good as his golf was , it was obviously not better than anybody else could play . Other pros , such as Demaret , were incredulous . But with the new swing , Hogan won two PGAs and , in 1948 , This first United States Open . Before we could see the full results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car accident early in 1949 . The results of it were discussed in newspapers for the remainder of the year , thus marking the end of Chapter Two . While his life had never been in the utter jeopardy 109 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large the papers made it out to be , it was a foregone conclusion that Hogan would never play tournament golf again , maybe no golf at all . And so began Chapter Three , the greatest of them all , in 1950 . Hogan won the United States Open at Merion while hobbling on a leg that had had its circulation rerouted by surgery . He won the Open again in 1951 over a revamped Oakland Hills that was so tough it had to be almost immediately softened up so the club champion could break 90 over it . Ben thought his final round of 67 , three under par , had been the finest of his career , and , because he thought so , many people thought it may well have been the finest round ever played by anybody , anywhere . Whatever it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire championship , and even Ben could not think of a shot he could have improved upon . Two years later , in 1953 , Hogan won every event he played in , which included the Masters Tournament , the United States Open , and the British Open , setting records in the process . It has been called the greatest year any golfer ever had , not excluding Nelson in 1945 and Bobby Jones in 1930 , the year of the Grand Slam . After Jones , people did not expect to see anybody like him again . And we have n't . I did not see Jones play in 1930 . But I saw Ben Hogan in 1953 . That is some years ago , and I have n't seen anybody like Hogan , either . Nor do I expect to . // F I R S T went to California from my native East in 1947 . Hardly anybody in those days flew from coast to coast , unless you had something to do with making movies . Most people took the train , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get around to ben . Amtrak goes bankrupt . So we drove . The drive was from Washington , D.C. , and our destination was Los Angeles , some three thousand miles with not an interstate or a turnpike or even a freeway in sight . There were just the two of us , Lew Worsham and myself , and we traveled in style . Lew had recently been given a Cadillac by his Washington friends for having won the National Open that year in a playoff against Sam Snead , and he had invited me to join him on what was called the III CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large Winter Tour by first trying to qualify for the Los Angeles Open . Lew and I spent our fourth night in Indio , which is southeast of Palm Springs on Route i o , twenty-two feet below sea level , at the foot of the Mojave Desert . It then had a population of about eight , some of whom could speak English . We could go no farther because a sandstorm had blasted the windshield to the stage where we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in an auto court , which is what they called a motel in those days . I had not been back to Indio until March 1981 , when I missed the exit for Indian Wells on Route to , which is now an interstate , on my way south from Los Angeles . Indio 's population is now fifteen thousand , all of whom can speak English , and it has more legitimate motels than Switzerland has hotels . It sits near the southern end of the Coachella Valley , which constitutes what most Easterners would call Palm Springs but which in fact now includes Rancho Mirage , Palm Desert , Indian Wells , La Quinta , Bermuda Dunes , Thousand Palms , Desert Hot Springs and , if you stretch your geography a bit , Yucca Valley . I mention all this because Indio now has two golf courses . When I was there last , it did n't even have a gas station . What has happened to Palm Springs ? When Lew Worsham and I drove through it , the whole valley had only one golf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before out of desperation by a bunch of sunstruck date-pickers , and even they had enough sense not to try to play it between May and October , when it gets hotter , as my Aunt Amanda used to say , than love in the kitchen . Now O'Donnell has been stretched to 5,269 112 California Casual yards , has a par of 70 , and entertains three hundred members who pay $85o a year dues to play all year except September , when it gets so hot even the dates wo n't grow . In addition , the valley has forty-three other golf clubs , three of which were opened just this year , and most of which are open for play all year , heat or no heat ? and I do not exaggerate when I say the temperature can hit a hundred twenty degrees . So you wo n't think that all those courses have been built , like O'Donnell , as sort of golf oases , let me point out that Canyon Country Club , which is in Palm Springs proper and was built in 1962 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four figures . Thunderbird Country Club , which is in Rancho Mirage and was built in 1951 , lets you in for $27,500 and is filled to capacity . And Eldorado Country Club , built in Indian Wells in 1958 , wants $40,000 SO you can sign your tabs and is holding at live hundred members . That 's not the kind of money you pay to play golf because you have grown tired of plucking dates . The Vintage Club , which is the one I was visiting , had just completed its golf course , the first of two to be built by George and Tom Fazio . Everything in Palm Springs exrept the barber shops has a guarded gate , and the one to The Vintage Club is flanked by a waterfall , the sort you would expect to see in Yosemite , behind which looms Iount Eisenhower . Nobody will say how much the golf course cost , possibly because they do n't know yet , but it is trageously beautiful , with almost as many gardens as New Jersey and several other man-made waterfalls , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hand because the ones on Mount Eisenhower 113 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large were n't artistic enough . When the clubhouse is finished , it is expected to be not quite as large as Radio City Music Hall . While it has n't been officially announced , the initiation fee is rumored to be about $50,000 . The force behind Palm Springs 's unparalleled golf facilities is , of course , real estate , as it has been all over the country since the Second World War . It 's getting so that a course designed with parallel fairways is considered to have made an ecological sacrifice , worthy of an award from the Sierra Club . At any rate , the million-dollar home in Palm Springs is no longer considered a showcase ; it 's almost the norm . Bob Hope 's latest home , among the three he now owns there , is said to have cost $6 million . If so , he got a bargain . It sits atop a minor mountain at the northwest corner of the valley , and you get to it through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese Army . The main living room has one side exposed to the outdoors . On a clear night , you can see Mexico City . It then soars a hundred feet into the air , at the top of which is a circular opening , perhaps thirty feet in diameter , through which you can study the stars . Inside is a fireplace large enough to burn a redwood . While the whole place might sound as though it were a backup for Mount Palomar , it does not have many rooms and is decorated in the lowkey , impeccable taste for which the Hopes are well known not only in Lotus Land but all over the world . I have not studied figures from the National Golf Foundation for years , but I do n't have to to know that California is now , and has been for some time , our grandest golf state . But where did all the golfers come from ? In my own time , it began right after the Second World War when a lot of former soldiers , sailors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wonder if they were not living in the East simply because their grandparents had got off the boat there . And so the exodus from East to West began . That makes sense for my time . But the truth is that California had been a golf entity long before then . That Californians could play world-class golf was evident as long ago as 1926 , when George Von Elm , who had moved to Los Angeles from Salt Lake City , defeated Bobby Jones , no less , in the final of that year 's National Amateur , at Baltusrol , in New Jersey . Then in 1934 and 1935 came Lawson Little , who had been born in Newport , Rhode Island , but had been raised in San Francisco . Little astounded knowledgeable golfers by capturing in those two years both the United States Amateur and the British Amateur back to back , winning an astronomical thirtyone straight matches before retiring in 1936 to play professionally . Little 's favorite golf course was Cypress Point , on the Del Monte Peninsula , where he lived later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership because of his professional standing ? which shows you how snobbishly Eastern they were getting even in the Golden West . But he knew splendid architecture when he saw it . While Pebble Beach is far more established in the Eastn psyche as a great golf course , it is mildly surprising w many more front-rank golfers who know their California golf prefer Cypress Point ? or simply " Cypress , " as they call it . I mean players like Harvie Ward , Bobby Gardner , and Frank Taylor , former Walker Cuppers who have played all over Britain as well as America and have t count of how many times they have played Cypress d Pebble . 115 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large Cypress is a catch-all of golfing oddities . In the first place , it was promoted by a woman , Marion Hollins , who had been our Women 's Amateur Champion in 1921 . Although there were many talented American architects in California even then , Miss Hollins decided on a British architect whose best-known work then had been in Australia and New Zealand . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had received degrees in medicine , chemistry , and natural science , Mackenzie served as a surgeon during the First World War , in the course of which he somehow became expert at camouflage . After the war he became disenchanted with surgery and turned to his passion for the outdoor life , which included dear stalking , hunting , fishing , and yachting , in addition to some near-scratch golf . With such an eclectic mind , golf architecture caught his fancy easily . In 1925 he immigrated to America and took on the Cypress job before eventually settling in nearby Santa Cruz . Cypress is known among those who take such esoterica seriously as being perhaps the only true championship layout in the world that could get away with having two par-fives and two par-threes back to back . The former are the fifth and sixth holes , and the latter are the fifteenth and sixteenth . ( As still another oddity , all four of Cypress 's par-fives are played before you reach the eleventh tee . ) Actually , Mackenzie never planned them that way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the land he had at his disposal , he might not have hesitated putting three par-fives back to back . The sixteenth hole at Cypress may be the most famous par-three in America , if not the world . It 's certainly the most photographed . You reach it by playing west on the rib California Casual par-four fourteenth , which lies along Fanshell Beach , then cutting into the cypress trees south to play the **28;131;TOOLONG fifteenth , which might strike you as a walking hole to the sixteenth tee were it not such an architectural gem itself . You play the sixteenth across a cove of Monterey Bay , the cliffs of which can drop sixty feet straight down when the tide is out , to a green that sits atop the point from which the course gets its name . The hole measures two hundred thirty-three yards , every inch of it carry , which accounts for the fact that only six holesin-one have ever been made on it , one of them by the late Bing Crosby , who for years had a home off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the members that nobody would ever ace the hole . Indeed , had he lived long enough ? he died in 1934 ? he would have been astounded that anybody ever drove the green , let alone holed out . For he had specifically designed the hole to be a par-four , not a par-three , and evidence of that fact is still there . As you pass a small grove of cypresses to your left on the way from the fifteenth green to what is now the sixteenth tee , you pass what is left of the tee Mackenzie outlined for what he intended to be a short par-four , about two hundred fifty yards in all , which in the twenties was an acceptable length for a drive-and-pitch hole . In point of fact , any architect will be quick , to testify that the hardest hole of golf there is to design imaginatively is a short parfour . With the sixteenth at Cypress , he created a classic ? a classic , that is , until some misguided members decided it should become an unconscionable par-three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you can say it has any par at all , as professional Hans Merrell might well rr7 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large ask . In the 1959 Crosby Tournament , Hans failed to carry the cove off the tee and took eighteen more strokes before he could get the ball into the cup . So there the hole sits , bastardized even more by an even newer tee created a few years ago , playing to a green that looks like a place Conrad Hilton forgot to build a hotel on . In 1929 , the United States Amateur was scheduled for the first time on the West Coast , it never previously having gone any farther west than Minneapolis , thereby busting the Eastern bastions of Massachusetts , New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania . The defending champion , as usual , was Bobby Jones , who had never been West , either . He and his newspaper sidekick , O. B. Keeler , rode the train from Atlanta to San Francisco , which took four days and three nights . In the very first round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaha named Johnny Goodman , the fifth of ten orphaned children , who was so hard up for cash he had had to travel to Pebble on a cattle car , using a pass supplied by a rancher friend from Nebraska . Awed not at all by Jones , if indeed he would ever be by anything , Goodman put Jones out of the championship , one hole or , if you insist , one-down . Goodman would go on to win the National Open in 1933 , and in 1937 he would win the National Amateur , this time traveling clear to Oregon to do it . In the meantime , though , Jones found himself three thousand miles from home now with nothing to do . So , quite naturally , he played golf at a different course almost every day , the course which quite naturally appealed to him the most turning out to be Cypress Point ? way more , in fact , than Pebble Beach . 1 r8 California Casual At Cypress , Jones met Mackenzie . So impressed was he by Mackenzie 's inherent good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once sacrificing the playability of a hole to make it more beautiful than it already was ? that Jones intimated to Mackenzie his unannounced plans to build a dream course of his own sometime in the not too distant future . Would Mackenzie be interested in helping with the architectural technicalities ? Nobody could refuse such a request from Bobby Jones . So it was that after Jones and his friends found Berckmans ' Nursery in Augusta , Georgia , the Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament , played over its smashing golf course , was born . There was one person , however , who was not at all pleased with how all this worked out so conveniently . This was Donald Ross , the already renowned architect from Pinehurst , North Carolina , who not without qualification considered himself not only the foremost architect in the Southeast but all America . He was miffed that Jones had not chosen him instead of Mackenzie . When he observed the principles on which Jones and Mackenzie were building Augusta National ? wide fairways , sparse rough , large greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially completed plans for the Number Four Course at the Pinehurst Country Club and combined it with the best features of t he old Number Two Course to give us the Number Two we know today as one of the supreme examples of golf course architecture in the world , some people say the supreme example . So there you have it . If a poor kid had n't hitched a ride on a cattle car to take on the greatest golfer of the day in 119 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large an eighteen-hole match clear across the country , then beat him against all sane odds , we would not today have two of the most famous courses there are , both of them three thousand miles from where it all happened . Golf indeed makes America seem smaller . 120 " CANNONBALL " F0R three years the name of W. Lawson Little was submitted to members of the Golf Writers Association of America for induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame in Pinehurst . A majority of two thirds of their votes was necessary , and for three straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought this failure was due to the fact that Little had played most of his championship golf as an amateur and that most of the newer , or younger , golf writers dismissed his career lightly because they mistakenly thought amateur golf had been in his day pretty much what it is today a kindergarten for the Tour . After the second year I began to think they thought that the people Little had beaten in collecting his five national trophies had not been very good . After the third year it began to 121 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large dawn on me that perhaps they simply did not know or care who Little had been . In less than a generation , he seemed to have been forgotten . Well , I , too , have troubles with my memory . I often wonder what ever happened to Bobby Breen , I 'm still not sure if " Wrong Way " Corrigan was on the level , and I am a bit hazy as to whether or not they finally caught the Black Dahlia . But one thing about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little was a real personality and a hell of a player , and any hall for persons famous in golf that does not include him ought to turn itself into a bus depot . Lawson Little was the greatest match player in the history of golf . Indeed , it would be difficult to construct an argument that says he was n't . In 1934 he won the British Amateur and then the United States Amateur . The following year , he won them both again . In 1936 , he turned professional , thereby leaving both titles undefended . Counting a singles match he won during the intervening Walker Cup competition , he had won thirty-two consecutive matches in international competition during those two years , leaving to fantasy just how long his incredible streak might have continued . There seems to have been little doubt that it would have continued for quite a while . To Bernard Darwin , who even then had been writing about golf for half a century , Little was a " man of destiny . " In a word not usually bandied about by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To put Little 's streak of consecutive matches in its proper perspective , it might help to point out that the best known previous record had been held by Walter Hagen , this at twenty-two , ten less than Little 's , and that the 122 " Cannonball " longest string Bobby Jones had been able to put together had been fourteen , or eighteen less than Little 's . And both Hagen and Jones had been beaten . Little was never beaten and had simply walked away from the table while the dice were still hot . Since then , the next best record has been set by Michael Bonallack in winning the British Amateur three straight times , a record in itself , from 1968 through 1970 , during which he won twenty-four straight matches . I can not determine in what round he lost in 1971 , but even if he had gone on to cop the title a fourth straight , incredible time , he could only have tied Little . As a professional , Little went on to win tournaments sporadically , the highlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the National Open at Canterbury , near Cleveland , by defeating Gene Sarazen , in a head-tohead playoff , characteristically , by three strokes , 70 to 73 . The first tournament he won as a professional was the Canadian Open in 1936 , when he tore to feathers the St. Andrews course in Toronto with a 271 , seventeen under par , a record score that was all but unheard of in those days . His last win came in 1948 at the St. Petersburg Open , although he came close again in 1952 , finishing second in the Insurance City Open at Hartford . He was then fortytwo and had been playing in national championships for twenty-three years . He finished out his days in his home on the Del Monte Peninsula , in California , where he died in 1968 . Little , who signed his name " W. Lawson " but never used his real first name of William , was an imposing figure with either a golf club in his hand or a martini , at which he was something of a record-setter also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could raise his own 123 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large olives . ) A burly man and incongruously barrel-chested for a golfer , he looked a lot larger than he actually was , which was no more than six feet and not much more than two hundred pounds . Handsome , he had deep-set eyes , thin lips , and a senatorial mane of dark , wavy hair , which he was constantly brushing back with his hand , even when he was indoors , and he was never known to go outdoors except to play golf . He could extract more showmanship out of the process of taking out , lighting up , and smoking a cigarette than could either Peter Lorre or Charles Boyer . On the golf course he walked as though he owned the mortgage on it ? slowly , deliberately , possessively ? with his brow furrowed and his eyes piercing into the distance , like a man who had been looking out to sea too long . If you had never seen Lawson before in your life and did n't know who he was , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that imperative presence some people have , as though everything they have just done , are doing , or are about to do is very important . Argumentative , bullheaded , he was nevertheless obviously a man of intelligence . Nobody ever won an argument over The Rules of Golf with Lawson , and he did n't need a copy of the Rules to defend himself , either . He had them memorized , chapter and verse . There were a number of reasons Little 's career as a professional was relatively lackluster , his National Open , of course , excepted . After winning a tournament , for one thing , he was often too busy celebrating to win the next one or perhaps even the one after that , or maybe too busy even to enter it . For another thing , he was making incalculably more money off the golf course than he was on it . Every dime he won in tournaments or earned through ex-124 " Cannonball " hibitions he used to play the stock market , at which Jack Burke , Jr. , his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far more clever than at golf . " We were the only two guys traveling together on the Tour then who did n't fight in the morning to see who got the sports section of the paper first , " Burke recalls . " Lawson did n't want it . You just handed him the financial page and he 'd be happy for hours . Maybe after breakfast , driving out to the course or something , he 'd casually ask you who was leading the tournament . I do n't know how the man played as well as he did . He never practiced . Sometimes he did n't even finish a practice round . He either had it ' that week or he did n't . But when he did have it , ' it was lights out . At St. Pete in 1948 , the man was in a trance . He knew he was going to win and nothing was going to stop him . You could say one thing for Lawson Little . He never choked in his life . Never once did he lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's golf game was not known for any particular strength or weakness , mainly because every department of it was tournament tight . He was a brilliant putter , marvelously inventive at recoveries with chips and pitches , and , by the standards of the day , an enormous hitter , his reputation for which earned him the nickname of " Cannonball . " In his singles match during the Walker Cup matches at St. Andrews in 1934 , Little was paired against Cyril Tolley , then world-famous as the longest driver in British golf , amateur or professional . Little made him look like a drunk at a driving range . With his wide , full turn on the backswing and a gorgeously balanced follow-through , Little hit balls off the tees as though they were drones coming out of a silo . When they got to where 125 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large Tolley 's ball had come to rest , they were a hundred feet in the air . Twenty-three and all but unknown outside his native California , he hopelessly outclassed the vastly more experienced Tolley six and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest bit of attention to was Tommy Armour , who had groomed Little 's game for his two " Little Slams " ? the United States and British Amateur titles . Armour had set Little up in such a way that the ball was played well back toward his right foot . The result was that when Little was wild , he was very wild . On the other hand , in Jack Burke 's opinion , it accounted for Little 's superb capacity for playing in foul weather . In 1941 , it was so cold at Brackenridge Park in San Antonio for the first round of the Texas Open that bonfires were built on the greens to help keep them from freezing . A widely printed picture of them was sent across the AP wires . Little shot the course that day in 62 . He never looked back and won the tournament handily . Because of the weirdly wild shots he often hit ? which did n't seem to perturb Little in the least ? he developed a wide array of odd recovery shots that other pros could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone attempt in a tournament . At scrambling and cheating the elements , he was the utter virtuoso . When , in the winter of 1948 , the PGA decided to go along with the USGA and reduce the number of clubs one could carry from sixteen to fourteen , Little was disgusted . I was with him that night at his hotel room , in New Orleans . He was propped up in bed wearing a magnificent kimono , the inevitable cigarette in one hand and a powder-dry martini in the other , holding court for anybody who would listen , like some latter-day mandarin . " What 's the sense in limiting the number of 126 " Cannonball " clubs a man can use ? " he asked rhetorically . " That 's like telling a singer he can only use so many notes on the scale . Christ , you would n't be able to tell a Caruso from a choirboy . If a man can use sixteen clubs , or twenty clubs , let him . " It might be worth mentioning that when Lawson won his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little packed not just sixteen , but a grand , incomprehensible total of twenty-six . " He looked , " said the late Dan Topping , who played at St. Annes in 1935 , " as though he had come to perform an exhibition of trick shots . But before the week was over , he had used every club in his bag . " No golfer can be judged out of the context of his own times in this constantly superannuating game . And the times when Lawson Little came upon the scene were those when American golf was on the verge of the biggest change in its history . Of the past nineteen National Open Championships , eight had been won by amateurs : Francis Ouimet , Jerry Travers , Chick Evans , Johnny Goodman , and the incomparable Bobby Jones four times . Jones had now retired , and while neither Hagen nor Gene Sarazen ever won a championship in which Jones had been entered since 1923 , Hagen was now wearily hauling himself over the hill and Sarazen , by virtue of winning both the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobody could practice for profit . Paul Runyan would be leading money-winner in 1934. with $6 , - 767 , Johnny Revolta in 1935 with $9,543 , and Horton Smith in 1936 with $7,682 . " The public was n't interested in the premier player then , " notes Burke , whose father had been both a famous teacher and a player before and during the Depression . " They were only interested in a 127 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large premier instructor . If you could n't get the president of the club out of his slice , you could blow your job . The only reason you played on what passed for the Tour was to get away from looking at him . Pro golf was a Mexican standoff . " Sam Snead was still in the hills of Virginia . Ben Hogan jumped on the Tour only so long as he had change enough for hamburgers and Hershey bars . Byron Nelson would win a total of $934 in 1934 . And Jimmy Demaret , who literally often had to sing for his supper , was playing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of turning pro never crossed Lawson Little 's mind , nor that of thousands of other amateurs who played often brilliant golf only because it helped them eke out a living peddling insurance or stocks and bonds . Remember : Coffee was a dime , the subway a nickel , the Daily News two cents . While Little 's family was hardly on the dole ? his father had risen to the rank of colonel in the Army Medical Corps ? he had only been able to play in the British Amateur in 1934 because the USGA had paid his expenses as a member of the Walker Cup team . Although he was a graduate of Stanford , he was n't really trained for anything . So he played amateur golf , like crazy . " I never knew what I wanted to do with my life until I was twenty-six , " he told me . By the time he was twenty-six , Little had completed his two " Little Slams , " as the newspapers referred to them . Then he was offered a contract by A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was to play a long series of coast-to-coast exhibitions with Horton Smith , Harry Cooper , and Jimmy Thomson . 128 " Cannonball " Now that he was a professional , Little was faced with another quandary that becomes clear only in retrospect . There were no titles by which he could carve out a reputation for himself of any lasting value . He was ineligible for the PGA Championship until 1942 , by which time he was a lieutenant commander in the Navy . The Masters Tournament was still nothing more than an informal get-together of Bob Jones 's friends and was not considered a particular feather in anybody 's cap ; indeed , would not be until after the war . The British Open was canceled for six years and would not be considered of any sentimental value to American professionals until after Hogan won in 1953 , by which time Little 's game had faded , nor of any commercial value until Arnold Palmer won it in 1961 , by which time Little had quit playing the game altogether . But there was no taking away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you were obtuse enough to overlook his National Open . Like Bobby Jones 's Grand Slam , it is about as unapproachable as a golf record can be . And he won them in every conceivable manner . Against a nineteen-year-old named Rufus King in the first round of the 1935 National Amateur at The Country Club in Cleveland , Little stood three down after five holes despite the fact he was one under par . King had been four under . Undismayed , Little closed out the match in only eleven more holes . In the final against Scotsman Jimmy Wallace at Prestwick in 1934 , Little played the morning round in 66 , which was six under what was estimated as par in those days , the British then preferring to keep score according to how a player stood with even fours . He played the first five holes of the afternoon in 129 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large three under , making him eleven under altogether for the twenty-three holes the match lasted , winning fourteen and thirteen . In those twenty-three holes , he stood ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it any wonder , then , that nobody could beat him ? And nobody ever did beat Lawson Little ? except Lawson Little . // ON TOUR H E N he awoke that morning , it was six o'clock and still dark . Jack Tuthill switched on the light next to his bed . It was another bed in another motel room in another town just like the forty others he goes to every year , a routine he has been following for a fourth of his life . It was Thursday , tournament day , and he had to be at the golf course in an hour . Because keeping his cool is so much a part of his job that he habitually never rushes , not quickly but deliberately Tuthill pulled himself out of bed , climbed into a steaming shower , and carefully shaved with the precision of a man sculpting a bust of himself . Then he put on what has become almost his uniform of the day : double-knit slacks in a houndstooth pattern of black and red , a white polo shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soles , and a maroon blazer . Over the breast pocket was the official emblem of the Professional Golfers Association , Tournament Players Division . Underneath it was stitched the words Tournament Director . Showered , shaved , and suited , Jack Tuthill walked down the quiet corridors of his motel to the lobby . Not surprisingly , the dining room was n't yet opened , nor was the breakfast bar . Tuthill shrugged his shoulders . When will they ever learn , he said to himself , that professional golfers are n't nine-to-five people ? At the golf course , Jack went immediately to the trailer that is set aside at each tournament for PGA officials . In the trailer a lady marker , or scorekeeper , served Tuthill a sweet roll and a paper cup of coffee . It would have to last him till lunch , six hours away . Tuthill opened his outsized attache case and removed a walkie-talkie marked with his name . From the time he arrives at the course until the moment he leaves , it is never out of his hands . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tournament Players Division plus the local tournament director and the head greenkeeper . Tuthill 's first order of business was to check with the greenkeeper on the condition of the course . He pushed the TALK button on his walkie-talkie . " Bill , this is Jack , " he said . " Can you read me ? " There were a few seconds of silence . " Right , Jack , " came a voice as though by shortwave . " I 'm on thirteen fairway . " " Any problems ? " said Tuthill . " Nothing that ca n't be taken care of , " said Bill . " There 's an underground leak in the sprinkler system out here that 's causing a water bubble . I ca n't get it fixed until 132 A Day in a Life on Tour tonight . I think you better have somebody come out here and mark it as ground-under-repair . " " Okay , " said Tuthill . It was nearing eight o'clock , time for the first threesome to tee off . Tuthill climbed into his cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being handed their scorecards by Marty Brown , the official starter . It has become the custom among touring pros to sign their scorecards before they tee off , not after they finish play , thereby eliminating the possibility of a penalty or disqualification . These three did that . With a few minutes to go , they engaged in small talk with Tuthill . Nobody shook hands or even said hello . People who travel the tournament circuit regard each course , each motel , each city as business as usual at the same old stand . Despite the fact that the last city was eight hundred miles away , formal greetings were regarded as superfluous . It would be like shaking hands with your business partner on Monday morning because you had n't seen him since Friday afternoon . An hour passed . Thunderheads appeared on the horizon . Tuthill parked his cart and marched into the clubhouse and up a flight of stairs to a balcony . He began to stare at what appeared to be a storm coming out of the south . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Showers or dew do n't bother these guys . But I have to think in terms of lightning . A dozen people a year are killed by lightning on golf courses in this country , and I do n't intend to ever let it happen here . " He pushed the button on his walkie-talkie . " Who 's in the office ? " he said . " I am , " said a static voice . It was Mark Thomas , a TPD official . 133 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large " Mark , " said Tuthill , " can you check with that radar station to see what kind of a storm is coming up ? I do n't like the looks of it here . " " Right , " said Thomas . Tuthill sat in silence for a minute , waiting for the report . The sun was shining brilliantly now , at nine o'clock , but the players could n't see the blackness that was forming in the south . " I 've seen these things come in from nowhere , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonial , a few years ago . It was a beautiful day . But I called the nearest radar station ? we make an agreement with one at every tournament because local weather bureaus are hours behind time to see what the prognosis was . It was terrible . So I had the sirens wound up . The whole field thought I was crazy . Within ten minutes there was the worst lightning storm you ever saw . It rained constantly for three days . " Tuthill 's walkie-talkie cackled . It was Mark Thomas back with a report . " Not good , " he said . " There 's electricity up there . " " Okay , " said Tuthill . " Sound the sirens . " Police cars had been strategically placed around the course so that the siren of one would be picked up and then relayed around the course by another . Tuthill went back to his trailer-office . There was a message that Joe Dey , then the TPD commissioner , was on the grounds and would catch up to him somewhere . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longtime professional who was now working as the TPD 's " advance man . " Three , four , even six weeks in advance , Raynor checks that courses scheduled for TPD events are up to the TPD 's snuff . Tuthill returned the call , and discovered 134 A Day in a Life on Tour to his satisfaction that a tournament site five weeks hence was in good if not perfect condition , that the local tournament director was on the ball , and that all the other myriad details that are handled by unpaid committee members had been handled as well as could be expected . It rained for two hours , then stopped as unexpectedly as it had begun . The sun was now high in the sky , hot as a fever . Tuthill began getting walkie-talkie messages from all over the course . Players wanted to know why they could n't continue play . " Wait ten minutes , " Tuthill told them , " then sound the sirens again . I can still see lightning to the north . I do n't want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The storm did not return . Jack Tuthill was then forty-nine , but he looked years younger . His background for his job is not all that plain , mainly because there had been no precedent for it until he was hired by the PGA a little over twelve years before . He had served a stint as an FBI agent in the early fifties and was working as an investigator in labor relations for the state of New York when the PGA was still trying to define the sort of man they wanted to represent them on the tournament circuit . Tuthill was approached by a tournament player he knew , then serving as a representative of those pros who play for a living rather than serve as club pros . " I was n't quite sure what the job was all about , " Tuthill says . " I was living on Long Island at the time and bored silly with my job . This offer sounded exciting , although it meant a great deal of traveling . My wife , Dorothy , and I talked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do , it still would not 135 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large amount to what most successful salesmen do nor , for that matter , add up to the time most commuters in our neighborhood spent away from their families . " The result was that I was approved for the job , took it , and soon after moved to Pensacola . I now actually live in Lillian , Alabama , but that 's only ten miles from Pensacola 's airport , just across Perdido Bay . That may seem like a funny place to live for a director of tournaments that go from coast to coast . But twenty-two to twenty-five tournaments a year are played within an eight-hundred-mile radius of my home . Consequently , I spend six months a year traveling by myself , getting home when I can and allowing Dorothy to join me when she can with our daughter . Then there are a hundred days per year I am allowed to take for vacation , which I spread out over the calendar . During the summer , when our daughter is out of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months when they can travel with me . " The result is that I travel about forty thousand miles a year . I know plenty of businessmen who travel more than that . And how about some of the pros ? Like Gary Player . Gary travels five times more than I do . ' Course I have to do most of mine by car , with all the junk I have to haul around ? record papers , for example ? that the average pro does n't need . " Tuthill 's walkie-talkie started cackling again . A rules decision was needed on number eight . " Okay , " he said . Then , " Mark , are you there ? " It was Mark Thomas 's assignment that day to cover the front nine . The back nine would be handled by Clyde Mangum . But a lot of overlapping would happen as the field progressed . Each would back the other up . If a really sticky situation arose , Tuthill 13 6 A Day in a Life on Tour would race to the scene . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world knows more about The Rules of Golf than Jack Tuthill . One of those situations arose in midafternoon . A young-and-coming pro was in a bunker on thirteen . His ball was in the sand , lying so close to the bank that he had no chance of reaching the green , which was a hundred sixty yards away , all of it carry . He wanted relief , the young man said , because the sand was full of the trails of some kind of bug . Both Thomas and Mangum were on the scene when Tuthill got there , racing his cart through a dozen shortcuts that probably even the members did n't know existed . Parking his cart in the rough behind a huge oak tree , so that it would be out of play for the following threesome , Tuthill strode across the fairway and examined the problem . Two groups had played through , and another was about to reach the tee behind them . A decision had to be made immediately . " That may be a bug , " he told the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So let 's play golf and get going . " Tuthill marched back to his cart , walkie-talkie in hand . He slumped into his seat . " Christ , I hate to do that , " he said . " That kid is a hell of a player . He 's only twenty-six and already he 's won two tournaments . He might even win this one . But there are a hundred ten other guys out there who want to finish in the money . Every time I make a Rules decision , I have to think of them . That kid wanted relief from a bad lie , so he pulled the Book on us . Burrowing animal ! Jesus , I wish they 'd throw that Rule out of the game . How the hell are you going to tell a pro who makes 137 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large a hundred grand a year the difference between an ant and a mole when the decision you make might cost him ten thousand dollars ? I mean , where do the Rules begin and end ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello ? " he said to anybody who might be listening . " This is Tuthill . Anything going on in the trailer ? " A voice came back . It was the lady who had served him doughnuts and coffee nine hours ago . " Yes , " she said . " You 've had a number of long-distance phone calls . A Mr. so-and-so called ... " " Thank you , " said Tuthill . " Never mind the names or the numbers . I 'm on my way over . " Tuthill pushed the accelerator to the floor . He weaved his way through the trees on thirteen , skirted fourteen green , and barreled down a service road that parallels fifteen fairway . A very famous pro was playing fifteen with a leading money-winner and a kid pro who had won his first tournament two weeks ago . The kid had hooked his tee shot into the rough into what looked like a lie that might be unplayable . Tuthill slammed on the brakes , took a sharp left-hand turn , and weaved his way through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rough about twenty yards behind the young pro 's lie . It was not unplayable . Tuthill relaxed , his walkie-talkie in his lap . The young pro was walking so fast he was almost jogging . He never so much as glanced at Tuthill . Instead , he surveyed the bad lie he had and then , as though he were Napoleon studying the Russian border , he examined his yardage card and took a hundred steps toward the green , then another back to his ball . 138 A Day in a Life on Tour The very famous pro walked over to Tuthill . No amenities were exchanged . " Look , Jack , " he said . " I ca n't say anything to this boy . You know why . He 'll think I 'm trying to knock him out of the box . Listen , I hope he wins a million dollars ! But somebody has to tell him to play faster . It took us half an hour to play the eleventh hole ! " " Okay , " said Tuthill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nobody behind you waiting , and the other group is still on the green . What do you want me to do ? Penalize him because he 's playing bad ? Everybody does that . Even you . " The young pro got himself out of a bad lie into an even worse one . Eventually , he took a six . Tuthill shrugged his shoulders . He did n't say anything , but the expression on his face was one of compassion . " Every guy out here is treated the same , " Tuthill said . " If you do n't think that way , then you have no business being a TPD official . When the PGA was played in Latrobe , Pennsylvania , which is Arnold Palmer 's hometown , I had to call two penalties on him . Needless to say , I was n't very popular in western Pennsylvania that week . But Arnie , being a real man , took both decisions in stride . He knows the Rules , and he knows that I know them . So there was n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't holding up play , Tuthill resumed his trip back to the trailer office . He made five long-distance calls , then chatted with Commissioner Dey for an hour . It was now seven o'clock and getting close to sundown . The two-hour delay because of rain had Tuthill concerned that all the field might not be able to finish . If all the field reached fifteen tee by dark , those still on the 139 CHARLES PRICE / Golfer-at-Large course would mark their balls and finish the round tomorrow morning . If they were really running late ? say , clear back to eleven or twelve ? Tuthill might be forced to cancel the entire round , wipe out every score posted , and start all over again the next morning . This is a situation no pro likes , unless he has been playing horribly . At eighteen green , Tuthill discovered that everybody was playing about as fast as could be expected ? four hours . There should be no problem . To be sure , though , he cruised down the last three holes in reverse order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers in the air , like Churchill 's V-for-victory sign . Every pro on the circuit knows what that means : Speed up play as much as possible . As it turned out , the last group had to finish in the dusk . It was either that or play in the dew the following morning . No pro likes to play in the dew . Tuthill returned to the trailer , disposed of his cart , and drove his station wagon back to the motel . He had a secret meeting with four members of the Tournament Policy Board : Deane Beman , Charles Coody , Lionel Hebert , and Bob Rosburg . It lasted an hour . Tuthill got to the dining room just before it closed . Clyde Mangum and another official , Pete Sesso , were just finishing their dinner but invited Tuthill to join them . The conversation , naturally , was all about golf in general , PGA golf in particular , TPD golf in specifics . After dinner , Tuthill went to his room , called his wife on the phone , then watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned off the light next to his bed . He was in another bed in another motel room in another town just like the forty others he goes to every year , a routine he has been following for a fourth of his life . 140
