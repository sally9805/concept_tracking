Sylvester Stallone <P> Hollywood , Calif . <P> Dear Sly , <P> We missed you here on the Cote d'Azur . The Cannes Film Festival thrives on glamour and muscle , and the expected appearance of Rocky-Rambo at the 39th installment could have provided both . It matters little that you may never have intended to show up . French commentators spoke scornfully of American stars so cowed by the paranoia blitz of the U.S. media that they refused to visit one of the world 's swankiest resort towns , sip champagne kirs , scarf down strawberries the size of winesap apples and be treated like pashas in a mythical movie monarchy . Too rough for Rambo ? C'est dommage . <P> The French had their revenge . First they ordained that the Cannes fortnight , cold and wet the past two years , would be blessed with picture-postcard days and balmy nights . Then , realizing they could not report on your presence , they determined to invent it . The festival 's hottest rumor had you lounging incognito at a beyond-posh hotel down the coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney Pollack , reversed a recent trend of awarding its top prize to a European art film and bestowed the Palme d'Or on an Anglo- American epic called The Mission  --  just the sort of lumbering white elephant most esteemed by the Hollywood moguls who finked out and stayed home . <P> As you may have heard , you were n't the only no-show at Cannes . Libyan commandos took two weeks off , and the only bombs here were on the screen . If there were any terrorists in town , they must have spent their days on the Carlton beach and their evenings dining at three-star restaurants , and are now , no doubt , back home trying to explain a bloated expense account to Abu Nidal . Meanwhile , the Cannes constabulary hovered inconspicuously and frisked all moviegoers , with special attention to attractive young women . This was a party , not a wake . On the festival 's opening day one TV network showed a local motorcade headed by eleven policemen balanced pyramid-style on their speeding cycles . Right this way , folks , the circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus , the Israeli-born moviemakers who run the Cannon Group . In Hollywood , of course , Golan and Globus are still thought of as a crass act , even though they recently signed you , Sly , to a $12 million movie deal . In Cannes they are seen as little guys who made good  --  the patron saints of every " independent producer " hustling nonexistent pictures from his tiny hotel room . So here is Menahem summoning the press to announce , " I have good news for you . We did n't buy anything today . " There is Yoram telling a TV interviewer of his passion for movies : " I wake up with cinema , I eat cinema , I sleep with cinema . " By the end of the festival , Golan had won no prizes , inspired a barrage of Menock-knock jokes and boasted that Cannon had done $100 million worth of business at Cannes . Imagine if it were real money .               @ @ @ @ @ @
