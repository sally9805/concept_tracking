coming toward her . She finished up her work quickly and did a nice little pirouette and doubled back to where he had been standing in the first place . Martin was caught midstream and looked around with an expression of panic and confusion . Nora watched with satisfaction as he stumbled and blushed , going one way and then the other , trying to recover , like a wobbly drunk attempting a straight line . He had his hands jammed inside his jacket pockets as if he could stiffen a soft backbone with enough push . All nerves , she thought  --  a cold battlefield judgment . She could not imagine what use Michael found in him , apart from the money and the contacts and the convenience , which were important but not crucial . The importanttrait was character . And in a pinch , she concluded , this one would crack like an egg . But Michael had his reasons . Besides , it was none of her affair . None at all . She waited until Martin came back around and stood in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic . Generations of proud , high-tempered Irish tenant farmers had learned to swallow their tongues rather than let loose a beheading rage . Let the other fellow explode ; let someone else reveal something weak , somethinghuman , like emotion . That was the tight-lipped lesson that was passed along from generation to generationlike the secret of fine stitching . The nervous little man ignored her small revenge and stood in front of her and waited a beat , as if he had n't been chasing her up and down the bar , as if he was n't entitled as her employer to some show of respect . He gave up the little game entirely . " Mary wo n't be in tonight , " he said with a smile worn out by too much leering.  |p21Nora  refused to take the hint , although the meaning of what he said was plain enough . She stared him down , forced him to his knees . " Her dad was in an accident , " he went on , leaving an opening that she would not take . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . She has to stay with him . Y'see . I thought I 'd give her the night . Poor thing . " She forced herself to let the little man suffer . He had earned it , made her suffer often enough . Then she saw something  --  a touch of resentment , a little flare of anger  --  whenshe would n't help him along . It came as a shock , something as noble as anger , from such a creature . " Would you mind working the tables , Nora Kate ? " he blurted out . " I would , " she fired back , leaving him , as she usually left him , tongue and jaw flapping in the wind . " Larry needs me at the bar . " Larry turned away . He had no appetite for involvementin a fight . He was a perfect bartender  --  a spectator . Martin stammered . " Uh , ah , well . " " I 'll tell you the truth , Martin , " said Nora , turning away , forcing him to bend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn like a slap , " I do n't like the tables . " " But , but , but ... " " It 's no picnic working the bar , I give you that . I do n't like getting pinched by all the young heroes who grow bold with ale . " She let that sink in . " But , then , as a matter of fact , the tips are better at the bar . And the way you pay me , I ca n't be too proud , can I ? " " I 'll make up the difference , Nora Kate . Whatever you lose in tips , I 'll see that it 's right . "  |p22She  turned and faced him , showing him the full voltageof her contempt . He started to say something , but she stopped him by raising her eyebrows . Then she let him off the hook . " I prefer the bar , Martin , but I 'll do the tables , " she said with an icy shrug . Martin was baffled . He read it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was more complicated than that . Nora was moved by an intricate sense of duty . Someone had to work the tables , and Nora Katherine Byrnes would not be the one to neglect the job . She would go , as all the women in her ancient line went , where she was needed . Martin would have said something , made some remarkto show his gratitude , but she was gone , whipping off the bar apron and replacing it with the one with pockets for the checks and the pencils . There were only a few couples at the tables . Not much hope for tips  --  and Martin would soon forget his promise to make it right , she was sure of that . But the tables would be a blessed rest for her weary mind . The couples came to sit and lose themselves under the spell of the old wood in the dining room of the old house converted into a pub . They were enchanted by the shamrock napkins and the rusted blunderbusses mounted on the walls alongside the long , thin smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find pipes like that in America . Some effort had been made to fill the dining room with touches of Old World sentiment . The bar , on the other hand , was a long , curved assemblyline for hard drinkers  --  all business . Deeply stained wood and worn-down ruts around the stools where two generations and more of laborers hadp23slumped into their whiskies after a long day on the docks or the high steel or running after crime in some far precinct or eating smoke in some doomed tenement . Nora was the latest generation of barmaids who caught the restless fallout of the blue-collar customers . It was hard work . You had to stay awake just for the dodge and banter . The soft boys with beer bellies liked to touch and tickle . But more than that , they demanded a quick and nimble wit from their barmaids . You had to answer their crude jokes with something saucy . You had to play the dumb Molly to their sad wag . " Now what 's this ? " she said , running into a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of the bar area . She was balancing a tray full of ale for the far table . " Woncha sing , Nora , darlin ' ? " asked the fellow with the lumber arm , a brute named Callan who was waiting for his appointment to the fire department , who was making himself obnoxious with nightly farewell parties . The other men at the bar , thick with their whiskey , had been accompanying the jukebox to " Finnegan 's Wake , " or some liquid facsimile ; now they stopped . They were waiting to see how she would handle the lunk . " Sing , Nora , dear . I could teach you one or two things about singing , " crooned Callan , turning to see the effect of his salty innuendo on the others . " I could really make you sing . " The others  --  all of whom had at one time or another taken an unsuccessful run at Nora  --  leaned closer to witness the precise manner in which Nora would fend off Callan . They were not disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from underneath in one crisp , upward motion . Callan was leaning on the arm and the sudden absence of support sent himp24sprawling . Nora stepped over him , then stopped and looked down with pity . " And I could turn you into a tenor , " she added brightly . The others at the bar erupted in appreciation . There was a lull in the dinner trade , and through the window of the Irish-style pub called the Shebeen , Nora could see the lights of the little boats nodding in Broad Channel , the little cove just off Jamaica Bay . She liked the look of small boats . She felt moved by them , so tiny and brave , riding gracefully in the chop of the sea . Like dancers , she thought whenever she caught sight of them through the window . Dancers bobbing on the cold stage of Jamaica Bay . She was , herself , a dancer , and knew the thankless sight of it . She took the lessons and performed the endless exercisesof a dancer . She disciplined herself and underwent denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never complained . Such was the price of being a dancer . It was not in her character to make a bargain with fate . She was a dancer and there was a price to it and that was that . Not that she ever expected to appear in public as a dancer . She did n't even expect anyone else  --  apart from her teacher  --  to know her true identity . She was a dancer , but not in this lifetime . There had been a chance . Once . A teacher in Belfast had seen something in her and said , Be a dancer . You could do it . The teacher had offered to send her to a special school , to arrange for scholarships . But even at seven she knew that it was impossible . She understood from the moment she was capable of grasping any lastingidea that she was shackled by hereditary obligations , practical chains of responsibility . She had a father in thep25king 's prison and a brother off God-knows-where and a mother dying of cancer . She obeyed the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forgotten , but kept like a sigh in the dark chest of her lost hopes . And she was a soldier . She bit back the resentment and tried not to hate her dying mother . The disappointment only showed up as a crease in her face . She learned to live with it . It was an old Catholic trick . If she could n't be a dancer in this lifetime , she would be one in the next . There was that spiritual dimension . She squeezed out the student fees and faithfully attended the lessons as if they were morning mass . She worked herself like a fanatic , keeping herself ready for the next life . Nora preparedand cleansed her body as she once prepared and cleansed her soul . As she gazed out of the window of the Shebeen , as she paused to admire the elegant movement of the small boats in the cove , one of the monster jets came roaring out of nearby Kennedy Airport , crushing all thought , all conversation . Like everyone else , Nora Kate thought that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in their arrogant thunder . But she was roused to frustration by their overpowering presence . They were , in their own way , like the British army bullies with their long rifles who came marching through the Catholicneighborhoods of Northern Ireland , smothering talk and spirits under the click of their rough boots . Nora turned away from the window . She busied herselfat the tables , picking up empty pitchers , writing down orders , almost  --  but not quite , never completely  --  lostin the automatic tempo of work . This is good exercise , she told herself . Dancers repeat the samep26monotonous movements until they ache with the automaticrepetition . Dancers learn to make even awkward steps look pretty . She was a dancer on the dining room floor . No one carried a tray full of beer with quite the proud , high style as did Nora . She would overhear , sometimes , someone remark on it . That woman should be a dancer . She swallowed the smile , and the reply : I am , you know . The pub was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like counting the house in the theater . Then a curious thought broke through her wandering mind : she was n't needed at the tables ; Martin could have gotten by without taking her off the bar . There was a reason . Intent . She could feel the conspiracy crawl up her spine . Suddenly , standing at the alcove near the kitchen door , cold sober , was the would-be fireman , Callan . " We need Michael , " he said , and she shivered at the memory of urgency . " What is it ? " she asked dumbly . It was an instinct . It just slipped out . He gave her a twisted look . As if to say , you should know better than to ask such a question . " Just get him , " he said impatiently . She nodded . A slip . Something weak slipped through my defenses . A human thing . Sorry . None of my business . Not anymore . As she walked away , Callan staggered a bit , just for the benefit of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll die a dry old maid , Nora Kate . " And for the benefit of the others , she called after him , chasing him with a quip : " I could think of worse fates . " She paused . " And so could your wife . "  |p27She  knew , as soon as she saw Callan standing sober in the alcove , that great sorrow was in the room . The foolish soldiers were rushing to arms , throwing themselves on grenades , killing and being killed  --  just from the straight-up sight of him . Oh , Callan , you silly bastard , I really do n't like you this way . I like you better as a plain , witless drunk . Callan took the wind out of her . She thought she had left them all behind in Belfast . Ireland was packed with sober boys drunk with foolish courage . This was why she left . She wanted to save her unbornchild from the doom and grinding hate of Ulster . She left because she came to see , at some ripe moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . None of it . Not the least little bit . She saw the injusticesand the implacability , she saw the cruel yoke , but she did n't see the point of suicide . The Troubles remained as much a mystery as the persistence of her religious faith . For , despite everything , she still found herself  --  at sad and troubled moments of her life  --  wanderinghelpless into a church , making choked and heartfeltconfessions to dull , uncomprehending priests . She told herself that she did n't believe  --  and that much she believed . Might as well talk to the blocks of stone left by the Druids . Might as well mumble dead prayers in a dead tongue to a dead God . She told herself as much . And yet her heart had its own convictions . When , one day , to her amazement and delight , she discovered that she was pregnant and unable to bring herself to submit to a back alley abortionist , she ended up in a dark pew with her knees bent and her cheeks wet , praying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con/flict . Finally , after all the other choices had run out , she went to her old maid aunts in Dublin in the South for sanctuary . They took her in , as they took her in when her mother died , but there was a price . They gave her shelterand provided sustenance , in that strict , grudging family manner that left it an open question whether it came from emotion or obligation . Still , they took her in when it counted , and in the final analysis that was what mattered . Nora might not have understood the depth and complexity of her ties to her family  --  or to Ireland , for that matter  --  but she did grasp one overwhelming truth : she had to get away . She had to leave for the sake of the child , and for something she had always identifiedvaguely as her own mortal soul . When she announced this to her aunts , the night she told them of her plans to come to America , she was in the last trimester of the scandalous pregnancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner table eating cold cabbage soup and stale bread . They ate in the deep , oppressive silence that was the principal language of the house . Bridget , the older of the two aunts , sat pinched and stiff , the spoon moving from her plate to her lips like a machine . She took in Nora 's news the same way she took in the cabbage soup  --  without any outward show of effect . Deidre , on the other hand , clutched her hands togetherunder her heart and made a sound like a whimper as she bit her lips . She stared at Bridget . No one spoke for what seemed like a long time . Finally , Bridget put down her spoon . " When is it you plan to go ? " she asked , her voice neutral , yet already full of condemnation . She stared atp29the unfinished bowl of soup . Her hands were clasped as if in prayer . " Soon , " replied Nora quickly , feeling the exhilaration of having passed the worst , grateful that they were discussingtactical matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for two seats . " She held her hands on her high belly . " I 'll smuggle him into America . " Bridget looked up . Her eyes were wide . The baby was not something that was discussed . Not openly . It was always some oblique , indirect matter : " When your time comes , " " You need a larger dress ; you are becomingapparent . " " You intend to go beforehand , then ? " said Bridget . " Why not ? We have modern air-o-planes . Be there before you leave . " She sensed that the discussion was not done . Bridget had guns to fire . Nora picked up her spoon and took another mouthful of soup and a bite of bread . It stuck like cement in her mouth . " And how will you get by in America ? " Nora shrugged . " I 'll work . I 'm not afraid of work . " " With a bastard in your belly ? " shot Bridget coldly . " With my baby . I 'll work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have the least idea , " she said . " Go off to America without a plan , without means , without a friend in the world . You do n't know what you 're getting into , do you ? " " No , " flung back Nora maliciously , " but I know what I 'll be gettin ' out of . " Her face flushed . She had not intended to be cruel . Bridget had taken her in . If she had n't been kind , it was because kindness was not in her nature . But she hadp30taken her in , and it was wrong to repay that with meanness . " I 'll be fine , Aunt Bridget . Really . They have doctors and hospitals and jobs in America . " Bridget sipped some water ; lubricating herself for the fight , thought Nora . " It sounds to me as if you had n't thought this through , " said Bridget . Nora was unprepared for an in-depth defense . She had expected disapproval and then sullen acceptance . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her aunts and did not grovel in shame and gratitude because she was unmarried and pregnant , Bridget smoldered silently . Her judgment was subtle : a moist sense of reproach , a head turned away quickly as a rebuke , the refusal to discuss directly the maternal fact . This was the limit . Bridget made her feelings known by mute , half-choked gestures and denial . Not Deidre . Unlike the wire-thin older aunt , Deidre had some flesh on her bones ; she had an endearing lack of willpower and a weakness for sweets and feelings that would not be denied . She spent long nights knitting baby things , grinning at Nora , signaling their great secret . " Have you thought of the child ? " said Bridget , softening , uttering the forbidden word . " Have you consideredgiving birth here ? " " No . Not here ! " cried Nora , sounding to herself like a petulant child . For that flicker of an instant , she could see how thismust sound to Bridget , how it would play against herno-nonsense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat back in the chair , thrusting up her bellylike a holy shield . " The child will be born in America . " Bridget shook her head . " No , " she said with uncannyp31certainty , " you 'll not be goin ' to America with the baby in your belly . " Nora felt a flutter of panic , actual fear that her aunt possessed a secret power that could stop her . Then she got mad , more at her own obedient reflex than any real fear . " It 's my baby . I 'll go where I have a mind to go . " She lumbered up from the table , inching away from her aunt , putting some safe distance between them . Bridget sat there , hands folded , lips pinched , neck strained . " Sit down , Katherine , " she said , nodding to the vacant chair . Nora remained standing , despite the fact that her knees felt unreliable . She did n't know why she was so afraid , but she was sweaty and sloppy with fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectedher aunt 's demon allies to spring out from the shadows . Bridget waited , then spoke , staring down at her hands , her voice low . " You 'd better be clear about this , Katherine . I am not going to permit it . " The words were driven home like nails , meant to hold . " I am not going to permit you to go to America in such a condition . If you want to endangeryour own life "  --  she opened her hands  --  " that 's your own business . " Then she shook her head tightly . " The child is another matter . " Nora shuddered . Where did Bridget get such confidence ? How could she be so certain of herself ? She almost could n't ask . " How can you stop me ? " Bridget did n't answer right away . She was turning something over in her mind . Deidre was frightened . " Oh , Mother of God , " she cried into her knuckles . " Be quiet , Dee Dee ! " snapped Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nora , unable to keep the trembleout of her voice , " I am going and that 's that . There 's nothing you can do to stop me . " She intended to sound strong , but it came out feeble . It had the high-pitched sound of a plea . She started to clear away the dishes , but she stopped and turned back to her aunt . " Are you worried about the crime ? Is that it ? Are you afraid I 'll get mugged and worse ? " Bridget did n't answer and Nora went on . " Because if that 's it , if that 's what concerns you , I can tell you it 's worse here in Dublin . There 's more danger on O'ConnellStreet than in Central Park . And up in the North , that 's a fine place to bear a child , with the bombs and the rubber bullets ! I 'll take my chances in New York City , thanks . " " You know , Katherine , I used to think you were a patriot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much gumption . I told myself that 's why you did what you did . But you 're not a patriot , are you ? You 're not a patriot , you 're not a Catholic , you do n't even believe in God . You do n't believe in much , do you ? You believe in running away when it gets a little fussy . What is it that you believe in ? " Nora was flabbergasted to be having this kind of conversation with Aunt Bridget . She had always assumed that her aunts were simply two more defeated victims of Irish civil strife . Sour , unhappy women blown by whateverill wind came their way . It never occurred to Nora that they might be partisans , active veterans with hard opinions of their own . It stunned her that they might be passionate soldiers in the war . " I believe in me , " said Nora meekly . " And I still believe in possibilities . " " Oh ! " said Bridget with a sharp , sarcastic voice . " Youp33believe in possibilities , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a little more than a possibility . I happen to know what you 've been up to these past years . I know that you run with the IRA provos and I know all about your brother . I know names , details , occasions . Bombings . Shootings . I know enough to have you both hanged , let alone kept in the country . " " I do not believe this . " " Believe it . " " You are threatening me . You are going to turn in-former . " " I am ! " " I do n't believe it , " said Nora , although she did believe it . " I 'll do what I have to do to save the child . " There it was , that old Catholic dogmatic reflex . Save the child . Kill the mother if you have to , but save the child . It was a brutal standoff . And then Deidre spoke , startlingboth Bridget and Nora . " You know , Katherine , dear , I think Bridget may have a good point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old placating gesture , an appeal to be allowed to mediatenow that the two sides had come smack against each other . She addressed Nora but faced Bridget . " We do n't have any people in America . You 'll be all alone . It will be hard at first , being a stranger , finding your way about . " She kept nodding at Bridget , who , by her silence , permitted the mediation . " Why not have the baby here , then get settled in America ? We could watch the baby , you see , while you get set up . Then you could send for the baby . It makes so much more sense this way , dear . " Deidre 's plan did make more sense than her own , but that was not why Nora agreed . Nora saw the flint inp34Bridget 's eyes and knew that she was trapped . Bridget could burn down the house with the fire in her eyes . Two months after Seamus was born , Nora went to America alone . She had no choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and gaudy and filthy and dangerous , but it was also somethingwonderful , something she had never before experienced : it was free . She felt as if she could open her mouth and breathe . It was as if she had been living on one lung until this blaze of color and noise . Even the life of a downtrodden barmaid was grand compared to the gloomy ordeal of Dublin or the tightrope of Belfast . And she felt certain that some undertow of fate had drawn her to America . She was bursting with it and wanted to show it to Seamus . She wanted his eyes opened before they were closed by IRA tunnel vision . She wanted her son to know the possibilities . But one day Michael showed up at her door in Americaand told her her duty . She tried to refuse , to defy him , to tell him that he had no power over her here in America . Michael listened without a word and let his silence erode her resolve . She had good arguments . She had a baby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was tired . She 'd resigned from the army . She was a dancer , not a soldier . But in the end she could not resist his terrible , silent insistence . He wore her down simply sitting there in his battered trench coat , with all the old battles showing up like wounds on his exhausted face . He let the face speak for him , and in the end he prevailed . She took the job at the Shebeen . When she considered it , she did n't understand whyp35she gave in . Partly , she knew , because she felt sorry for him , all alone in America , without proper support . Only his trench coat for protection . She could not admit the ember of sympathy for the cause . But beyond all that , the real reason she agreed to help him was the stark fact that she was afraid of Michael . And so she told him , okay , one more time . But it 's the last . I 'm out of it now . I have a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over , we 'll see , we 'll see . In life , she told herself later , you can not pick and choose . You accept . You make do . It was a consolation she heard on her mother 's dying knee . And so she sighed and performed her duty . She slipped the winter coat on over the apron . Martin watched her go , sitting in a dark corner with the others . He made no move to stop her , but then why should he ? This was why he asked her to work the tables , so she would be free to call Michael . There was some sleet in the rain , and her feet were cold and wet . Sneakers were no good in the rain , she told herself , like some equipment manager for a dance troupe . Sneakers retain water , but you ca n't always pick and choose , and she leaped over puddles as she danced past Cross Bay Boulevard , deaf to the traffic , lost in her art . She doubled back once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a soft drink and saw that no one was following her or watching her . If nothing else , she was well trained . Then she stepped into the phone booth in the rear , a booth she had never used before because she never used the same boothp36twice . She kept the door open enough to keep the light off and dialed the number she had memorized . It rang twice and then she hung up . She waited another thirty seconds exactly and dialed again . Someone picked it up in the middle of the first ring and said nothing . She counted to eight , making certain that the silence was deliberate , then said , " You 're wanted . " It was enough . She hung up and made her way back through the sleet and across the boulevard , a graceful dancer performing for an unseen audience.  |p37Michael  , as he called himself , lowered the telephone into its cradle like crystal . And then he simply sat there , very still . It was not that he misunderstood the message . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had something even more urgent to check out . His nerve . He was a man who had stood erect under fire , and before he could do anything else he had to know that his nerve was still unbroken . He had to know that the weapon was intact . He sat with his back to the apartment door waiting to die . They could come any time . And they would n't knock . Not even here in America , with its dead bolts of civil rights . They would come crashing in without warning . They would explode through windows and doors and even walls , if they had to . And he would n't hear them until it was too late because they would bep38professionals . Like himself . And because they would be professionals , like himself , they would come in shooting . He would be dead by the time he knew that they had come . Michael was not afraid of the professionals . He had grown accustomed to their long shadow . If he had any fear it was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone wrong . He did n't know what , but they would n't use the signal unless they were badly frightened . It was hard for him to assess the danger on foreign ground . It could be a real threat , or some weakkneeddolt frightened by a noise . Damned Americans ! A nation full of whiskey heroes . You did n't want that kind on a mission . You wanted solid men you could count on . Or nobody at all . He thought this , but he did n't give in to temper . He kept that in check . He was only prepared to turn it loose at the right time on the right target . He reminded himself that he was in a strange city and a strange country and at the mercy of an unreliable host . He hated being so dependent . There was a chance that they would all quit on him , now that something had gone wrong . That 's what happened with the bold talkers . They had a tendency to duck when the guns went off . Look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , on the other side , you could just winnow out that kind , send them on message runs or make them couriers . Find sturdy fellas for the real work . Here , he had to take what they gave him . And from the look of things , he was working with a lot of wet ammunition . The Americans just did n't grasp the gravity of the business . They were unbelievably flabby when it came to security . They could n't help it , he decided . Some innate urge to be celebrity freedom fighters . They allp39wanted recognition in their chosen field , no matter what field it was . And there was this strange quality of candorthat he supposed came from too much freedom . No fear of cops or government assassins . They had lost the tic of educated paranoia . The ignorance was apparent to Michael when they passed him around like a trophy . " I want you to meet Tim ; he 's very reliable . " He could n't seem to convince them that he preferred anonymity . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in secret . All their " reliable " Micks and Seans and Dans were so many booby traps ready to blow up in his face . And now they were exposing him again . He 'd have to come out into the open and see if there was something more than panic involved . He had no choice . The missionhad to be kept alive . That was the vital thing : the mission . Especially this mission . Everything else was tactical . He was worried about time . There was only so much time for a job . You had to get in , get it done and get out . That was the secret of staying alive . Timing . Be quick and be ruthless . He could hear the clock that had begun to tick from the moment he began the mission . The plane was a little more than five days off . Not much time to get the thing organized . Not much time to bring down an empire . He sat there and it calmed him . It strengthened a brittle anger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a boy in Belfast . He had walked calmly down the center of a street in the Bogside in the middle of a firefight . He was fourteen years old and ,  |p40according  to the adult gunmen of the Irish Republican Army , who shooed him away from their ranks on the grounds of his age , untested . Michael decided to make up his own test . There were the Brits on the one side of the street and IRA gunmen on the other , and Michael walked through the eye of the crossfire . Amazingly , when he came slowly down the center line , a sudden peace settled over the battleground . All the soldiers and all the gunmen fell into a dumbstruck truce at his display of raw courage . But it was n't so much a display of courage as it was a calculated thing . Michael guessed that the soldiers would be too confused to open fire . They would see him as a complete innocent ; it would be sinful to molest such a witless creature . Even if they read it another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aim would be thrown off by such a brazen target . They would be wild with opportunity . Michael understood the fine points of human nature . He also had the rare capacity to calculate and reason in the windstorm of battle . The thing that set him apart from most , however , was the absolute lack of limits . The average person could tolerate a certain amount of risk , a certain level of pain . But there was a finite point beyond which that person could not go . Enough pressure , enough danger , enough pain , and the mass would break . Michael had no limits . None . You had to kill him to win . Part of it was the fact that he was born poor and Irish Catholic under the Protestant boot ; this provided a naturalarsenal of resentment . But at bottom there was an inexplicable rage that even he did not completely understand . It was not connected to any injustice or any spe/cific grievance or cause . It was something innate : flaming rage . It was the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volatility on a short leash . He had spent most of his life acting as his own drill sergeant . The training and testing began before he could remember . When he was a boy  --  even younger than the reckless teenager who walked into a crossfire  --  he played a game with his friends . They would each buy an ice-cream cone and try not to be the first to take a lick . First one to taste the ice cream lost . It was a stupid game with no real point , except as a flexing of willpower . Usually , somebody gave up while there was still enough ice cream left to eat . But with Michael the game got out of control . One day he played with another boy of wild pride , and even after the other gave in and ate the meltingice cream , Michael held out . The game 's over , the others cried , eat the ice cream ! Not Michael . He was unwilling to stop . He waited until all the ice cream was gone , melted like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . The other boys did n't understand , except to recognize something freakish . No other child made war over ice cream . Michael sighed and rose from his chair . He shut the lights and peeked out the window . As far as he could see , there were a few people out on the street ; just normaltraffic . The opposing windows were open and showing light , not black with watchers . There were no clean , inappropriate vans parked along the street . No laundry trucks or television repair vans in the night . He looked up and down and saw no ambush . His car was parked two blocks away , in an open areap42that gave him a clear field of vision . Always an open spot where he could see an attack developing . He walked past it once , careful not to look back , checking the dirt marks near the doors to see if anyone had been scuffling with the lock , working on getting in . He checked the windows with a glance for fresh smudges . His hand was clenched around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the brim of his hat he scanned the streets like an early warning system . He noted the familiar signs , the undisturbed bushes . He marked out escape routes , always updating and improvinghis war plans . The ambush was n't there . Not this time . There would be a time when it would be , and there would come a time when he would probably miss it . A man eventually gets careless , drops his guard for an instant , grows tired or sloppy . Everyone . Even him . The enemy becomes creative or lucky . It would happen . There was nothing to do but keep going as long and as hard as you can . Change the routine , extend the odds  --  and wait for the professionals . He noticed someone looking out of a ground-floor window of a two-family house . His hackles went up , but it was only a man taking a contented look out upon his world . Probably after a big meal and putting the kids to bed . Michael could see the sleepy , unguarded satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snug and warm while the rain whipped outside . For a moment , Michael felt a jealous pang and wondered what it would be like to live on the other side of such a window . To have a house , a wife , children and a sleepy , unguarded view of the world . He wondered for one searing moment what it would be like to be not alone . But then he shook the thought away . He was not ap43civilian . He was a soldier . A soldier ! There was a war to be fought and he had his duty . He pulled himself together and marched back to his car . The second-floor meeting room of the Shebeen was where the Gaelic and Emerald Society cops and firemen held their monthly beer busts and parties . The walls were freckled with bits of Irish sentiment  --  long pipes and shamrocks and pictures of leprechauns out of Irish legends . On the plain pine walls were the modern travel posters advertising trips to Galway . But the soul of the Irish rebel was represented by angry historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named . Here was where the rebels took the Dublin Post Office in the Easter Rising of ' 16 . Here was where the cruel Black and Tans from Limerick were singled out and executed in the ' 20s . There were pictures of Collins and Pearse and Connolly , bathed and cleansed by time and distance . There was no sign of the modern Irish freedom fighter . The latest crop of rebels seemed tainted to the more conservative Irish-Americans . The latter-day IRA gunman carried the whiff of the terrorist . Considering the secret business conducted at the Shebeen , rebel sentiments seemed indiscreet , but it did thrill the tourists , and , in fact , the absence of the old heroes and epic poems in an Irish pub in the county of Queens would have been conspicuous . The dog had to bark , Martin declared when he hung them out in public . Now Martin sat with his back to the epic walls , watching the staircase , counting out his chances the way he doped out horses at the track , and making quick work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar . He had moved to the empty upstairs room afterp44Nora had returned from making her call . His hand trembled as he poured the whiskey . Christ , he thought , finishing his calculations along with a huge swallow of liquor , he 's going to murder me . Shoot me down like a dog in my own pub . I 've given him more than enough cause . And he 's that kind of a man . " He did say he 'd come ? " he asked Nora when she returned with a pitcher of ale to wash down the whiskey . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " she said in that thrifty voice , slamming down the pitcher like a gavel , hurrying away . " He 'll come , " said Martin out loud . He had a fleeting hope that maybe he would n't come , after all . Maybe he 'll vanish across the border into Canada . Or back to Ireland . You ca n't tell with such men . Well , this is what comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey and the ale , and it had no effect . He was dead sober and worried sick . Think , he told himself , but his mind was a blur . What would Michael do ? No telling . He knew from the moment he had laid eyes on him that he was one of those ice-cold killers who put bullets in people and never know a moment 's regret . All that watchful patience . Like he was hoarding up his temper . Oh , Martin , you do n't want to be around when the patience runs out . Having met him , having stared into the eyes , you had to believe the stories . They were n't the sunny tales of doomed patriots who wrote poetry on their way to a British gallows . Michael 's legend was one of powerful bombs and loveless courage . Operations meant to inspirefear , not poetry . Of all the deeds attributed to Michael , the most chill/ing was the Mountbatten slaughter . There were other bombs and shootouts and daring escapes  --  enough to make a man famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael had , or so the story went , swum out to Mountbatten 's yacht , where the beloved seventy-nine-year-old earl and his fourteenyear-oldgrandson and a fifteen-year-old passenger were on vacation , and blown the boat to bits , along with everyoneon it . The attack was technically brilliant , but it was also deemed heartless . The other facet of Michael 's myth was that he was impossible to capture . He had a phantom 's ability to slip through traps and elude pursuers . He had been actuallycaught only once . The Canadian police grabbed him when he attempted to cross the border into the United States . But he got away . He disappeared in the Paris airport when they were trying to take him back to London for trial . Michael went into a men 's room and did not come out again . There were no windows , no exits , no hidden doors . He simply vanished . This , then , was the man for whom Martin O'Shea waited with bad news . Concentrating on the staircase , Martin missed Michael'sentrance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Martin could n't tell if the sudden chill was from the wind or from Michael . He was a smaller man than Martin remembered . Smaller and less substantial . But then it was the legend and fear that fleshed out the character , thought Martin . " Well , well , " he said , scrambling to his feet , tipping over his chair . " Come in . Come in . It 's a bitter night . Warm yourself . I 've got a glass for you . " Michael closed the door and sat at Martin 's table . Hep46kept his hat and coat on , and Martin shuddered at the hooded image . The man looked poised for a getaway . The hands came out of the raincoat pocket and moved up to the table , and there was a flicker , a skipped heartbeat of apprehension , because Martin did n't know for certain what would be in those hands when they emerged from under the table . But they were empty , and Michael folded them gently , one over the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and that made them more menacing . " A drink , then ? " pressed Martin , pouring a glass for Michael , trying to drum up some geniality . " Could use one myself . " Michael did n't bother to reject the offer . He just sat there waiting , pushing Martin with his silence . Martin needed the courage ; he could n't help himself . " God bless , " he said , emptying his glass in a single toss , his eyes wet from the quick fire of the whiskey . His voice was hoarse with worry . " No sense beating around the bush , " he said , shaking his head , trying to smile , looking like he was already a corpse . " You called , " said Michael simply . Martin looked at him . It might have been a joke . But he saw no humor . Or none that he was in on . " I called . " Michael nodded . " I had no choice . " " Fine , " said Michael . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I here ? " Michael reached over , and the soft hand was iron as he stopped Martin 's shaky hand from going for the whiskey bottle again . " Michael , we needed the money . You know that.  |p47There  's the thing . We needed the money . For the opera-tion . " " I told you once , money is easy , " said Michael , hard . Martin could see that he would not get much mercy here . " I know . I know . Still , there 's the fact . You ca n't fish without a pole , now can you ? You need the pole to fish ... " Michael cut him off . He might have gone on like that forever . " What is it , man ? Tell me . " " Oh , Michael , we did a foolish thing , " said Martin , feeling the noose . " But I thought it was a piece of cake . The problem would be solved . " " Am I going to have to force it out of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you remember that ? " " I remember that I told you not to commit useless felonies when there 's important business on . " Martin shook his head and uttered a little cry of despair . " You did , I remember . Oh , stupid , stupid , stu-pid . " He reached for the whiskey bottle again , and Michael half tore his arm loose . Martin grew pale under Michael'sgrip . " Tell me , dammit . " " My arm ! " whined Martin . Michael released him . " Tell me , " he repeated . " I sent them in after the payroll , " Martin said quickly . Michael closed his eyes . " It looked such an easy thing . Beggin ' for it . A golden opportunity . Oh , Michael , I thought I 'd be helpin ' out . " Trust fools , thought Michael . Well , what 's done is done . It 's too late to stop them and they could use thep48money . Would n't have to go askin ' some other foolish patriot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oh , Christ , now he 'll kill me . " How much ? " " I do n't really know . " Michael 's eyes glazed . " No more dancing , Martin . Tell me straight , what 's happened ? " Martin swallowed . " There was a bit of trouble . " " What kind of trouble ? I 'm getting a little impatient with this . " " Some shooting . Somebody started shooting . " Michael 's first impulse was to run . To go into deep hiding . This is where the discipline came to bear . He fought off the impulse . He forced himself to remain underfire so that he could learn the full extent of the damage . He spoke very slowly , very clearly . " Who got shot ? " " Two of ours were killed . " " Two ? How many did you send in ? " " Four . " " What happened to the other two ? " " We do n't know . " Michael was very clinical  --  no sign of mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made  --  in the smoke and confusion of the long war  --  the grim computations of his trade . He could measure lives against effectiveness . How much would it cost to throw a little fear into Britain 's heart ? How much to clear them out of Northern Ireland altogether ? For that was what he was trying to purchase with this single mission . Two dead ? Not much when you put it in the macabre columns of history . The other side would pay even more dearly . Whatp49were a few Irish Republican Army soldiers against a prime minister ? And what was a prime minister against a united Ireland ? A bargain . Worth it . Even if it meant , as it surely would , that he would be run down by the professionals and killed without mercy . Well worth it . By that one act  --  the killing of the prime minister  --  the British Empire would know that they could never win . They would see then that there were men who would go on blowing them up forever . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad truce or a feeble compromise . Then they would bend the proud knee . Then they would make peace . And not until then . Michael ran his hand across his face . " The two who were killed , can they be traced ? " Martin shook his head . " Not for a while . They were imports . " " What about the other two ? " Martin took the opportunity to fill the glass again . " We 're hoping that they got away . Hiding with the payroll . " " Hoping ? You mean there 's a chance that they took the profit ? " " No . None . Not these two . One 's Matty O'Connor . Son of a cop . Good lad . The best . Would walk through fire . " " And what about the other ? " " Damian Boyle . " His eyes were moist with guilt . " Tim 's boy ? " Martin nodded . Michael remembered him . He was one of the lean and hungry types , brought over to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can trust him , " Martin hadp50said proudly at the time . Michael tried to explain : if this one knows , others will know ; he could n't count it an honor unless he boasted about meeting him . And then others and others and the secrecy was gone . They were so reckless and he could n't make them see . " Do the cops have them ? " asked Michael . " No . And even if they do , they 'd never talk . " " God , you blind , stupid fool ! In Belfast I 'd have you up against a pitted wall , you silly ass ! " " I 'd swear for them , Michael ... " " Do n't swear , for Christ 's sake . Save yourself for a mortal sin . " They sat for a moment . Martin lit a cigarette . " Well , " said Michael eventually , " I 'm not safe . " " That 's why I called . " Martin felt a stirring of hope . Relief . " Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael looked to see if he was serious . " No , " he said . " You and I are done . The cops will find you . The only question is how long it takes them . " Martin nodded . Michael 's right hand left the table and went into his coat pocket . He leaned back , making himself some room . Some killing space , thought Martin in a panic . Oh , God , here it comes . But it did n't . " I 'll make my own arrangements , " said Michael . " I may need some tactical support . But we wo n't meet again . I 'll contact you when I need you . Do n't try to reach me . " The head across the table bobbed : a great weight had been lifted from it . " Find out what you can . From whatever cops you know . I 'm sure you pal around with cops . But be careful . Do n't let on about me . Not a word . Do you hear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael . For you . I knew you needed some money to operate . " Michael turned his head . Just a bit . Enough to shut down that line of defense . This Martin was no different from the mob of them , he thought . Quick opinions . He 's afraid of me . He thinks I 'd kill him out of frustrationor temper . Michael thought , I could leave this silly country . Just get up from the table , get on a plane and vanish into one of the escape routes . It would be the sensible thing to do . But he had n't come to America to be prudent . He had an opportunity to unite Ireland . One stroke . Not many get that chance . He turned to Martin and said matter of factly , " If they catch them , they 'll talk . " Martin protested . " They wo n't . I would n't use such men . " Michael stood , his hand in his gun pocket , wrapped around the automatic , gazing down at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Martin did n't understand a thing . He was dangerously sentimental . Finally , Michael asked , " Good lads , you say ? " " The best . " Michael nodded . " Well , Martin , they say that you need good luck most when your luck is running bad . Let 's just hope that you got lucky tonight . Let 's pray that all the fine lads you sent out to the airport tonight were killed . " In the cold blast of air that accompanied Michael 's departure , Martin emptied the last of the whiskey . He did n't understand the high accounting of a professional.  |p52Jack  Mann hit the brakes and the oldBuick skidded in the rain and came to a stop at a tipsy angle . The man in the parking lot booth was waving and calling him back . I 'm caught , Jack thought with terror . What gave me away ? A trail of blood . An arm dangling from the trunk . I thought I closed it . I 'm sure of it . I tested it five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . The picture was vivid , right there on that clear screen of his guilty conscience . He rolled down the window and stuck his head out into the rain . He tried to show the man in the toll booth a smile , but it was closer to a grimace . The attendant was trying to tell him something , but Jack could n't make it out , what with the rain and the pumping of his own blood ringing in his ears . The at/tendant was pointing and yelling , and finally it began to come through . " Windshield wiper ! " " Huh ? " " Windshield wipers ! Your windshield wipers ! " Jack turned around dumbly and looked at the windshield wipers . He could not comprehend . The man sounded like he was saying windshield wipers . They were right there , on the windshield where they were supposed to be . What is he trying to tell me ? The attendant  --  getting wet now in his frustration  --  had partly come out of the booth and was rocking back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tock . " Your windshield wipers ! " he screamed . Jack had no doubt that he was screaming windshield wipers . The question was , Why ? There was nothing attached to the wipers . They were n't about to fall off . They were n't even moving ... . The dawning was painful . A slow extraction of a monumentally stupid truth . Jack 's windshield wipers were n't moving . In the middle of a rainstorm . He was driving blind . This is what the attendant was trying to tell him . He groaned . " Windshield wipers ! " yelled the attendant . " Right , " replied Jack . Not a great alibi , he thought . A little lame , but then the times called for something lame . Well , at least he was n't flat out caught . Not yet , at least . However , he had made himself conspicuous . He had planted himself prominently in the mind of the parking lot attendant as the asshole with the windshield wipers . This is what happens when you cross that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherit the many-sided worry of criminal paranoia . Now all I will think about will be the parking lot attendant and the windshield wipers . It 's the curse of the criminal class : small mistakes . ' Tomorrow , when the teams of detectives come around picking through the garbage for clues , they 'll stop to ask this attendant if he can remember anything unusual . Anything at all . No , not really . Just some asshole tried to drive home , forgot to turn on the windshield wipers . The detectives will exchange knowing looks and press the point because they are cops and cops understand that criminal lapses are just that stupid and just that ordinary . Criminals blunder over small details . It was an old cop 's wisdom : when you see someone who 's got the buttons wrong on his coat , chances are he 's panicked , chances are he 's paying attention to something else . Jack knew . He had been trained to look for the incriminatinglint , to spot the tricky errors in an otherwiseroutine picture . A police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for small disturbancesin the jungle routine . Windshield wipers not engaged in a rainstorm would be such a disturbance to a tracker . At first they would ask their questions casually , patiently , maybe even fatherly , putting the attendant off guard , at ease . Inviting his help . Pretty soon , the parkinglot guy thinks he 's got a badge and a pension at stake and starts talking perps and running makes . The clues would emerge and accumulate and , somewheredown the line , connect . Jack saw this inevitability as clearly as he saw thep55trunk flung open and the dead arm draped out of the car . He looked back at the toll collector squinting in the rain . " Tired , " he shouted , shrugging . " Had a bad day . " He rolled up his window and drove off . " Christ , " he muttered critically to himself , " you sound like a fucking junkie burglar ! " Jack heard the approaching blocking force of tactical units and could not keep his foot off the accelerator . He knew better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime . Walk . Always walk . Or drive slowly . Do not move at an alarming rate , thus attracting undue attention . You see someone running , you stop him . A primer lesson he had been taught as a rookie cop . A lot easier said than done . It may be smarter to go slow , but every adrenal instinct was to get away as quickly as possible . Fact is , Jack was running like a thief . When he heard his tires squeal on a tight turn , Jack realized that he was being idiotically conspicuous and let the big Buick slow down . The Grand Central Parkway glowed with traffic and lights . There were lights from the cars and the rain refractions . Lights from stanchions and from the airport . Jack felt as if he had been caught in a searchlight glare . For a moment , stunned by the flashing lights and quick traffic , Jack forgot his plan . But then as he made the turn heading east and slipped into the routine , impatientstream of late traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem : dump the body and the money as soon as possible . Leave no clues and get awayp56from both as quickly as possible . Forget the nightmare ever happened . Suddenly he saw the incoming police cruisers , cuttingthrough heavy traffic like expert skiers . They were arriving from both directions , making artful , twisting loops to form roadblocks at the airport exits . Jack was struck by the performance of the police drivers , putting those clumsy cars into controlled skids . And then a pang , a remembered exhilaration at the easy , confident skill . He knew how it felt to be behind the wheel of a police cruiser on a hot run . There was a wild , breathless sense of raw power . But something else . Something that gave him an edge over the bad guys . He felt a divine ' immunity . He would chase down alleys and over closed roads with a kind of daredevil belief that he was protected from harm by the virtue of his cause . He was the good guy . Not now . Not on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him , Jack was struck by the fact that he was driving in a cause that was not particularlyvirtuous . He did not like this other side . It made him feel vulnerable . He knew that he had to get off the exposed highway . Suppose he had a breakdown or got a flat ? He would be trapped with a dead body and a lot of unexplainedcash in his trunk . He left the Grand Central Parkway at the first exit . He drove into a side street and slowed the car and caught his breath . His heart was beating fast . He saw the ordinary houses and ordinary trees and was lost in the sudden silence . Getting off the main roads was like diving underwater  --  a slow , silent immersion in another dimension . He knew the street , and yet he was lost . His normalp57logical powers had been short-circuited by all the mentalturmoil . How could a man think on the run ? He inched along  --  it did n't occur to him to look for a street sign  --  trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Flushing . He might as well have been in Asia . He could see the suspicious homeownersdelicately peeling back shades and curtains , monitoring his slow progress . He knew this street . Although he could n't name it . But he knew it . This was where he had begun his police career twenty-three years earlier . He had been a rookie fresh out of training , and they had stuck him out in what was then considered the tame borough of Queens . He had patrolled this same block , answered the same calls from the same nervous homeowners . But it was as if he had landed upside down on the moon . He could n't quite get the orientation . Was Northern Boulevard to the right or to the left ? He put the Buick in gear and took a chance . He headed to his left and found NorthernBoulevard , the main street . The merchants did n't stand sentry duty on Northern Boulevard . He was safer in a crowd of traffic . He felt a little better , now that he knew where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police precinct on Union Street where he had once worked patrol . It was a risk . Cops knew him by sight . But he thought that he could make it to his destination without being recognized , for by now he had decided what to do with the dead boy in the trunk . He could n't just roll him out onto the street . Someone might see . Note down his license plate . It was cold and it was brutal , but he would dispose of the body the way mob hitters got rid of their bodies  --  in one of the city dumpsters . How did it come to this ? Jack wondered . His mindp58was a blaze of confusion . One step seemed to lead to another . How did it happen ? Is this the landslide of crime ? It all seemed so inevitable , so unavoidable . He made a turn and left the station house behind him . Ahead , glistening in the rain , was the empty parkinglot behind the shopping mall . It had the abandoned , bedraggled look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the timing right . Too late for the four-tomidnightshift to be on their meal break . Too early for the burglary stakeouts to be on station . He had the parking lot to himself . He cruised in and out of the shadows , checking for traps . Just for safety 's sake , he drove through again . It was deserted . The rain had even driven the homeless into shelters . The shops in front were closed and locked , except for the fast-food chains further along . But he did n't want a dumpster behind a fast-food chain . The hungry scavengers would be picking through them for scraps . He wanted a dumpster loaded with plastic bags and broken bottles . The kind that discouraged visitors . It nagged at him that he thought of such things . It stung his conscience that he thought so criminally clear . But he shook it off . He had to shake it off . Jack killed the lights and backed the Buick into a slot in a far , badly lit corner of the lot . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste from a discount drugstore . Might come up with some chemical contaminant . Jack was careful to leave enough room behind the Buick . He needed about a foot between the car and the dumpster . He made certain that the car was at the right angle to block the view of anyone passing by.  |p59Then  he took a deep breath and plunged ahead . This was his moment of maximum risk . It was slippery on the bumper , but Jack had to climb to the roof of the Buick and then pull himself up to the dumpster . He was careful , but there were few handles , and the muck made it ugly as well as slick . The top of the dumpster creaked and he looked around , but the sound was swallowed up in the rain . Good , the ' dumpsterwas almost full . He lowered himself again and slipped the last few feet , scraping his leg and tearing his slacks . It did n't hurt , but he knew that the excitement blocked the pain . Tomorrow it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not out of control . Then he stripped off his jacket and his shirt . He had to be careful about being conspicuous afterward . He knew that after he had done what he had to do he would be covered with blood and gore . His throat was dry and he ached for a solid belt of whiskey . Then he put the key in the lock of the trunk and opened it slowly . He knew what he would find , but there was always a small hope that maybe it was n't true , maybe it was a dream or a wicked fantasy . Maybe he 'd wake up still on the plane , still circling La Guardia Airport , sipping champagne . But it was real , and when he looked , he staggered away , hitting his head on the dumpster . " Oh , Christ . Oh , good Christ ! " he whimpered . It was n't death that frightened him . It was something far more shocking : the possibility of life . The man in the trunk had moved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and had half turned around inside the trunk . But then Jack caught himself and realized that he was inventing things . The man was definitely dead . He hadp60been dead in the airport . He had been dead all along . It was the rocking movements of the car that had rolled the body on its side . He told himself , do n't look . It 's done . The man is gone . You have nothing to feel bad about . He was trying to kill you . He got started . He bent his legs for leverage , then reached into the trunk and tried to lift the body . It was heavy and slimy with thickening blood and he had troublegetting a grip , but he kept at it , sliding his hands back underneath again and again . Finally he found some point of balance and managed to begin the lift . Dead weight , he said to himself . The body slid away again like a fish . There was no choice . It had to come out of the trunk . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , no one ' to call . He was on his own . He reached down again and got under the shoulders . They were growing stiff . He pulled the dead man out . Hard to believe that this was the same agile youth bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet in the airport less than an hour ago . Now he was like slippery cement . Jack tried to prop the corpse against the car , but there was no support in the joints . The body folded away . He lifted him again and held him steady with one hand while working for a better position . He was breathing heavily . This is where I get the heart attack , he told himself . This is where the vise grips my chest and they find us both here dead and try to figure out this fucking mystery ! He rested then  --  grunting and wheezing , unable to tell his own sweat from the slime and blood  --  managed to get the body over his shoulder . His knees began top61buckle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not now , you fucking knees ! Not when I fuckingneed you ! The blood and rain were blinding him , and he worked by the sense of touch . He closed the trunk and there was a moment of panic when he thought maybe he 'd locked the car keys in the trunk ; he fumbled around in his pockets , balancing the dead man on his shoulders , while he checked it out . The relief when he found the keys almost made him drop the body . Then he began the climb . Up onto the trunk . Slowly , so you do n't drop the bastard . Carefully , so you do n't slip . Make sure of the grip , like you 're on the icy lip of some crevice of the Matterhorn . Ah , God , God ! God ! He could feel the body sliding away again . The momentumwas irresistible . He felt like crying when the body slithered off under the Buick . He could hear the head crack against the pavement . It made him cringe . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Maybe it was worse . There was something profane about injuring a dead man . Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck ! He thought of stopping . Just giving up . He was innocent of wrongdoing . He could just accept the incriminatingaccusations , admit the moment of temptation , and get it all out in the open . But he could n't surrender a lifelong habit of rectitude . He could n't admit the foolish impulse that had brought him here in the first place . No . Despite the pain in his chest , Jack began again heaving and cursing and swearing in the cold rain . He summoned reserves of strength that he did n't know he had and began the maneuvering and lifting . First , up against the car.  |p62Then  , bending under the bulk like a fireman , letting his legs do the lifting . He was learning . He made no mistakes , working carefully , systematically . He got himself and the body up to the rim of the dumpster , at last using his head , to bull it that final inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that high perch with his burden in his arms , he looked up and found himself staring smack into the face of the dead man . " I 'll have nightmares from this , " he told the dead man . " If it 's any comfort , I 'll probably never sleep peacefully again . " As he tried to catch his breath , he tried to imagine how the sight of him and his dead body would strike the cops in a passing sector car . A station house legend would be born . " Then , then  --  you 're not gon na believe this  --  it turns out to be an ex-fucking cop trying to lose a stiff ! " Jack Mann might become a locker room immortal . Having recovered a little , Jack noticed that the lid of the dumpster was closed . Schmuck ! Why did n't you leave it open ? He turned to open it and twisted his back . I 'll feel that later , too , he told himself . Then he rolled the corpse into the hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the body sank into its grave . " God forgive me , " he mumbled . Then he reached over and piled debris over the dead man . He did n't want anyone peeking in and finding it . Tomorrow , with any luck , the corpse would be gone forever , trucked out to some Rockaway landfill along with all the other nameless mob victims buried in that unmarked cemetery . His work was finished , and he climbed down andp63stood on the asphalt . He was winded and wheezing . His muscles were singing from the exertion . He stood for a moment , dazed by what he had done . Then he fished out the car keys , opened the trunk and found a towel and wiped away the blood . He turned his face upward and blessed the rain . As he struggled back into his shirt and jacket , he looked at the bag full of money . The plan had been to toss the money and the gun into the dumpster along with the body . One convenient burial . It would be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe he should get rid of the money and the gun someplace else . He needed time . He stuffed the bag full of cash deeper into the trunk , covered it with his own debris , climbed into the driver 's seat and headed home . He was too tired . And it was n't only rain running down his cheeks . There were also tears.  |p64She  was cold and wet , although it was n't the winter weather that made her shiver waiting for the bus on the little spit of land between the airport and the mainland of Queens . It was much worse on an inclement night in Belfast . What Nora felt through her coat was the raw wind of Michael back in her life . This is America , she told herself . I do n't have to be stuck with my old sad story . When the bus finally pulled up to the shelter outside of the Shebeen on Cross Bay Boulevard , the faces of the other two passengers did n't help Nora 's morale . The first was a middle-aged woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rosary . She had the look of permanent fear stitched in her face and stared fiercely out of the window . A charwoman , thought Nora , from the look of her gnarled hands and wild hairp65and haggard face . You saw them like that in Ireland , Nora thought . Young hags , on their way to becoming old hags . Halfway up the aisle was a man in rough work clothes . He bobbed like a puppet with the movement of the bus . There were specks of vomit on his beard . Nora could guess his story . Out drinking after a day 's work and coming home surly and mean to his wife from high school and a batch of neglected kids . Then she saw herself in the reflection of the bus window , her wet hair flat against her head . We look like outpatients from an asylum , Nora thought , glancing at the pale laborer and the huddled charwoman . She listened to the hiss of the tires in the rain as the bus moved across Queens . The scenery made dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bus and witness the changes . The salt-sprayed houses of Broad Channel , with its pride of sagging docks , gave way to the haunted streets around the cemeteries of Richmond Hill . The crisp side streets were kept immaculate by the meticulous German immigrants who had settled there long ago , transformingthe area , with their Octoberfests , into a kind of Bavarianoutpost . And then Elmhurst , with its cluster of department stores , patrolled in the night by an army of private securityguards . On Queens Boulevard , the junkies clusteredin the fast-food parlors , waiting out their long ordeal . There , a few innocent transients , like Nora , made bus transfers . They adopted a kind of conspiracy of blindness . Each side denied the existence of the other . Late at night , the buses came in defensive bursts , arrivingtwo or three at a time . It was as though even thep66buses were lonely and traveled together for company , thought Nora . Most of the other girls who worked at the Shebeen lived in nearby Far Rockaway or Kew Garden Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worked late . But Nora did not drive , and she had deliberately picked the far commute to Astoria . It gave her privacy . She could sit in her solitude and watch the world go by . She could grow glazed and blank for an hour on the bus ride all across the borough . From the Irish ghetto through the German and Hispanicand black ghettoes , to her own Greek island of Astoria . She had crossed all of Europe and landed in the Mediterranean on a bus . In Astoria , unassimilated Armanians still bore an old grudge against the unassimilated Turks . In the AcropolisDiner , where she had breakfast , some of the waitressesspoke four dialects . You could almost believe the rumors that there were Magyar princes living in the rooming houses under the el . In Europe , thought Nora , the hatred would burn holes in the night . In America , the princes and peasants became only one more quirky faction . Nora Katherine Byrnes , from Ulster and Dublin , felt safe , tucked between the Cypriot Cleaners and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my child here . I could live here and in time become a resident . Go to parent meetings at the school . Grow indignantabout the garbage pickups . Support my local councilman . It was a staggering thought for a woman who not five years ago was living under false names and hiding weapons for IRA gunmen.  |p67Nora  was deep in the reverie as she approached the private house where she rented a second-floor apartment . She was jolted alert by something strange . The absence of light from her window . She always left a light on . It was a small bulb and new , so it could n't be burned out . By the time she turned the key in the lock , she knew that Michael was waiting for her in the dark . He was smoking . Sitting near the window , watching . She could n't see him , but she could feel the weight of him . He had watched her coming along the street and , knowing him , probably read her innocent thoughts about schools and elections and the dull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could so easily brush aside all of her defenses , all the locks and remote hideouts , and force his way into her room . She wanted to remain angry , but Michael had uncanny ways of breaking through her closed moods . " Do you remember Da ? " he asked as she slammed her closet door shut . He was still looking out of the window , checking , no doubt , to see if she had been followed . " Da ? " He nodded and did n't turn . " No , " she said briskly . " I never met the man . Listen , do you mind if I turn on a light ? I 'm not the nocturnal creature that you are . " " Wait just a bit , " he said , not taking his eyes off the street . His voice was soft ; it was the one he used to charm his way past all her outposts . Still , there was no mistaking the authority . She did n't turn on the light , but managed to feel her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's not here for tea . Michael does not make social calls . He 's after something again . But he 'll get nothing from me . He 's had my best as it is . Him , sitting in the corner like some cat with his coalblackeyes fixed like gunsights on the damned street . My street . The one I live on . She closed her eyes and could see again the thing that drove her out , the havoc from the bombs . The cops and the smoke and the limbs scattered like bloody pieces of dolls . But they were n't broken dolls , they were dead babies . The mothers bent over in a pain beyond grief . And here was Michael , still staring at her neighborhood . Damn your gunsight eyes , Michael . You can turn a common sidewalk into a battleground by just looking at it ! You would escape , of course , in the bloody confusion . Not that it was really her street that he was checking . She was a stranger here , too ; tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that secret , too , by bringing up her dead Da , reminding her that she had roots planted elsewhere . They both did . " I remember Da , " she said , striking the match and lighting the fire under the kettle . " What do you remember ? " he asked . She was fussing with the teacups and the sugar . " I remember his face , " she said . " I remember waking up once , and he was there . " Michael did n't move . But she knew that he was listening . She could tell by the depth of his silence how attentive he was . She was that tuned to him . " I was six , I think . I had n't seen him for a while . He 'd been away on his jobs and in prison . Mother kept a picture hidden away and I 'd look at it , so I 'd knowp69what he looked like . Then , one night , I woke up and there he was , smiling down at me like Christmas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael . " He was a scarce man , " replied Nora . She sighed . " Ah , little girls love their fathers . No matter how rare they are , we love our Da 's . I will tell you something funny : from that night on I never woke up without looking for him . " Michael turned away from the window and stared at the black patch where his sister stood . He rose from the chair and closed the blinds , then walked over to the wall and turned on the light ; Nora was struck by his competence , his ability to know where everything was . On his way back to his chair , Michael touched his sister 's shoulder . A light brush of his fingers , but Nora knew that it was a gesture of intimate understanding . He kept his vigil by the window , pushing the blind open enough to see the street . " The thing I remember about Da was his laugh , " he said . " The man had a great laugh . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , you could hear it a block away . Big , earthshakinglaugh . Surprised it did n't give him away on a job . " " Do you have a big laugh , Michael ? " she asked , and he turned sharply and shot her a look . She knew that he did n't laugh much . Smiled only on occasion , and then only when he could n't help himself . " There 's not much to laugh at these days , " he said finally . " Nor in his , I daresay , " replied Nora . He took the reproach , but he had something else on his mind . " He was not a careful man , " he said.  | " Well , in that regard , we might be grateful . " " I do n't mean that , although judging from history , it seems that you take after him . " She laughed . He smiled . " He used to wait up for me , " said Michael . " When I 'd be out with my friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window . Not Ma . She knew that I was n't worth waiting for . But Da had to see me safe inside . " He shook his head . " You know , he did n't want me to get mixed up in it . Not the troubles . Not the killin ' . " He shrugged . " He wanted me spared . Well , the man was n't cut out for the harshness ... " " Who is ? " said Nora . " Some are better at it than others , " he said . " Da saw that I was good at it . Too good . He told me as much . He said he thought I liked it . That was a dangerous thing . " " Well , " she said , trying to push away the sentiment  --  shedid n't need sentiment now . " A man wants his son in the family business . I 've always heard that . " " I was just thinkin ' , sitting here at the window . It put me in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . " The kettle spoke and she prepared the tea . " You 've done fine , Kate . But then , I knew you would . " " You did ? " " I told Bridget you would . " " You told Aunt Bridget ? " " I was asked . Being the senior male member of the family . " She shook her head . " And just when did you pass this judgment on to Aunt Bridget ? " He waved the question away . " You mean to say that you told Aunt Bridget I couldp71go to America ? Is that it ? You gave your permission ? " He smiled . " You really like a good fight , " he said . " All I meant to say was that Bridget asked for my opinionand I gave it . That 's that . " She slammed her cup down , breaking the saucer . " I want to be clear on this point , Michael . Was this opiniondelivered before or after we had that little party at the house , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America ? " He allowed the room temperature to cool down . " Look , you came to me for money . You needed the money to come to America . I agreed to give you the money . I do n't remember when I spoke to Bridget . But when I did speak to her , I told her that you would do fine and that she should support the idea . " He held his palms open , as if he had nothing to hide . But Nora knew that he had manipulated it all . He spoke to Bridget and prepared her for the outburst . He told her to hold the baby as a hostage  --  to see if she does well , would be the way he put it . He had given her money , he had smoothed things with Bridget , and now she had to repay the favor . The hidden chain of obligation was there . Not that she could prove it . Not that she had any more evidence than the knowledge of Michael . But that was enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I saw nothing wrong with saying a word on your behalf , " he said . She slumped in her chair , defeated , and drank her tea . " I 've seen Seamus , " he said finally . " Fine boy . " Nora sat upright . " You saw him ? When ? " " Week ago Sunday . Quick as a cat , he is . But he has a weakness for sweets , I think . "  | " That 's Dee Dee , " laughed Nora . " Talks a blue streak . We know where that comes from . " " Oh , Lord , " said Nora . " And nice . A really good-hearted child . He offered me one of his own cookies . If you know him , that means quite a bit . " " I know , " said Nora , although she did n't ; she had only the secondhand reports . " I told him he 'd be comin ' to see you soon . " Nora looked up . Her green eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ? " He sipped his tea . His face was like smoke , for all the solid truth you could find there . " I told Bridget , a child belongs with his mother . " " And what did she say ? " " She agreed . I 'll help with the finances , of course , " he said , peeking through the blinds again . " As soon as my work here is done . It wo n't be long . Less than a week . " So there it was . A bargain with the devil , but she was not prepared to argue . It had been more than three years , and she yearned to hold her child . She would do what he asked , if that meant she would get Seamus . They sat and drank their tea quietly , like members of the royal family contemplating genealogy , duty and the ceremonies of tea . Nora was afraid to take too deep a breath  --  it might erupt . After they were done , she offered to make up the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He was fine in the chair . He would be gone when she awoke . Too dangerous to stay the night . " I need you to do some things for me , " he said , and she nodded . She would not dare refuse now . He spoke and she made mental notes . He knew thatp73she would not forget the instructions . She was reliable when it came to such things . Michael kept a loaded pistol in his lap as he sat sentry at the window . He watched his sister prepare for bed and was moved strangely by the small , careful gestures of a woman of detail . The cups washed and dried and put away . The kettle emptied . The garbage covered . The teeth brushed . A hundred tiny habits that made her seem dear to Michael . The essence of attention . When she left a blanket out for him in case he got cold , he felt a stab of unwanted emotion . A man like myself should be alone in the world , he thought . Nora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , she understood the small killings , the revenge murders , the little lessons . But the large-scale political acts make her nervous . Michael had long since come to believe that the small killings were pointless . They might serve some local purpose , but as far as chasing the Brits out of Ireland , it could n't work . Gun down some beardless English soldieroutside of Falls Road and all you managed was a televised funeral with women weeping . It made the killersseem like monsters . The thing was , you had to convince that it was n't only the beardless kids who would die . No one was safe . Not Mountbatten . Not the prime minister . No one . People like Nora were shocked by acts on such a scale . Geopolitics was too abstract for her to grasp . But when you thought about it in a certain way , it was very creative . Michael had moments when he thought of himself as an artist . And artists were alwaysp74misunderstood . James Joyce had been driven from his own land by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tone down a harsh truth . But Joyce had changed the face of literature with a clear fact . Michael intended to change the map of Ireland . Besides , he had no choice . The prime minister was about to act on her own . In four days she would be coming to the United Nations to hold secret meetings with the Americans ; if it worked , she would deal a death blow to the IRA . The Sinn Fein intelligence networkhad learned that the British intended to make a deal to plug up once and for all American financing and gunrunning to the Irish Republican Army . And it could be done . If they were determined , the Americans could stop it cold . It would be easy to trace the money from the St. Patrick 's Day dinners and Northern Aid Committees . It would be easy to close up the ports of Boston and New York , where everyone knew that the Irish longshoremen turned a blind eye to the gunrunning . It would n't take much to impregnate the Gaelic fraternities with informers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed of cop , unpolluted by the old folklore and romantic myths . Without the Americans the IRA might as well close up shop . And the Americans would be given reason enough . In a world shifting away from the United States power policies , the British would support them in the Middle East . They would back them in Central America . England would be the loyal ally  --  in exchange for a crackdown . A pretty good bargain from the American standpoint . Somebody had to stop it . When the leaders of Sinn Fein had come to Michael , they had had no plan . They thought that the Americans could be influenced by ap75dull noise . A few soldiers killed here or there . After all , they pulled out of Beirut when a few hundred marines were killed . Maybe they could be pressured by some bloody demonstration to see the error of closing down the IRA . They left the means to Michael  --  the artist . And Michaelintended to do it in one cruel stroke.  |p76Jack  Mann carried around a picture of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcuffed , twisting to avoid the cameras , humiliated . Not that such a picture actually existed , exceptin that steamy swamp of guilt that every cop carriesin his conscience . But the image was so vivid that it might as well have been a tangible glossy print , mounted in his wallet , right next to the picture of Natalie . Wait a minute , he told himself as he cruised into Rosedale on the far lip of Queens , I have not done anything wrong . I have not committed a crime . I am innocent . Whatever I did , I did in self-defense . True , he had tampered with evidence and concealed a crime , which was , technically speaking , a criminal act ,  |p77but  there were mitigating circumstances . Any sensible district attorney , someone with a knowledge of how things work out on the street , would understand . The law could be merciful in the hands of humane people . The tricky part would be explaining the persistent bag of money . If he had no larcenous intent , someone might well ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk ? " At this point , Jack declared his right to remain silent to his own overheated conscience . He realized , during this frenzied passage of thoughts , that he was driving in circles mentally and physically . He had passed the camera shop and his dry cleaners , and it was the second time he had passed his own home . Well , there was a perfectly good reason for the sense of dislocation . This was after the airport . Before the airporthe could drive home while his brain remained on automatic pilot . But now was after the airport . The universehad changed . He turned into the driveway of the home that he and Natalie had begun buying more than two decades and three mortgages ago . It was not much of a house , even in the present bloated housing market  --  the shingles were threaded together and cockeyed , the siding was ragged and needed replacing , and the driveway had rippledand cracked like old skin . But Natalie loved it , as only a child of the tenements can love a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could walk in and out , making a complete circle of the house . She loved the staircase and the smooth banister curving up to yet more rooms . She loved the cool sweat of the basementand she loved the dusty storage area in the attic . She loved the cramped , scratchy backyard.  |p78But  most of all she loved the deep draughts of her own breath in her own home . When they first bought it , when they knew that they actually owned it , she had walked through the rooms with her arms flung out , declaringher territorial happiness . Jack was always surprised and pleased when he came home and found her chirping in the kitchen or sitting in the backyard , her face softened by a contentment that he could only witness , could only envy . To him the house was just a place . He had no sense of home or yearning for land . His home was Natalie . She was his shelter and contentment , not the fading wood and chipped cement . As he drove along Elm Street , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone was watching . There were always eyes on the street in Rosedale . This was the last stop in Queens , the last piece of land within the borders of the city proper . Thus , Rosedale became the grudging bedroom for cops and firemen who wanted to escape the urban terrors and yet were compelled by ordinance to live within the municipal borders . They preferred the far suburbs , but settled for this last-ditch compromise on the Nassau County border . Suspicion and disappointment came with every mortgage . Not that it was unusual . Paranoia was an occupationaldisease among the uniformed services . No one worried more intensely , more creatively or more promiscuouslythan a cop or a fireman . Jack loved being a cop , but he was never completely happy living among all that suffering . It was n't just the fretful backyard gossipabout the encroachment of blacks that bothered Jack , although the bigotry was hard to swallow . What bothered him was a kind of sour gloom that poisoned the atmosphere.  |p79One  consequence of living in Rosedale was that every car that passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched by a series of unofficial volunteer blockwatchers . As he had driven along , Jack could see the discreet ripple of curtains and blinds , as one after another of his neighbors checked , then recognized the old Buick as it made its way home . The garage door rolled down like a freight train . Nights when he worked late , Jack took perverse pleasure in the virtuous racket of closing the garage . Slammingdoors . Proclaiming himself in loud clumps of sound . But this night he was caked with dried blood and there was an incriminating bundle in the trunk of his car . He thought , I 've never come home ashamed . Fortunately , the basement had a private entrance . It also had a bed and a bathroom , complete with a shower . It had a desk and a personal computer and filing cabinets . It had an old black-and-white television set and a small refrigerator  --  both salvaged from the upstairs . Jack had turned the basement into a self-contained bunker during Natalie 's long illness . He had n't wanted to bother her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the basement during her long dying . But another reason was that he could not bear to watch , and so he held out in the basement bunker against the enemy he could not defeat . He stripped away his clothing , peeling away piece by piece the bloody shirt , the stiff trousers , the soggy shoes and sodden socks . They came off painfully , as if he were taking off a layer of skin , as if to remind himp80that he could not shed so easily what he had done . He worked in the dark because he was afraid to turn on a light , but the light from the street lamp outside was enough to make him cringe . One by one , he flung the articles of clothing into the furnace . He watched the fire for a moment and saw things in the flame . Then he shuddered and plunged into the shower . He scrubbed himself raw and thought of Lady Macbeth , a character he remembered from one of the plays to which Natalie had dragged him . He scraped under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back and even as he worked the soap over and over the same spot , he knew that he would never feel clean again . The furnace was still bright when he came out of the shower . He put the killing and the disposal of the body out of his mind , into some mental future file , and he went to work on the car . His own flesh was pink as Jack took the debris out of the trunk and cleaned it or burned it . He kept rinsing the sink and washing the car , knowing that forensic units would still be able to find something to link him to the airport and the killing no matter what he did . A speck . A hair . A broken fingernail . He had been a cop long enough to know that there was no such thing as a completely sanitized crime scene . No matter how many times you went over it , no matter how careful you were , something remained . The cleansing itself was enough to throw suspicion on him . But even though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how dogged and cunning cops could be when they sensed something , he continued cleaning , wearing nothing , growing slick with sweat . What would Natalie say ? he wondered . If she were still alive and came down here and found him in his birthday suit , working like a slave , what would shep81think , standing in that doorway by the stairs with that twisted grin of hers , that knowing look that invariably made him blurt out every secret ? " I only told you to wipe your feet before you come into the house , " she would say in that high sarcasm that he knew so well and missed so much . And she would know everything , because they operated on a plane of almost telepathic clarity . It was strange , that they should know each other so completely , considering the fact that he was a blunt , Irish Catholic cop and she a subtle Jewish schoolteacher . They had met on a blind date , and it was an awkwardevening at first . He took her to a pub , him feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not saying a word , looking out from those deep , intelligent eyes . He began to boast to some friends about his work  --  for her benefit , of course  --  hinting that he had played some vital role in a crucial case . He was lapping up the admiration and attention , and when he looked over to collect Natalie 's portion , there she was , beckoningwith her little finger . Funny , he had just met her , but already , on that very first night , he knew that gestureso well . When he bent down she whispered , " Applause , applause ! " At first he was insulted . But then , when he got his sense back , he was bowled over by the purity of her insight . With one swift kick in his brag , Natalie let Jack know that she had taken his measure . He could fool the others , but not her . She was on to him . Not that he was ignorant of the manipulation and uses of his own glib charm . He was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him popular in the bars and station house . Now he had found some/one who saw the plain vanity of his act and still **25;17091;TOOLONG in his ear so that he would n't be embarrassed in front of his cronies , yet still know that she saw something better in him . Natalie had hope for him . Later , when he took her home , they began to talk . It was strange , to let down the struts and guards and speak clearly . Even when they did n't agree , it was fine . Sometimes he saw her point . Sometimes she saw his . Even when they barely understood each other  --  him with his street-tough chip , her with her college-bred disdain of the rough ; working-class style , they were still fond of each other , still enthralled by the music that they heard in each other 's voice . And when they decided to marry  --  an inevitability that became clear to them at roughly the same early stage of the relationship  --  both families were horrified and predicted disaster . But Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody else in the family knew : they loved each other . They were compatiblein ways that few other couples ever are . They hated the same things : cheap sentiment , phony patriotism , Helen Hayes . While their friends were taken in by the obvious conceit of a movie like Rocky , Jack and Natalie merely exchanged groans and silently agreed that they had discovered another public schmuck . Togetherthey weathered the self-actualized , flabby human potential nonsense of the ' 70s and ' 80s . They had a warm contempt for Alan Aida and Phil Donahue , both of whom Natalie had described with laserlike accuracy as " repulsively sympathetic . " Not that they were a perfect couple . There were areas of their lives that remained closed to each other . She was baffled by the police work . From time to timep83she urged him to enter her uncle 's furniture business . She argued that he had a talent for work and they would make more money and he would be out of danger . He could not make her understand that he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner and a movie , they were walking back to the car . A junkie put a knife to Jack 's throat and demanded money . Jack acted on pure reflex . He grabbed the handle of the knife , ducked , whirled and kneed the junkie in the groin . The junkie dropped the knife and lay helpless on the ground . Jack stood over him and began to kick him in the ribs . It was very methodical . Very brutal . He aimed each kick to break a rib . The junkie pleaded , then wept and finally just groaned . It was Natalie 's scream that stopped him . " Look , " he explained , taking her to the car , trying to stop her trembling , " this guy 's a professional . If I take him to court , he 'll be back out on the street before I finish the paper-work . " Natalie was sobbing , trying to understand . " He 'll be sticking another knife in someone else 's throat in time for the late show . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who ca n't protect himself . Maybe the next guy 'll panic . You 'd be surprised how many slit throats we clean up in the morning . " " But the man 's sick , " said Natalie . " Exactly . He 's sick . He 's a junkie . He ca n't help himself . That means he has to do it . But my way , this way , what I do by breaking a few ribs is to put him out of business for a while . Put him in the hospital . Get him detoxed . Maybe give some helpless citizen a break . " " But , Jack . . . It 's wrong . "  |p84He  shook his head . " It 's not wrong . It 's true justice . " He could n't explain it any better . Still , Natalie did not understand , did not approve . It was a thing that lay unresolved between them . Jack stood naked in the garage , looking at the empty doorway leading into his basement sanctuary . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . He found himself , now and then , speaking to her . There were a lot of old habits he could n't break . When he tried to sleep in their old bed , he stayed on his side . A year is not enough time . Not after twenty . " What should I 've done ? " he said . " Ahhhh ! " He turned away and scrubbed down the car again , then showered once more and slipped on a pair of loose overalls . His legs ached and he felt his full forty-six years in every joint . Soon , he thought , I 'll be thick in the gut . That 's what happens when you get old . You thicken . Or shrivel . Well , it has to happen . Jack had always been one of those youthful men  --  someone who could shave ten years from his true age and be believed . Not that he ever did . He got too much of a kick out of telling the truth and seeing the surprise . " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there comes a time when even boyish men grow old . The age settles into their faces from one day to the next , like a snow that falls overnight and marks the start of winter . Age comes often on the downward slope of forty . Suddenly , there are lines that run deep in the face . He looked down at the overalls , no longer as loose as Iip85they had been when he bought them , and thought , I 'll never be thin again . And he was hungry . He began to watch an old Bogart movie on television and fell asleep before he could bring himself to go upstairs and make a sandwich.  |p86Was  it still possible ? Michael was up all night , staring into the dead eye of the empty street , and he still could n't decide whether or not to go on with the mission . The gun lay heavy in his lap . Nearby , his bag was packed and waiting . All the needed objects were within reach , ready , thoughtfully placed for a getaway . Such was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next room lay his sister , Nora . She should be out of it , he thought . He had seen something in her eyes last night . A desperate hopelessness . A shallow breathing and wild swing of the eyes , like someone looking for an exit . He 'd seen that expression before . It was the look of men just before they surrender . He should n't use her anymore , except that he had no choice . She was needed . But not quite reliable . Not the steady , fearless Nora he knew in Dublin or Belfast . Nora 's turn was another fac/tor to calculate . One more shaky factor in this dangerouslysloppy country . Was it still possible ? How could he answer such a question , with so many slippery factors ? Michael could sense the first light in the sky . He could n't see it yet , but it felt like a yawning stretch of the sky when he looked up . A gray November sky growing , not soft , but less dense . He could hear the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the scuffle of the early workers  --  crisp voices cutting open the day like a fresh apple . It was early and he could see nothing in the street . Nothing , that is , that would raise an alarm , which was all that registered . In her room , Nora heard the front door close . It was a gentle closing , not loud enough to detect , unless you had been lying awake all night like a held breath . Then she put her head down on the pillow and slept . Michael fell in with the early workers heading for the subway . Blue-collar types . Construction men and lowlevelclerks and telephone repairmen this time of the morning . Later , the trains would be crowded with the secretaries , with their imitation high-fashion style , looking like pampered models . Unless you looked close and saw that they were just a bit too short to be models and their faces were not the striking faces of models but the faces of ordinary women made dramatic by makeup and flair and effort . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men looked like lawyers and carried expensive cases , or cases that looked expensive . Always the look of things here deceived him . Everything was a knockoff . The clothing , the jewelry , the accessories , the people.  |p88Strivers  and jumpers . Made it hard on the cops , thought Michael . Could n't tell if you were bashing some file clerk or a corporate lawyer . That 's the trouble with this damned country : impossible to separate the real goods from the fake . Michael felt more comfortable with the heavy lifting crowd , the prols , who had no pretenses , or only the hearty self-delusion of all Americans . When he first arrived in New York City , Michael had taken some time to acquaint himself with the subways . It was a smart thing to do . He saw right away that the subways were the key to the terrain . They were what rivers and roads were to other towns . New Yorkers grew to understand them , appreciate their subtle effects . People lived off tributaries of the main lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own distinct meaning and cachet . Individual stations were populated with implications . If you lived at the 125th Street stop on the Upper West Side , you were likely to be poor and black . If your stop was Fifty-ninth Street on the East Side , you were white and had money . Some stations were clean and safe and some were like waterfront dives . And so Michael got the maps and rode the lines from one end to the other and studied the behavior and learned the basic protocol , which was that you traveled with an expression of massive indifference . Some riders even gave off an antibody of menace that kept them safe from the prowling hunters who stalked the underground . After a while he thought he had the lay of the land . He had an idea of the subways and their intricacies . But , of course , he had n't really penetrated the surface . Like some treacherous river with a calm surface and ap89demon undertow , the subway changed , shifted at unexpectedmoments and often had many meanings at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , but the complexity and the sudden danger of this system were always a surprise . The early-morning train from Astoria made its way toward Midtown , bodies whipping between the high handles and the footing like out-of-tune bowstrings , faces frozen in that permanent subway glare . It was n't too crowded now , and the beggars came through with their plastic cups . He listened to the steady whine of the beggars ' appeal , " Please help out a homeless man ! " " Just tryin ' to get a meal ! " " Spare some change , please , just some change ! " which fell on the hard-hearted commuters like one more stammer in the long , lurching ride . Nothing broke the commuter mask of concentration . They had heard it all . Blind beggars who could see . Crippled beggars who could sprint . Women beggars pushing empty carriages . The commuterswould get out of the way , but it was a rare coin that was tossed  --  like a basketball , for fear of contact  --  into the plastic cups . Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , notice the fresh team of ex-addicts who entered the car . There were three of them and they were young and had the shaved , institutional heads of psychotics . Their plea was for funds for a drug rehabilitationclinic , and they did n't just ask and move on . They were wild with menace . They were like targeted missiles , aiming for specific passengers . They put themselvesstraight in someone 's face and said pointedly that this was a good cause . There was no mistaking the hiddenblade of extortion . They smiled wantonly and ,  |p90since  they had a superior force , one by one their targets submitted . Michael blushed with shame and ignored them , turninglike an old subway pro into his newspaper , adopting the usual mode of isolation . He could not endanger the mission by exposing himself , taking on a gang of bullies . Still , he was tempted . It was a bad sign that he felt such an itch to turn them inside out . Loss of control and discipline . One youth with a shaved fuzz of red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a corner seat . He took the top of the old man 's paper and folded it down , and Michael made himself busy , searching his own paperfor news of the airport robbery . " Hey , mister , " said the red fuzz in his stiletto voice , " doncha wan na see us stay off hard drugs ? Doncha wan na see us stop muggin ' and rapin ' people ? " Michael saw that the red fuzz and his two friends had formed a semicircle around the old man . The other people on the train had spread out , giving them room to do their work . " Hey , old man , you don ' seem to be gettin ' the message . We are tryin ' to do the right thing . Know what I mean ? I could be out robbin ' and things . " The old man looked around . He could expect no help . Not here . People on this train had all declared a separate peace . The old man 's fate would tie them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it you want ? " asked the old man . The three youths laughed . " Money , " replied the red fuzz . " What else you got ? " The old man reached into his pocket and came up with a batch of singles . The red fuzz snatched it all away and it was more than the transit cop standing nearp91the door could bear . He 'd been watching it all from the corner of his eye with the haggard look of a man coming off duty , weighing duty against the bother . But the kids had gone too far , and the transit cop dropped his newspaper , revealing himself . " Give him back his money , " said the weary voice . Red fuzz shook his head . " He gave it to me , did n't you , mister ? " Red fuzz was glaring at the old man . The old man looked around for support . The two others were closing in , sealing off the cop from help . One was thin and had crazy eyes . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and itching for trouble , judging by his hungry look . Michael was standing across the car and he knew that the moment when they would strike was close . " Oh , Christ , " he muttered , then lurched , as if he had been thrown by the motion of the train . He planted a fist below the heart of the hefty youth . It was n't a killing blow , but it knocked the wind out of the kid , who dropped cold to the floor of the car . The thin one made a motion  --  as if he had a knife in his hand , and Michael reacted quickly , clipping him on the jaw with his left hand . It sent the youth sprawling across two screaming secretaries . Red fuzz began to run  --  or fight his way through the surf of a crowded subway car  --  toward the front . The transit cop was close behind , looking over his shoulder in awe at Michael , who retreated in the opposite direction , to the rear of the train . " Mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael kept his head low , but he noticed a couple of construction workers , roused from their torpor , taking charge of the two youths . I 'm a fool , Michael muttered to himself . A completep92lack of discipline . I do n't have the right to risk the mission . Not now . Not with four short days left and a busted plan . But this subway system is expensive . It costs a token and a piece of your soul . He could n't just stand there and tolerate it . The Double R line crossed into Manhattan from the Queensboro Bridge , and Michael huddled in the far rear , away from any commotion . There were little tears of rain on the window . Michael stared out of the grimy , smeared mess into the river . It was all a matter of timing . Could the train make it to the station in time for him to vanish into the Manhattan crowds ? Could he put together another plan and carry it out in four days ? Trust it to fate , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it does n't , there 's nothing you can do . Not to worry . The water was choppy and cold . It would be hard work and tricky , if he ever actually got to perform the mission . The waters around the city were unpredictable . There were fierce currents as the rivers emptiedinto the ocean . His stomach hurt , waiting for the train to deposit him safely . But , he thought , studying the wind whipping across the surface of the water , the mission was still possible . That is , if he could line up his support , keep his cover , minimize the damage from the idiots in Queens . If he did n't get nailed as a Good Samaritan . Still possible . Maybe . He did n't know . Suddenly the train hit the platform , he was in Manhattanand the tempo of life changed . The passengers poured out of the trains at Times Square like a flood . The daily melting of the borough ice caps fed the industrialthirst . Michael moved with the crowd . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain had stopped , but a strong wind was blowing . He could smell the sea in the air . It was too early for the call he had to make , and so he walked south until he found a coffee shop on the fringe of the garment district . From the outside it looked like a closet . A narrow storefront with a counter and just enough room to squeeze by . But the restaurant blossomedout in the back and became a big dining room with waitresses and booths . The garment center hotshots were already deep into their day , smoking thick cigars and making fat deals with buyers . Eggstainedplates marked the battlefields where manufacturersand buyers fought for their lives . In one booth , bent over a couple of fruit cup specials , were a pair of ready-to-wear models , miserable and exhaustedin the midst of their lifelong diet . They were not attractive , thought Michael , but then they were not on duty . At full attention , they might be different . Some people could do that with their faces through sheer effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tired and ached over their grapefruit and orange slices . Michael sat behind them and a gum-chewing waitress seemed annoyed when he said that he needed a menu . He read it then , while she stood there , tapping her foot . Finally , refusing to be rushed , he said that he would have a bagel and tea . He did n't much care for American coffee , nor for the tea , for that matter . But the bagels were a treat . " You want cheap knockoffs , go to Jeune Fille , " said the man at a table across the aisle . " You want quality , come to Max Gross . Max Gross knows something about quality . Still . After thirty-eight years . In 1988 . " He was not an old man , but there was something an/cient in Max Gross 's pitch . He sat back in his chair , having declared his high standards , having proclaimed his merchant creed , and blew cigar rings at the ceiling , as if that was where he lived  --  up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked worried . The two models behind Michael spoke in rough boroughaccents . " I told him . I said , you got ta move out . " " So ? Did he go ? " " Are you crazy ? " They went back to their sullen fruit cups . They all spoke as if they could not be overheard . New Yorkers lived their lives at full volume . There was a recklessness to them and their public declarations . Maybe that explained the airport . Maybe it was just anotherindiscretion . There was a phone in the back of the restaurant , and Michael waited until he had it to himself . Then he dialed an emergency number he kept in his head . The phone rang once and he hung up . He waited two minutesexactly , then redialed . He let it ring twice , then hung up again . He checked his watch . He had fifteen minutes until the next call . At 9:02 , he 'd have to call again . He motioned for the waitress and ordered a softboiledegg and another cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out another check , " she said in that slow , sullen tone of reproach . " Pretend I 'm a brand-new customer , " he replied , smiling . Meanwhile , Max Gross and his smoke rings had come down from the ceiling . The buyer was n't buying . He had thrown himself across the table and was taking an entirely different tack with his buyer.  | " Sam , listen , Sam . I ca n't meet that price . You ca n't ask such a thing . It 's cutting my own throat . It 's not real-istic . " Sam nodded . The tide of battle had turned , and he did n't look worried anymore . " I 'm sorry , Max . But , the way things are , I 'm gon na hafta look for a better price . I really feel bad . " The buyer started to get up , but Max reached over and held his sleeve . Sam looked down at the grip . " What 's the big rush ? " pleaded Max . " Listen , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing business with you for twenty years . All of a sudden , you 're just gon na get up and walk out . " " Do n't play games with me , Max . It 's a bad season for games . " Max let go of Sam 's sleeve . " Who 's playing games ? You think it 's a game ? I got ta make a living , not play games . " " It 's very simple , " explained Sam . " I ca n't use twenty-dollar tops . " " Who says I do n't have fifteen-dollar tops ? " Sam sat down . The models dabbed at their undisturbed lips . They pulled out makeup kits and went to work reestablishing lines that seemed perfect to the untrained eye . " You could move in with me , " said the second model , " but , frankly , things are n't so hot between me and Pablo right now . " " Are you nuts ? You think I 'm gon na move out and let that closet fag have my apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what my apartment is worth ? " They were counting out the money for the check in small denominations of silver . " Maybe you 'll work it out , " said the second model.  | " Maybe he 'll drop dead , " said the first . They left quarter tips and smiled their grudging smiles at the waitress and walked their professional model walk into the street . At 9:02 exactly , Michael dialed the number of the safe phone . He hung up after the first ring and redialed . He let it ring twice , then hung up again . He waited ninety seconds , dialed again , and when someone picked up the phone and did not speak for twenty seconds , Michael said , " I have a need . " He could hear the intake of air on the other end . He could always hear the catch of fear when the promises were called in . " What can I do ? " asked Thomas Flanagan , who was , publicly , the head of the longshoremen 's union in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tough-talking leader of a powerful group of rough men . But he had a private , more dangerous role . He provided logistical support for the soldiers of the Irish RepublicanArmy . He had been informed , through a cautious intermediary , that he might be called upon to provide more than the usual free pass for the crates of guns on their way to Belfast . He had been informed that he might have to do something to assist a man on a desperatemission . Whatever this man needs , he had been told , you provide . Do not ask questions . Do not hesitate . This is Michael , the lion of the cause . It was one thing to believe in a cause and proclaim your support , but it was quite another to receive a telephone call from a dangerous assassin . Michael , aware of his effect , tried to calm the man down . He spoke slowly , reassuringly . " Are you there ? "  | " I 'm here . " " Is there a problem ? " " No . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how fast he needed it . He could hear the suction on the other end . He had always counted on sheer boldness to quiet the qualms . " Do you think you can handle it ? " " Yes . Of course . It 's a tall order . But , yes , it 'll be done . " " Tom , listen to me . This is important . " " Yes ? " " Right away . You hear ? Not tomorrow . " " Do you mean today ? " " I do . " " My God , man . . . " " I know that it 's asking a lot , but there 's a lot at stake . Now there 's a good man . " " Today , " agreed the union leader , who was accustomed to making impossible demands , who spent his life negotiating them down , but who understood that with this one , what was on the table was what he wanted . Just then a man came up to the phone on the wall and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was using his presence as a pressure to force Michael off it . He would eavesdrop until this little jerk hung up . It was an old public phone tactic . " Just a moment , " said Michael to Flanagan . Then , to the man waiting to use the phone , " I 'll just be a min-ute . " The fellow just nodded . He did n't take the hint and move out of earshot . " This is a bit private , " said Michael , smiling at thep98man . The man folded his arms defiantly across his chest and stood his ground . One more minute , he thought , and I 'll just pick up this little runt and move him away . Just take over the phone myself . The man was big and brawny , and Michael instinctivelybegan to take his measure . Too much flab in the gut to be any good in a fight . But he could n't afford a fight . Not now . Michael bent over the receiver . " We have to meet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant on East Broadway in Chinatown . Be there at three o'clock , he told Michael . Eat something , then ask for the owner . Tell him you 're waiting for the man in the back room . " Fine , " said Michael , hanging up . The big man waitingby his side grinned triumphantly . Michael smiled back meekly . As the big man came abreast , brushing past to get to the phone , he pushed Michael against the wall . Michael suppressed the impulse to respond , and withdrew , his tail between his legs . He was beginning to get excited again . This thing was not going away . Michael just kept going , dropping his check and five dollars at the cashier . He made his way east , ducking in and out of buildings , making certain that he was n't being followed . And he chastised himself . " Good , " he muttered under his breath . The strain was showing . That could have been a big mess on the subway . If he had been stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops on the platform . But he 'd gotten away with it . And it felt good to put that big one on his ass . New Yorkers were a lot like the Irish . Get pushedp99around enough and you push back . Or develop an edge . A nasty temper . He kept on walking east , and as he walked the debate went on . Was it still possible ? He walked fast . That was one nice thing about Manhattan . You could walk fast without attracting attention . Everyone was on a mission . He passed the loading docks where the blacks and Puerto Ricans were leaning against their hand carts , taking deep draughts of the drugs that kept them enslaved . He passed the lumps of rags and some of them moved . The homeless men and women , hiding under their blankets of rags . He needed cover . He could n't be running around punching up bullies . New York was a perfect city for his plan . All you needed was money . A secret man with secret means could do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were so many rich desperados on the loose already . Only the poor outlaws stood out . The advantages to the city were dazzling . The subways , for one . They were dirty and dangerous , but they went everywhere . Better than renting a car and leaving traces . At Fortieth Street off Avenue of the Americas , just outside of the park behind the great public library , Michaeljumped into a cab . He could n't see the driver , who was blocked by the No Smoking signs plastered over the bulletproof partition . All he could see was the smoke from the driver 's cigarette . He shouted into the spread of ventilating holes , " Plaza Hotel . " Then he settled back and rested . He had decided . It was possible . The mission was on.  |p100He  awoke with a cold jolt of fear . It was that nervous quiver of feeling barefoot in a world full of broken glass . Not that vulnerability , or fear  --  or even broken glass  --  were unknown to Jack Mann . You could n't be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth somewhere along the line . Duringa small , neighborhood riot , bullets had flicked the pavement around him . He had been frightened , but he did n't lose his head . Some did . But he was relatively calm in the turmoil of a gun battle . Of course , it was one thing when he had the backup force around him . He had the security of brother officers . If he was hit , they would care for him . They would carry him to safety . They would protect him . But now he woke up all alone and in the basement of his own home , racked with the shiver of criminal guilt . He slipped on somep101underwear and his robe and tried to think , but his mind was a quick blur . He wanted to straighten the basement , but there was nothing to straighten up . He shut off the television and made up the couch . For a moment , he thought that he should be quiet  --  he should n't wake Natalie . But then he remembered that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the car , but he had cleaned it thoroughly . He would take it to a car wash , although he was n't certain what good that would do . The thing he had to do was to clean out the trunk . That 's where they would find all the clues . He opened the trunk , and there was the bag of money . Blood had settled into the mashed debris  --  the old papers and receiptsand fast-food cartons  --  and he took out handfuls and carried them into the garage and dumped them into the incinerator . Something would remain . It would n't all burn . They have ways of detecting , Jack thought . Modern science could re-create the destroyed evidence . Somewhere in the back of his most paranoid mind , he was convinced that they could find a way to replay a videotape of the whole airport incident . One rational part of his brain knew that it was a crazy idea , but that other place , the crevice where he kept his lost faith , was crowded and cobwebbed with irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done what I 've done and I have nothing to apologize for . If they could replay it , if they could see it , I would be deemed innocent . He was staringat the bag of money . The man was out to kill me and it was self-defense . He argued his case , alone between his garage and his incinerator , his arms filled with the bloody evidence , and he was his own worst prosecutor.  |p102He  had no more religious beliefs , had n't had them for as long as he could remember , and yet he said out loud , " Forgive me , Father . " Then he reached into the trunk of the car and took out the canvas bag of money . It was a bag . An inanimate object . He had n't murdered the bag . But when he looked , he saw the dried blood and experienced another shudder of revulsion . He held the bag in his outstretched hands . As if he could keep from contaminating himself . It was heavy , and soon he began to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , he had to admit , he wanted to count it . He had always wanted to count the money . Maybe that was why he did n't throw it away in the first place . Not to possess it . Not to steal it . But to evaluate his sin . To place it precisely . To count it . Then he would know just how bad to feel . He lugged it up out of the garage and through his basement lair and up into the dining room , where the table was big enough to handle it all . There was something  --  anote  --  on the table . Without a second thought , he took the scrap of paper off the table , thinking that he knew what it was , and dumped the big pile of money out of the bag . He spread it out , smoothed it so that it made one pitcher 's mound . He still held the scrap in one hand . A note from Natalie . He went to the window to close the shades . She was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people living together . What would he like for dinner ? Do n't forget the cleaner 's . How about this new movie that got such good reviews ? Call me at work , it makes the other girls jealous . I love you . As he was closing the shades , he suddenly remembered . He stopped in his tracks as the fingernails of memory raked goose bumps up his back . Natalie wasp103dead . He was always forgetting . It had been a year and still he forgot , as if the lapse in memory could alter the fact . He still woke up in the morning and rolled over and started to talk to her and there was no one there to answer . He still started to dial his home number , and then sank back with the knowledge that there was no one there at the other end . And now he held her note in his hand . Only it could n't be from Natalie . He looked down and read it . " Dear Uncle Jack : Large renovations and repairs to my hovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't mind . Barry . " He spun around , wide awake and blinking with the glare of the note . There was a sheet and blanket on the unmade couch . He looked up startled and undone , and there , in the kitchen , like some back room interrogation lamp , was the kitchen light . And in the full glare of the light he could see his nephew , Barry , watching him beyond the pile of cash on the dining room table , wavinga hero sandwich in one hand and a cold bottle of soda in the other . There was a huge grin on his face . " Ham and cheese , " said his nephew cheerfully , by way of explanation . Barry liked to talk about his food , list his menus , as if the talking itself were one more tasty bite . And he had a big appetite . He routinely breakfasted on fat hero sandwiches and spent the rest of the morning nipping at packaged cakes . He sucked in soft drinks all day . And yet , amazingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft flat tire permanently floating around his twenty-five-yearoldbelly , but , six feet tall , he remained at two hundred pounds  --  on the verge , but not quite pudgy . Not especiallyout of condition . The eating habits were , Jack wasp104convinced , a reflection of Barry 's essentially sweet , pleasant nature . Jack was grateful that it was food instead of drugs . Barry was always in need of consolation . Anna , Natalie 's sister , had died when her son , Barry , was still in high school . The father was a hopeless ne'er-do-well , seldom home . Jack and Natalie took Barry in , fed him , clothed him , but were never able to break through that high wall their nephew erected to keep out intruders . Barry had a jolly nature , but he also had a streak of mischief . He had been arrested more than a few times for car theft and petty drug deals before he was twenty . But even so , it always seemed so innocent , so devoid of true malice . Jack found in his nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of life as a small-time criminal , Barry managed to win his uncle 's sympathy . Jack had no idea how- Barry earned whatever money it took to rent a furnished room in Bayside , but he knew that it did n't involve heavy lifting or punching time cards . Barry was simply incapable of holding down a normal job . Whatever it was , he was also certainly involved in nothing sinister . Nevertheless , Jack had inherited certain obligations concerning his nephew . As she lay dying in that cold , mechanical hospital bed , Natalie made him promise that he would look after Barry . Even if he did n't like Barry himself ( and he did ) , he could deny her nothing under those circumstances . And so for the past year he had provided Barry with some cash , tolerated his eating binges whenever his nephew 's refrigerator was bare , and made a few strategic phone calls to old colleagues to bail Barry out of jams . But in the end , it was one winningingredient that enforced Natalie 's last wish . Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack andp105Natalie  --  when Natalie was still alive  --  Jack had always been cheered by his nephew 's jolly nature . " You 're gon na get fat , " he would say when Barry was chomping away at his second hamburger  --  and sufferingthe deep heartburn that frequently attended his own overeating . Jack would regret having said it , seeing his nephew bend over with pain , fearing that he had caused the chest pains . Barry took his breakfast plate and moved to the diningroom table , then pushed a channel through the cash . Jack seated himself across the canal . " I slept fine , " said Barry with a mischievous glimmer . Jack had no voice . He started to say something , but it got as far as his throat and stuck there . " You know , Uncle Jack , if you ever want to confide in me , if there 's ever anything about which you feel you want to unburden yourself ; in other words , Uncle Jack , let me volunteer my shoulder . I can be an oak upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't talk with food in your mouth . " Barry swallowed . Held up the sandwich . " Good ham . The cheese is a little old . " Jack ran his fingers through his hair . All the times he 'd sat across the table from his young nephew and delivered sharp lectures about rectitude and accountability ; all the mornings that ran into afternoons when he had explained with no hard proof of misbehavior other than Barry 's unchallenged sloth the need for strict standards and discipline ; it all came back to him now in his nephew 's sweet smile of satisfaction . " So , Barry , what 's new ? " Barry held up his sandwich . " Want one ? "  | " Do n't be smart , Barry . " They sat for a moment , staring at each other across the artificial surface of cash . " I suppose you expect some explanation , " began Jack . Barry waved away the suggestion . " Explanation ? For what ? " Jack turned away , looked at the window . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a spare fifty ? I 'm having a little problem with liquidity . " " No , " replied Jack , staring at the closed curtains . " I have no spare cash . None . I do n't even know what liquidityis . It sounds wet . " " I was just asking . " Jack turned back and saw his nephew staring at the bulging piles of cash . He pushed a wider channel between them . " Look , I am going to tell you about this , but I do not want it to go any further . Do you understand ? " Barry 's eyes widened , as if to say , how could you doubt my reliability ? Jack thought better : " Oh , I 'm not going to tell you shit . What am I , a moron ? Telling you is nothing but trouble . " " Fine . You mind if I use the phone , Uncle Jack ? " " Listen to me , you big lump , I am going to tell you a story and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not immediately recognize my precarious position , my peril , I will have you arrested for bringing this boodle into my house . " His arm swept over the table full of cash . " I think , Uncle , you underestimate me , " replied Barry in his News-of-the-World voice . " I have never seen a boodle in my entire life . " " Fine . " " Save this very substantial one on your table . "  |p107Jack  proceeded to tell his nephew about the incident at the airport . Barry sat quietly , not even breaking for snacks , while his uncle re-created the past twelve hours . Even Jack was enthralled . As for Barry , he had no troublebelieving every word . He knew that his uncle was incapable of lying . He did believe , however , that his uncle was perfectly capable of being naive . " But why did n't you just leave the guy there ? " asked Barry . " If I left him there , " explained Jack patiently , " the police would have routinely gone over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who might have remembered me . He would have a recordof my license plate because this was a car left in a long-term lot for a period of time . If that did n't turn me up , they would eventually get around to checking the incomingflights . I arrived on an incoming flight in the time frame . I arrived at the approximate hour of the killing . They would have backtracked , found me and God knows what-all . No , I had to take him with me . " Jack shook his head , in part to control the involuntary shiver of his body . " I had to take him with me . Removing him from the airport removed the connection . Now the police will not be looking for something that took place inside the parking lot . They will be looking for whoever this guy is . " Barry understood . He nodded . Then he asked a sensiblequestion . " Who do you think he is ? " Jack shrugged . " A stickup artist . A thief . A killer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Barry nodded at the door.  | " There 's a newspaper on the lawn . Want me to get it ? " Jack hesitated . " I do n't even know if I want to know . Oh , I suppose so . Go get it . " The front page lead story was on the upcoming visit to the United Nations of the British prime minister . Speculations and hints about far-reaching , historic agreements . Straws in the wind . There were wrap-in accounts of the massive security precautions . The lefthandside of the front page , the off-lead , was about the airport heist . It was carried as a purely criminal act , and the newspaper account was lurid . A shootout during a stickup of a payroll being transported through the airport . An armored car stopped by four desperate men , a wild gun battle and four dead . Two bandits and two armed guards . Another armed guard was badly wounded . Two of the bandits escaped . They were the ones with the payroll . " Listen to this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thieves escaped with more than eight million dollars . " Barry ran his hand lovingly over the mounds of money . " Eight million dollars ! " " Not even close , " said Jack . " That 's newspaper bullshit . You know , like dope with a street value of eight million dollars . In real money , that could be anything . " " Why do n't we count it , Uncle Jack ? " Jack looked at his nephew for a moment . When he spoke , it was with a weary , no-nonsense skepticism . " Putting all that money in your hands , Barry , would be like making you a hot dog vendor . Just too much naked temptation . " " Wrong , Uncle Jack . "  |p109Jack  looked up , surprised at the new note of sober responsibility that had taken up residence in his nephew 's voice . " You are mistaken . I understand completely , but you are wrong . We must take charge of this situation . Put it right . You have no business being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was no irony in Barry 's voice . He seemed sincere . He was being protective . " All right , " said Jack carefully . " We 'll count it . " They did it with methodical attention to detail . And Jack took a precaution : Barry worked the books while Jack lined up the bundles , stacked them , organized them into denominations and counted them . " It 's not that I do n't trust you to touch the money , " he told Barry , although that was exactly why he was the one with his fingers on the money . Barry nodded . He understood . He was content being this close . They worked quickly , as if there were a deadline . " That 's another pile of two hundred hundreds , " said Jack . " Right . " " How many 's that ? " " Sixty-eight . " " So , how much is that ? " " That 's one million three hundred and sixty thousand , " replied the nephew , looking up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds . " They began on the fifties . No use dwelling on the subtle meaning , the deeper possibilities of so much cash . " One hundred twenty-one stacks of fifties , " said Jack . " That 's one million two hundred and ten thousand dollars , " said Barry . " Eighty-nine stacks of twenties , " said Jack , growingp110grim , as if each increment were another nail in his coffin . " That makes three hundred and fifty-six thousand in twenties , " said a cheerful Barry . " For a grand total of two million nine hundred and twenty-six thousand dollars . Boy , do those newspapers lie . " They sat there as the morning dribbled away , staring at the big table , awed and silenced by the power of the raw piles of cash . So many thoughts raced through each . Barry looked at the table and saw vivid sports cars and buckets of champagne , naked women  --  and a long , expensive spree without those prickly stabs of worry about bills . Jack saw something different . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the parents would soon come looking . " Well , " said Jack with a sigh , " we really ca n't sit here all day . " " I could , " said a smiling Barry . Jack piled the money back into the bag  --  surprised that it almost all did n't fit into the three-foot-long container . Then he went down through the basement and into the garage , Barry close behind , and stuffed it back into the trunk of the car , under one of the spare tires , deep in the well . " I am going out , " said Jack . " Where ? " asked Barry . " I am going to put my ear to the ground and my nose to the grindstone . I am going to try to find out what gives with this "  --  and he indicated the car trunk . " I am also going to figure out some way of getting rid of it . " " Uncle Jack ! " Jack held up his hand . " Please , " he said staunchly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is not mine . It is notp111yours . It is a houseguest who must be returned home . Nothing but trouble . " " Oh , but Uncle Jack , some trouble is worth it . " " No . I promise you , Barry , this is only grief . " They drove off after lunch in the beat-up old Buick with vague and troubled destinations . Jack wanted to dump the money and then go to a car wash , but Barry talked him out of it . " You do n't want the money to get wet . It might run , " he said . " I 'll wash the car , " he promised . They passed the Queens detective command , and Jack saw the activity and recognized a major investigation . " God , they 've got units from the Bronx , Manhattan , Staten Island , Brooklyn . . . everywhere , " he said , notingthe various precinct numbers on the cars . He parked in an old municipal lot behind the precinct , where the cars were bent and smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not gon na leave it here ! " Jack looked around . " No place safer . " " Safe ? Are you nuts ? Look at the glass on the cement . They smash into everything . " Jack smiled . " Take a closer look , " he said . " They do n't hit cop cars . They never hit cop cars . " Barry looked and saw , among the rusted wrecks , the unmolested cars with the Police Benevolent Association stickers in the windshield  --  the same kind his uncle 's car had  --  giving them immunity from the car thieves in the area . They found the small diner on a side street . The windows were steamed and the traffic in and out was of/ficial  --  cops , detectives , insurance agents , City Hall hounds . Jack took a booth near the front . " What 's this ? " asked Barry . " It 's called lunch . " A woman came over , stopped and leaned down and took Jack 's face in her hands and kissed him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's too early to complain . Come back in an hour . " " This is my nephew ... " " Barry . I know all about you . " " This is Maggie . " " Charmed , " said Barry , rising out of his seat , taking her hand and kissing it . " The whole family , " giggled Maggie . " Couple of burgers , fries , Cokes , the works , " said Jack . " Medium rare . Mo ? " " He 's in the back . " Maggie came back trailing a big , bearded man with a huge belly . She was smiling as if she had personally cooked this dish . " Tuna on rye , hold the mayo , little lettuce , right ? " Mo nodded . As Mo moved into the booth like some oversized liner berthing in a tight pier , Jack introduced him . " Tuna on rye , I 'd like you to meet my nephew : burger , medium rare . " " Very tasty , " said Barry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barry saw that this one was a cop , too . Uncanny how you could spot them . What was it ? A certain subdued arrogance ? No need to think it was the gun . That explosivepower riding along the hip . But it was something else . Some indefinable psychic swagger that made it possible for them to intimidate  --  because that wasp113what they did : intimidate . Some inner ear listening for trouble . Mo was a born cop . He lived on the top floor of an apartment house where he spent his nights listening for footsteps on the roof . While his wife slept beside him , Mo learned to tell the difference in the tread of a tenant and a burglar . A Jew , Mo married the daughter of a cop  --  a Catholic woman who counted Mo 's policeman'snature as superior to their religious differences . She would wake up in the morning and look over at his puffy face and know that he 'd been up all night standing sentry . Jack and Mo ate their lunch , tossing around old storieswhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys who grabbed my purse are young kids , Officer , how 're you gon na catch them ? " said Mo . " She said it to the wrong guy , " interjected Jack . " Well , they had a block on me and they 're running easy . Like , Who is this cream puff on our tails ? " Jack and Barry laughed , although Barry did n't know why . He merely sensed that there was an insider 's secret . " I go into hyperspeed , " said Mo . " I am moving . I catch up to the first and he sees me and he almost faints . I cuff him , and I tell him to keep up because we have to catch his partner . " " Did he keep up ? " " For a while . But he got winded and collapsed . There was a precinct unit trailing us , and they picked him up . So , six blocks later , I catch up to the leader , who is huffing and puffing  --  really sucking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " This guy is fast , " Jack said to Barry . " You would not believe it . "  | " He tosses the purse back at me and I scoop it up and keep going after him . " Maggie brought the coffee and there was a pause while they sugared and creamed it . " So , " asked Jack , when she had gone , " did you get him ? " Mo laughed . Lit another cigarette . " Not exactly . Some highway unit sees me running in the street with a lady 's handbag and pulls me over , throws me up against the wall and tosses me . By the time they find my shield , this rabbit is gone . " Jack almost fell off his seat at that . Barry smiled and thought , Cops ! " Uh , listen , Barry , could you go check on the car ? " Barry was startled . " Sure , Uncle Jack . " When they were alone , Jack asked his old partner how it felt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , Jack . It ai n't that bad . Listen , I 'm not a kid anymore . " " You 're not fifty . " They drank coffee . " After I chased down those two guys ? I was out of lungs . None . Was a time I could run all week . Fat as I am . Listen , you start to get old . Remember what DorothyParker said . " " Mo , they never let me join the Round Table . " " After forty , it 's patch , patch , patch . " Jack nodded . Then he felt an old comfort  --  the safe warmth of his onetime partner . " Listen , pal , I 'm trying to pick up something on this airport heist . " " Stay away , " replied Mo , taking a last large mouthfulp115of sandwich , stuffing a piece of pickle in the side . " What , you got a client ? " " Maybe . I know there 's a lot of heat and I know that there are markers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Mo . " No telling what the next layer 's gon na be . " " Give me a hint . " Mo looked around , bent across the table . " It 's no big secret , but you know that this was a protected payroll . " If Mo had been paying more attention he would have seen his old partner grow pale . He would have detected the unsteady quiver in Jack 's voice . But he was rolling along , giving up known gossip . " Protected ? " asked Jack . Mo nodded . " The boys in Atlantic City were washingthe hands of the boys in Las Vegas . You know how it works . Payrolls moving in cash under mob control . " Jack sat back and rubbed his neck . " Whoever got this payroll is in for major grief . " " No shit , " said Jack sarcastically . " But they 're puttingup a fifty-thousand-dollar reward . " " Yeah , that 's Sally Bones . You remember him . One of their own posing as a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey ! Ai n't anybody getting a hot divorce ? I 'd think business would be good . " " No . AIDS makes everyone faithful . Tough times for keyhole peeping . " " Yeah , well , stay away from this one . This could be really tough times . " Jack and Barry drove home silently . A few words about staying inside . Not attracting attention . " But I have to go out , " said Jack.  |p116Barry  nodded obediently . " I 'm not leaving you any money . It 'll keep you barefootand pregnant . " " Where would I go ? " asked Barry innocently . Barry waited until his uncle was gone , then fished out the stacks of bills he had hidden under the cushions of the couch during the counting . He had four stacks of hundreds , six stacks of fifties and one stack of twenties  --  givinghim a grand total of $144,000 . He was fingering the bills as he dialed the number of the chop shop . He waited . " Dino ? It 's Barry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make it right . Trust me . Listen , you still got that Ferrari ? I know , I know . Cash on the barrel head . I 'll be down . Late this afternoon . I got healthy in a card game . " As he boarded a bus , he realized that he did n't have the exact fare . The driver kept the door open in order to throw him out . Finally , Barry gave up . " Keep the change , " he said , tossing the flabbergasted driver a fifty.  |p117The  floor manager in the men 's departmentat Saks Fifth Avenue had been alerted to a disturbance by that inner-store telegraph of arched eyebrows , a tone of alarmed contempt , and the flustered attention of a swarm of sales personnel surrounding the suspect customer in the overpriced suit department . " How may I help you , sir ? " asked the floor manager , an unctuous , bottle-shaped fop who had adopted the retailstage name of Mr. Hilary . Michael continued to examine the texture of a herringbone , then , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you know . " Mr. Hilary  --  recognizing at once the sound of raw authority  --  scattered the overheated sales force : " Mr. Coleman , I believe that there is a problem in colorp118matching in Ready-to-Wear . Mr. Marlowe , now is a good time to attend to the chaos in Outerwear . " No one replied . No one objected . They all bobbed and went off to their new assignments , understanding that the crisis was past . Or at least under control . Michael enjoyed the stir , although it violated one of the rules of cover : not to call attention to oneself . He appreciated the confusion caused by his almost undetectableinsistence . For though he was small in stature , and not impressive at a distance , Michael was commanding up close . He could shrivel a snotty clerk with the snap of his finger , which is how he handled Mr. Hilary . " Yes , sir ? " asked Mr. Hilary , moving in behind Michael , reacting to the snap of the finger . " I 'll want a tailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my measurements . " " Of course . " " I 'll want several suits , a new topcoat , some other items . I 'll want them altered and delivered to the Plaza today . " " Uh , alterations could take some time , " said Mr. Hilary , bending down to pick up a lost petal from the carnationin his lapel . Michael turned , handed him the herringbone , along with a plain brown suit , a deep blue suit , a sports jacket and several pairs of slacks . " You 'll see to it , " he said , smiling frostily . " Uh , weeelll ... " " My name is Michael Martin . I trust you 'll take care of things for me , as I 'm rather pressed . " Michael turned away . " Go fetch the tailor , " he said . He always found it best to act like British aristocracy and take charge when they 're flustered.  |p119The  tailor , summoned hurriedly , went grumbling over the surfaces of Michael 's body as the floor manager attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael , who accepted the grudging attention without complaint or gratitude . " How do you like the cuffs ? " asked the tailor in a tone of pure complaint . " I do n't , " said Michael . " The trousers will break at the shoe line . I would like some linen to show on the jacket . Not much . Just enough to display linen . " The tailor grumbled on , but now with some respect , for he liked a customer with definite opinions about cut and style . He hated the crude American rich men who had opinions without taste . This one knew what he wanted and made it plain , without the sniveling indecisionthat made him curse and stab his own fingers with anger and frustration . Michael also ordered some luggage , shoes , underwear , socks , and settled the account with a charge card . Mr. Hilary put it through personally . Michael had checked in to the Plaza as Michael Martin  --  a name unknown to anyone except himself and a man in France who supplied a credit card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sales force at Saks . " I will be out for the afternoon and there will be some things delivered from Saks , " he told the nodding clerk at the front desk . " Send them to my room . " He handed the clerk a fifty-dollar bill . " Have them hung up and put away . " It was n't hard finding the restaurant on East Broadway . Michael was familiar with Chinatown . It was twothirtywhen he arrived  --  he always arrived early so that he could see an ambush developing . The host seatedp120him . Since he was hungry , Michael ordered soup and a dish of spicy chicken . The restaurant was empty except for a pair of lovers lingering over a late lunch . Could be , thought Michael , watching until he saw that they were too young and too soft and too besotted with each other to be a threat . The men he expected arrived , looked around , focused on him carefully , blatantly , then dismissed Michael as one more obvious tourist and headed for an upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They saw what they expected to see . Not the owner of the restaurant . He sat by the cash register and never took his eyes off Michael . He knew the look of hunger that had nothing to do with food . Probably had to deal with rapacious warlords back in the old country , thought Michael . Two bodyguards took up positions near the door . They had a strategic view of the staircase and of the street . Halfway through his meal , Michael summoned the manager . " Mr. Flanagan is expecting me , " he said . " You are , name please ? " asked the owner , playing his part , looking for the signal . " I am a stranger , " replied Michael . He walked up the stairs slowly , to make them think , to give them time . He was like someone on the bridge of a ship at night , getting accustomed to the dark . By the time he reached the top of the stairs , Flanagan was standing up , waiting , smiling , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , taking it in . There was Flanagan , stepping forward , the leader , flanked by a pair of rough goons . He 's flexing some muscle ,  |p121thought  Michael . He wants to show me that he 's not to be taken lightly . " Could we talk alone . " It was not a question and Tom Flanagan was no cream puff . " Wait downstairs , boys , " he said with the gruff certainty of a man who understood gesture . Flanagan remained standing . He was taller , and the advantage was little enough . He shook hands and Michaelwas quiet , accepting the ritual , the small assertion , then sat at the table . " Well , sir , I see that you found us . " " You gave good directions . " Flanagan leaned closer . " Terrible thing , last night . I 'm glad to see you 're all in one piece . " " I had nothing to do with it , " said Michael , shrugging . Then he added , " However , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves a purpose , " he said with chilling aplomb . " It makes the other fellow less confident . You see , it throws off his calculations . He ca n't tell precisely where you 'll draw the line . " Flanagan laughed and shook his head . " Yes , I can see that . " Then , soberly , " But , Michael , this is different . " " How 's this different , Mr. Flanagan ? " " This is Mafia . The payroll at the airport belonged to a crime family . They guard that with the same fierce protective eye as they guard their women 's chastity . " Michael considered this . He turned the news around a few times , but did n't let it disturb the hard face of determination he had worn to the meeting . " Well , all right , it 's the Mafia ; how does that make it different ? " Flanagan blew out some air . " How ? My God , man ,  |p122we  're talking about organized crime . That 's like killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge . The Mafia thrives on it . They welcome a chance to show off . " " Well , " said Michael evenly , " they 're going to have to eat this one . " " Michael , I do n't think you appreciate our position . Those guys  --  the Mafia  --  they 're like nations . They think that they ca n't afford to lose face . They go a little nuts when you make them look bad . And walking off with one of their payrolls makes them look very bad . " Michael thought about this . He lit a cigar . " I do n't mean to be rude , Mr. Flanagan , but I think that they 're in more trouble than I am . I mean , I do n't care about their pride . I really do n't . " Flanagan was wringing his hands . " When they find out what happened  --  God forbid  --  they 're going to come after you , " he said . " They 're going to try to make an example of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be a feather for them . Make them look strong . They 'll pull out all stops . " " And what if I started pulling out the stops ? How many do you think I could reach before I had to quit ? " Flanagan laughed nervously . As if Michael were joking , which they both knew that he was not . " Let me make it clear , " said Michael , leaning across the table . " I do n't really give a fuck for the British Empireand I do n't give a fuck for the Sicilian empire . " Then he leaned back and puffed on his cigar . " It 's not something we have to worry about now . They do n't know me . There 's no need for them to find out . And if they do . . . " He shrugged . Flanagan looked confused . He thought , The man does n't understand what 's going on or else he 's so farp123gone that he does n't give a damn about living . Either way , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your mission is . I know that you 're in a hurry . But I 'm better off in the dark . I understand that . I know it 's important or you would n't be here . I 'm prepared to lend all support . All support . But let me just say something . " " If you 're going to give me another scary lecture , save your breath . Tom , I 'm here to do what I have to do . I 'm here to die , if need be . Takin ' a couple of nasty Italian fuckers with me wo n't bother me a bit . Not a bit . I wo n't die cheap . " He shrugged . " If you 're with me , that 's fine . If not , good luck . But I 'm going to do what I have come to do . " They took sips from the tea on the table . Michael sucked his fat cigar . He liked a cigar now and then . Gave a man something solid to hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the support ? " Flanagan always considered himself tough , having come up on the docks when fights took place with iron hooks and blood ran thick in the bars along the quay . But this one was some other breed . This one would n't flinch . This one was one of those wild , **30;17118;TOOLONG lovers  --  the kind that would n't lose a fight . The kind you had to kill to defeat . Flanagan was tough , but he had his limits and he was outclassed by Michael and he knew it . He 'd seen that kind before , and they always frightened him with their suicidal courage . Flanagan nodded . " Whatever you need , Michael . " " Fine , " said Michael , giving him the instructions , accepting the envelope with credit cards and cash and a checkbook in the name of Vincent O'Dell . " If you need more , there 's more , " said Flanagan.  | " There 's a safe-deposit box . The key is in the envelope . There 's more cash in there . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars to operate with . " " And what about the logistics ? " asked Michael , puttingthe items away in various pockets . " Well , we can get what you asked for . It 'll take a few days . " " I do n't have much time . " Flanagan nodded vigorously . " I understand . But it 's not easy to get one of those launchers , let alone three . " " But you can do it . " " I can do it . " " And the two lads ? " " It 's in the pipeline . They 'll be here tomorrow . " " All right . I 'll tell you where to have them meet me . " Afterward Michael rode an uptown bus through Manhattan . He preferred the buses . There was somethingpeaceful and safe about the big , lumbering things , moving soothingly through rough traffic , comically bumbling up and down gently , with everyone loaded down with bundles , grateful for a seat . The subways were more jangling . They got you there quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urine . The cabs were less risky , but they exposed you to a driver , and some of them were like airport X-ray machines , alwaysstudying the man in the back , trying to read him . The buses were better . He walked across Fifty-seventh Street , stopping for a coffee , watching for a tail . That was the other advantage of the bus . Hard to plant a tail on a bus . After the coffee , he jumped into a cab and rode across the park and up to the Museum of Natural History.  |p125He  walked through the museum , doubled back out onto Amsterdam Avenue , where he bought a cap , then caught another bus downtown . The habits of caution were ingrained and deep . He studied the faces he passed on the street without seeming to look . He looked in the store windows to see who was behind him . He paused in stores and surveyed the street . He ducked in and out of garages  --  looking like one more confused tourist  --  but all the while he was establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all his stealth and caution , he had that feeling that he was being watched . That someone was on to his trail that he could n't shake . It was n't the first time that he had had such a feeling . Sometimes it was a true premonition . Sometimes it was the alarm set too tight . Nevertheless , it was something that he could not ignore . He stood in the Plaza lobby for a moment , pretending to study the dinner menu , glancing over some guided tours , giving whatever was making his neck hairs stand time to catch up . Then he asked the bellman if his packages had come from Saks , and the bellman said that he had personally unpacked them . Michael took the elevator to a floor that was not his , and walked up three flights of stairs . He walked as softly as a whisperand listened for the inappropriate silences . In his room , he stripped and soaked in a hot tub , making certain to set the mirrors so that he had a view of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock and by the door so that anyone trying to slip in would make some noise . He lay down and took one of his naps , with his gun under the pillow and his ears still alert . He dreamed the same old dream . They were comingp126up behind him , and when he turned there was no one there . They were ahead of him , and when he rushed to catch up the street was empty . The city was empty . The world was empty . He was all alone in the world . It did n't take much psychological insight for him to understand the meaning of his dream . Ah , it 's just a conscience , he told himself , as if that were a useless appendage like a tonsil that he should have had removed years ago . He slept for an hour , then awoke with that cold sweat of dislocation . He looked at his watch and he looked out of the window . It was dark . He glanced around the room . The things he had inventoried were in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed the little traps around the room to see if he would have visitors when he was gone  --  a thin dab of powder near the suitcase ; a certain twist on the cap of the toothpaste . Then he left . The brisk air cleared his head . Time to relax , he told himself , as if relaxation were one more inevitable body function that had to be attended to . There was a bar uptown . Not the hottest spot in town  --  he could get in trouble at the hottest spot . But hot enough . A room filled with anxious clerks and junior executives . Hungry , upscale strivers who would judge any book by its cover . " Name 's Vincent , " he told a young somebody at the bar after buying her a drink . " Sarah , " she said , looking him straight in the eyes . " Cheers , " said Michael , downing the dark beer . " What ? " She could n't hear in the din . He put his lips next to her ear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked , scrunching her nose at thep127effect of the gin and tonic , looking at him for signs of aristocracy . " How 'd you guess ? " he said , smiling with unfamiliar breadth , becoming , in fact , this fictional Vincent who was British . " Just here getting set for a trade show , " he said during a lull in the music . " Really ? " she said , all interest now , having surrenderedthe other possibilities of the room . " An Englishman . Here for a trade show . " " Yes . I 'm in menswear . " " Yes , you are . I could tell that the moment you walked in . I said to myself , There 's a guy in mens-wear . " " Yes , well , lot of chaps here are in menswear , " he said , going along with the joke . " Most , in fact . " " Except for the odd bum in women 's panties . " " You think there are any of those in here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you , being an old and steady customer , I would n't put it past some of these Wall Street heroes . I do n't know what it is , but a lot of kinky behaviorcomes out of those stocks and bonds . " They spoke and bantered , and then there was a lull . Not a bad lull , just the sort of quiet spot you run into on a long highway . " How about a walk ? " she said finally . " Capital , " said Michael . " Come on , " she said , grabbing her coat . " You 're not that British . Nobody 's that British anymore . " " I suppose I 'm not , " he said , laughing . She was hungry and so was Michael , and they agreed on a popular , overpriced Italian restaurant on Second Avenue off Sixty-eighth Street.  | " You sure you can afford this ? " said Michael , looking at the menu . " Let 's get this straight upfront , Limey , " she said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underpaid menial in publishing . A junior editor . They pay us like they tip . You are , no doubt , an overpaid , underfed , upand-cominghotshot over here on a lavish expense account . Whatever you 've heard about American feminism , it does not extend to equal pay and sharing the price of dinner . So , young Cratchet , you are buying . If not , I 'm going back to that Yuppie sinkhole and wangle a free meal from somebody else . " He laughed because he recognized the keen range of candor and truth that lay beneath Sarah 's declaration . " Now , " she sighed , picking up the oversized , overpricedmenu , " shall I order ? " " I 'll have the northern Italian crow , " he said happily . The food came quickly and in large portions . Salad . Veal . Pasta . She ate with an appetite , Michael noted . As they lingered over tea , they went through the usual revelations . " Life on Long Island was dull , my schools were dull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  although they are nice , decent , but dull people  --  and I was convinced that I was born in the wrong generation , " she said amiably , in that happy glow of afterdinnercontentment . " How so ? " " Oh , I guess I wanted to be a hippie and a rebel and have my wild , overstated anger spilling onto the streets , " she said glibly . " You know : Vietnam , drugs , civil rights . " She shrugged . " All before my time . " He shook his head . " You Americans . " And he laughed.  | " Yeah ? Well , we knocked your block off in the war . What 's wrong with Americans ? " " Nothing . I like Americans . Just a little melo-dramatic . " " Oh , I see . Disproportionate in our emotions , is that it ? " " Something like that . " " Not constipated , like some members of a former world empire I could name . " " Tactless , " he said , handing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business card , the one prepared to go along with the credit card : " Vincent O'Dell , Representative , Loch Knit Menswear , London , Ipswich , Aberdeen , Dublin . " She studied the card . " What exactly does a representativedo , besides represent ? " He sighed , looked around . Nothing but diners in the restaurant . " Actually , a lot of espionage ... " " I thought you had a surreptitious air about you . Secretintentions . That sort of thing . " He laughed . " No . More in the garment line . Look to see what the next fellow is up to for spring . Actually , I 'm trying to find out which way skirts are going . " " How does that affect menswear ? " " That should n't be too hard to figure out . " They were both smiling . He was wondering how he was going to conceal his gun when he made his move.  |p130The  small sign with black letters outside Apartment 3W said SALVATORE BONIFICE , COUNSELOR AT LAW . Underneath , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUNG PROFESSIONALS THROUGH OUR COMPUTER MATCHUPS . Salvatore Bonifice  --  Sally Bones  --  conducted businessout of one of those modern apartments with waferthinwalls that had been converted into an office . The small bedrooms with the desks and cabinets never looked like anything but the improvised headquarters for a porn ring . All those formica-wood lamps and torn leather couches and artificial plants growing dusty on cheap coffee tables  --  it could have been a motel office , an airport , a 7-Eleven , a dental clinic  --  another interchangeablepart in the assembly line of America . An anyplace , anything , anywhere.  |p131Above  and around and underneath lived the airline stewardesses and doubled-up secretaries who pooled together for the thousand-dollar-a-month rent . They all had small , hard , hunter eyes , looking for a male to snare . There were also tiny , one-bedroom apartments kept by the aging lawyers from Queens Boulevard on the pretext that there were nights when they worked late , but really for their sweaty , frustrating assignations . The traffic into Apartment 3W ran a wide range of desperation and defiance . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacketswho were there to arrange for plead-outs on charges of possessing guns or drugs . Sometimes they were there bailing out a son , the next surly generation of grubby , small-time criminals . And then there were the shy , painfully sad , lonely " young professionals "  --  mostly disappointed low-level white-collar clerks with no apparent social skills who had screwed up whatever courage it took to come there and now had to be posed and cajoled like babies in front of the video camera . Jack Mann waited while Sally Bones escorted one tight-lipped , hopelessly plain young woman to the door after the usual ordeal of forced smiles and maximized assets . The poor thing kept her head down as if she were coming out of a police lineup , heading for the six o'clock news . Sally ushered her out , watched her go , kept smiling , shook his head . " Who 'm I gon na find for a dog like that ? " " I do n't know , " replied Jack . " Maybe she ai n't such a dog like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting on the torn-up couch . He motioned for Jack to follow him into what he liked to call his private office , which was located behindp132a door encrusted with undeserved civic awards from the Kiwanis and the War Veterans and Catholic Charities . Sally sat behind a desk that took up almost all of the room . It would have been the smaller bedroom in a two-bedroom on the A line , noted Jack . The master bedroom was where Sally conducted his interviews with the computer candidates . There , in front of the white screen and on a hard stool , the candidates squirmed and spilled whatever details Sally demanded . When Jack once happened to overhear one of the interviews , he blushed and moved out of range . They were conducted like police interrogations , and the subjects broke under Sally 's harsh lights . The guest chair in the small office was pushed in close , and Jack had the feeling that his shirt was too tight . Behind Sally was a view of the side street . Not even Queens Boulevard , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false . " Drink ? " asked Sally . " Scotch , " said Jack , who had met Sally when he was a cop . He had had a low opinion of him even then , and it was hard to keep it out of his voice now , although he was scratching for help from this same demihood . " Sorry . Out of scotch . " " That 's okay . Whatever . " " Harvey 's Bristol Cream . " " Fine . " Sally swiveled around in his chair , getting the glasses on one side and then twisting to get the liquor on the other . He poured stingy portions and then hit the intercom . " Hey , I 'm running outta liquor , " he growled to his secretary . " I 'll pick some up tomorrow , " said the sullen voice ofp133his secretary , a busty young woman with no obvious gifts beyond the obvious . The door burst open and she stood there , chewing her gum . " Yes , Gina ? " said Sally , gritting his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , looked at Jack , smiling . " What is this , a stickup ? " " Ya want booze , I need something to give the man behind the counter . That 's how they do it . You give them money , they give you booze . " " I 'll give it to you later , " said Sally , brushing her away . " As you can see , I 'm busy . " She stood there . " I 'm goin ' home . " Sally looked at his watch . " It 's only five , " he said . " Yeah , well , my mother 's sick and she needs me . " Her nasal voice was thick with complaint . " Okay , okay , " said Sally , fumbling in his pocket . There was no room behind the desk and he was fat , and the whole exertion made him grunt and look ridiculous . He was fuming by the time he peeled off two twenties and handed them to the secretary . " Get a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'll be a little late . I got ta take my mother to the clinic . " " Okay . Fine . I hope she 's better . " When she finally closed the door , Sally flung out a hand , as if to hurry her off . " She types all day . Same letter . Gives it to me at the end of the day  --  five fuckin ' mistakes . " " She looks competent , " said Jack , glancing behind him at the door.  | " Not a big letter , " continued Sally , fuming . " Two fuckin ' lines . No big words . Five mistakes . She misspellshospital . After looking it up . All fucking day long . " " I suppose she presses too hard . " Sally gave Jack a quick look . " Some people do not behave well under pressure . " Jack shrugged . " She came in here and I thought she was here for the computer matchup , you know ? God ! So , I take her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the questionnaireand she just does it . " Sally shook his head , remembering . " I should have known how dumb she was . But , my God , she had tits . Did you see the tits ? " Jack nodded to be polite . " Then she says , Uh , Mr. Bonifice , is all this personal stuff necessary ? ' I still do n't catch on , so I say , Yeah , sure . She just goes on filling it out . Do you really have to know what kind of fella I like ? ' Of course , I say . How 'm I gon na find someone for you if I do n't know what to look for ? She looks at me . Not a brain in her head . Wide eyes lookin ' at me . I already got a boyfriend , ' she says . Boy ! That opened my eyes . So then I tumble and I glom that she 's here for a job . " " Me , too , " said Jack . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe he had half a brain . Only a very dumb guy can take a broad like that . I mean , even tits get boring after a while . You got ta have something attached to them . " He sat there , looking at Jack , smiling , as if he had disclosed some great secret . Jack smiled back . Sally tried to stick his feet up on his desk , but they ,  |p135would  n't fit . Not without some very heavy pushing , which could propel him straight out of the window . This was something the man had to consider , thought Jack . Struggling back there , in that cramped space , if he was n't careful he could shoot himself right out of his own window like a paper clip from a rubber band . " What 's your fucking story ? " Sally snarled , still searching for some comfortable spot in that narrow alleybehind the desk . " You do the job ? " Jack handed him the bill and receipts from Chicago . Sally studied them , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking trip for that matter . Like he was trying to steal the $250 fee , not to mention the expenses . Which came to $312.98 . " Phew ! " whistled Sally . " I woulda done it for this . Whadja do , stay at the Drake ? " " I stayed at a men 's shelter and I ate gruel . There was a bathroom down the hall , which I shared with the hookers . You couldna done it , Sally . Not with your touchy bowels . " Sally snorted and pulled out the top drawer , which pushed against the bulge of his belly , making it more prominent , like a push-up bra . He practically destroyed the desk-size checkbook , ripping it from the drawer , grumbling and making noises of protest all along . " Listen , why do n't we make it an even five hundred bucks ? " Jack got mad . " Do n't fuckin ' nickel and dime me , Sally . I went cheap because I want to work for you again . I did n't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nickel and dime me . " " Okay . Okay . " Sally wrote out the check . He pressed the pen hard against the paper , squeezing out the last nickel . Five hundred sixty-two dollars and ninety-eight cents . Jackp136picked it up , read it over as if he was studying it , markingthe spot for Sally so that he would know this was important on both ends . He folded it carefully and put it delicately into his wallet . Then he seemed to relax . " I hear you got some of the airport action . " It was a guess , but a good one , considering Sally 's low-level connections . " That 's right . Where were you ? I was handing out candy all morning . Playing with your dick ? " " I was getting some sleep after Chicago . Remember , I did n't sleep in the fleabag hotel ? " " You shoulda called me , " said Sally . " You know something , Jack , you got no luck . You 're never in the right place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sally , but he was pleased by this insight . Sally liked to see people suffer bad fortune . He enjoyed a bad break befalling his fellowman . It made him feel lucky and he could n't help smiling at his own good fortune . Jack shrugged . He knew about luck and bad timing . " Now I got nothing , " said Sally , holding up his hands , revealing how empty they were . Jack nodded . He started to get up . " Wait a minute , " said Sally , waving Jack back into his seat . " You know , this is a pretty big deal ... " " I heard . " " Well , it does n't matter what you heard . You take whatever you heard and multiply it . " " A lot of heat , huh ? " Sally raised his eyebrows ; he was a man accustomed to speaking in guarded ambiguity against government wiretaps and bugs . " Listen , listen , " said Sally , trying to rise and lift himself to lean over the desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is gon na rattle everybody 's cage . The boys are after lungs . " Jack nodded . " Major , " whispered Sally , looking from side to side ; Jack actually found himself glancing around to see if someone had slipped into the office . " Major , major ! " Sally reached into his drawer , cursing and muttering , and pulled out his thick calendar . He fumbled with a pair of glasses and began reading through it . " Listen , I ca n't give you anything that 's already out there , but hey , for an old cop . Whyncha check out some stuff ? Go talk to some old pals . Ask a couple of questions . " He wanted Jack to use his connections . All the chains would be pulled to flush out an answer . " I can give you , what ? Hundred twenty-five a day , no expenses . " Jack hesitated . " I 'll take a hundred plus expenses . " He would have done it for nothing . Sally peeled two hundred-dollar bills off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before that morning , Jack would have been impressed by the roll . " Here 's two days , " said Sally . " Call me tomorrow . " He scribbled a phone number on a scrap of paper . " On this line . "  |p138The  chop shop was buried deep in an industrialforest of rust and junk in Flushing . There were defensive perimeters of old cars , one piled on top of another , as if some playful monster had arranged it , stacked the cars like building blocks , to protect the inner workings of the shop from storm . There were mountains of worn-out tires , past all possibleuse , stored for no particular purpose , except the obvious  --  abarrier against intruders . The local police knew what went on in the Western Motors Repair Yard . It was common knowledge that expensivestolen cars were torn apart and then put back together so that they could n't be traced . But there was an understanding . The chop shop could remain in operationas long as it paid its fair share of bribes and as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These terms Dino 's father was always careful to meet . And hisp139son was raised on these understandings , made to appreciatethem as terms of honor . Barry found his way through the labyrinth to the small office in the rear of that great worn-out heap . Dino was behind the desk , painfully smearing grease and ink over a maintenance form , scowling , as he always did when he had to perform the odious paperwork . The pen was stuck between his fingers like a thorn . Young Dino did n't bother to look up when Barry came through the door . The sentries dt front with walkie-talkies had already announced him . " I 'm glad you got the money , " he said ; he knew that if Barry did n't have the money he would n't be there . " I got it . " " I always hate to hurt a friend , " said Dino , looking up , smiling . Funny thing was that he meant it . Barry was a likable guy . He had a sweetness that even a hard guy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to be taught a lesson , thought Dino , whose notion of a lesson was the smashing of a major bone . Barry took out stacks of twenties from his shopping bag . He counted $12,540 , then put the rest back . At first Dino was agape , then he began to salivate . Large amounts of cash had that effect on him . But he hardly paid attention to the pile of payback cash . He figured that he already owned that . He was more interested in what Barry put back into the Bloomingdale 's shopping bag with the old shirt pushed down on top as a stopper . Two men who had been standing in the corner stiffenedat the sight . Barry noticed them suddenly . He had n't paid attention at first because there were always stray characters hanging out in the chop shop . It didn'tp140matter . Everyone knew that Dino had a protected business . No one was going to commit a crime on this property . It was as safe as a police station . But now Barry saw that the two strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet ties . Junior executives of crime . " Lemme make a guess , " said Dino , sitting down , smiling , putting the paperwork aside . " You knocked over a crack house . " Barry laughed , even as he noticed one of the two strangers moving between him and the door . " I told you , " he said . " I got lucky in a card game . " " Right , " said Dino . " I keep forgetting . " " Musta been some card game , " said the younger , smaller hood . A long scar ran from his forehead across his eye and down to his cheek . Barry wondered how he was n't blinded . " It was a helluva card game , " he said , and there was a quiver in his voice . He knew that he was in trouble . " Look , Dean , do n't bother with a receipt . . . " Dino laughed . The others smiled . " But I really got ta go . " " Hey , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Ferrari ? " " Yeah , I really do , but lemme come back another time . " " Hey , man , I kept that thing for you . I had another buyer , but I sent him away . " The small hood with the mean look spoke up . " Hey , you owe him a look . He sent a guy away . You would n't wan na insult him by not even lookin ' , would you ? " Everyone laughed except the man by the door . He just stood there , a sentry , knowing his duty without a word being spoken . It was as if a tree had fallen across Barry 's escape route.  | " Do I have a choice ? " said Barry with a forced laugh . " I do n't think so , " said the small hoodlum . They walked into the back , through the noisy car shop bay where the mechanics and master cutters were splicing together the jigsaw of cars . They marched into a storage room , kicked out the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They seated Barry down on the hard wooden chair , in the full glare of a bright light , and did n't even bother to try to take away the shopping bag , which he clutched in his lap . " Tell me about the card game , " said the short , smilinghood . Barry looked around and saw Dino with his arms folded across his chest . " That 's okay . That 's Al . You can tell him almost anything . " Al stood in front of Barry . On his right stood the other one , the tree . " So , Barry , tell me about the card game , " insisted Al . Barry was sweating . " It was a card game . Classic poker . Five-card stud . " He shrugged . " Where was this fabulous card game ? " " A hotel . We took a room . " " Which hotel ? " " The Americana . " " Who played ? " " I do n't understand . " AI laughed . The sinister Richard Widmark laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand the ques-tion . " Dino leaned over at Barry . " He wants to know who the other players were in this card game . He might wan na play with these guys himself , if they 're such good losers . " It was damp and cold in this back room , but it felt asp142if he had a mouth full of cotton . " Fellas , " he pleaded , " what 's goin ' on here ? " AI opened his coat . Barry could see the gun . It was too big for such a little thug . Tucked nicely into the suit . Barry had a gun in the bottom of the shopping bag . By the time he got it out , he figured , he 'd be dead . The gun was useless . He was n't even sure if it was loaded . It was a gun he 'd bought off some dealer on the street four years earlier . He did n't remember if it was loaded . " Inform our dumb friend , " said Al , nodding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning in , trying to make it baby clear , " there 's a fuckin ' nuclear war goin ' on . " Barry looked confused . " Last night , did n't you hear about this ? " Barry shook his head . Al took up the explanation . " Someone robbed a payroll at the airport . It was not a neutral act . This payroll belonged to people who do not get robbed . You know what I mean ? It 's like a doctor does n't expect to get sick . " Barry held the bag tighter . As if it was threatened . This did not go unnoticed by Al or Dino or the thick hulk of a tree . " I better make a call , " said Dino , unlocking the door and leaving Barry with the two hoodlums . " I think maybe that bag full of money does not belong to you , " said the little thug when they were alone . " It 's a guess . But I 'm willing to bet your life that it 's not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Barry , trying to fake indignation , " this is definitely my fuckin ' money . " The small one leaned over and slapped him across thep143face . It stung . " Watch how you talk to me , Barry . I do n't like a punk with a big fuckin ' mouth . " The big one cracked a smile . " Now , tell me about the fuckin ' money . " " I was in a card game  --  " The little one slapped him again . Harder . Blood begantrickling out of his mouth . " No one loses that kind of money in a card game without some noise . We got people in the Americana . We got people everywhere . You think we would n't hear ? Lemme clear you up on this . This is a very seriousbusiness . Do n't fuckin ' lie to me . " " I was in a card game at the America  --  " The little one leaned over and slapped Barry so hard that he fell off the chair , spilling the contents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and could taste the blood in his mouth . I 'm not gon na get out of here alive , he thought . That mean little fuck is going to hurt me and then he 's going to kill me . AI turned away . He had hurt his hand on Barry 's teeth . He did n't want to show it . Barry felt the gun under his belly . His hand was wrapped around the grip . He rolled over and uncoiled and aimed and put a bullet in the belly of little Al , who looked down amazed at the spurt of blood and gore pouring out of his custom-made shirt all over his Paul Stuart suit and onto the floor of the room . The tree leaped up in the air in sheer surprise . As if he could jump over the richochet . Barry could see his eyes open wide and the beginning of countermeasures . The tree wasted a split second , which was just enough time for Barry . He swiveled and fired twice into thep144face of the tree  --  obliterating it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by lightning . " Ohhhh ! " cried Al , who slumped to the floor . His legs were twitching . He was dying , if not already dead . Barry was calm . He got up and stuffed a few of the stacks of bills into his pockets , leaving the bulk of the money scattered around the floor . He thought , I have to run . I have to get away . The door was locked , and he fumbled with the knob . He had to just slide the bolt , but he got excited . Finally he managed to work the lock , and he slipped out of the room and into the bay . There was the buzz and hum of a factory . The high , metal whine of metal cutting metal . He saw Dino coming across the floor , looking confused at the sight of him walking unescorted . A mechanic was working on the Ferrari a few feet away , listening to the purr of the engine , and Barry pushed him out of the way , closed the hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended , ready to fight , unwilling to tolerate rude behavior . He did n't grasp what was taking place . Dino was looking back and forth , undecided whether to run into the storage room and check on Al and the tree or to try to stop Barry . Barry put the Ferrari in gear and released the brake and roared out of the Western Motors Repair Yard . Sarah lay in bed trying not to shiver . It was n't the aftermath of sex  --  although that was nothing to sneeze at . It was a sudden recognition of danger . She 'd spotted the gun when she went to the bathroom . It was under his slacks , tucked away . Hidden . Almost . But unmistakable . Lethal metal look . A gun . No doubt . It did n't register at first . It did , but it did n't . A gun . So what ?  |p145Another  jittery Bernie Goetz lying in wait in the subway . But then she saw him watching her when she came out of the bathroom . Not asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed back into bed , her back to him , and clamped her eyes shut . Her head was buzzing with worry and fear , and she almost did n't hear him move . She felt the bed dip a little . That was all . And then his arm on hers . Her eyes fluttered and she moaned somewherebetween fear and lust . " Oh , God ! " she cried as he turned her around , lifted her nightdress and took her again , this time in a harsher fashion . Later , as they lay there spent , they spoke in that safe intimacy of the dark , each looking up at the ceiling as if they were talking on the telephone . " Are you some kind of a cop ? " she asked . " Some kind , " he replied , although he did n't know why he answered such a question . This was not his usual tactic of silence . " I do n't think you 're a cop , " she said after a while . " Why not ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to know some cops , " she said . " The thing about cops is that they are very conventional fellows . " " Really ? " " They like to drink beer and talk tough , but actually they 're very ordinary . " " Like uncles . " " More like aunts . " It was the first time she 'd heard him laugh . Then he remembered who he was . She could hear the air go out of his laugh . She could feel him tense.  |p146She  could feel the bed dip as he got up and went to the window and looked out onto the street . He could n't see anyone . But he thought he saw somethingmove in the shadows across the street . Nothing definite . A quick movement and then it was gone . " If you feel like talking , " she began , then saw his face when he turned and looked at her . It was not quite scorn , but it was close and she felt as if he had slapped her face . She flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " she spit out . " I have to go , " he said . He dressed like a whisper . Moving automatically , getting into his things , yet staying alert , aware of Sarah 's position . She could actually see him listening . He made no attempt to conceal the gun . Checked it , put it back in the holster and tucked it behind his belt . Then he looked at her , as if to warn her that he knew she was watching , that he did this openly to emphasize it . He kept looking through the curtain into the street . Something was out there . He was certain . He could feel the prickles of an enemy presence . " I have to go , " he said , standing at the door . " Go , " she replied bitterly . Once the door closed behind him , it was as if he had never been there . He was a lost soldier deep in enemy territory . Only the ears and eyes were engaged . His mind was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood for a long time in the doorway waiting to see something give itself away . When he saw an ordinary couple coming down the street he waited again , then fell in behind them , like a submarine slipping into a defended harbor behind anothership.  |p147The  couple speeded up , thinking that Michael might be a mugger , but he remained close enough to discouragewhoever or whatever it was dogging him in the shadows . When he reached Second Avenue , he boarded a bus , then got off after one stop . He had his gun in his overcoat pocket now . He was spiked and ready to kill . A man coming alone down the street almost died . But then Michael recognized that he was just an innocent civilian out buying a newspaper . Suddenly he found himself in the heart of a cluster of Irish bars . This city ! he thought . You ca n't keep up with the damn thing . One minute you 're in some posh Episcopaliansection where all the women wear sable and all the men wear cashmere and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner and you 're in a workingclassghetto where the pubs are back-to-back and the drunks vomit every ten feet . His hotel was to the west , he was sure . He 'd lost his bearings for a moment , but then he saw the lights of the Empire State Building to the south and was guided by that star . He ducked into an all-night restaurant and took a seat at the counter , where he could watch the street . If there was someone out there , he still could n't nail him . Whoeverit was was very good . He ordered tea and toast , and thought , giving himself a stray minute , that he liked that Sarah . He felt rested in her bed . But he shook the thought away ; it was like sleep overtaking him on a highway . The thought of Sarah could kill him . He had sworn off women . He had taken an oath of celibacy . He finished his tea and took a bite of his toast and paid his check and used another customer as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting late and there was no one waiting.  |p148But  at the hotel the message light was lit on his telephone . " A man who said you would know who he was , " said the operator , reading from a slip . " He did n't leave a number . " Michael felt a chill run up his back . Maybe they were coming . Wednesday , November 4 , 12 Midnight , 105 Hours 45 Minutes and CountingThe phone kept ringing . Jack counted twenty rings . He stood in a phone booth off the Expressway , watching the Buick parked by the curb and trying to find Barry . " C'm on , you little asshole , " he muttered . Finally , on the twenty-first ring , someone picked it up . " Barry ? Is that you ? " " Uncle Jack ? " " Where the fuck have you been ? " " Here , Uncle Jack . Where could I go ? I do n't have a car . " " Why did n't you answer ? " " I thought you did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it ring . You know , you really should get an answering machine . " " I hate those things . " " Yeah , but at times like this ... " " Is everything all right ? " " Yeah , sure . Why do you ask ? "  | " No reason , you little jerk . " " Oh , yeah . Everything 's great . What about with you ? " " Fine . Fine . Did the phone ring a lot ? I mean , were there a lot of calls ? " " Some . Hard to say . " " Hard to say ? Why is it hard to say ? " A few teenagers were playing in the street . One of them sat on the fender of the Buick . " Hey ! " screamed Jack , leaning out of the phone booth . " Get off that car ! " The teenager blinked and ignored Jack . " Listen , I got ta run , " he told Barry . " Uh , when are you gon na be home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garage . " I do n't know . Maybe not until late . Why ? " " No special reason . " The teenagers had all climbed aboard Jack 's Buick , which now looked like the jungle gym in The Birds . Stupidto challenge them , Jack thought . " Watch out ! " cried one of the teenagers in mock horroras Jack came out of the booth . " Here come the deee-tective . " " Gon na get us for sitting on a badass Buick , " said another . " Thas a serious charge , ai n't it , Parker ? " " A lot of time on that one , " replied Parker . Jack felt like an idiot . He hung his head and went around to the driver 's side and opened the door and started it up . This is what comes of having guilt feelings , he told himself . You start acting like an asshole . " Oh , please , mister deee-tective , do n't shoot ! " cried the first teenager.  | " He be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thas the law . " Jack started rolling with the teenagers all sitting on the fender . They fell off , one by one , and began screaming , as if they 'd been hurt . " Oh , I 'm run over , " was the last thing Jack heard as he picked up speed and pulled away , heading back into the airport . The booth attendant at the long-term lot was still on duty . It was the same man Jack had seen the night before . He did n't recognize Jack , who left the Buick in a metered lot far away in case the car might be recognizable . " The real cops were here all day , " he said , looking at Jack 's card with a miniature of the Private Investigator 's laminated license on it . He handed the card back to Jack  --  a sign of disinterest . " I did n't have nothin ' to tell the real cops , either . " " Well , I thought I 'd get lucky , " said Jack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were crawling around on their hands and knees looking for clues . " " Did they find anything ? Did you notice ? " " Nah ! You kiddin ' ? These guys were pros . They were n't gon na leave clues lying around . " " No . I guess not . " Jack found himself in the airport bar , ordering a beer . He was feeling sorry for himself . Well , he thought , he would just dump the money and get clean . It was stupidto flirt with disaster like this . Then , absently , he began to clean his nails . He was using a book of matches . He looked down and blinked . He didn'tp151smoke . He never carried matches . Where had they come from ? He tried to read the cover , but it was too dark in the bar . He took them over to a table and held them under a light . The cover said " The Shebeen , a touch of the old country on Cross Bay Boulevard in Queens . "  |p152They  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay , " said Tom Fiske , the writer , so-called , who worked behind the bar whenever Larry , the regular bartender , was too hung over or Martin too preoccupied to perform the pouring functions . " Are you ready ? " " C'm on , c'm on , " said Frank , an impatient constructionman who placed his clenched fists like loaded weaponson top of the bar . " Let 's get something going , man . " Fiske , the so-called writer , slapped a fiver down on the wet bar ; you could almost hear it splash . Then he filled up four mugs of ale from the spigot , all held in the grip of one hand , and set them down . One for Frank . One for Martin . One for himself . And one for this newcomer , Jack . Jack  --  a little removed at the far end of the bar , but still close enough to be counted in the group  --  started top153push a ten across the counter to pay for the drink , but Fiske held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on our friend , here . Is n't it , Frank ? " " I 'll be too old to enjoy it , " said Frank , who did not like any kind of foreplay . " The boys , " said Nora in Jack 's ear , throwing a thumb over her shoulder at the men at the bar . " They think they 're expert at fine humor . " Then she felt the swift burn of an embarrassing revelation  --  she had been caught with her emotions showing . There was no doubt that she had taken a sudden liking to this man , Jack , who had walked into the Shebeen out of the thin rain . He had a nice laugh and he also had a glint of somethingsturdy in his eyes . She was n't sure which of the two traits was more attractive . Fiske began his joke , and the usual happy hush that precedes a good joke fell across the bar . " It 's the olden days , see ? " started Fiske . " What are you talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursery rhyme or a man 's joke ? Let 's hear a real story , for the love of Christ . " " You must be a pleasure on the job , " said Martin . " What do you do , try puttin ' up the roof before you have the foundation laid ? " " Never mind , never mind , " shot back Frank , poundingthe bar with his fists , a child demanding his satisfaction . " Have you got a joke or is this pissing in the wind ? " " It 's the olden days , " hissed Fiske , leaning across the bar , enjoying the sweat of the steelworker . " In France . " " Oh , in France , is it ? " mocked Frank . He looked around . " In France , " he said to Jack , nodding . " Will you shut up , Frank , and let the man tell hisp154damned joke , " shot Martin , who was in fact in a frenzy over something else entirely . " Who 's stopping him ? Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got one . Which I tend to doubt . I smell a long stall here . " " So this fellow Quasimodo is the bell ringer , " continuedFiske , undaunted . " You know ? The Hunchback of Notre Dame . Well , Quasimodo needs an assistant  --  " " So do you , I think , " laughed Frank , looking around , enjoying his own joke . Jack smiled at him , soothing , rather than as an accomplice . " This young kid shows up from the provinces . Well built . Strong . But he has no arms . " " No arms ? " asked Martin , as if the joke were a puzzle . " Well , Quasimodo says , You ca n't be an assistant bell ringer . Not without arms . ' The young man says , Just try me . ' Okay . Okay . So he gives him a try , and the kid goes up to the bell tower and he smashes his head up against the bell . Nothing . A small , thin sound . " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begs the kid . Quasimodo is skeptical . But the kid begs and pleads and he takes a running start and he hits the bell and , again , nothing . A plink . Well , that 's it , says Quasimodo . This is crazy . But the kid begs . Once more , once more . Please , please , please ! So , okay , Quasimodo gives him one more chance , and the kid takes a long running start and smashes his face into the bell and it gives off a lovely sound . It rings out with a clarity and depth they had never heard before . Only the bell swings out and comes back and knocks the young lad out of the bell tower window . He falls a hundred and fifty feet and is killed on the stone slabs of the churchyard . Well , all the townspeople from Parisp155who have been drawn by the lovely sound come by and they stare at the dead boy . Finally , one of the citizens says to Quasimodo , Who was this lad ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch line . " I do n't know his name , but his face rings a bell . " Everyone looked up , startled . It was quite a shock . Who was this strange upstart , comes in and steals a punch line ? Only Nora laughed , but then she saw the wounded look on the others and she downgraded it into a smile . " It 's his five , " she said , taking the wet bill and passing it over . " It 's not , " said Fiske , smoldering . " No , " said Frank . " It 's not . Why not ? " " Because that 's not the punch line , " answered Fiske . " Oh , c'm on , " said Nora . " The rules are that anyone can claim a punch line . " " That 's not the punch line , " insisted Fiske . " Well , then , let 's hear the real punch line , " said Martinmaliciously . " Another kid comes in from the country , " said Fiske , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And no arms . In fact , he 's the twin brother to the first lad . " Fiske was addressing Jack , whose face was sunk into the mug of ale . " Same deal , " continued Fiske . " Let me ring the bell . Quasimodo finally agrees , and sure enough , on the third try , when he gets a beautiful note , the bell knocks him out into the courtyard and kills him . The citizens gather around and they ask Quasimodo again , Who was this young lad ? " Fiske leaned farther across the bar and spoke straight to Jack . " Do you know the ending to this joke , too ? "  |p156Jack  shrugged and said , " I do n't know his name either , but he 's a dead ringer for his brother . " Fiske slammed the rag down on the bar . Frank came over and shook Jack 's hand . " That was lovely , " he said . " Truly lovely . For two years I 've been waiting to see that man get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two twenty-dollar bills on the bar . Frank moved closer to Jack . " I 'm bettin ' on  --  what 's your name ? " " Jack . " " I 'm puttin ' twenty on Jack . " " This is the story of St. Peter and Jesus at the Pearly Gate , " said Fiske . " Give us some ale first , " said Nora , and Fiske did , never taking his eyes off Jack , as if he were a dangerous gunfighter who had to be watched . " Jesus comes by and St. Peter says , Listen , would you mind takin ' over for a bit , I just want to get a smoke . " Jack could n't help himself : " Is the punch line Pinochio ' ? " They could tell from Fiske 's face that Jack was right . Fiske 's face just hung there , as if it had taken a sharp , painful , humiliating blow , which it had . The seconds ticked by , and then Frank could n't stand it anymore . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a disgusted Fiske , adding a shot of whiskey to his beer . " Well , as I remember it , Jesus comes up to the Pearly Gates and St. Peter asks him to take over while he gets a smoke . What do I do ? ' asks Jesus . Oh , ' says St. Peter , just ask their names and what they do and if they 've led a good life . ' So the first guy up is this little old man and Jesus asks his name . Well , ' he says , inp157your language , it would be Joseph . ' Fine , Joseph , and what did you do in life ? " l was a carpenter . " And were you a good man ? " Oh , yes , ' says Joseph . I took care of my wife and my only son . ' Suddenly Jesus freezes . Your name is Joseph , you were a carpenter and you had an only son ? Father ! ' The old guy looks over at Jesus and says , Pinocchio ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . Then Fiske got mad again and bent closer . " How can you tell an elephant is in your bed ? " " He wears a E on his pajamas , " replied Jack . " How can you tell an elephant 's been in the re-frigerator ? " " Because of the footprints in the jar of peanut but-ter . " Fiske looked at him carefully . " Are you some kind of professional ? " Jack laughed and shook his head . He could n't buy his own drinks after that . They were coming so fast that the bar was wet with spillage . He noticed Martin , however , stealing out of the back door , then coming back in and hovering by the telephone . Martin 's eyes were all flickering lights , like some bad electrical connection . There was traffic in the bar . Timmy Madden came off his night shift at Con Edison . He blew into his hands and put down three straight shots of whiskey before he was ready to settle for an ale . " You better take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " warned Fiske . " No problem , " said Timmy , smiling like a thief . " Her mother 's had a stroke and she 's gone to Dublin to take care of her . " " God bless the mother , " said Frank.  |p158They  all chuckled . " This is Jack , " said Frank , introducing his new friend . " Glad to know you , " said Madden , nodding down the bar . " He 's a professional ; just . beat Fiske at five punch lines , " added Frank . Madden 's eyebrows went up in a kind of salute . " Five , you say ? " " Maybe more . We lost count . The man was down in the dust bleeding , he was beaten so bad . " " Is this true , Fiske ? Do we have a new champion ? " " It is , " replied Nora . " Oh , it was grand . " " I was busy . I was tending the bar . " " You were beaten , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I had a bad night , but he 's good  --  I ' 11 admit to that . The man is fast . " Martin was outside again , taking the two young men who had come in out of the rain with him . They were hard-liners , Jack could tell . They had that unforgiving look . Baby killers , if it came down to that . Jack shivered and took another glass of ale . They were in the shed down by the water . Martin had the only other key . " Do you know how to operate all this ? " he asked . The smaller man  --  the one named Kenny  --  shot the bolt on the Uzi , pointed it at Martin 's heart and pulled the trigger . The click was loud , but not loud enough to drown out Martin 's whimper of fear . " God , man , do n't do that ! " he practically shouted . " You 've insulted our professionalism , " said the thick one , who was examining the ground-to-air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A truck came by and a silent man handed Martina note . It said : " For the shed . " He knew what that meant , but he did n't know it was coming or what it was until they started unloading . He could tell then that he was helping unload the spade that would dig his own grave . This is when he decided to try to make his own separate deal . He put in his telephone calls and connected to the right party . He did n't say much , just enough to establish his eagerness to cooperate . Nora had gotten a call from Michael with instructions . He told her to tell Martin that two men would be down in the evening to look over the equipment . Martin was to let them in and stay out of their way . Michael told her where he was staying and said it was only for her to know and use only in dire emergency . Any other use of the information would put everyone in danger . When Nora protested and said that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Martin did n't ask too many questions , but he was burning to know about the naval gear . Why the rubber boats and the inflatable pumps and the wet suits ? He was too frightened to challenge Michael , but he had a terrible fear that his life as a pub owner was coming to an end . When Nora slipped and mentioned the Plaza Hotel , Martin made a mental note and asked no more questions . " Give us a hand , " said the young one  --  the one with the sadistic gleam in his eyes . Martin was quick and helped them move half the bundles into the flatbed of a pickup . They left behind crates of ammunition and high explosives stacked under canvas ; it could blow the Shebeento hell , thought Martin.  |p160They  drove off , leaving Martin wet and deep into his mourning . Jack saw him come back in and slump into a chair in a dark portion of the restaurant . Something was going on out there . He had n't heard much , but he 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " What 's your funniest joke ? " said Fiske . Jack turned his attention back to the company at the bar . The barmaidwith the freckles was watching , and he sensed something there , too . " Well , there 's the one about the pig with the wooden leg . " " Pig with the wooden leg , " repeated Fiske , trying to retrieve the joke , trying to remember . But he was blank . " Tell us about the pig with the wooden leg , " said Nora , putting a pot of shepherd 's pie in front of Jack . She whispered , " You want to keep your wits with these fellows . Something hot inside helps . " " All right , " said Jack out loud . " It 's a traveling salesmanjoke . " And there was a groan from the connoisseurswho flat did n't like traveling salesman jokes . They considered them crude , beneath their standards of sophisticatedhumor . " Is that the best that a champion can do ? " asked Madden . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Nora , angry at her shameless self . " This traveling salesman sees this barnyard full of great-looking animals , " began Jack . " And in the back , behind the donkey and the cow and the chickens , there 's a pig with a wooden leg . "  | " If this is n't funny , you 're gon na buy for the house , " said Fiske . " He sees the farmer and he says , You know , I 've been admiring your animals ; you have some fine animalshere . ' And the farmer says , Yep . ' " You 've got a nice cow and some chickens and a mule and some sheep . But , let me ask you something , does that pig have a wooden leg ? ' And the farmer looks over and says , Yup . ' So the salesman can not contain himself . He 's nodding away and then he says , You know , I , myself , have never seen a pig with a wooden leg . Some of them starting giggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wooden leg . " The farmer says , That 's not an ordinary pig . That happens to be about the best pig in the whole world . See , about a year ago , the house caught fire . You can see the damage there where we have n't finished rebuild-. ing . Well , sir , it was a real bad fire . The baby was trapped upstairs in the bedroom and no one could get to her . Firemen , everyone , were driven back by smoke . But that old pig , well , sir , he broke through the line of police and he climbed up the stairs and he low-crawled through the smoke and he rescued that baby . Carried her down through the smoke and flames . Never saw anything like it . ' The salesman was astounded . Then , oh , ' bout six months ago , I was driving the pickup and I hit a pucker and she flipped on me . My leg was caught under the steering wheel . Could n't get out . I was done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't answer , but that old pig come for me . Swam a creek to get to me . The flames was getting closer and closer to the fuel tank and he just put his snout under that steeringp162wheel and lifted it straight up . Then he pulled me away from the truck and got me clear just before it all blowed up . Had n't been for that there pig , I was history . ' " That is truly amazing , ' says the salesman . Unbelievable . I never heard such a story . But if you 'll forgive my asking , how come the pig has a wooden leg ? ' " Mister , when you got a pig like that , you do n't eat him all at once . " He was the champion after that . They were doubled over in pain from laughing . Madden knocked over a pint in his agony . Fiske just filled it up again and began groaning in his own pain of laughter . Martin had n't heard the joke , but he wished to God that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he had Nora alone the kitchen , he asked her quietly , " Do you know what 's going on ? " She felt pity for him , sweating like that , ready to burst with worry . " Listen , Martin , I do n't know a thing . Michael uses me like a glass . I pass from lip to lip . I know as much as a glass . " " Do you know what they 've got out there ? " " I do n't . And I do n't want to know . Listen , Martin , it 's no use worrying about it . Michael will do what he wants and then he 'll be gone , God willing . There 's no point worrying about it . " She left him there , crouched over on a chair , like someone with a great intestinal eruption . It was late and the others were all gone . All except Jack . " I thought I could give you a ride home . " " I take the bus , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hate to deprive the Transit Authority of a fare , " he said . She wrapped herself in a coat and a kerchief.  | " I would n't want to take you out of your way , " she said . " Which way will you be heading ? " " I was going in your direction , " he said , and that ended that . They were silent in the car , except for her occasional instructions . " Turn left at the next light . " That sort of thing . But as far as small talk or conversation , the act of sitting together in the front seat seemed to cover it . Oddly enough , Jack felt as comfortable as if they were an old married couple . She looked bright-eyed and alert and without guile . A sound , solid woman with a wrist so small and fragile it might have belonged to a bird . When he glanced over and saw her there , in her tight little compact self , Jack wanted to take her in his arms , enfold her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stopped in front of her house and sat for a moment , both looking out of the front windshield as if they were staring at the passing scenery . " I am forty-seven years old , " he said finally . " Congratulations , " she replied . Then she softened . " I 've no social skills . None . My basic tendency is to putan elbow out to ward the fellows off . " " I can understand that . Fellows can get pretty obnox-ious . " She shook her head and snuck a peek at him . " You do n't look forty-seven , " she said . " Fifty , " he replied , and she laughed . " You do n't have many of the social skills yourself , now do you ? " " Out of practice , " he said . " I was married for a long time and I 'm not used to courtship . "  |p164She  shook her head . " God , you American men ! Shuck off wives like old boots . " " My wife died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will you come up for coffee ? " " I thought you 'd never ask . "  |p165Martin  sat alone in the dark booth near the front door , his soggy cap pulled low over his bleary eyes . He 'd sent them all home , gone out ' to make certain that they 'd gone , now drank the hard liquor in a hurry , storing it up . The knock on the door made him jump . It was the loud bang of a cop  --  just this side of breaking in . Arrogant bastards , thought Martin as he fumbled with the locks and bolts on the front door of the Shebeen . They marched in like cops  --  clumping and careless and suspicious , looking everywhere , trying to catch you at something sinister . Martin stood there at the door , wanting to hurry them , afraid someone would see . The big one , the leader , sent his flunky to check out the place . He nodded his head and the young one ran off like a trained puppy to sniff for traps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar as if he ownedp166the place , touching this and that , looking in the drawers , examining the papers . And Martin just stood by the door , shriveled up like his wet cap , feeling helpless , scowling and resentful , but knowing that it was all out of his hands now . The big one pulled a bottle of Hennessey off the shelf , grabbed a few glasses and settled himself with a sigh in a booth . He motioned for Martin to join him across the table . " You were right , " he said finally , cracking the silence . Martin was n't sure what he meant . But now he had hope . " You found him , then . " " Oh , we found him , all right . That was no problem . No . We found him . " He threw back a drink and looked around to see that his men were still on duty . Two of them . One at the window checking the street . The other  --  the puppy  --  standing back watching them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked weapon , waiting for an ambush . The big one blushed and tossed down the rest of his drink . " Here 's health to your enemies ' enemies , " he said . The big one opened his coat and showed the bulge of his holster and the rack of his handcuffs . Sergeant Frank Palleo  --  known as Bobby to the men in his specialantiterrorist task force  --  liked to establish up front that he was official . If you went against him , you were going against the law . " You know , " said Bobby , " he does n't look like a big fish . " " Are you kidding ? He 's the biggest . I happen to know for a fact that he 's done deeds that would take an army . . The young one in front , Detective Sonny Federicci , leaned in and whispered something to Bobby . Bobbyp167nodded and gestured for Sonny to move off and give them back their semblance of privacy . Bobby leaned across the table , pushed the bottle ahead of him . Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't have the money . " Martin nodded , swallowed the rest of the liquor , and looked up at the ceiling with eyes filled with tears . " I knew that he did n't , " he said . " I told you he would n't have the money . Did n't I tell you that ? He 's a big fish . Is n't he a big enough fish without the money ? " Bobby studied Martin for a moment . Blunt , brutal eyes . Could go either way , thought Martin . All depends on which way the wind is blowing . " I did say that , " whispered Martin hoarsely . " I did say that he did n't have the money . " " That 's the whole trouble , " said Bobby . " He does n't have the money . See , if he had the money , we 'd have something to work with . If you see what I mean . This way , we got nothing to work with . " Martin did n't know what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth between Bobby and Sonny , who had cold , killer eyes . No pity in them anywhere . Martin felt the pressure of not being able to speak , of being dumb , of not knowing what tack to take . Bobby did n't move . Sonny shifted his weight impatiently . He wanted action . He wanted to hurt Martin , who could sense the tense anticipation , the straining at the leash from the younger cop . " You do n't think I have the money ? " said Martin , his eyes swiveling wildly back and forth . " You do n't think that , do you ? " Bobby shook his head . " No , nah . You do n't know dink about the money . If I thought that , I 'd let Sonny give you a deep massage . You would n't be that dumb ,  |p168to  hold out like that . But let me ask you something , which is really bothering me : What 's this Michael doing here ? I mean , what the fuck is he doing here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would n't tell me . These people are tombs . They do n't talk . They go to their graves silent . But I know it 's big . I know that much . " " How do you know that ? " It was Sonny , and Martin was startled by the source of the question . Bobby looked reproachful . " Well , I know it 's big or he would n't be here . There 's no way that a man like Michael would come out into the open if it were n't something major . " " What else do you know ? " asked Bobby . " I know it 's soon . This weekend . He dropped enough hints about being out of here . He does n't like America . " " No shit ? What 's it , something we said ? " Sonny laughed at Bobby 's joke . " It 's soon . He could n't wait . He 's takin ' a lot of chances because of the time pressure . He would n't do that unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booth . " Martin , how could you be so stupid ? How could you think we could be so stupid ? Did you really think you 'd get away with it ? " " Get away with what ? Please . Get away with what ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . " " I know you did the job . You think I have no friends on the street ? You think I do n't know what goes down in my own backyard ? Do n't insult me . You recruited the team . You knew about the job . You sent them out . " " I never knew about the mob payroll job . I got a few friends . I admit that . They were helpers . Michael asked for helpers so I got him helpers . But I would never do ap169stupid thing like putting them on a mob payroll stickup . That 's crazy . " " Only a true asshole would do such a thing , " said Bobby . " And if this guy is who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Am I right ? " " He does n't know the territory . " " You , on the other hand , are a true asshole . " " Christ , no one would put them on Iennello 's payroll . No one sane . " " That 's right , Martin . Don Iennello is not the sort of man who tolerates that sort of thing . It makes him look foolish . And he hates to look foolish . He puts ice picks in the eyes of people who try to make a fool out of him . " " Please , tell me what to do . I called you because I know that you can help people in trouble . I thought if I helped you stop this Michael from doing whatever terriblething he is about to do you could help me . I do n't know what to do . " " See , the trouble is , even if we catch the guy , he still does n't have the money . We still have to find the money . In order to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . I ca n't go empty-handed . How would it look ? " " What should I do ? Tell me . " Bobby emptied another glass of liquor , rubbed his mouth , then grabbed Martin 's coat . " You find out about the money . " Then he and his friends clumped out . Loud . Like cops . Wednesday , November 4 , 8:00 A.M. , 97 Hours 45 Minutes and CountingDino managed to clean up the slaughter that had taken place in the chop shop . The mechanics and la/borers knew that something had gone on , but when you worked in a mob chop shop you looked away a lot . Dino called in a reliable and muscular cousin , and he backed up a van and he loaded the dead bodies wrapped in cheap carpets ( no use wasting an expensive rug ) and he drove out to Far Rockaway , where he dumped the bodies into the city 's waste . It was a neater and safer thing to do than calling the authorities . For one thing , it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police would have been forced to close him up , even if they were sympatheticand compromised by corruption . The press would have made it look bad if the police did n't close up an illegal chop shop after a double homicide . There was another factor that went into Dino 's calculations . Now he knew the solution to the mystery of the airport robbery . That information was worth more than the Ferrari Barry had stolen . He was , however , astonished that a soft pillow like Barry had managed to pull off such a high-wire heist . But you never know about people . Imagine Barry killingtwo experienced gunmen and then brazenly driving out of the shop like that ! Dino made an appointment with the man who would appreciate the information . He had to be careful . This was a man who trusted no one , whose first thought was a suspicion . He had to go to him candid and innocent . He took his time and he took care gettingready , like getting ready for a date . And he wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . After cleaning out the debris from under his fingernails , after combing his hair and putting on his bestp171suit , he went to see Don Daniello Iennello , the crime boss who controlled business in his neighborhood . Iennelloconducted business  --  such as it was  --  out of a small private club with blacked-out windows in the Howard Beach section of Queens . He ran small squads of numbers runners and cells of dope dealers and branches of loan sharks . Nothing big . Nothing on a citywide scale . Not like shaking down a whole union . But Iennello was the man to whom Dino and his father paid protection and he therefore represented the nearest high rung of Mafia authority . Outside of the Howard Beach Fish and Game Club on 104th Street stood a man with a hand inside his coat . The man stood there all year long . In the stench and suffocating heat of summer and in the sting and bitter wind of winter , the man was a staunch sentry . He never took his hand off the grip of the automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in his pocket . One round would stop a bus , but the man at the door did n't expect to have to stop a bus ; he was expecting a tank . " He 's waiting for me , " said Dino , and the guard at the door blinked , which was all the permission he would ever grant . Inside the club , two other men with granite faces stood on either side of the door . If one flagged or seemed to get distracted the other would snarl , snappinghim back to attention . " Defense in depth , " was the way Iennello , a private soldier ( who never saw combat but acted as if he had ) in World War II , put it . " If they wan na come in here , they got ta expect to take some losses . " Who it was , exactly , he expected to try to breakp172through his outer and inner rings of defense was n't clear . Certainly not the police . Cops were welcome . A lot of cops just walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribes . They had to pick up their information , which Don Iennello gave out like Christmas envelopes . To stay in business , he traded off one thing against the other  --  recognizing that there were certain lines that could not be safely crossed . He could not informon a brother member of the mob . But he could disrupt pirate operations . Cowboys who thought that it was safe to go out and peddle crack without a license from the local capo . Unconnected , unprotected criminals , without the whole life insurance of a mob friend . Such things were fair game . Probably Iennello feared the other mobs , or maybe some lone avenger . Someone getting even for some act of brutality he had committed in his wild youth when he spread violence like business cards , then forgot it . There was no telling . But Iennello felt better when he looked up from his endless game of solitaire and saw the guards on full alert . Iennello was an old man , and his digestive system was sending out messages that he could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless days . The message was usually delivered in the form of gas , and sometimes the boys inside the clubhouse preferred to be on the outside . When the flatulence was bad they would roll their eyes , and Iennello would notice and get angry . He had to ignore them because to recognize the reaction would be to admit that he was farting . Instead , he simplygot angry every time the aftermath of his long lunches escaped . " It 's Dino , " said one of the guards . " I can see that , " said Iennello testily . " You think I ca n't see ? "  |p173He  was on the phone , whispering . He was always whispering into the phone . As if the taps could n't pick up a whisper . " All right , all right . I hear what you say and I appreciate the suggestion . Do n't worry , I know how to reach you if I need you . " He dropped the phone and the guard picked it up and put it into the cradle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " he began . " Do n't tell so much and watch the fuckin ' door . Whatam I payin ' you for , you dumb shit asshole . " " I 'm sorry , Boss . " " Watch the door ! " Dino stood there , smelling something funny , and sensing an ominous mood . " You , sit down , " said Iennello . The table was situated in such a way that conversationswere difficult to overhear . " You want coffee ? " " No , thank you , Mr. Iennello . " " Scunnzato . Coffee . What 's wrong with you ? " Dino waited for the coffee , watching Iennello 's fiery looks at the two guards . Listening to his long , moist farts . Swamp gas , he thought . It smells like methane . We 're all gon na die here in this fuckin ' fake hunt and game club . " How 's your father , Dinatto ? " " Uh , he 's fine . Fine . " " That 's good . Good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Raise a nice son . How 's business ? People buy cars ? " " Great . Great . Everybody wants a car . This is Amer-ica . " One of the guards brought the coffee  --  thick , Italianp174roast in small demitasse cups . The old man poured in some anisette and a twist of lemon . " Now , " he said , leaning back , ready to listen , " what is it that you had to see me ? What 's so important ? " Dino leaned across the table , messing up the solitaire arrangement , causing a look of annoyance on Iennello 's face . " Don Iennello , I think I know who pulled the airport stickup , " he whispered . The old man sat upright . He looked around . " Boys , wait outside , " he said to the guards . When they were gone he turned back to Dino . " Fuckin ' FBI probably has this place bugged anyway . " He shrugged . " You got ta be careful , but you ca n't stop breathin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was expected . " Tell me , " said Don Iennello , folding his arms across his scrawny chest . Then Dino told the old man about Barry and the windfall and the twin killings . The old man did n't seem to mind much about the death of his two underlings . He hardly noticed . He was only interested in the money  --  and Barry . " A Jew ? " asked the old man after hearing all the details , or as much as Dino knew . Dino nodded . " That 's funny , " murmured the old man . " You do n't expect a Jew to act that stupid . Italians act stupid . I woulda sworn it was some Wild West gavonne , some cowboy from Brooklyn who thought he was gon na re-tire . " " This Barry used to deal some small marijuana for me , " said Dino . " Not much . Nickel-and-dime shit . " " Why you use a Jew ? " " His uncle 's a cop . Was a cop . He 's retired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They got ta be good . " " The uncle 's not a Jew . Just the nephew . " " And he takes care of his nephew . " " He kept him out of jail a few times . " " Sure . " " They were pretty close . This Barry , he lived with his uncle sometimes . " " Lived with him . Ah , ha . " " He had his own place , but when he got in trouble , which was a lot , he stayed with his uncle . " " This uncle , is he a thief ? " " Nah . Straight as an arrow . A real Boy Scout . Kept trying to straighten Barry out . " " So you do n't think the uncle stole the payroll . " Dino laughed . " You got ta know this guy . The uncle . Jack ? He would n't steal second base . The man 's pure as . . . as ... as anything . " The old man smiled . " Sure . Sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He finished off his coffee and lit one of his thin , twisted cigars , which smelled almost as bad as his refried lunch . " I want you to work with me , " he said finally . " You know , this is a DellaCorte family matter . One of the five major crime families . I 'm not in that league . I work for Don DellaCorte . If we solve this case , if we bring him the money and the head of the villain who stole it , this would be a very nice thing for me . It would put him in my debt . And I would take care that you were not forgotten . " " How can I help ? " The old man leaned across the table and put his hand on Dino 's arm . The fingers  --  all bent and stained  --   |p176looked  to Dino like the cigars that the old man smoked . " You will be my good right arm in this matter . I have some friends . Cops . We need a cop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's gon na help us . He calls me and he offers to help . You ca n't do this alone . My friend will help . " Dino felt a shiver , a premonition . This smelly old fart was cunning and calculating , and he could almost hear the gears at work , he could almost feel the talons sinking into his flesh . This could be bad . This could be very bad . Wednesday , November 4 , 8:00 P.M. , 85 Hours 45 Minutes and CountingBarry was at the window in the front of the house when he thought he heard something out in the backyard . He tiptoed across the house and peered out of the back window . Nothing there but shadows . He then made his way to the front . Did something move behind that tree ? Someone walked a dog . " I ca n't stay here , " he said out loud . But where would he go ? He could n't just leave . Not now . That would put his uncle in a trap . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't even remember eating it later . He stood by the window , eating his sandwich , staring into the street , sipping on a beer . When he thought about the lives he had taken in the back room of the chop shop he began to tremble . Thenp177he began to cry . He pulled a chair up to the window and wept and fell asleep . Suddenly he awoke , pulling apart the drapes . Barry squinted out into the street and his heart dipped . For there , across the road , was the unmistakable car bearing trouble . One of those plain sedans with two men in drab suits in the front seat . It could have been a police car . It could have been a rnob cruiser . The one thing that it could not have been was a normal , routine piece of traffic . Not even American Express sent goons like that to collect debts on their card . Barry did the only thing that he could think of . He cleaned the house . He washed the floors and scrubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break every now and then to look out front and confirm that the men in the drab suits were still waiting . Why were they waiting ? For reinforcements ? Of course , they could n't storm the house with two guys . No . They did n't know that Barry was inside . There was no car out front . The Ferrari was tucked away in the garage . They were waiting for someone to come home . Which is what jolted Barry out of his chores . " Uncle Jack ! " he cried . He would be coming home sooner or later . He would walk into the ambush . Barry could n't allow that . Nora was sitting in the bathroom , looking into the mirror . She shook her head . Not like her to tumble into bed with a stranger . To spend a day puttering in the kitchen and falling back into bed . To feel the arms of a man around her . To nuzzle in , to burrow down and feel that deep , deep comfort of a heart beating not yourp178own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lulled by this man . Jack , with that plain , uncomplicated face  --  she thought of him and smiled . She thought of him even though he was in the bathroom . She could hear the water running , and she smiled again . Whatever he was , whoever he was , he was no stranger . This was a warm , compassionate man , with the smell and vulnerabilities and strengths of a man . She giggled . A thing she seldom did . At the crucial moment he had gone limp . It was an endearing thing . Almost like a reassurance that he was n't dangerous . They lay together , cuddling like children , for an hour . There were no carnal moments . Except later , in the middle of the night , when she had awakened and saw him there , so innocent , so peaceful . And she had felt a great female stirring  --  a primal sob of desire and sympathy  --  andshe folded him in her arms . In the morning there was a honking and commotion in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bathroom window and saw the landlordpacing back and forth in a rage . He was unable to get his car out of the garage . The reason was the rusty bucket of bolts  --  Jack 's Buick . It was parked in the driveway , eating up half the sidewalk . Nora tiptoed into the bedroom and lifted the car keys out of Jack 's pocket . She put a coat over her nightdress , then went downstairs . " I told you about the driveway , " the landlord had shouted . He was a mean-tempered Greek named Plato who had tried on more than one occasion to test Nora 's availability , despite the fact that they all lived together under the same roof  --  him with his wife and five childrenand Nora . Now Plato was indignant , marching upp179and down the street , ranting against the real wound of Nora 's rejection . " I miss work . I lose money . What car is this ? " " This is my friend 's car , " she said , climbing behind the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Plato , turning to look up at Nora 's window . " You got a friend up there ? " Nora rolled up the window as Plato ran after the car . " I told you , no friends . No boyfriends . No sleepovers . This is my home ! " Jack had heard the shouting and then the familiar sound of his engine . He got to the window in time to see the car pulling away . He watched it heading down the street , around the corner , out of sight . He got a big lump in his throat . It was partially a fleeting thought that he had trusted someone who had betrayed him . He felt like a sailor who had been rolled on a drunk . But then he thought , it 's not that bad . She could n't know about the three million dollars in the trunk . At the worst she was stealing his car . He found a kettle and put some water on the stove . He made sure there was enough in it for two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard a knock on the door . She forgot her key , he thought . " Mister , pack up and move out ! " shouted the intruder , barging past him , standing in the middle of the room , looking around for evidence of depravity . Jack , who was fully dressed by then , grabbed the man by the arm . " Who are you ? " he asked , pulling the man back toward the door . " Me , I am the owner . The landlord . Never mind that . Who are you ? I do n't allow this in my house . Mister , pack up . Now . You hear me ? "  | " In about one minute , unless you 're out of here , I 'm gon na tear your arm out of your shoulder , " said Jack calmly . " This is a private home and as such it is protected by the second , third , fourth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution . You heard about that ? " The landlord looked as if the wind had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jack . " No forced entry and no denial of due process . " As he pulled the landlord toward the door he saw Nora standing there in the hallway , smiling . " I tell my lawyer , " said the landlord , hurrying down the stairs . " I go to call him now . " Nora came in and closed and bolted the door . " I 'm afraid I 've caused you some trouble , " said Jack . She tossed him the car keys and smiled . " I liked the way you handled him , " she said . " He 'll not cause me any trouble . In any case , we have n't given him any cause , have we . " Jack blushed . " A technicality , " he said . " Easily fixed . " She came into his arms . He held her face and kissed her noisily on the mouth . She felt him rouse and then she groaned . They stumbled into the bedroom and became naked and kissed each other in long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a slow slide into each other  --  almost like a confirmation of their first impression . Later they dressed and then sat drinking tea , silent , each wrapped tight with private thoughts . " Do you work tonight ? " he asked . " I do , " she said . " Why so far away ? "  |p181She  shrugged . " It 's something to do with privacy , " she said , a little more harshly than she intended . He nodded . " I understand privacy , " he said . " Not that it means much to me . But it means a lot to some people , and I can respect that . " " That 's rare . Not many can . " He gathered his things and looked around . Collecting memories , she guessed . He thinks he wo n't see it again . " I 'm old , " she said when he stood by the door , ready to leave . He looked puzzled . She shook her head . " Not chronologically . But old . Older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my mornings quiet and I like to read in the evenings by myself . " " Are you driving me away , Nora ? " She smiled . " No , Jack Mann . I 'm laying down a road map . So you wo n't fall into a ditch . " He pulled her to him and kissed her . She held a hand against his face . It was a small gesture , huge with significance . And so they had spent the rest of the day.  |p182They  were waiting where they had been told to wait , on the northwest side of the street , facing Park Avenue and Sixtieth Street . Two good Irish Republican Army soldiers . " I believe that you 're expecting me , " said Michael , keeping them both in killing range just in case he 'd made a mistake , just in case that back-of-the-neck premonitionhe could n't shake was right and he 'd been followed . " I do n't know , " said the young one , the bright Mick with eyes like lit coals . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Michael , and he was surprised to hear a croak in his own voice . It had the sound of defeat , or at least resignation . They knew the signal , and he was relieved . It was n't a trap . Or at least not one that he had fallen into carelessly . It was still early enough , and he took the two soldiersp183for a walk through Manhattan , pointing out the sights possessively , like a loving tour guide . " New York is gettingready for Christmas , " he said , showing them the lights and trees and merry windows of Fifty-seventh Street . " Good Christ , it even makes Dublin look small , " commented the thick one , the one called Dan . " Dublin 's a little village compared to this . " " Dublin is small at Christmas , " said the quick one . " That 's because it 's Cat'lic . Small and sad . But Belfast t'rows a nice Christmas party . " " I 'll call you Mick , " Michael told the younger one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . You 're Mick to me . " They stopped in an Irish pub and had a beer . " Like piss , " said Dan . " So 's this pub , " said Mick . " Now , now , " said Michael . " A little thin , maybe . But this is America . " " In Dublin you can bite the ale , it 's so t'ick , " said Dan . " This tastes like pisswater . " " The difference is that in America people can afford to buy the damn ale , " replied Michael . " There 's the real difference . " The two exchanged looks . Michael could have felt the looks go back and forth even if he had n't been staring in their direction . As if to say , The old man has gone soft ; the old man has forgotten what it is like to hate . " Never mind , " said Michael , smiling . " Listen , Dan , go across the street . There 's a phone booth there . Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee is fine . " Dan nodded and knew enough not to ask what itp184meant . He understood that it had meaning and that was enough . " And , listen , Dan , while you 're at it , see if you notice a watcher . " Mick picked up his ears . " Is there someone on our ass ? " " Ca n't be too careful , " said Michael . A waitress came down from the dining room and asked if the " boys " would like anything from the kitchen , because they were about to run out of the house special . " And what would that be ? " asked the bright-eyed Mick . " A trencherman 's plate , " she said . " Is that with hairy bacon ? " asked Mick . " Because I like my bacon hairy . Reminds me of the old country . " " We wo n't be dining , " said Michael , subduing young Mick with a glance . " If you do n't mind me askin ' , how much time do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enough , " said Michael , looking at him coldly . For the first time Mick could see a long drop in Michael'seyes . " I did n't mean to be nosy , " he said quickly . Michael changed the subject . He wanted to know some details . They were staying in Queens , said Mick . Someone 's house . He shrugged . It was the way it worked on the other side . You moved into someone 's house  --  a stranger . They asked no questions . You offeredno explanations . You came and went and then one day you were gone . How the thing was arranged was someone else 's business . His job was mechanical . He planted bombs . He sprayed streets with automatic fire . He laid low.  | " How old are you ? " asked Michael . " Twenty , " shot back Mick . " I do n't expect to get much older . " " None of us will live to collect a pension , " said Michaelbitterly . Then Dan was back . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had rung off . " Did you see anyone ? " asked Michael . " Just a lot of Americans , " said Dan . " No watchers . " " Good , " said Michael . " Oh , she said one other t'ing , " said Dan . " She said , ' Luck . " It was the warning that they were being watched . That it was n't entirely safe . It was n't the alarm to call it off . Just the yellow caution light . Nora could be trusted . If she sensed something wrong , there was good cause for concern . Michael thought about it , but he had come too far to turn back now . The plane was already on the tarmac on the other side . It was under guard now , being searched and searched again for bombs . They had no idea that the danger came from an entirely different quarter . " Tomorrow night we make the practice run , " said Michael , and the other two exchanged excited looks . Barry waited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back door . His plan was to wait for his uncle on the usual approach road , flag down the Buick and warn him off . He had the gun inside his coat and the money stuffed into his pockets , along with a ham sandwich for emergencies . Outside , as he turned to make certain thep186door was locked , each of his arms was grabbed in a viselike clamp . " Barry ? How the hell are you ? " said one of the men behind the grip . Before he knew what was happening , they had stripped him of his gun and his money and even his ham sandwich . Then , as easily as if they had a key , they opened the locked door of his uncle 's house and took him inside . Seven men came in trailing . Serious-lookingmen with deep frowns . Standing back out of the way was Dino , looking a little out of his depth . " Dino ? " pleaded Barry . " Ca n't help you , pal . These guys are judgment day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit down , Barry , " said the obvious leader , a rough man with a battered face and a body as hard as stone . You could see it scrape against the fabric of the suit and shirt . The leader spoke gently , but it only made the force of his command more urgent . " Put the cuffs on him , " he told one of the henchmen . When the henchman opened his coat and took out the cuffs and Barry saw the belt and the holster , he knew that they were all cops . The henchman handcuffed Barry behind his back . There was a gentle knock on the door . Barry half hoped it was his uncle , although he did n't believe that anythingcould save him now . It was just the two men who had been parked out front . " One of youse guys stays in the car , " said the leader . " Right , Bobby . " " I want you should stay awake , too . " " Right . " The house was swarming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cushions and pullingapart cabinets.  |p187Bobby  pulled over a chair and turned it around and sat across from Barry , facing him , resting his hands on his chin on the back of the chair . " Listen , I know what you 're thinkin ' , " said Bobby . Barry could n't speak . " You 're thinkin ' that you 're a dead man . Am I right ? Tell me the truth , am I right ? " Barry smiled . He felt some relief . The man spoke as if to reassure him . And if he was right and they were cops , he was safe . Cops would only arrest him . They would n't execute him . And then he thought , what 's Dino doing with a squad of cops ? And as the thought struck him , so did Bobby 's fist . Straight in the face . It knocked out two front teeth and started a flow of blood from his broken nose . " You know , you could be right , " said Bobby , rubbing his fist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could be a dead man . " Barry was conscious for a few seconds , and then he passed out . Not for long . When he awoke he was still handcuffed and the two guards were propping him up . He tried to speak , but choked on a mouthful of blood . " See , Barry , you and I both know where that money came from , " said Bobby , bending in , sounding reasonable . " I mean , you had it in your possession and possessionis supposed to be nine-tenths of the earth 's surface , but you and I know it ai n't your money . " Barry managed to speak . " Could I call a lawyer ? " Bobby rolled his eyes . " Did you hear that ? Hey , Sonny , you catch that ? He wants a lawyer ! " Bobby shot out a left that snapped Barry 's head , closing an eye and restarting the flow of blood in and out of his head . The pain got really bad and he passed out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because hep188was spilling blood and bile all over the carpet . Barry worried that his uncle could be very upset . Then he thought that was stupid . " I 'm your lawyer , " said Bobby , smiling maliciously . " You can tell me anything . I promise . " Barry heaved again . The teams came back from the other parts of the house . " Nothing , " they reported , and one of the henchmensearched each member as they reported in . Barry was alarmed ; they trusted no one . " Get the car out of here , " he told Dino . " We do n't want it traced . " Dino took the keys and went out to the garage . Barry felt a curious abandonment . As if his last friend had left him . Bobby came back from the kitchen sucking on a can of beer . He nodded to one of the men , and they lifted Barry to his feet . Bobby turned and back-kicked Barry in the belly , emptying out the last dregs of his stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wet cloth and whispering in his ear . " It 's only gon na get worse . He 's gon na pound it outta ya . One way or another , you got ta tell us what you did with the money . " " Was your uncle in on this ? " asked Bobby almost gently . There was something in his arm . He did n't know what it was . Funny , he had n't eaten anything but his stomach bubbled with gas . His head was light . It was n't the beating . He knew that it was n't the beating . Then the pain in his arm rolled up and into his chest . Like a vise grip . He 'd never felt it before , but he knew what it was . And then Barry smiled . He did n't know why . He just did . And then he felt a terrible , clear pain all across his chest . And then he felt nothing.  |p189Bobby  was stunned . He saw the kid 's face turn pale and then purple . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone and died on the carpet of his uncle 's house . Lying in his own blood and vomit . No doubt . A coronary . He 'd seen enough of them . But a kid like this ... ? " Take the cuffs off , " he said . " Do we torch the house , Sarge ? " asked plainclothes detective Sonny Federicci , no longer careful about names and titles . " No , you asshole . The dough might still be here , " said Sergeant Frank Palleo  --  Bobby . " But we searched it good , " said Federicci . " We could have missed it , " said Sergeant Palleo . " No . We wait . Let the uncle come home . Maybe he 'll show us where it is . " Jack saw the cars parked out front . Then he saw the lights flickering upstairs and downstairs and he just kept going past the house . The lookouts across the street never even noticed him slow down , pick up speed and then go by . Jack turned two corners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks from his house . He backtracked on foot , making certain that he aroused no attention . He settled into a blind across a lawn from his house , shielded by bushes and a tree . He sat there and watched . And he checked his gun . Whoever they were , they were very careless . They parked where you could n't miss them . They ran lights like it was Christmas . Was it the mob out to reclaim their money ? He doubted it . The mob was more discreetwhen it came to setting up an ambush . More likely they were cops . All those nonchalant men behind thep190wheels of their showy cars , all that insouciant display of power ; he knew the signs . Had to be cops . " Fucking Barry , " he whispered out loud . Maybe they had even been listening when he called . Barry had sounded nervous . Still , you could n't blame him . You could n't hate him . Barry was not good under pressure . Barry was foolish . But he was not someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home in teams and pairs . He counted five . Finally there was only the car across the street with the two plainclothesmen drinking coffee . He did n't see Barry leave . Maybe they had brought him out earlier . When the house was dark and he had n't seen any movement or light for half an hour , Jack made his way to the basement window . He broke the glass with his scarf wrapped around his hand . He pulled the latch , then crawled in . He felt funny , breaking into his own home , but then maybe this was n't his home anymore . He could sense the strange presence . He could feel a difference . He thought that he would n't need a light , that he would know his way around by memory , but he kept stumbling and bumping into things . When he turned on his pencil flashlight , he saw what had been done to the interior . The living room was a riot of brokenand ripped furniture . They had been searching for the money , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chair . Then he saw the body . It was Barry . No doubt about that . He was lying in a puddle of his own spent life in the middle of the living room . No doubt that he was dead . The battered face and the open eyes and the stench of raw vomit and the excrement left no question about it.  | " Barry ! " he said , as much an apology as anything else . " Damn ! " Suddenly he sensed something else . He made his way to the closet , but all the blankets were shredded , as if they 'd suspected that he 'd sewn the money into the linings . Moving slowly , he managed to get near the door leading down to the basement . Then he lunged and stumbled down and up through the window he had used to get in and was out in the yard . By the time the police hiding in the house were able to get out of their own nests , Jack was gone . " Tell Ryan to stay on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the refrigerator door . " Orange Two , this is Base , stay on the subject leavingthe house , " said Detective Federicci into the radio . The radio crackled , but there was no answer . " Orange Two , Orange Two , this is Orange Base , do you copy ? " " Orange Base , this is Orange Two ; you 're breaking up , " said Plainclothes Officer Tommy Ryan , stationed one hundred feet away in the unmarked car . " Orange Two , Orange Two , stay on the subject fleeingthe goddamned house ! " shouted Sonny Federicci . " Do you fuckin ' copy ? " " Yeah , I copy , but what subject are we talking about ? " said Ryan . He was standing in the front door of the house , having given up on the radio . " Christ , he just ran outta here , " said Bobby Palleo . " Did n't you assholes see him ? " " We did n't see no one , Sarge . " " Should we seal off the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shot back Bobby . " You want BoroughCommand to start getting curious ? "  | " Sorry , Sarge . " " Where the fuck is your brain ? " They ran out , looking to see which way Jack had run , looking for fresh tracks . But all they saw was a few blinds going up and then down . Bobby told Sonny to torch the house . Discreetly . Jack was hiding behind a tree near the garage when he saw the detective go into his home . He heard a crack , and in a moment he saw the smoke and flames . Poor Barry , he thought . One more insult . There were things inside the house that he would have saved  --  pictures of Natalie , old letters . Then he thought , Fuck it . This was a rough game and he 'd betterstart acting like a player.  |p193The  apartment building was old , built in the twenties when they put in long , lavish lobbies without calculating the square-foot cost , back at a time when doormen wore wing collars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the fringe of the expensive area , the part known as the Heights . The tenants still called it Brooklyn Heights , but that was a conceit . The building was in downtown Brooklyn . The landlord , a skinflint , liked to point out to prospectivetenants that it was a " classy " building ; it even had a doorman . But the doorman was a lush who had been glued together strictly for the sake of appearances . Minimum wage and minimum effort . The doorman could barely manage to stay awake , much less climb into a uniform . He usually showed up for work  --  when he did show up for work  --  in a plaid shirt sour with thep194stink of liquor . Still , the landlord could say with some technical justification that he had a doorman , and boost the rent as if he were still employing a Romanov . Jack waited across the street until someone went in , then trailed behind like a pilot fish . The doorman was suffering either in anticipation of a drunk or the aftermathof one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack marched through his checkpoint . And the tenants did n't care because Jack was white and looked reasonably respectable . Mo was married to a woman named Christine , a Catholic who was convinced that she was going to hell for marrying a Jew . Jack 's wife had been Jewish and , Jack himself being a lapsed Catholic , the tangle of religionbecame a running joke among the four of them . It seemed to ease the embarrassment of the mixed grouping . Always , Christine regarded the sight of Jack ( a fellowapostate ) as some kind of absolution  --  a forgiving and comforting presence . She came to the door in her dressing gown , peered through the peephole and let Jack in . " Mo did n't tell me you were coming over ! " " Is he home ? " " Just gone down to the store . He 'll be back in a minute . Just enough time to get him jealous . " " I need a drink , " said Jack , collapsing into a sofa . She looked at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey and waited silently for Mo . Finally , they heard the key in the lock . " There he is , " Christine said with obvious relief . She rushed to the door . " Jack 's here , " she told her husband . " Is he dressed ? " quipped Mo . " Or it 's just you running around naked ? "  |p195Christine  pouted and left them alone in the den with an open bottle and a couple of glasses . Jack waited until she was well away . " I 'm in big trouble , " he said . Mo lit a cheap cigar , nodded and asked , " What kind of trouble ? " " It 's complicated . I 'm not sure . I think there may be a warrant out for me . " " Why ? What for ? You did n't pay your parking tickets , or what ? " Jack looked over at his old friend . " It 's serious , " he said . " I can see , " said Mo . " What can I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long sigh . He looked around . A nice room . Warm . A cozy little den with wood paneling , something that he could never manage to put together . He was always leaking papers , leaving half-read books scattered over surfaces , forgetting cups of coffee , spilling crumbs . Of course , Mo had a talent for neatness and order . It was what made him a good cop . He kept his desk neat and he kept his files up-to-date and everyone under his control behaving nicely . The glass was empty again and Jack filled it up . Mo 's face showed a frown of concern . " Do n't be my mother , " said Jack . " You do n't usually drink like you 're trying to drown , " said Mo . " You Jews ! You think that liquor is some kind of toxic waste ! " " It is . " " Not always . Sometimes it 's medicinal . " " So is radiation . Does n't mean you should go out of your way . "  |p196Jack  leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend 's knee . " Mo , listen , I 'm in trouble . " " You wan na tell me about it or you wan na sit here and get shitfaced ? " " Both , I guess . " " Tell me , Jack . " Jack sighed and his shoulders sagged and he clutched back a sob . " Barry 's dead , " he said . Mo fell back in his chair , and his face drained of color . The half tolerant , half provoking smile vanished . Then he recovered , became the solid policeman , the sturdy partner , the reliable shoulder for his friend . " What happened ? " he asked . Jack shook his head . He swallowed some tears . " I really do n't know , " he said . " I came home , he was dead . " " Was he dealing ? " " No . I 'm sure he was n't dealing . " Mo stood up and walked around the room . " Listen , " he said , " remember 1967 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York City Patrolman Moses Berger joined the Israeli Defense Force . He took a plane and told the authorities in Tel Aviv his background , and they signed him up . Mo had been a tank commander in the American army in Vietnam , and his services were welcome . The problem was that such services were against American law , and Mo would lose his job and his pension if it came out . So Jack covered up for him . When Mo was wounded on the Golan Heights , Jack made certain he got home without attracting attention . He checked him into NYU Medical Center , where they treated his burns and his shrapnel wounds  --  recorded as treatment following ap197car accident . They would joke later that it was the only known case of shrapnel injuries resulting from a car accident . " Vehicle , " said Jack . " Technically , vehicle was correct . " Jack got a friend with diplomatic connections to create false documents , and Mo 's job and pension were saved . It was not a small favor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . When Mo had tried to express his gratitude , Jack waved him off . " That 's what partners do , " he had said , ending the discussion . " Yeah , " said Jack now , " I remember 1967 . I bought a new Buick . So what ? " Mo smiled . " Tell me what you can tell me . " Jack shook his head . " I ca n't tell you much . I came home and I saw cops all over my house . I hid in the bushes and I waited until I thought they were gone and then I went inside . That 's when I found Barry . " " Oh , boy ! " " Somebody did a real job on him . The kid 's face was all punched in . " " What did you do ? " " I snuck out . They were waiting for me . " " They were waiting for you ? " " I saw them burn down the house . Some plainclothes fuck set off a thermit charge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cops ? " Jack nodded . " I know a couple . Citywide anticrime . Cops . " " You 're not telling me everything . " " I ca n't . I really ca n't . " Mo was quiet , sucking on his cheap cigar . " You want me to go down and check out the computer ? You want I should find out what 's cooking inside the Atex ? " " If it 's not too much trouble . "  |p198Mo  nodded . " Okay . Did you eat ? Are you hungry ? " " I 'm not hungry . " Mo put on his jacket . " I 'll tell Chris not to bother you . " Then he stopped at the door . " Listen , Jack , if you need me , I 'm still good on the street . " " I know . " " You need backup , someone to watch your ass , someone to run an errand . You need something . " " I know . " The lieutenant on duty at Borough Command in Queens was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night off ? " " I forgot something ; left my wife 's anniversary gift here , " said Mo . " I thought your anniversary was in September . " " I 'm a little late . " The lieutenant was a man without any sense of humor . He looked puzzled , but he was too busy prowlingthe aisles , annoyed at the idle chatter of the night crew on the computers , to dwell on Mo 's presence . To Lieutenant Kevin McElvy the men were like lazy cattle , grazing in tall grass , not earning their paychecks . Not that there was anything to do . But the lieutenant wanted to see the men busy . IDLE HANDS ARE THE DEVIL 'S WORKSHOP , said the plaque on his desk . " Hey , Loo , we 're sending out for pizza ; you want in ? " That was just like them , he thought furiously , eating pizza and drinking beer when they should be working ! " No ! " he snarled . " Okay , but it 's Joey Maleno Pizza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to like to annoy Lieu/tenant McElvy . " Hey , Mo , you want a couple of slices ? " " Nah , thanks anyway ; I got ta get home , " said Mo . " It 's my anniversary . " " Yeah , no shit ? I did n't think Jews celebrated anniversaries , " said the young cop . " We do , " replied Mo . " We have the traditional feast in which we cook the firstborn son of a young Christian colleague . " The baby-faced cop  --  whose wife had just given birth to a son  --  blinked in shock . " Hey ! That ai n't funny ! " " How would you know , asshole ? " said Richard Deitz , another old cop farmed out to work night computers . " Okay , okay , " broke in Lieutenant McElvy , who saw in the nasty exchange the living proof , actual evidence , to support the wisdom written on his plaque . " Let 's get some work done . Berger , if you came in here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my crew . " Mo ignored him , sat down at the computer terminal , opened a few drawers , then logged into the mainframe computer . He punched up the warrants outstanding file and was relieved when Jack 's name was n't there . He punched up fire department runs and read the details of the fire . Then he punched up the material about the airport robbery . Jack and Chris were playing gin rummy when Mo returned . Mo looked haggard and motioned Chris out of the room , then took a reviving slug of whiskey . " That was some fire they started at your house , " he said . " Still going . "  |p200Jack  blinked . He did n't know what to say . " They found the body . " Jack nodded . He noticed the dust floating in the light , suspended in the air , like his own life . " So far no identification . " " It 's Barry , " pronounced Jack . He felt a steep slide of emotion as he uttered his dead nephew 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time he 'd felt it . How did Barry die ? Did cops actually beat him to death ? He found that hard to believe . " There 's no warrant out on you , " said Mo . Jack sat up straight . How could that be ? He 'd seen them . They were cops . He was positive . Not a doubt . He 'd recognized at least two of them . Anticrime cops . Routine procedure was to put out a warrant when you were after someone . And they had to be after him . And if they were hunting for Jack , where was the warrant ? Unless .. . " You wan na tell me about it ? " asked Mo . Jack did n't hear him . He was too busy turning over the gears of this new information . Cops . Cops for certain . Cops who burned down his house . Cops who probably murdered his nephew . At first he thought that they 'd stumbled onto the dead body and that the arson was harmless . But not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under orders to maintain secrecy . One thing was certain : somehow , although he did n't know how , this was connected to the robbery at the airport . " What did you find out ? " he asked . " About the other business  --  the airport ? " Mo reached into his pocket as if he were pulling out a fifty-pound weight . " I told you to stay away from this , " he said . " This is a can of worms . "  | " I remember , " said Jack . " Objection noted . " Mo sighed and put on his glasses and looked at the piece of paper . " Irish , " he said . " Irish ? " " Like , from Ireland . The two dead stickupmen at the airport were soldiers in the Provisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army . Here on a job , according to In-telligence . " " Why would they pull a common stickup ? I mean , if they 're IRA soldiers , why would they stoop to that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought that was how they operated . Pull a job , finance an operation , keep going . Is n't that how it works ? " " Not an ideal method . If they were here on an operation , they should have laid low . Get their money in some regular way so they do n't put themselves at risk . Save the risks for the operation . Now they 're exposed . " " Well , we do have some other parties interested . " " Like who ? " " Like the State Department ; the FBI ; CIA ; Interpol ; Royal Ulster Constabulary , Special Branch , " ticked off Mo . " Like I said , a real can of worms . " Jack nodded . " I 'm grateful for the help . " " I owe you . " Jack began to get up . " Mo , where do these people operate ? I mean , where is their territory ? You know , like the German-American Bund had nests in Yorkville during World War Two . Where would the IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd find someone under his couch . " All over , " he said . " There are rough pockets up in Inwood . Where they play soccer . All over . " " Queens , too ? "  | " Oh , sure , Queens . Very big in Queens . Far Rockaway . Lots of pubs along the boulevard . " Thursday , November 5 , 3:45 A.M. , 78 Hours and CountingBy now Jack was beginning to wonder about Nora . After that first night , when he slept over , he had found her whispering on the phone when he came out of the toilet . She had had that brittle smile  --  a child caught in the act  --  when he gave her a quizzical look . He had thought nothing of it then . Just something you came across when you broke into someone 's life . She could have been juggling boyfriends . Gossiping about him with a friend . Or was it something darker ? . He sat in the car across from the bus stop and waited for Nora to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened to Barry , everything took a sinister turn , everything seemed shaded and heavy with implications . He looked around and saw no one else waiting in the shadows . Maybe he was being paranoid . Maybe . But the longer he sat there , waiting for her to come home from the Shebeen , the more certain he was that her appearance in his life and her connection with the bar was not a coincidence . She was guarded , silent , withholding details about herself . Of course , Irish girls were like that . But this one was past that natural reticence . The soft affection she had showed him in the night was a slip , atypical , not the iron core . " Nora ! " he called when she stepped off the bus . She froze and twisted and seemed to bend into ap203crouch , ready to strike out . Then she saw him standing under the street lamp , recognized him , and she stood up straight . It took her a moment to smile . As if she had to weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said coldly . " I 'm in trouble . " She looked around . " Let 's not stand here then , " she said , pulling him along to her apartment . He felt something protective about her . They moved silently and quickly through the streets . There was no breath wasted in talk . Past the locks and into the apartment ; she put the kettle on , then sat across from him . " My nephew Barry 's been killed , " he said . " Oh , Mother of God ! " she said . He watched her , looking for something to betray her , but she seemed genuinely shocked . She took him into her arms and comforted him , and he allowed himself to rest for a while . " There 's a spot , you know , in the west of Ireland , " she cooed in her lullaby voice , as he lay half asleep and half awake . " It 's outside of Galway on the coast  --  the place Yeats described as having a terrible beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no war and no rebellion and the Troubles are held at bay . You can sit in a pub and look across at the island of Aran and not get blown up and not get shot . I 've thought about making a home there , near the colleges and the coast , lappingup the sanctuary . " Jack was by now asleep and thought that he dreamed it all.  |p204He  awoke to the sound of the kettle . Nora was wrapped in a towel , fresh from the shower , and singing softly under her breath , plucking fresh underwear out of her drawer . " I guess we overslept , " he said , smiling . She turned to face him , and he was shocked by the transformation . She was radiant . She closed the drawer and came over to the bed and bent down and kissed him . " I wanted to let you sleep , " she said . He yawned and she slipped into his outstretched arms . They lay like that for a while , not speaking , hardly breathing , feeling a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift of position , like a cat nuzzling closer  --  but he felt her breasts flicker against him and he was stirred . " Nora , " he said , and she lookedp205up from the nest of his arms and he bent to kiss her . " Oh , Lord , " she moaned and pressed in and reached up and pulled him closer . " Nora , " he repeated in that deep-throated voice of passion , and his hands unfolded the towel and she shifted to make it easier . She pulled away his blanket and they both stared at each other . They were white and trembling , as if the long abstinence was a shadow that kept them pale and nervous . Later , when they were drowsy and content , the phone rang and she wrapped herself in her towel and in her secrets to answer it . She listened , her back turned to Jack , and made single sounds in response to the party on the other end . " Yes . Fine . I understand . " Then she took her underwear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call had envelopedher in modesty and stealth . " Will you be at the bar tonight ? " he asked . " I will , " she said . He dressed quickly and burned his tongue on the hot tea . She was in a hurry . He could tell . But he did n't feel jealous . Whatever errand she had to run was no emotional threat . It was something far more dangerous . Thursday , November 5 , 8:45 P.M. , 61 Hours and CountingThey took the subway out to Queens and bought cold cuts and bread and soda in a delicatessen and retrievedthe pickup truck from the locked garage in Flushing . Then they drove out to Long Island , eatingp206along the way . Michael read the map and picked out the landmarks . Twice they got lost , and twice he found the way back . Soon they were glimpsing signs and smelling the ocean . " The water 's choppy , " noted Dan as they rode along the shore out . past Amagansett . " It wo n't be so bad out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked for them on the map . " Rich bastards , " muttered Mick . " Without the rich bastards we 'd be using a slingshot , " replied Michael . He did n't know why he was so cantankerous with these two . They were soldiers doing their duty . Maybe it was just the fact that he did n't like working in a group . He looked around the house . It had huge glass windows and sun decks and a counter that ran like the deck of an aircraft carrier along the wall of the kitchen . There was a barbecue out back . It must be nice during the summer , he thought . To sit on the sun deck and get fat . . . Then he pushed away the thoughts of pleasure . There was a changing room and steps leading down to the beach . You could n't tell if it was raining or if the wind was whipping up the surf . They were in their wet suits and heavily laden . They carried weapons and ammunitionand a deflated rubber boat . Michael also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed Michael . " In case we have to fight our way out . " They swam out deep , lugging the equipment behind with a rope . At a signal they dove and made the last few hundred yards underwater . It was a struggle with the air compressor . Finally , Michael hooked it up and turned it on , and the compressed air made the rubberp207boat unmanageable . It leaped up out of their hands , shot up out of the water like a submarine blowing its tanks . On the surface , Michael pulled the boat to him . " We 'll try it again , " he shouted , and the other two nodded . They were experienced divers . It took a while to deflate the boat , but they finally got enough air out to make it sink again . It was difficult work , and Michael was breathing hard as he struggled to attach the air valve again . The other two were also breathing hard , he noted with satisfaction . Dan held the boat steady and used his weight to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to come in and wrestle with the leaping rubberboat as well . Finally , at a signal from Michael , they turned it loose and it shot to the surface . Michael was quick , right behind it , lugging the rest of the equipment in a waterproofsack . It took two heaves to get it into the boat , and then he climbed in afterward . Mick was on the other side of the boat , tearing away the waterproofing from the weapons . He had the rifle out , and Michael had the rocket half undone . " You stay in the water and steady the boat , " shouted Michael , and Dan nodded . Good lad . They were both good lads in a fight , he could tell . Mick was down in the boat , the rifle cradled in his arms , ready for action . Less than three minutes since the boat hit the surface . Michael was attaching the wires and loops and steadying the rocket on his shoulder . He checked the sky to make certain it was clear . He checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the rocket would n't be noticed . Then he sighted on a cloud and launched the heat-seeking missile . The boat rocked unsteadily , but the thing worked !  |p208The  rocket went out over the Atlantic and finally ran out of fuel before it found anything hot enough to home in on . It fell harmlessly into the ocean . If anyone saw it , they would wish on it , thinking it a shooting star . Michael stood there for a moment , rocking with the motion of the boat , enjoying the triumph . The plan would work . He would have to fine-tune it a little . He 'd thought of some changes already . But he was burning with the knowledge that it was possible . It would work ! He nodded to Mick , who let off a few rounds to see how the boat would handle the kick of the automatic rifle . Then they wrapped the weapons back in the waterproofbags and eased back into the water . Michael pulled out his knife and tore apart the rubber boat . The rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He cried out , " Christ Al-mighty ! " The other two smiled . They were witnessing the joy of Michael , the legend . " It 's Jack ! " bellowed Tom Fiske , who was back to being a writer . Liam was behind the bar . Then , turning to the bar , Fiske cried , " Liam , give my friend here whatever will lubricate his throat  --  this man 's a great high tenor when it comes to wit . " Nora had a slight shock when Jack pushed his way into the Shebeen . It was something that she saw in his face . Something hard . A certain set look of utter determination , an expression not unknown to her . And then she realized that she did n't know much about the man . Not much more than his name , if that was his name . For all she knew , he could be working with Michael . A whisper of caution crept into her greeting . " How are you tonight ? " she said crisply.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
