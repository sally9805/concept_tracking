Besides garbage , they found how-to instructions for making rocket nozzles , papers with Scud B , Sparrow , and other missile names doodled on them , and shopping lists for rocket-propellant chemicals. // Customs agents also watched as Mr. Helmy traveled to Washington , D.C. , with an Egyptian diplomat and two boxes suspected to contain carbon nozzle material . The agents personally delivered to his door a ceramic nose cone-shaped device ordered from a North Carolina company . In June , they arrested Helmy , a US citizen born in Egypt , and accused him of conspiring to smuggle sensitive missile components to his native land. // // Helmy now says the Egyptian defense minister asked him for the parts and assured him that the US government did not mind . Helmy ' s trial is scheduled to begin in August . Whatever its outcome , the case highlights a growing US law-enforcement problem : espionage involving long-range ballistic missiles. // Besides the Helmy prosecution , Customs is investigating at least two other significant cases involving ballistic-missile technology , according to US officials . As these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details. // Ammonium perchlorate ( AP ) , an important ingredient in solid rocket fuel , may be one of the items involved . An explosion leveled an AP factory in Nevada last year and tightened world supplies , perhaps forcing developing nations seeking the chemical onto the arms black market . ' ' Producers just can ' t keep up right now , ' ' one official says. // Export of Western technology useful in ballistic missiles is currently regulated under an agreement reached in 1987 by the US and a number of its allies . But evidence of technology smuggling , including reports that West German and Italian companies have aided missile projects in developing nations , is causing some members of Congress to push for tighter restrictions. // One proposal , by Rep. Howard Berman ( D ) of California , would require that US economic sanctions be slapped on companies domestic or foreign found helping developing nations acquire ballistic missile capability . Another , by Sen. Dennis DeConcini ( D ) of Arizona , calls on Secretary of State James Baker III to name a special missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does need to pay more attention to this , ' ' says a congressional aide who works on the issue. // Clearly the proliferation of ballistic missiles is becoming a problem on the order of the spreading use of poison gas . William Webster , director of the Central Intelligence Agency , said in recent congressional testimony that by the year 2000 at least 15 developing countries will be making their own ballistic missiles. // Countries that have or will have ballistic missiles include Israel , Egypt , Iraq , Syria , Iran , and Libya , according to the CIA . Other nations that could soon join the list include Brazil , Taiwan , and North and South Korea. // Ballistic missiles are generally defined as projectiles capable of carrying an 1 , 100-pound load about 190 miles . Nations that have them can fire large warheads deep into one anothers ' territory with assurance that defenses can not stop the attack . In geopolitics , such a weapon represents swaggering macho power . ' ' Ballistic missiles convey important new political and military status to those who acquire them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destruction such weapons can rain on civilian populations was thoroughly demonstrated by the salvos loosed at each other by Iran and Iraq in the Gulf War . During the eight-year course of the conflict these nations fired an estimated 1 , 000 ballistic missiles at each other , many of them Soviet Scud-B missiles juiced-up for longer range. // Intelligence analysts are concerned that developing nations will eventually strap chemical or even nuclear warheads onto their missile delivery systems , turning themselves into instant regional superpowers . A recent Congressional Research Service report says that some US military forces overseas are already within the range of new missile forces , and that ' ' even the continental United States will probably be within range of ballistic missiles from a few additional countries before the year 2000. ' ' // The Missile Technology Control Regime is the West ' s attempt to slow down the spread of these weapons worldwide . Signed in April 1987 by the US , Canada , West Germany , France , Italy , Japan , and Britain , it calls upon each government to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockets and rocket technology . Among covered items : // *Ceramic or carbon heat shields that protect warheads as they reenter the atmosphere. // *High-power rocket engines , both liquid- and solid-fueled. // *Chemicals used in propellents , such as ammonium perchlorate and aluminum powder. // *Machines capable of making missile parts , such as special filament-winding equipment used in casing manufacture. // Carbon-fiber material is the technology at particular issue in the Abdelkader Helmy case . Helmy , his wife , a US confederate named James Huffman , and an Egyptian diplomat were detained last June as a box containing carbon fiber was about to be loaded onto an Egyptian C-130 military aircraft at Baltimore-Washington International Airport . The Egyptian was later released because of his diplomatic immunity. // Marcus Topel , Helmy ' s lawyer , does not deny that his client was involved in obtaining missile technology for Egypt . But he says that Egyptian Defense Minister Abu Ghazala recruited Helmy , a missile engineer at Aerojet General , and that Egypt is now trying to make him a fall guy. // Reportedly , numerous references to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized as part of the Helmy probe. // Egypt is said to be cooperating with the US probe . President Hosni Mubarak said he believes Egyptian officials are guilty at most of procedural errors. // US officials say that Egypt , Argentina , and Iraq are working on a joint missile called ' ' Condor . ' ' The technology obtained by Helmy may have been intended for this project . Seth Carus , a missile expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , says Helmy was obtaining late 1980s technology that may also have been useful for a more sophisticated follow-on to the Condor. // Besides carbon material , a nose cone , and propellant ingredients , Helmy obtained or tried to obtain special-strength steel and rocket telemetry antennas , according to court documents filed in the case. // Prosecutors charge that Helmy was paid more than $1 million last year for his services . At one point , according to the affidavit , a wiretap picked up Helmy complaining to an Egyptian diplomat that someone in Washington was talking too much and was going to get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be exported outside the US , ' ' the affidavit quotes Helmy as saying . ' ' If they knew that I am buying it to export it , I ' d be thrown in jail. ' ' // //
