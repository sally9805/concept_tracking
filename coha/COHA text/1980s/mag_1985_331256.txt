You do n't get to be the most powerful boy in Hollywood without being a man of many faces . There is Steven Spielberg the Good : he directs terrific pictures with sentiment and smarts . There is Steven the Strong : he godfathers Spielberg-style films that soar ( Back to the Future ) more often than they flop ( Young Sherlock Holmes ) . But from the geriatric elite of Hollywood , Spielberg got no respect  --  no Oscars , that is . So here comes Steven the Nice , with his first " respectable " motion picture , an adaptation of Alice Walker 's Pulitzer-prizewinning novel The Color Purple . It bears the same relation to his more personal films that The 1986 Alice Walker Calendar , now on sale in bookstores , bears to the powerful fable that made her famous : a lavishly illustrated , well-intended , self-inflicted knockoff . <P> The Color Purple is an epistolary novel : a child 's letters to God , written by Celie , a poor black girl in early-20th century Georgia . Celie 's story is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of emotional regeneration , at the caressing hands of black women . The demotic narrative style , filled with humor , horror and the obsession to survive , softens Walker 's messages : Sisterlove is beautiful , and Men stink . We are inside Celie 's head , and for all the tragedies stored there , it is a lovely place to live . It might also seem the perfect spot for Spielberg to visit , since virtually all of his films are about the separation and cathartic reunion of parent and child . The book is full of such wrenching restorations , and for the climax of his movie Spielberg invents one more . <P> The whole picture is like that : too much of a noble thing . Spielberg has chosen to elegize the story by romanticizing it , swathing the characters in Norman Rockwell attitudes , a meddlesome symphonic score , and a golden fairy dust that shines through the windows like God 's blessing . For every scene of raw artistry  --  as when young Celie 's brutal husband " Mr. " tears her away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seem photographed by Rainbow Brite for Hovel Beautiful . The book 's famous lesbian encounter between Celie and the charismatic blues singer Shug is played as if it were a sweet game a mother would teach her adoring child . Male violence is less sexual than paternal . Passion is wanting throughout , and a radiance that emanates from something other than a klieg light . It 's all very pretty , but it 's cinematography , not cinema . <P> No filmmaker as gifted as Spielberg can cow or neuter his talent forever . The Color Purple is speckled with epiphanies , especially in a flash of crosscutting that magically transplants an African plain , where Nettie has gone as a missionary , behind a Georgia bush ; Celie looks up from her hymnal and  --  wham !  --  a bulldozer crashes through the chancel of Nettie 's church thousands of miles away . None of this bravura , though , has liberated the attractive cast . Whoopi Goldberg suffers knowingly as Celie ; Danny Glover , as " Mr. , " looks vainly for a note to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Everyone seems reluctant to let loose here , taking a cue from their too reverent boss . Perhaps The Color Purple demanded a cannier , more daring director : Steven Spielberg . The Good .
