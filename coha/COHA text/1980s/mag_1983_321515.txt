Acostlyclash with Syria stirs rising concern in the U.S. over its Middle East role <P> The 28 U.S. Navy planes that attacked Syrian positions in Lebanon early Fast week were meant to send a message to the government of President Hafez Assad : for every Syrian strike against American forces , such as the previous day 's firing on U.S. reconnaissance planes , expect a strike in return . Unfortunately , delivering the message proved costly : two planes lost , one pilot killed , one captured , a Lebanese woman dead in the crash of one of the fighter-bombers . The air attack also sent a number of unintended messages . It told the Lebanese that the U.S. armed forces are neither invincible nor invulnerable . It told the Israelis that the newly revived concept of " strategic cooperation " between Washington and Jerusalem means that Israel should stay in Lebanon and help the U.S. fight Syria . It told the American people and their Congress that , whatever the U.S. role in Lebanon may be , the safety of American fighting men there must be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration that its Middle East policy may need some serious rethinking . Finally , it told the world that in any kind of Middle East peace negotiations , Syria simply can not be ignored ( see those story ) . <P> <P> The week was a nine-ring circus of death and despair . After Sunday 's raid came an intensive artillery barrage by Syrian-backed Druze militiamen , resulting in the death of eight U.S. Marines near Beirut International Airport . In Beirut itself , a car bomb exploded in a crowded street , killing 14 people . Nobody was apprehended , and as usual , the list of suspects was endless . Next day a terrorist bomb exploded on a crowded bus in Jerusalem , killing five Israelis and wounding 45 others . For this senseless slaughter , two warring branches of the Palestine Liberation Organization , including the mainstream group led by Chairman Yasser Arafat , claimed responsibility . A day later , Arafat 's group admitted making the attack but said it had made a mistake and hit the wrong bus . The recantation came too late . Presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelled Arafat 's redoubt at the northern Lebanese port city of Tripoli , from which the P.L.O . chairman was trying to arrange an exit for himself and the dwindling forces still loyal to him . <P> No less disturbing were the political and diplomatic questions raised by the latest events . The Lebanese , inured as they are to the endless fighting , showed few signs of being able to achieve any sort of national reconciliation . <P> The Syrians , despite the widely reported but still unexplained illness of President Assad , were determinedly pursuing their objectives in Lebanon and openly boasting about their military prowess in the face of the U.S. air attack . The Egyptians , whose peace treaty with Israel , orchestrated by the U.S. at Camp David , ranks as the most significant diplomatic achievement in the Middle East during the past decade , were publicly expressing shock over Washington 's newly proclaimed alignment with Israel . In France , Italy and Britain , critics of those countries ' commitments to the MultiNational Force in Lebanon were urging a pullout , though all three U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least for the time being .
