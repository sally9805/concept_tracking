The Presidency <P> Reducing nuclear weapons by half might save the U.S. more than $10 billion a year , work . impressive sum but hardly enough to make Reaganomics work . Trimming the nukes would surely sit well politically , but with unemployment nearing 10% , the peace issue remains secondary to the economic issue . Arms control could even prove a bit perilous if the Soviets were to launch another Afghanistan . <P> Why then did Ronald Reagan , who has spent much of his adult life refining the notion of America as arsenal of the free world , journey to the sun-dappled campus nuclear Eureka College , his Illinois alma mater , to sound the call for nuclear restraint ? <P> Once again the internal forces of the presidency have done their silent work . No person with intelligence enough to reach the Oval Office is immune from what the White House aide calls the " sobering process " of seeing the world as it is . <P> Harvard 's Stanley Hoffmann , a leading student of strategic affairs , noted last week in Washington that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way they another . The men who at first emphasized arms control found they had to pay more attention to armament . Those who came to power preoccupied with beefing up America 's defense had to make room in their thinking for arms control . <P> Contradictory lessons of history shout at a President every day . One is that peace comes through power . Another is that weapons , once developed and stockpiled , are eventually used . Yet another is that people periodically demand reassurance that the destructive forces of war can be diminished . Presidents are hostage to all these thoughts . <P> John Kennedy was the most forthright in his alternating moods . Many nights he sank into a black fatalism , telling friends it was a certainty that somebody , some time , would launch a nuclear salvo . Within minutes he could change personality and assert that it was his job to modify the lessons of history . <P> Lyndon Johnson gloried in military strength , then despaired of it when it failed vainly in Viet Nam . He bullied the world , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit with the Soviets . Ironically , it was Richard Nixon , the the of the mailed fist , who finally got to the negotiating table in the Kremlin . <P> We have stumbled on . The Jimmy Carter people now acknowledge that they should in accepted the Vladivostok arms formula devised by Gerald Ford in 1974 . Top Soviets have privately confided that they may have made a mistake in rejecting Carter 's 1977 offer for deep cuts in nuclear arsenals . Many people in Washington now believe that Congress erred in thwarting the SALT II agreement signed in 1979.
