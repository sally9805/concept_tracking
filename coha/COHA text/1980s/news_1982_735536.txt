txt Lawyers , says Steven Barkin , are n't very good businessmen . " A little better than doctors , but not much better . " That 's one reason he and several thousand other lawyers around the country occupy- " Fegen suites , " which are offices leased under a plan developed in the 1960s by a Beverly Hills attorney named Paul Fegen . Tenants dealing with Mr. Fegen ( pronounced Fee-jun ) pay a modest rent and get the services of a law library , telephone operator and receptionist along with an elegantly appointed space for impressing clients . Mr. Fegen also is supposed to take care of office-management tasks . Suddenly , however , all those suite arrangements have turned sour for the lawyers . Late last month , Mr. Fegen 's company , Attorneys Office Management Inc. , filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , saying it had current liabilities of $37.4 million and current assets of only $329.438 . Under Chapter 11 , a company continues to operate but has court protection from creditors while it attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company had been bubbling over with optimism , telling tenants through its slick monthly publication , " Suite News , " of a " vital and dynamic campaign to improve and expand our product . " Tenants in Limbo The company says it has 6,000 or so tenants  --  about a third of them in California , with concentrations in other cities such as Philadelphia , Miami and Houston . The bankruptcy filing puts them in limbo , unsure even whether to pay their rents , or to whom . Mr. Fegen , a man so promotion-minded that he once invited 1,400 people to a posh hotel ballroom to watch him get his flowing hair and beard shorn , is n't talking to reporters now . ( His beard has grown full and his hair is long again . ) But . talks with other principals in the bankruptcy proceedings indicate that it was a promotional and expansionist business plan that got his company in trouble . " His concept was sound , " says Clifford Brown , who is representing Mr. Fegen 's company in the bankruptcy proceedings . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he received huge concessions from building owners delighted to lease a whole floor or two in one swoop and let someone else find the dozens of tenants . Mr. Fegen got months of " free rent " ? actually periods when rent was deferred for a year or so and then amortized over the 20-year or 30-year term of his lease . He was then able to offer a discounted rent to at- tract his ideal tenant : the small-practice lawyer starting out on a budget . For years , the approach apparently brought Mr. Fegen , whose secretary describes him as " late-40-ish , " enough wealth to indulge his eccentricities . At one time he was known about town for driving down Wilshire Boulevard . hailing women through loudspeakers on the grille of his Excalibur automobile and asking them for their names and phone numbers . Mr. Brown says the cash crunch came because of an untimely doubling of the company 's lease commitments in the last few years , to 136 office building floors totaling 6.2 million square feet in 26 states . Mr. Fegen had trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office rental marPaul Fegen ket softened ; the nationwide office vacancy rate ' recently has risen to nearly 9% from 3.4% in March 1980 . With more space available , prices have fallen . Mr. Fegen , who was locked into leasing arrangements made when space was scarce , could n't sublease the space at the price he had to pay . Eugene Gratz , a California attorney who has talked to more than 100 tenants and plans to represent them as a class during the.bankruptcy proeedings , says the recession contributed to Mr. Fegen 's trouble . by lessening the number of lawyers needing office space . Many attorneys who might have gone into solo practice have stayed with their secure jobs instead , he says . " I would think long and hard before going out on my own , " says Mr. Gratz , who does n't operate out of a Fegen suite . The Fegen business .

A few months ago . Mr. Fegen brought in some new managers who recommended that rents be raised . A notice went out to Fegen suite occupants on Sept. 10 stating that " our quality office space and services were being marketed in some instances at far below market value , and in other locations even below our actual cost for raw space . " Some tenants were told their rent would be at least doubled . The recommendations of the managers came too late . By its own account , the company already had 2.8 million square feet of office space occupied by Fegen tenants and was committed for leases on another 3.4 million square feet in the next three years . When tallying its liabilities in the bankruptcy petition , Attorneys Office Management reported $27.5 million in future payments due landlords , and S4.8 million in serunty deposits refundable to tenants . In addition to its 8329.438 in current assets , the company listed $52.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leasehold interests . In the last months before filing for Chapter 11 , the company tried some cash-production tactics , such as offering two months of free rent to tenants who paid 10 months of rent in advance . As it turned out , those measures only locked up more tenant money in the uncertainty of the bankruptcy proceedings . Eviction Notices Some tenants received " quit or pay rent " eviction notices , although the notices are moot until the bankruptcy proceedings are resolved . The company 's current Chapter 11 plan apparently is to try to save the solid older leases , doubtless with steep rent boosts for tenants . Much of the expansion of the past few years , however , probably will be cancelled . Mr. Barkin and most othr Fegen-suite attorneys do n't seem worried about eviction : in the soft market , landlords want to retain their suite occupants if they can . The lawyers are more concerned about whether they 'll ever get their security deposits back , and if they 'll be able to afford any rent rises . For now , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . Many attorneys are reviewing alternative arrangements for handling their library and staff services . And Angelo J.
