The budget predicts less red ink but high unemployment <P> In a State of the Union speech a President can describe his program in appealing generalities , but in the budget he must translate vague words into hard numbers . Ronald Reagan 's budget for fiscal 1984 suffers more than a little in that translation . It features a spending freeze that really is not a freeze , and a plan to reduce deficits that would still leave them distressingly high . Moreover , it bases all calculations on a set of predictions about unemployment , output and interest rates so gloomy as to make clear that if the economy is " on the mend , " as Reagan proclaims , the mending will be excruciatingly slow . <P> For those very reasons , however , the budget is far more realistic than the first two that Reagan submitted , which combined heady estimates of expenditure savings with overly optimistic economic forecasts to produce deficit predictions that wandered into dreamland .

The increase would be only a bit above the anticipated rate of inflation , thus allowing Reagan to claim that he has in effect " frozen " expenditures in real terms and cut them $32 billion below what would be paid out if all Government programs continued unchanged . But the so-called freeze would be extremely uneven . After adjustment for inflation , military outlays would jump 9% . Civilian spending in real terms would drop 3% , but only if the Administration is correct in calculating that even a creeping economic recovery will reduce payments for unemployment compensation and farm-price supports by $15 billion . That drop is not included in the $32 billion of expenditure savings because it is supposed to be automatic , but it is the biggest deficit-reducing item in the whole budget . <P> REVENUES .

Will soar to $208 billion in fiscal 1983 , nearly double last year 's record , $110.7 billion . For fiscal 1984 the deficit would drop to between $188 billion and $189 billion ; by Reagan 's figuring , that would be $42 billion less than if Congress enacted no changes in spending and tax programs . But in fiscal 1985 the deficit would rise by $5 billion , to $194 billion , largely because tax collections , held down by the final stages of Reagan 's 1981 cuts , will not rise fast enough to match increases in spending .
