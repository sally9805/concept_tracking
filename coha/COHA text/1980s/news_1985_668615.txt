After a brief but eventful courtship involving misunderstandings and a teenage singing group , Lana Turner is marrying Stewart Granger . The area at the stern of the M/V Royal Princess is garlanded with paper flowers , and well-dressed passengers , seemingly oblivious to the broiling tropical sun , line the railings of the sun deck to witness the alfresco ceremony on the fantail . The wedding is play acting  --  a key scene being taped for a " Love Boat " television special  --  but the ship is real , a 1 , 200-passenger cruise ship making its maiden voyage from Miami to Los Angeles . Granger , playing a stuffy retired British army general , almost slips while walking down a companionway , but when the Love Boat ' s Capt . Merrill Stubing ( Gavin MacLeod ) asks the matrimonial question , the reply is a firm " I do , indeed ! " Turner , depicting a sweetly duplicitous would-be grandmother , coos her own " I do " and flutters her eyelashes at Granger . " Don ' t look at the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice couple they are . . . Think what a nice day this is for a wedding , and then applaud , " intones director Bob Scheerer . The camera focuses on a wedding party that includes the popular teen musical group Menudo ( Granger is supposed to be their chaperone ; Turner plays a childless woman who wants to be a surrogate grandmother ) , " Love Boat ' s " own much-married ship ' s doctor Adam Bricker ( Bernie Kopell ) and vivacious , ever-affable cruise director Judy McCoy ( Patricia Klous ) . Then the camera pans across a railing lined with self- consciously smiling passengers . For many of the passengers , some of whom have paid as much as $9 , 800 for a two-week cruise , the thrill of sailing in luxury on the world ' s newest and most expensively made ( $160 million ) cruise ship is secondary . For a few brief moments  --  when the special is aired in the spring  --  they will be background actors on the M/V Love Boat .

" It ' s a print ! " shouts Scheerer , a pronouncement that is followed by a faint cheer . With one key scene wrapped up , the cast , crew and extras disperse to prepare for the next round of an almost nonstop shooting schedule during the cruise , not only on board but in ports of call such as Barbados , Curacao and Acapulco . Once again " Love Boat " is at its classic , hugely profitable Noah ' s Ark routine . The show ' s unvarying formula consists of overlapping love stories involving the tender young , the usually humorous middle-aged and the invariably warm older love . The last of these , known to the " Love Boat " cast as " The Warmly , " generally involves guest appearances by name actors and actresses , such as Turner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , Janet Gaynor and Lew Ayres , Jane Wyman and Dennis Morgan  --  along with cameo appearances by celebrities as disparate as Helen Hayes , the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders and Vanessa Williams . Sailing into its ninth season , the show is an international phenomenon seen in 47 countries . In the United States it is watched each Saturday in season by an estimated 50 million viewers . Even more popular than the regular one-hour " Love Boat " shows are the two-hour specials twice a year that attract audiences of 70 million or more . Most " Love Boat " episodes are filmed in a Hollywood studio , using sets that duplicate a cruise ship ' s lounge , stateroom and swimming pool and stock footage of the M/V Pacific Princess , the official " Love Boat . " For the specials , however , the " Love Boat " crew goes to sea and abroad , giving viewers a vicarious trip to exotic places as well as an additional happy ending or two . In the past , " Love Boat " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orient with skipper Stubing and his crew : Doc Bricker , cruise director McCoy , bartender Isaac Washington ( Ted Lange ) , yeoman purser Gopher Smith ( Fred Grandy ) , plus daughter Vicki ( Jill Whelan ) , changing ships and even cruise lines to suit locales . On this special , scenes of this maiden voyage from Miami across the Caribbean , through the Panama Canal , up the Mexican Riviera to Los Angeles will form the background for the show . " Like ' Gunsmoke , ' ' Bonanza ' and all the long-running shows , ' Love Boat ' has a real sense of family , " said executive producer Douglas Cramer . It is a rather extended family . On this cruise , the entourage numbers 147 people , including bit players , technicians , family and friends of the regular cast and guest stars . But the " family " works hard . The cast and crew breakfasted at 5 : 30 a. m. and often worked well into the evening . This routine seemed all the more spartan in contrast with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that there wasn ' t some lounging around the pool . Several scenes were shot entirely on the lido deck , which meant long hours for actors immersed in pools and stretched out on deck chairs . The show ' s long run has coincided with the greatest growth period in the history of the cruise industry : In the last decade , the number of North American cruise ship passengers has increased by 300 percent . The year " Love Boat " set sail , 1976 , only 600 , 000 Americans and Canadians took cruises ; last year , about 1. 7 million did . The youthful , romantic and racially integrated image of cruising that " Love Boat " projects is credited by the cruise industry with doing much to lower the avarage age of cruise passengers and diversify their backgrounds . " There was talk of giving us an award once , but nothing came of it , " Cramer said . This season , two new young characters have been added to the " Love Boat " staff : ship ' s photographer Ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basketball coach on " Happy Days " ) , and Kim , the vivacious aerobics instructor , portrayed by Michelle Johnson , a 19-year-old model . Kopell , a 20-year acting veteran , has written a number of " Love Boat " scripts along with Grandy , who plays a rather dim-witted character on television but is a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard . As a senior , he wrote the 1970 Hasty Pudding Club production , " The Boy Who Cried Beowulf , " and the same year helped found the legendary improvisational theater The Proposition in Inman Square in Cambridge . " We created Inman Square , " he said . " Before we came there was nothing there . " Grandy has made no secret of his disdain for the lack of dimension and substance in most " Love Boat " storylines . " The characters haven ' t grown enough , but it ' s getting better . " However , " Love Boat " is the only ship in the world where no one swabs decks , chips paint or oils engines , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d like to see us do an ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' with guest stars playing crew members as well as passengers . It would be terrific . Take a ship like this ( the Royal Princess ) : There must be 500 crew on board . That ' s a whole other world . " Even though no one seems to be minding the engine room , Grandy doesn ' t think the " Love Boat " is likely to founder . " This show is going to last longer than my marriage , " he said . Grandy was married for 12 years .
