Those television-network correspondents who cover the White House are able and competitive men . But with one foot in show business and the other in journalism , they must perform a difficult straddle . The question in Washington is whether they are becoming more like rock stars than reporters  --  the Mick Jaggers of journalism , so highly paid , so powerful and self-important that they feel no personal constraints . Indeed , it sometimes seems that the more bizarre their behavior , the greater their fame and audience . <P> This has long been a point of tension between writers and broadcasters and has bothered many television viewers as well . But the issue emerged starkly a few days ago , when President Reagan showed up in the pressroom to announce a tentative agreement with the Soviets to reduce intermediate-range nuclear weapons . He had hardly finished when ABC 's Sam Donaldson , CBS 's Bill Plante and NBC 's Chris Wallace simultaneously shouted questions at him for almost 20 seconds , creating an incredible din and an embarrassing spectacle . Reagan had little chance to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the correspondents would yield to the other , even though it was a live broadcast . Print reporters , no saints themselves , shook their heads in despair . Secretary of State George Shultz laughed in thinly veiled disgust . Reagan let the scene play out to his advantage . ABC Anchorman Peter Jennings , standing by in New York City , was appalled by the " babble , " and said so over the air . <P> Backstage at the White House , there was some gratification derived from the fact that the American people had at last been able to witness the arrogance of electronic journalism . " The network correspondents quite often think they are more important than the President , " says a Reagan aide . When Newsday 's veteran White House hand , Saul Friedman , upbraided Wallace for his performance , the NBC man told him to lay off , since they were both in the same business . " Oh , no , we 're not , " shot back Friedman . That is the point . Do the highly charged careers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , to prance shamelessly on the electronic stage ? Must their efforts to capture the President with their big-bore cameras and intimidating snarls become a prime-time animal act , information be damned ? <P> Now , in calmer waters , the Big Three are a bit contrite . " It wo n't happen again , " says Donaldson , who called the display " idiotic . " Yet he is the leader of the shouters . Wallace too says he is " very concerned "  --  but he feels compelled to match Donaldson . Plante apologized to the public , but wo n't drop out of the cacophony . None of the three was criticized by network owners or editors . All blame Reagan for not having enough news conferences , interviews and appearances to fill their needs . When the President does show up , the result is what one network official calls a " feeding frenzy , " with flying elbows , shouts , roars , groans . Reagan could shut it off with a stern finger-pointing . Harry Truman would have cut the bunch down to pips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to hurt good .
