Need for long-term care <P> Like so many victims of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) , Morgan MacDonald , 27 , has had his good periods and his bad as the disease runs its course . Last month officials at Shands Hospital in Gainesville , Fla. , pronounced him " well enough to walk , " and spent three weeks looking for an extended-care facility that could handle his needs . They could find none . Finally , Shands got in touch with the AIDS/KS Foundation , a private group in San Francisco that helps those with the affliction . On Oct. 4 , Shands paid for flying MacDonald , accompanied by a doctor and two social workers , to San Francisco aboard a chartered air ambulance . But when he arrived , MacDonald was so weak that he had to be admitted to San Francisco General Hospital . Mayor Dianne Feinstein charged that the transfer was " outrageous and inhumane , " and Mervyn Silverman , the city 's public health director , declared that the episode was " a dump of the worst kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . <P> Last week those claims were bitterly denounced by Shands officials , who convincingly argued that they had acted in good faith , but the MacDonald case focuses attention on a growing medical problem : how to handle AIDS patients who do not need hospital care . Most victims who are discharged from hospitals , which have neither the facilities nor the money to handle them indefinitely , are forced to fall back on family and friends , plus the support of homosexual organizations . ( About 70% of AIDS patients are gay or bisexual . ) In Florida 's Dade County , which encompasses Miami , only one of the 37 state-licensed nursing homes has ever taken in AIDS victims . Miami 's Jackson Memorial Hospital has had patients who could have been discharged if a place had been found for them ; the hospital has not even been able to find a foster home for a patient who is nine months old . <P> San Francisco , which has 289 AIDS victims , a group surpassed only by New York City 's 988 , is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visiting-nurse program and Shanti ( " inner peace " in Sanskrit ) , a volunteer organization that provides peer counseling for the terminally ill and their families and runs two residences for AIDS patients . San Francisco is also planning to open a special , long-term treatment center . <P> The problem of handling AIDS victims as outpatients seems sure to grow . As of Oct. 122,467 cases had been reported to the Government 's Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , compared with 1,180 at the end of 1982 . Moreover , the incidence is increasing . In July ( the latest month so tabulated ) there were 53 new cases a week . A year before , there were eleven .
