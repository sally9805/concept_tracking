Neither side in Afghanistan 's nine-year-old civil war wasted much time last week in attempting to fill the country 's power vacuum . Just three days after the departure of the last Soviet troops based in Afghanistan , as major cities became the target of sporadic but deadly rebel rocket attacks , the government of President Najibullah abruptly slapped a state-of-emergency decree on the country . The mujahedin , meanwhile , after two weeks of paralyzing delays , managed to reach at least tentative agreement on the leadership of a rival government-in-exile . <P> Meeting in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi , Muslim delegates to a shura , or consultative assembly , appeared set to nominate as Prime Minister of their " interim " government Ahmat Shah , 44 , a U.S.-trained engineer and hard- line fundamentalist . Muhammad Nabi Muhammadi , 68 , a former member of Afghanistan 's parliament , was named to fill the largely ceremonial office of President . The shura thus managed to bridge , for the moment , the principal issue dividing the rebel side : whether post-Soviet Afghanistan should be governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or as one that is moderate and secular . Shah strongly advocates the fundamentalist approach , and Muhammadi heads one of the moderate factions . <P> While choosing one exemplar of each approach for the interim government 's two top posts would be an obvious attempt at compromise , it would not guarantee that Shah and Muhammadi will be able to work together smoothly . Shah , moreover , owes his position at least in part to strong backing from the Pakistani intelligence service , a source of support that is resented by many Afghans , who view it as meddling . <P> Still another weakness of the team is that it was being advanced without the agreement of Afghanistan 's Shi'ite Muslims , who are boycotting the shura . <P> Despite the fractious relations among the rebel leaders , most observers still look to them to make the next move in the Afghan showdown . There are seven factions altogether , all rooted in Islam , Afghanistan 's universal faith . The four fundamentalist leaders : <P>  --  Burhanuddin Rabbani , 48 , heads the Jamiat-i-Islami ( Islamic League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology professor at Kabul University , Rabbani has fought against Afghan governments since 1970 . Rabbani 's main weakness : his political strength lies with the Tajik and Uzbek ethnic groups in a country that has traditionally been ruled by Pashtuns . <P>  --  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , 41 , best-organized and most ruthless of the rebel leaders , heads a faction of the Hezb-e-Islami ( Islamic Party ) . Despite his outspokenly anti-Western views , he is reportedly allotted 25% of the total U.S. weapon supply by the Pakistanis , more even than Rabbani . An engineer by training , Hekmatyar is a religious extremist who would keep Afghan women in purdah . <P>  --  Maulvi Younus Khalis , 70 , the only political leader who also regularly serves as a military field commander , leads an independent faction of the Islamic Party . A former village mullah dismissed as something of a bumpkin by his rivals , Khalis sports a henna-dyed beard and in 1987 took a 16-year-old bride . He vehemently opposes elections ; in his view , the only constitution needed for post-Soviet Afghanistan is the Koran . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
