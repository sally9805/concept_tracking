Speeches by Associate Justices John Paul Stevens last week and William J. Brennan Jr . Oct. 12 dramatized the concern provoked in the Court ' s marble edifice by the Administration ' s drive to change the course of constitutional law. // Since the defeat of Franklin D. Roosevelt ' s court-packing plan in 1937 , it has been rare for top executive branch officials to assail the Supreme Court directly. // And it has been virtually unheard of for members of the Court off the bench to criticize the constitutional views of top executive branch officials. // // Justices Wary of Tangling // Because much of the Court ' s authority rests on its appearance of Olympian detachment and impartiality , Justices have traditionally been wary of debate on politically charged issues . This tradition is eroding . The latest salvo came today when Terry H. Eastland , the Justice Department ' s top spokesman , echoed a deprecating phrase Justice Stevens had lobbed at Mr. Meese last week . " His argument is somewhat incomplete , " Mr. Eastland said of Justice Stevens. // He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interpreting the Constitution , had failed to specify an alternative . " Too often judges have been guided by their own personal views rather than by what the people have agreed to in statutes and the Constitution , " Mr. Eastland said . <> <> Meese and Bennett Began It // The debate started this summer with sharp critiques by Mr. Meese and Education Secretary William J. Bennett of recent Supreme Court decisions on religion and other issues. // Mr. Meese has assailed recent decisions such as the one written by Justice Stevens in June , which barred school prayer in Alabama , as well as older precedents , such as the 1966 decision requiring the police to inform arrested suspects of their rights to remain silent and have a lawyer , the Miranda decision. // But the debate transcends crime , abortion and other specific controversies . It reaches to the heart of the the courts ' role in the United States in restraining majority rule. // Justices Stevens and Brennan , while muting their messages , have made it clear that they have a low opinion of Mr. Meese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meese Was Rebuked on Views // Justice Stevens ' s speech began with an off-the-cuff account of how the Justices spend their summer recess . But he included a rebuttal of an address July 9 in which Mr. Meese outlined his conservative views on constitutional law . Several scholars said this was the first speech they could recall in which a Justice had rebuked a sitting Attorney General by name. // Justice Stevens disputed Mr. Meese ' s suggestions that the Court had erred in applying the Bill of Rights to the states , his arguments that the Court should hew closely to the views of the framers in construing the Constitution , and his criticisms of the Court ' s enforcement of strict separation of church and state. // Justice Stevens said of Mr. Meese ' s suggestion that the Court had erred in applying the First Amendment to the states : " The development of his argument is somewhat incomplete . " <> <> Impact of Civil War Cited // He said that Mr. Meese had failed to mention " the profound importance " of the Civil War and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has sat on the Supreme Court " in the last 60 years had questioned that states must honor First Amendment freedoms. // Justice Brennan , in a speech Oct. 12 , dismissed as " little more than arrogance cloaked as humility " the view that decisions on the meaning of the Constitution should be based on the original intention of the men who wrote it . He did not mentioned Mr. Meese or his call July 9 for " a jurisprudence of original intention. " // But scorn for the school of thought that Mr. Meese has brought to prominence was palpable in Justice Brennan ' s suggestion that " the chorus of lamentations calling for interpretation faithful to ' original intention ' - and proposing nullification of interpretations that fail this quick litmus test - must inevitably come from persons who have no familiarity with the historical record . " <> <> Rehnquist on Roosevelt // Not since the Court-packing plan , when Roosevelt gave what Justice William H. Rehnquist depicted in a speech on Friday as " a rip-snorting oration " assailing the Court for striking down New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism at the Court. // The current debate does not match 1937 ' s in intensity . The Court has not been a major obstruction to the Administration ' s program . And President Reagan has neither used harsh rhetoric against the Court since he took office nor called for anything like the Roosevelt plan to reverse its orientation by expanding it. // But even when the Court ' s institutional integrity was under attack in 1937 , the only direct response was a strategically timed statement in which three Justices disputed the President ' s contention that the Court needed new members to keep up with its caseload . They avoided airing their constitutional disagreements with Roosevelt . <> <> Administration Is Pleased // While members of the Court have become more vocal off the bench in recent years , they have generally confined themselves to specialized subjects such as their caseload , or to revoicing jibes at one another already enshrined in dissents. // Mr. Meese , Mr. Eastland and other conservative critics are pleased that Justices Brennan and Stevens have helped give prominence to the Administration ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name new Justices who will move the law sharply to the right . They seek to prepare public opinion for reconsideration of constitutional principles , once hotly debated , that time and the accumulation of precendent seem to have etched in stone. // Mr. Eastland ' s first reaction to the Stevens speech was to observe with evident delight , " it ' s remarkable what ' s started here . " Today , he added , " We believe a thorough airing of these issues that have often gone unexamined is needed. " //
