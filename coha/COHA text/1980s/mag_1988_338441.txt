Every spring , residents of the tiny Danish island of Anholt , midway between Denmark and Sweden , eagerly await the arrival of the harbor seals that breed on the island 's sandy beaches . This year , however , they have been witnesses to a mysterious season of death . So far , more than 150 dead and dying seals and their prematurely born pups have washed ashore ; in the past few weeks , Lighthouse Keeper Einar Boisen and others have been picking up as many as 17 dead seals a day . Says Boisen : " We 've started calling ourselves the death patrol . " <P> The harvest of corpses has raised fears in countries abutting the North Sea that all the seal pups in the region could be wiped out . The toll to date : at least 450 adults and pups in Denmark and an additional 50 in West Germany , out of a total population of 10,000 to 15,000 in the region . Many scientists strongly suspect that acute pollution of the North Sea is a major culprit . Says West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've found have shown high concentrations of heavy metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons . " <P> Scientists believe the adult seals ' immune systems have been weakened by chemical pollutants in the water , making them susceptible to pneumonia induced by a herpes-type virus . Such ravaging of a seal population is not unprecedented : a flu virus , for example , killed more than 500 harbor seals along the coast of New England from Cape Cod , Mass. , to Maine over a period of ten months beginning in December 1979 . This time , researchers believe , the deadly virus may have originated in slaughterhouse refuse deposited in open dumps along Sweden 's western coast . It may then have been transmitted by sea gulls to the seal breeding grounds offshore . <P> Every year six tons of chlorinated hydrocarbons , 11,500 tons of heavy metals and 1.5 million tons of nitrogen from fertilizers are deposited in the North Sea by rivers and acid rain . An additional 250,000 tons of liquid chemical waste are dumped annually from West German ships into the sea . In Bonn Environment Minister Klaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seal deaths , but he did admit to a " very serious suspicion " that industrial wastes may have played key roles . Topfer has promised to end offshore dumping by the end of 1989 . Environmentalists are calling for an immediate ban . <P> As if the seal deaths were not bad enough , a sudden bloom of yellow algae is spreading a carpet of death in the region . Believed to be stimulated by fertilizers that wash into the North Sea , the algae are suffocating salmon and trout in fish farms , as well as other marine life along 1,000 miles of coastal Denmark , Sweden and Norway .
