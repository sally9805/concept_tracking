ONE DAY , late in December , while working on my science-fiction novel , The Killer Spelling Bee Meets the Conqueror Bookworm . I was distracted by a loud buzzing outside my window . I looked up to see , flying above the rooftops , a flock of last decade 's brightly colored buzzwords ? along with some cliches and catch-phrases ? migrating toward the 1980s . Though I quickly got out my binoculars and my Here &; Now Lexicon , I was able to spot only consciousness and jogging bringing up the rear , and somewhat farther ahead , engaged in their distinctively erratic midflight mating , quiche and disco . As the flock faded from view . I waxed melancholic at the thought that some of them would not make it : some would not go the distance . I was about to carry this fertile brooding back to mywriting desk when across the window fell a long shadow , the contours of which were immediately familiar to me as those of the hardy perennial buzzword of the Seventies , rogue illiteracy . Fascinated , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dully pecking at some crumbs of wit I keep there for unexpected guests . I realized that my situation was similar to that described by John Keats when he set down his theory of " negative capability , " a nineteenth-century version of " intuition . " Since the heroes of my novel had for some time been hurling rhetorical questions at each other , I decided to test Keats 's theory by imagining the plight of someone over whom the shadow of illiteracy might fall with malign effect . C ONSIDER MR . BONAPROP , a respectable citizen , proud of his family , home , and career , college-educated , socially conscious , and this evening sitting alone in his study . In fact . in a brown study , for Mr. Bonaprop is musing on the fate of his four-year-old son , who will soon be passing through at least twelve years of increasingly expensive education . He thinks of the child 's bright eyes , eager for the scanning of words , and his delicate fingers , handy for the turning of pages and the holding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occasionally , a subordinate clause . The treasures of conversation , literature . and self-expression await him . Why , then , thinks Mr. Bonaprop. must I abandon him to the American educational system , only to have his eyes dulled after two dozen school terms , his pasteboard diploma dangling from nearly vestigial fingers , his blank countenance foreshadowing the college man ? and betokening the illiterate ? As he ascends the stairs to his son 's bedroom . Mr. Bonaprop performs some calculations . At roughly-five hours a day , five days a week , for some thirty-two weeks a year , those twelve years represent 9,600 hours of classroom activity , or 400 twenty-four-hour days . Twelve years equal thirteen months , relatively speaking . The significance of this eludes him , but he realizes that the reductive figure may prove useful whenever his son complains of school 's seeming endlessness ; " It 's only thirteen months , " he will be able to reply . Outside his son 's bedroom Mr. Bonaprop looks through the bookcase for something to read to him , but where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Seuss fantasies , now there is , inexplicably , but one thick , heavy volume , bound in black leather . Shrugging , he takes the book . enters his son 's room , and , sitting at his bedside , begins the tale , which is entitled Why . Johnny Ca n't Read : Once upon a time there was a boy named Johnny . He was the hero of American education be . cause he could be so many things to so many people . Johnny could be in grammar school or high school or college . He could be black or white or Hispanic . He could live in the suburbs or in the big cities , and sometimes he lived in what was called the inner city but was really just a ghetto . In fact , Johnny was Everyboy , a remark . able hero who liked to do only three things : learn to read and write , watch television , and take multiple-choice examinations ... . Mr. Bonaprop stops reading and glances over at his son . He is asleep . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , and not suitable for his innocent ears , his bright eyes , eager for .... ' CAN WELL IMAGINE Mr. Bona-prop 's anxiety . Since 1970 , when the C.S. Office of Education de- clared war on functional illiteracy , parents have endured an unending barrage of slogans and acronyms as two 92 of the three Rs twisted in ever-shifting winds of economics and fashion . Among the more familiar : Back-toBasics , Open Admissions , SEEK , bilingual education , black English , ESL , ETS , SAT ? culminating at the end of the decade with HEW metamorphosing , in part . into ED. , the preferred abbreviation for the new Department of Education . However well-intentioned , this frenzy of reform seems a kind of pedagogical Punch ' n ' Judy Show . A drop in the average scores on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test ( SAT ) moved teachers back to an emphasis on spelling and grammar . Then the Educational Testing Service ( ETS ) , which produces and administers the SAT , was charged with manufacturing defective merchandise : interpretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proven value of coaching and cramming . Meanwhile , Open Admissions had discovered thousands of college freshmen deficient in reading and writing abilities . As a result , Back-to-Basics received more support at the grammar- and high-school levels , and a concordance to the vocabulary of freshman English showed remedial to be the word on everyone 's lips , Programs like the Search for Education , Elevation , and Knowledge ( SEEK ) dealt in particular with underprivileged students , while experiments with English as a Second Language ( ESL ) , bilingual education , and black English recognized that Back-to-Basics , by itself , was not enough . In the penumbra of all these bright hopes were the voices crying in the wilderness , the purists ? also known as the popularizers . Edwin Newman 's Strictly Speaking 11974 ) and A Civil Tongue ( 1976 ) demonstrated that grammatical propriety can attain the best-seller lists . Several national magazines maintained regular columns on the corruption of the English language , among them one for Esquire by drama and movie critic John Simon . a prominent guest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Cavett in December , 1978 , for his public-television interview show . Finally , readers of Russell Baker 's " Sunday Observer " column in the New York Times Magazine were surprised not long ago to find it taking second place to William Safire 's column , " On Language . " Coming into the 1980s , the odds still do not seem to favor Johnny 's emerging from all this confusion with any degree of proficiency in reading and writing . The New York Times of Sunday , January 6 , contained a separate section devoted to a " Winter Survey of Education . " The front-page headline read " INNER-CITY SCHOOLS SHOW SIGNS OF PROGRESS , " yet it covered two different stories , subtitled " Changing Methods Raise Educators ' Hopes . and , on the other side of the ellipsis , " ... But Many Students Continue to Be Hobbled by Illiteracy . " The Educational Testing Service , James Fallows points out in the cover story of the February Atlantic , is being criticized by , among others , the PTA , the NAACP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving cause for hope , the formation of the Department of Education more likely suggests that in addition to the millions in federal funds already spent and misspent over the past decade of educational chaos , the bureaucratic worst is yet to come . IT IS BECAUSE Mr. Bonaprop is a regular reader of the dailies . the weeklies , and several of the better monthlies that he fears for his son 's literate future . For the old saw " no news is good news , " the press has its own corollary : good news is not news . Thanks to that imbalance , the anxious parent can see only the dismal portents of a dunce 's cap on every head , and never the light at the end of the funnel . There is light , however , and room for optimism in two recently published books about teaching . They are not the sort of thing to rely on for diversion during a long bus ride , nor will they outdo a best-seller as a gift . But they will go some distance toward restoring Mr. Bonaprop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Great American Writing Block : Causes and Cures of the New Illiteracy , * started teaching in the early 1970s in the SEEK program at York College , City University of New York . He was surprised by the command of the spoken language evident in most of his students . They had all been tested and found to need remedial work , yet , Wheeler writes , " they were able to *189 pages . Viking , $8.95. speak forcefully and could summon an eloquence , a lyricism , when encouraged to write . " Encouragement and dedication were Wheeler 's principal tools . His revolutionary approach was to make students see the connection between writing and self-expression , to bring together a sense of basic skills with the students ' strong sense of identity . Then , too , he had them write frequently , and read frequently , both American literature and their own compositions for classroom discussion .

In all this there is nothing extraordinary ; on the contrary , Wheeler 's methods are abundantly , effectively obvious , and he gives evidence of their effectiveness with numerous examples of his students ' writing . Wheeler 's simplicity and directness is complemented by the comprehensiveness of The ABCs of Literacy : * A Guide for Parents and Educators. by Stephen N. Judy . Professor Judy teaches English at Michigan State University and is the editor of The English Journal , a magazine for high-school teachers . His book is a how-to omnibus , and one that by the sheer number of its suggestions , both practical and idealistic , virtually guarantees a renewal of hope for the embattled Rs . Early in the book , he offers a reassuring echo of Wheeler : " Getting something down on paper is frequently as important to the writer as to the readers " ; and " Writing skills are said to be in decline , so teachers double their efforts to teach grammar and spelling ( and assign fewer compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that constant reading and writing more fully develop the basic skills than any amount of drill work . That belief firmly anchors Professor Judy when he moves outside the classroom to propose community-wide projects , both to broaden the students ' educational experience and to get the community , be it hamlet . town , or city , involved in the education of its children . Judy anticipates skeptics who might envision each school term as an *361 pages .

Undoubtedly , the intended market for The ABCs of Literacy is the teaching profession . The nine-page bibliography . twelve pages of generic or age-oriented reading lists for students , " 100 projects for improving literacy instruction " ( a chapter in itself I. and countless references to books , experiments , and problems in the education profession ( with an occasional lapse into its jargon ) support the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers are only in loco parentis ; parents will also profit from owning a copy and referring to it as often as the need for information and reassurance requires . F AILING TO TAKE at least that much interest in the future of education could lead to the sort of reverie into which a dozing Mr. Bonaprop has fallen . As he imagines it , he and his son are sitting in a cubicle , the walls of which are made entirely of books . Their seats are piles of books , and they have drawn them up close to a fire burning in the center of the cubicle . Into the fire they feed books to keep it going , now and then tearing out a page and eating it to keep themselves going . For what seems like the thousandth time , his son turns to him and begins their only conversation . " What are these , Daddy ? " " These are books . Son . " " Books are good , are n't they , Daddy ? " " Yes , they are , Son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedside . He smiles with relief to see peeking from beneath the bedclothes a copy of The Cat in the Hot . Reading already , he thinks , and happily tosses the heavy black volume out the window . As for the illiteracy on my window ledge , it took off some time ago . It looked to me a hit bedraggled , and I believe it was headed in the wrong direction .
