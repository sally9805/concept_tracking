 | For Jamie Kellner , president of the Fox Broadcasting Co. , the move was nothing short of war . It was October 1989 , and after three shaky years , America 's " fourth TV network " had finally started to pull its act together . Fox programs like " The Tracey Ullman Show , " " Alien Nation " and " America 's Most Wanted " had won small , but loyal , audiences , the support of deep-pocketed sponsors , even some critical acclaim . But now rivals , sensing opportunity , were on the attack . Paramount and MCA had joined forces to launch a fifth TV network . Their strategy : to produce two nights of shows by January 1991 and distribute them to local affiliates ? including some of Fox 's biggest stations . The stations , in effect , were being asked to choose . Would they entrust their future to Fox or the new upstart ? " What they were proposing , " says Kellner , " was to stop Fox . " Kellner knew he had to act fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whistlestop tour of six cities , pleading his case to Fox 's biggest affiliates . The stations stood with Fox ? thus depriving MCA / Paramount of access to about 30 percent of the nation . " MCA / Paramount just could n't make a go of it , " says Larry Gerbrandt , vice president of Paul Kagan &; Associates , a media-analysis firm . " It was the first test of the strength of Fox 's affiliate relationship . And it wo n't be the last . " Mired programs : The showdown ? and the successful resolution of it ? was just the latest example of the surprising turnaround of Fox TV . Just 18 months ago , analysts expressed doubts about the survival of the network , pet project of media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Fox Inc. chairman Barry Diller . All nine of Fox 's programs were mired in the Nielsen basement and sponsors were nervous . With losses at a staggering $94 million since the network 's debut in the fall of 1986 , Richard Sarazen , chief financial officer of Murdoch 's News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murdoch would pull the plug in six months . Today all that has changed . Fox 's quirky program mix ? ranging from " tabloid television " to hip , irreverent comedies ? have attracted a new generation of young viewers unencumbered by loyalties to the Big Three networks . As the majors ' audience declines ? down to 69 percent of primetime viewers in 1989 ? Fox 's has grown 56 percent since the 1987-88 season ; it now pulls in 14 percent of TV viewers on Sunday nights . Last summer an episode of " Married ... With Children , " a situation comedy about a raunchy suburban family , leapt into the top 20 ? eclipsing its timeslot rivals on ABC , CBS and NBC . What 's more , the network 's appeal among teenagers and young adults has made it a " must buy " among advertisers , even though Fox shows underperform the Big Three 's fare . About 5 million homes watch Fox 's " 21 Jump Street , " a Mondaynight drama about undercover cops in an urban high school , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But 9C percent of " Jump Street 's " audience is under 30 . " The three networks have been losing audiences ? mostly from kids looking for alternatives , " says Betsy Frank . senior vice president of Saatchi &; Saatchi Advertising , New York . " Fox gives advertisers the chance to buy back those kids . " For the 1989-90 season , Fox sold $300 million in advertising ? three times what is sold its first year . That 's much less than NBC 's $1.7 billion ? but Fox 's staff and overhead are much smaller . The network has begun to turn a profit since July 1989 . Says Gerbrandt : " They 're definitely the fourth force . They 're there . " But can Fox stay there ? That 's the question that Diller , Kellner and other Fox executives are asking as they transform Fox into a full-service network . Currently , Fox I does exactly what the Big Three do , but on a  | much smaller scale : it buys programs made by independent producers , then distributes them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stations around the United States . Affiliates receive a fee to air the shows in specified time slots ; Fox retains some advertising time and sells it to national sponsors . By the end of 1991 , Diller plans to expand to seven nights of prime-time programming , plus Saturday and weekday afternoon children 's shows , even an evening news program . The projects will require hundreds of millions of dollars ? a huge gamble given the increasing fragmentation of TV audiences into cable and video . Just as daunting will be the task of sprucing up the Fox image : the network built its ratings partly with voyeuristic shows like " America 's Most Wanted , " " Cops " and " The Reporters , " serving up lurid re-creations of murders and " investigations " into the sleazy underworld of prostitutes and addicts . Lately , sponsors have balked . Anheuser-Busch is a key Fox sponsor , but refuses to buy ads during " America 's Most Wanted , " and General Mills has expressed concern about " Cops . " Fox 's risque sitcoms have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-family attitudes " of " Married . . . With Children , " Michigan housewife Terry Rakolta whipped up a letter-writing campaign ; Fox has since been rethinking its " anything goes " creative policy . " Fox needs to find shows that its target audience wants to watch , and not alienate advertisers in the process , " Frank says . Green light : If the gamble pays off , it will represent a dramatic vindication for Diller , the balding , intense executive nicknamed " The Shark " by associates . Diller , who , in his late 20s , invented " The Movie of the Week " at ABC , first saw the potential of a fourth network nearly a decade ago . While chairman of Paramount Pictures , Diller sensed the market was right for such a venture , since many stations were growing desperate for programming . Gulf + Western , Paramount 's parent , rejected the idea , and Diller later jumped to Twentieth Century Fox . Murdoch , who bought the studio , gave Diller the green light by buying six Metromedia stations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . Fox unveiled its first night of prime-time shows in 1987 with 105 stations and advertising from Johnson &; Johnson and Bristol-Myers . Fox programming chief Garth Ancier , then a 28-year-old protege of NBC president Brandon Tartikoff , shaped the network 's youthful image . Ancier budgeted $150 million for programs by such independent producers as Ed . Weinberger , who 'd helped make " The Mary Tyler Moore Show " a hit for CBS . But by the summer of 1988 , nothing was working . The average overall rating for Fox was 3.6 ? which translated into 2 million viewers below what the network had promised advertisers . All of Fox 's programs ? " The New Adventures of Beans Baxter , " " Werewolf , " " Mr. President " ? were failing . Fox had to provide millions of dollars ' worth of " make goods , " or free ad spots , to disgruntled sponsors . " No matter what we did ? go out there and bang tambourines ? nobody watched , " says Diller . Fox was desperate . Lacking new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1988 scheduled " America 's Most Wanted . " Its principal attraction : it could be produced for a bargain-basement $150,000 an episode , compared with $300,000 for a sitcom . To Diller 's amazement , in its second week the show achieved the highest rating ever for a Fox program . " We got a little heartbeat , " says Diller . Fox added more " reality " programs that sum- mer , including " The Reporters . " Then the screenwriters guild strike crippled the three networks , forcing them to rerun series late into the fall . Bored viewers flipped the dial to Fox , sampling the network 's mix of sitcoms and tabloid TV . Many liked what they saw . Says Gerbrandt : " People who had given up on Fox suddenly were taking a second look . " Diller is now fine-tuning his strategy . The network has toned down the sensationalism of " The Reporters , " and is experimenting with tamer , fact-based programs like " Totally Hidden Video , " a " Candid Camera " knockoff . Still targeting young audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Simpsons " ( box ) and Francis Ford Coppola 's " The Outsiders , " based on the 1983 movie . Many affiliates are also participating in " The Fox Kids Network , " which will debut next fall on Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons . Diller does n't have many doubts that Fox can successfully expand to seven nights a week , despite the enormous cost . " This thing 's real , " he says . " The only thing that could take this away from us is monstrous stupidity . " Strutting like a field marshal inside the " War Room " of his suite in Fox 's executive office building in Los Angeles , Diller grabs a bright-colored magnet labeled " It 's Garry Shandling 's Show " and slams it against a programming board that covers one wall . " This is a unique show , " he boasts . Poking his finger contemptuously at a rival network 's sitcom , Diller proclaims " This is n't unique . " Diller now has to prove that he can maintain Fox 's brash appeal while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing everything he 's gained .
