It all seemed innocent enough . The sheriff , a friend of the family , addressed Mr. Tsuneishi respectfully as ' ' papa san ' ' and said they wanted to talk to him at the local courthouse. // It would be the last time she would see him for 2 years. // // The two men , she later learned , were from the FBI , and her father , a Japanese-American who was a local community leader , was spirited away to a detention camp. // The rest of the family , including seven children , were interned at a relocation center in Arkansas , one of many set up in World War II to hold Japanese-Americans out of fear they were spies for Tokyo. // Forty-three years and a tsunami of memories later , Sally Tsuneishi believes the US government owes her and other survivors of the infamous camps redress for their forced internment. // They may get it. // After years of consideration , and some debate , Congress for the first time is considering issuing a formal apology and paying reparations to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' When there have been injustices done , there should be some reparations , ' ' says Mrs. Tsuneishi , sitting on a hopsack couch in her modest home in this Los Angeles suburb . ' ' This is the American system. ' ' // Legislation authorizing the apology and setting aside $1. 25 billion for payment of $20 , 000 to each of the surviving internees could come up in the House this week. // With the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution being celebrated Thursday , sponsors of the redress move see the timing as symbolic of how unfair it was for the country to set aside the basic constitutional protections of the Japanese-Americans during the war. // ' ' It ' s not just a piece of legislation to pay people off who were unjustly put in prison , ' ' says Rep. Robert Matsui ( D ) of California. // A prime backer of the bill , Mr. Matsui spent time in one of the detention camps as a child . ' ' We ' re talking about a situation where a government charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country because of their racial background , ' ' he says. // In the Senate , which is expected to take up its version of the legislation before the end of the month , passage is virtually assured , since the measure has 76 co-sponsors . Approval in the House is less certain . Although the bill does have strong bipartisan support , there is some opposition to the payment provision. // Critics contend that , even though the internment was reprehensible , the US can ' t afford the outlays . Nor do some think the government should make the payments . They reject the idea that an apology need be backed up by money to be sincere . And they worry that the reparations could set a dangerous precedent for other minorities who have been wronged. // ' ' When we are making very tough decisions in many areas , I think we have to look carefully at every expenditure , ' ' says Rep. Dan Lungren ( R ) of California. // It is also uncertain what President Reagan would do , should the legislation end up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment provision in congressional testimony. // In addition to the apology and payments , the legislation would establish a ' ' public awareness ' ' trust fund to disseminate information about the camps and try to prevent similar acts. // The legislation grew out of a study in 1981-82 by the congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians . It concluded that racism and wartime hysteria were the reasons behind the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry . An estimated 75 , 000 of the internees were US citizens ; 41 , 000 were Japanese resident aliens. // Redress supporters argue that $1. 25 billion represents only a fraction of the documented property and employment losses suffered by the internees. // Although redress was first proposed several years ago , sponsors of the legislation say it has taken this long for public and congressional awareness to catch up with the issue. // A group of former internees and members of the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team , a US Army unit made up solely of Japanese-Americans that was the most decorated in US history , have mounted a concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We don ' t expect this to be defeated , ' ' says a congressional staff member. // In the Japanese-American community , the idea of reparations stirs mixed feelings . Some believe the legislation and similar efforts in the courts just reopens painful wounds . Others view it as an essential part of the healing process. // ' ' There is a split of sentiment over what sort of action they would like to see , if any action at all , ' ' says Chris Komai , an editor of Rafu Shimpo , a Los Angeles-based Japanese-English newspaper. // Sally Tsuneishi ' s 2 years were spent in a relocation camp in a muggy corner of Arkansas . Being a teen-ager , she says adjustment to camp life came easier for her than for her mother and other adults . There were school , occasional dances , talent shows , football games , and long nights thumbing through the Sears catalog ( ' ' our only contact with the outside world ' ' ) . // But there were also plenty of reminders that this wasn ' t a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoehorned into two rooms with cement floors , the barbed wire fences , the armed sentries , the searchlight sweeping through the upper window each night. // ' ' There are a lot of us who want to look back and try to resolve some of the feelings we had , ' ' she says evenly . ' ' It is a part of our lives today . It affects the way we think , the way we feel . It affects our kids. ' ' // Jim Kawaminami still thinks of his experience , too . The retired TV repairman spent a year and a half in camps , including time under guard at the Santa Anita Racetrack near here , where he spent part of his youth watching horses. // Mr. Kawaminami , slight and reflective , sits in his living room and recalls : ' ' We were wondering , why us ? We were Americans . We were born here . We were raised here . We went to school here.

All the while his parents were in an internment camp in Colorado. // ' ' On furlough , we didn ' t go home to visit our parents , ' ' he says . ' ' We went to the camps. ' ' // ' ' I feel bad because a lot of Americans don ' t believe it happened , ' ' he says of the internment . ' ' We have to go and make sure these things don ' t happen to our kids.
