For Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne , Pa. , the death of their nine-year- old Arlena after heart surgery last month was heartbreaking  --  on top of anguish that began after presurgery tests of Arlena 's blood revealed she was Type B positive . The Twiggs both have Type O blood , which meant that Arlena probably had not been their natural child . <P> Devastated by this news , the parents reviewed oddities surrounding their daughter 's birth at Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula , Fla. , on Dec. 2 , 1978 . After delivery , their pink-cheeked infant scored a perfect 10 on the Apgar health rating . Nevertheless the baby the Twiggs took home suffered from a heart abnormality . The child 's weight was allegedly changed from 8 lbs . 6 oz. to 6 lbs . on the birth certificate , which also recorded Arlena 's blood type as O. A battery of genetic tests proved that the child the Twiggs had raised for ten years could not have been their daughter . Last week the family filed a $100 million lawsuit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had switched the healthy newborn with a sickly infant whose mother had already relinquished it for adoption .
