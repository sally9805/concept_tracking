The camera even tried to capture Mrs. Aquino ' s goodbye wave in the small window of a Philippine Airlines jet . It was yet another example of what high hopes Filipinos place on their new leader ' s visit to the US , which ruled the Philippines for half a century. // But despite the expectations and potential benefits , Aquino ' s visit could not be more ill-timed in at least three ways : // * As head of a provisional government , Aquino arrives without a new constitution in hand . Both she and US officials had hoped she would have one. // // * She holds talks with her nation ' s private creditors without the agreement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) planned by her economic ministers. // * Her negotiations back home with communist leaders have all but collapsed , leaving Aquino with a tough decision - delayed by her eight days in the US - on whether to unleash the military against the guerrillas. // Of the three issues , the likelihood of renewed warfare with the 16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NPA ) is the most difficult for Aquino . She is widely applauded abroad for coming to power last February in a relatively peaceful revolt and with promises of national reconciliation. // All three disappointments , however , are not likely to overshadow the American red-carpet welcome for Aquino . Besides speaking before Congress Thursday and the United Nations next Monday , she will be given two honorary degrees. // The delay in producing a new constitution - caused when the Aquino-appointed Constitutional Commission missed its Sept. 2 deadline - presents two problems for the President. // First , the constitution-writers , although generally conservative , began debate this week on the future of the US military bases here , and the debate ' s outcome is far from predictable - a cloud hanging over Aquino ' s talks with the Reagan administration. // The Constitution Commission is giving serious thought to making the Philippines a nuclear-free nation like New Zealand . This would effectively bar ships or planes carrying nuclear weapons and would thus render almost useless the US ' s largest naval and air force bases outside its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military strategy in the Pacific . Western diplomats say the US is working actively to prevent such a clause in the Philippines ' new constitution. // The second problem the delayed constitution causes is that , without knowing exactly what kind of government is being set up , potential foreign investors may be reluctant to make any promises to Aquino during her discussions with them in various US cities. // US officials are confident the IMF will soon ink a pact with the Philippines to help it cope with its $26 billion foreign debt . But international bankers may remain wary that last-minute hitches in the bargaining could prevent an agreement. // Western diplomats are less sure that Aquino will achieve a cease-fire pact with the NPA , the military arm of the Communist Party . She has demanded an immediate 30-day cease-fire . But the communists first want : the Philippine armed forces ordered to stay in their barracks ; the dismantling of the Civilian Home Defense Forces ( paramilitary village units ) ; police put under control of local authorities ; and the disarming of private armies . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Her original plan to woo low-level communist rebels out of the hills while coopting their leaders into ending armed struggle has not worked . In fact , the President gets regular complaints that the NPA has expanded its sphere of influence since she ordered the armed forces into a less aggressive ' ' defensive posture ' ' toward insurgents . And reports of NPA guerrillas ambushing soldiers come in almost daily. // ' ' She wants to ' give peace a chance , ' ' ' one Western diplomat said . ' ' But once the record is clear that the NPA will not go along with her , she can proceed against the NPA with full moral authority . She ' s now making the record . She also wants the military to win . She doesn ' t want them to go out and get their clock cleaned , ' ' the diplomat said. // If anything , the talks have given the military time to reform itself after becoming politicized and corrupt during 14 years of martial law under deposed President Ferdinand Marcos . Military reform is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurgency . The other parts are an improved economy , elections under a new constitution , a revamped court system , and land reform. // Some public impatience toward the talks has found a voice in the recent outbursts of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile . Mr. Enrile , who was also Mr. Marcos ' s defense minister , says he supports the Aquino strategy but puts no faith in the communists ' sincerity in the cease-fire talks . His public dissent sparks fears in Manila that a coup is in the works . But Enrile commands far less allegiance among the military rank and file than does the armed forces chief of staff , Gen. Fidel Ramos , a staunch Aquino ally who believes force should be the last option against the insurgency. // ' ' Enrile is 63 years old , head of the military , and uncertain of his future , ' ' the diplomat said . ' ' He sincerely believes the talks are useless , and Aquino says , ' But is the military ready to fight ? ' He says , ' Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // Before her departure , Aquino suggested that the cease-fire talks could move down to the regional level , thus allowing the military to renew anti-NPA campaigns in some areas and perhaps dividing the NPA . But diplomats say that in order to avoid the kind of human-rights abuses committed by the Marcos military , Aquino will have to be highly discretionary in choosing the areas for attack and in controlling the military units . <> <> Aquino fails to fill Imelda ' s shoes // The first thing Americans may notice about President Corazon Aquino is that , in style of dress , she has not followed in the shoes of former first lady Imelda Marcos. // Fashion for this widow-turned-politician is simple . By serving as both President and first lady , Mrs. Aquino has sparked a revolution in Manila ' s faddish social circles . Gone are the expensive butterfly-shouldered dresses ( called ternos ) made from imported fabrics which marked the Marcos era . Instead , Aquino has chosen conservative clothes , perhaps with detailed embroidery , basic jewelry , and , oh yes , inexpensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left 3 , 000 pairs of imported shoes. ) // One dressmaker Aquino often goes to admits that the President ' s tastes are so simple that she ( the dressmaker ) ' ' has to pray ' ' for new ideas . But Aquino ' s appearance signals an effort to send the public ( in the Philippines and elsewhere ) a message : that her administration is dignified , businesslike , and humble. // //
