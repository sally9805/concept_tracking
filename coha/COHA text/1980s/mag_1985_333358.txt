DIED . Alexander Scourby , 71 , plummy-voiced actor and narrator of television and film , including Victory at Sea ( 1954 ) ; of an apparent heart attack ; in Boston . The Brooklyn-born Scourby began on the New York stage in 1936 as a Shakespearean actor . Though he protested , " What actor wants to be known as a voice ? " the rich timbre of his instrument took him early to advertising voice-overs , where he was said at one time to be the highest-priced voice in the business , and to Talking Books for the Blind , where he recorded more than 400 works , including the complete King James Bible , War and Peace , Shakespeare and Joyce 's Ulysses .
