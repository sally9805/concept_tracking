Then you better start swimmin ' <P> Or you 'll sink like a stone <P> For the times they are a-changin ' . <P> Twenty-five years ago , Bob Dylan 's warning to a stick-in-the-mud establishment became a call to arms for a generation of artists and writers determined to burst through the barricades and foment change . Dozens of " alternative " publications were born in the anarchic ' 60s and ' 70s only to sink like stones by the straight-arrow ' 80s . The few that survived are now finding themselves on the receiving end of Dylan 's message . <P> Next month Mother Jones , one of the country 's last bastions of crusading left-wing journalism , will introduce a dramatic redesign aimed at attracting new readers . Earlier this year Ms. magazine , feminism 's longtime standard- bearer , revamped itself in an attempt to broaden its appeal . Both magazines have turned in part to a sure-fire formula : celebrity journalism . The current cover of Ms. features a moody photo of Meryl Streep , while Mother Jones inaugurates its new look with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid- ' 70s , Ms. and Mother Jones were committed to popularizing then radical causes such as equal rights for women , environmentalism and corporate responsibility . Unlike political-opinion magazines that are content to reach a small but influential audience , Ms. and Mother Jones always aimed for a broad readership . But over time , they found themselves increasingly pigeonholed as vestiges of a bygone era . " People had a mistaken impression about what the magazine was doing , " says Mother Jones editor Douglas Foster . Ms. editor Anne Summers , who took over from founder Gloria Steinem last year , was also worried about misconceptions : " Ms. readers do n't all run around wearing dungarees . " <P> In an effort to update its image , Ms. recently launched a trade advertising campaign showing the gradual transformation of a hippie type , complete with beaded headband , into a blow-dried ' 80s woman . The tag : " We 're not the Ms. we used to be . " The campaign is reminiscent of a highly successful series of ads for another ' 60s-era publication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine next to the " reality . " Perception : a psychedelic van . Reality : a spiffy red sports car . <P> But while it was relatively easy for Rolling Stone ( circ. 1.18 million ) to follow its franchise , rock ' n ' roll , into the mainstream , Ms. and Mother Jones have not had as clear a path . Named after turn-of-the-century labor organizer Mary Harris Jones , Mother Jones established itself as a passionate muckraker with a 1977 expose that alleged Ford had been aware of what turned out to be a fatal defect in its Pinto . Over the years the magazine has gradually increased its cultural coverage , a trend that will continue in its new incarnation . But the new Mother Jones will also try to appeal to its older readers by introducing columns about politically correct travel and even personal finance . Whereas it once called itself " a magazine for the rest of us , " the new Mother Jones is less of an upstart , offering the subtitle People , Politics , and Other Passions .
