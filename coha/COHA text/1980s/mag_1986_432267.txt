 | Sometimes when I handle a divorce action , the couple seeking to end their marriage seems so hopelessly mismatched that I wonder how they ever got together in the first place . At other times I am amazed that the two people could have endured the emotional pain they inflicted on each other for as long as they did . In fact , it sometimes seems to me that my clients are in greater need of therapy than of divorce ? and in such situations I recommend they see a therapist . Here is a sampling of some of the more memorable kinds of marital conflicts I 've handled in my law practice in New York . Though the names used here , along with some other identifying facts , have been changed , the cases are real ones from my casebook . They will serve to point out that though divorce laws may vary from state to state , the human conflicts that cause breakups are the same everywhere . WIFE ABUSE Tragically , cases involving physical abuse are all too common . But this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one but two destructive marriages had more surprises than most . Anne , 35 , an attractive , very successful fashion designer , always looked so perfectly put together you 'd think she was on her way to be photographed . Her husband , Don , was a handsome , charming 24 year old who had been a lifeguard and a model and talked vaguely about becoming an actor . When Anne and Don met , it was instant romance : Within a few weeks they moved in together , and three months later they married . That 's when Anne 's rose-colored glasses came off . Don , the adoring , attentive lover , turned overnight into a nasty , critical husband . He belittled Anne in front of her friends by calling her names and cursing her . Finally , after they got home from a party at which he had humiliated her again , she told him she could not put up with his behavior any longer . Don responded by flying into a rage : He struck her , then tried to strangle her . Terrified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . She was still in a state of shock when she came to see me at my office the next day . I immediately helped her get a Family Court order of protection that barred Don from entering their apartment . But Don paid no attention to the court order . He broke into the apartment and assaulted Anne . Again she called the police and had him removed . A few days later the " old " Don suddenly reappeared : He sent her flowers , told her how much he really loved her ( claiming his abusive behavior had been caused by stress ) , and , in his most ingenuous manner , begged for forgiveness . Of course , Anne melted . The two had a tearful reunion , and Don moved back in . But in a matter of days they were back in a pattern of assault . lockout , and reconciliation . The next time I saw Anne , she came to consult me about a divorce . She had a black eye and a swollen jaw . I 'd seen the physical signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ever  | be prepared for the sickening sight of black-and-blue marks on a woman 's face . I heard the desperation in Anne 's voice as she said , " My life and career are in danger . I have to get out of this . " I helped Anne get her divorce , after which she resumed the career she had badly neglected during her tempestuous marriage . Two years later she met Simon , a prominent dress designer , 20 years her senior . He had been twice married and divorced . When Simon asked her to marry him , Anne was sure that this relationship would be very different . But , eerily , it turned out to be a replay of her life with Don : The blissful courtship soon turned into a violent marriage . One night Simon beat her so severely that she had to go to the hospital for emergency treatment . The next day Anne came to see me to initiate divorce proceedings . At least she had learned one lesson : There were no court orders this time ? and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anne got out immediately . Anne obviously had deep-seated problems that baffled her as much as they did inc . In my last conversation with her , I strongly urged her to talk to a psychiatrist or a minister to delve into the reasons why she chose two men , so different on the surface yet identical in their compulsion to hurt her . Since I have never heard from her again , I can only hope that she has found a path to happiness . CHILD SNATCHING Among the most heartbreaking cases I see are those in which the divorcing couple use their children as pawns in a struggle against each other . This can occur even among otherwise stable , intelligent parents , and it can be especially prevalent if the parents are too immature or confused to recognize the terrible damage they are doing to their children . Stunning , suntanned , and blond , Sheila and Bryan looked like a pair of grown-up children . I never saw them wearing anything but jeans and Tshirts ? plus earphones that always blared rock music . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years and were the parents of two adorable preschoolers , Joan and Carolyn . At this point , the marriage was so troubled that the couple had separated . The girls were living with Sheila in a tiny Manhattan apartment , shared with a cousin who looked after the children while Sheila worked as a photographer 's assistant . One day , however , Bryan took the two little girls to live with him , his aunt , uncle , and their family in New Jersey . At first , Sheila agreed to the arrangement , and visited the children frequently while the couple 's divorce action got under way . Then , in his legal papers , Bryan claimed that Sheila had too many emotional problems to be a fit mother ; he wanted custody of the children . Sheila was furious . " I 'm going to New Jersey and take my kids back . Can I get in trouble for doing that ? " she asked me . I explained that if she " snatched " the children away from their father before there was a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " kidnapper . " But I made it clear that judges frown severely on " childsnatching . " I was sure 1 'd talked her out of doing anything rash , but the very next day she drove to New Jersey , picked up her children , and drove away with them . She did not tell me where she had taken them . Bryan applied to the court for a temporary order of custody . Sheila wanted to simply ignore the order , but I convinced her that if she did , she could lose the children ; so we went to court . There , the judge said he was not sure of the fitness of either parent , and gave temporary custody to Bryan 's aunt and uncle , allowing both parents visitation privileges . Sheila visited her little girls once or twice . By the time the couple 's divorce action came before the court , both parties had reversed themselves : Bryan no longer wanted custody ; Sheila definitely wanted her babies back . At that point , the judge ordered a psychological evaluation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subject to Bryan 's right of visitation . But just one week later Sheila dropped the children off with Bryan . left the city , and has not been heard from since . Bryan , who now did n't want custody either , arranged for Joan and Carolyn to move in with his aunt and uncle and their large , lively family , who were only too eager to welcome them . In the course of the proceedings I 'd had many misgivings , as had the judge , about the ability of either Sheila or Bryan to give their fought-over but neglected little girls the parenting they needed . In the end I was relieved that this sort. ) , situation sorted itself out in what I felt was the best way possible for the children ? Bryan 's aunt and uncle could offer them a calm , loving environment that contrasted with the erratic life they 'd known . But cases like this one always leave me with a sharp stab of sadness for the innocent children involved . I believe we should all work for legal changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent court-ordered evaluations of the contending parents and special at-@#  | torneys appointed to protect the interests of the children . THE OTHER WOMAN The proverbial " other woman , " who is cited as the reason for a marital breakup , is still alive and well ? hut the 1986 variation of this old theme often has a different angle . Janet , 31 , a petite sun-streaked blonde , and Frank , 35 , a ruggedly handsome man who was proud of his terrific tennis game , had been married for six years . A bright , gregarious couple with many friends , they lived in a sprawling suburban house with its own tennis court . Janet earned $30,000 a year as a hospital administrator ; Frank drew $60,000 as an executive in his family 's successful knitwear business . They had no children . On a business trip to Germany Frank met and began an affair with llsa . Eventually Frank found a position for Iisa in his family 's firm and helped her move to this country . From time to time thereafter , they would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips . After one such trip , Frank left on his desk at home a photograph of llsa and himself lounging in beach chairs at an island resort . Janet found the picture and confronted Frank . Weeping , she told her husband she loved him and begged him to give up Ilsa . Forced to make a decision , Frank chose Ilsa . Janet came to me to work out a separation agreement . She was pale and distraught , her eyes red from crying . She must really love her husband , I thought ? or was it her life with him that she loved ? In any event , she began making very large demands which Frank seemed only too eager to meet . So eager , that he gave her : $70,000 in a lump sum property settlement ; spousal maintenance until her death or remarriage ; a new car every three years ; money to relocate ; half the stock , treasury bills , and bank accounts the couple owned ; payment for all her insurance , and all her counsel fees , and credit cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except , of course , Frank as a husband . This was a familiar type of case in which one partner 's ( usually the husband 's ) guilty conscience prompts him to make a settlement far in excess of what the court world have awarded . A judge would not have given a woman in Janet 's position anything more than the lump-sum settlement . How did she react to her astonishing windfall ? She immediately thought of several other substantial items she should have asked for ! Which , I thought , may explain why Frank made the choice he did . EMOTIONAL TUG-OF-WAR I 've discovered one axiom over and over again in my cases : People who are emotional adversaries will find the most incredibly petty things to argue about . Barbara and Robert proved that . Barbara , a business administration trainee , and her husband , Robert , a graduate student , had been married for three years when Barbara came to me seeking a divorce . Before their wedding they had gone steady for several years , and neither one had had any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific complaint against Robert and there was no other man in her life ( nor woman in Robert 's ) , Barbara wanted her freedom . To me she seemed to be one of those impatient young people who thinks that if something seems slightly broken , there is no choice but to throw it out . She quickly rejected my suggestion of marital counseling . The marriage was n't living up to expectations , so rather than try to find out why , she was ready to move on . As Robert was not contesting the divorce , the only problem was the division of their modest property . At first , negotiations between the couple , and between Robert 's lawyer and me , went smoothly . Barbara and Robert split their bank account of about $1,000 , and both moved out of their apartment without any argument . They also agreed on the division of charge cards , income tax responsibilities , and other obligations . Then we hit a monumental snag : household furnishings . Robert 's attorney asked for a list of everything the couple had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pans , ash trays , even clothespins . Barbara prepared a detailed inventory . Item by item they went down the list ? Barbara took the polka dot sheets , Robert took the green sheets ; she took the blue shower curtain , he took the striped one . . . and on and on . This division of the spoils dragged on for days . I tried to talk my client out of engaging in such a childish game , but there was no dissuading either husband or wife from their battle . When they started arguing about the contents of the medicine cabinet , the spice shelf , and the cabinet beneath the sink , I threw up my hands . I refused to be a party to the splitting up of the scouring powder and the oregano ! Eventually they somehow managed to divide everything up and they got their divorce . While this kind of bickering can reach almost comic proportions , it is anything but funny . Like many other couples , Barbara and Robert , in some perverse way , enjoyed prolonging their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items as requests for the love they had not been able to give each other during their marriage . What  | a shame they had never been able to communicate their real needs ? the emotional ones ? to each other . i fell very sorry for both of them . RECONCILIATION I 'm happy that not all my cases end bitterly . Ironically , there are times when a breakup can lead to a breakthrough , which saves a marriage that was dying of boredom and apathy . Marisa , a retired actress , and Burton , the president of a prosperous manufacturing company , had been married for 23 years and had a son entering college . The couple lived in a spacious , antiquefilled townhouse , where they enjoyed entertaining their friends frequently and well . But something was still missing for Marisa . When she visited me , she could not put her discontent precisely into words , except to say that she was " unhappy " and wanted to end her marriage . Burton , who had told Marisa , " I 'm perfectly happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent him . Normally , I would have negotiated with Burton 's lawyer but now I had to discuss the issues with Marisa , who then went home and negotiated with Burton herself . For a while their dialogue about financial arrangements was friendly , but then Burton began to balk at giving Marisa everything she wanted , which was really very little in terms of their ample marital property . Now , for the first time in the couple 's married life , there were ugly scenes and heated name-calling . During one such shouting match , Burton suddenly announced that he would contest the divorce . Perhaps he thought that his wife would back down at the prospect of waging a contested divorce ? but on the contrary , Marisa bitterly dug in her heels more than ever . In retaliation , Burton threatened to divorce her . The next day Marisa came , sobbing , " How can he do this to me after all our years together ? " I calmed her down and pointed out that he was only doing to her what she was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what strategy she should try next . And that was the last time I saw Marisa ! Two years later I received a letter from her , thanking me for everything I had done for her and telling me that she and Burton were back together and extremely happy . I was delighted . Of course , I had n't done a thing to bring this couple back together . As sometimes happens , the threats of divorce on both sides forced the two people involved to re-examine a marriage they had probably been taking too much for granted . Venting their anger was the first healthy step toward talking out their problems and realizing that they could make the charges needed to save their relationship . is n't it too bad that some people have to go to the brink of losing what is most precious to them before they discover how much they really value it ? Although my professional life revolves around the dissolution of marriages , the cases that make me the happiest ? the ones that prompt me to say to my husband at the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today " ? are the occasional instances when a contending couple calls a truce and figures out how to live in peace with each other . I hope to see more of those ....
