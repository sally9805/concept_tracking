while looking straight ahead , " Son , are you running away from home ? " Lewis Farren astonished him by smiling  --  not grinning and not faking it , but actually smiling . He thought the whole notion of running away from home was funny . It tickled him . The boy glanced at him a fraction of a second after Buddy had looked sideways , and their eyes met . For a second , for two seconds , three ... for however long that momentlasted , Buddy Parkins saw that this unwashed boy sitting beside him was beautiful . He would have thought himself incapable of using that word to describe any male human being above the age of nine months , but underneath the road-grime this Lewis Farren was beautiful . His sense of humor had momentarily murdered his worries , and what shone out of him at Buddy  --  who was fifty-two years old and had three teenage sons  --  was a kind of straightforward goodness that had only been dented by a host of unusual experiences . This Lewis Farren , twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seen more than Buddy Parkins , and what he had seen and done had made him beautiful . " No , I 'm not a runaway , Mr. Parkins , " the boy said . Then he blinked , and his eyes went inward again and lost their brightness , their light , and the boy slumped back again against his seat . He pulled up a knee , rested it on the dashboard , and snugged the newspaper up under his bicep . " No , I guess not , " Buddy Parkins said , snapping his eyes back to the highway . He felt relieved , though he was not quite sure why . " I guess yore not a runaway , Lewis . Yore something , though . " The boy did not respond . " Been workin on a farm , have n't you ? " Lewis looked up at him , surprised . " I did , yeah . The past three days . Two dollars an hour . " And yore mommy did n't even take the time out from bein sick to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that right ? Buddy thought . But what he said was " Lewis , I 'd like you to think about coming home with me . I 'm not saying yore on the run or anything , but if yore from anywherearound Cambridge I 'll eat this beat-up old car , tires and all , and I got three boys myself and the youngest one , Billy , he 's only about three years older'n you , and we know how to feed boys around my house . You can stay about as long as you like , depending on how many questions you want to answer . ' Cuz I 'll be asking em , at least after the first time we break bread together . " He rubbed one palm over his gray crewcut and glanced across the seat . Lewis Farren was looking more like a boy and less like a revelation . " You 'll be welcome , son . "  |p201Smiling  , the boy said , " That 's really nice of you , Mr. Parkins , but I ca n't . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Buckeye Lake , " Buddy supplied . The boy swallowed and looked forward again . " I 'll give you help , if you want help , " Buddy repeated . Lewis patted his forearm , sunburned and thick . " This ride is a big help , honest . " Ten nearly silent minutes later he was watching the boy 's forlorn figure trudge down the exit ramp outside Zanesville . Emmie would probably have brained him if he 'd come home with a strange dirty boy to feed , but once she 'd seen him and talked to him , Emmie would have brought out the good glasses and the plates her mother had given her . Buddy Parkins did n't believe that there was any woman named Helen Vaughan in Buckeye Lake , and he was n't so sure this mysterious Lewis Farren even had a mother  --  the boy seemed such an orphan , off on a vast errand . Buddy watched until the boy was taken by the curve of the off-ramp , and he was staring out at space and the enormous yellow-andpurplesign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping out of the car and running after the kid , trying to get him back . . . and then he had a moment of recall of a crowded , smokey scene on the six-o'clock news . Angola , New York . Some disaster too small to be reported more than once , that was what had happened in Angola ; one of those little tragedies the world shovels under a mountain of newsprint . All Buddy could catch , in this short , probably flawed moment of memory , was a picture of girders strewn like giant straws over battered cars , jutting up out of a fuming hole is the ground  --  a hole that might lead down into hell . Buddy Parkins looked once more at the empty place on the road where the boy had been , and then stamped on his clutch and dropped the old car into Low . Buddy Parkins 's memory was more accurate than he imagined . If he could have seen the first page of the month-old Angola Herald " Lewis Farren , " that enigmatic boy , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words he would have read : FREAK EARTHQUAKE KILLS 5by Herald staff reporter Joseph GarganWork on the Rainbird Towers , intended to be Angola 's tallest and most luxurious condominium development and still six months from completion , was tragically halted yesterday as an unprece/dented earth tremor collapsed the structure of the building , burying many construction workers beneath the rubble . Five bodies have been retrieved from the ruins of the proposed condominium , and two other workers have not yet been found but are presumed dead . All seven workers were welders and fitters in the employ of Speiser Construction , and all were on the girders of the building 's top two floors at the time of the incident . Yesterday 's tremor was the first earthquake in Angola 's recorded history . Armin Van Pelt of New York University 's Geology Department , contacted today by telephone , described the fatal quake as a " seismic bubble . " Representatives of the State Safety Commissionare continuing their examinations of the site , as is a team of ... The dead men were Robert Heidel , twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Michael Hagen , twenty-nine ; and Bruce Davey , thirty-nine . The two men still missing were Arnold Schulkamp , fifty-four , and Theodore Rasmussen , forty-three . Jack no longer had to look at the newspaper 's front page to remember their names . The first earthquake in the history of Angola , New York , had occurred on the day he had flipped away from the Western Road and landed on the town 's border . Part of Jack Sawyer wished that he could have gone home with big kindly Buddy Parkins , eaten dinner around the table in the kitchen with the Parkins family  --  boiled beef and deep-dish apple pie  --  and then snuggled into the Parkinses ' guest bed and pulled the homemade quilt up over his head . And not moved , except toward the table , for four or five days . But part of the trouble was that he saw that knotty-pine kitchen table heaped with crumbly cheese , and on the other side of the table a mouse-hole was cut into a giant baseboard ; and from holes in the jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who plays these Jerry Bledsoe changes , Daddy ? Heidel , Thielke , Wild , Hagen , Davey ; Schulkamp and Rasmussen . Those Jerry changes ? He knew who played them . The huge yellow-and-purple sign reading BUCKEYE MALL floated ahead of Jack as he came around the final curve of the off-ramp , drifted past his shoulder and reappeared on his other side , at which point he could finally see that it was erected on a tripod of tall yellow poles in the shopping-center parking lot . The mall itself was a futuristic assemblage of ochre-colored buildings that seemed to be windowless  --  a secondp203later , Jack realized that the mall was covered , and what he was seeing was only the illusion of separate buildings . He put his hand in his pocket and fingered the tight roll of twenty-three single dollar bills which was his earthly fortune . In the cool sunlight of an early autumn afternoon , Jack sprinted across the street toward the mall 's parking lot . If it had not been for his conversation with Buddy Parkins , Jack would very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty miles  --  he wanted to get to Illinois , where Richard Sloat was , in the next two or three days . The thought of seeing his friend Richard again had kept him going during the weary days of nonstop work on Elbert Palamountain'sfarm : the image of spectacled , serious-faced Richard Sloat in his room at Thayer School , in Springfield , Illinois , had fueled him as much as Mrs. Palamountain 's generous meals . Jack still wanted to see Richard , and as soon as he could : but Buddy Parkins 's inviting him home had somehow unstrung him . He could not just climb into another car and begin all over again on the Story . ( In any case , Jack reminded himself , the Story seemed to be losing its potency . ) The shopping mall gave him a perfect chance to drop out for an hour or two , especially if there was a movie theater somewhere in there  --  right now , Jack could have watched the dullest , soppiest Love Story of a movie . And before the movie , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to take care of two things he had been putting off fotaat least a week . Jack had seen Buddy Parkins looking at his disintegrating Nikes . Not only were the running shoes falling apart , the soles , once spongy and elastic , had mysteriously become hard as asphalt . On days when he had to walk great distances  --  or when he had to work standing up all day  --  his feet stung as if they 'd been burned . The second task , calling his mother , was so loaded with guilt and other fearful emotions that Jack could not quite allow it to become conscious . He did not know if he could keep from weeping , once he 'd heard his mother 's voice . What if she sounded weak  --  what if she sounded really sick ? Could he really keep going west if Lily hoarsely begged him to come back to New Hampshire ? So he could not admit to himself that he was probably going to call his mother . His mind gave him the suddenlyvery clear image of a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately bucked away from it  --  as if Elroy or some other Territories creature could reach right out of the receiver and clamp a hand around his throat . Just then three girls a year or two older than Jack bounced out of the back of a Subaru Brat which had swung recklessly into a parking spot near the mall 's main entrance . For a second they had the look of modelsp204contorted into awkwardly elegant poses of delight and astonishment . When they had adjusted into more conventional postures the girls glanced incuriously at Jack and began to flip their hair expertly back into place . They were leggy in their tight jeans , these confident little princesses of the tenth grade , and when they laughed they put their hands over their mouths in a fashion which suggested that laughter itself was laughable . Jack slowed his walk into a kind of sleepwalker 's stroll . One of the princesses glanced at him and muttered something to the brownhaired girl beside her . I 'm different now , Jack thought : I 'm not like them anymore . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue sleeveless down vest climbed out of the driver 's seat and gathered the girls around him by the simple expedientof pretending to ignore them . The boy , who must have been a senior and at the very least in the varsity backfield , glanced once at Jack and then looked appraisingly at the facade of the mall . " Timmy ? " said the tall brownhaired girl . " Yeah , yeah , " the boy said . " I was just wonderingwhat smells like shit out here . " He rewarded the girls with a superior little smile . The brownhaired girl looked smirkingly toward Jack , then swung herself across the asphalt with her friends . The three girls followed Timmy 's arrogant body through the glass doors into the mall . Jack waited until the figures of Timmy and his court , visible through the glass , had shrunk to the size of puppies far down the long mall before he stepped on the plate which opened the doors . Cold pre-digested air embraced him . Water trickled down over a fountain two stories high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops on both levels faced the fountain . Bland Muzak drifted down from the ochre ceiling , as did the peculiar bronzy light ; the smell of popcorn , which had struck Jack the moment the glass doors had whooshed shut behind him , emanated from an antique popcorn wagon , painted fire-engine red and stationed outside a Waldenbooks to the left of the fountain on the ground level . Jack had seen immediately that there was no movie theater in the BuckeyeMall . Timmy and his leggy princesses were floating up the escalator at the mall 's other end , making , jack thought , for a fast-food restaurant called The Captain 's Table right at the top of the escalator . Jack put his hand in his pants pocket again and touched his roll of bills . Speedy 's guitar-pick and Captain Farren 's coin nested at the bottom of the pocket , along with a handful of dimes and quarters . On Jack 's level , sandwiched between a Mr. Chips cookie shop and a liquor store advertising NEW LOW PRICES for Hiram Walker bourbonp205and Inglenook Chablis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of running shoes . The clerk at the cash register leaned forward and watched Jack pick over the shoes , clearly suspicious that he might try to steal something . Jack recognized none of the brands on the table . There were no Nikes or Pumas here  --  they were called Speedster or Bullseye or Zooms , and the laces of each pair were tied together . These were sneakers , not true running shoes . They were good enough , Jack supposed . He bought the cheapest pair the store had in his size , blue canvas with red zigzag stripes down the sides . No brand name was visible anywhere on the shoes . They seemed indistinguishable from most of the other shoes on the table . At the register he counted out six limp one-dollar bills and told the clerk that he did not need a bag . Jack sat on one of the benches before the tall fountain and toed off the battered Nikes without bothering to unlace them . When he slipped on the new sneakers , his feet fairly sighed with gratitude . Jack left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black wastebasket with DO N'T BE A LITTERBUG stencilled on it in white . Beneath that , in smaller letters , the wastebasket read The earth is our only home . Jack began to move aimlessly through the long lower arcade of the mall , searching for the telephones . At the popcorn wagon he parted with fifty cents and was handed a quart-size tub of fresh popcorn glisteningwith grease . The middle-aged man in a bowler hat , a walrus moustache , and sleeve garters who sold him the popcorn told him that the pay phones were around a corner next to 31 Flavors , upstairs . The man gestured vaguely toward the nearest escalator . Scooping the popcorn into his mouth , Jack rode up behind a woman in her twenties and an older woman with hips so wide they nearly covered the entire width of the escalator , both of them in pants suits . If Jack were to flip inside the Buckeye Mall  --  or even a mile or two from it  --  would the walls shake and the ceiling crumble down , dropping bricks and beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be inside ? And would the tenth-grade princesses , and even arrogant Timmy , and most of the others , too , wind up with skull fractures and severed limbs and mangled chests and . . . for a second just before he reached the top of the escalator Jack saw giantchunks of plaster and metal girders showering down , heard the terriblecracking of the mezzanine floor , the screams , too  --  inaudible , they werestill printed in the air . Angola . The Rainbird Towers . Jack felt his palms begin to itch and sweat , and he wiped them on his jeans . THIRTY-ONE FLAVORS , gleamed out a chilly incandescent white lightp206to his left , and when he turned that way he saw a curving hallway on its other side . Shiny brown tiles on the walls and floor ; as soon as the curve of the hallway took him out of sight of anyone on the mezzanine level , Jack saw three telephones , which were indeed under transparent plastic bubbles . Across the hall from the telephones were doors to MEN and LADIES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the area code and the number for the Alhambra Inn and Gardens . " Billing ? " asked the operator , and Jack said , " This is a collect call for Mrs. Sawyer in four-oh-seven and four-oh-eight . From Jack . " The hotel operator answered , and Jack 's chest tightened . She transferredthe call to the suite . The telephone rang once , twice , three times . Then his mother said " Jesus , kid , I 'm glad to hear from you ! This absentee-mother business is hard on an old girl like me . I kind of miss you when you 're not moping around and telling me how to act with waiters . " " You 're just too classy for most waiters , that 's all , " Jack said , and thought that he might begin to cry with relief . " Are you all right , Jack ? Tell me the truth . " " I 'm fine , sure , " he said . " Yeah , I 'm fine . I just had to make sure that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronically , a skirl of static that sounded like sand blowing across a beach . " I 'm okay , " Lily said . " I 'm great . I 'm not any worse , anyhow , if that 's what you 're worried about . I suppose I 'd like to know where you are . " Jack paused , and the static whispered and hissed for a moment . " I 'm in Ohio now . Pretty soon I 'm going to be able to see Richard . " " When are you coming home , Jack-O ? " " I ca n't say . I wish I could . " " You ca n't say . I swear , kid , if your father had n't called you that silly name  --  and if you 'd asked me about this ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later ... " A rising tide of static took her voice , and Jack remembered how she 'd looked in the tea shop , haggard and feeble , an old woman . When the static receded he asked , " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " I sent your Uncle Morgan away from here with a flea in his ear , " she said . " He was there ? He did come ? Is he still bothering you ? " " I got rid of the Stoat about two days after you left , baby . Do n't waste time worrying about him . " " Did he say where he was going ? " Jack asked her , but as soon as thep207words were out of his mouth the telephone uttered a tortured electronic squeal that seemed to bore right into his head . Jack grimaced and jerked the receiver away from his ear . The awful whining noise of static was so loud that anyone stepping into the corridor would have heard it . " MOM ! " Jack shouted , putting the phone as close to his head as he dared . The squeal of static increased , as if a radio between stations had been turned up to full volume . The line abruptly fell silent . Jack clamped the receiver to his ear and heard only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and jiggled the hook . The flat silence in the phone seemed to press up against his ear . Just as abruptly , and as if his jiggling the hook had caused it , the dial tone  --  an oasis of sanity , of regularity , now  --  resumed . Jack jammed his right hand in his pocket , looking for another coin . He was holding the receiver , awkwardly , in his left hand as he dug in his pocket ; he froze when he heard the dial tone suddenly slot off into outer space . Morgan Sloat 's voice spoke to him as clearly as if good old Uncle Morgan were standing at the next telephone . " Get your ass back home , Jack . " Sloat 's voice carved the air like a scalpel . " You just get your ass back home before we have to take you back ourselves . " " Wait , " Jack said , as if he were begging for time : in fact , he was too terrified to know quite what he was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're a murderer now . That 's right , is n't it ? You 're a murderer . So we 're not able to give you any more chances . You just get your can back to that resort in New Hampshire . Now . Or maybe you 'll go home in a bag . " Jack heard the click of the receiver . He dropped it . The telephone Jack had used shuddered forward , then sagged off the wall . For a second it drooped on a network of wires ; then crashed heavily to the floor . The door to the men 's room banged open behind Jack , and a voice yelled , " Holy SHIT ! " Jack turned to see a thin crewcut boy of about twenty staring at the telephones . He was wearing a white apron and a bow tie : a clerk at one of the shops . " I did n't do it , " Jack said . " It just happened . " " Holy shit . " The crewcut clerk goggled at Jack for a split-second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands over the crown of his head . Jack backed away down the hall . When he was halfway down the escalator he finally heard the clerk yelling , " Mr. Olafson ! The phone , Mr. Olafson ! " Jack fled.  |p208Outside  , the air was bright , surprisingly humid . Dazed , Jack wanderedacross the sidewalk . A half-mile away across the parking lot , a black-and-white police car swung in toward the mall . Jack turned sidewaysand began to walk down the pavement . Some way ahead , a family of six struggled to get a lawn chair in through the next entrance to the mall . Jack slowed down and watched the husband and wife tilt the long chair diagonally , hindered by the attempts of the smaller children to either sit on the chair or to assist them . At last , nearly in the posture of the flag-raisers in the famous photograph of Iwo Jima , the family staggered through the doors . The police car lazily circled through the big parking lot . Just past the door where the disorderly family had succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden crate , cradling a guitar in his lap . As Jack slowly drew nearer , he saw the metal cup beside the man 's feet . The man 's face was hidden behind big dirty sunglasses and beneath the brim of a stained felt hat . The sleeves of his denim jacket were as wrinkled as an elephant 's hide . Jack swerved out to the edge of the pavement to give the man all the room he seemed to warrant , and noticed that around the man 's neck hung a sign handwritten in big shaky capital letters on discolored white cardboard . A few steps later he could read the letters . BLIND SINCE BIRTHWILL PLAY ANY SONGGOD BLESS YOUHe had nearly walked past the man holding the beat-up old guitar when he heard him utter , his voice a cracked and juicy whisper , " Yeah-bob. "  |p209ack  swung back toward the black man , his heart hammering in his chest . Speedy ? The black man groped for his cup , held it up , shook it . A fewJ oins rattled in the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Speedy . Jack was sure of it . But a moment later he was just as sure that it was n't Speedy . Speedy was n't built square in the shoulders and broad across the chest ; Speedy 's shoulders were rounded , a little slumped over , and his chest consequently had a slightly caved-in look . Mississippi John Hurt , not Ray Charles . But I could tell one way or the other for sure if he 'd take off those shades . He opened his mouth to speak Speedy 's name aloud , and suddenly the old man began to play , his wrinkled fingers , as dully dark as old walnut that has been faithfully oiled but never polished , moving with limber speed and grace on both strings and frets . He played well , fingerpickingthe melody . And after a moment , Jack recognized the tune . It had been on one of his father 's older records . A Vanguard album called Mississippi John Hurt Today . And although the blind man did n't sing , Jack knew the words : 0 kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To see ole Lewis in a new graveyard , The angels laid him away ... . The blond football player and his three princesses came out of the mall 's main doors . Each of the princesses had an ice cream cone . Mr. All-America had a chili-dog in each hand . They sauntered toward where Jack stood . Jack , whose whole attention was taken up by the old black man , had not even noticed them . He had been transfixed by the idea that it was Speedy , and Speedy had somehow read his mind . How else could it be that this man had begun to play a Missis/sippi John Hurt composition just as Jack happened to think Speedy looked like that very man ? And a song containing his own road-name , as well ? The blond football player transferred both chili-dogs to his left hand and slapped jack on the back with his right as hard as he could . Jack 's teeth snapped on his own tongue like a bear-trap . The pain was sudden and excruciating . " You just shake her easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieked . Jack stumbled forward and kicked over the blind man 's cup . Coins spilled and rolled . The gentle lilt of the blues tune came to a jangling halt . Mr. All-America and the Three Little Princesses were already moving on . Jack stared after them and felt the now-familiar impotent hate . This was how it felt to be on your own , just young enough to be at everyone 's mercy and to be anyone 's meat  --  anyone from a psychotic like Osmond to a humorless old Lutheran like Elbert Palamountain , whose idea of a pretty fair work-day was to slog and squelch through gluey fields for twelve hours during a steady cold downpour of October rain , and to sit bolt-upright in the cab of his International Harvester truck during lunch hour , eating onion sandwiches and reading from the Book of Job . Jack had no urge to " get " them , although he had a strange idea that if he wanted to , he could  --  that he was gaining some sort of power , almost like an electrical charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too  --  that it was in their faces when they looked at him . But he did n't want to get them ; he only wanted to be left alone . HeThe blind man was feeling around himself for the spilled money , his pudgy hands moving gently over the pavement , almost seeming to read it . He happened on a dime , set his cup back up again , and dropped the dime in . Plink ! Faintly , Jack heard one of the princesses : " Why do they let him stay there , he 's so gross , you know ? " Even more faintly still : " Yeah , rilly ! " Jack got down on his knees and began to help , picking up coins and putting them into the blind man 's cup . Down here , close to the old man , he could smell sour sweat , mildew , and some sweet bland smell like corn . Smartly dressed mall shoppers gave them a wide berth . " Thankya , thankya , " the blind man croaked monotonously . Jack could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessya , God blessya , thankya . " He is Speedy . He 's not Speedy.  |p211What  finally forced him to speak  --  and this was not really so odd  --  was remembering just how little of the magic juice he had left . Barely two swallows now . He did not know if , after what had happened in Angola , he could ever bring himself to travel in the Territories again , but he was still determined to save his mother 's life , and that meant he might have to . And , whatever the Talisman was , he might have to flip into the other world to get it . " Speedy ? " " Blessya , thankya , God blessya , did n't I hear one go over there ? " He pointed . " Speedy ! It 's Jack ! " " Ai n't nothin speedy round here , boy . No sir . " His hands began to whisper-walk along the concrete in the direction he had just pointed . One of them found a nickel and he dropped it into the cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed young woman who was passing by . Her pretty , empty face wrinkled in almost painful disgust as she drew away from him . Jack picked the last coin out of the gutter . It was a silver dollar  --  a big old cartwheel with Lady Liberty on one side . Tears began to spill out of his eyes . They ran down his dirty face and he wiped them away with an arm that shook . He was crying for Thielke , Wild , Hagen , Davey , and Heidel . For his mother . For Laura DeLoessian . For the carter 's son lying dead in the road with his pockets turned out . But most of all for himself . He was tired of being on the road . Maybe when you rode it in a Cadillac it was a road of dreams , but when you had to hitch it , riding on your thumb and a story that was just about worn out , when you were at everybody 's mercy and anyone 's meat , it was nothing but a road of trials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but there was no way to cry it off . If he cried it off , the cancer would take his mother , and Uncle Morgan might well take him . " I do n't think I can do it , Speedy , " he wept . " I do n't think so , man . " Now the blind man groped for Jack instead of the spilled coins . Those gentle , reading fingers found his arm and closed around it . Jack could feel the hard pad of callus in the tip of each finger . He drew Jack to him , into those odors of sweat and heat and old chili . Jack pressed his face against Speedy 's chest . " Hoo , boy . I do n't know no Speedy , but it sounds like you puttin an awful lot on him . You  --  " " 1 miss my mom , Speedy , " Jack wept , " and Sloat 's after me . It was him on the phone inside the mall , him . And that 's not the worst thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . earth/quake . . . five men ... me , I did it , Speedy , I killed those men when I flipped into this world , I killed them just like my dad and Morgan Sloat killed Jerry Bledsoe that time ! " Now it was out , the worst of it . He had sicked up the stone of guilt that had been in his throat , threatening to choke him , and a storm of weeping seized him  --  but this time it was relief rather than fear . It was said . It had been confessed . He was a murderer . " H000-eeee ! " the black man cried . He sounded perversely delighted . He held Jack with one thin , strong arm , rocked him . " You tryin to carry you one heavy load , boy . You sure am . Maybe you ought to put some of it down . " " I killed em , " Jack whispered . " Thielke , Wild , Hagen , Davey ... " " Well , if yo friend Speedy was here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , or wherever he might be in this wide old world , he might tell you that you cai n't carry the world on yo shoulders , son .

" " I killed  --  " " Put a gun to their heads and shot somebodies , didya ? " " No . . . the earthquake . . . I flipped .... " " Do n't know nothin bout dat , " the black man said . Jack had pulled away from him a bit and was staring up into the black man 's seamed face with wondering curiosity , but the black man had turned his head toward the parking lot . If he was blind , then he had picked out the smoother , slightly more powerful beat of the police car 's engine from the others as it approached , because he was looking right at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this idear of molder ' a little broad .

Oh look , I done moidered that fella on account of where I was sittin , oh woe , oh d000m , oh gl000000m , oh this . . . oh that ! ' " As he spoke this and that , the blind man punctuated it with a quick change from G to C and back to G again . He laughed , pleased with himself . " Speedy  --  " " Nothin speedy round here , " the black man reiterated , and then showed yellow teeth in a crooked grin . " Cept maybe how speedy some folks are to put the blame on themselves for things others might have got started . Maybe you runnin , boy , and maybe you bein chased . " G-chord . " Maybe you be just a little off-base . " C-chord , with a nifty little run in the middle that made Jack grin in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . " Back down to G again , and the blind man laid his guitar aside ( while , in the police car , the two cops were flipping to see which of them would actually have to touch Old Snowball if he would n't get into the back of the cruiser peaceably ) . " Maybe d000m an maybe gl000000m an maybe this and maybe that ... He laughed again , as if Jack 's fears were the funniest thing he 'd ever heard . " But I do n't know what could happen if I  --  " " No one ever knows what could happen if they do anything , do dey ? " the black man who might or might not be Speedy Parker broke in . " No . Dey do not . If you thought about it , you 'd stay in yo house all day , ascairt to come out ! I do n't know yo problems , boy . Do n't want to know em .

Some things you cai n't help . Sometimes people get killed because somebody does somethin ... but if somebody did n't do that somethin , a whole lot of more people would have got killed . Do you see where I 'm pushin , son ? " The dirty sunglasses inclined down toward him . Jack felt a deep , shuddery relief . He saw , all right . The blind man was talking about hard choices . He was suggesting that maybe there was a difference between hard choices and criminal behavior . And that maybe the criminal was n't here . The criminal might have been the guy who had told him five minutes ago to get his ass home . " Could even be , " the blind man remarked , hitting a dark D-minor chord on his box , " that all things soive the Lord , just like my momma tole me and your momma might have tole you , if she was a Christian lady . Could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Good Book says all things , even those that seem evil , soive the Lord . What you think , boy ? " " I do n't know , " Jack said honestly . He was all mixed up . He only had to close his eyes and he could see the telephone tearing off the wall , hanging from its wires like a weird puppet . " Well , it smells like you lettin it drive you to drink . " " What ? " Jack asked , astonished . Then he thought , I thought that Speedy looked like Mississippi John Hurt , and this guy started playing a John Hurt blues . . . and now he 's talking about the magic juice . He 's being careful , but I swear that 's what he 's talking about  --  it 's got to be ! " You 're a mind-reader , " Jack said in a low voice . " Are n't you ? Did you learn it in the Territories , Speedy ? "  | " Do n't know nothin bout readin minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been out forty-two year come November , and in forty-two year your nose and ears take up some of the slack . I can smell cheap wine on you , son . Smell it all over you . It 's almost like you washed yo hair widdit ! " Jack felt an odd , dreamy guilt  --  it was the way he always felt when accused of doing something wrong when he was in fact innocent  --  mostly innocent , anyway . He had done no more than touch the almost-empty bottle since flipping back into this world . Just touching it filled him with dread  --  he had come to feel about it the way a fourteenth-century Europeanpeasant might have felt about a splinter of the One True Cross or the fingerbone of a saint . It was magic , all right . Powerful magic . And sometimes it got people killed . " I have n't been drinking it , honest , " he finally managed . " What I started with is almost gone . It . . . I . . . man , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clench nervously ; just thinking about the magic juice was making him feel nauseated . " But I need to get some more . Just in case . " " More Poiple Jesus ? Boy your age ? " The blind man laughed and made a shooing gesture with one hand . " Hell , you do n't need dat . No boy needs dat poison to travel with . " " But  --  " " Here . I 'll sing you a song to cheer you up . Sounds like you could use it . " He began to sing , and his singing voice was nothing at all like his speaking voice . It was deep and powerful and thrilling , without the Nigger Jim " My-Huck-dat-sure-is-gay ! " cadences of his talk . It was , Jack thought , awed , almost the trained , cultured voice of an opera singer , now amusing itself with a little piece of popular fluff . Jack felt goosebumps rise on his arms and back at that rich , full voice . Along the sidewalk which ran along the dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the red , red robin goes bob-bob-bobbin along , ALONG , there 'll be no more sobbin when he starts throbbin his old ... sweet SONG  --  " Jack was struck by a sweet and terrible familiarity , a sense that he had heard this before , or something very like it , and as the blind man bridged , grinning his crooked , yellowing smile , Jack realized where the feeling was coming from . He knew what had made all those heads turn , as they would have turned if a unicorn had gone galloping across the mall 's parking lot . There was a beautiful , alien clarity in the man 's voice . It was the clarity of , say , air so pure that you could smell a radish when a man pulled one out of the ground half a mile away . It was a good old Tin Pan Alley song . . . but the voice was pure Territories.  | " Get up . . . get up , you sleepyhead . . . get out . . . get out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh and be ha  --  " Both guitar and voice came to a sudden halt . Jack , who had been concentrating fiercely on the blind man 's face ( trying subconsciously to peer right through those dark glasses , perhaps , and see if Speedy Parker 's eyes were behind them ) , now widened his focus and saw two cops standing beside the blind man . " You know , I do n't hear nothin , " the blind guitarist said , almost coyly , " but I b'lieve I smell somethin blue . " " Goddammit , Snowball , you know you 're not supposed to work the mall ! " one of the cops cried . " What did Judge Hallas tell you the last time he had you in chambers ? Downtown between Center Street and Mural Street . Noplace else . Damn , boy , how senile have you got ? Your pecker rotted off yet from that whatall your woman gave you before she took off ? Christ , I just do n't  --  " His partner put a hand on his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother she wants you , kid , " the first cop said curtly . Jack started walking down the sidewalk . He could n't stay . Even if there was something he could do , he could n't stay . He was lucky the cops ' attention had been taken up by the man they called Snowball . If they had given him a second glance , Jack had no doubt he would have been asked to produce his bona fides . New sneakers or not , the rest of him looked used and battered . It does n't take cops long to get good at spotting road-kids , and Jack was a boy on the road if there ever had been one . He imagined being tossed into the Zanesville pokey while the Zanesvillecops , fine upstanding boys in blue who listened to Paul Harvey every day and supported President Reagan , tried to find out whose little boy he was . No , he did n't want the Zanesville cops giving him more than ' the one passing glance . A motor , throbbing smoothly , coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back and looked down at his new sneakers as if they interested him tremendously . From the corners of his eyes he saw the police cruiser slide slowly by . The blind man was in the back seat , the neck of his guitar poking up beside him . As the cruiser swung into one of the outbound lanes , the blind man abruptly turned his head and looked out the back window , looked directlyat Jack . . . ... and although Jack could not see through the dirty dark glasses , he knew perfectly well that Lester " Speedy " Parker had winked at him.  |p216Jack  managed to keep further thought at bay until he reached the turnpikeramps again . He stood looking at the signs , which seemed the only clear-cut things left in a world ( worlds ? ) where all else was a maddening gray swirl . He felt a dark depression swirling all around him , sinking into him , trying to destroy his resolve . He recognized that homesickness played a part in this depression , but this feeling made his former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adrift , without a single firm thing to hold on to . Standing by the signs , watching the traffic on the turnpike , Jack realized he felt damn near suicidal . For quite a while he had been able to keep himself going with the thought that he would see Richard Sloat soon ( and , although he had hardly admitted the thought to himself , the idea that Richard might head west with him had done more than cross Jack 's mind  --  after all , it would not be the first time that a Sawyer and a Sloat had made strange journeys together , would it ? ) , but the hard work at the Palamountain farm and the peculiar happenings at the BuckeyeMall had given even that the false glitter of fool 's gold . Go home , Jacky , you 're beaten , a voice whispered . If you keep on , you 're going to end up getting the living shit kicked out of you . . . and next time it may be fifty people that die . Or five hundred . I-70 East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coin  --  the coin that was a silver dollar in this world . Let whatever gods there were decide this , once and for all . He was too beaten to do it for himself . His back still smarted where Mr. All-America had whacked him . Come up tails , and he would go down the eastbound ramp and head home . Come up heads , he would go on . . . and there would be no more looking back . He stood in the dust of the soft shoulder and flicked the coin into the chilly October air . It rose , turning over and over , kicking up glints of sun . Jack craned his head to follow its course . A family passing in an old station-wagon stopped squabbling long enough to look at him curiously . The man driving the wagon , a balding C.P.A. who sometimes awoke in the middle of the night fancying that he could feel shooting pains in his chest and down his left arm , had a sudden and absurd series of thoughts : Adventure . Danger . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . He shook his head , as if to clear it ,  |p217and  glanced at the boy in the wagon 's rear-view mirror just as the kid leaned over to look at something . Christ , the balding C.P.A. thought . Get it out of your head , Larry , you sound like a fucking boys ' adventure book . Larry shot into traffic , quickly getting the wagon up to seventy , forgettingabout the kid in the dirty jeans by the side of the road . If he could get home by three , he 'd be in good time to watch the middleweight title fight on ESPN . The coin came down . Jack bent over it . It was heads . . . but that was not all . The lady on the coin was n't Lady Liberty . It was Laura DeLoessian , Queen of the Territories . But God , what a difference here from the pale , still , sleeping face he had glimpsed for a moment in the pavillion , surrounded by anxious nurses in their billowing white wimples ! This face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a classic beauty ; the line of the jaw was not clear enough for that , and the cheekbone which showed in profile was a little soft . Her beauty was in the regal set of her head combined with the clear sense that she was kind as well as capable . And oh it was so like the face of his mother . Jack 's eyes blurred with tears and he blinked them hard , not wanting the tears to fall . He had cried enough for one day . He had his answer , and it was not for crying over . When he opened his eyes again , Laura DeLoessian was gone ; the woman on the coin was Lady Liberty again . He had his answer all the same . Jack bent over , picked the coin out of the dust , put it in his pocket , and headed down the westbound ramp of Interstate 70 . A day later ; white overcast in the air that tasted of chilly rain on its way ; the Ohio-Indiana border not much more than a lick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scrub of woods beyond the Lewisburg rest area on I-70 . Jack was standing concealed  --  he hoped  --  among the trees , patientlywaiting for the large bald man with the large bald voice to get back into his Chevy Nova and drive away . Jack hoped he would go soon , before it started to rain . He was cold enough without getting wet , and all morning his sinuses had been plugged , his voice foggy . He thought he must finally be getting a cold . The large bald man with the large bald voice had given his name asp218Emory W. Light . He had picked jack up around eleven o'clock , north of Dayton , and Jack had felt a tired sinking sensation in the pit of his belly almost at once . He had gotten rides with Emory W. Light before . In Vermont Light had called himself Tom Ferguson , and said he was a shoe-shop foreman ; in Pennsylvania the alias had been Bob Darrent ( " Almost like that fellow who sang Splish-Splash , ' ah-ha-hah-hah " ) , and the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light said he was President of The First Mercantile Bank of Paradise Falls , in the town of Paradise Falls , Ohio . Ferguson had been lean and dark , Darrent as portly and pink as a freshly tubbed baby , and this Emory W. Light was large and owlish , with eyes like boiled eggs behind his rimless glasses . Yet all of these differences were only superficial , Jack had found . They all listened to the Story with the same breathless interest . They all asked him if he had had any girlfriends back home . Sooner or later he would find a hand ( a large bald hand ) lying on his thigh , and when he looked at Ferguson/Darrent/Light , he would see an expression of half-mad hope in the eyes ( mixed with half-mad guilt ) and a stipple of sweat on the upper lip ( in the case of Darrent , the sweat had gleamed through a dark moustache like tiny white eyes peering through scant underbrush ) . Ferguson had asked him if he would like to make ten dollars . Darrent had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald voice that nonetheless cracked and quivered through several registers , asked him if he could n't use fifty dollars  --  he always kept a fifty in the heel of his left shoe , he said , and he 'd just love to give it to Master Lewis Farren . There was a place they could go near Randolph . An empty barn . Jack did not make any correlation between the steadily increasing monetary offers from Light in his various incarnations and any changes his adventures might be working on him  --  he was not introspective by nature and had little interest in self-analysis . He had learned quickly enough how to deal with fellows like Emory W. Light . His first experience with Light , when Light had been calling himself Tom Ferguson , had taught him that discretion was by far the better part of valor . When Ferguson put his hand on jack 's thigh , Jack had responded automatically out of a California sensibility in which gays had been merely part of the scenery : " No thanks , mister . I 'm strictly A.C. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters , mostly , but there had been the men's-shop clerk in North Hollywood who had cheerfully offered to blow him in a changing booth ( and when jack toldp219him no thanks , the clerk said , " Fine , now try on the blue blazer , okay ? " ) . These were annoyances a good-looking twelve-year-old boy in Los Angeles simply learned to put up with , the way a pretty woman learns to put up with being groped occasionally on the subway . You eventually find a way to cope without letting it spoil your whole day . The deliberate passes , such as the one this Ferguson was making , were less of a problem than the sudden gropes from ambush . They could simply be shunted aside . At least in California they could . Eastern gays  --  especially out here in the sticks  --  apparently had a different way of dealing with rejection . Ferguson had come to a screeching , sliding halt , leaving forty yards of rubber behind his Pontiac and throwing a cloud of shoulder-dust into the air . " Who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling queer ? I 'm not queer ! Jesus ! Give a kid a fucking ride and he calls you a fucking queer ! " Jack was looking at him , dazed . Unprepared for the sudden stop , he had thumped his head a damned good one on the padded dash . Ferguson , who had only a moment before been looking at him with melting brown eyes , now looked ready to kill him . " Get out ! " Ferguson yelled . " You 're the queer , not me ! You 're the queer ! Get out , you little queerboy ! Get out ! I 've got a wife ! I 've got kids ! I 've probably got bastards scattered all over New England ! I 'm not queer ! You 're the queer , not me , SO GET OUT OF MY CAR ! " More terrified than he had been since his encounter with Osmond , Jack had done just that . Ferguson tore out , spraying him with gravel , still raving . Jack staggered over to a rock wall , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieks of laughter , and he decided right then and there that he would have to develop A POLICY , at least until he got out of the boondocks . " Any serious problem demands A POLICY , " his father had said once . Morgan had agreed vigorously , but Jack decided he should n't let that hold him back . His POLICY had worked well enough with Bob Darrent , and he had no reason to believe it would n't also work with Emory Light . . . but in the meantime he was cold and his nose was running . He wished Light would head em up and move em out . Standing in the trees , Jack could see him down there , walking back and forth with his hands in his pockets , his large bald head gleaming mellowly under the white-out sky . On the turnpike , big semis droned by , filling the air with the stink of burned diesel fuel . The woods here were trashed-out , the way the woods borderingany interstate rest area always were . Empty Dorito bags . Squashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop-tops thatp220rattled inside if you kicked them . Smashed bottles of Wild Irish Rose and Five O'Clock gin . A pair of shredded nylon panties over there , with a mouldering sanitary napkin still glued to the crotch . A rubber poked over a broken branch . Plenty of nifty stuff , all right , hey-hey . And lots of graffiti jotted on the walls of the men 's room , almost all of it the sort a fellow like Emory W. Light could really relate to : I LIKE TOSUK BIG FAT COX . BE HERE AT 4 FOR THE BEST BLOJOB YOUEVER HAD . REEM OUT MY BUTT . And here was a gay poet with large aspirations : LET THE HOLE HUMAN RACE/JERK OFF ON MY SMILING FACE . I 'm homesick for the Territories , jack thought , and there was no surprise at all in the realization . Here he stood behind two brick outhouses off I-70 somewhere in western Ohio , shivering in a ragged sweater he had bought in a thrift store for a buck and a half , waiting for that large bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride . Jack 's POLICY was simplicity itself : do n't antagonize a man with large bald hands and a large bald voice . Jack sighed with relief . Now it was starting to work . An expression that was half-anger , half-disgust , had settled over Emory W. Light 's large bald face . He went back to his car , got in , backed up so fast he almost hit the pick-up truck passing behind him ( there was a brief blare of horns and the passenger in the truck shot Emory W. Light the finger ) , and then left . Now it was only a matter of standing on the ramp where the restareatraffic rejoined the turnpike traffic with his thumb out ... and , he hoped , catching a ride before it started to rain . Jack spared another look around . Ugly , wretched . These words came quite naturally to mind as he looked around at the littery desolation here on the rest area 's pimply backside . It occurred to Jack that there was a feeling of death here  --  not just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep into all the country he had travelled . Jack thought that sometimes he could even see it , a desperate shade of hot dark brown , like the exhaust from the shortstack of a fast-moving JimmyPete . The new homesickness came back  --  the wanting to go to the Territoriesand see that dark blue sky , the slight curve at the edge of the horizon ... . But it plays those Jerry Bledsoe changes . Do n't know nothin bout dat . . . All I know is you seem to have this idear of " moider " a little broad . . . . Walking down to the rest area  --  now he really did have to urinate  --  Jack sneezed three times , quickly . He swallowed and winced at the hotp221prickle in his throat . Getting sick , oh yeah . Great . Not even into Indiana yet , fifty degrees , rain in the forecast , no ride , and now I'mThe thought broke off cleanly . He stared at the parking lot , his mouth falling wide open . For one awful moment he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breastbone seemed to cramp and squeeze . Sitting in one of the twenty or so slant parking spaces , its deep green surface now dulled with road-dirt , was Uncle Morgan 's BMW . No chance of a mistake ; no chance at all . California vanity plates MLS , standing for Morgan Luther Sloat . It looked as if it had been driven fast and hard . But if he flew to New Hampshire , how can his car be here ? Jack 's mind yammered . It 's a coincidence , Jack , just aThen he saw the man standing with his back to him at the pay telephone and knew it was no coincidence . He was wearing a bulky Armystyleanorak , fur-lined , a garment more suited to five below than to fifty degrees . Back-to or not , there was no mistaking those broad shoulders and that big , loose , hulking frame . The man at the phone started to turn around , crooking the phone between his ear and shoulder . Jack drew back against the brick side of the men 's toilet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , I do n't think so . ButBut Captain Farren had said that Morgan  --  that other Morgan  --  would smell him like a cat smells a rat , and so he had . From his hiding place in that dangerous forest , Jack had seen the hideous white face in the window of the diligence change . This Morgan would smell him , too . If given the time . Footfalls around the corner , approaching . Face numb and twisted with fear , Jack fumbled off his pack and then dropped it , knowing he was too late , too slow , that Morgan would come around the corner and seize him by the neck , smiling . Hi , Jacky ! Alleeallee-in-free ! Game 's over now , is n't it , you little prick ? A tall man in a houndstooth-check jacket passed the corner of the rest-room , gave Jack a disinterested glance , and went to the drinking fountain . Going back . He was going back . There was no guilt , at least not now ; only that terrible trapped fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbled his pack open . Here was Speedy 's bottle , with less than an inch of the purple liquid now left ( no boy needs dat poison to travel with but I do Speedy I do ! ) sloshing around in the bottom . No matter . He was going back . His heart leaped at the thought . A big Saturday-night grin dawned on hisp222face , denying both the gray day and the fear in his heart . Going back , oh yeah , dig it . More footsteps approaching , and this was Uncle Morgan , no doubt about that heavy yet somehow mincing step . But the fear was gone . Uncle Morgan had smelled something , but when he turned the corner he would see nothing but empty Dorito bags and crimped beercans . Jack pulled in breath  --  pulled in the greasy stink of diesel fumes and car exhausts and cold autumn air . Tipped the bottle up to his lips . Took one of the two swallows left . And even with his eyes shut he squinted as  --   |  --  the strong sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic juice he could smell something else . . . the warm smell of animals . He could hear them , too , moving all about him . Frightened , Jack opened his eyes but at first could see nothing  --  the difference in the light was so sudden and abrupt that it was as if someone had suddenly turned on a cluster of two-hundred-watt bulbs in a black room . A warm , hide-covered flank brushed by him , not in a threatening way ( or so Jack hoped ) , but most definitely in an **47;12282;TOOLONG . Jack , who had been getting up , thumped back to the ground again . " Hey ! Hey ! Get away from im ! Right here and right now ! " A loud , healthy whack followed by a disgruntled animal sound somewhere between a moo and a baa . " God 's nails ! Got no sense ! Get away from im fore I bite your God-pounding eyes out ! " Now his eyes had adjusted enough to the brightness of this almost flawless Territories autumn day to make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milling animals , whacking their sides and slightly humped backs with what appeared to be great gusto and very little real force . Jack sat up , automatically finding Speedy 's bottle with its one precious swallow left and putting it away . He never took his eyes from the young man who stood with his back to him . Tall he was  --  six-five at least , Jack guessed  --  and with shoulders so broad that his across still looked slightly out of proportion to his high . Long , greasy black hair shagged down his back to the shoulderblades . Muscles bulged and rippled as he moved amid the animals , which looked like pygmy cows . He was driving them away from Jack and toward the Western Road . He was a striking figure , even when seen from behind , but what amazed Jack was his dress . Everyone he had seen in the Territories ( including himself ) had been wearing tunics , jerkins , or rough breeches.  |p224This  fellow appeared to be wearing Oshkosh bib overalls . Then he turned around and Jack felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shot to his feet . It was the Elroy-thing . The herdsman was the Elroy-thing . Except it was n't . Jack perhaps would not have lingered to see that , and everything that happened thereafter  --  the movie theater , the shed , and the hell of the Sunlight Home  --  would not have happened ( or would , at the very least , have happened in some completely different way ) , but in the extremity of his terror he froze completely after getting up . He was no more able to run than a deer is when it is frozen in a hunter 's jacklight . As the figure in the bib overalls approached , he thought : Elroy was n't that tall or that broad . And his eyes were yellow  --  The eyes of this creature were a bright , impossible shade of orange . Looking into them was like looking into the eyes of a Halloween pumpkin . And while Elroy 's grin had promised madness and murder , the smile on this fellow 's face was large and cheerful and harmless . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes clumped into groups of three and two , barely visible through curls of wiry hair . Not hooflike , as Elroy 's had been , Jack realized , half-crazed with surprise , fear , a dawning amusement , but padlike-pawlike . As he closed the distance between himself and Jack , ( his ? its ? ) eyes flared an even brighter orange , going for a moment to the DayGloshade favored by hunters and flagmen on road-repair jobs . The color faded to a muddy hazel . As it did , Jack saw that his smile was puzzled as well as friendly , and understood two things at once : first , that there was no harm in this fellow , not an ounce of it , and second , that he was slow . Not feeble , perhaps , but slow . " Wolf ! " the big , hairy boy-beast cried , grinning . His tongue was long and pointed , and Jack thought with a shudder that a wolf was exactly what he looked like.Not a goat but a wolf . He hoped he was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I made a mistake about that , at least I wo n't have to worry about making any more mistakes . . . ever again . " Wolf ! Wolf ! " He stuck out one hand , and Jack saw that , like his feet , his hands were covered with hair , although this hair was finer and more luxuriant  --  actually quite handsome . It grew especially thick in the palms , where it was the soft white of a blaze on a horse 's forehead.  |p225My  God I think he wants to shake hands with me ! Gingerly , thinking of Uncle Tommy , who had told him he must never refuse a handshake , not even with his worst enemy ( " Fight him to the death afterward if you must , but shake his hand first , " Uncle Tommy had said ) , Jack put his own hand out , wondering if it was about to be crushed . . . or perhaps eaten . " Wolf ! Wolf ! Shakin hands right here and now ! " the boy-thing in the Oshkosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Good old Wolf ! God-pound it ! Right here and now ! Wolf ! " In spite of this enthusiasm , Wolf 's grip was gentle enough , cushioned by the crisp , furry growth of hair on his hand . Bib overalls and a big handshake from a guy who looks like an overgrown Siberian husky and smells a little bit like a hayloft after a heavy rain , Jack thought . What next ? An offer to come to his church this Sunday ? " Good old Wolf , you bet ! Good old Wolf right here and now ! " Wolf wrapped his arms around his huge chest and laughed , delighted with himself . Then he grabbed Jack 's hand again . This time his hand was pumped vigorously up and down . Something seemed required of him at this point , Jack reflected . Otherwise , this pleasant if rather simple young man might go on shaking his hand until sundown . " Good old Wolf , " he said . It seemed to be a phrase of which his new acquaintance was particularly fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . This was something of a relief . The hand had been neither crushed nor eaten , but it did feel a bit seasick . Wolf had a faster pump than a slot-machine player on a hot streak . " Stranger , ain'tcha ? " Wolf asked . He stuffed his hairy hands into the slit sides of his biballs and began playing pocket-pool with a complete lack of self-consciousness . " Yes , " Jack said , thinking of what that word meant over here . It had a very specific meaning over here . " Yes , I guess that 's just what I am . A stranger . " " God-pounding right ! I can smell it on you ! Right here and now , oh yeah , oh boy ! Got it ! Does n't smell bad , you know , but it sure is funny . Wolf ! That 's me . Wolf ! Wolf ! Wolf ! " He threw back his head and laughed . The sound ended being something that was disconcertingly like a howl . " Jack , " Jack said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and pumped with abandon . " Sawyer , " he finished , when he was released again . He smiled , feeling very much as though someone had hit him with a great big goofystick.  |p226Five  minutes ago he had been standing scrunched against the cold brick side of a shithouse on I-70 . Now he was standing here talking to a young fellow who seemed to be more animal than man . And damned if his cold was n't completely gone . " Wolf meet Jack ! Jack meet Wolf ! Here and now ! Okay ! Good ! Oh , Jason ! Cows in the road ! Ai n't they stupid ! Wolf ! Wolf ! " Yelling , Wolf loped down the hill to the road , where about half of his herd was standing , looking around with expressions of bland surprise , as if to ask where the grass had gone . They really did look like some strange cross between cows and sheep , Jack saw , and wondered what you would call such a crossbreed . The only word to come immediately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singular would be more proper in this case , as in Here 's Wolf taking care of his flock of creep . Oh yeah . Right here and now . The goofystick came down on Jack 's head again . He sat down and began to giggle , his hands crisscrossed over his mouth to stifle the sounds . Even the biggest creep stood no more than four feet high . Their fur was woolly , but of a muddy shade that was similar to Wolf 's eyes  --  at least , when Wolf 's eyes were n't blazing like Halloween jack-o ' - lanterns . Their heads were topped with short , squiggly horns that looked good for absolutely nothing . Wolf herded them back out of the road . They went obediently , with no sign of fear . If a cow or a sheep on my side of the jump got a whiff of that guy , Jack thought , it 'd kill itself trying to get out of his way . But Jack liked Wolf  --  liked him on sight , just as he had feared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt , because the comparison between the two was undeniable . Except that Elroy had been goatish while Wolf was . . . well , wolfish . Jack walked slowly toward where Wolf had set his herd to graze . He remembered tiptoeing down the stinking back hall of the Oatley Tap toward the fire-door , sensing Elroy somewhere near , smelling him , perhaps , as a cow on the other side would undoubtedly smell Wolf . He remembered the way Elroy 's hands had begun to twist and thicken , the way his neck had swelled , the way his teeth had become a mouthful of blackening fangs . " Wolf ? " Wolf turned and looked at him , smiling . His eyes flared a bright orange and looked for a moment both savage and intelligent . Then the glowp227faded and they were only that muddy , perpetually puzzled hazel again . " Are you . . . sort of a werewolf ? " " Sure am , " Wolf said , smiling . " You pounded that nail , Jack . Wolf ! " Jack sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed it would be impossible for him to be further surprised than he had already been , but Wolf managed the trick quite nicely . " How 's your father , Jack ? " he asked , in that casual , by-the-way tone reserved for enquiring after the relatives of others . " How 's Phil doing these days ? Wolf ! " Jack made a queerly apt cross-association : he felt as if all the wind had been knocked out of his mind . For a moment it just sat there in his head , not a thought in it , like a radio station broadcasting nothing but a carrier wave . Then he saw Wolf 's face change . The expression of happiness and childish curiosity was replaced by one of sorrow . Jack saw that Wolf 's nostrils were flaring rapidly . " He 's dead , is n't he ? Wolf ! I 'm sorry , Jack . God pound me ! I 'm stupid ! Stupid ! " Wolf crashed a hand into his forehead and this time he really did howl . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep looked around uneasily . " That 's all right , " Jack said . He heard his voice more in his ears than in his head , as if someone else had spoken . " But . . . how did you know ? " " Your smell changed , " Wolf said simply . " I knew he was dead because it was in your smell . Poor Phil ! What a good guy ! Tell you that right here and now , Jack ! Your father was a good guy ! Wolf ! " " Yes , " Jack said , " he was . But how did you know him ? And how did you know he was my father ? " Wolf looked at Jack as though he had asked a question so simple it barely needed answering . " I remember his smell , of course . Wolfs rememberall smells . You smell just like him . " Whack ! The goofystick came down on his head again . Jack felt an urge to just roll back and forth on the tough , springy turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he had his father 's eyes and his father 's mouth , even his father 's knack for quick-sketching , but never before had he been told that he smelled like his father . Yet he supposed the idea had a certain crazy logic , at that . " How did you know him ? " Jack asked again . Wolf looked at a loss . " He came with the other one , " he said at last . " The one from Orris . I was just little . The other one was bad . The other one stole some of us . Your father did n't know , " he added hastily , as ifp228Jack had shown anger . " Wolf ! No ! He was good , your father . Phil . The other one ... " Wolf shook his head slowly . On his face was an expression even more simple than his pleasure . It was the memory of some childhood nightmare . " Bad , " Wolf said . " He made himself a place in this world , my father says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your world . We knew he was bad , we could tell , but who listens to Wolfs ? No one . Your father knew he was bad , but he could n't smell him as good as we could . He knew he was bad , but not how bad . " And Wolf threw his head back and howled again , a long , chilly ululationof sorrow that resounded against the deep blue sky.  |p229From  the pocket of his bulky parka ( he had bought it convinced that from the Rockies east , America was a frigid wasteland after October 1st or so  --  now he was sweating rivers ) , Morgan Sloat took a small steel box . Below the latch were ten small buttons and an oblong of cloudy yellow glass a quarter of an inch high and two inches long . He pushed several of the buttons carefully with the fingernailof his left-hand pinky , and a series of numbers appeared briefly in the readout window . Sloat had bought this gadget , billed as the world 's smallest safe , in Zurich . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a week in a crematory oven would breach its carbon-steel integrity . Now it clicked open . Sloat folded back two tiny wings of ebony jeweler 's velvet , revealing something he had had for well over twenty years  --  since long before the odious little brat who was causing all this trouble had been born . It was a tarnished tin key , and once it had gone into the back of a mechanicaltoy soldier . Sloat had seen the toy soldier in the window of a junkshop in the odd little town of Point Venuti , California  --  a town in which he had a great interest . Acting under a compulsion much too strong to deny ( and he had n't even wanted to deny it , not really ; he had always made a virtue of compulsion , had Morgan Sloat ) , he had gone in and paid five dollars for the dusty , dented soldier . . . and it was n't the soldier he had wanted , anyway . It was the key that had caught his eye and then whispered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back and pocketed it as soon as he was outside the junkshop door . The soldier itself he threw in a litter-basket outside the Dangerous Planet Bookstore . Now , as Sloat stood beside his car in the Lewisburg rest area , he held the key up and looked at it . Like Jack 's croaker , the tin key became something else in the Territories . Once , when coming back , he had dropped that key in the lobby of the old office building . And there must have been some Territories magic left in it , because that idiot Jerry Bledsoe had gotten himself fried not an hour later . Had Jerry picked itp230up ? Stepped on it , perhaps ? Sloat did n't know and did n't care . Nor had he cared a tinker 's damn about Jerry  --  and considering the handyman had had an insurance policy specifying double indemnity for accidental death ( the building 's super , with whom Sloat sometimes shared a hashpipe , had passed this little tidbit on to him ) , Sloat imagined that Nita Bledsoe had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of his key . It was Phil Sawyer who had found it , giving it back to him with no comment other than " Here , Morg . Your lucky charm , is n't it ? Must have a hole in your pocket . I found it in the lobby after they took poor old Jerry away . " Yes , in the lobby . In the lobby where everything smelled like the motor of a Waring Blendor that had been running continuously on Hi Speed for about nine hours . In the lobby where everything had been blackened and twisted and fused . Except for this humble tin key . Which , in the other world , was a queer kind of lightning-rod  --  and which Sloat now hung around his neck on a fine silver chain . " Coming for you , Jacky , " said Sloat in a voice that was almost tender . " Time to bring this entire ridiculous business to a crashing halt . "  |p231Wolf  talked of many things , getting up occasionally to shoo his cattle out of the road and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west . When Jack asked him where he lived , Wolf only waved his arm vaguely northward . He lived , he said , with his family . When Jack asked for clarification a few minutes later , Wolf looked surprised and said he had no mate and no children  --  that he would not come into what he called the " big rut-moon " for another year or two . That he looked forward to the " big rut-moon " was quite obvious from the innocently lewd grin that overspread his face . " But you said you lived with your family . " " Oh , family ! Them ! Wolf ! " Wolf laughed . " Sure . Them ! We all live together . Have to keep the cattle , you know . Her cattle . " " The Queen 's ? " " Yes . May she never , never die . " And Wolf made an absurdly touching salute , bending briefly forward with his right hand touching his forehead . Further questioning straightened the matter out somewhat in Jack 's mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf was a bachelor ( although that word barely fit , somehow ) . The family of which he spoke was a hugely extended one  --  literally , the Wolf family . They were a nomadic but fiercely loyal race that moved back and forth in the great empty areas east of the Outposts but west of " The Settlements , " by which Wolf seemed to mean the towns and villages of the east . Wolfs ( never Wolves  --  when Jack once used the proper plural , Wolf had laughed until tears spurted from the corners of his eyes ) were solid , dependable workers , for the most part . Their strength was legendary , their courage unquestioned . Some of them had gone east into The Settlements , where they served the Queen as guards , soldiers , even as personal bodyguards . Their lives , Wolf explained to Jack , had only two great touchstones : the Lady and the family . Most of the Wolfs , he said , served the Lady as he did  --  watching the herds . The cow-sheep were the Territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lamp-oil ( Wolf did not tell Jack this , but Jack inferred it from what he said ) . All the cattle belonged to the Queen , and the Wolf family had been watching over them since time out of mind . It was their job . In this Jack found an oddly persuasive correlative to the relationship that had existed between the buffalo and the Indians of the American Plains . . . at least until the white man had come into those territories and upset the balance . " Behold , and the lion shall lie down with the lamb , and the Wolf with the creep , " Jack murmured , and smiled . He was lying on his back with his hands laced behind his head . The most marvellous feeling of peace and ease had stolen over him . " What , Jack ? " " Nothing , " he said . " Wolf , do you really change into an animal when the moon gets full ? " " ' Course I do ! " Wolf said . He looked astounded , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really pull up your pants after you finish taking a crap ? " Strangers do n't , do they ? Phil told me that . " " The , ah , herd , " Jack said . " When you change , do they  --  " " Oh , we do n't go near the herd when we change , " Wolf said seriously . " Good Jason , no ! We 'd eat them , do n't you know that ? And a Wolf who eats of his herd must be put to death . The Book of Good Farming says so . Wolf ! Wolf ! We have places to go when the moon is full . So does the herd . They 're stupid , but they know they have to go away at the time of the big moon . Wolf ! They better know , God pound them ! " " But you do eat meat , do n't you ? " Jack asked . " Full of questions , just like your father , " Wolf said . " Wolf ! I do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . We 're Wolfs , are n't we ? " " But if you do n't eat from the herds , what do you eat ? " " We eat well , " Wolf said , and would say no more on that subject . Like everything else in the Territories , Wolf was a mystery  --  a mystery that was both gorgeous and frightening . The fact that he had known both Jack 's father and Morgan Sloat  --  had , at least , met their Twinners on more than one occasion  --  contributed to Wolf 's particular aura of mystery , but did not define it completely . Everything Wolf told him led Jack to a dozen more questions , most of which Wolf could n't  --  or would n't  --  answer . The matter of Philip Sawtelle 's and Orris 's visits was a case in point . They had first appeared when Wolf was in the " little moon " and living with his mother and two " litter-sisters . " They were apparently just passing through , as Jack himself was now doing , only they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the truth , you 're just about the only human I 've ever seen this far west who was still going west , " Wolf said ) .  |p233They  had been jolly enough company , both of them . It was only later that there had been trouble . . . trouble with Orris . That had been after the partner of Jack 's father had " made himself a place in this world , " Wolf told Jack again and again  --  only now he seemed to mean Sloat , in the physical guise of Orris . Wolf said that Morgan had stolen one of his litter-sisters ( " My mother bit her hands and toes for a month after she knew for certain that he took her , " Wolf told Jack matter-of-factly ) and had taken other Wolfs from time to time . Wolf dropped his voice and , with an expression of fear and superstitious awe on his face , told Jack that the " limping man " had taken some of these Wolfs into the other world , the Place of the Strangers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's very bad for guys like you , is n't it ? " Jack asked . " They 're damned , " Wolf replied simply . Jack had thought at first that Wolf was speaking of kidnapping  --  the verb Wolf had used in connection with his litter-sister , after all , was the Territories version of take . He began to see now that kidnapping was n't what was going on at all  --  unless Wolf , with unconscious poetry , had been trying to say that Morgan had kidnapped the minds of some of the Wolf family . Jack now thought that Wolf was really talking about werewolves who had thrown over their ancient allegiance to the Crown and the herd and had given it to Morgan instead . . . Morgan Sloat and Morgan of Orris . Which led naturally enough to thoughts of Elroy . A Wolf who eats of his herd must be put to death . To thoughts of the men in the green car who had stopped to ask him directions , and offered him a Tootsie Roll , and who had then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eyes had changed . They 're damned . He made himself a place in this world . Until now he had felt both safe and delighted : delighted to be back in the Territories where there was a nip in the air but nothing like the dull , cold gray bite of western Ohio , safe with big , friendly Wolf beside him , way out in the country , miles from anything or anyone . Made himself a place in this world . He asked Wolf about his father  --  Philip Sawtelle in this world  --  but Wolf only shook his head . He had been a God-pounding good guy , and a Twinner  --  thus obviously a Stranger  --  but that was all Wolf seemed to know . Twinners , he said , was something that had something to do with litters of people , and about such business he could not presume to say . Nor could he describe Philip Sawtelle  --  he did n't remember . He only remembered the smell . All he knew , he told Jack , was that , whilep234both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really been nice . Once he had brought presents for Wolf and his litter-sisters and litter-brothers . One of the presents , unchanged from the world of the Strangers , had been a set of bib overalls for Wolf . " I wore em all the time , " Wolf said . " My mother wanted to throw em away after I 'd wore em for five years or so . Said they were worn out ! Said I was too big for them ! Wolf ! Said they were only patches holding more patches together . I would n't give em up , though . Finally , she bought some cloth from a drummer headed out toward the Outposts . I do n't know how much she paid , and Wolf ! I 'll tell you the truth , Jack , I 'm afraid to ask . She dyed it blue and made me six pairs . The ones your father brought me , I sleep on them now . Wolf ! Wolf ! It 's my Godpoundingpillow , I guess . " Wolf smiled so openly  --  and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . It was something he never could have done in his old life , no matter what the circumstances , but that now seemed like his loss . He was glad to take Wolf 's warm , strong hand . " I 'm glad you liked my dad , Wolf , " he said . " I did ! I did ! Wolf ! Wolf ! " And then all hell broke loose . Wolf stopped talking and looked around , startled . " Wolf ? What 's wr  --  " " Shhhh ! " Then Jack heard it . Wolf 's more sensitive ears had picked the sound up first , but it swelled quickly ; before long , a deaf man would have heard it , Jack thought . The cattle looked around and then began to move away from the source of the sound in a rough , uneasy clot . It was like a radio sound-effect where someone is supposed to be ripping a bedsheet down the middle , very slowly . Only the volume kept going up and up and up until Jack thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , looking stunned and confused and frightened . That ripping sound , a low , ragged purr , continued to grow . The bleating of the cattle became louder . Some were backing into the stream , and as Jack looked that way he saw one go down with a splash and a clumsy flailing of legs . It had been pushed over by its milling , retreating comrades . It let out a shrill , baaa-ing cry . Another cow-sheep stumbled over it and was likewise trampled into the water by the slow retreat . The far side of the stream was low and wet , green with reeds , muddy-marshy . The cow-sheep who first reached this muck quickly became mired in it.  | " Oh you God pounding good-for-nothing cattle ! " Wolf bellowed , and charged down the hill toward the stream , where the first animal to fall over now looked as if it were in its death-throes . " Wolf ! " Jack shouted , but Wolf could n't hear him . Jack could barely hear himself over that ragged ripping sound . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stream , and gaped with amazement . Somethingwas happening to the air . A patch of it about three feet off the ground was rippling and blistering , seeming to twist and pull at itself . Jack could see the Western Road through this patch of air , but the road seemed blurry and shimmery , as if seen through the heated , rippling air over an incinerator . Something 's pulling the air open like a wound  --  something 's coming through  --  from our side ? Oh Jason , is that what I do when I come through ? But even in his own panic and confusion he knew it was not . Jack had a good idea who would come through like this , like a rape in progress . Jack began to run down the hill . The ripping sound went on and on and on . Wolf was down on his knees in the stream , trying to help the second downed animal to its feet . The first floated limply downstream , its body tattered and mangled . " Get up ! God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slapped as best he could at the cow-sheep who milled and backed into him , then got both arms around the drowning animal 's midriff and pulled upward . " WOLF ! HERE AND NOW ! " he screamed . The sleeves of his shirt split wide open along the biceps , reminding Jack of David Banner having one of the gamma-ray-inspired tantrums that turned him into The Incredible Hulk . Water sprayed everywhere and Wolf lurched to his feet , eyes blazing orange , blue overalls now soaked black . Water streamed from the nostrils of the animal , which Wolf held clutched against his chest as if it were an overgrown puppy . Its eyes were turned up to sticky whites . " Wolf ! " Jack screamed . " It 's Morgan ! It 's  --  " " The herd ! " Wolf screamed back . " Wolf ! Wolf ' My God pounding herd ! Jack ! Do n't try  --  " The rest was drowned out by a grinding clap of thunder that shook the earth . For a moment the thunder even covered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf 's cattle , Jack looked up and saw a clear blue sky , innocent of clouds save for a few puffy white ones that were miles away . The thunder ignited outright panic in Wolf 's herd . They tried to bolt ,  |p236but  in their exquisite stupidity , many of them tried to do it by backing up . They crashed and splashed and were rolled underwater . Jack heard the bitter snap of a breaking bone , followed by the baaaa-ing scream of an animal in pain . Wolf bellowed in rage , dropped the cow-sheep he had been trying to save , and floundered toward the muddy far bank of the stream . Before he could get there , half a dozen cattle struck him and bore him down . Water splashed and flew in thin , bright sprays . Now , Jack saw , Wolf was the one in danger of being simultaneously trampled and drowned by the stupid , fleeing animals . Jack pushed into the stream , which was now dark with roiling mud . The current tried continually to push him off-balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past him , almost knocking him down . Water sprayed into his face and Jack tried to wipe it out of his eyes . Now that sound seemed to fill the whole world : RRRRRIIIPPPPWolf . Never mind Morgan , at least not for the moment . Wolf was in trouble . His shaggy , drenched head was momentarily visible above the water , and then three of the animals ran right over him and Jack could only see one waving , fur-covered hand . He pushed forward again , trying to weave through the cattle , some still up , others floundering and drowning underfoot . Jack ! " A voice bellowed over that ripping noise . It was a voice Jack knew . Uncle Morgan 's voice . Jack ! " There was another clap of thunder , this one a huge oaken thud that rolled through the sky like an artillery shell . Panting , his soaked hair hanging in his eyes , Jack looked over his shoulder ... and directly into the rest area on I-70 near Lewisburg , Ohio . He was seeing it as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was seeing it . The edge of the brick toilet was on the left side of that blistered , tortured patch of air . The snout of what looked like a Chevroletpick-up truck was on the right , floating three feet above the field where he and Wolf had been sitting peacefully and talking not five minutes ago . And in the center , looking like an extra in a film about Admiral Byrd 's assault on the South Pole , was Morgan Sloat , his thick red face twisted with murderous rage . Rage , and something else . Triumph ? Yes . Jack thought that was what it was . He stood at midstream in water that was crotch-deep , cattle passing on either side of him , baa-ing and bleating , staring at that window which had been torn in the very fabric of reality , his eyes wide , his mouth wider.  |p237He  's found me , oh dear God , he 's found me . " There you are , you little shithead ! " Morgan bellowed at him . His voice carried , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the reality of that world into the reality of this one . It was like listening to a man shout inside a telephone booth . " Now we 'll see , wo n't we ? Wo n't we ? " Morgan started forward , his face swimming and rippling as if made of limp plastic , and Jack had time to see there was something clutched in his hand , something hung around his neck , something small and silvery . Jack stood , paralyzed , as Sloat bulled his way through the hole between the two universes . As he came he did his own werewolf number , changing from Morgan Sloat , investor , land speculator , and sometime Hollywood agent , into Morgan of Orris , pretender to the throne of a dying Queen . His flushed , hanging jowls thinned . The color faded out of them . His hair renewed itself , growing forward , first tinting the rondureof his skull , as if some invisible being were coloring Uncle Morgan 's head , then covering it . The hair of Sloat 's Twinner was long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tied at the nape of his neck , Jack saw , but most of it had come loose . The parka wavered , disappeared for a moment , then came back as a cloak and hood . Morgan Sloat 's suede boots became dark leather kneeboots , their tops turned down , what might have been the hilt of a knife poking out of one . And the small silvery thing in his hand had turned to a small rod tipped with crawling blue fire . It 's a lightning-rod . Oh Jesus , it 's a " Jack ! " The cry was low , gargling , full of water . Jack whirled clumsily around in the stream , barely avoiding another cow-sheep , this one floating on its side , dead in the water . He saw Wolf 's head going down again , both hands waving . Jack fought his way toward those hands , still dodging the cattle as best he could . One of them bunted his hip hard and Jack went over , inhaling water . He got up again quick , coughing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , afraid it might have washed away . It was still there . " Boy ! Turn around and look at me , boy ! " No time just now , Morgan . Sorry , but I 've got to see if I can avoid getting drowned by Wolf 's herd before I see if I can avoid getting fried by your doomstickthere . IBlue fire arched over Jack 's shoulder , sizzling  --  it was like a deadly electric rainbow . It struck one of the cow-sheep caught in the reedy muck on the other side of the stream and the unfortunate beast simplyp238exploded , as if it had swallowed dynamite . Blood flew in a needle-spray of droplets . Gobbets of flesh began to rain down around Jack . " Turn and look at me , boy ! " He could feel the force of that command , gripping his face with invisiblehands , trying to turn it . Wolf struggled up again , his hair plastered against his face , his dazed eyes peering through a curtain of it like the eyes of an English sheepdog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where he was . " Wolf ! " Jack screamed , but thunder exploded across the blue sky again , drowning him out . Wolf bent over and retched up a great muddy sheet of water . A moment later another of the terrified cow-sheep struck him and bore him under again . That 's it , Jack thought despairingly . That 's it , he 's gone , must be , let him go , get out of hereBut he struggled on toward Wolf , pushing a dying , weakly convulsing cow-sheep out of his way to get there . Jason ! " Morgan of Orris screamed , and Jack realized that Morgan was not cursing in the Territories argot ; he was calling his , Jack 's , name . Only here he was not Jack . Here he was Jason . But the Queen 's son died an infant , died , heThe wet , sizzling zap of electricity again , seeming almost to part his hair . Again it struck the other bank , this time vaporizing one of Wolf 's cattle . No , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs were still there , mired in the mud like shakepoles . As he watched , they began to sag tiredly outward in four different directions . " TURN AND LOOK AT ME , GOD POUND YOU ! " The water , why does n't he throw it at the water , fry me , Wolf , all these animals at the same time ? Then his fifth-grade science came back to him . Once electricity went to water , it could go anywhere . . . including back to the generator of the current . Wolf 's dazed face , floating underwater , drove these thoughts from Jack 's flying mind . Wolf was still alive , but partially pinned under a cowsheep , which , although apparently unhurt , had frozen in panic . Wolf 's hands waved with pathetic , flagging energy . As Jack closed the last of the distance , one of those hands dropped and simply floated , limp as a water-lily . Without slowing , Jack lowered his left shoulder and hit the cow-sheep like Jack Armstrong in a boy 's sports story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territories compact model ,  |p239Jack  would probably not have budged it , not with the stream 's fairly stiff current working against him . But it was smaller than a cow , and Jack was pumped up . It bawled when Jack hit it , floundered backward , sat briefly on its haunches , and then lunged for the far bank . Jack grabbed Wolf 's hands and pulled with all of his might . Wolf came up as reluctantly as a waterlogged tree-trunk , his eyes now glazed and half-closed , water streaming from his ears and nose and mouth . His lips were blue . Twin forks of lightning blazed to the right and left of where Jack stood holding Wolf , the two of them looking like a pair of drunks trying to waltz in a swimming pool . On the far bank , another cow-sheep flew in all directions , its severed head still bawling . Hot rips of fire zigzagged through the marshy area , lighting the reeds on the tussocks and then finding the drier grass of the field where the land began to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf , for Christ 's sake ! " " Auh , " Wolf moaned , and vomited warm muddy water over Jack 's shoulder . " Auhhhhhhhhhhh ... " Now Jack saw Morgan standing on the other bank , a tall , Puritanical figure in his black cloak . His hood framed his pallid , vampirelike face with a kind of cheerless romance . Jack had time to think that the Territorieshad worked their magic even here , on behalf of his dreadful uncle . Over here , Morgan was not an overweight , hypertensive actuarial toad with piracy in his heart and murder in his mind ; over here , his face had narrowed and found a frigid masculine beauty . He pointed the silver rod like a toy magic wand , and blue fire tore the air open . " Now you and your dumb friend ! " Morgan screamed . His thin lips split in a triumphant grin , revealing sunken yellow teeth that spoiled Jack 's blurred impression of beauty once and forever . Wolf screamed and jerked in Jack 's aching arms . He was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear . " You , devil ! " Wolf screamed . " You , devil ! My sister ! My litter-sister ! Wolf ' Wolf ! You , devil/ " Jack pulled the bottle out of his jerkin . There was a single swallow left anyway . He could n't hold Wolf up with his one arm ; he was losing him , and Wolf seemed unable to support himself . Did n't matter . Could n't take him back through into the other world anyway . . . or could he ? " You , devil ! " Wolf screamed , weeping , his wet face sliding down Jack 's arm . The back of his bib overalls floated and belled in the water . Smell of burning grass and burning animals . Thunder , exploding . This time the river of fire in the air rushed by Jack so close that the hairs in his nostrils singed and curled.  | " OH YES , BOTH OF YOU , BOTH OF YOU ! " Morgan howled . " I 'LL TEACH YOU TO GET IN MY WAY , YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'LL POUND YOU DOWN ! " " Wolf , hold on ! " Jack yelled . He gave up his effort to hold Wolf up ; instead , he snatched Wolf 's hand in his own and held it as tightly as he could . " Hold on to me , do you hear ? " " Wolf ! " He tipped the bottle up , and the awful cold taste of rotted grapes filled his mouth for the last time . The bottle was empty . As he swallowed , he heard it shatter as one of Morgan 's bolts of lightning struck it . But the sound of the breaking glass was faint . . . the tingle of electricity ... even Morgan 's screams of rage . He felt as if he were falling over backward into a hole . A grave , maybe . Then Wolf 's hand squeezed down on Jack 's so hard that Jack groaned . That feeling of vertigo , of having done a complete dipsydoodle , began to fade . . . and then the sunlight faded , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heartland of America . Cold rain struck Jack in the face , and he was faintly aware that the water he was standing in seemed much colder than it had only seconds ago . Somewhere not far away he could hear the familiar snoring drone of the big rigs on the interstate . . . except that now they seemed to be coming from directly overhead . Impossible , he thought , but was it ? The bounds of that word seemed to be stretching with plastic ease . For one dizzy moment he had an image of flying Territories trucks driven by flying Territories men with big canvas wings strapped to their backs . Back , he thought . Back again , same time , same turnpike . He sneezed . Same cold , too . But two things were not the same now . No rest area here . They were standing thigh-deep in the icy water of a stream beneath a turnpike overpass . Wolf was with him . That was the other change . And Wolf was screaming.  |p241Overhead  , another truck pounded across the overpass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf wailed and clutched at Jack , almost knocking them both into the water . " Quit it ! " Jack shouted . " Let go of me , Wolf ! It 's just a truck ! Letgo ! " He slapped at Wolf , not wanting to do it  --  Wolf 's terror was pathetic . But , pathetic or not , Wolf had the best part of a foot and maybe a hundred and fifty pounds on Jack , and if he overbore him , they would both go into this freezing water and it would be pneumonia for sure . " Wolff Do n't like it ! Wolf ! Do n't like it ! Wolf ! Wolf ! " But his hold slackened . A moment later his arms dropped to his sides . When another truck snored by overhead , Wolf cringed but managed to keep from grabbing Jack again . But he looked at Jack with a mute , trembling appeal that said Get me out of this , please get me out of this , I 'd rather be dead than in this world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over there . Even if he were n't , 1 do n't have the magic juice anymore . He looked down at his left hand and saw he was holding the jagged neck of Speedy 's bottle , like a man getting ready to do some serious barroom brawling . Just dumb luck Wolf had n't gotten a bad cut when he grabbed Jack in his terror . Jack tossed it away . Splash . Two trucks this time  --  the noise was doubled . Wolf howled in terror and plastered his hands over his ears . Jack could see that most of the hair had disappeared from Wolf 's hands in the flip  --  most , but not all . And , he saw , the first two fingers of each of Wolf 's hands were exactly the same length . " Come on , Wolf , " Jack said when the racket of the trucks had faded a little . " Let 's get out of here . We look like a couple of guys waiting to get baptized on a PTL Club special . " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Wolf'sp242grip closed down . Wolf saw his expression and loosened up . . . a little . " Do n't leave me , Jack , " Wolf said . " Please , please do n't leave me . " " No , Wolf , I wo n't , " Jack said . He thought : How do you get into these things , you asshole ? Here you are , standing under a turnpike overpass somewhere in Ohio with your pet werewolf How do you do it ? Do you practice ? And , oh , by the way , what 's happening with the moon , Jack-O ? Do you remember ? He did n't , and with clouds blanketing the sky and a cold rain falling , there was no way to tell . What did that make the odds ? Thirty to one in his favor ? Twentyeightto two ? Whatever the odds were , they were n't good enough . Not the way things were going . " No , I wo n't leave you , " he repeated , and then led Wolf toward the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decayed remains of some child 's dolly floated belly-up , her glassy blue eyes staring into the growingdark . The muscles of Jack 's arm ached from the strain of pulling Wolf through into this world , and the joint in his shoulder throbbed like a rotted tooth . As they came out of the water onto the weedy , trashy bank , Jack began to sneeze again . This time , Jack 's total progress in the Territories had been half a mile west  --  the distance Wolf had moved his herd so they could drink in the stream where Wolf himself had later almost been drowned . Over here , he found himself ten miles farther west , as best he could figure . They struggled up the bank  --  Wolf actually ended up pulling Jack most of the way  --  and in the last of the daylight Jack could see an exit-ramp splitting off to the right some fifty yards up the road . A reflectorized sign read : ARCANUM LAST EXIT IN OHIO STATE LINE 1 5 MILES . " We 've got to hitch , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's have a look at you . " He thought Wolf would do , at least in the dark . He was still wearing the bib overalls , which now had an actual OSHKOSH label on them . His homespun shirt had become a machine-produced blue chambray that looked like an Army-Navy Surplus special . His formerly bare feet were clad in a huge pair of dripping penny loafers and white socks . Oddest of all , a pair of round steel-rimmed spectacles of the sort John Lennon used to wear sat in the middle of Wolf 's big face.  | " Wolf , did you have trouble seeing ? Over in the Territories ? " " I did n't know I did , " Wolf said . " I guess so . Wolf ! I sure see better over here , with these glass eyes . Wolf , right here and now ! " He looked out at the roaring turnpike traffic , and for just a moment Jack saw what he must be seeing : great steel beasts with huge yellow-white eyes , snarlingthrough the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see better than I want to , " Wolf finished forlornly. .. 3 .. Two days later a pair of tired , footsore boys limped past the MUNICIPAL TOWN LIMITS sign on one side of Highway 32 and the 10-4 Diner on the other side , and thus into the city of Muncie , Indiana . Jack was running a fever of a hundred and two degrees and coughing pretty steadily . Wolf 's face was swollen and discolored . He looked like a pug that has come out on the short end in a grudge match . The day before , he had tried to get them some late apples from a tree growing in the shade of an abandoned barn beside the road . He had actually been in the tree and dropping shrivelled autumn apples into the front of his overalls when the wall-wasps , which had built their nest somewhere in the eaves of the old barn , had found him . Wolf had come back down the tree as fast as he could , with a brown cloud around his head . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his nose beginning to resemble a large purple turnip , he had insisted that Jack have the best of the apples . None of them was very good  --  small and sour and wormy  --  and Jack did n't feel much like eating anyway , but after what Wolf had gone through to get them , he had n't had the heart to refuse . A big old Camaro , jacked in the back so that the nose pointed at the road , blasted by them . " Heyyyyy , assholes ! " someone yelled , and there was a burst of loud , beer-fueled laughter . Wolf howled and clutched at Jack . Jack had thought that Wolf would eventually get over his terror of cars , but now he was really beginning to wonder . " It 's all right , Wolf , " he said wearily , peeling Wolf 's arms off for the twentieth or thirtieth time that day . " They 're gone . " " So loud ! " Wolf moaned . " Wolf ! Wolf ! Wolf ! So loud , Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jack said , thinking wearily : You 'd love the Californiafreeways , Wolf . We 'll check those out if we 're still travelling together , okay ? Then we 'll try a few stock-car races and motorcycle scrambles . You 'll he nuts about them . " Some guys like the sound , you know . They  --  " Butp244he went into another coughing fit that doubled him over . For a moment the world swam away in gray shades . It came back very , very slowly . " Like it , " Wolf muttered . " Jason ! How could anyone like it , Jack ? And the smells ... " Jack knew that , for Wolf , the smells were the worst . They had n't been over here four hours before Wolf began to call it the Country of Bad Smells . That first night Wolf had retched half a dozen times , at first throwing up muddy water from a stream which existed in another universeonto the Ohio ground , then simply dry-heaving . It was the smells , he explained miserably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how anyone could stand them . Jack knew  --  coming back from the Territories , you were bowled over by odors you barely noticed when you were living with them . Diesel fuel , car exhausts , industrial wastes , garbage , bad water , ripe chemicals . Then you got used to them again . Got used to them or just went numb . Only that was n't happening to Wolf . He hated the cars , he hated the smells , he hated this world . Jack did n't think he was ever going to get used to it . If he did n't get Wolf back into the Territoriesfairly soon , Jack thought he might go crazy . He 'll probably drive me crazy while he 's at it , Jack thought . Not that I 've got far to go anymore . A clattering farm-truck loaded with chickens ground by them , followed by an impatient line of cars , some of them honking . Wolf almost jumped into Jack 's arms . Weakened by the fever , Jack reeled into the brushy , trash-littered ditch and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , Jack , " Wolf said miserably . " God pound me ! " " Not your fault , " Jack said . " Fall out . Time to take five . " Wolf sat down beside Jack , remaining silent , looking at Jack anxiously . He knew how hard he was making it for Jack ; he knew that Jack was in a fever to move faster , partly to outdistance Morgan , but mostly for some other reason . He knew that Jack moaned about his mother in his sleep , and sometimes cried . But the only time he had cried when awake was after Wolf went a little crazy on the Arcanum turnpike ramp . That was when he realized what Jack meant by " hitching . " When Wolf told Jack he did n't think he could hitch rides  --  at least not for a while and maybe not ever Jack had sat down on the top strand of guardrail cable and had wept into his hands . And then he had stopped , which was good . . . but when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Wolf in a way that made Wolf feel sure that Jack would leave him in this horrible Country of Bad Smells . . . and without Jack , Wolf would soon go quite mad.  |p245They  had walked up to the Arcanum exit in the breakdown lane , Wolf cringing and pawing at Jack each time a car or truck passed in the deepening dusk . Jack had heard a mocking voice drift back on the slipstream : " Where 's your car , faggots ? " He shook it off like a dog shaking water out of his eyes , and had simply kept going , taking Wolf 's hand and pulling him after when Wolf showed signs of lagging or drifting toward the woods . The important thing was to get off the turnpike proper , where hitchhiking was forbidden , and onto the westbound Arcanum entrance ramp . Some states had legalized hitching from the ramps ( or so a road-bum with whom Jack had shared a barn one night had told him ) , and even in states where thumbing was technically a crime , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So first , get to the ramp . Hope no state patrol happened along while you were getting there . What a state trooper might make of Wolf Jack did n't want to think about . He would probably think he had caught an eighties incarnation of Charles Manson in Lennon glasses . They made the ramp and crossed over to the westbound lane . Ten minutes later a battered old Chrysler had pulled up . The driver , a burly man with a bull neck and a cap which read CASE FARM EQUIPMENT tipped back on his head , leaned over and opened the door . " Hop in , boys ! Dirty night , ai n't it ? " " Thanks , mister , it sure is , " Jack said cheerfully . His mind was in overdrive , trying to figure out how he could work Wolf into the Story , and he barely noticed Wolf 's expression . The man noticed it , however . His face hardened . " You smell anything bad , son ? " Jack was snapped back to reality by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . All cordiality had departed it , and he looked as if he might have just wandered into the Oatley Tap to eat a few beers and drink a few glasses . Jack whipped around and looked ut Wolf . Wolf 's nostrils were flaring like the nostrils of a bear which smells a blown skunk . His lips were not just pulled back from his teeth ; they were wrinkled back from them , the flesh below his nose stacked in little ridges . " What is he , retarded ? " the man in the CASE FARM EQUIPMENT hat asked Jack in a low voice . " No , ah , he just  --  "  |p246Wolf  began to growl . That was it . " Oh , Christ , " the man said in the tones of one who simply can not believe this is happening . He stepped on the gas and roared down the exit ramp , the passenger door flopping shut . His taillights dot-dashed briefly in the rainy dark at the foot of the ramp , sending reflections in smeary red arrows up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great , " Jack said , and turned to Wolf , who shrank back from his anger . " That 's just great ! If he 'd had a CB radio , he 'd be on Channel Nineteen right now , yelling for a cop , telling anyone and everyonethat there are a couple of loonies trying to hitch a ride out of Arcanum ! Jason ! Or Jesus ! Or Whoever , I do n't care ! You want to see some fucking nails get pounded , Wolf ? You do that a few more times and you 'll feel them get pounded ! Us ! We 'll get pounded ! " Exhausted , bewildered , frustrated , almost used up , Jack advanced on the cringing Wolf , who could have torn his head from his shoulders with one hard , swinging blow if he had wanted to , and Wolf backed up before him . " Do n't shout , Jack , " he moaned . " The smells . . . to be in there . . . shut up in there with those smells ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted . His voice broke , his sore throat hurt more than ever , but he could n't seem to stop ; it was shout or go mad . His wet hair had fallen in his eyes . He shook it away and then slapped Wolf on the shoulder . There was a smart crack and his hand began to hurt at once . It was as if he had slapped a stone . Wolf howled abjectly , and this made Jack angrier . The fact that he was lying made him angrier still . He had been in the Territories less than six hours this time , but that man 's car had smelled like a wild animal 's den . Harsh aromas of old coffee and fresh beer ( there had been an open can of Stroh 's between his legs ) , an air-freshener hanging from the rear-view mirror that smelled like dry sweet powder on the cheek of a corpse . And there had been something else , something darker , something wetter .. . " Not anything ! " he shouted , his voice breaking hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and turned around , hunching like a child who is being beaten by an angry father . Jack began to slap at his back , his smarting hands spatting up little sprays of water from Wolf 's overalls . Each time Jack 's hand descended , Wolf howled . " So you better get used to it ( Slap ! ) because the next car to come along might be a cop ( Slap ! ) or it might be Mr. Morgan Bloat in his puke-green BMW ( Slap ! ) and if all you can be is a big baby , we 're going to be in one big fucking world of hurt ! ( Slap ! ) Do you understand that ? "  |p247Wolf  said nothing . He stood hunched in the rain , his back to Jack , quivering . Crying . Jack felt a lump rise in his own throat , felt his eyes grow hot and stinging . All of this only increased his fury . Some terrible part of him wanted most of all to hurt himself , and knew that hurting Wolf was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Wolf did . Tears ran from his muddy brown eyes behind the round spectacles . Snot ran from his nose . " Do you understand me ? " " Yes , " Wolf moaned . " Yes , I understand , but I could n't ride with him , Jack . " " Why not ? " Jack looked at him angrily , fisted hands on his hips . Oh , his head was aching . " Because he was dying , " Wolf said in a low voice . Jack stared at him , all his anger draining away . " Jack , did n't you know ? " Wolf asked softly . " Wolf ! You could n't smell it ? " " No , " Jack said in a small , whistling , out-of-breath voice . Because he had smelled something , had n't he ? Something he had never smelled before . Something like a mixture of .. . It came to him , and suddenly his strength was gone . He sat down heavily on the guardrail cable and looked at Wolf . Shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been like . That was n't it a hundred per cent , but it was too hideously close . Shit and rotting grapes . " It 's the worst smell , " Wolf said . " It 's when people forget how to be healthy . We call it  --  Wolf !  --  the Black Disease . I do n't even think he knew he had it . And . . . these Strangers ca n't smell it , can they , Jack ? " " No , " he whispered . If he were to be suddenly teleported back to New Hampshire , to his mother 's room in the Alhambra , would he smell that stink on her ? Yes . He would smell it on his mother , drifting out of her pores , the smell of shit and rotting grapes , the Black Disease . " We call it cancer , " Jack whispered . We call it cancer and my mother has it . " I just do n't know if I can hitch , " Wolf said . " I 'll try again if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . . . they 're bad enough in the outside air , Wolf ! but inside ... " That was when Jack put his face in his hands and wept , partly out of desperation , mostly out of simple exhaustion . And , yes , the expression Wolf believed he had seen on Jack 's face really had been there ; for an instant the temptation to leave Wolf was more than a temptation , it wasp248a maddening imperative . The odds against his ever making it to Californiaand finding the Talisman  --  whatever it might be  --  had been long before ; now they were so long they dwindled to a point on the horizon . Wolf would do more than slow him down ; Wolf would sooner or later get both of them thrown in jail . Probably sooner . And how could he ever explain Wolf to Rational Richard Sloat ? What Wolf saw on Jack 's face in that moment was a look of cold speculation that unhinged his knees . He fell on them and held his clasped hands up to Jack like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away an ' leave me , Jack , " he wept . " Do n't leave old Wolf , do n't leave me here , you brought me here , please , please do n't leave me alone .... " Beyond this , conscious words were lost ; Wolf was perhaps trying to talk but all he really seemed able to do was sob . Jack felt a great weariness fall over him . It fit well , like a jacket that one has worn often . Do n't leave me here , you brought me here ... . There it was . Wolf was his responsibility , was n't he ? Yes . Oh yes indeed . He had taken Wolf by the hand and dragged him out of the Territories and into Ohio and he had the throbbing shoulder to prove it . He had had no choice , of course ; Wolf had been drowning , and even if he had n't drowned , Morgan would have crisped him with whatever that lightning-rod thing had been . So he could have turned on Wolf again , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy ? To be here and scared , or there and dead ? He could , yes , and Wolf would have no answer because Wolf was n't too swift in the brains department . But Uncle Tommy had been fond of quoting a Chinese proverb that went : The man whose life you save is your responsibility for the rest of your life . Never mind the ducking , never mind the fancy footwork ; Wolf was his responsibility . " Do n't leave me , Jack , " Wolf wept . " Wolf-Wolf ! Please do n't leave good old Wolf , I 'll help you , I 'll stand guard at night , I can do lots , only do n't do n't  --  " " Quit bawling and get up , " Jack said quietly . " I wo n't leave you . But we 've got to get out of here in case that guy does send a cop back to check on us . Let 's move it . " " Did you figure out what to do next , Jack ? " Wolf asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over the Muncie town line for more than half an hour , and when Jack turned toward Wolf , Wolf was relieved to see he was smiling . It was a weary smile , and Wolf didn'tp249like the dark , tired circles under Jack 's eyes ( he liked Jack 's smell even less  --  it was a sick smell ) , but it was a smile . " I think I see what we should do next right over there , " Jack said . " I was thinking about it just a few days ago , when I got my new sneakers . " He bowed his feet . He and Wolf regarded the sneakers in depressed silence . They were scuffed , battered , and dirty . The left sole was bidding a fond adieu to the left upper . Jack had owned them for ... he wrinkled his forehead and thought . The fever made it hard to think . Three days . Only three days since he had picked them out of the bargain bin of the Fayva store . Now they looked old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brightened . " See that building over there , Wolf ? " The building , an explosion of uninteresting angles in gray brick , stood like an island in the middle of a giant parking lot . Wolf knew what the asphalt in that parking lot would smell like : dead , decomposing animals . That smell would almost suffocate him , and Jack would barely notice it . " For your information , the sign there says Town Line Sixplex , " Jack said . " It sounds like a coffee pot , but actually it 's a movie with six shows . There ought to be one we like . " And in the afternoon , there wo n't be many people there and that 's good because you have this distressing habit of going Section Eight , Wolf . " Come on . " He got unsteadily to his feet . " What 's a movie , Jack ? " Wolf asked . He had been a dreadful problem to Jack , he knew  --  such a dreadful problem that he now hesitated to protest about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to him : that going to a movie and hitching a ride might be the same thing . Jack called the roaring carts and carriages " cars , " and " Chevys , " and " Jartrans , " and " station-wagons " ( these latter , Wolf thought , must be like the coaches in the Territories which carried passengers from one coach-station to the next ) . Might the bellowing , stinking carriagesalso be called " movies " ? It sounded very possible . " Well , " Jack said , " it 's easier to show you than to tell you . I think you 'll like it . Come on . " Jack stumbled coming out of the ditch and went briefly to his knees . " Jack , are you okay ? " Wolf asked anxiously . Jack nodded . They started across the parking lot , which smelled just as bad as Wolf had known it would . Jack had come a good part of the thirty-five miles between Arcanum , Ohio , and Muncie , Indiana , on Wolf 's broad back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nauseated by the smells of almost everything ,  |p250a|pt  to howl and run at sudden loud noises . But he was also almost tireless . As far as that goes , you can strike the " almost , " Jack thought now . So far as I know , he is tireless . Jack had moved them away from the Arcanum ramp as fast as he could , forcing his wet , aching legs into a rusty trot . His head had been throbbing like a slick , flexing fist inside his skull , waves of heat and cold rushing through him . Wolf moved easily to his left , his stride so long that he was keeping up with Jack easily by doing no more than a moderatelyfast walk . Jack knew that he had maybe gotten paranoid about the cops , but the man in the CASE FARM EQUIPMENT hat had looked really scared . And pissed . They had n't gone even a quarter of a mile when a deep , burning stitch settled into his side and he asked Wolf if he could give him a piggyback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , " Jack said , and pantomimed . A big grin had overspread Wolf 's face . Here at last was something he understood ; here was something he could do . " You want a horseyback ! " he cried , delighted . " Yeah , I guess ... " " Oh , yeah ! Wolf ! Here and now ! Used to give em to my litterbrothers ! Jump up , Jack ! " Wolf bent down , holding his curved hands ready , stirrups for Jack 's thighs . " Now when I get too heavy , just put me d  --  " Before he could finish , Wolf had swept him up and was running lightly down the road with him into the dark  --  really running . The cold , rainy air flipped Jack 's hair back from his hot brow . " Wolf , you 'll wear yourself out ! " Jack shouted . " Not me ! Wolf ! Wolf ! Runnin here and now ! " For the first time since they had come over , Wolf sounded actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they were well west of Arcanum and travelling along a dark , unmarked stretch of two-lane blacktop . Jack saw a deserted barn standing slumped in a shaggy , untended field , and they slept there that night . Wolf wanted nothing to do with downtown areas where the traffic was a roaring flood and the stinks rose up to heaven in a noxious cloud , and Jack did n't want anything to do with them , either . Wolf stuck out too much . But he had forced one stop , at a roadside store just across the Indiana line , near Harrisville . While Wolf waited nervously out by the road , hunkering down , digging at the dirt , getting up , walking around in a stiff little circle , then hunkering again , Jack bought a newspaper and checked the weather page carefully . The next full moon wasp251on October 31st  --  Halloween , that was fitting enough . Jack turned back to the front page so he could see what day it was today . . . yesterday , that had been now . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass doors and stepped inside the lobby of the Town Line Sixplex . He looked around sharply at Wolf , but Wolf looked  --  for the moment , at least  --  pretty much okay . Wolf was , in fact , cautiously optimistic . . . at least for the moment . He did n't like being inside a building , but at least it was n't a car . There was a good smell in here  --  light and sort of tasty . Or would have been , except for a bitter , almost rancid undersmell . Wolf looked left and saw a glass box full of white stuff . That was the source of the good light smell . " Jack , " he whispered . " Huh ? " " I want some of that white stuff , please . But none of the pee . " " Pee ? What are you talking about ? " Wolf searched for a more formal word and found it . " Urine . " He pointed at a thing with a light going off and on inside it . BUTTERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urine , is n't it ? It 's got to be , the way it smells . " Jack smiled tiredly . " A popcorn without the fake butter , right , " he said . " Now pipe down , okay ? " " Sure , Jack , " Wolf said humbly . " Right here and now . " The ticket-girl had been chewing a big wad of grape-flavored bubble gum . Now she stopped . She looked at Jack , then at Jack 's big , hulking companion . The gum sat on her tongue inside her half-open mouth like a large purple tumor . She rolled her eyes at the guy behind the counter . " Two , please , " Jack said . He took out his roll of bills , dirty , tag-eared ones with an orphan five hiding in the middle . " Which show ? " Her eyes moved back and forth , back and forth , Jack to Wolf and Wolf to Jack . She looked like a woman watching a hot table-tennis match . " What 's just starting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She glanced down at the paper Scotch-taped beside her . " There 's The Flying Dragon in Cinema Four . It 's a kung-fu movie with ( shuck Norris . " Back and forth went her eyes , back and forth , back and forth . " Then , in Cinema Six , there 's a double feature . Two Ralph Bakshi cartoons . Wizards and The Lord of the Rings . " Jack felt relieved . Wolf was nothing but a big , overgrown kid , and kids loved cartoons . This could work out after all . Wolf would maybep252find at least one thing in the Country of Bad Smells that would amuse him , and Jack could sleep for three hours . " That one , " he said . " The cartoons . " " That 'll be four dollars , " she said . " Bargain Matinee prices end at two . " She pushed a button and two tickets poked out of a slot with a mechanical ratcheting noise . Wolf flinched backward with a small cry . The girl looked at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I 'm Wolf , " Wolf said . He smiled , showing a great many teeth . Jack would have sworn that Wolf showed more teeth now when he smiled than he had a day or two ago . The girl looked at all those teeth . She wet her lips . " He 's okay . He just  --  " Jack shrugged . " He does n't get off the farm much . You know . " He gave her the orphan five . She handled it as if she wished she had a pair of tongs to do it with . " Come on , Wolf . " As they turned away to the candy-stand , Jack stuffing the one into the pocket of his grimy jeans , the ticket-girl mouthed to the counterman : Look at his nose ! Jack looked at Wolf and saw Wolf 's nose flaring rhythmically . " Stop that , " he muttered . " Stop what , Jack ? " " Doing that thing with your nose . " " Oh . I 'll try , Jack , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son ? " the counterman asked . " Yes , please . A Junior Mints , a Reese 's Pieces , and an extra-large popcorn without the grease . " The counterman got the stuff and pushed it across to them . Wolf got the tub of popcorn in both hands and immediately began to snaffle it up in great jaw-cracking chomps . The counterman looked at this silently . " Does n't get off the farm much , " Jack repeated . Part of him was already wondering if these two had seen enough of sufficient oddness to get them thinking that a call to the police might be in order . He thought  --  not for the first time  --  that there was a real irony in all this . In New York or L.A. , probably no one would have given Wolf a second look . . . or if a second look , certainly not a third . Apparently the weirdness-toleration level was a lot lower out in the middle of the country . But , of course , Wolf would have flipped out of his gourd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. " I 'll bet he do n't , " the counterman said . " That 'll be two-eighty. "  |p253Jack  paid it with an inward wince , realizing he had just laid out a quarter of his cash for their afternoon at the movies . Wolf was grinning at the counterman through a mouthful of popcorn . Jack recognized it as Wolf 's A #I Friendly Smile , but he somehow doubted that the counterman was seeing it that way . There were all those teeth in that smile . . . hundreds of them , it seemed . And Wolf was flaring his nostrils again . Screw it , let them call the cops , if that 's what they want to do , he thought with a weariness that was more adult than child . It ca n't slow us down much more than we 're slowed down already . He ca n't ride in the new cars because he ca n't stand the smell of the catalytic convertors and he ca n't ride in old cars because they smell like exhaust and sweat and oil and beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's so goddam claustrophobic . Tell the truth , Jack-0 , even if it 's only to yourself . You 're going along telling yourself he 's going to get over it pretty soon , but it 's probably not going to happen . So what are we going to do ? Walk across Indiana , I guess . Correction , Wolf is going to walk across Indiana . Me , I 'm going to cross Indiana riding horseyhack . But first I 'm going to take Wolf into this damn movie theater and sleep either until both pictures are over or until the cops arrive . And that is the end of my tale , sir . " Well , enjoy the show , " the counterman said . " You bet , " Jack replied . He started away and then realized Wolf was n't with him . Wolf was staring at something over the counterman 's head with vacant , almost superstitious wonder . Jack looked up and saw a mobile advertising the re-issue of Steven Spielberg 's Close Encounters floating around on drafts of convection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf knew it was n't going to work as soon as they went through the door . The room was small , dim , and dank . The smells in here were terrible . A poet , smelling what Wolf was smelling at that moment , might have called it the stink of sour dreams . Wolf was no poet . He only knew that the smell of the popcorn-urine predominated , and that he felt suddenly like throwing up . Then the lights began to dim even further , turning the room into a cave . " Jack , " he moaned , clutching at Jack 's arm . " Jack , we oughtta get out of here , okay ? "  | " You 'll like it , Wolf , " Jack muttered , aware of Wolf 's distress but not of its depth . Wolf was , after all , always distressed to some degree . In this world , the word distress defined him . " Try it . " " Okay , " Wolf said , and Jack heard the agreement but not the thin waver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his control with both hands . They sat down with Wolf on the aisle , his knees accordioned up uncomfortably , the tub of popcorn ( which he no longer wanted ) clutched to his chest . In front of them a match flared briefly yellow . Jack smelled the dry tang of pot , so familiar in the movies that it could be dismissed as soon as identified . Wolf smelled a forest-fire . " Jack  --  ! " " Shhh , picture 's starting . " And I 'm dozing off . Jack would never know of Wolf 's heroism in the next few minutes ; Wolf did not really know of it himself . He only knew that he had to try and stick this nightmare out for Jack 's sake . It must be all right , he thought , look , Wolf , Jack 's going right to sleep , right to sleep right here and now . And you know Jack would n't take you to a Hurt-Place , so just stick it out . . . just wait . . . Wolff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf was a cyclic creature , and his cycle was approaching its monthly climax . His instincts had become exquisitely refined , almost undeniable . His rational mind told him that he would be all right in here , that Jack would n't have brought him otherwise . But that was like a man with an itchy nose telling himself not to sneeze in church because it was impolite . He sat there smelling forest-fire in a dark , stinking cave , twitching each time a shadow passed down the aisle , waiting numbly for something to fall on him from the shadows overhead . And then a magic window opened at the front of the cave and he sat there in the acrid stink of his own terror-sweat , eyes wide , face a mask of horror , as cars crashed and overturned , as buildings burned , as one man chased another . " Previews , " Jack mumbled . " Told you you 'd like it .... " There were Voices . One said nosmoking . One said don'tlitter . One said group ratesavailable . One said **44;12331;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled . He started to say something else , but it turned into a snore . A final voice said **28;12377;TOOLONG and that was when Wolf lost control . Bakshi 's The Lord of the Rings was in Dolby sound , and the projectionist had orders to really crank it in the afternoons , because that 's when the heads drifted in , and the heads really liked loud Dolby.  |p255There  was a screeching , discordant crash of brass . The magic window opened again and now Wolf could see the fire  --  shifting oranges and reds . He howled and leaped to his feet , pulling with him a Jack who was more asleep than awake . " Jack ! " he screamed . " Get out ! Got to get out ! Wolff See the fire ! Wolff Wolf ! " " Down in front ! " someone shouted . " Shut up , hoser ! " someone else yelled . The door at the back of Cinema 6 opened . " What 's going on in here ? " " Wolf , shut up ! " Jack hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Wolf howled . A woman got a good look at Wolf as the white light from the lobby fell on him . She screamed and began dragging her little boy out by one arm . Literally dragging him ; the kid had fallen to his knees and was skidding up the popcorn-littered carpet of the center aisle . One of his sneakers had come off . " **79;12440;TOOLONG ! " The pothead three rows down had turned around and was looking at them with bleary interest . He held a smouldering joint in one hand ; a spare was cocked behind his ear . " Far . . . out , " he pronounced . " Fucking werewolves of London strike again , right ? " " Okay , " Jack said . " Okay , we 'll get out . No problem . Just ... just do n't do that anymore , okay ? Okay ? " He started leading Wolf out . The weariness had fallen over him again . The light of the lobby hit his eyes sharply , needling them . The woman who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a corner with her arms around the kid . When she saw Jack lead the stillhowlingWolf through the double doors of Cinema 6 , she swept the kid up and made a break for it . The counterman , the ticket-girl , the projectionist , and a tall man in a sportcoat that looked as if it belonged on the back of a racetrack tout were clustered together in a tight little group . Jack supposed the guy in the checkered sportcoat and white shoes was the manager . The doors of the other cinemas in the hive had opened partway . Faces peered out of the darkness to see what all the hooraw was . To Jack , they all looked like badgers peering out of their holes . " Get out ! " the man in the checkered sportcoat said . " Get out , I 've tailed the police already , they 'll be here in five minutes . " Bullshit you did , Jack thought , feeling a ray of hope . You did n't have time . And if we blow right away , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going , " he said . " Look , I 'm sorry . It 's just that . . . my big brother 's an epileptic and he just had a seizure . We . . . we forgot his medicine . " At the word epileptic , the ticket-girl and the counterman recoiled . It was as if Jack had said leper . " Come on , Wolf . " He saw the manager 's eyes drop , saw his lip curl with distaste . Jack followed the glance and saw the wide dark stain on the front of Wolf 's Oshkosh biballs . He had wet himself . Wolf also saw . Much in Jack 's world was foreign to him , but he apparently knew well enough what that look of contempt meant . He burst into loud , braying , heartbroken sobs . Jack , I 'm sorry , Wolf is so SORRY ! " " Get him out of here , " the manager said contemptuously , and turned away . Jack put an arm around Wolf and got him started toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spoke quietly , and with an honest tenderness . He had never felt quite so keenly for Wolf as he did now . " Come on , it was my fault , not yours . Let 's go . " " Sorry . " Wolf wept brokenly . " I 'm no good , God pound me , just no good . " " You 're plenty good , " Jack said . " Come on . " He pushed open the door and they went out into the thin , lateOctoberwarmth . The woman with the child was easily twenty yards away , but when she saw Jack and Wolf , she retreated backward toward her car , holding her kid in front of her like a cornered gangster with a hostage . " Do n't let him come near me ! " she screamed . " Do n't let that monster come near my baby ! Do you hear ? Do n't let him come near me ! " Jack thought he should say something to calm her down , but he could n't think what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf started away , heading across the parking lot at an angle . Halfway back to the road , Jack staggered . The world went briefly gray . He was vaguely aware of Wolf sweeping him up in his arms and carrying him that way , like a baby . Vaguely aware that Wolf was crying . " Jack , I 'm so sorry , please do n't hate Wolf , I can be a good old Wolf , you wait , you 'll see .... " " I do n't hate you , " Jack said . " I know you 're . . . you 're a good old  --  " But before he could finish , he had fallen asleep . When he woke up it was evening and Muncie was behind them . Wolf had gotten off the main roads and on to a web of farm roads and dirt tracks . TotallyP257unconfused by the lack of signs and the multitude of choices , he had continued west with all the unerring instinct of a migrating bird . They slept that night in an empty house north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fever had gone down a little . It was midmorning  --  midmorning of October 28th  --  when Jack realized that the hair was back on Wolf 's palms.  |p258They  camped that night in the ruins of a burned-out house with a wide field on one side and a copse of woods on another . There was a farmhouse on the far side of the field , but Jack thought that he and Wolf would be safe enough if they were quiet and stayed in most of the time . After the sun went down , Wolf went off into the woods . He was moving slowly , his face close to the ground . Before Jack lost sight of him , he thought that Wolf looked like a nearsighted man hunting for his dropped spectacles . Jack became quite nervous ( visions of Wolf caught in a steel-jawed trap had begun to come to him , Wolf caught and grimly not howling as he gnawed at his own leg ... ) before Wolf returned , walking almost upright this time , and carrying plants in both hands , the roots dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Wolf ? " Jack asked . " Medicine , " Wolf said morosely . " But it 's not very good , Jack . Wolf ! Nothing 's much good in your world ! " " Medicine ? What do you mean ? " But Wolf would say no more . He produced two wooden matches from the bib pocket of his overalls and started a smokeless fire and asked Jack if he could find a can . Jack found a beercan in the ditch . Wolf smelled it and wrinkled his nose . " More bad smells . Need water , Jack . Clean water . I 'll go , if you 're too tired . " " Wolf , I want to know what you 're up to . " " I 'll go , " Wolf said . " There 's a farm right across that field . Wolf ! There 'll be water there . You rest . " Jack had a vision of some farmer 's wife looking out the kitchen window as she did the supper dishes and seeing Wolf skulking around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of roots and herbs in the other . " I 'll go , " he said . The farm was not five hundred feet away from where they had camped ; the warm yellow lights were clearly visible across the field . Jack went , P259filled the beercan at a shed faucet without incident , and started back . Halfway across the field he realized he could see his shadow , and looked up at the sky . The moon , now almost full , rode the eastern horizon . Troubled , Jack went back to Wolf and gave him the can of water . Wolf sniffed , winced again , but said nothing . He put the can over the fire and began to sift crumbled bits of the things he had picked in through the pop-top hole . Five minutes or so later , a terrible smell  --  a reek , not to put too fine a point on it  --  began to rise on the steam . Jack winced . He had no doubt at all that Wolf would want him to drink that stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slowly and horribly , probably . He closed his eyes and began snoring loudly and theatrically . If Wolf thought he was sleeping , he would n't wake him up . No one woke up sick people , did they ? And Jack was sick ; his fever had come back at dark , raging through him , punishing him with chills even while he oozed sweat from every pore . Looking through his lashes , he saw Wolf set the can aside to cool . Wolf sat back and looked skyward , his hairy hands locked around his knees , his face dreamy and somehow beautiful . He 's looking at the moon , Jack thought , and felt a thread of fear . We do n't go near the herd when we change . Good Jason , no ! We 'd eat them ! Wolf , tell me something : am I the herd now ? Jack shivered . Five minutes later Jack almost had gone to sleep by then  --  Wolf leaned over the can , sniffed , nodded , picked it up , and came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam with an extra shirt behind his neck to pad the angle . Jack closed his eyes tightly and resumed snoring . " Come on , Jack , " Wolf said jovially . " I know you 're awake . You ca n't fool Wolf . " Jack opened his eyes and looked at Wolf with bleary resentment . " How did you know ? " " People have a sleep-smell and a wake-smell , " Wolf said . " Even Strangers must know that , do n't they ? " " I guess we do n't , " Jack said . " Anyway , you have to drink this . It 's medicine . Drink it up , Jack , right here and now . " " I do n't want it , " Jack said . The smell coming from the can was swampy and rancid . " Jack , " Wolf said , " you 've got a sick-smell , too . " P260Jack looked at him , saying nothing . " Yes , " Wolf said . " And it keeps getting worse . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to get bad if you do n't take some medicine . " " Wolf , I 'll bet you 're great at sniffing out herbs and things back in the Territories , but this is the Country of Bad Smells , remember ? You 've probably got ragweed in there , and poison oak , and bitter vetch , and  --  " " They 're good things , " Wolf said . " Just not very strong , God pound them . " Wolf looked wistful . " Not everything smells bad here , Jack . There are good smells , too . But the good smells are like the medicine plants . Weak . I think they were stronger , once . " Wolf was looking dreamily up at the moon again , and Jack felt a recurrence of his earlier unease . " I 'll bet this was a good place once , " Wolf said . " Clean and full of power . . . " Wolf ? " Jack asked in a low voice . " Wolf , the hair 's come back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment  --  it might have been his feverish imagination , and even if not , it was only for a moment  --  Wolf looked at Jack with a flat , greedy hunger . Then he seemed to shake himself , as if out of a bad dream . " Yes , " he said . " But I do n't want to talk about that , and I do n't want you to talk about that . It does n't matter , not yet . Wolf ! Just drink your medicine , Jack , that 's all you have to do . " Wolf was obviously not going to take no for an answer ; if Jack did n't drink the medicine , then Wolf might feel duty-bound to simply pull open his jaws and pour it down his throat . " Remember , if this kills me , you 'll be alone , " Jack said grimly , taking the can . It was still warm . A look of terrible distress spread over Wolf 's face . He pushed the round glasses up on his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Wolf never wants to hurt Jack . " The expression was so large and so full of misery that it would have been ludicrous had it not been so obviously genuine . Jack gave in and drank the contents of the can . There was no way he could stand against that expression of hurt dismay . The taste was as awful as he had imagined it would be . . . and for a moment did n't the world waver ? Did n't it waver as if he were about to flip back into the Territories ? " Wolf ! " he yelled . " Wolf , grab my hand ! " Wolf did , looking both concerned and excited . " Jack ? Jacky ? What is it ? " The taste of the medicine began to leave his mouth . At the sameP261time , a warm glow  --  the sort of glow he got from a small sip of brandy on the few occasions his mother had allowed him to have one  --  began to spread in his stomach . And the world grew solid around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . but Jack did n't think so . We almost went . For a moment there it was very close . Maybe I can do it without the magic juice . . . maybe I can ! " Jack ? What is it ? " " I feel better , " he said , and managed a smile . " I feel better , that 's all . " He discovered that he did , too . " You smell better , too , " Wolf said cheerfully . " Wolf ! Wolf ! " I le continued to improve the next day , but he was weak . Wolf carried him " horseyback " and they made slow progress west . Around dusk they started looking for a place to lie up for the night . Jack spotted a woodshed in a dirty little gully . It was surrounded by trash and bald tires . Wolf agreed without saying much . He had been quiet and morose all day long . Jack fell asleep almost at once and woke up around eleven needing to urinate . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jack thought he had probably gone in search of more herbs in order to administer the equivalent of a booster shot . Jack wrinkled his nose , but It Wolf wanted him to drink more of the stuff , he would . It surely had made him feel one hell of a lot better . I le went around to the side of the shed , a straight slim boy wearing . Jockey shorts , unlaced sneakers , and an open shirt . He peed for what seemed a very long time indeed , looking up at the sky as he did so . It was one of those misleading nights which sometimes come to the midwestin October and early November , not so long before winter comes down with a cruel , iron snap . It was almost tropically warm , and the mild breeze was like a caress . Overhead floated the moon , white and round and lovely . It cast a ( leaf- and yet eerily misleading glow over everything , seeming to simultaneouslyenhance and obscure . Jack stared at it , aware that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go near the herd when we change . Good Jason , no ! Am I the herd now , Wolf ! There was a face on the moon . Jack saw with no surprise that it was Wolf 's face . . . except it was not wide and open and a little surprised , a lace of goodness and simplicity . This face was narrow , ah yes , andP262dark ; it was dark with hair , but the hair did n't matter . It was dark with intent . We do n't go near them , we 'd eat them , eat them , we 'd eat them , Jack , when we change we'dThe face in the moon , a chiaroscuro carved in bone , was the face of a snarling beast , its head cocked in that final moment before the lunge , the mouth open and filled with teeth . We 'd eat we 'd kill we 'd kill , kill , KILL KILLA finger touched Jack 's shoulder and ran slowly down to his waist . Jack had only been standing there with his penis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger , looking atthe moon . Now a fresh , hard jet of urine spurted out of him . " I scared you , " Wolf said from behind him . " I 'm sorry , Jack . Godpound me . " But for a moment Jack did n't think Wolf was sorry . For a moment it sounded as if Wolf were grinning . And Jack was suddenly sure he was going to be eaten up . House of bricks ? he thought incoherently . I do n't even have a house of straw that I can run to . Now the fear came , dry terror in his veins hotter than any fever . Who 's afraid of the big bad Wolf the big bad Wolf the big bad  --  " Jack ? " I am , I am , oh God I am afraid of the big bad WolfHe turned around slowly . Wolf 's face , which had been lightly scruffed with stubble when the two of them crossed to the shed and lay down , was now heavily bearded from a point so high on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples . His eyes glared a bright red-orange . " Wolf , are you all right ? " Jack asked in a husky , breathy whisper . It was as loud as he could talk . " Yes , " Wolf said . " I 've been running with the moon . It 's beautiful . I ran . . . and ran . . . and ran . But I 'm all right , Jack . " Wolf smiled to show how all right he was , and revealed a mouthful of giant , rending teeth . Jack recoiled in numb horror . It was like looking into the mouth of that Alien thing in the movies . Wolf saw his expression , and dismay crossed his roughened , thickeningfeatures . But under the dismay  --  and not far under , either  --  was something else . Something that capered and grinned and showed its teeth . Something that would chase prey until blood flew from the prey 's nose in its terror , until it moaned and begged . Something that would laugh as it tore the screaming prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . Especially if he were the prey . P263Jack , I 'm sorry , " he said . " The time ... it 's coming . We 'll have to do something . We 'll . . . tomorrow . We 'll have to . . . have to . . . " He looked up and that hypnotized expression spread over his face as he looked into the sky . He raised his head and howled . And Jack thought he heard  --  very faintly  --  the Wolf in the moon howl back . Horror stole through him , quietly and completely . Jack slept no more that night. .3 .. The next day Wolf was better . A little better , anyway , but he was almost sick with tension . As he was trying to tell Jack what to do  --  as well as he could , anyway  --  a jet plane passed high overhead . Wolf jumped to his feet , rushed out , and howled at it , shaking his fists at the sky . His hairy feet were bare again . They had swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to tell Jack what to do , but he had little to go on except old tales and rumors . He knew what the change was in his own world , but he sensed it might be much worse  --  more powerful and more dangerous  --  inthe land of the Strangers . And he felt that now . He felt that power sweeping through him , and tonight when the moon rose he felt sure it would sweep him away . Over and over again he reiterated that he did n't want to hurt Jack , that he would rather kill himself than hurt Jack. 1 ) aleville was the closest small town . Jack got there shortly after the courthouse clock struck noon , and went into the True Value hardware store . One hand was stuffed into his pants pocket , touching his depleted roll of bills . " Help you , son ? " " Yes sir , " Jack said . " I want to buy a padlock . " " Well , step over here and let 's us have a look . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you name it . What kind of padlock you want ? " " A big one , " Jack said , looking at the clerk with his shadowed , somehowdisquieting eyes . His face was gaunt but still persuasive in its odd beauty . " A big one , " the clerk mused . " And what would you be wanting it for , might I ask ? "   " My dog , " Jack said steadily . A Story . Always they wanted a Story . He had gotten this one ready on the way in from the shed where they had spent the last two nights . " I need it for my dog . I have to lock him up . He bites . " The padlock he picked out cost ten dollars , leaving Jack with about ten dollars to his name . It hurt him to spend that much , and he almost went for a cheaper item . . . and then he had a memory of how Wolf had looked the night before , howling at the moon with orange fire spilling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck out his thumb at every passing car as he hurried back to the shed , but of course none of them stopped . Perhaps he looked too wild-eyed , too frantic . He certainly felt wild-eyed and frantic . The newspaperthe hardware store clerk had let him look at promised sunset at six o'clock p.m. on the dot . Moonrise was not listed , but Jack guessed seven , at the latest . It was already one p.m. , and he had no idea where he was going to put Wolf for the night . You have to lock me up , Jack , Wolf had said . Have to lock me up good . Because if I get out , I 'll hurt anything I can run down and catch hold of . Even you , Jack . Even you . So you have to lock me up and keep me locked up , no matter what I do or what I say . Three days , Jack , until the moon starts to get thin again . Three days . . . even four , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be someplace away from people , so no one would hear Wolf if  --  when , he amended reluctantly  --  he began to howl . And it had to be someplace a lot stronger than the shed they had been staying in . If Jack used his fine new ten-dollar padlock on the door of that place , Wolf would bust right out through the back . Where ? He did n't know , but he knew he had only six hours to find a place . . . maybe less . Jack began to hurry along even faster . They had passed several empty houses to come this far , had even spent the night in one , and Jack watched all the way back from Daleville for the signs of lack of occupancy : for blank uncovered windows and FOR SALE signs , for grass grown as high as the second porch step and the sense of lifelessness common to empty houses . It was not that heP265hoped he could lock Wolf into some farmer 's bedroom for the three days of his Change . Wolf would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one farmhouse had a root cellar ; that would have worked . A stout oaken door set into a grassy mound like a door in a fairy tale , and behind it a room without walls or ceiling  --  an underground room , a cave no creature could dig its way out of in less than a month . The cellar would have held Wolf , and the earthen floor and walls would have kept him from injuring himself . But the empty farmhouse , and the root cellar , must have been at least thirty or forty miles behind them . They would never make it back there in the time remaining before moonrise . And would Wolf still be willing to run forty miles , especially for the purpose of putting himself in a foodless solitary confinement , so close to the time of his Change ? Suppose , in fact , that too much time had passed . Suppose that Wolf had come too close to the edge and would refuse any sort of imprisonment ? What if that capering , greedy underside of his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look around this odd new world , wondering where the food was hiding ? The big padlock threatening to rip the seams out of Jack 's pocket would be useless . He could turn around , Jack realized . He could walk back to Daleville and keep on going . In a day or two he 'd be nearly to Lapel or Cicero , and maybe he could work an afternoon at a feed store or get in some hours as a farmhand , make a few dollars or scrounge a meal or two , and then push all the way to the Illinois border in the next few days . Illinois would be easy , Jack thought  --  he did n't know how he was going to do this , exactly , but he was pretty sure he could get to Springfieldand the Thayer School only a day or two after he made it into Illinois . And , Jack puzzled as he hesitated a quarter-mile down the road from the shed , how could he explain Wolf to Richard Sloat ? His old buddy Richard , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thoroughly rational and , though very intelligent , hard-headed . If you could n't see it , it probably did n't exist . Richard had never been interested in fairy tales as a child ; he had remained unexcited by Disney films about fairy godmothers who turned pumpkins into coaches , about wicked queens who owned speaking mirrors . Such conceits were too absurd to snare Richard 's six-year-old ( or eight-year-old , or ten-year-. old ) fancy  --  unlike , say , a photograph of an electron microscope . Richard'senthusiasm had embraced Rubik 's Cube , which he could solve in less than ninety seconds , but Jack did not think it would go so far as to accept a six-foot-five , sixteen-year-old werewolf . For a moment Jack twisted helplessly on the road  --  for a moment heP266almost thought that he would be able to leave Wolf behind and get on with his journey toward Richard and then the Talisman . What if I 'm the herd ? he asked himself silently . And what he thought of was Wolf scrambling down the bank after his poor terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shed was empty . As soon as Jack saw the door leaning open he knew that Wolf had taken himself off somewhere , but he scrambled down the side of the gully and picked his way through the trash almost in disbelief . Wolf could not have gone farther than a dozen feet by himself , yet he had done so . " I 'm back , " Jack called . " Hey , Wolf ? I got the lock . " He knew he was talking to himself , and a glance into the shed confirmed this . His pack lay on a little wooden bench ; a stack of pulpy magazines dated 1973 stood beside it . In one corner of the windowless wooden shed odd lengths of deadwood had been carelessly heaped , as if someone had once half-heartedly made a stab at squirrelling away firewood . Otherwise the shed was bare . Jack turned around from the gaping door and looked helplessly up the banks of the gully . Old tires scattered here and there among the weeds , a bundle of faded and rotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-and-white Connecticut license plate , beer-bottles with labels so faded they were white ... no Wolf . Jack raised his hands to cup his mouth . " Hey , Wolf ! I 'm back ! " He expected no reply , and got none . Wolf was gone . " Shit , " Jack said , and put his hands on his hips . Conflicting emotions , exasperation and relief and anxiety , surged through him . Wolf had left in order to save Jack 's life  --  that had to be the meaning of his disappearance . As soon as Jack had set off for Daleville , his partner had skipped out . He had run away on those tireless legs and by now was miles away , waiting for the moon to come up . By now , Wolf could be anywhere . This realization was part of Jack 's anxiety . Wolf could have taken himself into the woods visible at the end of the long field bordered by the gully , and in the woods gorged himself on rabbits and fieldmice and whatever else might live there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wind in the Willows . Which would have been dandy . But Wolf just might sniff out the livestock , wherever it was , and put himself in real danger . He might also , Jack realized , sniff out the farmer and his family . Or , even worse , Wolf might have worked his way close to one of the towns north of them . Jack could n't be sure , but he thought thatP267a transformed Wolf would probably be capable of slaughtering at least half a dozen people before somebody finally killed him . " Damn , damn , damn , " Jack said , and began to climb up the far side of the gully . He had no real hopes of seeing Wolf  --  he would probably never see Wolf again , he realized . In some smalltown paper , a few days down the road , he 'd find a horrified description of the carnage caused by an enormous wolf which had apparently wandered into Main Street looking for food . And there would be more names . More names like Thielke , Heidel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping even now to see Wolf 's giant form skulking away to the east  --  he would n't want to meet Jack returning from Daleville . The long road was as deserted as the shed . Of course . The sun , as good a clock as the one he wore on his wrist , had slipped well below its meridian . Jack turned despairingly toward the long field and the edge of the woods behind it . Nothing moved but the tips of the stubble , which bent before a chill wandering breeze . HUNT CONTINUES FOR KILLER WOLF , a headline would read , a few days down the road . Then a large brown boulder at the edge of the woods did move , and lack realized that the boulder was Wolf . He had hunkered down on his heels and was staring at Jack . " Oh , you inconvenient son of a bitch , " Jack said , and in the midst of his relief knew that a part of him had been secretly delighted by Wolf 's departure . He stepped toward him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became more electric and aware . Jack 's next step required more courage than the first . Twenty yards farther , he saw that Wolf had continued to change . His hair had become even thicker , more luxuriant , as if it had been washed and blow-dried ; and now Wolf 's beard really did seem to begin just beneath his eyes . His entire body , hunkered down as it was , seemed to have become wider and more powerful . His eyes , filled with liquid fire , blazed Halloween orange . Jack made himself go nearer . He nearly stopped when he thought he saw that Wolf now had paws instead of hands , but a moment later realized that his hands and fingers were completely covered by a thatch of coarse dark hair . Wolf continued to gaze at him with his blazing eyes . Jack again halved the distance between them , then paused . For the first time since he had come upon Wolf tending his flock beside a Territories stream , he could not read his expression . Maybe Wolf had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply concealed too much of his face . What he was sure of was that some strong emotion had gripped Wolf . A dozen feet away he stopped for good and forced himself to look into the werewolf 's eyes . " Soon now , Jacky , " Wolf said , and his mouth dropped open in a fearsome parody of a smile . " I thought you ran away , " Jack said . " Sat here to see you coming . Wolf ! " Jack did not know what to make of this declaration . Obscurely , it reminded him of Little Red Riding Hood . Wolf 's teeth did look particularlycrowded , sharp , and strong . " I got the lock , " he said . He pulled it out of his pocket and held it up . " You have any ideas while I was gone , Wolf ? " Wolf 's whole face  --  eyes , teeth , everything  --  blazed out at Jack . " You 're the herd now , Jacky , " Wolf said . And lifted his head and released a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said , " Can that stuff , willya ? " or " We 'll have every dog in the county around here if you keep that up , " but both of these statements died in his throat . He was too scared to utter a word . Wolf gave him his A # z smile again , his mouth looking like a television commercial for Ginsu knives , and rose effortlessly to his feet . The John Lennon glasses seemed to be receding back into the bristly top of his beard and the thick hair falling over his temples . He looked at least seven feet tall to Jack , and as burly as the beer barrels in the back room of the Oatley Tap . " You have good smells in this world , Jacky , " Wolf said . And Jack finally recognized his mood . Wolf was exultant . He was like a man who against steep odds had just won a particularly difficult contest . At the bottom of this triumphant emotion percolated that joyful and feral quality Jack had seen once before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicate step backward , wondering if he was upwind of Wolf . " You never said anything good about it before , " he said , not quite coherently . " Before is before and now is now , " Wolf said . " Good things . Many good things  --  all around . Wolf will find them , you bet . " That made it worse , for now Jack could see  --  could nearly feel  --  a flat , confident greed , a wholly amoral hunger shining in the reddish eyes . I 'll eat anything I catch and kill , it said . Catch and kill .   " I hope none of those good things are people , Wolf , " Jack said quietly . Wolf lifted his chin and uttered a bubbling series of noises half-howl , half-laughter . " Wolfs need to eat , " he said , and his voice , too , was joyous . " Oh , Jacky , how Wolfs do need to eat . EAT ! Wolf ! " " I 'm going to have to put you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf ? I got the lock ' ? We 'll just have to hope it 'll hold you . Let 's start over there now , Wolf . You 're scaring the shit out of me . " This time the bubbling laughter ballooned out of Wolf 's chest . " Scared ! Wolf knows ! Wolf knows , Jacky ! You have the fear-smell . " " I 'm not surprised , " Jack said . " Let 's get over to that shed now , okay ? " " Oh , I 'm not going in the shed , " Wolf said , and a long pointed tongue curled out from between his jaws . " No , not me , Jacky . Not Wolf . Wolf ca n't go in the shed . " The jaws widened , and the crowded teeth shone . " Wolf remembered , Jacky . Wolf ! Right here and now ! Wolf remem-bered ! " Jack stepped backward . " More fear-smell . Even on your shoes . Shoes , Jacky ! Wolf ! " Shoes that smelled of fear were evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed , that 's what you should remember . " " Wrong ! Wolf ! You go in the shed , Jacky ! Jacky goes in shed ! I remembered ! Wolf ! " The werewolf 's eyes slid from blazing reddish-orange to a mellow , satisfied shade of purple .

" The jaws split and widened again , and the long dark tongue11 tied up at the tip in a perfect image of delight . " Not ! Not ! Not Injure l lis Herd ! Wolf ! Right here and now ! " " You want me to stay locked up in the shed for three days ? " Jack said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply , and the boy saw something dark , quick , and sinister slide toward him from Wolf 's changing eyes . " When the moon takes me with her , I have to eat . Good smells here , ky . Plenty of food for Wolf . When the moon lets me go , Jacky comes out of the shed . " " What happens if I do n't want to be locked up for three days ? " " ' Then Wolf will kill Jacky . And then Wolf will be damned . " ' This is all in The Book of Good Farming , is it ? " Wulf nodded his head . " I remembered . I remembered in time , Jacky . When I was waiting , for you . " P270Jack was still trying to adjust himself to Wolf 's idea . He would have to go three days without food . Wolf would be free to wander . He would be in prison , and Wolf would have the world . Yet it was probably the only way he would survive Wolf 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , he 'd choose an empty stomach . And then it suddenly seemed to Jack that this reversal was really no reversal at all  --  he would still be free , locked in the shed , and Wolf out in the world would still be imprisoned . His cage would just be larger than Jack 's . " Then God bless The Book of Good Farming , because I would never have thought of it myself . " Wolf gleamed at him again , and then looked up at the sky with a blank , yearning expression . " Not long now , Jacky . You 're the herd . I have to put you inside . " " Okay , " Jack said . " I guess you do have to . " And this too struck Wolf as uproariously funny . As he laughed his howling laugh , he threw an arm around Jack 's waist and picked him up and carried him all the way across the field . " Wolf will take care of you , Jacky , " he said when he had nearly howled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground at the top of the gully . " Wolf , " Jack said . Wolf widened his jaws and began rubbing his crotch . " You ca n't kill any people , Wolf , " Jack said . " Remember that  --  if you remembered that story , then you can remember not to kill any people . Because if you do , they 'll hunt you down for sure . If you kill any people , if you kill even one person , then a lot of people will come to kill you . And they 'd get you , Wolf . I promise you . They 'd nail your hide to a board . " " No people , Jacky . Animals smell better than people . No people . Wolf ! " They walked down the slope into the gully . Jack removed the lock from his pocket and several times clipped it through the metal ring that would hold it , showing Wolf how to use the key . " Then you slide the key under the door , okay ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you . " Jack glanced down at the bottom of the door  --  there was a two-inch gap between it and the ground . " Sure , Jacky . You 'll push it back to me . " " Well , what do we do now ? " Jack asked . " Should I go in the shed right now ? " " Sit there , " Wolf said , pointing to a spot on the floor of the shed a foot from the door . Jack looked at him curiously , then stepped inside the shed and sat down . Wolf hunkered back down just outside the shed 's open door , P271and without even looking at Jack , held out his hand toward the boy . Jack took Wolf 's hand . It was like holding a hairy creature about the size of a rabbit . Wolf squeezed so hard that Jack nearly cried out  --  but even if he had , he did n't think that Wolf would have heard him . Wolf was staring upward again , his face dreamy and peaceful and rapt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand into a more comfortable position inside Wolf 's grasp . " Are we going to stay like this a long time ? " he asked . Wolf took nearly a minute to answer . " Until , " he said , and squeezed Jack 's hand again. 9 . They sat like that , on either side of the doorframe , for hours , wordlessly , and finally the light began to fade . Wolf had been almost imperceptibly t rembling for the previous twenty minutes , and when the air grew darker the tremor in his hand intensified . It was , Jack thought , the way a thoroughbred horse might tremble in its stall at the beginning of a race , waiting for the sound of a gun and the gate to be thrown open . " She 's beginning to take me with her , " Wolf said softly . " Soon we 'll be running , Jack . I wish you could , too . " He turned his head to look at Jack , and the boy saw that while Wolf meant what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that was silently saying : I could run after you as well as beside you , little friend . " We have to close the door now , I guess , " Jack said . He tried to pull his hand from Wolf 's grasp , but could not free himself until Wolf almost disdainfully released him . " Lock Jacky in , lock Wolf out . " Wolf 's eyes flared for a moment , becoming red molten Elroy-eyes . " Remember , you 're keeping the herd safe , " Jack said . He stepped bit ( kward into the middle of the shed . The herd goes in the barn , and the lock goes on the door . He Would Not Injure His Herd . " Wolf 's eyes ceased to drip fire , shaded toward orange . " Put the lock on the door . " " God pound it , that 's what I 'm doing now , " Wolf said . " I 'm puttingthe God-pounding lock on the God-pounding door , see ? " He banged the door shut , immediately sealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's the God-pounding lock . " Jack heard the lock click against the metal loop , then heard its ratchets catch as Wolf slid it home . " Now the key , " Jack said . " God-pounding key , right here and now , " Wolf said , and a key rattled into a slot , rattled out . A second later the key bounced off the dustyP272ground beneath the door high enough to skitter onto the shed 's floorboards . " Thanks , " Jack breathed . He bent down and brushed his fingers along the boards until he touched the key . For a moment he clamped it so hard into his palm that he almost drove it through his skin  --  the bruise , shaped like the state of Florida , would endure nearly five days , when in the excitement of being arrested he would fail to notice that it had left him . Then Jack carefully slid the key into his pocket . Outside , Wolf was panting in hot regular agitated-sounding spurts . " Are you angry with me , Wolf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , hard . " Not ! Not angry ! Wolf ! " " All right , " Jack said . " No people , Wolf . Remember that . Or they'llhunt you down and kill you . " " No **26;12521;TOOLONG ! " The word turned into a long , liquid howl . Wolf 's body bumped against the door , and his long black-furred feet slid into the opening beneath it . Jack knew that Wolf had flattened himself out against the shed door . " Not angry , Jack , " Wolf whispered , as if his howl had embarrassed him . " Wolf is n't angry . Wolf is wanting , Jacky . It 's so soon now , so God-pounding soon . " " I know , " Jack said , now suddenly feeling as if he had to cry  --  he wished he could have hugged Wolf . More painfully , he wished that they had stayed the extra days at the farmhouse , and that he were now standing outside a root cellar where Wolf was safely jailed . The odd , disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wolf 's feet slid back under the door , and Jack thought he had a glimpse of them becoming more concentrated , slimmer , narrower . Wolf grunted , panted , grunted again . He had moved well back from the door . He uttered a noise very like " Aaah . " " Wolf ? " Jack said . An earsplitting howl lifted up from above Jack : Wolf had moved to the top of the gully . " Be careful , " Jack said , knowing that Wolf would not hear him , and fearing that he would not understand him even if he were close enough to hear . A series of howls followed soon after  --  the sound of a creature set free , or the despairing sound of one who wakes to find himself still confined , Jack could not tell which . Mournful and feral and oddly beautiful , the cries of poor Wolf flew up into the moonlit air like scarves flung into the night . Jack did not know he was trembling until he wrapped his arms around himself and felt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . The howls diminished , retreating . Wolf was running with the moon . P273For three days and three nights , Wolf was engaged in a nearly ceaseless search for food . He slept from each dawn until just past noon , in a hollow he had discovered beneath the fallen trunk of an oak . Certainly Wolf did not feel himself imprisoned , despite Jack 's forebodings . The woods on the other side of the field were extensive , and full of a wolf 's natural diet . Mice , rabbits , cats , dogs , squirrels  --  all these he found easily . He could have contained himself in the woods and eaten more than enough to carry him through to his next Change . But Wolf was riding with the moon , and he could no more confine himself to the woods than he could have halted his transformation in the first place . He roamed , led by the moon , through barnyards and pastures , past isolated suburban houses and down unfinished roads where bulldozers and giant asymmetrical rollers sat like sleeping dinosaurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sense of smell , and it is not exaggerating to suggest that Wolf 's nose , always acute , had now attained a condition of genius . He could not only smell a coop full of chickens five miles away and distinguish their odors from those of the cows and pigs and horses on the same farm  --  that was elementary  --  he could smell when the chickens moved . He could smell that one of the sleeping pigs had an injured foot , and one of the cows in the barn an ulcerated udder . And this world  --  for was it not this world 's moon which led him ?  --  no longer stank of chemicals and death . An older , more primitive order of being met him on his travels . He inhaled whatever remained of the earth 's original sweetness and power , whatever was left of qualities we might once have shared with the Territories . Even when he approached some human dwelling , even while he snapped the backbone of the family mutt and tore the dog into gristly rags he swallowed whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the ground , of bright snow on a mountain somewhere a long way west . This seemed a perfect place for a transmogrified Wolf , and if he had killed any human being he would have been damned . He killed no people . He saw none , and perhaps that is why . During the three days of his Change , Wolf did kill and devour representatives of most other forms of life to be found in eastern Indiana , including one skunk and an entire Lundy of bobcats living in limestone caves on a hillside two valleys away . On his first night in the woods he caught a low-flying bat in his jaws , hit off its head , and swallowed the rest while it was still jerking . Whole squadrons of domestic cats went down his throat , platoons of dogs . Withp274a wild , concentrated glee he one night slaughtered every pig in a pen the size of a city block . But twice Wolf found that he was mysteriously forbidden from killing his prey , and this too made him feel at home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of place , not of any abstract moral concern  --  and on the surface , the places were merely ordinary . One was a clearing in the woods into which he had chased a rabbit , the other the scruffy back yard of a farmhouse where a whimpering dog lay chained to a stake . The instant he set a paw down in these places , his hackles rose and an electric tingling traversed the entire distance of his spine . These were sacred places , and in a sacred place a Wolf could not kill . That was all . Like all hallowed sites , they had been set apart a long time ago , so long ago that the word ancient could have been used to describe them  --  ancient is probably as close as we can come to representing the vast well of time Wolf sensed about him in the farmer 's back yard and the little clearing , a dense envelope of years packed together in a small , highly charged location . Wolf simply backed off the sacred ground and took himself elsewhere . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so was comfortable with all such things . And he did not forget his obligations to Jack Sawyer . In the locked shed , Jack found himself thrown upon the properties of his own mind and character more starkly than at any other time in his life . The only furniture in the shed was the little wooden bench , the only distraction the nearly decade-old magazines . And these he could not actually read . Since there were no windows , except in very early morning when light came streaming under the door he had trouble just working out the pictures on the pages . The words were streams of gray worms , indecipherable . He could not imagine how he would get through the next three days . Jack went toward the bench , struck it painfully with his knee , and sat down to think . One of the first things he realized was that shed-time was different from time on the outside . Beyond the shed , seconds marched quickly past , melted into minutes which melted into hours . Whole days ticked along like metronomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move  --  they stretched into grotesque monsterseconds , Plasticman-seconds . Outside , an hour might go by while four or five seconds swelled and bloated inside the shed . The second thing Jack realized was that thinking about the slowness of time made it worse . Once you started concentrating on the passingp275of seconds , they more or less refused to move at all . So he tried to pace off the dimensions of his cell , just to take his mind off the eternity of seconds it took to make up three days . Putting one foot in front of another and counting his steps , he worked out that the shed was approximatelyseven feet by nine feet . At least there would be enough room for him to stretch out at night . If he walked all the way around the inside of the shed , he 'd walk about thirty-two feet . If he walked around the inside of the shed a hundred and sixty-five times , he 'd cover a mile . He might not be able to eat , but he sure could walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , promising himself that he would look at it only when he absolutely had to . He was about one-fourth of the way through his first mile when he remembered that there was no water in the shed . No food and no water . He supposed that it took longer than three or four days to die of thirst . As long as Wolf came back for him , he 'd be all right  --  well , maybe not all right , but at least alive . And if Wolf did n't come back ? He would have to break the door down . In that case , he thought , he 'd better try it now , while he still had some strength . Jack went to the door and pushed it with both hands . He pushed it harder , and the hinges squeaked . Experimentally , Jack threw his shoulderat the edge of the door , opposite the hinges . He hurt his shoulder , but he did n't think he had done anything to the door . He banged his shoulder against the door more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millimeter . Wolf could have torn the door off with one hand , but Jack did not think that he could move it if he turned his shoulders into hamburger by running into it . He would just have to wait for Wolf . By the middle of the night , Jack had walked seven or eight miles  --  he 'd lost count of the number of times he had reached one hundred and sixty-five , but it was something like seven or eight . He was parched , and his stomach was rumbling . The shed stank of urine , for Jack had been forced to pee against the far wall , where a crack in the boards meant that at least some of it went outside . His body was tired , but he did not think he could sleep . According to clock-time , Jack had been in the shed barely five hours ; in shed-time it was more like twenty-four . lie was afraid to lie down . His mind would not let him go  --  that was how it felt . He had tried making lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , of every teacher he 'd had , of every player on the Los Angeles Dodgers . . . but disturbing ,  |p276disorderly  images kept breaking in . He kept seeing Morgan Sloat tearing a hole in the air . Wolf 's face floated underwater , and his hands drifted down like heavy weeds . Jerry Bledsoe twitched and rocked before the electrical panel , his glasses smeared over his nose . A man 's eyes turned yellow , and his hand became a claw-hoof . Uncle Tommy 's false teeth coruscated in the Sunset Strip gutter . Morgan Sloat came toward him , his bald scalp suddenly rippling with black hair  --  but then Uncle Morgan was coming toward his mother , not himself . " Songs by Fats Waller , " he said , sending himself around another circuit in the dark . " Your Feets Too Big . " Ai n't Misbehavin . ' Jitterbug Waltz . ' Keepin Out of Mischief Now . ' " The Elroy-thing reached out toward his mother , whispering lewdly , and clamped a hand down over her hip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Costa Rica ... " Even when he was so tired he finally had to lie down and curl into a ball on the floor , using his knapsack as a pillow , Elroy and Morgan Sloat rampaged through his mind . Osmond flicked his bullwhip across Lily Cavanaugh 's back , and his eyes danced . Wolf reared up , massive , absolutelyinhuman , and caught a rifle bullet directly in the heart . The first light woke him , and he smelled blood . His whole body begged for water , then for food . Jack groaned . Three more nights of this would be impossible to survive . The low angle of the sunlight allowed him dimly to see the walls and roof of the shed . It all looked larger than he had felt it to be last night . He had to pee again , though he could scarcely believe that his body could afford to give up any moisture . Finally he realized that the shed seemed larger because he was lying on the floor . Then he smelled blood again , and looked sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit had been thrust through the gap . They lay sprawled on the rough boards , leaking blood , glistening . Smudges of dirt and a long ragged scrape showed that they had been forced into the shed . Wolf was trying to feed him . " Oh , Jeez , " Jack groaned . The rabbit 's stripped legs were disconcertinglyhuman . Jack 's stomach folded into itself . But instead of vomiting , he laughed , startled by an absurd comparison . Wolf was like the family pet who each morning presents his owners with a dead bird , an eviscerated mouse . With two fingers Jack delicately picked up the horrible offering and deposited it under the bench . He still felt like laughing , but his eyes were wet . Wolf had survived the first night of his transformation , and so had Jack.  |p277The  next morning brought an absolutely anonymous , almost ovoid knuckle of meat around a startlingly white bone splintered at both ends . On the morning of the fourth day Jack heard someone sliding down into the gully . A startled bird squawked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed . Heavy footsteps advanced toward the door . Jack raised himself onto his elbows and blinked into the darkness . A large body thudded against the door and stayed there . A pair of split and stained penny loafers was visible through the gap . " Wolf ? " Jack asked softly . " That 's you , is n't it ? " " Give me the key , Jack . " Jack slipped his hand into his pocket , brought out the key , and pushed it directly between the penny loafers . A large brown hand dropped into view and picked up the key . " Bring any water ? " Jack asked . Despite what he had been able to extract from Wolf 's gruesome presents , he had come close to serious dehydration  --  his lips were puffy and cracked , and his tongue felt swollen , baked . The key slid into the lock , and Jack heard it click open . Then the lock came away from the door . " A little , " Wolf said . " Close your eyes , Jacky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his eyes as the door opened , but the light which boomed and thundered into the shed still managed to trickle through his fingers and stab his eyes . He hissed with the pain . " Better soon , " Wolf said , very close to him . Wolf 's arms circled and lifted him . " Eyes closed , " Wolf warned , and stepped backward out of the shed . Even as Jack said , " Water , " and felt the rusty lip of an old cup meet his own lips , he knew why Wolf had not lingered in the shed . The air outside seemed unbelievably fresh and sweet  --  it might have been importeddirectly from the Territories . He sucked in a double tablespoon of- water that tasted like the best meal on earth and wound down through him like a sparkling little river , reviving everything it touched . He felt as though he were being irrigated . Wolf removed the cup from his lips long before Jack considered he was through with it . " If I give you more you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open your eyes , Jack  --  but only a little bit . " Jack followed directions . A million particles of light stormed into his eyes . He cried out . Wolf sat down , cradling Jack in his arms . " Sip , " he said , and put the cup once more to Jack 's lips . " Eyes open , little more . "  |p278Now  the sunlight hurt much less . Jack peered out through the screen of his eyelashes at a flaring dazzle while another miraculous trickle of water slipped down his throat . " Ah , " Jack said . " What makes water so delicious ? " " The western wind , " Wolf promptly replied . Jack opened his eyes wider . The swarm and dazzle resolved into the weathered brown of the shed and the mixed green and lighter brown of the gully . His head rested against Wolf 's shoulder . The bulge of Wolf 's stomach pressed into his backbone . " Are you okay , Wolf ? " he asked . " Did you get enough to eat ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . He patted the boy 's thigh . " Thanks for bringing me those pieces of meat . " " I promised . You were the herd . Remember ? " " Oh , yes , I remember , " Jack said . " Can I have some more of that water ? " He slid off Wolf 's huge lap and sat on the ground , where he could face him . Wolf handed him the cup . The John Lennon glasses were back ; Wolf 's beard was now little more than a scurf covering his cheeks ; his black hair , though still long and greasy , fell well short of his shoulders . Wolf 's face was friendly and peaceful , almost tired-looking . Over the bib overallshe wore a gray sweatshirt , about two sizes too small , with INDIANA UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT stencilled on the front . He looked more like an ordinary human being than at any other time since he and Jack had met . He did not look as if he could have made it through the simplest college course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . Jack sipped again  --  Wolf 's hand hovered above the rusty tin cup , ready to snatch it away if Jack gulped . " You 're really okay ? " " Right here and now , " Wolf said . He rubbed his other hand over his belly , so distended that it stretched the fabric at the bottom of the sweatshirt as taut as a hand would a rubber glove . " Just tired . Little sleep , Jack . Right here and now . " " Where 'd you get the sweatshirt ? " " It was hanging on a line , " Wolf said . " Cold here , Jacky . " " You did n't hurt any people , did you ? " " No people . Wolf ! Drink that water slow , now . " His eyes disconcertinglyshaded into happy Halloween orange for a second , and Jack saw that Wolf could never really be said to resemble an ordinary human being . Then Wolf opened his wide mouth and yawned . " Little sleep . " He hitched himself into a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was almost immediately asleep.  |p281By  two o'clock that afternoon they were a hundred miles west , and Jack Sawyer felt as if he too had been running with the moon  --  it had gone that easily . In spite of his extreme hunger , Jack sipped slowly at the water in the rusty can and waited for Wolf to awaken . Finally Wolf stirred , said , " Ready now , Jack , " hitched the boy up onto his back , and trotted into Daleville . While Wolf sat outside on the curb and tried to look inconspicuous , Jack entered the Daleville Burger King . He made himself go first to the men 's room and strip to the waist . Even in the bathroom , the maddeningsmell of grilling meat caused the saliva to spill into his mouth . He washed his hands , arms , chest , face . Then he stuck his head under the tap and washed his hair with liquid soap . Crumpled paper towels fell , one after the other , to the floor . At last he was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him while he gave his order  --  his wet hair , he thought . While she waited for the order to come through , the girl stepped back and leaned against the service hatch , still unabashedly looking at him . He was biting into the first Whopper as he turned away toward the glass doors . Juice ran down his chin . He was so hungry he could scarcely bother to chew . Three enormous bites took most of the big sandwich . I le had just worked his mouth far enough around the remainder to take a fourth when he saw through the doors that Wolf had attracted a crowd of children . The meat congealed in his mouth , and his stomach slammed shut . Jack hurried outside , still trying to swallow his mouthful of ground huck , limp bread , pickles , lettuce , tomatoes , and sauce . The kids stood in the street on three sides of Wolf , staring at him every bit as frankly as the waitress had stared at Jack . Wolf had hunched down on the urh as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his neck like a turtle . His ears seemed flattened against his head . The wad of food stuck in Jack 's throat like a golfball , and when he swallowed convulsively , it dropped down another notch.  |p282Wolf  glanced at him out of the side of his eye , and visibly relaxed . A tall blue-jeaned man in his twenties opened the door of a battered red pick-up five or six feet away down the curb , leaned against the cab , and watched , smiling . " Have a burger , Wolf , " Jack said as carelessly as he could . He handed Wolf the box , which Wolf sniffed . Then Wolf lifted his head and took a huge bite out of the box . He began methodicallyto chew . The children , astounded and fascinated , stepped nearer . A few of them were giggling . " What is he ? " asked a little girl with blond pigtails tied with fuzzy pink gift-wrapping yarn . " Is he a monster ? " A crewcut boy of seven or eight shoved himself in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't he ? He 's really the Hulk . Hey ? Hey ? Huh ? Right ? " Wolf had managed to extract what was left of his Whopper from its cardboard container . He pushed the whole thing into his mouth with his palm . Shreds of lettuce fell between his upraised knees , mayonnaise and meat juices smeared over his chin , his cheek . Everything else became a brownish pulp smacked to death between Wolf 's enormous teeth . When he swallowed he started to lick the inside of the box . Jack gently took the container out of his hands . " No , he 's just my cousin . He 's not a monster , and he 's not the Hulk . Why do n't you kids get away and leave us alone , huh ? Go on . Leave us alone . " They continued to stare . Wolf was now licking his fingers . " If you keep on gawping at him like that , you might make him mad . I do n't know what he 'd do if he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Banner 's transformation often enough to have an idea of what anger might do to this monstrous Burger King carnivore . He stepped back . Most of the others moved back with him . " Go on , please , " Jack said , but the children had frozen again . Wolf rose up mountainously , his fists clenched . " GOD POUND YOU , DO N'T LOOK AT ME ! " he bellowed . " DO N'T MAKE ME FEEL FUNNY ! EVERYBODY MAKES ME FEEL FUNNY ! " The children scattered . Breathing hard , red-faced , Wolf stood and watched them disappear up Daleville 's Main Street and around the corner . When they were gone , he wrapped his arms around his chest and looked dartingly at Jack . He was miserable with embarrassment . " Wolf should n't have yelled , " he said . " They were just little ones . " " Big fat scare 'll do them a lot of good , " a voice said , and Jack saw that the young man from the red pick-up was still leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like that before myself . Cousins , are you ? " Jack nodded suspiciously.  | " Hey , I did n't mean to get personal or anything . " He stepped forward , an easy , dark-haired young man in a sleeveless down vest and a plaid shirt . " I especially do n't want to make anybody feel funny now , ya know . " He paused , lifted his hands , palm-out . " Really . I was just thinking that you guys look like you 've been on the road awhile . " Jack glanced at Wolf , who was still hugging himself in embarrassment but also glowering through his round glasses at this figure . " I 've been there myself , " the man said . " Hey , dig it  --  the year I got out of good old DHS  --  Daleville High , you know  --  I hitched all the way to northern California and all the way back . Anyhow , if you 're sort of going west , I can give you a lift . " " Ca n't , Jacky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How far west ? " Jack asked . " We 're trying to make it to Springfield . I have a friend in Springfield . " " Hey , no probleema , seenyor . " He raised his hands again . " I 'm going just this side of Cayuga , right next to the Illinois border . You let me scarf a burger , we gone . Straight shot . An hour and a half , maybe less  --  you 'll be about halfway to Springfield . " " Ca n't , " Wolf rasped again . " There 's one problem , okay ? I got some stuff on the front seat . One of you guys 'll have to ride behind . It 's gon na be windy back there . " " You do n't know how great that is , " Jack said , speaking nothing more than the truth . " We 'll see you when you come back out . " Wolf began to dance in agitation . " Honest . We 'll be out here , mister . And thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man went through the doors . And so when the young man  --  Bill " Buck " Thompson , for that was his name  --  returned to his pick-up carrying the containers for two more Whoppers , he found a sedate-looking Wolf kneeling in the open back , his arms resting on the side panel , mouth open , nose already lifting . Jack was in the passenger seat , crowded by a stack of bulky plastic bags which had been taped , then stapled shut , and then sprayed extensively with room freshener , to judge by the smell . Through the translucent sides of the bags were visible long frondlike cuttings , medium green . ( lusters of buds grew on these amputated fronds . " I reckoned you still looked a little hungry , " he said , and tossed another Whopper to Wolf . Then he let himself in on the driver 's side , across the pile of plastic bags from Jack . " Thought he might catch it in his teeth , no reflection on your cousin . Here , take this one , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went , Wolf delirious with joy to havep284the wind whipping past his head , half-hypnotized by the speed and variety of the odors which his nose caught in flight . Eyes blazing and glowing , registering every nuance of the wind , Wolf twitched from side to side behind the cab , shoving his nose into the speeding air . Buck Thompson spoke of himself as a farmer . He talked nonstop during the seventy-five minutes he kept his foot near the floor , and never once asked Jack any questions . And when he swung off onto a narrow dirt road just outside the Cayuga town line and stopped the car beside a cornfield that seemed to run for miles , he dug in his shirt pocket and brought out a faintly irregular cigarette rolled in almost tissuelike white paper . " I 've heard of red-eye , " he said . " But your cousin 's ridiculous . " He dropped the cigarette into Jack 's hand . " Have him take some of this when he gets excited , willya ? Doctor 's orders . " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the cab . " Thanks , Buck , " he called up to the driver . " Man , I thought I 'd seen something when I saw him eat , " Buck said . " How do you get him to go places ? Yell mush ! mush ! at him ? " Once Wolf realized that the ride was over , he bounded off the back of the truck . The red pick-up rolled off , leaving a long plume of dust behind it . " Let 's do that again ! " Wolf sang out . " Jacky ! Let 's do that again ! " " Boy , I wish we could , " Jack said . " Come on , let 's walk for a while . Someone will probably come along . " He was thinking that his luck had turned , that in no time at all he and Wolf would be over the border into Illinois  --  and he 'd always been certain that things would go smoothly once he got to Springfield and Thayer School and Richard . But Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unreal bloats and distorts whatever is real , and when the bad things started to happen again , they happened so quickly that he was unable to control them . It was a long time before Jack saw Illinois , and during that time he found himself back in the shed . The bewilderingly rapid series of events which led to the Sunlight Home began ten minutes after the two boys had walked past the stark little roadsign telling them that they were now in Cayuga , pop . 23,568 . Cayuga itself was nowhere visible . To their right the endless cornfield rolled across the land ; to their left a bare field allowed them to see how the road bent , then arrowed straight toward the flat horizon . Just after Jack had realized that they would probably have to walk all the way into town to get their next ride , a car appeared on this road , travelling fast toward them.  | " Ride in back ? " Wolf yelled , joyfully raising his arms up over his head . " Wolf ride in back ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong way , " Jack said . " Just be calm and let it pass us , Wolf . Get your arms down or he 'll think you 're signalling him . " Reluctantly Wolf lowered his arms . The car had come nearly to the bend in the road which would take it directly past Jack and Wolf . " No ride in the back now ? " Wolf asked , pouting almost childishly . Jack shook his head . He was staring at an oval medallion painted on the car 's dusty white doorpanel . County Parks Commission , this might have said , or State Wildlife Board . It might have been anything from the vehicle of the state agricultural agent to the property of the Cayuga Maintenance Department . But when it turned into the bend , Jack saw it was a police car . " That 's a cop , Wolf . A policeman . Just keep walking and stay nice and loose . We do n't want him to stop . " " What 's a coppiceman ? " Wolf 's voice had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speeding car was now coming straight toward him . " Does a coppiceman kill Wolfs ? " " No , " Jack said , " they absolutely never kill Wolfs , " but it did no good . Wolf captured Jack 's hand in his own , which trembled . " Let go of me , please , Wolf , " Jack pleaded . " He 'll think it 's funny . " Wolf 's hand dropped away . As the police car advanced toward them , Jack glanced at the figure behind the wheel , and then turned around and walked back a few paces so that he could watch Wolf . What he had seen was not encouraging . The policeman driving the car had a wide doughy domineering face with livid slabs of fat where he 'd once had cheekbones . And Wolf 's terror was plain on his face . Eyes , nostrils flared ; he was showing his teeth . " You really liked riding in the back of that truck , did n't you ? " Jack asked him . Some of the terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police car roared past  --  Jack was conscious of the driver turning his head to inspect them . " All right , " Jack said . " He 's on his way . We 're okay , Wolf . " He had turned around again when he heard the sound of the police car suddenly begin to grow louder again . " Coppiceman 's coming back ! " " Probably just going back to Cayuga , " Jack said . " Turn around and lust act like me . Do n't stare at him . " Wolf and Jack trudged along , pretending to ignore the car , which wcmcd to hang behind them deliberately . Wolf uttered a sound that was half-moan , half-howl . The police car swung out into the road , passed them , flashed its brakep286lights , and then cut in diagonally before them . The officer pushed open his door and got his feet planted on the ground . Then he hoisted himself out of the seat . He was roughly Jack 's height , and all his weight was in his face and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouldersthose of a normally developed man . His gut , trussed in the brown uniform like a fifteen-pound turkey , bulged out on both sides of the wide brown belt . " I ca n't wait for it , " he said , and cocked an arm and leaned on the open door . " What 's your story , anyhow ? Give . " Wolf padded up behind Jack and hunched his shoulders , his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his overalls . " We 're going to Springfield , officer , " Jack said . " We 've been hitching  --  Iguess maybe we should n't . " " You guess maybe you should n't . Hol-eee shit . What 's this guy tryinna disappear behind you , a Wookiee ? " " He 's my cousin . " Jack thought frantically for a moment  --  the Story had to be bent far enough to accommodate Wolf . " I 'm supposed to be taking him home . He lives in Springfield with his Aunt Helen , I mean my Aunt Helen , the one who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do , escape from somewhere ? " " No , no , nothing like that . It was just that  --  " The cop looked at him neutrally , his face sizzling . " Names . " Now the boy met a dilemma : Wolf was certain to call him Jack , no matter what name he gave the cop . " I 'm Jack Parker , " he said . " And he 's  --  " " Hold it . I want the feeb to tell me himself . Come on , you . You remember your name , basket case ? " Wolf squirmed behind Jack , digging his chin into the top of his overalls . He muttered something . " I could n't hear you , sonny . " " Wolf , " he whispered . " Wolf . Prob'ly I should have guessed . What 's your first name , or did they just give you a number ? " Wolf had squeezed his eyes shut , and was twisting his legs together . " Come on , Phil , " Jack said , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . But he had just finished saying it when Wolf pulled up his head and straightened his back and yelled , " JACK ! JACK ! JACK WOLF ! " " We call him Jack sometimes , " the boy put in , knowing it was already too late . " It 's because he likes me so much , sometimes I 'm the only one who can do anything with him . I might even stay there in Springfield a few days after I get him home , just to make sure he settles down okay . "  | " I sure am sick of the sound of your voice , Jack boy . Why do n't you and good old Phil-Jack get in the back seat here and we 'll go into town and straighten everything out ? " When Jack did not move , the policeman put a hand on the butt of the enormous pistol which hung from his straining belt . " Get in the car . Him first . I want to find out why you 're a hundred miles from home on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ah , officer , " Jack began , and behind him Wolf rasped , " No . Ca n't . " " My cousin has this problem , " Jack said . " He 's claustrophobic . Small spaces , especially the insides of cars , drive him crazy . We can only get rides in pick-ups , so he can be in the back . " " Get in the car , " the policeman said . He stepped forward and opened the hack door . " CA N'T ! " Wolf wailed . " Wolf CA N'T ! Stinks , Jacky , it stinks in there . " Ills nose and lip had wrinkled into corrugations . " You get him in the car or I will , " the cop said to Jack . " Wolf , it wo n't be for long , " Jack said , reaching for Wolf 's hand . Reluctantly , Wolf allowed him to take it . Jack pulled him toward the back seat of the police car , Wolf literally dragging his feet across the surface of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would work . Wolf got c lose enough to the police car to touch the doorframe . Then his entire body shook . He clamped both hands onto the top of the doorframe . It looked as though he were going to try to rip the top of the car in half , as a circus strongman tears a telephone book in two . " Please , " Jack said quietly . " We have to . " hut Wolf was terrified , and too disgusted by whatever he had smelled . He shook his head violently . Slobber ran from his mouth and dripped onto the top of the car . The policeman stepped around Jack and released something from a catch on his belt . Jack had time only to see that it was not his pistol before the cop expertly whapped his blackjack into the base of Wolf 's skull . Wolf 's upper body dropped onto the top of the car , and then all of Wolf slid gracefully down onto the dusty road . " You get on his other side , " the cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're gon na finally get this big bag of shit into the vehicle . " Two or three minutes later , after they had twice dropped Wolf 's heavy tine onscious body back onto the road , they were speeding toward Cayuga . " I already know what 's gon na happen to you and your feeb cousin , it he is your cousin , which I doubt . " The cop looked up at Jack in his tear view mirror , and his eyes were raisins dipped in fresh tar . All the blood in Jack 's body seemed to swing down , down in his veins ,  |p288and  his heart jumped in his chest . He had remembered the cigarette in his shirt pocket . He clapped his hand over it , then jerked his hand away before the cop could say anything . " I got ta put his shoes back on , " Jack said . " They sort of fell off . " " Forget it , " the cop said , but did not object further when Jack bent over . Out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split-seamed loafers back up on Wolf 's bare heel , then quickly snatched the joint out of his pocket and popped it in his mouth . He bit into it , and dry crumbly particles with an oddly herbal taste spilled over his tongue . Jack began to grind them between his teeth . Something scratched down into his throat , and he convulsively jerked upright , put his hand in front of his mouth , and tried to cough with his lips together . When his throat was clear , he hurriedly swallowed all of the dampened , now rather sludgy marijuana . Jack ran his tongue over his teeth , collecting all the flecks and traces . " You got a few surprises ahead of you , " the policeman said . " You 're gon na get a little sunlight in your soul . " " Sunlight in my soul ? " Jack asked , thinking that the cop had seen him stuff the joint into his mouth . " A few blisters on your hands , too , " the cop said , and glared happily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cayuga Municipal Building was a shadowy maze of unlighted hallwaysand narrow staircases that seemed to wind unexpectedly upward alongside equally narrow rooms . Water sang and rumbled in the pipes . " Let me explain something to you kids , " the policeman said , ushering them toward the last staircase to their right . " You 're not under arrest . Got that ? You are being detained for questioning . I do n't want to hear any bullshit about one phone call . You 're in limbo until you tell us who you are and what you 're up to , " the cop went on . " You hear me ? Limbo . Nowhere . We 're gon na see Judge Fairchild , he 's the magistrate , and if you do n't tell us the truth , you 're gon na pay some big fuckin consequences . Upstairs . Move it ! " At the top of the stairs the policeman pushed a door open . A middleagedwoman in wire glasses and a black dress looked up from a typewriter placed sideways against the far wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell him we 're here . " She nodded , picked up her telephone , and spoke a few words . " You may go in , " the secretary said to them , her eyes wandering from Wolf to Jack and back again . The cop pushed them across the anteroom and opened the door to a room twice as large , lined with books on one long wall , framed pho/tographs and diplomas and certificates on another . Blinds had been lowered across the long windows opposite . A tall skinny man in a dark suit , a wrinkled white shirt , and a narrow tie of no discernible pattern stood up behind a chipped wooden desk that must have been six feet long . The man 's face was a relief map of wrinkles , and his hair was so black it must have been dyed . Stale cigarette smoke hung visibly in the air . " Well , what have we got here , Franky ? " His voice was startlingly deep , almost theatrical . " Kids I picked up on French Lick Road , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contorted into a smile as he looked at jack . " You have any identification papers on you , son ? " " No sir , " Jack said . " Have you told Officer Williams here the truth about everything ? He does n't think you have , or you would n't be here . " " Yes sir , " Jack said . " Then tell me your story . " He walked around his desk , disturbing the flat layers of smoke just over his head , and half-sat , half-leaned on the front corner nearest Jack . Squinting , he lit a cigarette Jack saw the Judge 's recessed pale eyes peering at him through the smoke and knew there was no charity in them . I t was the pitcher plant again. jack drew in a large breath . " My name is jack Parker . He 's my cousin , and he 's called Jack too . Jack Wolf . But his real name is Philip . He was staying with us in Daleville because his dad 's dead and his mother got sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Simple-minded , is he ? " " A little slow , " Jack said , and glanced up at Wolf . His friend seemed barely conscious . " What 's your mother 's name ? " the Judge asked Wolf . Wolf did not respond in any way . His eyes were clamped shut and his hands stuffed into his pockets . " She 's named Helen , " Jack said . " Helen Vaughan . " The judge eased himself off the desk and walked slowly over to Jack . " I lave you been drinking , son ? You 're a little unsteady . " " No . " Judge Fairchild came to within a foot of Jack and bent down . " Let me smell your breath . " Jack opened his mouth and exhaled . " Nope . No booze . " The judge straightened up again . " But that 's the only thing you were telling the truth about , is n't it ? You 're trying to string me along , boy . " " I 'm sorry we were hitching , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution now . Not only might what he said determine whether he and Wolf were to be let free , but he was having a little trouble forming the words themselves  --  everything seemed to be happening with great slowness . As in the shed , the seconds had wandered off the metronome . " In fact , we hardly ever hitch because Wolf  --  Jack , that is  --  hates being in cars . We 'll never do it again . We have n't done anything wrong , sir , and that really is the truth . " " You do n't understand , sonny , " the Judge said , and his far-off eyes gleamed again . He 's enjoying this , Jack understood . Judge Fairchild moved slowly back behind his desk . " Hitching rides is n't the issue . You two boys are out on the roads by yourself , coming from nowhere , going nowhere  --  real targets for trouble . " His voice was like dark honey . " Now we have here in this county what we think is a most unusual **25;12549;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up expressly for the benefit of boys like yourselves . It 's called the Sunlight Gardener Scripture Home for Wayward Boys . Mr. Gardener 's work with young fellows in trouble has been nothing short of miraculous . We 've sent him some tough cases , and in no time at all he has those boys on their knees , begging Jesus for forgiveness . Now I 'd say that was pretty special , would n't you ? " Jack swallowed . His mouth felt drier than it had been in the shed . " Ah , sir , it 's really urgent that we get to Springfield . Everybody 's going to wonder  --  " " I very much doubt that , " said the Judge , smiling with all his wrinkles . " But I 'll tell you what . As soon as you two wags are on your way to the Sunlight Home , I 'll telephone Springfield and try to get the number of this Helen . . . Wolf , is it ? Or is it Helen Vaughan ? " " Vaughan , " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fever . " Yes , " the Judge said . Wolf shook his head , blinking , and then put a hand on Jack 's shoulder . " Coming around are you , son ? " the Judge asked . " Could you tell me your age ? " Wolf blinked again , and looked at Jack . " Sixteen , " Jack said . " And you ? " " Twelve . " " Oh . I would have taken you for several years older . All the more reason for seeing you get help now before you get in real deep trouble , would n't you say , Franky ? " " Amen , " the policeman said . " You boys come back here in a month , " said the Judge . " Then we 'll see if your memory is any better . Why are your eyes so bloodshot ? "  | " They feel kind of funny , " Jack said , and the policeman barked . He had laughed , Jack realized a second later . " Take them away , Franky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone . " You 're going to be different boys thirty days from now . Depend on it . " While they walked down the steps of the red-brick Municipal Building , Jack asked Franky Williams why the Judge had asked for their ages . The cop paused on the bottom step and half-turned to glare up at Jack out of his blazing face . " Old Sunlight generally takes em in at twelve and turns em loose at nineteen . " He grinned . " You tellin me you never heard him on the radio ? He 's about the most famous thing we got around here . I 'm pretty sure they heard of old Sunlight Gardener even way over in Daleville . " His teeth were small discolored pegs , irregularly spaced . Twenty minutes later they were in farmland again . Wolf had climbed into the back seat of the police car with surprisingly little fuss . Franky Williams had pulled his sap from his belt and said , " You want this again , you fuckin freak ? Who knows , it might make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wrinkled up , but he had followed Jack into the car . He had immediately clapped his hand over his nose and begun breathing through his mouth . " We 'll get away from this place , Wolf , " Jack had whispered into his ear . " A couple of days , that 's all , and we 'll see how to do it . " " No chatter " came from the front scat . Jack was strangely relaxed . He was certain that they would find a way to escape . He leaned back against the plastic seat , Wolf 's hand wrapped around his , and watched the fields go by . " There she is , " Franky Williams called from the front seat . " Your future home . " Jack saw a meeting of tall brick walls planted surrealistically amidst the fields . Too tall to see over , the walls around the Sunlight Home were topped with three strands of barbed wire and shards of broken glass set in cement . The car was now driving past exhausted fields borderedwith fences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got sixty acres out here , " Williams said . " And all of it is either walled or fenced  --  you better believe it . Boys did it themselves . " A wide iron gate interrupted the expanse of wall where the drive turned into the Home 's property . As soon as the police car turned intop292the drive , the gates swung open , triggered by some electronic signal . " TV camera , " the policeman explained . " They 're a-waitin for you two fresh fish . " Jack leaned forward and put his face to the window . Boys in denim jackets worked in the long fields to either side , hoeing and raking , pushing wheelbarrows . " You two shitheads just earned me twenty bucks , " Williams said . " Plus another twenty for Judge Fairchild . Ai n't that great ? "  |p293The  Home looked like something made from a child 's blocks , Jack thought  --  it had grown randomly as more space was needed . Then he saw that the numerous windows were barred , and the sprawling building immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys in the fields had put down their tools to watch the progress of the police car . Franky Williams pulled up into the wide , rounded end of the drive . As soon as he had cut off his engine , a tall figure stepped through the front door and stood regarding them from the top of the steps , his hands knitted together before him . Beneath a full head of longish wavy white hair , the man 's face seemed unrealistically youthful  --  as if these chipped , vitally masculine features had been created or at least assisted by plastic surgery . It was the face of a man who could sell anything , anywhere , to anybody . His clothes were as white as his hair : white suit , white shoes , white shirt , and a trailing white silk scarf around his neck . As Jack and Wolf got out of the back seat , the man in white pulled a pair of dark green sunglasses from his suitpocket , put them on , and appeared to examine the two boys for a moment before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the sunglasses and put them back in his pocket . " Well , " he said . " Well , well , well . Where would we all be without you , Officer Williams ? " " Afternoon , Reverend Gardener , " the policeman said . " Is it the usual sort of thing , or were these two bold fellows actually engaged in criminal activity ? " " Vagrants , " said the cop . Hands on hips , he squinted up at Gardener as if all that whiteness hurt his eyes . " Refused to give Fairchild their right names . This one , the big one , " he said , pointing a thumb at Wolf , " he would n't talk at all . I had to nail him in the head just to get him in the car . " Gardener shook his head tragically . " Why do n't you bring them upp294here so they can introduce themselves , and then we 'll take care of the various formalities . Is there any reason why the two of them should look so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just that I cracked that big one behind the ears . " " Ummmmm . " Gardener stepped backward , steepling his fingers before his chest . As Williams prodded the boys up the steps to the long porch , Gardenercocked his head and regarded his new arrivals . Jack and Wolf reached the top of the steps and moved tentatively onto the surface of the porch . Franky Williams wiped his forehead and huffed himself up beside them . Gardener was smiling mistily , but his eyes switched back and forth between the boys . The second after something hard , cold , and familiar jumped out of his eyes at Jack , the Reverend again twitched the sunglasses out of his pocket and put them on . The smile remained misty and delicate , but even wrapped as he was in a sense of false security , Jack felt frozen by that glance  --  because he had seen it before . Reverend Gardener pulled the sunglasses below the bridge of his nose and peered playfully over the tops of the frames . " Names ? Names ? Might we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Jack , " the boy said , and then stopped  --  he did not want to say one more word until he had to . Reality seemed to fold and buckle about Jack for a moment : he felt that he had been jerked back into the Territories , but that now the Territories were evil and threatening , and that foul smoke , jumping flames , the screams of tortured bodies filled the air . A powerful hand closed over his elbow and held him upright . Instead of the foulness and smoke , Jack smelled some heavy sweet cologne , applied too liberally . A pair of melancholy gray eyes were looking directly into his . " And have you been a bad boy , Jack ? Have you been a very bad boy ? " " No , we were just hitching , and  --  " " I think you 're a trifle stoned , " said the Reverend Gardener . " We 'll have to see that you get some special attention , wo n't we ? " The hand released his elbow ; Gardener stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " You do possess a last name , I imagine . " " Parker , " Jack said . " Yesss . " Gardener whipped the glasses off his head , executed a dancinglittle half-turn , and was scrutinizing Wolf . He had given no indication whether he believed Jack or not . " My , " he said . " You 're a healthy specimen , are n't you ? Positively strapping . We 'll certainly be able to find a use for a big strong boy likep295you around here , praise the Lord . And might I ask you to emulate Mr. Jack Parker here , and give me your name ? " Jack looked uneasily at Wolf . His head was bowed , and he was breathingheavily . A glistening line of slobber went from the corner of his mouth to his chin . A black smudge , half-dirt , half-grease , covered the front of the stolen Athletic Department sweatshirt . Wolf shook his head , but the gesture seemed to have no content  --  he might have been shaking away a fly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Bill ? Paul ? Art ? Sammy ? No  --  something exceedingly foursquare , I 'm sure . George , perhaps ? " " Wolf , " said Wolf . " Ah , that is nice . " Gardener beamed at both of them . " Mr. Parker and Mr. Wolf . Perhaps you 'll escort them inside , Officer Williams ? And are n't we happy that Mr. Bast is in residence already ? For the presence of Mr. Hector Bast  --  one of our stewards , by the way  --  means that we shall probably be able to outfit Mr. Wolf . " He peered at the two boys over the frames of his sunglasses . " One of our beliefs here at the ScriptureHome is that the soldiers of the Lord march best when they march in uniform . And Heck Bast is nearly as large as your friend Wolf , young Jack Parker . So from the points of view of both clothing and discipline you shall be very well served indeed . A comfort , yes ? " " Jack , " Wolf said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head hurts , Jack . Hurts bad . " " Your little head pains you , Mr. Wolf ? " Reverend Sunlight Gardener half-danced toward Wolf and gently patted his arm . Wolf snatched his arm away , his face working into an exaggerated reflex of disgust . The cologne , Jack knew  --  that heavy cloying odor would have been like ammonia in Wolf 's sensitive nostrils . " Never mind , son , " said Gardener , seemingly unaffected by Wolf 's withdrawal from him . " Mr. Bast or Mr. Singer , our other steward , will see to that inside . Frank , I thought I told you to get them into the Home . " Officer Williams reacted as if he had been jabbed in the back with a pin . His face grew more feverish , and he jerked his peculiar body across the porch to the front door . Sunlight Gardener twinkled at Jack again , and the boy saw that all his dandified animation was only a kind of sterile self-amusement : the man in white was cold and crazy within . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to rest against the base of his thumb . Jack heard the whistle of a whip cutting through the air , and this time he recognized Gardener 's dark gray eyes . Gardener was Osmond 's Twinner.  | " Inside , young fellows , " Gardener said , half-bowing and indicating the open door . " By the way , Mr. Parker , " Gardener said , once they had gone in , " is it possible that we 've met before ? There must be some reason you look so familiar to me , must n't there ? " " I do n't know , " Jack said , looking carefully around the odd interior of the Scripture Home . Long couches covered with a dark blue fabric sat against the wall on the forest-green carpet ; two massive leather-topped desks had been placed against the opposite wall . At one of the desks a pimply teenager glanced at them dully , then returned to the video screen before him , where a TV preacher was inveighing against rock and roll . The teenage boy seated at the adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was slim and black-haired and his narrow face looked clever and bad-tempered . To the pocket of his white turtleneck sweater was pinned a rectangular nameplate of the sort worn by soldiers : SINGER . " But I do think we have met each other somewhere , do n't you , my lad ? I assure you , we must have  --  I do n't forget , I am literally incapable of forgetting , the face of a boy I have encountered . Have you ever been in trouble before this , Jack ? " Jack said , " I never saw you before . " Across the room , a massive boy had lifted himself off one of the blue couches and was now standing at attention . He too wore a white turtlenecksweater and a military nameplate . His hands wandered nervously from his sides to his belt , into the pockets of his blue jeans , back to his sides . He was at least six-three and seemed to weigh nearly three hundred pounds . Acne burned across his cheeks and forehead . This , clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to me later , " Sunlight Gardener said . " Heck , come up here and help our new arrivals at the desk , will you ? " Bast lumbered forward , scowling . He made a point of coming up very close to Wolf before he sidestepped past him , scowling more fiercely all the while  --  if Wolf had opened his eyes , which he did not , he would have seen no more than the ravaged moonscape of Bast 's forehead and the mean small eyes , like a bear 's eyes , bulging up at him from beneath crusty brows . Bast switched his gaze to Jack , muttered , " C'm on , " and flapped a hand toward the desk . " Registration , then take them up to the laundry for clothes , " Gardener said in a flat voice . He smiled with chromelike brilliance at Jack . " Jackp297Parker , " he said softly . " I wonder who you really are , Jack Parker . Bast , make sure everything is out of his pockets . " Bast grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams and languidly withdrew a long leather wallet from his jacket 's inside pocket . Jack saw him begin to count money out into the policeman 's hands . " Pay attention , snotface , " said the boy behind the desk , and Jack snapped around to face him . The boy was playing with a pencil , the smirk on his face an utterly inadequate disguise for what seemed to Jack 's keyed-up perceptions his characteristic anger  --  a rage that bubbledfar down within him , eternally stoked . " Can he write ? " " Jeez , I do n't think so , " Jack said . " Then you 'll have to sign in for him . " Singer shoved two legal-sized sheets of paper at him . " Print on the top line , write on the bottom one . Where the X 's are . " He fell back into his chair , raising the pencil to his lips , and slumped eloquently into its corner . Jack supposed that was a trick learned from the very Reverend Sunlight Gardener . JACK PARKER , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sheet . PHILIP JACK WOLF . Another scrawl , even less like his real handwriting . " Now you 're wards of the State of Indiana , and that 's what you 'll be for the next thirty days , unless you decide to stay longer . " Singer twitched the papers back toward himself . " You 'll be  --  " " Decide ? " Jack asked . " What do you mean , decide ? " A trifle of red grew smooth beneath Singer 's cheeks . He jerked his head to one side and seemed to smile . " I guess you do n't know that over sixty per cent of our kids are here voluntarily . It 's possible , yeah . You could decide to stay here . " Jack tried to keep his face expressionless . Singer 's mouth twitched violently , as if a fishhook had snagged it . ' This is a pretty good place , and if I ever hear you ranking it I 'll pound the shit out of you  --  it 's the best place you 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing : you got no choice . You have to respect the Sunlight Home . You understand ? " Jack nodded his head . " How about him ? Does he ? " Jack looked up at Wolf , who was blinking slowly and breathing through his mouth . " I think so . " All right . The two of you will be bunkmates . The day starts at five in the morning , when we have chapel . Fieldwork until seven , then break/fast in the dining hall . Back to the field until noon , when we get lunch plus Bible readings  --  everybody gets a crack at this , so you better start thinking about what you 'll read . None of that sexy stuff from the Song of Songs , either , unless you want to find out what discipline means . More work after lunch . " He looked sharply up at Jack . " Hey , do n't think that you work for nothing at the Sunlight Home . Part of our arrangement with the state is that everybody gets a fair hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you here  --  clothes and food , electricity , heating , stuff like that . You are credited fifty cents an hour . That means that you earn five dollars a day for the hours you put in  --  thirty dollars a week . Sundays are spent in the Sunlight Chapel , except for the hour when we actually put on the Sunlight Gardener Gospel Hour . " The red smoothed itself out under the surface of his skin again , and Jack nodded in recognition , being more or less obliged to . " If you turn out right and if you can talk like a human being , which most people ca n't , then you might get a shot at OS  --  Outside Staff . We 've got two squads of OS , one that works the streets , selling hymn sheets and flowers and Reverend Gardener 's pamphlets , and the other one on duty at the airport . Anyhow , we got thirty days to turn you two scumbags around and make you see how dirty and filthy and diseased your crummy lives were before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now exactly . " Singer stood up , his face the color of a blazing autumn leaf , and delicately set the tips of his fingers atop his desk . " Empty your pockets . Right now . " " Right here and now , " Wolf mumbled , as if by rote . " TURN EM OUT ! " Singer shouted . " I WANT TO SEE IT ALL ! " Bast stepped up beside Wolf . Reverend Gardener , having seen Franky Williams to his car , drifted expressively into Jack 's vicinity . " Personal possessions tend to tie our boys too much to the past , we 've found , " Gardener purred to Jack . " Destructive . We find this a very helpful tool . " " EMPTY YOUR POCKETS ! " Singer bawled , now nearly in a straightforward rage . Jack pulled from his pockets the random detritus of his time on the road . A red handkerchief Elbert Palamountain 's wife had given him when she 'd seen him wipe his nose on his sleeve , two matchbooks , the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a total of six dollars and forty-two cents  --  the key to room 407 of the Alhambra Inn and Gardens . He closed his fingers over the three objects he intended to keep . " I guess you want my pack , too , " he said.  | " Sure , you sorry little fart , " Singer ranted , " of course we want your foul backpack , but first we want whatever you 're trying to hide . Get it out  --  right now . " Reluctantly Jack took Speedy 's guitar-pick , the croaker marble , and the big wheel of the silver dollar from his pocket and put them into the nest of the handkerchief . " They 're just good-luck stuff . " Singer snatched up the pick . " Hey , what 's this ? I mean , what is it ? " " Fingerpick . " " Yeah , sure . " Singer turned it over in his fingers , sniffed it . If he had bitten it , Jack would have slugged him in the face . " Fingerpick . You tellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to me , " Jack said , and suddenly felt as lonely and adrift as he ever had during these weeks of travelling . He thought of Snowball outside the shopping mall , who had looked at him with Speedy 's eyes , who in some fashion Jack did not understand had actually been Speedy Parker . Whose name he had just adopted for his own . " Bet he stole it , " Singer said to no one in particular , and dropped the pick back into the handkerchief beside the coin and the marble . " Now the knapsack . " When Jack had unshouldered the backpack , handed it over , Singer pawed through it for some minutes in growing distaste and frustration . The distaste was caused by the condition of the few clothes Jack had left , the frustration by the reluctance of the pack to yield up any drugs . Speedy , where are you now ? " He 's not holding , " Singer complained . " You think we should do a skin search ? " Gardener shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf . " Bast shouldered up even closer . Singer said , " Well ? " " He does n't have anything in his pockets , " Jack said . " I want those pockets EMPTY ! EMPTY ! " Singer yelled . " ON THE ' FABLE ! " Wolf tucked his chin into his chest and clamped his eyes shut . " You do n't have anything in your pockets , do you ? " Jack asked . Wolf nodded once , very slowly . " He 's holding ! The dummy 's holding ! " Singer crowed . " Come on , you big dumb idiot , get the stuff out on the table . " He clapped his hands sharply together twice . " Oh wow , Williams never searched him ! Fairchild never did ! This is incredible  --  they 're going to look like such morons . Bast shoved his face up to Wolf 's and snarled , " If you do n't empty your pockets onto that table in a hurry , I 'm going to tear your face off . "  |p300Jack  softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned . Then he removed his balled right hand from its overall pocket . He leaned over the desk , brought his hand forward , and opened his fingers . Three wooden matches and two small water-polished stones , grained and striated and colorful , fell out onto the leather . When his left hand opened , two more pretty little stones rolled alongside the others . " Pills ! " Singer snatched at them . " Do n't be an idiot , Sonny , " Gardener said . " You made me look like a jerk , " Singer said in low but vehement tones to Jack as soon as they were on the staircase to the upper floors . These stairs were covered with a shabby rose-patterned carpet . Only the principaldownstairs rooms of the Sunlight Scripture Home had been decorated , dressed up  --  the rest of it looked rundown and ill cared for . " You 're gon na be sorry , I promise you that  --  in this place , nobody makes Sonny Singer into a jackass . I practically run this place , you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face into Jack 's . " That was a great stunt back there , the dummy and his fuckin stones . It 'll be a long time before you get over that one . " " I did n't know he had anything in his pockets , " Jack said . A step ahead of Jack and Wolf , Singer abruptly stopped moving . His eyes narrowed ; his entire face seemed to contract . Jack understood what was going to happen a second before Singer 's hand slapped stingingly over the side of his face . " Jack ? " Wolf whispered . " I 'm okay , " he said . " When you hurt me , I 'll hurt you back twice as bad , " Singer said to Jack . " When you hurt me in front of Reverend Gardener , I 'll hurt you four times as bad , you got that ? " " Yeah , " Jack said . " I think I got it . Are n't we supposed to get some clothes ? " Singer whirled around and marched upward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's thin intense back go up the stairs . You , too , he said to himself . You and Osmond . Someday . Then he followed , and Wolf trudged after . In a long room stacked with boxes Singer fidgeted at the door while a tall boy with a passionless bland face and the demeanor of a sleepwalker researched the shelves for their clothes . " Shoes , too . You get him into regulation shoes or you 're gon na be holding a shovel all day , " Singer said from the doorway , conspicuously not looking at the clerk . Weary disgust  --  it would have been another of Sunlight Gardener 's lessons.  |p301The  boy finally located a size thirteen pair of the heavy square black lace-ups in a corner of the storeroom , and Jack got them on Wolf 's feet . Then Singer took them up another flight to the dormitory floor . Here there was no attempt to disguise the real nature of the Sunlight Home . A narrow corridor ran the entire length of the top of the house  --  it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with inset eyelevelwindows marched down either side of the long corridor . To Jack , the so-called dormitory looked like a prison . Singer took them a short way up the narrow hall and paused before one of the doors . " On their first day , nobody works . You start the full schedule tomorrow . So get in here for now and look at your Bibles or something until five . I 'll come back and let you out in time for the confession period . And change into the Sunlight clothes , hey ? " " You mean you 're going to lock us in there for the next three hours ? " Jack asked . " You want me to hold your hand ? " Singer exploded , his face reddeningagain . " Look . If you were a voluntary , I could let you walk around , get a look at the place . But since you 're a ward of the state on a referral from a local police department , you 're one step up from beinga convicted criminal . Maybe in thirty days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime , get in your room and start acting like a human being made in God 's image instead of like an animal . " He impatientlyfitted a key into the lock , swung the door open , and stood beside it . " Get in there . I got work to do . " " What happens to all our stuff ? " Singer theatrically sighed . " You little creep , do you think we 'd be interested in stealing anything you could have ? " Jack kept himself from responding . Singer sighed again . " Okay . We keep it all for you , in a folder with your name on it . In Reverend Gardener 's office downstairs  --  that 's where we keep your money , too , right up until the time you get released . Okay ? Get in there now before I report you for disobedience . I mean it . " Wolf and Jack went into the little room . When Singer slammed the door , the overhead light automatically went on , revealing a windowless cubicle with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal chair . Nothing more . On the white Sheetrock walls yellowing tape marks showed where pictures had been put up by the room 's previous inhabitants . The lock clicked shut . Jack and Wolf turned to see Singer 's driven face in the small rectangular window . " Be good , now , " he said , grinning , and disappeared . " No , Jacky , " Wolf said . The ceiling was no more than an inch from the top of his head . " Wolf ca n't stay here . "  | " You 'd better sit down , " Jack said . " You want the top or the bottom bunk ? " " Hub ? " " Take the bottom one and sit down . We 're in trouble here . " " Wolf knows , Jacky . Wolf knows . This is a bad bad place . Ca n't stay . " " Why is it a bad place ? How do you know it , I mean ? " Wolf sat heavily on the lower bunk , dropped his new clothes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two pamphlets set out there . The book was a Bible bound in some artificial fabric that looked like blue skin ; the pamphlets , Jack saw by looking at those on his own bunk , were entitled The High Road to Everlasting Grace and God Loves You ! " Wolf knows . You know , too , Jacky . " Wolf looked up at him , almost scowling . Then he glanced back down at the books in his hands , began turning them over , almost shuffling them . They were , Jack supposed , the first books Wolf had ever seen . " The white man , " Wolf said , almost too softly for Jack to hear . " White man ? " Wolf held up one of the pamphlets , its back cover showing . The whole rear cover was a black-and-white photograph of Sunlight Gardener , his beautiful hair lifting in a breeze , his arms outstretched  --  a man of everlastinggrace , beloved of God . " Him , " Wolf said . " He kills , Jacky . With whips . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of his places . No Jack Sawyer , either . Never . We have to get away from here , Jacky . " " We 'll get out , " Jack said . " I promise you . Not today , not tomorrow  --  we have to work it out . But soon . " Wolf 's feet protruded far past the edge of his bunk . " Soon . " 3 . Soon , he had promised , and Wolf had required the promise . Wolf was terrified . Jack could not tell if Wolf had ever seen Osmond in the Territories , but he had certainly heard of him . Osmond 's reputation in the Territories , at least among members of the Wolf family , appeared to be even worse than Morgan 's . But though both Wolf and Jack had recognized Osmond in Sunlight Gardener , Gardener had not recognized them  --  which brought up two possibilities . Either Gardener was just having fun with them , pretending ignorance ; or he was a Twinner like Jack 's mother , profoundly connected to a Territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest level . And if that was true , as Jack thought it was , then he and Wolf could wait for the really right moment to escape . They had time to watch , time to learn.  |p303Jack  put on the scratchy new clothes . The square black shoes seemed to weigh several pounds apiece , and to be suited to either foot . With difficulty , he persuaded Wolf to put on the Sunlight Home uniform . Then the two of them lay down . Jack heard Wolf begin to snore , and after a while , he drifted off himself . In his dreams his mother was somewhere in the dark , calling for him to help her , help her.  |p304At  five that afternoon , an electric bell went off in the hallway , a long , toneless blare of sound . Wolf leaped from his bunk , thudding the metal frame of the upper with the side of his head hard enough to wake up Jack , who had been dozing , with a jolt . The bell stopped shrieking after fifteen seconds or so ; Wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , his hands wrapped around his head . " Bad place , Jack ! " he screamed . " Bad place right here and now ! Got ta get outta here ! Got ta get outta here RIGHT HERE AND NOW ! " Pounding on the wall . " Shut the dummy up ! " From the other side , a shrieking , whinnying , horsey laugh . " You gittin some sunlight in yo souls now , boys ! And from de way dat big fella soun , it sho feel fine ! " The giggling , whinnying laugh , too much like a horrified scream , came again . " Bad , Jack ! Wolf ! Jason ! Bad ! Bad , bad  --  " Doors were opening all up and down the hall . Jack could hear the rumble of many feet dressed in blocky Sunlight Home shoes . He got down from the top bunk , forcing himself to move . He felt cross-grained to reality  --  not awake , not really asleep , either . Moving across the mean little room to Wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt so tired now . . . so very tired . " Wolf , " he said . " Wolf , stop it . " " Ca n't , Jacky ! " Wolf sobbed . His arms were still wrapped around his head , as if to keep it from exploding . " You got to , Wolf . We have to go out in the hall now . " " Ca n't , Jacky , " Wolf sobbed , " it 's a bad place , bad smells .... " From the hallway , someone Jack thought it was Heck Bast  --  yelled , " Out for confession ! "  | " Out for confession ! " someone else yelled , and they all took up the chant : Out for confession ! Out for confession ! It was like some weird football cheer . " If we 're going to get out of here with our skins on , we 've got to stay cool . " " Ca n't , Jacky , ca n't stay cool , bad .... " Their door was going to open in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . maybe both . They were not " out for confession , " whatever that was , and while newcomers to the Sunlight Home might be allowed a few screw-ups during their orientation period , Jack thought their chances for escape would be better if they blended in as completely as they could as soon as they could . With Wolf , that was n't going to be easy . Christ , I 'm sorry I got you into this , big guy , Jack thought . But the situation is what the situation is . And if we ca n't ride it , it 's gon na ride us down . So if I 'm hard with you , it 's for your own good . He added miserably to himself , I hope . " Wolf , " he whispered , " do you want Singer to start beating on me again ? " " No , Jack , no .... " " Then you better come out in the hall with me , " Jack said . " You have to remember that what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer and that guy Bast treat me . Singer slapped me around because of your stones  --  " " Someone might slap him around , " Wolf said . His voice was low and mild , but his eyes suddenly narrowed , flared orange . For a moment Jack saw the gleam of white teeth between Wolf 's lips  --  not as if Wolf had grinned , but as if his teeth had grown . " Do n't even think of that , " Jack said grimly . " It 'll only make things worse . " Wolf 's arms fell away from his head . " Jack , I do n't know .... " " Will you try ? " Jack asked . He threw another urgent glance at the door . " I 'll try , " Wolf whispered shakily . Tears shone in his eyes . The upstairs corridor should have been bright with late-afternoon light , but it was n't . It was as if some sort of filtering device had been fitted over the windows at the ends of the corridor so that the boys could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but that the light itself was n't allowed to enter . It seemed to drop dead on the narrow inner sills of those high Victorian windows.  |p306There  were forty boys standing in front of twenty doors , ten on each side . Jack and Wolf were by far the last to appear , but their lateness was not noticed . Singer , Bast , and two other boys had found someone to rag and could not be bothered with taking attendance . Their victim was a narrow-chested , bespectacled kid of maybe fifteen . He was standing at a sorry approximation of attention with his chinos puddled around his black shoes . He wore no underpants . " Have you stopped it yet ? " Singer asked . " Shut up ! " One of the other boys with Singer and Bast yelled this last . The four of them wore blue jeans instead of chinos , and clean white turtleneck sweaters . Jack learned soon enough that the fellow who had just shouted was Warwick . The fat fourth was Casey . " When we want you to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You still whipping your weasel , Morton ? " Morton trembled and said nothing . " ANSWER HIM ! " Casey shrieked . He was a tubby boy who looked a little bit like a malevolent Tweedledum . " No , " Morton whispered . " WHAT ? SPEAK UP ! " Singer yelled . " No ! " Morton moaned . " If you can stop for a whole week , you 'll get your underpants back , " Singer said with the air of one conferring a great favor on an undeserving subject . " Now pull up your pants , you little creep . " Morton , sniffling , bent over and pulled up his trousers . The boys went down to confession and supper . Confession was held in a large bare-walled room across the way from the dining hall . The maddening smells of baked beans and hotdogs drifted across , and Jack could see Wolf 's nostrils flaring rhythmically . For the first time that day the dull expression left his eyes and he began to look interested . Jack was more wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf . Lying in his upper bunk with his hands behind his head , he had seen a black something in the upper corner of the room . He had thought for a moment or two that it was some sort of a dead beetle , or the husk of its shell  --  he thought if he got closer he would perhaps see the spider 's web the thing was caught in . It had been a bug , all right , but not the organic kind . It was a small , old-fashioned-looking microphone gadget , screwed into the wall with an eyebolt . A cord snaked from the back ofp307it and through a ragged hole in the plaster . There had been no real effort to conceal it . Just part of the service , boys . Sunlight Gardener Listens Better . After seeing the bug , after the ugly little scene with Morton in the hall , he had expected confession to be an angry , perhaps scary , adversary situation . Someone , possibly Sunlight Gardener himself , more probably Sonny Singer or Hector Bast , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs on the road , that he had broken into places in the middle of the night and robbed while on the road , that he had spit on every sidewalk he could find while on the road , and played with himself after a hard day on the road . If he had n't done any of those things , they would keep after him until he admitted them , anyway . They would try to break him . Jack thought he could hold up under such treatment , but he was n't sure Wolf could . But what was most disturbing about confession was the eagerness with which the boys in the Home greeted it . The inner cadre  --  the boys in the white turtlenecks  --  sat down near the front of the room . Jack looked around and saw the others looking toward the open door with a sort of witless anticipation . He thought it must be supper they were anticipating  --  it smelled very damn good , all right , especially after all those weeks of pick-up hamburgers interspersed with large helpings of nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the expressions of anticipation change to looks of gratification . Apparently it had n't been dinner they had been looking forward to , after all . Morton , who had been cowering in the upper hallway with his pants puddled around his ankles only fifteen minutes ago , looked almost exalted . The boys got to their feet . Wolf sat , nostrils flaring , looking puzzled and frightened , until Jack grabbed a fistful of shirt and pulled him up . " Do what they do , Wolf , " he muttered . " Sit down , boys , " Gardener said , smiling . " Sit down , please . " They sat . Gardener was wearing faded blue jeans overtopped with an open-throated shirt of blinding white silk . He looked at them , smiling benignly . The boys looked back worshipfully , for the most part . Jack saw one boy  --  wavy brown hair that came to a deep widow 's peak on his brow , receding chin , delicate little hands as pale as Uncle Tommy 's Delftware  --  turn aside and cup his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt some encouragement . Apparently not everyone 's head had been blown by whatever was going on here . . . but a lot of heads had been . Wide-open they had been blown , from the way things looked . The fellow with the great buck teeth was looking at Sunlight Gardener adoringly . " Let us pray . Heck , will you lead us ? "  |p308Heck  did . He prayed fast and mechanically . It was like listening to a Dial-a-Prayer recorded by a dyslexic . After asking God to favor them in the days and weeks ahead , to forgive them their trespasses and to help them become better people , Heck Bast rapped out , " ForJesussakeamen , " and sat down . " Thank you , Heck , " Gardener said . He had taken an armless chair , had turned it around backward , and was sitting on it like a range-ridin cowpoke in a John Ford Western . He was at his most charming tonight ; the sterile , self-referring craziness Jack had seen that morning was almost gone . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . Will you lead us , Andy ? " Warwick , an expression of ludicrous piety on his face , took Heck 's place . " Thank you , Reverend Gardener , " he said , and then looked at the boys . " Confession , " he said . " Who will start ? " There was a rustling stir ... and then hands began to go up . Two . . . six . . . nine of them . " Roy Owdersfelt , " Warwick said . Roy Owdersfelt , a tall boy with a pimple the size of a tumor on the end of his nose , stood up , twisting his rawboned hands in front of him . " I stole ten bucks from my momma 's purse last year ! " he announced in a high , screamy voice . One scabbed , grimy hand wandered up to his face , settled on the pimple , and gave it a fearful tweak . " I took it down to The Wizard of Odds and I turned it into quarters and I played all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone ! That was money she had put away against the gas bill , and that 's how come for a while they turned off our heat ! " He blinked around at them . " And my brother got sick and had to go in the hospital up in Indianapolis with pneumonia ! Because I stole that money ! " That 's my confession . " Roy Owdersfelt sat down . Sunlight Gardener said , " Can Roy be forgiven ? " In unison the boys replied , " Roy can be forgiven . " " Can anyone here forgive him , boys ? " " No one here . " " Who can forgive him ? " " God through the power of His only begotten Son , Jesus . " " Will you pray to Jesus to intercede for you ? " Gardener asked Roy Owdersfelt . " Sure am gon na ! " Roy Owdersfelt cried in an unsteady voice , andtweaked the pimple again . Jack saw that Roy Owdersfelt was weeping . " And the next time your momma comes here are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your little brother and against the face of God and you 're just as sorry a boy as ever there was ? " " You bet ! " Sunlight Gardener nodded to Andy Warwick . " Confession , " Warwick said . Before confession was over at six o'clock , almost everyone except Jack and Wolf had his hand up , hoping to relate some sin to those gathered . Several confessed petty theft . Others told of stealing liquor and drinking until they threw up . There were , of course , many tales of drugs . Warwick called on them , but it was Sunlight Gardener they looked to for approval as they told . . . and told . . . and told . He 's got them liking their sins , Jack thought , troubled . They love him , they want his approval , and I guess they only get it if they confess . Some of these sad sacks probably even make their crimes up . The smells from the dining hall had been getting stronger . Wolf 's stomach rumbled furiously and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearful confession of having hooked a Penthouse magazine so he could look at those filthy pictures of what he called " sexed-out women , " Wolf 's stomach rumbled so loudly that Jack elbowed him . Following the last confession of the evening , Sunlight Gardener offereda short , melodious prayer . Then he stood in the doorway , informal and yet resplendent in his jeans and white silk shirt , as the boys filed out . As Jack and Wolf passed , he closed one of his hands around Jack 's wrist . " I 've met you before . " Confess , Sunlight Gardener 's eyes demanded . And Jack felt an urge to do just that . Oh yes , we know each other , yes . You whipped my back bloody . " No , " he said . " Oh yes , " Gardener said . " Oh yes . I 've met you before . In California ? In Maine ? Oklahoma ? Where ? " Confess . " I do n't know you , " Jack said . Gardener giggled . Inside his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dancing and snapping a bullwhip . " So Peter said when he was asked to identify Jesus Christ , " he said . " But Peter lied . So do you , I think . Was it in Texas , Jack ? El Paso ? Was it in Jerusalem in another life ? On Golgotha , the place of the skull ? " " I tell you  --  " " Yes , yes , I know , we 've only just met . " Another giggle . Wolf , Jack saw , had shied as far away from Sunlight Gardener as the doorway wouldp310allow . It was the smell . The gagging , cloying smell of the man 's cologne . And under it , the smell of craziness . " I never forget a face , Jack . I never forget a face or a place . I 'll remember where we met . " His eyes flicked from Jack to Wolf  --  Wolf whined a little and pulled back  --  and then back to Jack again . " Enjoy your dinner , Jack , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Sunlight Home begins tomorrow . " Halfway to the stairs , he turned and looked back . " I never forget a place or a face , Jack . I 'll remember . " Coldly , Jack thought , God , I hope not . Not until I 'm about two thousand miles away from this fucking prisSomething slammed into him hard . Jack flew out into the hall , pinwheelinghis arms madly for balance . He hit his head on the bare concrete floor and saw a tangled shower of stars . When he was able to sit up , he saw Singer and Bast standing together , grinning . Behind them was Casey , his gut pouching out his white turtleneck . Wolf was looking at Singer and Bast , and something in his tensed-down posture alarmed Jack . " No , Wolf ! " he said sharply . Wolf slumped . " No , go ahead , dummy , " Heck Bast said , laughing a little . " Do n't listen to him . Go on and try me , if you want . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf and said , " Leave the dummy alone , Heck . He 's just the body . " He nodded at Jack . " There 's the head . There 's the head we got to change . " He looked down at Jack , hands on his knees , like an adult bending to pass a pleasant word or two with a very small child . " And we will change it , Mr. Jack Parker . You can believe it . " Deliberately , Jack said , " Piss off , you bullying asshole . " Singer recoiled as if slapped , a flush rising out of his collar , up hisneck , and into his face . With a growl , Heck Bast stepped forward . Singer grabbed Bast 's arm . Still looking at Jack , he said , " Not now . Later . " Jack got to his feet . " You want to watch out for me , " he said quietly to them both , and although Hector Bast only glowered , Sonny Singer looked almost scared . For a moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was both strong and forbidding  --  something that had not been there almost two months ago , when a much younger boy had set the small seafront town of Arcadia Beach to his back and had begun walking west.  |p311Jack  thought that Uncle Tommy might have described dinner  --  not unkindly  --  as consisting of American Grange Hall Cuisine . The boys sat at long tables and were served by four of their number , who had changed into clean mess-whites following the confession period . Following another prayer , chow was duly brought on . Big glass bowls full of home-baked beans were passed up and down the four tables , steaming platters of cheap red hotdogs , tureens of canned pineapple chunks , lots of milk in plain cartons marked DONATED COMMODITIES and INDIANA STATE DAIRY COMMISSION . Wolf ate with grim concentration , his head down , a piece of bread always in one hand to serve as a combination pusher and mopper . As Jack watched , he gobbled five hotdogs and three helpings of the bullethardbeans . Thinking of the small room with its closed window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas-mask tonight . He supposed so  --  not that he was likely to be issued one . He watched dismally as Wolf slopped a fourth helping of beans onto his plate . Following dinner , all the boys rose , formed lines , and cleared the tables . As Jack took his dishes , a Wolf-decimated loaf of bread , and two milk-pitchers out into the kitchen , he kept his eyes wide open . The stark labels on the milk cartons had given him an idea . This place was n't a prison , and it was n't a workhouse . It was probably classed as a boarding school or something , and the law would demand that some sort of state inspectors must keep an eye on it . The kitchen would be a place where the State of Indiana 's eye would fall most often . Bars on the windows upstairs , okay . Bars on the kitchen windows ? Jack did n't think so . They would raise too many questions . The kitchen might make a good jumping-off point for an escape attempt , so Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafeteria kitchen at his school in California . The floor and walls were tiled , the big sinks and counters stainless steel . The cupboards were nearly the size of vegetable bins . An old conveyorbeltdishwasher stood against one wall . Three boys were already operatingthis hoary antique under the supervision of a man in cook 's whites . The man was narrow , pallid , and possessed of a ratlike little face . An unfiltered cigarette was pasted to his upper lip , and that identified him in Jack 's mind as a possible ally . He doubted if Sunlight Gardener would let any of his own people smoke cigarettes . On the wall , he saw a framed certificate which announced that thisp312public kitchen had been rated acceptable under standards set by the State of Indiana and the U.S. Government . And no , there were no bars on the frosted-glass windows . The ratlike man looked over at Jack , peeled his cigarette off his lower lip , and tossed it into one of the sinks . " New fish , you and your buddy , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fish soon enough . The fish get old real quick here in the Sunlight Home , do n't they , Sonny ? " He grinned insolently at Sonny Singer . It was quite obvious that Singer did not know how to cope with such a smile ; he looked confused and unsure , just a kid again . - " You know you 're not supposed to talk to the boys , Rudolph , " he said . " You can just cram it up your ass anytime you ca n't roll it down the alley or kick it in the air , buddy-roo , " Rudolph said , flicking his eyes lazily over Singer . " You know that , do n't you ? " Singer looked at him , lips first trembling , then writhing , then pushing together hard . He suddenly turned around . " Night-chapel ! " he shouted furiously . " Night-chapel , come on , let 's go , get those tables cleared and let 's get up the hall , we 're late ! Night-chapel ! " The boys trooped down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The walls were dank plaster , and Jack did n't like the way Wolf 's eyeballs were rolling . After that , the cellar chapel was a surprise . Most of the downstairs area  --  which was considerable  --  had been converted into a spare , modernchapel . The air down here was good  --  not too warm , not too cold . And fresh . Jack could hear the whispering of convection units somewherenear . There were five pews split by a central aisle , leading up to a dais with a lectern and a simple wooden cross hung on a purple velvet backdrop . Somewhere , an organ was playing . The boys filed quietly into the pews . The microphone on the lectern had a large , professional-looking baffle on the end of it . Jack had been in plenty of studio sound-rooms with his mother , often sitting patiently by and reading a book or doing his homework assignments while she did TV overdubs or looped unclear dialogue , and he knew that sort of baffle was meant to keep the speaker from " popping " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the chapel of a religious boardingp313home for wayward boys . Two video cameras stood at either side of the lectern , one to catch Sunlight Gardener 's right profile , the other to catch his left . Neither was turned on this evening . There were heavy purple draperies on the walls . On the right , they were unbroken . Set into the left wall , however , was a glass rectangle . Jack could see Casey crouched over an extremely professional-looking sound-board , reel-to-reel tape recorder close to his right hand . As Jack watched , Casey grabbed a pair of cans from the board and slipped them over his ears . Jack looked up and saw hardwood beams rising in a series of six modest arches . Between them was drilled white composition board . . . soundproofing . The place looked like a chapel , but it was a very efficient combination-TV-and-radio studio . Jack suddenly thought of Jimmy Swaggart , Rex Humbard , Jack Van Impe . Folks , just lay yo hand on yo television set , and you gone be HEALED ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small door to the left of the podium opened , and Sunlight Gardener stepped out . He was dressed in white from head to toe , and Jack saw expressions varying from exaltation to outright adoration on the faces of many of the boys , but Jack again had to restrain himself from a wild laughing-spree . The vision in white approaching the lectern reminded him of a series of commercials he had seen as a very young child . He thought Sunlight Gardener looked like the Man from Glad . Wolf turned toward him and whispered hoarsely , " What 's the matter , Jack ? You smell like something 's really funny . " Jack snorted so hard into the hand cupped over his mouth that he blew colorless snot all over his fingers . Sunlight Gardener , his face glowing with ruddy good health , turned the pages of the great Bible on the lectern , apparently lost in deepest meditation . Jack saw the glowering , scorched-earth landscape of Heck Bast 's face , the narrow , suspicious face of Sonny Singer . He sobered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting up , watching Gardener alertly . And as Gardener raised his handsome face from his Bible and fastened his cloudy , dreaming , and utterly insane eyes upon his congregation , Casey flipped a switch . The reels of the big tape recorder began to turn . " Fret not thyself because of evildoers , " said Sunlight Gardener . His voice was low , musical , thoughtful.  | " Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity . For they shall soon be cut down like the grass , and wither as the green herb . Trust in the Lord , and do good ; so shalt thou dwell in the Territories  --  " ( Jack Sawyer felt his heart take a nasty , leaping turn in his chest ) "  --  and verily thou shalt be fed . Delight thyself also in the Lord ; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart . Commit thy way unto the Lord ; trust also in him ; and he shall bring it to pass ... . Cease from anger , and forsake wrath : fret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evildoers shall be cut off .  --  but those that wait upon the Lord , they shall inherit his Territory . " Sunlight Gardener closed the Book . " May God , " he said , " add His blessing to the reading of His Holy Word . " He looked down at his hands for a long , long time . In Casey 's glass booth , the wheels of the tape recorder turned . Then he looked up again , and in his mind Jack suddenly heard this man scream : Not the Kingsland ? You do n't mean to tell me you 've overturned a full wagonload of Kingsland Ale , you stupid goat 's penis ? You do n't mean to tell me that , do y000000uuuuuuu ? Sunlight Gardener studied his young male congregation closely and earnestly . Their faces looked back at him  --  round faces , lean faces , bruised faces , faces flaring with acne , faces that were sly , and faces that were open and youthful and lovely . " What does it mean , boys ? Do you understand Psalm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " No , their faces said  --  sly and open , clear and sweet , pitted and poxed . Not too much , only got as far as the fifth grade , been on the road , been on the bum , been in trouble . . . tell me . . . tell me . . . . Suddenly , shockingly , Gardener shrieked into the mike , " It means DO N'T SWEAT IT ! " Wolf recoiled , moaning a little.  | " Now you know what that means , do n't you ? You boys have heard that one , have n't you ? " " Yeah ! " someone shouted from behind Jack . " OH-YEAH ! " Sunlight Gardener echoed , beaming . " DO N'T SWEAT IT ! NEGATIVE PERSPIRATION ! They are good words , are n't they , boys ? Those are some kind of g000000d words , OH-YEAH ! " " Yeah ! ... YEAH ! " " This Psalm says you do n't have to WORRY about the evildoers ! NO SWEAT ! OH-YEAH ! It says you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquity ! NEGATIVE PERSPIRATION ! This Psalm here says that if you WALK the Lord and TALK the Lord , EVERYTHING'SGONNA BE SO COOL ! Do you understand that , boys ? Do you have an understanding ear for that ? " " Yeah ! " " Hallelujah ! " Heck Bast cried , grinning divinely . " Amen ! " a boy with a great lazy eye behind his magnifying spectacles returned . Sunlight Gardener took the mike with practiced ease , and Jack was again reminded of a Las Vegas lounge performer . Gardener began to walk back and forth with nervous , mincing rapidity . He sometimes did a jigging little half-step in his clean white leather shoes ; now he was Dizzy Gillespie , now Jerry Lee Lewis , now Stan Kenton , now Gene Vincent ; he was in a fever of jive Godhead testimony . " Maw , you do n't have to fear ! Ah , naw ! You do n't have to fear that kid who wants to show you dirty-book pictures ! You do n't have to fear that boy who says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and you 'll be a sissy if you do n't take it ! Ah , naw ! ' CAUSE WHEN YOU GOT THE LORD YOU GON NA WALK WITH THE LORD , AM I RIGHT ? " " YEAH ! ! ! " " OH-YEAH ! AND WHEN YOU GOT THE LORD YOU GON NA TALK WITH THE LORD , AM I RIGHT ? " " YEAH ! " " I CA N'T HEAR YOU , AM I RIGHT ? " " YEAH ! ! ! " They screamed it out , many of them rocking back and forth in a frenzy now . " IF I 'M RIGHT SAY HALLELUJAH ! " " HALLELUJAH ! " " IF I 'M RIGHT SAY OH-YEAH ! " " OH-YEAH ! " They rocked back and forth ; Jack and Wolf were rocked with them , helplessly . Jack saw that some of the boys were actually weeping . " Now tell me this , " Gardener said , looking toward them warmly andp316confidentially . " Is there any place for the evildoer here in the Sunlight Home ? Huh ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out the thin boy with the buck teeth . " That 's right , " Sunlight Gardener said , approaching the podium again . He gave the mike a quick , professional flick to clear the cord out from under his feet and then he slipped it back into the clamp again . " That 's the ticket . No room here for tattletale liars and workers of iniquity , say hallelujah . " " Hallelujah , " the boys replied . " Amen , " Sunlight Gardener agreed . " The Lord says  --  in the Book of Isaiah he says it  --  that if you lean on the Lord , you 're gon na mount upoh-yeah !  --  withwings as eagles , and your strength shall be the strength of ten and I say to you , boys , THAT THE SUNLIGHT HOME IS A NEST FOR EAGLES , CAN YOU SAY OH-YEAH ! " " OH-YEAH ! " There was another caesura . Sunlight Gardener gripped the sides of the podium , head down as if in prayer , gorgeous white hair hanging in disciplined waves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding . He did not look up . The boys listened breathlessly . " But we have enemies , " Sunlight Gardener said at last . This was little more than a whisper , but the mike picked it up and transmitted it perfectly . The boys sighed  --  a rustle of wind through autumn leaves . Heck Bast was looking around truculently , eyes rolling , pimples glowingsuch a deep red that he looked like a boy in the grip of a tropical illness . Show me an enemy , Heck Bast 's face said . Yeah , you go on , show me an enemy and just see what happens to him ! Gardener looked up . Now his mad eyes appeared filled with tears . " Yes , we have enemies , " he repeated . " Twice now the State of Indiana has tried to shut me down . Do you know what ? The radical humanists can barely stand to think of me down here at the Sunlight Home , teaching my boys to love Jesus and their country . It makes em mad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to know a deep old dark secret ? " They leaned forward , eyes on Sunlight Gardener . " We do n't just make em mad , " Gardener said in a hoarse conspirator 's whisper . " We make em scaaaaaared . " " Hallelujah ! " " Oh-yeah ! " " Amen ! " In a flash , Sunlight Gardener grabbed the mike again , and he was off ! Up and down ! back and forth ! sometimes he jigged a two-step neat asp317a minstrel in a 1910 cakewalk ! He bopped the word to them , pumping one arm first at the boys , then up toward heaven , where God had presumably dragged up His armchair to listen . " We scare em , oh yeah ! Scare em so bad they got to have another cocktail , or another joint , or another sniff of cocaine ! We scare em , because even smart old God-denying , Jesus-hating radical humanists like them can smell righteousnessand the love of God , and when they smell that they can smell the brimstone coming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell , oh no ! " So they send down an extra inspector or two to plant garbage under the kitchen counters , or to let loose some cock-a-roaches in the flour ! They start a lot of vile rumors about how my boys are beaten . Are you beaten ? " " NO ! " they roared indignantly , and Jack was dumbfounded to see Morton roaring the negative out as enthusiastically as all the rest , even though a bruise was already beginning to form on Morton 's cheek . " Why , they sent down a bunch of smart news reporters from some smart radical humanist news show ! " Sunlight Gardener cried in a kind of disgusted wonder . " They came down here and they said , Okay , who are we supposed to do the hatchet-job on ? We 've done a hundred and fifty already , we 're experts at smearing the righteous , do n't worry about us , just give us a few joints and a few cocktails and point us in the right direction . ' " But we fooled em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost vicious assent . " They did n't find no one chained to a beam in the barn , did they ? Did n't find no boys in strait-jackets , like they heard down in town from some of those hellbound School Board jackals , did they ? Did n't find no boys getting their fingernails pulled , or all their hair shaved off , or nothing like that ! Most they could find was some boys who said they got spanked , and they DID get spanked , oh-yeah , they was spanked and I 'd testify on that matter myself before the Throne of Almighty God , with a lie-detector strapped to each arm , because the Book says if you SPARE that rod , you gon na SPOIL that child , and if you believe that , boys , you gim me hallelujah ! " " HALLELUJAH ! " " Even the Indiana Board of Education , much as they 'd like to get rid of me and leave a clear field for the devil , even they had to admit that when it comes to spanking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs just about the same : that if you SPARE that rod , you gon na SPOIL that child ! " They found HAPPY boys ! They found HEALTHY boys ! They foundp318boys who were willing to WALK the Lord and TALK the Lord , oh can you say hallelujah ? " They could . " Can you say oh-yeah ? " They could do that , too . Sunlight Gardener came back to the podium . " The Lord protects those that love Him , and the Lord is not gon na see a bunch of dope-smoking , communist-loving radical humanists take away this resting place for tired , confused boys . " There were a few boys who told tattletale lies to those so-called news-people , " Gardener said . " I heard the lies repeated on that TV news show , and although the boys slinging that mud were too cowardly to show their own faces on the screen , I knew  --  oh-yeah !  --  I knew those voices . When you 've fed a boy , when you 've held his head tenderly against your breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , I guess then you know his voice . " Those boys are gone now . God may forgive them  --  I hope He does , oh-yeah  --  but Sunlight Gardener is just a man . " He hung his head to show what a shameful admission this was . But when he raised it again , his eyes were still hot , sparkling with fury . " Sunlight Gardener can not forgive them . So Sunlight Gardener set them out on the road again . They have been sent out into the Territories , but there they shall not be fed ; there even the trees may eat them up , like beasts which walk in the night . " Terrified silence in the room . Behind the glass panel , even Casey looked pallid and strange . " The Book says that God sent Cain out to the East of Eden , into the land of Nod . Being cast out onto the road is like that , my boys . You have a safe haven here . " He surveyed them . " But if you weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woe unto you ! Hell awaits the backslider just as it awaits the boy or man who dives into it on purpose . " Remember , boys . " Remember . " Let us pray . "  |p319It  took Jack less than a week to decide that a detour into the Territories was the only way they could possibly escape the SunlightHome . He was willing to try that , but he found he would do almost anything , run any risk , if only he could avoid flipping from the Sunlight Home itself . There was no concrete reason for this , only the voice of his undermind whispering that what was bad here would be worse over there . This was , perhaps , a bad place in all worlds . . . like a bad spot in an apple which goes all the way to the core . Anyway , the Sunlight Home was bad enough ; he had no urge to see what its Territories counterpart looked like unless he had to . But there might be a way . Wolf and Jack and the other boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was most of them  --  spent their days in what the long-timers called Far Field . It was about a mile and half down the road , at the edge of Gardener 's property , and there the boys spent their days picking rocks . There was no other field-work to be done at this time of year . The last of the crops had been harvested in mid-October , but as Sunlight Gardener had pointed out each morning in Chapel Devotions , rocks were always in season . Sitting in the back of one of the Home 's two dilapidated farm-trucks each morning , Jack surveyed Far Field while Wolf sat beside him , head down , like a boy with a hangover . It had been a rainy fall in the midwest , and Far Field was a gluey , sticky , muddy mess . Day before yesterday one of the boys had cursed it under his breath and called it a " real boot-sucker . " Suppose we just take off ? Jack thought for the fortieth time . Suppose I just yell " Go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buns ? Where ? North end , where those trees are , and the rock wall . That 's where his land ends . There might be a fence . We 'll climb over it . For that matter , Wolf can throw me over it , if he has to.  |p320Might  be barbed wire . Wiggle under it . OrOr Wolf could tear it apart with his bare hands . Jack did n't like to think of it , but he knew Wolf had the strength . . . and if he asked , Wolf would do it . It would rip up the big guy 's hands , but he was getting ripped up in worse ways right now . And then what ? Flip , of course . That was what . If they could just get off the land that belonged to the Sunlight Home , that undervoice whispered , they would have a fighting chance all the way clear . And Singer and Bast ( whom Jack had come to think of as the Thuggsy Twins ) would not be able to use one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn wheels into Far Field before the deep frosts of December would mire itself rocker-panel deep . It 'd be a footrace , pure and simple . Got to try it . Better than trying it back there , at the Home . AndAnd it was n't just Wolf 's growing distress that was driving him ; he was now nearly frantic about Lily , who was back in New Hampshire dying by inches while Jack said hallelujah under duress . Go for it . Magic juice or no magic juice . Got to try . But before Jack was quite ready , Ferd Janklow tried . Great minds run in the same channel , can you say amen . When it happened , it happened fast . At one moment Jack was listening to Ferd Janklow 's usual line of cynical , amusing bullshit . At the next , Ferd was pelting north across the murky field toward the stone wall . Until Ferd went for it , the day had seemed as drearily ordinary as any other at the Sunlight Home . It was cold and overcast ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air . Jack looked up to ease his aching back , and also to see if Sonny Singer was around . Sonny enjoyed harassingJack . Most of the harassment was of the nuisance variety . Jack had his feet stepped on , he was pushed on the stairs , his plate had been knocked out of his hands for three meals running  --  until he had learned to simultaneously cradle it on the inner side of his body and hold it in a death-grip . Jack was n't completely sure why Sonny had n't organized a mass stomping . Jack thought maybe it was because Sunlight Gardener was interested in the new boy . He did n't want to think that , it scared him to think that , but it made sense . Sonny Singer was holding off because Sunlight Gardener had told him to , and that was another reason to get out of here in a hurry.  |p321He  looked to his right . Wolf was about twenty yards away , grubbing rocks with his hair in his face . Closer by was a gantry-thin boy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donny grinned at him worshipfully , baring those amazing buck teeth . Spit dribbled from the end of his lolling tongue . Jack looked away quickly . Ferd Janklow was on his left  --  the boy with the narrow Delftware hands and the deep widow 's peak . In the week since Jack and Wolf had been incarcerated in the Sunlight Home , he and Ferd had become good friends . Ferd was grinning cynically . " Donny 's in love with you , " he said . " Blow it out , " Jack said uncomfortably , feeling a flush rise in his cheeks . " I bet Donny 'd blow it out if you let him , " Ferd said . " Would n't you , Donny ? " Donny Keegan laughed his big , rusty yuck-yuck , not having the slightestidea of what they were talking about . " I wish you 'd quit it , " Jack said . He felt more uncomfortable than ever . Donny 's in love with you . The bloody hell of it was , he thought that maybe poor , retarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and Donny was maybe not the only one . Oddly , Jack found himself thinking of the nice man who had offered to take him home and who had then settled for dropping him off at the mall exit near Zanesville . He saw it first , Jack thought . Whatever'snew about me , that man saw it first . Ferd said , " You 've gotten very popular around here , Jack . Why , I think even old Heck Bast would blow it out for you , if you asked him . " " Man , that 's sick , " Jack said , flushing . " I mean  --  " Abruptly , Ferd dropped the rock he had been working at and stood up . He looked swiftly around , saw none of the white turtlenecks were looking at him , and then turned back to Jack . " And now , my darling , " he said , " it 's been a very dull party , and I really must be going . " Ferd made kissing noises at Jack , and then a grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale face . A moment later he was in full flight , running for the rock wall at the end of Far Field , running in big gangling storklike strides . He did indeed catch the guards napping  --  at least to a degree . Pedersenwas talking about girls with Warwick and a horse-faced boy named Peabody , an Outside Staffer who had been rotated back to the Home for a while . Heck Bast had been granted the supreme pleasure of accompanyingSunlight Gardener to Muncie on some errand . Ferd got a good head-start before a startled cry went up :  | " Hey ! Hey , someone 's takin off " Jack gaped after Ferd , who was already six rows over and humping like hell . In spite of seeing his own plan co-opted , Jack felt a moment of triumphant excitement , and in his heart he wished him nothing but well . Go ! Go , you sarcastic son of a bitch ! Go , for Jason 's sake ! " It 's Ferd Janklow , " Donny Keegan gurgled , and then laughed his big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common room that night as they always did , but confession was cancelled . Andy Warwick strode in , announced the cancellation with abrupt baldness , and told them they could have an hour of " fellowship " before dinner . Then he strode out . Jack thought Warwick had looked , under his patina of goose-stepping authority , frightened . And Ferd Janklow was not here . Jack looked around the room and thought with glum humor that if this was " fellowship one with the other , " he would hate to see what would happen if Warwick had told them to have " a quiet hour . " They sat around the big long room , thirty-nine boys between age nine and age seventeen , looking at their hands , picking at scabs , morosely biting their nails . They all shared a common look  --  junkies robbed of their fix . They wanted to hear confessions ; even more , they wanted to make confessions . No one mentioned Ferd Janklow . It was as though Ferd , with his grimaces at Sunlight Gardener 's sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack found himself barely able to restrain an impulse to stand and scream at them . Instead , he began to think as hard as he ever had in his life . He 's not here because they killed him . They 're all mad . You think madness is n't catching ? Just look what happened at that nutty place down in South America  --  when the man in the reflector sunglasses told them to drink the purple grape drink , they said yassuh , boss , and drank it . Jack looked around at the dreary , indrawn , tired , blank faces  --  and thought how they would light , how they would kindle , if Sunlight Gardenerstrode in here  --  if he strode in here right here and now . They 'd do it , too , if Sunlight Gardener asked them to . They 'd drink it , and then they 'd hold me and Wolf , and they 'd pour it down our throats as well . Ferd was right  --  they see something on my face , or in it , something that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me a little . . . I guessp323that 's what pulled Heck Bast 's bell-rope , anyway . That slob is n't used to loving anything or anyone . So , yeah , maybe they do love me a little . . . but they love him a lot more . They 'd do it . They 're mad . Ferd could have told him that , and , sitting there in the common room , Jack supposed that Ferd had told him . He told Jack he had been committed to the Sunlight Home by his parents , born-again Christians who fell down on their knees in the living room whenever anyone on The 700 Club began to say a prayer . Neither of them had understood Ferd , who was cut from an entirely different bolt of cloth . They thought Ferd must be a child of the devil  --  a communistic , radical humanist changeling . When he ran away for the fourth time and was bagged by none other than Franky Williams , his parents came to the Sunlight Home  --  where Ferd had of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sight . Here was the answer to all the problems their bright , troublesome , rebellious son had caused them . Sunlight Gardener would educate their son toward the Lord . Sunlight Gardener would show him the error of his ways . Sunlight Gardener would take him off their hands and get him off the streets of Anderson . " They saw that story about the Sunlight Home on Sunday Report , " Ferd told Jack . " They sent me a postcard saying God would punish liars and false prophets in a lake of fire . I wrote them back  --  Rudolph in the kitchen smuggled the letter out for me . Dolph 's a pretty good guy . " He paused . " You know what the Ferd Janklow definition of a good guy is , Jack ? " " No . " " One who stays bought , " Ferd said , and laughed a cynical , hurt laugh . " Two bucks buys Dolph 's mailman services . So I wrote them a letter and I said that if God punished liars the way they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of asbestos longjohns in the other world , because he was lying about what goes on here faster than a horse can trot . Everything they had on Sunday Report  --  the rumors about the strait-jackets and about the Box  --  it was all true . Oh , they could n't prove it . The guy 's a nut , Jack , but he 's a smart nut . If you ever make a mistake about that , he 'll put a real hurt on you and on Phil the Fearless WolfBoyfor good measure . " Jack said , " Those Sunday Report guys are usually pretty good at catchingpeople with their hands in the pork barrel . At least , that 's what my mom says . " Oh , he was scared . He got real shrill and shrieky . Ever see Humphrey Bogart in The Caine Mutiny ? He was like that for a week before they showed up . When they finally got here he was all sweetness and reason ,                 @ @ @ @
