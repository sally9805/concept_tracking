Hospital Corp . of America pays its employees to keep fit by giving them bonuses for every mile they jog and every lap they swim . Control Data , the computer manufacturer , and Reader 's Digest have community gardens on company grounds where employees can grow their own vegetables . And , yes , there is a free lunch , at least for all workers at the Morgan Bank and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance . <P> These are some of the perks and quirks of corporate life discovered by Robert Levering , Milton Moskowitz and <P> Michael Katz , a team of San Francisco business journalists who set out to find the most contented employees in the U.S. They have published their conclusions in a breezy new book for job hunters called The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America ( Addison-Wesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out with a list of 350 companies that were recommended by executive recruiters , management consultants , business-school teachers and other sources . The authors then visited 114 companies that range in size from Celestial Seasonings , the herbal-tea maker , which has 200 workers , to IBM , the largest computer manufacturer , with 218,000 employees .

At Trammell Crow , the real estate developer , partners own a stake in the properties they manage . As a result , some 5% of the company 's employees are worth more than a million dollars . <P> Certain characteristics are common to most of the 100 companies . They tend to promote from within rather than hire outsiders . They try not to lay off employees in hard times . Above all , they make workers feel like part of a family . Nowhere is family spirit stronger than at Delta , which has not laid off anyone for nearly 40 years . In 1982 a retiring Delta pilot took out a full-page ad in both the Atlanta Constitution and the Journal ( cost : about $6,400 ) to declare , " It has been my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God has ever created .
