CULTURE HAS ITS built-in enemies envy , venality , hatred of difference , stupidity , bigotry , negligence . But these and other attitudes like them are such familiar old enemies , their ways so well known , that they are easy to spot and it is pretty clear what can and can not be done about them . Culture has another enemy , how-ever , which did not exist to any alarming degree before this century and yet is here to stay . Its ways are so imperfectly understood that many people either do not see it as a threat or else underestimate it . This enemy , which I call pseudoculture , seems to me no less dangerous than the others . My purpose here is to speculate on it and on the desolation it is capable of spreading . The root of the word culture means " to till , " that of the word create , " to grow . " Genuine culture , high or low , is connected with , comes out of , and reaches into our deepest nature . Pseudoculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not grow but is calculated together ; it is a product of ideology and technology , not of custom and tradition ; it so resembles the real thing that one can easily pay no attention to how or whether it is connected with our deepest nature . In 1953 , when media was still the plural of medium and television was so new that no adults had grown up with it , I visited a young air force couple who were putting in a miserable year in the Cotswold Hills in England . They disliked just about everything British , and the homesick young wife , pregnant for the first time and idle , was sentenced to watch the telly for hours every day . Among her many complaints against the BBC was its lack of advertising . At the time , I found her rancor against the British for depriving her of her TV commercials little more than funny , a matter of taste . But I never forgot that reaction of hers , and over the years 50 it ceased to be amusing . It took on a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred ( and still prefers ) advertising to art , and television to play , has come to seem less and less important ; instead , I keep wondering what goes on in one for whom such substitutions have been made . What happens to the self when pseudoculture substitutes for genuine culture ? Attending to the sublime I N ORDER TO IMAGINE reality , we must dream our own dreams . Among other things , pseudoculture interferes with our dreaming and thereby pollutes our imagining , especially our imagining of reality . A way to clarify what I mean by pseudoculture is to take a look at surrealism , at what it originally aimed to do and what has become of it . According to the surrealists , Freud taught us to use dreams to discover what the unconscious contains , which is far more real than what the conscious , rational mind apprehends . Art must destroy the stale rigidities of rationalism and do for mankind at large what dreams do for the dreamer . Dreamlike art will create a new reality superior to other realities . ( Pluralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is characteristic of the surrealists . ) This new reality should not just be a matter of art but can and should be part of our social , as well as of our inner , lives . The surrealist movement did not claim to invent dreamlike art in painting or in poetry ; what it did lay claim to was an assortment of techniques by which to achieve dreamlike effects . One of these techniques was automatic writing ? after Freud 's method of free association . Perhaps the most important of the techniques is juxtaposition , as explained in Andre Breton 's first Manifesto of Surrealism ( 1924 ) : The image is a pure creation of the mind . It can not be born from a comparison but from a juxtaposition of the two more or less distant realities . The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant and true , the stronger the image will be ? the greater its emotional power and poetic reality . In addition to automatic writing and juxtaposition , there are rhetorical techniques : Lewis Carroll 's scattering reasonable-seeming non-words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's causing elegantly constructed sentences to fade into and out of nonsense , leaving an exquisite fragrance of despair behind . And there is a whole bagful of visual , typographical , mechanical high jinks ? printing the same word all over a page or alternating lines in italics with lines in boldface ? that seemed a lot more energetic fifty years ago than they do now , after having been repeated thousands of times . Fundamentally , the strategy called surreal , whether in the verbal or the visual arts , combines lucidity and illogic in such ways as to conjure forth some of what psychoanalysis says is in the unconscious . In the hands of authentic , risk-taking artists able to Iook into themselves , surrealism has produced some considerable works of art . Outside the realm of genuine art , its overwhelming effect has been not to create a superior reality , as Breton and his fellow ideologues intended , not to enlarge and enrich , but to stultify ; what it produces is never a tale to add to the great store of tales , and seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cocteau 's Beauty and the Beast , but usually a Walt Disney prettification , neither out far nor in deep , a Bambi . That young air force wife , I conjecture , wanted her TV commercials not just because they were spry and fun , insulating her from the terrors and lusts they teased up in her , but also because watching television , commercials and all , for a sizable portion of her waking life accomplished for her something like the radical intention of surrealism , which aimed , according to Breton , to do no less than revolutionize human existence by altering the relation between dream and reality . In her , this relation had been altered . I conjecture that the main cause of the stultifying effect of surrealism in the great world has been motion pictures . Whatever it is that high art does , the cinema can do . But it also does a surreal thing no other art can do a hundredth as well , and its offspring television does this even better : it makes dream-substitutes . I mean literal dreams , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther King 's " I have a dream . " How extensively a movie or TV show can substitute for a dream is a matter of unprovable hypothesis ? more in some people than in others , of course . and never more than half . since a dreamer makes up his own dreams . But sometimes , especially in TV addicts , this substitution can be substantial . Consider : the viewer is physically passive , may be as inert as a sleeper ; the images can be hallucinatory in their vividness , and their sequence need have little or nothing to do with rational consciousness ; they can evoke , and can be calculated to evoke , strong emotions that do not follow from anything the viewer decided or did and that do not immediately cause him to choose or do anything . The crucial question is : How are these images connected with reality ? I argue that movies and TV shows , while having the power , need not and usually do not come from or reach into reality in any way that matters . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? methods honed by the surrealists ? not for the purpose of revealing a truth in disguise or of creating something beautiful or of playing or of doing most of the other things dreams and art do ; they do it , if not immediately then finally , for the purpose of selling something : sometimes a product , sometimes an idea , always themselves . We need dreams in order to keep in touch with ourselves . One who is chronically exposed to pseudodreams , voluntarily or not , is likely to lose touch with his deep self ; his imagination does not shape and unify but squanders in the shallows and swamps of daydreaming , becomes pastime fantasy ; his connections with reality become confused in many ways . One of these ways is his muddling propaganda and truth , that error without which the people can not be deformed into the masses . Another is his blurring his own memories . To remember fully is to imagine , and to daydream is to remember in a fog . Foggy memories , foggy self.p SEUDOCULTURE , HOWEVER , means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and attitudes that , when put into practice , interfere with people 's ways of being together . In this broader sense , pseudoculture 's ideology produces such notions as that masculine aggressiveness is pathological in nature and up to no good ? whence it follows that aggression is something to be cured , not put to use ; to be outlawed , not civilized ; only to be feared , not marveled at as well . One consequence of this attitude in America , where it prevails to some degree , is an ineptitude at magnificence ; we have made discouragingly few monuments of magnificence , and most of us , even the rich , have only the foggiest understanding of what magnificence is . Pseudoculture is great at defoliation ; it defoliates evil till all that is visible of it is bad guys ; success till all that is left of it is a pile of money ; communication till it is a colorless , odorless exchange of information ; injustice till it is that big stump , inequality ; guilt till it is guilt feelings . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider somewhat more amply one of pseudo-culture 's variations on love ? gourmet sex . In order to achieve literal sublimation , not the figurative kind for which Freud expropriated the word , mystics recommend that the pleasures of the senses be refused , especially sexual pleasures ? not repressed in Freud 's sense of the word , but deliberately suppressed , protecting the self from them so it will be free to attend to the sublime . Most people , however , as all religious systems acknowledge , are not capable of doing that ; indeed , the Enlightenment holds that the contemplatives did not do it either but just thought they did ; for example , V. S. Naipaul applies to Gandhi 's successor , Jawaharlal Nehru , the phrase " the stupor of meditation . " Puritans of every religion , aiming to get at everybody , teach that nearly all pleasure , and especially sexual pleasure , is sinful . As the Calvinist of the joke puts it , " We may not be able to keep our people from sinning , but we sure can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puritanism have lost authority among us ; believing , as we by and large do , that psychology knows , and religion does not know , what reality is , we relegate mysticism , or at least we try to relegate it , to history , India , and abnormal psychology ; and puritanism , having fallen into disrepute , has gone underground , though what it is doing down there I am not sure , nor how violently it will break out again , nor when . Pseudoculture teaches us not to sacrifice any sexual pleasure in the name of some higher good , since presumably there is none ; not homosexuality or sadomasochism is the perversion , but chastity . Now , to say pleasure is and should be one of the true sexual goods is not the same thing as saying it is the supreme sexual good ; to say that sacrificing sexual pleasure to a perhaps illusory religious belief is perverse is not the same thing as saying that every sacrifice of sexual pleasure is perverse . The subtitle to Alex Comfort 's joy of Sex should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of " to Making Love , " for , to the contemporary hedonist , the greatest threat comes not from puritanism or the ideal of chastity but from love . Love is still respectable , and it has strong advocates who hold that sexual pleasure , a splendid good in itself , serves the higher good of helping to connect two selves profoundly ; that is , pleasure helps to make love and keep love made . Furthermore , they hold that fidelity , too , helps to keep love made . Now , fidelity is a dangerous principle to a hedonist , for it entails sacrifice , giving up all those other partners for just this one . When pleasure is the highest good of sex , it does n't much matter which body or how many you get it with so long as you get it ; besides , variety is a source of pleasure in itself , and also reduces the hazard of loving some one personlong or deeply . In an age of the Pleasure Ethic , pornography , that depersonalizer , is a functional art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by divorcing sex from the self ; hence the popularity of pornography has increased , not diminished , as the prohibitions against it have been removed . To hedonism , faithful sexual love is an abomination because it not only can , and sometimes does , take you higher than pleasure ever can , thereby making pleasure a lesser thing , but also can , and probably sometimes will , take you down into the horrors as pleasure never does . So can love of your child do such things to you ; hence hedonism 's enthusiasm for abortion ? if you have to give up something , let it be an embryo , not your due allotment of orgasms . Love pulls us into reality , and reality is what pseudoculture likes least , what it is contrived to protect us from , but the trouble with reality is that it is always there , and every once in a while it may compel us to recognize that what we have been telling ourselves is not what is . When those who have lost faith in the exalted begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always assume that things must be worse than they seem , not better . Those who consider ecstasy a euphemism for orgasm , who think feeling guilty about it can atone for an injury done , whose dreams lie to them , learn to suspect that almost nothing is what it seems , not even such portions of reality as they are unavoidably confronted with from time to time . I love you even though ? or is it because ? ? you blame me for not loving you enough . I will try to love you more . But is it really love ? Is it really you I love ? The rock on which the sense of reality stands is one 's own emotions . Those who are unsure of what they feel , of how their feelings are connected with reality , are full of suspiciousness , are given to fantasies of conspiracy and persecution , are prey to delusions , to disorders of self-assertion . The madness that best characterizes our time is paranoia , or . in dilution , paranoid tendencies . An example is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Rainbow , which does not realistically portray complex characters who , among their other qualities , take a paranoid view of the world , nor does it sanely portray a mad world in the manner of great satire , nor does it , as Beckett does , perform astonishing arabesques in the narrow strand between lush paranoia and nothingness . Instead , it projects paranoia ? sometimes with enormous subtlety and force , paranoia being the madness by which the intellect can be most fully engaged and pressed into service . Malice flourishes in the dark of ignorance . Unsure of my own self , I am even less sure of your selves . You are my mirrors . The malice I cast at you I see as coming at me . You are guilty of my blame . Violations of the self 1 NTRINSIC TO PSECDOCULTURE , as I see it , is violation of the sense of intimacy ? that outreaching in mutuality which , when it is not sentimentalized or perverted , informs the deepening consciousness . Absolute violation of intimacy is an aspect of totalitarianism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to render intimacy impossible ( as in a concentration camp ) ; to make it an object of suspicion and hostility , as everywhere in a totalitarian state , to limit its choices with mass activities of all sorts , to put a taboo on privacy ? But this kind of assault is beyond what I mean by pseudoculture . I am interested in our homegrown , less directly obliterative varieties , the first of which , public intimacy , should be a satiric oxymoron but is instead bitterly literal . Familiar examples of public intimacy , of making public what ought to be kept private , are gossip columns , pornography , true-confession magazines . The camera also has made possible violations of the self that were not , could not have been , imagined before . The camera intrudes on ordinary people without their consent : the newspaper shot of the mother at the moment she learns her child has been killed . It encourages people who want celebrity that is , many people ? to do and say on camera what is normally done and said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by actors . Finally , the camera , along with the microphone , can become the object of gestures that should be offered in private only to another human being . There seems no end to the ways in which intimacy is violated , the sense of intimacy mangled . There is the how-to handbook of sexual intimacy ; the medical technician 's instant intimacy with a patient 's name ; the mass acceptance of voyeurism ; intimacy as therapy ; intimacy with Jesus , as though because he is a lamb he is not also a tiger . The kind I am most concerned about , however , I call mirror intimacy . Pseudoculture has been preaching mirror intimacy for years and shows no sign of letting up . It is everywhere about us . Two examples . In the June , 1979 , issue of Good Housekeeping there appeared a page of typographically free verse entitled " My Ideal Man , " by Dinah Shore. * The verse opens : " My ideal man is many men . " I assume she means , literally , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self of his otherness is likely to show , and the more you see of his self , the harder it is to use him as a mirror ; and , metaphorically , that if you conceive of a man as having many facets , each facet is usable as a mirror . What Dinah Shore does not want , at least does not say she wants , is one integrated man , the kind you see whenever you look at him , from whatever angle , no matter what else you were looking for . She goes on : " We will share . " What " we " will share she leaves unspecified , but why is clear ? so " he will care so much that/ For once I can tell him what is in my soul . " Nowhere does she say she will love her ideal man or that he will love her . " He will know/ My day begins and ends with him. /And that the way I treat my friends , my helpers , my dog , /My work , my play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " Not " how I feel about him " but " how I feel he feels about me . " Fortunately for Dinah , there are many men ? not all of them in show business ? who " - " My Ideal Man , " by Dinah Shore , copyright ? 1973 by Dinah Shore , reprinted by special permission of the author . want from their women what she wants from her man . What do mirrors do in bed with one another ? A new slick magazine called Self is devoted to instructing young women on how to be good to themselves ; a recent issue gives this quintessential advice : " Make love unto others as you would have them make love unto you . " Remember reactionary old Freud 's " Anatomy is destiny " ? Nous aeons change tout cela . More is less p SEUDOCULTURE regularly appropriates the goods of high culture and misuses them . Two I especially notice being violated for their depth of intimacy are realistic fiction and psychoanalysis , both of which assume the supreme value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , civilized people of sufficient intelligence and sensibility , as well as leisure , cultivate the art of intimacy ; when both the author and the characters of a story are of this disposition , the resulting fiction can be of a refinement as profound and exact as it is possible for the mind to imagine ? Lady Murasaki 's Tale of Genii , Proust 's Remembrance of Things Past , Henry James 's great fictions . To observe the limits such novelists respect , transgressions they do not make , mysteries of otherness they will not intrude on , is to understand right intimacy itself . For example , they do not share another 's sensory experience except as he can talk about it ; they leave unnamed some of the story 's most important motives and meanings : they take the reader up to the moment of a great choosing and then away from it ; they do not tie down , stultify , cramp with causation the conscience itself ; they leave their characters alone to choose in that darkness where the great moral choices are made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough , and not the least of the reasons why it is so expert at false intimacy is high fiction itself . Over the past generations of its great popularity , high fiction has taught many readers a taste for intimacy . So why not tinker with the rules a little here , a little there ? be unmistakably clear about what is right and what is wrong , for example , search every wound , make every decision a visible process , get in bed with lovers , such like ? That way , intimacy will be available to the masses . Of course it wo n't be the same any longer . Worse , they 'll get into the way of thinking that intimacy is easy and no more than their due ? in life as in novels . As for psychoanalysis : what Aquinas was to scholasticism in the thirteenth century , Freud is to psychology in the twentieth . Like scholasticism then , psychology permeates both what we apprehend of reality and also , to some degree , reality itself ; what you do to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with why you think he committed the crime , and that in turn frequently has more to do with what your philosophy tells you is there than with what really is there : if he 's possessed , beat the devil out of him ; if he did it of his own free will , punish him ; if he 's a danger to society , warehouse him ; but if , as liberal psychology teaches , he is mentally ill , heal him ? which mostly means keep him drugged . Psychoanalysis is an instrument which subtle people use in order to think superbly about inmost matters , which the crude use to know many things that can not be known , and which everybody can use to move in on everybody else . Freud has told us about our secret selves so much we had not known before , or had only half known , and he speaks with , and has been invested with , such authority that many think that what he says is there is what is there ? all that is there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because his therapeutic method involves a partial but extreme intimacy in which the patient may say anything without restriction ? any indecency , any accusation , any blasphemy , irrelevancy , craziness , betrayal of confidence ? and because this method works in treating certain otherwise intractable disorders , psychoanalysis has contributed to the blurring of the sense of intimacy , the sense of what nudity is appropriate there but not here , then but not now , with you alone and with no one else . Freud himself did not blur such distinctions . He knew how to make public a secret without betraying a confidence : he would tell it as a pseudonymous case history . Revering high civilization as he did and being , as he was , fully aware of the many forces , some of them in himself , that want to bring it down , wreck it , smear it , strip it ? he always dressed properly . You can be intimate with only a few friends , only with the few who know how to accept the privacies you offer them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can accept them ; and not even to these few friends , not even to one , do you tell everything . To tell many all is not being intimate , it is rubbing ; in this as in much of civilized life , the more the less . Those without intimacy have their identities assigned to them ? by biology , by the state , finally by pseudoculture.
