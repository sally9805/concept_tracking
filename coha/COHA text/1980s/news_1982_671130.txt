Mr. Shade says he now realizes that most of the crimes he committed were connected with alcohol . He is now , for the first time , being treated for alcoholism , as one of 250 men in a alcoholismtreatment program at Woodbourne , a medium-security prison in Sullivan County. // Like many other prisoners , Mr. Shade at first resisted being treated for alcoholism . " People - and I sure enough did - have the mistaken image of an alcoholic being a Bowery bum . " Mr. Shade said . " But I found out that alcoholics can be anyone . They can go around wearing a suit and tie . " <> <> More Than a Third Join // More than one-third of Woodbourne ' s 700 inmates are in the alcoholism-treatment program . There is a strong incentive to join ; prisoners are told it will help them gain parole. // " Parole is the stick , initially , " said Patrick Minucci , the director of the alcoholism-treatment program . " If we didn ' t have the stick of parole , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But eventually most of them see they need it. " // Mr. Shade said : " Everyone starts out with the idea that it will help with parole . " But then it hits you : ' Man , I need this . ' " Asked if he thinks he can make it on the outside when he is released , Mr. Shade paused for a moment , and then replied : " I think I can . I don ' t say I ' ll never drink , but like they say at A.A. , I ' ll just try to stay sober one day at a time . " <> <> Many Criminals Afflicted // Mr. Shade is one of what authorities say are many criminals with alcohol-related problems that cause them to commit crimes and make them hard to deal with in prison . It has been estimated that up to 40 percent - some say much more - of inmates have problems with alcohol , compared with less than 10 percent of the population as a whole. // Prison officials say the program has markedly eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too early to have significant statistics , but they say the program should help to keep alcoholics from getting drunk , committing crimes and going back to prison. // People who have been studying the problem say that while alcohol is associated with much crime , some prison officials have been wary of treating it. // " Treatment is a bad word to some people in correction , " said J. Kevin McNiff , chairman of New York State ' s Commission of Correction . " They feel that if they commit themselves to treatment , they ' d be in an uncertain area and they might fail and be criticized . " <> <> Estimates of the Problem // It is Mr. McNiff ' s estimate that as many as 40 percent of the state ' s 25 , 000 inmates have alcohol-related problems . Other estimates range to 65 percent , according to the report on drug abuse and alcoholism that was given to Governor Carey in June by Joseph A. Califano Jr. // The Woodbourne experiment began in 1975 . It offers individual and group counseling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a week. // The program has the strong support of the prison ' s superintendent , Robert H. Kuhlmann . <> <> Illicit Brewing Reduced // " We ' ve had many fewer infractions , " he said , in his prison office . " It ' s kept the making of home brew down drastically , and made the running of this instituition much more manageable . There have been fewer assaults on inmates and on officers by inmates bombed out on home brew. " // The program at Woodbourne was started by Buford Peterson , who is the executive secretary of the Fellowship Center , a New York City organization devoted to alcoholics who have been in prison . Mr. Peterson is a former alcoholic who says he spent years drunk and in prison. // Not everyone at Woodbourne accepts the alcoholism-treatment program . An inmate identified only as Joe is one of the doubters . Joe is 18 . He has curly blond hair , a wispy mustache and a quick , boyish smile . He is in Woodbourne because he got drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Prisoner Resists Program // Joe strongly denied that he needed treatment for his drinking even though his parole officer had told him that it would help him get his parole. // Joe started drinking when he was in the eighth grade , and quit school in the ninth . Joe scoffed at the prison ' s alcoholism-treatment program . " It ' s a joke , a waste of time , " he said . " They laugh at you if you ' re in the program , say you ' re a no-good drunk . There ' s enough trouble here without that too . I ' m no dummy . If I have a problem I can do it on my own. " // Joe talked about getting out of Woodbourne , about his girlfriend . " We lost our baby while I was in jail , " he said . " We want to be together again . A friend says he will give me a trailer to live in and I know a place in the mountains , in Woodstock , where I can put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother. " // Mr. Peterson entered the room and smiled at Joe . " I ' ve been through just what you have , " he told Joe . " I started when I was 14 . It ' s difficult to accept the fact that we have an illness . Do you feel alcohol has taken anything away from you ? " <> <> ' It Took My Father Away ' // " It took my father away and it took a few years off my life , " Joe answered . " What would you be doing now if it wasn ' t for alcohol ? " " I ' d be on the road to making money - legally , " Joe answered . " Who ' s the most important person , " Mr. Peterson asked , tapping Joe on the knee . " Mom , " Joe answered . " You ' ve got to believe in yourself in order to be important to anyone else , " Mr. Peterson said to Joe . " You and I have been rowing in the same boat. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
