THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FOR almost fifty years , this magazine has occupied offices in a building whose lobby serves as an arcade connecting West Forty-third Street and West Forty-fourth Street . The building was put up in the nineteen-twenties by James T. Lee , a prominent lawyer and real-estate developer of the day ( later to become a grandfather of Jacqueline Onassis ) . Mr. Lee took great pride in his buildings . In the case of No. 25 , he commissioned Starrett &; Van Vleck , a leading architectural firm , to draw up the plans ; it provided a red brick exterior vaguely Georgian in style and a lobby with classical barrel vaulting and an appropriate amplitude of marble and travertine . Until a few years ago , a painting of Mr. Lee was to be seen in the lunette above the Forty-third Street entrance ; it depicted him scrutinizing the plans for the building as they lay unfurled on his desk , much as Julius II might have scrutinized Michelangelo 's plans for the improvement of the Sistine Chapel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unassuming dignity , in part because it is a street dominated by clubs , hotels , and institutions , most of them dating hack at least to the turn of the century . In the block between Fifth and Sixth Avenues stand the mansard-roofed Mansfield Hotel , an architectural echo of la belle epaque ; the General Society of Mechanics &; Tradesmen , bearing a frieze borrowed , on a much reduced scale , from the Parthenon ; the Har yard Club ; Touro College , which was built as the Yale Club ; the New York Yacht Club ; the Royalton Hotel ; the Algonquin Hotel ; and the august limestone-and-granite pile that houses the Association of the Bar of the City of New York . In the block west of Sixth Avenue we find the Belasco Theatre ; the 123 Building , formerly the high-and-mighty Hotel Langwell ; the Manhattan Church of the Nazarene , formerly the Lambs Club , designed by Stanford White ; the Hudson Theatre ; and a small cluster of once fashionable buildings , a couple of which have recently been occupied by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play on nearby Broadway , " S.R.O . " would mean " standing room only , " but in this instance the initials mean " single-room occupancy " ? a convenient euphemism for hotels that are often used as shelters for people homeless and on welfare . Quiet and unassuming West Forty-fourth Street ? Yes , but we live , as we all know , in an age of ever-increasing vandalism , and just over two weeks ago a violent act of vandalism was perpetrated on West Forty-fourth Street , placing in jeopardy the lives of hundreds of people in the neighborhood . Around six in the evening , in the midwinter dark , at an hour when no demolition of property may ordinarily be carried out in the city , a big crane and a wrecking crew moved into the street and started knocking down four buildings , including two untenanted S.R.O . hotels . The crew had never been issued a demolition permit , nor had it troubled to arrange for the gas and water lines to be turned off . The crane smashed through the outer walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the street . If a spark had happened to ignite the gas in the lines , a fearful explosion could have taken place . Soon a neighbor , in understandable panic , telephoned the police , and a squad car arrived in time to prevent a major catastrophe . The street , already filled with rubble , and therefore impassable , was officially sealed off . Now , what was going on here ? This was obviously a perhaps unprecedented act of large-scale vandalism , or even terrorism , but it was n't ideological in nature , as it might have been in the Middle East or in Northern Ireland . On the contrary , it was vandalism based on nothing more complicated than greed  --  the greed of somebody so eager to make a financial killing that he appears to have ignored the possibility that the actual killing of human beings might be involved . According to what has emerged in the press so far , a developer had been assembling a large parcel of land in the area , including the four buildings that the wrecking crew went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Council was set to consider a measure declaring an eighteen-month-long moratorium on the demolition or conversion of S.R.O . hotels . As it was proposed , the measure would be retroactive to a date that would make it impossible for two of the four buildings to he torn down ; if the buildings remained , the developer would fail in his intention to erect a vast high-rise structure on the site . Hence " I L suspect we re being the wrecking crew . Hence the exposed gas and water lines . Hence the rubble in the street , falling among passersby . The city has filed a ten-million-dollar suit against whoever may turn ant to be responsible for the crime . At the moment , no one seems to know who is responsible . The apparent owner named in the city 's complaint has denied any responsibility for the demolition . The demolition company named has declined to comment . To cover the perplexity , the city 's complaint also refers to " John Doe " and " Jane Doe . " If so wanton an act could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Times Square , how readily it could be carried out anywhere in the five ? ? boroughs ! It is plain that the party or parties eventually found guilty must be punished by more than the mere payment of fines . Meanwhile , our old , beloved Forty-fourth Street is n't , and wo n't be , quite what it was . Boats OUR friend the out-of-town sailor breezed through Manhattan for his annual look at the National Boat Show ( recently at the Coliseum ) and dropped off the following report : This was the seventy-fifth New York Boat Show since the series began , in 1905 , and the show 's management took the dangerous step of marking the occasion with a small display JANUARY 28,1985 of antique motorboats and marine equipment  --  dangerous because some of the early boats on view have the kind of warm , come-hither glow to them which seems to be the exclusive property of varnished wood , a substance as rare as diamonds aboard most modern pleasure craft . The first boat visible  --  it was in the Coliseum 's lobby  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slender runabout sporting a scallop-edged fabric awning . She certainly carries her years gracefully : according to a press release , she was exhibited in the first New York show , at which time she was alit ready three years old . Several thousand naphtha launches were built , but , partly because of the volatility of the fuel , a close relative of cleaning fluid , only half a dozen survive today . The other old-time boats were tucked away on a sort of mezzanine annex of the Coliseum 's ground floor , and chief among them was a handsome 1931 Chris-Craft speedboat , the property of Mr. G. Dale Murray , who is the chairman of the board of Murray Chris-Craft  --  one of a very few marine firms to have bridged the eighty-year chasm from the first show to this one . Another fascinating part of the antique exhibit consisted of outboard motors , mostly from the early years of the century  --  no-nonsense , solid-looking contrivances that were among the most fragile and temperamental pieces of machinery ever fabricated by man . Out on the floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster powerboats and ever more elaborate electronic devices seemed to press on unabated . At least one boat on display , the Hustler 32 Limited Edition , has recorded speeds of over a hundred miles an hour ; the prospect of a number of such conveyances loose on the waterways may give one pause  --  especially since no license of any kind is required for driving THE NEW YORKER. them . The Hustler comes equipped with mirrors on the cabin overhead and a bar , so one may conclude that serious racers are not the only customers the builder has in mind . Among the electronic navigation devices at the show , some of the most arresting were the new depth recorders , which paint a cross-section of the sea bottom , often in several shades , on a constantly unrolling paper scroll . The result , given properly craggy topography , can be weirdly beautiful  --  and useful , too , presumably . The talking instruments that were the epitome of progress a couple of years ago seem to have largely vanished , however . I remember a depth sounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , when it reached the end of its scale , and I remember thinking what an unpleasant shipmate it would make . Perhaps other people thought so , too . Somewhere in every boat show is at least one craft designed  --  according to its builder  --  to do everything . This year , it was the Saroca , a sixteen-anda-half-foot vessel that called to mind a modernistic canoe well along in pregnancy : very narrow at the ends but with a marked bulge just aft of amidships . Two small cockpits at bow and stern could accommodate paddlers , while a much larger one , occupying most of the middle of the boat , could take an oarsman 's fixed or sliding seat , or a couple of sleeping bags flanking a dagger-board trunk , sort of like a hollow bundling board . With its several options , the boat is supposed to be suited for sailing , rowing , and canoeing ( hence " Saroca " ) , and for fishing , hunting , and camping . One may also attach a small outboard motor ( an addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ousaroca " ) . Unlike many such combinative efforts , the Saroca looked as if , in the hands of a reasonably skilled operator , it might do most , if not quite all , the things claimed for it . Philosophically opposed to the protean Saroca is the serious rowing boat , which seems to be enjoying a small revival : three purveyors of these craft were exhibiting their wares side by side at the show . The vessels obviously derive from the one-man and two-man shells of competitive rowing , but the varnished brightwork hulls of a generation ago have inevitably given way to fibre glass . The spoon-bladed wooden oars look the same as they used to , though  --  better , in some cases  --  and they help make up for the hulls ' rather antiseptic appearance . The boats themselves are somewhat more seaworthy than their ancestors were , mostly because of flotation material , but their outrigger rowlocks , their sliding seats , and their extremely narrow beam combine to keep them firmly in the class of single-purpose small craft . Though the mariners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual sense of that term , there is surely a spiritual similarity between the sailor who races to Bermuda and , say , the lone rowers who regularly take their Alden Singles ( sixteen feet by twenty-five inches ) from the New Hampshire shore to the Isles of Shoals , six miles out in the North Atlantic ; or Rob Jackson and John Aaranson , who have raced their Small Craft Double ( twenty-four feet by thirty inches ) thirty-six statute miles from Catalina Island , off the California coast , to llarina del Rey , on the mainland , at an average speed of nearly seven miles per hour . To someone like me , whose normal idyll afloat is that of Kenneth Grahame 's Water Rat ? " simply messing about in boats " ? this sort of single-minded endeavor is unappealing , but the purposeful elegance of the rowing boats on view set my adrenaline pumping so vigorously that several large tots of grog were indicated , not to slow the pulse so much as to paralyze the check-writing hand . In the end , only the grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and for many glassy-eyed visitors , stumbling into the dusk with their sackfuls of bright-colored literature , it was obviously too late . Halley 's Comet AN astrophysicist friend writes : Beginning with the blast-off of two Soviet rockets , last month , a total of five spacecraft are being launched from the planet Earth to rendezvous with Halley 's Comet . The comet makes its once-in-a-lifetime visit to the solar neighborhood about every seventy-six years , and , this trip , it will be nearest the sun on February 9 , 1986 . The spacecraft will come up with it about a month later . Until now , astronomers have had to settle for earthbound views of Halley 's and the thousand-odd other comets recorded over the centuries . Cornets , throughout history , have stirred up all sorts of speculations and fancies : views of comets as pieces of planets , as orbiting hailstorms , as dirty snowballs ; views of comets as omens of defeat in battle or of the untimely demise of an emperor ; views of comets as carriers of flu , as sowers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that signalled the Norman invasion , that served as the Star of Bethlehem , that brought on the bubonic plague , that blackened the sky and killed off the dinosaurs ; comparisons of a comet 's head to the eye of an ox and its tail to the far ) of a peacock ; drawings of angry comets splitting the earth while the moon looks on merrily ; sweepstakes on guessing the date of a comet 's arrival . Fitted out with various scientific instruments , the five spacecraft  --  the two from Russia ( both of which contain United States contributions ) , two from Japan , and one from a consortium of countries in Europe  --  are expected to find out at close range exactly what a comet is and does , and to radio their data back to Earth , ninety-one million miles away . Halley 's Comet is special in several respects . Its orbit , which reaches past Neptune at the farthest point , is still sufficiently small to have been well charted , but its flashy display is more like that of " younger " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Halley 's is the first comet whose periodic sightings were reckoned to be returns of the same object . Taking the credit for this idea was Edmond Halley , scientist extraordinaire and general snooper : an Englishman who measured the areas of counties by cutting up the map and weighing the pieces , and who figured out a scheme for the first life-insurance tables ; a man who persuaded his colleague Isaac Newton to finish the " Principia " and dogged him into inserting an exhausting section on comets in its second edition . For thousands of years before Halley 's work , people believed that every comet streaking through the solar system was on a one-way trip . When Halley took up comets , his friend Newton , having just discovered the law of gravity , explained to him that comets , like all bodies orbiting the sun , ought to have trajectories in one of four shapes : hyperbola , parabola , circle , or ellipse . The first two do n't turn around and close on themselves ; the last two do . Halley looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1607 , and 1682 ( this one seen by him at age twenty-six ) were the same object , orbiting the sun in an elongated ellipse . Halley 's triumph , which he was not around to enjoy , was the dutiful return of his cornet in December of 1758 , as he had predicted . Last time through , in 1910 , Halley was three days behind schedule . This could n't be explained just on the basis of a planetlike orbit about the sun , and gave rise to the prevailing " dirty snowball " theory of comets . According to this theory , deep inside a comet 's head is a solid nucleus , a few miles in diameter , that is made of ice , dust , and minerals . As a comet nears the sun , the ice and dust on its sunny side evaporate and stream off , nudging the comet in the opposite direction . This additional rocketlike force on a cornet can account for its off-cue behavior . These same vapors boiled out of the tiny nucleus create the comet 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flimsy wisp for many millions of miles . Zipping through the solar system as it does , with a body larger than the sun 's and a total mass far smaller than the moon 's , a comet has more style than substance . No one knows for sure how big the central snowball is , or even whether there is one , but the cameras on the spacecraft should find out . The thing that many scientists will be waiting for is news of precisely what 's inside a comet 's nucleus . If comets condensed out of the same embryonic gas and dust as our solar system did , they will still contain those ingredients in their original form . Planets and moons , heated by the sun and squeezed by their own weight , have melted and congealed , and so blurred the record of their birth , but comets spend most of their time far from the sun and have little weight to support . Comets , therefore , could shed light on the origin of the solar system . As I , like others , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Comet , what strikes me is the mission 's lack of practical value . At a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars , the world will not learn new methods for producing plastics , will not get hack better silicon computer chips grown in space or new communication networks . The countries involved are not likely to boost their national prestige nearly so much as we and the Russians did in the frantic post-Sputnik race to space . And comets are poor places to put military bases . All we 'll get is a better hold on this strange universe we find ourselves in  --  like my four-year-old daughter , who knows nothing of plastics or politics but who asks questions about the world ( " Why , is the sky up and not down ? " " Where does the rain come from ? " ) and is comforted and delighted by the answers . Up Front GO out in the driveway and lift the bonnet on the Rolls . Either one , the Corniche or the Silver Shadow  --  it does n't matter . Now look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters stamped in the steel . If it says " TT , " your grille was personally assembled over the course of an entire day by Tony Kent , one of ten workmen in the Rolls grille shop at Crewe , in Cheshire , and a fan of American football , which comes on the telly Sunday nights . " I used to think it was a sissy game , because they all wore pads everywhere , " Mr. Kent ( " Tony , really " ) said , in a broad North Country accent . " What I 've decided is , the guy who has the best job is the one " Oh , everything is just fine . Yes , Pm still with Edward . " who runs on the field every so often and kicks the ball . They can make two hundred thousand dollars , I hear . And most of them are English .

" One look inside , and he would tell us who had made the grille . " DD ' ? that 's Dennis Jones , " he said after inspecting a Silver Shadow . " He 's been there a bit longer than me . It 's a small department where I work , and there 's no aggro  --  that means aggravation  --  at all . Everyone thinks they do the best job , naturally , but you ca n't tell one from another unless you look inside . Here 's a ' MP  --  that 's a lad named Derek .

Though all the surfaces look flat , they are actually bowed several degrees . " It 's called entasis  --  it goes back to when they built the Parthenon , " Tony said . " It 's curved , so it looks flat . If it was flat , it 'd look curved . " He showed us his soldering iron , his rasps and files , and the six-inch steel rule he 's used since he was a fifteen-year-old apprentice ; he was carrying his tools in a New York Hilton laundry bag . " This trip to America is like a dream , " he said . " Of the ten of us , six put our names in the hat to go , and the foreman drew me . The others are n't jealous , so long as I bring them something back . Sometimes it 's been quite embarrassing . I was at an auto show in California showing how I solder a grille .
