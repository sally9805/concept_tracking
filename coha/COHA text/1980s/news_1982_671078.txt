There are at least five , and possibly six , major forces influencing the negotiations over who will lead the country ' s efforts to pull itself out of civil war and into some semblance of economic recovery. // They are the Christian Democrats ; their rightist opponents , who may make up two factions rather than a solid front ; the Salvadoran armed forces ; the leftist rebels , and the United States . <> <> Centrists ' Situation Tenuous // In a nation where fradulent elections , personal deal-making and military coups have been the traditional means of installing and removing governments , nearly every action involving democratic principles and political compromise is an experiment. // The Christian Democrats are in a tenuous situation . Although they won a plurality of the popular vote cast in last month ' s elections for a Constituent Assembly and 24 of the 60 seats , they have been forced into a minority role by a coalition of the right. // This has caused deep consternation not only among officials of the United States , but also in the Salvadoran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support in Congress and among the American people for a military solution to El Salvador ' s leftist insurgency , had accepted the idea that a redistribution of wealth is critical in gaining the Salvadoran people ' s backing in the struggle against the left . <> <> Rightists Disturb the U.S. // They were therefore distressed when the Christian Democrats , the party most likely to continue that type of change , failed to garner a majority in last month ' s voting for the Constituent Assembly , which will elect a President and schedule election. // And they were even more disturbed by the coalition among the rightwing parties , some of whose candidates ran on a platform of dismantling the changes already enacted and others of whom have been closely tied to the random violence and killings that are euphemistically referred to as human rights violations. // A Government controlled by these factions , Administration officials fear , would be unable to retain the Congressional support necessary to obtain further military and economic aid , giving the leftist rebels an additional advantage. // That message has been impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the military - which was unencumbered by direct involvement in the immediate battle for political power - grasped it more quickly. // When the military realized last week that the politicians ' power struggle could undercut its own interests , it stepped in , virtually ordering the politicians - particularly those on the right - to come to terms on a moderate President to give the Government at least an appearance of balance . It was , said a leading rightist politician , " an elegant coup. " // For while the military is conservative , the rightists of the Nationalist Republican Alliance headed by Roberto d ' Aubusson ' s are decidedly more so , and there is considerable personal animosity between officials of the two sides . There is , as well , a constituency of junior military officers with relatively progressive views , and military leaders know they must satisfy them as well. // No one is saying publicly what will happen if the military does not get what it wants , or if the power of a moderate President , if one is indeed elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly . In putting together the Assembly ' s charter last night , the rightists showed some restraint in assigning themselves power , but not nearly as much as the Christian Democrats had wanted. // There have been many rumors of a possible military coup in recent days , leading the politicians to be extremely cautious in their public reactions. // Among them , Mr. d ' Aubuisson , who has been chosen head of the Assembly , has been the least guarded , at least toward the military . For the moment , it appears he is betting that the United States has too much invested in its promotion of democracy here to allow it to be shattered by a military coup . His blistering attack Monday on Jaime Abdul Gutierrez , a top military leader and member of the ruling junta , for exerting pressure on the parties ' presidential deliberations was an indication of that. // At the same time , Mr. d ' Aubuisson has been extremely careful of late in his statements about the United States . But several officials - Salvadoran and foreign - believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial element of " shoot the messenger " and was as much a condemnation of American intervention as of military pressure. // One clue to El Salvador ' s future will come with the selection of a President . The United States , as well as the military , are hoping that the rightist coalition will split , at least on this issue , and that the conservative National Conciliation Party - which worked with the military in its two decades of power - will join the Christian Democrats in selecting a moderate for the post. // A remaining mystery , however , is the power of the left . The guerrillas have recently been conducting only sporadic battles in the countryside and have been relatively inactive in San Salvador , but that could change quickly and dramatically . Rebel radio stations have been telling the public to prepare for a major offensive beginning this weekend . And Christian Democratic leaders are warning that if they are excluded from the legitimate centers of democratic power , support of the left by the political center could substantially increase. //     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
