South Korean Opposition Leader Kim Dae Jung won about 45% of the vote for President in 1971 , and ranks as a leading contender in elections to choose a successor to President Chun Doo Hwan , whose term expires in 1988 . Last week Kim offered to jettison his longtime dream of occupying Seoul 's Blue House , provided that the ruling Democratic Justice Party agreed to permit the direct election of the next President . Said Kim : " If I do n't stand for the presidency in 1988 , the government has no excuse to oppose direct elections . " <P> Chun has agreed to revise the present indirect system of selecting the chief executive , but remains stubbornly opposed to fully democratic elections , which his military-dominated party would probably lose . Instead , he favors a parliamentary system , in which a Prime Minister would be selected on the basis of seats held in the National Assembly . Kim charges that any such election could be rigged in advance to split the opposition and assure the autocratic Chun 's continued rule .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
