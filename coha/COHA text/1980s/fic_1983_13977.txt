MAY ( crossing down to head of bed ) What do you think it 's like sittin ' in a tin trailer for weeks on end with the wind ripping through it ? Waitin ' around for the butane to arrive .

He takes a few steps toward her . Stops . They both move closer . Stop . Pause as they look at each other . They embrace . Long , tender kiss . They are very soft with each other . She pulls away from him slightly . Smiles . She looks him straight in the eyes , then suddenly knees him in the groin with tremendous force . EDDIE doubles over and drops like a rock . She stands over him . Pause . ) MAY You can take it , right . You 're a stunt man . ( She exits into bathroom , stage right , slams the door behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden in the frame so that each time an actor slams it , the door booms loud and long . Same is true for the stage-left door . EDDIE remains on the floor holding his stomach in pain . Stage lights drop to half their intensity as a spot rises softly on THE OLD MAN . He speaks directly to EDDIE. ) p. 12 THE OLD MAN I thought you were supposed to be a fantasist , right ? Is n't that basically the deal with you ? You dream things up . Is n't that true ? EDDIE ( stays on floor ) I do n't know . THE OLD MAN You do n't know . Well , if you do n't know I do n't know who the hell else does . I wan na ' show you somethin ' . Somethin ' real , okay ? Somethin ' actual . EDDIE Sure . THE OLD MAN Take a look at that picture on the wall over there . ( he points at wall stage-right . There is no picture but EDDIE stares at the wall . ) Ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ya ' see it ? EDDIE ( staring at wall ) Yeah . THE OLD MAN Ya ' know who that is ? EDDIE I 'm not sure . THE OLD MAN Barbara Mandrell . That 's who that is . Barbara Mandrell . You heard a ' her ? EDDIE Sure . THE OLD MAN Well , would you believe me if I told ya ' I was married to her ? EDDIE ( pause ) No . THE OLD MAN Well , see , now that 's the difference right there . That 's realism . I am actually married to Barbara Mandrell in my mind . Can you understand that ? p. 13 EDDIE Sure . THE OLD MAN Good . I 'm glad we have an understanding . ( THE OLD MAN drinks from his cup . Spot slowly fades to black as stage lights come back up full . These light changes are cued to the opening and closing of doors . MAY enters from bathroom , closes door quietly . She is carrying a sleek red dress , panty hose , a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairbrush . She crosses to foot of bed and throws the clothes on it . Hangs the purse on a bedpost , sits on foot of bed her back to EDDIE and starts brushing her hair . EDDIE remains on floor . She finishes brushing her hair , throws brush on bed , then starts taking off her clothes and changing into the clothes she brought onstage . As she speaks to EDDIE and changes into the new clothes , she gradually transforms from her former tough drabness into a very sexy woman . This occurs almost unnoticeably in the course of her speech . ) MAY ( very cold , quick , almost monotone voice like she 's writing him a letter ) I do n't understand my feelings . I really do n't . I do n't understand how I could hate you so much after so much time . How , no matter how much I 'd like to not hate you , I hate you even more . It grows . I ca n't even see you now . All I see is a picture of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the picture 's real anymore . I do n't even care . It 's a made-up picture . It invades my head . The two of you . And this picture stings even more than if I 'd actually seen you with her . It cuts me . It cuts me so deep I 'll never get over it . And I ca n't get rid of this picture either . It just comes . Uninvited . Kinda ' like a little torture . And I blame you more for this little torture than I do for what you did . p. 14 EDDIE ( standing slowly ) I 'll go . MAY You better . EDDIE Why ? MAY You just better . EDDIE I thought you wanted me to stay . MAY I got somebody coming to get me . EDDIE ( short pause , on his feet ) Here ? MAY Yeah , here . Where else ? EDDIE ( makes a move toward her upstage ) You been seeing somebody ? MAY ( she moves quickly down left , crosses right ) When was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember that far back ? EDDIE Who 've you been seeing ? ( He moves violently toward her . ) MAY Do n't you touch me ! Do n't you even think about it . EDDIE How long have you been seeing him ! MAY What difference does it make ! ( Short pause . He stares at her , then turns suddenly and exits out the stage-left door and slams it behind him . Door booms. ) p. 15 MAY Eddie ! Where are you going ? Eddie ! ( Short pause . She looks after EDDIE , then turns fast , moves upstage to window . She parts the Venetian blinds , looks out window , turns back into room . She rushes to upstage side of bed , gets down on hands and knees , pulls a suitcase out from under bed , throws it on top of bed , opens it . She rushes into bathroom , disappears , leaving door open . She comes back on with various items of clothing , throws stuff into suitcase , turns as if to go back into bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly shuts suitcase , slides it under bed again , rushes around to down-stage side of bed . Sits on bed . Stands again . Rushes back into bathroom , returns with hairbrush , slams bathroom door . Starts brushing her hair as though that 's what she 's been doing all along . She sits on bed brushing her hair . EDDIE enters stage left , slams door behind him , door booms . He stands there holding a ten gauge shotgun in one hand and a bottle of tequila in the other . He moves toward bed , tosses shotgun on bed beside her . ) MAY ( she stands , moves upstage , stops brushing her hair ) Oh , wonderful . What 're you gon na ' do with that ? EDDIE Clean it . ( He opens the bottle . ) EDDIE You got any glasses ? p. 16 MAY In the bathroom . EDDIE What 're they doin ' in the bathroom ?

MAY moves back to bed , stares at shotgun . ) MAY Eddie , this is a very friendly person who 's coming over here . He 's not malicious in any way . ( pause ) Eddie ? EDDIE 'S VOICE ( off right ) Where 's the damn glasses ? MAY In the medicine cabinet ! EDDIE 'S VOICE What the hell 're they doin ' in the medicine cabinet ! ( Sound of medicine cabinet being opened and slammed shut off right . ) MAY There 's no germs in the medicine cabinet ! EDDIE 'S VOICE Germs . MAY Eddie , did you hear me ? ( EDDIE enters with a glass , pouring tequila into it slowly until it 's full as he crosses to table down left. ) p. 17 MAY Did you hear what I said , Eddie ? EDDIE About what ? MAY About the man who 's coming over here . EDDIE What man ? MAY Oh , brother . ( EDDIE sets bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takes a long drink from glass . He ignores THE OLD MAN . ) EDDIE First off , it ca n't be very serious . MAY Oh , really ? And why is that ? EDDIE Because you call him a " man . " MAY What am I supposed to call him ? EDDIE A " guy " or something . If you called him a " guy , " I 'd be worried about it but since you call him a " man " you give yourself away . You 're in a dumb situation with this guy by calling him a " man . " You put yourself below him . MAY What in the hell do you know about it . EDDIE This guy 's got ta ' be a twerp . He 's got ta ' be a punk chump in a two dollar suit or somethin ' . MAY Anybody who does n't half kill themselves falling off horses or jumping on steers is a twerp in your book . EDDIE That 's right . p. 18 MAY And what 're you supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( EDDIE lowers his glass slowly . Stares at her . Pause . He smiles then speaks low and deliberately . ) EDDIE I 'll tell you what . We 'll just wait for this " man " to come over here . The two of us . We 'll just set right here and wait . Then I 'll let you be the judge . MAY Why is everything a big contest with you ? He 's not competing with you . He does n't even know you exist . EDDIE You can introduce me . MAY I 'm not introducing you . I am definitely not introducing you . He 'd be very embarrassed to find me here with somebody else . Besides , I 've only just met him . EDDIE Embarrassed ? MAY Yes ! Embarrassed . He 's a very gentle person . EDDIE Is that right . Well , I 'm a very gentle person myself . My feelings get easily damaged . MAY What feelings . ( EDDIE falls silent , takes a drink , then gets up slowly with glass , leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , sets glass on floor , picks up shotgun and starts dismantling it . MAY watches him closely . ) MAY You ca n't keep messing me around like this . It 's been going on too long . I ca n't take it anymore . I get sick everytime you come around . Then I get sick when you leave . You 're like a disease to me . Besides , you got no right being jealous of me after all the bullshit I 've been through with you . ( Pause . EDDIE keeps his attention on shotgun as he talks to her. ) p. 19 EDDIE We 've got a pact . MAY Oh , God . EDDIE We made a pact . MAY There 's nothing between us now ! EDDIE Then what 're you so excited about ? MAY I 'm not excited . EDDIE You 're beside yourself . MAY You 're driving me crazy . You 're driving me totally crazy ! EDDIE You know we 're connected , May . We 'll always be connected . That was decided a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that up . EDDIE You know what happened . MAY You promised me that was finished . You ca n't start that up all over again . You promised me . EDDIE A promise ca n't stop something like that . It happened . MAY Nothing happened ! Nothing ever happened ! EDDIE Innocent to the last drop . MAY ( pause , controlled ) Eddie  --  will you please leave ? Now . EDDIE You 're gon na ' find out one way or the other . p. 20 MAY I want you to leave . EDDIE You did n't want me to leave before . MAY I want you to leave now . And it 's not because of this man . It 's just  --  EDDIE What . MAY Stupid . You ought a ' know that by now . EDDIE You think so , huh ? MAY It 'll be the same thing over and over again . We 'll be together for a little while and then you 'll be gone . EDDIE I 'll be gone . MAY You will . You know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . As soon as that 's over , you 'll be gone again . EDDIE I did n't come here because you were seein ' somebody else ! I do n't give a damn who you 're seeing ! You 'll never replace me and you know it ! MAY Get outa ' here ! ( Long silence . EDDIE lifts his glass and toasts her , then slowly drinks it dry . He sets glass down softly on floor . ) EDDIE ( smiles at her ) All right . ( He rises slowly , picks up the sections of his shotgun . He stands there looking down at the shotgun pieces for a second . MAY moves slightly toward him. ) p. 21 MAY Eddie  --  ( His head jerks up and stares at her . She stops cold . ) EDDIE You 're a traitor . ( He exits left with shotgun . Slams door . Door booms . MAY runs toward door . ) MAY Eddie ! ! ( She throws herself against stage-left door . Her arms reach out and hug the walls . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstage to the corner , embracing the wall as she moves and weeps . THE OLD MAN begins to tell his story as MAY moves slowly along the wall . He tells it directly to her as though she 's a child . MAY remains involved with her emotion of loss and keeps moving clear around the room , hugging the walls during the course of the story until she arrives in the extreme downstage-right corner of the room . She sinks to her knees . ) ( Slowly , in the course of MAY 'S mourning , the spotlight softly rises on THE OLD MAN and the stage lights decrease to half again . ) THE OLD MAN Ya ' know , one thing I 'll never forget . I 'll never forget this as long as I live  --  and I do n't even know why I remember it exactly . We were drivin ' through southern Utah once , I think it was . Me , you and your mother  --  in that old Plymouth we had . You remember that Plymouth ? Had a white plastic hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . Some kind a ' ship . Anyway , we 'd been drivin ' all night and you were sound asleep in the front . And all of a sudden you woke up crying . Just bustin ' a gut over somethin ' . I do n't know what it was . Nightmare or somethin ' . Woke your mom right up and she climbed over the seat in back there with you to try to get you settled down . But you would n't shut up for hell or high water . Just kept wailing away . So I stopped the Plymouth by the side of the road . Middle a ' nowhere . I ca n't even remember where it was exactly . Pitch black . I picked you up outa ' the back seat there and carried you into this field . Thought the cold air might quiet you down a little bit . But you just kept on howling away . Then , all of a sudden , I saw somethin ' move out there . Somethin ' bigger than both of us put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . ( MAY begins to crawl slowly on her hands and knees from down-right corner toward bed . When she reaches bed , she grabs pillow and embraces it , still on her knees . She rocks back and forth embracing pillow as THE OLD MAN continues . ) And then it started to get joined up by some other things just like it . Same shape and everything . It was so black out there I could hardly make out my own hand . But these things started to kinda ' move in on us from all directions in a big circle . And I stopped dead still and turned back to the car to see if your mother was all right . But I could n't see the car anymore . So I called out to her . I called her name loud and clear . And she answered me back from outa ' the darkness . She yelled back to me . And just then these things scarted to " moo . " They all started " mooing " away . ( He makes the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were , standin ' smack in the middle of a goddamn herd of cattle . Well , you never heard a baby pipe down so fast in your life . You never made a peep after that . The whole rest of the trip . ( MAY stops rocking abruptly . Suddenly MAY hears EDDIE off left . Stage lights pop back up . Spot on THE OLD MAN cuts to black . She leaps to her feet , completely dropping her grief , hesitates a second , then rushes to chair upstage of table and sits . She takes a drink straight from the bottle , slams bottle down on table , leans back in the chair and stares at the bottle as though she 's been sitting like that the whole time since he left . EDDIE enters fast from stage-left door carrying two steer ropes . He slams door . Door booms . He completely ignores MAY . She completely ignores him and keeps staring at the bottle . He crosses upstage of bed , throws one of the ropes on bed and starts building a loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand so that it makes a snakelike zipping sound as it passes through the honda . Now he begins to pay attention to MAY as he continues fooling with the rope . She remains staring at the bottle of tequila. ) p. 22 EDDIE Decided to jump off the wagon , huh ? ( He spins the rope above his head in a flat horn-loop , then ropes one of the bedposts , taking up the slack with a sharp snap of the right hand . He takes the loop off the bedpost , rebuilds it , swings and ropes another bedpost . He continues this right around the bed , roping every post and never missing . MAY takes another drink and sets bottle down quietly . ) MAY ( still not looking at him ) What 're you doing ? EDDIE Little practice . Got ta ' stay in practice these days . There 's kids out there ropin ' calves in six seconds dead . Can you believe that ? Six and no change . Flyin ' off the saddle on the right hand side like a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , they got it down to a science . ( He continues roping bedposts , making his way around the bed in a circle . ) MAY ( flatly , staring at bottle ) I thought you were leaving . Did n't you say you were leaving ? EDDIE ( as he ropes ) Well , yeah , I was gon na ' . But then it suddenly occurred to me in the middle of the parking lot out there that there probably is n't any man comin ' over here at all . There probably is n't any " guy " or any " man " or anybody comin ' over here . You just made all that up . p. 23 MAY Why would I do that ? EDDIE Just to get even . ( She turns to him slowly in chair , takes a drink , stares at him , then sets bottle on table . ) MAY I 'll never get even with you . ( He laughs , crosses to table , takes a deep drink from bottle , cocks his head back , gargles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashes into stage-right wall . ) MAY So , now we 're gon na ' get real mean and sloppy , is that it ? Just like old times . EDDIE Well , I have n't dropped the reins in quite a while ya ' know . I 've been real good . I have . No hooch . No slammer . No women . No nothin ' . I been a pretty boring kind of a guy actually . I figure I owe it to myself . Once a once . ( He returns to roping the bedposts . She just stares at him from the chair . ) MAY Why are you doing this ? EDDIE I already told ya ' . I need the practice . MAY I do n't mean that . EDDIE Well , say what ya ' mean then , honey . MAY Why are you going through this whole thing again like you 're trying to impress me or something . Like we just met . This is the same crap you laid on me in high school . p. 24 EDDIE ( still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my love , see , baby . I mean if I stopped trying to impress you , that 'd mean it was all over , would n't it ? MAY It is all over . EDDIE You 're trying to impress me , too , are n't you ? MAY You know me inside and out . I got nothing new to show you . EDDIE You got this guy comin ' over . This new guy . That 's very impressive . I woulda ' thought you 'd be hung out to dry by now . MAY Oh , thanks a lot . EDDIE What is he , a " younger man " or something ? MAY It 's none of your damn business . EDDIE Have you balled him yet ? ( She throws him a mean glare and just pins him with her eyes . ) EDDIE Have you ? I 'm just curious . ( pause ) You do n't have to tell me . I already know . MAY You 're just like a little kid , you know that ? A jealous little snot-nosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snot-nosed-kid face , keeps roping bedposts. ) p. 25 EDDIE I hope this guy comes over . I really hope he does . I wan na ' see him walk through that door . MAY What 're you gon na ' do ? ( He stops roping , turns to her . He smiles . ) EDDIE I 'm gon na ' nail his ass to the floor . Directly . ( He suddenly ropes chair downstage , right next to MAY . He takes up slack and drags chair violently back toward bed . Pause . They stare at each other . MAY suddenly stands , goes to bedpost , grabs her purse , slings it on her shoulder and heads for stage-left door . ) MAY I 'm not sticking around for this . ( She exits stage-left door , leaving it open . EDDIE runs offstage after her . ) EDDIE Where 're you goin ' ? MAY ( off left ) Take your hands offa ' me ! EDDIE ( off left ) Wait a second , wait a second . Just a second , okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kicking . He sets her down , slams door shut . She walks away from him stage right , straightening her dress . ) EDDIE Tell ya ' what . I 'll back off . I 'll be real nice . I will . I promise . I 'll be just like a little ole pussycat , okay ? You can introduce me to him as your brother or something . Well  --  maybe not your brother . p. 26 MAY Maybe not . EDDIE Your cousin . Okay ? I 'll be your cousin . I just wan na ' meet him is all . Then I 'll leave . Promise . MAY Why do you want to meet him ? He 's just a friend . EDDIE Just to see where you stand these days . You can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep . MAY Look . I 'm going outside . I 'm going to the pay phone across the street . I 'm calling him up and I 'm telling him to forget about the whole thing . Okay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're gone . MAY I 'm not going with you , Eddie ! ( Suddenly headlights arc across the stage from upstage right , through the window . They slash across the audience , then dissolve off left . These should be two intense beams of piercing white light and not " realistic " headlights . ) MAY Oh , great . ( She rushes upstage to window , looks out . EDDIE laughs , takes a drink . ) EDDIE Why do n't ya ' run out there . Go ahead . Run on out . Throw yourself into his arms or somethin ' . Blow kisses in the moonlight . ( EDDIE laughs , moves to bed , pulls a pair of old spurs off his belt . Sits . Starts putting spurs on his boots . It 's important these spurs look old and used , with small rowels  --  not cartoon " cowboy " spurs . MAY goes into bathroom , leaving door open. ) p. 27 MAY ( off right ) What 're you doing ?

MAY ( entering from bathroom ) If you hurt him , Eddie  --  EDDIE I 'm not gon na ' hurt him . I 'm a nice guy . Very sensitive , too . Very civilized . MAY He 's just a date , you know . Just an ordinary date . EDDIE Yeah ? Well , I 'm gon na turn him into a fig . ( He starts laughing so hard at his own joke that he rolls off the bed and crashes to the floor . He goes into a fit of laughter , pounding his fists into the floor . MAY makes a move toward the door , then stops and turns to EDDIE . ) MAY Eddie ! Do me a favor . Just this once , okay ? EDDIE ( laughing hard ) Anything you want , honey . Anything you want . ( He goes on laughing hysterically . ) MAY ( turning away from him ) Shit . ( She goes to stage-left door and throws it open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stands in the doorway , staring out . Pause as EDDIE slowly gains control of himself and stops laughing . He stares at MAY. ) p. 28 EDDIE ( still on floor ) What 're you doing ? ( Pause . MAY keeps looking out ) May ? MAY ( staring out open door ) It 's not him . EDDIE It 's not , huh ? MAY No , it 's not . EDDIE Well , who is it then ? MAY Somebody else . EDDIE ( slowly getting up and sitting on bed ) Yeah . It 's probably not ever gon na ' be " him . " What 're you tryin ' to make me jealous for ? I know you 've been livin ' alone . MAY It 's a big , huge , extra-long , black Mercedes-Benz . EDDIE ( pause ) Well , this is a motel , is n't it ? People are allowed to park in front of a motel if they 're stayin ' here . MAY People who stay here do n't drive a big , huge , extra-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else might . MAY ( still at door ) This is not a black Mercedes-Benz type of motel . EDDIE Well , close the damn door then and get back inside . p. 29 MAY Somebody 's sitting out there in that car looking straight at me . EDDIE ( stands fast ) What 're they doing ? MAY It 's not a " they . " It 's a " she . " ( EDDIE drops to floor behind bed . ) EDDIE Well , what 's she doing , then ? MAY Just sitting there . Staring at me . EDDIE Get away from the door , May . MAY ( turning toward him slowly ) You do n't know anybody with a black Mercedes-Benz by any chance , do you ? EDDIE Get away from the door ! ( Suddenly the white headlight beams slash across the stage through the open door . EDDIE rushes to door , slams it shut and pushes MAY aside . Just as he slams the door the sound of a large caliber magnum pistol explodes off left , followed immediately by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blares and continues on one relentless note . ) MAY ( yelling over the sound of horn ) Who is that ! Who in the hell is that out there ! EDDIE How should I know . ( EDDIE flips the light switch off by stage-left door . Stage lights go black . Bathroom light stays on. ) p. 30 MAY Eddie ! EDDIE Just get down will ya ' ! Get down on the floor ! ( EDDIE grabs her and tries to pull her down on the floor beside the bed . MAY struggles in the dark with him . Car horn keeps blaring . Headlights start popping back and forth from high beam to low beam , slashing across stage through the window now . ) MAY Who is that ? Did you bring her with you ! You sonofabitch ! ( She starts lashing out at EDDIE , fighting with him as he tries to drag her down on the floor . ) EDDIE I did n't bring anybody with me ! I do n't know who she is ! I do n't know where she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya ' ! MAY She followed you here ! Did n't she ! You told her where you were going and she followed you . EDDIE I did n't tell anybody where I was going . I did n't know where I was going till I got here . MAY You are gon na ' pay for this ! I swear to God . You are gon na ' pay . ( EDDIE finally pulls her down and rolls over on top of her so she ca n't get up . She slowly gives up struggling as he keeps her pinned to the floor . Car horn suddenly stops . Headlights snap off . Long pause . They listen in the dark. ) p. 31 MAY What do you think she 's doing ? EDDIE How should I know . MAY Do n't pretend you do n't know her . That 's the kind of car a Countess drives . That 's the kind of car I always pictured her in. ( she starts struggling again ) EDDIE ( holding her down ) Just stay put . MAY I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of me and get shot by some dumb rich twat . Now lemme up , Eddie ! ( Sound of tires burning rubber off left . Headlights arc back across the stage again from left to right . A car drives off . Sound fades . ) EDDIE Just stay down ! MAY I 'm down ! ( Long pause in the dark . They listen . ) MAY How crazy is this chick anyway ? EDDIE She 's pretty crazy . MAY Have you balled her yet ? ( pause ) ( EDDIE gets up slowly , hunched over , crosses upstage to window cautiously , parts Venetian blinds and peeks outside . ) EDDIE ( looking out ) Shit , she 's blown the windshield outa ' my truck . Goddammit . p. 32 MAY ( still on floor ) Eddie ? EDDIE ( still looking out window ) What ? MAY Is she gone ? EDDIE I do n't know . I ca n't see any headlights . ( pause ) I do n't believe it . MAY ( gets up , crosses to light switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you got in her pants . ( She switches the light back on . EDDIE whirls around toward her . He stands . ) EDDIE ( moving toward her ) Turn the lights off ! Keep the lights off ! ( He rushes to light switch and turns lights back off . Stage goes back to darkness . MAY shoves past him and turns the lights back on again . Stage lit . ) MAY This is my place ! EDDIE Look , she 's gon na ' come back here . I know she 's gon na ' come back . We either have to get outa ' here now or you have to keep the fuckin ' lights off . MAY I thought you said you did n't know her ! EDDIE Get your stuff ! We 're gettin ' outa ' here . p. 33 MAY I 'm not leaving ! This is your mess , not mine . EDDIE I came here to get you ! Whatsa ' matter with you ! I came all this way to get you ! Do you think I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That bitch does n't mean anything to me ! Nuthin ' . I got no reason to be here but you . MAY I 'm not goin ' , Eddie . ( Pause . EDDIE stares at her . ) ( Spot rises on THE OLD MAN . Stage lights stay the same . EDDIE and MAY just stand there staring at each other through the duration of THE OLD MAN 'S words . They are not " frozen , " they just stand there and face each other in a suspended moment of recognition . ) THE OLD MAN Amazing thing is , neither one a ' you look a bit familiar to me . Ca n't figure that one out . I do n't recognize myself in either one a ' you . Never did . ' Course your mothers both put their stamp on ya ' . That 's plain to see . But my whole side a ' the issue is absent , in my opinion . Totally unrecognizable . You could be anybody 's . Probably are . I ca n't even remember the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' things I forgot . Good thing I got out when I did though . Best thing I ever did . ( Spot fades on THE OLD MAN . Stage lights come back up . EDDIE picks up his rope and starts to coil it up . MAY watches him. ) p. 34 EDDIE I 'm not leavin ' . I do n't care what you think anymore . I do n't care what you feel . None a ' that matters . I 'm not leavin ' . I 'm stayin ' right here . I do n't care if a hundred " dates " walk through that door  --  I 'll take every one of ' em on . I do n't care if you hate my guts . I do n't care if you ca n't stand the sight of me or the sound of me or the smell of me . I 'm never leavin ' . You 'll never get rid of me . You 'll never escape me either . I 'll track you down no matter where you go . I know exactly how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every single time . MAY You 've got ta ' give this up , Eddie . EDDIE I 'm not giving it up ! ( Pause . ) MAY ( calm ) Okay . Look . I do n't understand what you 've got in your head anymore . I really do n't . I do n't get it . Now you desperately need me . Now you ca n't live without me . NOW you 'll do anything for me . Why should I believe it this time ? EDDIE Because it 's true . MAY It was supposed to have been true every time before . Every other time . Now it 's true again . You 've been jerking me off like this for fifteen years . Fifteen years I 've been a yo-yo for you . I 've never been split . I 've never been two ways about you . I 've either loved you or not loved you . And now I just plain do n't love you . Understand ? Do you understand that ? I do n't love you . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you get that ? Now if you can still stay , then you 're either crazy or pathetic . ( She crosses down left to table , sits in upstage chair facing audience , takes slug of tequila from bottle , slams it down on table . Headlights again come slashing across the stage from up right , across audience , then disappear off left . EDDIE rushes to light switch , flips it off . Stage goes black . Exterior lights shine through. ) p. 35 EDDIE ( taking her by shoulder ) Get in the bathroom ! MAY ( pulls away ) I 'm not going in the bathroom ! I 'm not gon na ' hide in my own house ! I 'm gon na ' go out there . I 'm gon na ' go out there and tear her damn head off ! I 'm gon na ' wipe her out ! ( She moves toward stage-left door . EDDIE stops her . She screams . They struggle as MAY yells at stage-left door . ) MAY ( yelling at door ) Come on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun ! You hear me ? Bring all your weapons and your skinny silly self ! I 'll eat you alive ! ( Suddenly the stage-left door bursts open and MARTIN crashes onstage in the darkness . He 's in his mid-thirties , solidly built , wears a green plaid shirt , baggy work pants with suspenders , heavy work boots . MAY and EDDIE pull apart . MARTIN tackles EDDIE around the waist and the two of them go crashing into the stage-right bathroom door . The door booms . MAY rushes to light switch , flips it on . Lights come back up onstage . MARTIN stands over EDDIE who 's crumpled up against the wall on the floor . MARTIN is about to smash EDDIE in the face with his fist . MAY stops him with her voice. ) p. 36 MAY Martin , wait ! ( Pause . MARTIN turns and looks at MAY . EDDIE is dazed , remains on floor . MAY goes to MARTIN and pulls him away from EDDIE . ) MAY It 's okay , Martin . It 's uh  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an argument . Really . Just take it easy . All right ? ( MARTIN moves back away from EDDIE . EDDIE stays on floor . Pause . ) MARTIN Oh . I heard you screaming when I drove up and then all the lights went off . I thought somebody was trying to  --  MAY It 's okay . This is my uh  --  cousin . Eddie . MARTIN ( stares at EDDIE ) Oh . I 'm sorry . EDDIE ( grins at MARTIN ) She 's lying . MARTIN ( looks at MAY ) Oh . MAY ( moving to table ) Everything 's okay , Martin . You want a drink or something ? Why do n't you have a drink . MARTIN Yeah . Sure . EDDIE ( stays on floor ) She 's lying through her teeth . p. 37 MAY I got ta ' get some glasses . ( MAY exits quickly into bathroom , stepping over EDDIE . MARTIN stares at EDDIE . EDDIE grins back . Pause . ) EDDIE She keeps the glasses in the bathroom . Is n't that weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She goes to table , pours two drinks from bottle . ) MAY I was starting to think you were n't going to show up , Martin . MARTIN Yeah , I 'm sorry . I had to water the football field down at the high school . Forgot all about it . EDDIE Forgot all about what ? MARTIN I mean I forgot all about watering . I was halfway here when I remembered . Had to go back . EDDIE Oh , I thought you meant you forgot all about her . MARTIN Oh , no . EDDIE How far was halfway ? MARTIN Excuse me ? EDDIE How far were you when it was halfway here ? MARTIN Oh  --  uh  --  I do n't know . I guess a couple miles or so . EDDIE Couple miles ? That 's all ? Couple a ' lousy little miles ? You wan na ' know how many miles I came ? Huh ? p. 38 MAY We 've been drinking a little bit , Martin . EDDIE She has n't touched a drop . ( Pause . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , that 's my tequila , Martin . MARTIN Oh . EDDIE I do n't care if you drink it . I just want you to know where it comes from . MARTIN Thanks . EDDIE You do n't have to thank me . Thank the Mexicans . They made it . MARTIN Oh . EDDIE You should thank the entire Mexican nation in fact . We owe everything to Mexico down here . Do you realize that ? You probably do n't realize that , do ya ' . We 're sittin ' on Mexican ground right now . It 's only by chance that you and me are n't Mexican ourselves . What kinda ' people do you hail from anyway , Martin ? MARTIN Me ? Uh  --  I do n't know . I was adopted . EDDIE Oh . You must have a lotta ' problems then , huh ? MARTIN Well  --  not really , no . EDDIE No ? You orphans are supposed to steal a lot are n't ya ' ? Shoplifting and stuff . You 're also supposed to be the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTIN Really ? I never heard that . EDDIE Well , you ought a ' read the papers , Martin . ( Pause . ) MARTIN I 'm really sorry I knocked you over . I mean , I thought she was in trouble or something . EDDIE She is in trouble . MARTIN ( looks at MAY ) Oh . EDDIE She 's in big trouble . MARTIN What 's the matter , May ? MAY ( moves to bed with drink , sits ) Nothing . MARTIN How come you had the lights off ? MAY We were uh  --  just about to go out . MARTIN You were ? MAY Yeah  --  well , I mean , we were going to come back . ( MARTIN stands there between them . He looks at EDDIE , then back to MAY . Pause . ) EDDIE ( laughs ) No , no , no . That 's not what we were gon na ' do . Your name 's Martin , right ? MARTIN Yeah , right . EDDIE That 's not what we were gon na ' do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand me that bottle , please ? MARTIN ( crossing to bottle at table ) Sure . EDDIE Thanks . ( MARTIN moves back to EDDIE with bottle and hands it to him . EDDIE drinks . ) EDDIE ( after drink ) We were actually having an argument about you . That 's what we were doin ' . MARTIN About me ? EDDIE Yeah . We were actually in the middle of a big huge argument about you . It got so heated up we had to turn the lights off . MARTIN What was it about ? EDDIE It was about whether or not you 're actually a man or not . Ya ' know ? Whether you 're a " man " or just a " guy . " ( Pause . MARTIN looks at MAY . MAY smiles politely . MARTIN looks back to EDDIE . ) EDDIE See , she says you 're a man . That 's what she calls you . A " man . " Did you know that ? That 's what she calls you . MARTIN ( looks back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Martin . Do n't worry about it . p. 41 MARTIN It 's okay . I do n't mind or anything . EDDIE No , but see I uh  --  told her she was fulla ' shit . I mean I told her that way before I even saw you . And now that I see you I ca n't exactly take it back . Ya ' see what I mean , Martin ? ( Pause , MAY stands . ) MAY Martin , do you want to go to the movies ? MARTIN Well , yeah  --  I mean , that 's what I thought we were going to do . MAY So let 's go to the movies . ( She crosses fast to bathroom , steps over EDDIE , goes into bathroom , slams door , door booms . Pause as MARTIN stares at bathroom door . EDDIE stays on floor , grins at MARTIN . ) MARTIN She 's not mad or anything is she ? EDDIE You got me , buddy . MARTIN I did n't mean to make her mad . ( Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , Martin ? MARTIN I ca n't decide . EDDIE What d' ya ' mean you ca n't decide ? You 're supposed to have all that worked out ahead of time are n't ya ' ? p. 42 MARTIN Yeah , but I 'm not sure what she likes . EDDIE What 's that got to do with it ? You 're takin ' her out to the movies , right ? MARTIN Yeah . EDDIE So you pick the movie , right ? The guy picks the movie . The guy 's always supposed to pick the movie . MARTIN Yeah , but I do n't want to take her to see something she does n't want to see . EDDIE How do you know what she wants to see ? MARTIN I do n't . That 's the reason I ca n't decide . I mean what if I take her to something she 's already seen before ? EDDIE You miss the whole point , Martin . The reason you 're taking her out to the movies is n't to see something she has n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking her out to the movies is because you just want to be with her . Right ? You just wan na ' be close to her . I mean you could take her just about anywhere . MARTIN I guess . EDDIE I mean after a while you probably would n't have to take her out at all . You could just hang around here . MARTIN What would we do here ? p. 43 EDDIE Well , you could uh  --  tell each other stories . MARTIN Stories ? EDDIE Yeah . MARTIN I do n't know any stories . EDDIE Make ' em up . MARTIN That 'd be lying would n't it ? EDDIE No , no . Lying 's when you believe it 's true . If you already know it 's a lie , then it 's not lying . MARTIN ( after pause ) Do you want some help getting up off the floor ? EDDIE I like it down here . Less tension . You notice how when you 're standing up , there 's a lot more tension ? MARTIN Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm working , you know , I 'm down on my hands and knees . EDDIE What line a ' work do you follow , Martin ? MARTIN Yard work mostly . Maintenance . EDDIE Oh , lawns and stuff ? MARTIN Yeah . EDDIE You do lawns on your hands and knees ? MARTIN Well  --  edging . You know , trimming around the edges . p. 44 EDDIE Oh . MARTIN And weeding around the sprinkler heads . Stuff like that . EDDIE I get ya ' . MARTIN But I 've always noticed how much more relaxed I get when I 'm down low to the ground like that . EDDIE Yeah . Well , you could get down on your hands and knees right now if you want to . I do n't mind . MARTIN ( grins , gets embarrassed , looks at bathroom door ) Naw , I 'll stand . Thanks . EDDIE Suit yourself . You 're just gon na ' get more and more tense . ( Pause . ) MARTIN You 're uh  --  May 's cousin , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Right there . That 's a result of tension . See what I mean ? MARTIN What ? EDDIE Askin ' me if I 'm her cousin . That 's because you 're tense you 're askin ' me that . You already know I 'm not her cousin . MARTIN Well , how would I know that ? EDDIE Do I look like her cousin . MARTIN Well , she said that you were . p. 45 EDDIE ( grins ) She 's lying . ( Pause . ) MARTIN Well  --  what are you then ? EDDIE ( laughs ) Now you 're really gettin ' tense , huh ? MARTIN Look , maybe I should just go or something . I mean  --  ( MARTIN makes a move to exit stage left . EDDIE rushes to stage-left door and beats MARTIN to it . MARTIN freezes , then runs to window upstage , opens it and tries to escape . EDDIE runs to him and catches him by the back of the pants , pulls him out of the window , slams him up against stage-right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he speaks . They arrive at down-right corner . ) EDDIE No , no . Do n't go , Martin . Do n't go . You 'll just get all blue and lonely out there in the black night . I know . I 've wandered around lonely like that myself . Awful . Just eats away at ya ' . ( he puts his arm around MARTIN 'S shoulder and leads him to table down left ) Now just come on over here and sit down and we 'll have us a little drink . Okay ? MARTIN ( as he goes with EDDIE ) Uh  --  do you think she 's okay in there ? p. 46 EDDIE Sure she 's okay . She 's always okay . She just likes to take her time . Just to torture you . MARTIN Well  --  we were supposed to go to the movies . EDDIE She 'll be out . Do n't worry about it . She likes the movies . ( They sit at table , down left . EDDIE pulls out the down-right chair and seats MARTIN in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits so that he 's now partially facing THE OLD MAN . Spot rises softly on THE OLD MAN but MARTIN does not acknowledge his presence . Stage lights stay the same . MARTIN sets his glass on table . EDDIE fills it up with the bottle . THE OLD MAN 'S left arm slowly descends and reaches across the table holding out his empty Styrofoam cup for a drink . EDDIE looks THE OLD MAN in the eye for a second , then pours him a drink , too . All three of them drink . EDDIE takes his from the bottle . ) MARTIN What exactly 's the matter with her anyway ? EDDIE She 's in a state a ' shock . ( THE OLD MAN chuckles to himself . Drinks . ) MARTIN Shock ? How come ? EDDIE Well , we have n't seen each other in a long time . I mean  --  me and her , we go back quite a ways , see . High school . p. 47 MARTIN Oh . I did n't know that . EDDIE Yeah . Lotta ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDDIE No . Not really . No . MARTIN You 're  --  her husband ? EDDIE No . She 's my sister . ( he and THE OLD MAN look at each other , then he turns back to MARTIN ) My half-sister . ( Pause . EDDIE and THE OLD MAN drink . ) MARTIN Your sister ? EDDIE Yeah . MARTIN Oh . So  --  you knew each other even before high school then , huh ? EDDIE No , see , I never even knew I had a sister until it was too late . MARTIN How do you mean ? EDDIE Well , by the time I found out we 'd already  --  you know  --  fooled around . ( THE OLD MAN shakes his head , drinks . Long pause . MARTIN just stares at EDDIE . ) EDDIE ( grins ) Whatsa ' matter , Martin ? MARTIN You fooled around ? p. 48 EDDIE Yeah . MARTIN Well  --  um  --  that 's illegal , is n't it ? EDDIE I suppose so . THE OLD MAN ( to EDDIE ) Who is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's really your sister ? EDDIE Half . Only half . MARTIN Which half ? EDDIE Top half . In horses we call that the " topside . " THE OLD MAN Yeah , and the mare 's what ? The mare 's uh  --  " distaff , " is n't it ? Is n't that the bottom half ? " Distaff . " Funny I should remember that . MARTIN And you fooled around in high school together ? EDDIE Yeah . Sure . Everybody fooled around in high school . Did n't you ? MARTIN No . I never did . EDDIE Maybe you should have , Martin . MARTIN Well , not with my sister . EDDIE No , I would n't recommend that . MARTIN How could that happen ? I mean  --  EDDIE Well , see  --  ( pause , he stares at THE OLD MAN )  --  our daddy fell in love twice . That 's basically how it happened . Once with my mother and once with her mother . p. 49 THE OLD MAN It was the same love . Just got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how come you did n't know each other until high school then ? EDDIE He had two separate lives . That 's how come . Two completely separate lives . He 'd live with me and my mother for a while and then he 'd disappear and go live with her and her mother for a while . THE OLD MAN Now do n't be too hard on me , boy . It can happen to the best of us . MARTIN And you never knew what was going on ? EDDIE Nope . Neither did my mother . THE OLD MAN She knew . EDDIE ( to MARTIN ) She never knew . MARTIN She must 've suspected something was going on . EDDIE Well , if she did she never let on to me . Maybe she was afraid of finding out . Or maybe she just loved him . I do n't know . He 'd disappear for months at a time and she never once asked him where he went . She was always glad to see him when he came back . The two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him as soon as we saw the Studebaker coming across the field . THE OLD MAN ( to EDDIE ) That was no Studebaker , that was a Plymouth . I never owned a goddamn Studebaker. p. 50 EDDIE This went on for years . He kept disappearing and reappearing . For years that went on . Then , suddenly , one day it stopped . He stayed home for a while . Just stayed in the house . Never went outside . Just sat in his chair . Staring . Then he started going on these long walks . He 'd walk all day . Then he 'd walk all night . He 'd walk out across the fields . In the dark . I used to watch him from my bedroom window . He 'd disappear in the dark with his overcoat on . MARTIN Where was he going ? EDDIE Just walking . THE OLD MAN I was making a decision . ( EDDIE gets MARTIN to his feet and takes him on a walk around the entire stage as he tells the story . MARTIN is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But one night I asked him if I could go with him . And he took me . We walked straight out across the fields together . In the dark . And I remember it was just plowed and our feet sank down in the powder and the dirt came up over the tops of my shoes and weighed me down . I wanted to stop and empty my shoes out but he would n't stop . He kept walking straight ahead and I was afraid of losing him in the dark so I just kept up as best I could . And we were completely silent the whole time . Never said a word to each other . We could barely see a foot in front of us , it was so dark . And these white owls kept swooping down out of nowhere , hunting for jackrabbits . Diving right past our heads , then disappearing . And we just kept walking silent like that for miles until we got to town . I could see the drive-in movie way off in the distance . That was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then vague faces began to appear . And , as we got closer , I could recognize one of the faces . It was Spencer Tracy . Spencer Tracy moving his mouth . Speaking without words . Speaking to a woman in a red dress . Then we stopped at a liquor store and he made me wait outside in the parking lot while he bought a bottle . And there were all these Mexican migrant workers standing around a pickup truck with red mud all over the tires . They were drinking beer and laughing and I remember being jealous of them and I did n't know why . And I remember seeing the old man through the glass door of the liquor store as he paid for the bottle . And I remember feeling sorry for him and I did n't know why . Then he came outside with the bottle wrapped in a brown paper sack and as soon as he came out , all the Mexican men stopped laughing . They just stared at us as we walked away . ( During the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens  --  moonlight ) p. 51 EDDIE And we walked right through town . Past the donut shop , past the miniature golf course , past the Chevron station . And he opened the bottle up and offered it to me . Before he even took a drink , he offered it to me first . And I took it and drank it and handed it back to him . And we just kept passing it back and forth like that as we walked until we drank the whole thing dry . And we never said a word the whole time . Then , finally , we reached this little white house with a red awning , on the far side of town . I 'll never forget the red awning because it flapped in the night breeze and the porch light made it glow . It was a hot , desert breeze and the air smelled like new-cut alfalfa . We walked right up to the front porch and he rang the bell and I remember getting real nervous because I was n't expecting to visit anybody . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman comes to the door . This real pretty woman with red hair . And she throws herself into his arms . And he starts crying . He just breaks down right there in front of me . And she 's kissing him all over the face and holding him real tight and he 's just crying like a baby . And then through the doorway , behind them both , I see this girl . ( The bathroom door very slowly and silently swings open revealing MAY , standing in the doorframe backlit with yellow light in her red dress . She just watches EDDIE as he keeps telling story . He and MARTIN are unaware of her presence. ) p. 52 EDDIE She just appears . She 's just standing there , staring at me and I 'm staring back at her and we ca n't take our eyes off each other . It was like we knew each other from somewhere but we could n't place where . But the second we saw each other , that very second , we knew we 'd never stop being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Door booms . Lights bang back up to their previous setting . ) MAY ( to EDDIE ) Boy , you really are incredible ! You 're unbelievable ! Martin comes over here . He does n't know you from Adam and you start telling him a story like that . Are you crazy ? None of it 's true , Martin . He 's had this weird , sick idea for years now and it 's totally made up . He 's nuts . I do n't know where he got it from . He 's completely nuts . EDDIE ( to MARTIN ) She 's kinda ' embarrassed about the whole deal , see . You ca n't blame her really . MARTIN I did n't even know you could hear us out here , May . I  --  MAY I heard every word . I followed it very carefully . He 's told me that story a thousand times and it always changes . EDDIE I never repeat myself . MAY You do nothing but repeat yourself . That 's all you do . You just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Well , maybe I should leave . EDDIE NO ! You sit down . ( Silence . MARTIN slowly sits again . ) EDDIE ( quietly to MARTIN , leaning toward him ) Did you think that was a story , Martin ? Did you think I made that whole thing up ? MARTIN No . I mean , at the time you were telling it , it seemed real . EDDIE But now you 're doubting it because she says it 's a lie ? MARTIN Well  --  EDDIE She suggests it 's a lie to you and all of a sudden you change your mind ? Is that it ? You go from true to false like that , in a second ? MARTIN I do n't know . MAY Let 's go to the movies , Martin . ( MARTIN stands again . ) EDDIE Sit down ! ( MARTIN sits back down . Long pause . ) MAY Eddie  --  ( Pause . ) EDDIE What ? MAY We want to go to the movies . ( Pause . EDDIE just stares at her. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Martin . Right now . EDDIE Nobody 's going to the movies . There 's not a movie in this town that can match the story I 'm gon na ' tell . I 'm gon na ' finish this story . MAY Eddie  --  EDDIE You wan na ' hear the rest of the story , do n't ya ' , Martin ? MARTIN ( pause . He looks at MAY , then back to EDDIE ) Sure . MAY Martin , let 's go . Please . MARTIN I  --  ( Long pause . EDDIE and MARTIN stare at each other . ) EDDIE You what ? MARTIN I do n't mind hearing the rest of it if you want to tell the rest of it . THE OLD MAN ( to himself ) I 'm dyin ' to hear it myself . ( EDDIE leans back in his chair . Grins . ) MAY ( to EDDIE ) What do you think this is going to do ? Do you think this is going to change something ? EDDIE No . MAY Then what 's the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then why put everybody through this . Martin does n't want to hear this bullshit . I do n't want to hear it . EDDIE I know you do n't wan na ' hear it . MAY Do n't try to pass it off on me ! You got it all turned around , Eddie . You got it all turned around . You do n't even know which end is up anymore . Okay . Okay . I do n't need either of you . I do n't need any of it because I already know the rest of the story . I know the whole rest of the story , see . ( she speaks directly to EDDIE , who remains sitting ) I know it just exactly the way it happened . Without any little tricks added onto it . ( THE OLD MAN leans over to EDDIE , confidentially . ) THE OLD MAN What does she know ? EDDIE ( to THE OLD MAN ) She 's lying . ( Lights begin to shift down again in the course of MAY 'S story . She moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she tells it . ) MAY You want me to finish the story for you , Eddie ? Huh ? You want me to finish this story ? ( Pause as MARTIN sits again. ) p. 56 MAY See , my mother  --  the pretty red-haired woman in the little white house with the red awning  --  was desperately in love with the old man . Was n't she , Eddie ? You could tell that right away . You could see it in her eyes . She was obsessed with him to the point where she could n't stand being without him for even a second . She kept hunting for him from town to town . Following little clues that he left behind , like a postcard maybe , or a motel on the back of a matchbook. ( to MARTIN ) He never left her a phone number or an address or anything as simple as that because my mother was his secret , see . She hounded him for years and he kept trying to keep her at a distance because the closer these two separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two separate kids , the more nervous he got . The more filled with terror that the two lives would find out about each other and devour him whole . That his secret would take him by the throat . But finally she caught up with him . Just by a process of elimination she dogged him down . I remember the day we discovered the town . She was on fire . " This is it ! " she kept saying ; " this is the place ! " Her whole body was trembling as we walked through the streets , looking for the house where he lived . She kept squeezing my hand to the point where I thought she 'd crush the bones in my fingers . She was terrified she 'd come across him by accident on the street because she knew she was trespassing . She knew she was crossing this forbidden zone but she could n't help herself . We walked all day through that stupid hick town . All day long . We went through every neighborhood , peering through every open window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him . ( Rest . ) It was just exactly suppertime and they were all sitting down at the table and they were having fried chicken . That 's how close we were to the window . We could see what they were eating . We could hear their voices but we could n't make out what they were saying . Eddie and his mother were talking but the old man never said a word . Did he , Eddie ? Just sat there eating his chicken in silence . p. 57 THE OLD MAN ( to EDDIE ) Boy , is she ever off the wall with this one . You got ta ' do somethin ' about this . MAY The funny thing was , that almost as soon as we 'd found him  --  he disappeared . She was only with him about two weeks before he just vanished . Nobody saw him after that . Ever . And my mother  --  just turned herself inside out . I never could understand that . I kept watching her grieve , as though somebody 'd died . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the floor . And I could n't understand that because I was feeling the exact opposite feeling . I was in love , see . I 'd come home after school , after being with Eddie , and I was filled with this joy and there she 'd be  --  standing in the middle of the kitchen staring at the sink . Her eyes looked like a funeral . And I did n't know what to say . I did n't even feel sorry for her . All I could think of was him . THE OLD MAN ( to EDDIE ) She 's gettin ' way outa ' line , here . MAY And all he could think of was me . Is n't that right , Eddie . We could n't take a breath without thinking of each other . We could n't eat if we were n't together . We could n't sleep . We got sick at night when we were apart . Violently sick . And my mother even took me to see a doctor . And Eddie 's mother took him to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with us . He thought it was the flu or something . And Eddie 's mother had no idea what was wrong with him . But my mother  --  my mother knew exactly what was wrong . She knew it clear down to her bones . She recognized every symptom . And she begged me not to see him but I would n't listen . Then she begged Eddie not to see me but he would n't listen . Then she went to Eddie 's mother and begged her . And Eddie 's mother  --  ( pause . She looks straight at EDDIE )  --  Eddie 's mother blew her brains out . Did n't she , Eddie ? Blew her brains right out . p. 58 THE OLD MAN ( standing . He moves from the platform onto the stage , between EDDIE and MAY ) Now , wait a second ! Wait a second . Just a goddamn second here . This story does n't hold water . ( To EDDIE , who stays seated ) You 're not gon na ' let her off the hook with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version I ever heard in my whole life . She never blew her brains out . Nobody ever told me that . Where the hell did that come from ? ( to EDDIE , who remains seated ) Stand up ! Get on yer feet now goddammit ! I wan na ' hear the male side a ' this thing . You got ta ' represent me now . Speak on my behalf . There 's no one to speak for me now ! Stand up ! ( EDDIE stands slowly . Stares at THE OLD MAN . ) THE OLD MAN Now tell her . Tell her the way it happened . We 've got a pact . Do n't forget that . EDDIE ( calmly to THE OLD MAN ) It was your shotgun . Same one we used to duck-hunt with . Browning . She never fired a gun before in her life . That was her first time . THE OLD MAN Nobody told me any a ' that . I was left completely in the dark . EDDIE You were gone . THE OLD MAN Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I was n't that impossible to find . p. 59 EDDIE You were gone . THE OLD MAN That 's right , I was gone ! I was gone . You 're right . But I was n't disconnected . There was nothing cut off in me . Everything went on just the same as though I 'd never left . ( to MAY ) But your mother  --  your mother would n't give it up , would she ? ( THE OLD MAN moves toward MAY and speaks directly to her . MAY keeps her eyes on EDDIE , who very slowly turns toward her in the course of THE OLD MAN 'S speech . Once their eyes meet they never leave each other 's gaze . ) THE OLD MAN ( to MAY ) She drew me to her . She went out of her way to draw me in . She was a force . I told her I 'd never come across for her . I told her that right from the very start . But she opened up to me . She would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could I turn her down when she loved me like that ? How could I turn away from her ? We were completely whole . ( EDDIE and MAY just stand there staring at each other . THE OLD MAN moves back to EDDIE . Speaks to him directly . ) THE OLD MAN ( to EDDIE ) What 're you doin ' ? Speak to her . Bring her around to our side . You got ta ' make her see this thing in a clear light . ( Very slowly EDDIE and MAY move toward each other. ) p. 60 THE OLD MAN ( to EDDIE ) Stay away from her ! What the hell are you doin ' ? Keep away from her ! You two ca n't come together ! You got ta ' hold up my end a ' this deal . I got nobody now ! Nobody ! You ca n't betray me ! You got ta ' represent me now ! You 're my son ! ( EDDIE and MAY come together center stage . They embrace . They kiss each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , cutting across the stage through window , then disappearing off left . Sound of loud collision , shattering glass , an explosion . Bright orange and blue light of a gasoline fire suddenly illuminates upstage window . Then sounds of horses screaming wildly , hooves galloping on pavement , fading , then total silence . Light of gas fire continues now to end of play . EDDIE and MAY never stop holding each other through all this . Long pause . No one moves . Then MARTIN stands and moves upstage to window , peers out through Venetian blinds . Pause . ) MARTIN ( upstage at window , looking out into flames ) Is that your truck with the horse trailer out there ? EDDIE ( stays with MAY ) Yeah . MARTIN It 's on fire . EDDIE Yeah . MARTIN All the horses are loose . p. 61 EDDIE ( steps back away from MAY ) Yeah , I figured . MAY Eddie  --  EDDIE ( to MAY ) I 'm just gon na ' go out and take a look . I got ta ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAY What difference does it make ? EDDIE Well , I ca n't just let her get away with that . What am I supposed to do ? ( moves toward stage-left door ) I 'll just be a second . MAY Eddie  --  EDDIE I 'm only gon na ' be a second . I 'll just take a look at it and I 'll come right back . Okay ? ( EDDIE exits stage-left door . MAY stares at door , stays where she is . MARTIN stays upstage . MARTIN turns slowly from window upstage and looks at MAY . Pause . MAY moves to bed , pulls suitcase out from underneath , throws it on bed and opens it . She goes into bathroom and comes out with clothes . She packs the clothes in suitcase . MARTIN watches her for a while , then moves slowly downstage to her as she continues . ) MARTIN May  --  ( MAY goes back into bathroom and comes back out with more clothes . She packs them. ) p. 62 MARTIN Do you need some help or anything ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want . ( pause . MAY just keeps packing her clothes ) Are you going to go with him ? ( She stops . Straightens up . Stares at MARTIN . Pause . ) MAY He 's gone . MARTIN He said he 'd be back in a second . MAY ( pause ) He 's gone . ( MAY exits with suitcase out stage-left door . She leaves the door open behind her . MARTIN just stands there staring at open door for a while . THE OLD MAN looks stage left at his rocking chair , then a little above it , in blank space . Pause . THE OLD MAN starts moving slowly back to platform . ) THE OLD MAN ( pointing into space , stage left ) Ya ' see that picture over there ? Ya ' see that ? Ya ' know who that is ? That 's the woman of my dreams . That 's who that is . And she 's mine . She 's all mine . Forever . ( He reaches rocking chair , sits , but keeps staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair . After THE OLD MAN sits in rocker , Merle Haggard 's " I 'm the One Who Loves You " starts playing as lights begin a very slow fade . MARTIN moves slowly upstage to window and stops . He stares out with his back to audience . The fire glows through window as stage lights fade . OLD MAN keeps rocking slowly . Stage lights keep fading slowly to black . Fire glows for a while in the dark , then cuts to black . Song continues in dark and swells in volume. )
