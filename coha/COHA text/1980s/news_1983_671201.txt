" Coach Paterno told the team that he hoped we would love each other , " Lyle said , " because a little bit of each of us is inside one another . And it was true . It helped make us a strong team . We grew together in love - hating the coach. " // Paterno , behind tinted glasses , smiles when he relates the story . Joe Paterno is a winning coach - his team last season , for example , was chosen No. 1 in the polls ; he has a reputation for driving his players on the field as well as toward receiving a degree . But as tough as he might be on the field , he has often been regarded as fair. // Since New Year ' s night , when his team beat Georgia and Herschel Walker in the Sugar Bowl to establish itself as the top team in the nation , Paterno has seemed as active as ever. // Which does not always make him beloved . The coach of the No. 1 team continues to do and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 in San Diego he made a speech at the National Collegiate Athletic Association convention and became embroiled in a national controversy . He spoke out in support of Proposition 48 , which takes effect in 1986 and is designed to raise academic standards for athletes . In his speech he said that major colleges for too long had " raped " many athletes , especially blacks . " We have taken from them and not given back in kind , " said Paterno . But the proposition was interpreted by many black educators as an attempt to lessen the impact of blacks on college sports . And Paterno was branded as a " racist " for his remarks. // A month later he spoke before the board of trustees at Penn State and said the school needed a better library , an improved environment for dissent and expression of controversial ideas , more minorities , and a stimulus from " lazy profs who are only concerned with tenure. " // Then Paterno spoke on the " Phil Donohue Show " about Proposition 48 and the corruption in college athletics ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same. // He has always been outspoken on these subjects , but his voice now is heard more loudly than ever . " This is the best time of all for me , " Paterno said recently . " I can get people ' s ears because my team was ranked number one in the polls . What is number one ? It ' s just some subjective determination . But people are impressed with it . Fine. " // " There ' s been a lot of money involved in college sports - especially with the bonanza of television - and schools have often been unprepared for it , " he went on . " College presidents are understanding it now , and getting involved . There were 100 college presidents at the N.C.A.A. convention in January . That ' s a record. " // The college presidents were there to try to curb abuses that have resulted in recruiting scandals and classroom scandals , at schools from Southern California to Clemson to Creighton . Athletes have received under-the-table payments , they haven ' t had to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to read. // " I think most of the schools and coaches try to do the right thing , " said Paterno . " Right now , the coaches on the standards committee are calling for higher standards even more than the presidents. " // Paterno says the educational problems start early and reach a crucial point in the high schools . " I was looking recently at a possible recruit , " said Paterno , " and his coach said , ' Oh , the boy ' s grades are fine , he ' s got a 2 . ' Well , I looked at his transcript . He got D ' s in subjects like English and math but A ' s in physical education and in courses like , and I ' m not exaggerating , ' Bachelor Living. ' " // Paterno is a tough coach , all , including the coach , agree . Although he has detractors , his record for dealing with players on the field and off is generally considered excellent. // This is sometimes unusual in a football coach at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Vincent Paterno , a kid from Avenue R and 26th Street in Brooklyn , who went to an Ivy League college ( Brown ) , majored in English Literature , played quarterback , planned to be a lawyer , but took a job as an assistant football coach for one season to help defray law school expenses . One season turned into another , and then another. // In 1966 he took his first job as a head coach , at Penn State . One season turned into another , and then another . He never went to law school. // Paterno ' s 17-year record as head coach is one of the best in college football - 162 victories , 34 defeats , 1 tie . And the record of Penn State football players ' earning their degrees also ranks among the best . Of the 41 who were in the National Football League two years ago , 38 , or 90 percent , had earned degrees . Only Notre Dame has done better. // All this was accomplished with Penn State , unlike some college football powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collegiate Athletic Association , and never being involved in a recruiting or grade-fixing scandal of any kind. // Paterno is a casual man who wears glasses that tint in bright lights and a ski jacket over his suit . His straight black hair is flecked with gray . At 56 , he does seem to treat his position as a football coach with perspective. // In fact , he insists that his players call him Joe . Once , Greg Buttle , now with the Jets , said , " Hey , Coach , can I do this ? " Paterno turned to him and said , " No , do it this way , Player. " // On his own campus Paterno is sometimes the object of severe criticism . " I don ' t know Joe Paterno personally , but as a concept I don ' t think much of him , " said John Swinton , an instructor in the department of food service and housing administration. // " He says football should be fun , " said Swinton , " yet he won ' t open practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " He says he graduates a lot of players , but I ' ve challenged him and I haven ' t seen the statistics . But he goes along because he wins , and brings in millions. // " But he remains a very popular figure on campus . And the football stadium , I must admit , is a wonderful place to be on a Saturday afternoon. " // Is Joe Paterno a con man , or is he real ? " No , he ' s genuine , " said Linda Blackledge , the mother of Todd Blackledge , the Penn State quarterback who is graduating Phi Beta Kappa . " I always thought he had Todd ' s best interests at heart . I think going to Penn State and playing for Joe was the best choice Todd could have made. " // Earlier this year , Mike McCloskey , the tight end , said that Paterno had frequently singled him out in practice for verbal assaults on the level of a drill sergeant. // McCloskey said it took him a couple of years to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " He was trying to squeeze out every bit of my potential , " said McCloskey . " We ' ve had players who never did understand , and they quit or transferred. " // Paterno is asked if college football is supposed to be an educational experience - just an extracurricular activity within the scope of the university ? // " Yes , " he said , " and that ' s the dilemma. " // Paterno ' s most attacked stand came when he spoke before a large audience of college educators at the N.C.A.A. meeting in San Diego last month. // Proposition 48 says that a high school senior , to compete in college sports as a freshman , would have to earn a combined score of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 15 on the American College Testing program and graduate from high school with a grade-point average of 2. 0 of a possible 4. 0. // Also , the high school curriculum should include 11 designated core subjects , such as English and math . Paterno thinks that what ' s more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athlete to receive a grant-in-aid from a college though not allowing him to compete as a freshman. // " I ' ve always been opposed to freshmen eligible for varsity sports , anyway , " said Paterno . " I think a student needs his first year as a period of adjustment into college life . With Proposition 49B , the student who doesn ' t reach the academic standards before entering college , can , with diligence , get his grades up so that he can be eligibile for sports during his following years in school. " // The shortcomings of " intelligence " tests were made an issue : built-in cultural bias , they do not consider socio-economic backgrounds , and so forth . Which in part explains why fewer than 50 percent of black students score 700 or higher on the S.A.T. , compared to 75 percent of white students. // Paterno thinks that black students can rise to the challenge . He says he has had enough blacks on his team to see that they are capable of meeting any challenge that whites can meet. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is predominately white , " Paterno told the meeting , " but I have had the privilege of working with many great black players . I ' m surprised to see black leaders standing here and selling the black students down the river , selling them short. " // Chancellor Charles Lyons Jr. of Fayetteville ( N.C. ) State University , expressed the feeling of many black leaders at predominately black universities . He wrote to Paterno : // " I deeply resent your statement about ' black leaders selling their black students down the river . ' ( Some of these leaders ) have spent their entire professional careers giving opportunity to low income and deprived black youngsters , but for ( these leaders ) and institutions which they head , these youngsters would forever languish and perish on the scrap heap of humanity. " // Paterno was moved by the letter , and says he has cooled some of his comments about " selling black students down the river , " but he remains staunch in his views on better education for blacks. // " I know they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " said Paterno . The worst thing for disadvantaged college students , said Paterno , was the embarrassent of going to class and not having been prepared in high school , or earlier. // " They ' ve got a lot of pride in themselves - especially as athletes , " said Paterno . " But when they go into a classroom and are swamped , they begin to despair . They start cutting class , then stop going . They give us so much , we ' ve got to give them a lot more than we have. " // Whether lip service or not , Paterno feels he ought to say these things , and he does. //
