LORETTA SWIT , MR . T and other celebrities ham it up in some new Burger King commercials . But the real star of the ads is the Whopper , which was recently beefed up to provide stiffer competition for Wendy ' s and the Big Mac . Using a special lens , director Elbert Budin filmed the burger from less than an inch away to make it look gargantuan . To create an ideal bun , extra sesame seeds were pasted on with tweezers and egg white . Water was squirted on the tomatoes to give them a " dewy , fresh look , " and the condiments were dabbed on meticulously with Q-tips . Says Mr. Budin : " We tried to get the Whopper as perfect as possible without making it appear pristine . Food must always remain earthy and approachable . " Although shooting pictures of food and beverages may seem rudimentary , advertisers fuss as much over corn flakes and TV dinners as they do over stunning fashion models . The lighting in a recent Wendy ' s commercial was done by John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the movie , " Barry Lyndon . " On the Duncan Hines account at Saatchi &; Saatchi Compton Inc. , employees are required to bake brownies and blueberry muffins themselves to get to know the products intimately . Even Vice Chairman Philip Voss spent an afternoon flipping hamburgers for Krystal ' s , the agency ' s fast-food restaurant client . " It ' s much more interesting to work all day with Christie Brinkley than with a tomato , " says Charles Piccirillo , executive creative director at Leber Katz Partners , an ad agency . " But food can really look bland on a big TV screen if you don ' t pay attention to the tiniest of details . " THE AIM of food advertising , of course , is to make people lick their chops and rush out to a restaurant or supermarket . Seldom are actors in commercials shown eating food because that might turn consumers off . " People shoving food in their mouths isn ' t the greatest thing to look at , " Mr. Voss says . " What you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the product . " But increasingly the food in commercials does more than just sit there and look succulent . Recently , there have been flying potato chips and pickles , talking sandwiches and a bacon cheeseburger cruising along an expressway . " That stuff is as expensive as blazes , " says Paul Mulcahy , president of Campbell Soup Co. ' s in-house advertising agency . " You have to wonder if a nicely decorated plate isn ' t as effective as food hurtling through the air . " But even simple advertisements can be painstaking ordeals because food products seldom behave the way directors want . For one thing , food is very temperamental under hot lights . Directors say they must be careful that the tops of hamburger buns don ' t dry out and cave in or that raw meat doesn ' t turn a sickly brown . They also must be sure that beer gushes into a mug at just the right speed and with just the right amount of head . NO ONE KNOWS more about such challenges than Ralcie Ceass , supervisor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bisquick TV commercial , she may cook 1 , 000 pancakes to come up with enough that have a smooth contour and golden-brown color . " It ' s especially important that food looks gorgeous on package labels , " she says , " because the box sits on the grocery shelf for days surrounded by competing brands . " Indeed , Victor Scocozza , who does package shots , says some finicky ad agency people insist that he photograph a piece of cake on a plate first with four crumbs , then eight crumbs , then 12 crumbs . He once spent 7 1/2 hours on a single chocolate-chip cookie . In trying to glorify food , companies may go too far . Last year the Council of Better Business Bureaus concluded that ads for Old El Paso sauce misrepresented the thickness of the product . The council also objected to a Mauna Loa commercial that seemed to show only whole macadamia nuts . A consumer had complained that jars typically contain many broken nuts . " But by and large , advertisements are far more honest today than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a so-called food stylist who gussies up food for photo sessions . " Years ago , we would have used milk of magnesia in a picture for cream of mushroom soup . " CAMPBELL SOUP was cited in 1969 by the Federal Trade Commission for adding marbles to bowls of vegetable soup so it would look chunkier . Now , the company says , it polices its advertising scrupulously . To ensure that the soup shown in ads is representative , the company purchases it at random in grocery stores . Vegetables and meat are evenly split between the two bowls that come from each can . And top marketing and legal executives scrutinize proofs of each ad to make sure that during the printing process a pale yellow broth doesn ' t magically turn golden . While fewer ads are downright misleading these days , companies still fudge a lot . For example , maraschino-cherry syrup is painted on ham for appetite appeal . Some products are sprayed with glycerin to make them glisten . Cigarette smoke and humidifiers are used to simulate steam for baked goods . And plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual corn flakes and applies a chemical fixative so that when they are poured from a box and collide in mid-air , little pieces don ' t break off . " We never actually cheat , " Mr. Howard says . " We merely handle the food in a different way than a housewife would . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
