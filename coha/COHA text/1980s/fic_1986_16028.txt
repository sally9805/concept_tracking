FADE IN : CREDITS BEGIN : EXT . NOVA ROBOTICS PROVING GROUND - DAY The sounds of BIRDS and a gentle BREEZE drift across a flower covered field . We linger on this peaceful scene until the mood is shattered by an army tank suddenly RUMBLING over the horizon . A few trucks and a half-track filled with SOLDIERS follow the tank . They keep advancing until they 're halfway across the open field . We SEE what appears to be a machine gun pill box hidden in the tall grass . A port slides open and suddenly , odd-sounding red laser beams shoot out . The beams slice through the air , blasting the trucks and half-track . They are blown onto their sides and EXPLODE . The tank keeps rolling forward until a laser beam hits it , blowing off the tank 's turret like a tiddly-wink . Again we hear the BREEZE . In the distance , THUNDER , as the sky darkens . CLOSER ANGLES ON the charred , smoldering field . The wreckage of soldiers and vehicles is everywhere . WE MOVE IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g . The soldier is a mannequin . ON PILL BOX The pill box closes it 's port . Then , unexpectedly , it transforms itself into a mobile , armored robot . Its head and eyes resemble binoculars set atop a long pole of a neck .

" The ROBOT rolls on treads up to the bleachers . It takes its place in a line of four other robots , all identical except for their camouflage paint jobs ( jungle , desert , snow , etc . ) These are prototypes for S. A. I. N.

Were n't we supposed to meet him ? &nbsp; MARNER ( covering glibly ) Well , Senator , I 'm afraid Dr. Crosby stays inside . He claims that fresh air gets him " over oxidized " or something .

A surge of ELECTRICITY SIZZLES along the power lines to the lab rooftop where a junction box EXPLODES . Zack and Norman leap back as their electronic equipment INCINERATES in a BLAST of SPARKS . SPARKS ZAP from the cables connected to Number Five . The robot leaps straight up , scintillating in a web of slithering ELECTRICITY .

Of course , we wo n't be making a dime on them at that . &nbsp; MILLSReally ?  --  10  --  Just then , doors open and the four gleaming S.A.I.N.T . robots RUMBLE into the room . Marner welcomes the interruption . &nbsp; MARNERAh ! Ladies and Gentlemen , our prototypes are here . He counts heads as the robots roll past . His face twitches as he sees one is missing . He spots Ben in the doorway , beckoning frantically , looking very upset . Marner heads for him . &nbsp; MARNERWhat 's wrong ? Where 's Number Five ? &nbsp; BENWe . . . we do n't exactly know . . . exactly . It left the debriefing station and then just . . . disappeared .

I 've got half of Washington upstairs . Crosby enters the room , Ben right on his heels . &nbsp; MARNERWhere the hell have you been ? &nbsp; CROSBYHob-nobbing . Phillips , very relieved , leaps out of the Master Control chair . &nbsp; PHILLIPSThe guys downstairs said Number Five got hit with a power surge . &nbsp; CROSBYAnd it did n't shut itself down ? . . .

It does n't get angry . It does n't get happy . It does n't laugh at your jokes . . . &nbsp; CROSBY/BENIt just runs programs . &nbsp; STONEWALL ( to himself ) Except when it 's pissed off . &nbsp; CROSBYAnybody try the homing device yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He types a command . &nbsp; CROSBYC'mon you guys , use your heads , OK ?

How are we ever going to know what 's wrong with it if you let Stonewall blow it up ? Let 's at least try to catch it first , okay ? &nbsp; MARNERAnd if we do n't catch it ? If that unit goes out and melts down a busload of nuns ? Would you like to write the press release on that one ? &nbsp; CROSBYOkay , okay . But let 's think first and panic later . He studies the monitor screen .  --  17  --  &nbsp; CROSBYNow look where it is . Even at top speed it ca n't reach any populated area for at least twenty minutes .
