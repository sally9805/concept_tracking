New Yorkers pounding the pavement got a break from the weatherman again today , but mediators put a damper on hopes that an end was near in the 11-day bus and subway strike . Mediator Walter Gellhorn said " no packages , deals or conclusions " were reached in negotiations yesterday to end the strike by 35,000 transit workers that has forced 3.5 million commuters to find other ways of getting to work . But , he added , " As you can see , things have not been at a standstill ... and an effort will be made ( today ) to reach a conclusion . " Mayor Edward Koch declined to speculate , saying , " I don ' t want people to be treated like yo-yos . " Although morning traffic was brisk under sunny skies today , there were no major problems reported . " We ' ve got everything going for us today , " said Traffic Commissioner Thomas Guthrie , " the weather and everybody ' s experience with the strike . " Talks were resuming today as Gov . Hugh Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and total business losses reached an estimated $1 billion . Meanwhile , a federal mediator reported a " major breakthrough " in contract talks between seven unions and the Long Island Rail Road . Richard O. Harris said an agreement could be reached in two days . Employees of the nation ' s busiest commuter line struck for 31 hours last week and had threatened to walk out again if they did not win a contract to replace the one that expired 15 months ago . Word of progress in the LIRR dispute came Thursday as warm and clear skies over Manhattan made walking , biking and skating to work a little easier for thousands of commuters . But flooded streets from a record 3.4-inch rainfall Wednesday slowed traffic on major arteries . A striking bus driver was arrested and accused of faking a car breakdown to obstruct the path of a private bus . Another bus was hit with shots from a pellet gun and the tires of a third were slashed . Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Richard Ravitch said there had been some movement in talks and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Monteleone , who has fined the unions $1 million , had said there appeared to be a good possibility for a settlement soon . His comment came after he put a contempt hearing against the Transport Workers Union on hold at the request of state officials who said it might adversely affect the talks . Monteleone said his optimistic word came from Gellhorn , but the mediator , while not disputing the accuracy of the remarks attributed to him , said discussion of an impending settlement must be regarded " as rumors and entirely speculative . " According to sources involved in the talks , bargaining has centered on increased productivity and cost-reducing proposals that the MTA has insisted be tied to any new pay offer for the union members , who earn an average of $18,000 a year . The union is demanding a 25 percent wage increase over two years . The MTA offered 12 percent . The city has estimated businesses are losing $100 million each day due to the strike .
