The Democrats soared in San Francisco , but can they beat Reagan ? <P> It was a typical convention-ending scene : thousands of balloons descending toward the packed floor , the band blaring rousing music , the delegates waving small American flags , colored spotlights panning the rostrum , washing over the smiling , happy candidates . But what happened in San Francisco last week was more than a ritual display of party unity . The cheers were genuine , and so were the tears of joy that flowed unabashedly from the eyes of many delegates . The Democrats knew they were making history : the woman up on the podium was the first ever selected for national office by a major party . As Geraldine Ferraro had told them earlier in accepting her nomination ( by acclamation ) as the vice-presidential candidate , " By choosing a woman to run for our nation 's second-highest office , you send a powerful signal to all Americans . There are no doors we can not unlock . " <P> It was not the first time tears flowed at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made . Two nights before , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , voice hoarse , shirt soaked with sweat , had moved even delegates opposed to him with an evangelical plea for " the desperate , the damned , the disinherited , the disrespected and the despised .

So much so , that amid all the cadenced fire , it was a simple declaration , one that would have sounded anticlimactic from anyone else , that many delegates waited most eagerly to hear : " I will be proud to support the nominee of this convention . " <P> But all the history , all the tears-what were they leading toward ? In the most emotional moments , every delegate on the floor of the Moscone Center knew that Presidential Nominee Walter Mondale , no matter how galvanizing his choice of ticket mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , when presidential nominations are decided in primaries and caucuses and Vice Presidents are chosen by their running mates , a convention has functions other than picking a ticket . It serves as a kind of combined pep rally to lift the spirits of a party 's electoral foot soldiers and a huge free TV commercial to put a campaign message , as phrased by the party 's best orators , before the public . A divided and bickering convention can destroy a candidacy , but a harmonious and uplifting one may bring little more than a temporary boost in popularity .
