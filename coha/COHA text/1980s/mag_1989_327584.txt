After completing their medical-history forms , patients at the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City , Ill. , are asked an unusual question : Would they be willing to write a letter thanking the nine U.S. Supreme Court Justices for the right to have an abortion ? Few refuse . Says Lori , 30 , a businesswoman who terminated her pregnancy there earlier this month : " It really makes me mad that they are trying to outlaw it . " <P> For months , proabortion advocates have been desperately trying to harness the anger of women like Lori . The reason : they fear that the high court , with its newly conservative majority , may tamper with the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling , which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973 . Last week the court seemed to take a tentative step in that direction by announcing that it will hear Webster v. Reproductive Health Services . The case involves a 1986 Missouri abortion law that would have put a number of obstacles in the way of a woman seeking abortion . <P> Defenders of abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Law Professor Walter Dellinger : " This is not a case that needs to be heard unless the court wants to review Roe v. Wade . " Since the court 's last major abortion ruling in 1986 , Justice Lewis Powell , who was part of the pro-choice majority , has been replaced by Justice Anthony Kennedy . Choice advocates feel Kennedy would not have been appointed unless President Reagan believed he was willing to strike down Roe . The increasingly vocal right-to- life supporters , smelling possible victory for their cause , were delighted by the court 's decision to hear the Missouri case . <P> Galvanized by the threat to Roe , pro-choice groups have embarked on an all- out lobbying effort . The National Organization for Women is planning a huge march in Washington on April 9 . The National Abortion Rights Action League is organizing a drive to send a million postcards to the high court . Another tactic is to elicit a large outpouring of friend-of-court briefs from groups like bar associations , civil rights organizations , Senators and Congressmen , and population-control organizations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Association to file a brief on the medical advantages of legal abortions . Advocates of such operations see them as the only safe alternative to often fatal clandestine methods , symbolized by the coat-hanger emblems on many pro-choice posters . The view that abortion at least does not harm women got a boost last week from a surprising source : Surgeon General C. Everett Koop , who , after a year of study , found no proof that women obtaining legal abortions suffered a greater incidence of physical or psychological harm than women who brought their pregnancies to term . <P> Some critics of the pro-choice strategy argue that efforts to lobby the court may do more harm than good . " A letter-writing campaign is a wonderful thing to do if you 're trying to persuade Congress or the Missouri legislature , " says an experienced Supreme Court lawyer . " It 's not what you do to the Supreme Court of the United States . " But NOW President Molly Yard counters that " the court is influenced by public opinion , as is every other political institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the future of abortion rights , may be put to a decisive test this term .
