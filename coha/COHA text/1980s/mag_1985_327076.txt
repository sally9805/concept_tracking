The documentary that television viewers saw on CBS on Jan. 23 , 1982 , was glossy and seamless . In The Uncounted Enemy : A Vietnam Deception , CBS 's Mike Wallace , his voice resonating with authority , charged that there had been a " conspiracy at the highest levels of American military intelligence " to underreport enemy troop strength in Viet Nam in order to deceive President Lyndon Johnson and the American people into believing that the U.S. was winning the war . <P> For the past three months , a six-man , six-woman jury in a federal courtroom in Manhattan has been listening to witnesses for General William Westmoreland , former commander of U.S. forces in Viet Nam , tell a very different story . By painstakingly unraveling The Uncounted Enemy , Westmoreland 's principal attorney , Dan Burt , is trying to convince the jury that the only public deception was by CBS , not by Westmoreland and the high command in Saigon . Last Tuesday , Westmoreland rested his case in his $120 million libel suit against the network . CBS Lawyer David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back together in an effort to show that it was true , or at the very least that CBS had every reason to believe it was true . <P> The trial has offered a glimpse into the workings of television . Most of the field reporting was of course done not by Correspondent Wallace  --  that is not his job  --  but by a CBS producer , George Crile . His task was difficult . In sorting through events more than a decade old , Crile had to discount the prejudices and bitterness left over from a war riddled with ambiguities . His sources sometimes waffled and contradicted each other . After 80 interviews , Crile had to whittle down dozen of hours of videotape and volumes of information into a tight 70-minute package . By necessity , most of the evidence wound up on the cutting-room floor . <P> In a courtroom studded with ten television monitors , Burt tried to build his case by contrasting the documentary as it was aired with CBS 's outtakes , the portions of filmed interviews that were cut from the program . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Was President Johnson a difficult man to feed bad news about the war ? " Westmoreland 's answer strongly implies that the general had a motive for being less than frank with the President : " Well , Mike , you know as well as I do that people in senior positions love good news . Politicians or leaders in countries are inclined to shoot the messenger that brings the bad news . Certainly he wanted bad news like a hole in the head . " Yet Burt brought out that CBS had cut Westmoreland 's next remarks : " He welcomed good news . But he was given both the good and the bad . . . " Confronting Crile on the witness stand , Burt demanded : " Omitting the portion where General Westmoreland said he ( Johnson ) was given both the good and the bad distorts what General Westmoreland said , does it not , sir ? " Crile 's response was that Wallace 's question turned on what it was like to give bad news .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
