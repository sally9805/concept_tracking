Augusta , Ga.  --  If you plan to watch the Masters Golf Tournament on television this weekend , and want to get into the spirit of the event , here are a few things you might do . First , proper attire is important ; shirt and trousers please , underwear definitely is out . Next , don ' t whoop or holler if a golfer you don ' t like flubs a shot . Spectators are requested to " encourage " the competitors or remain silent . And that beer you ' ll be drinking  --  dispose of the container in a trash receptacle when you are done with it . It won ' t do to make a mess . This is the Masters , where form is important , whether you are watching or playing . " We set out from the beginning to create a high standard of excellence for every facet of our event , " says Hord Hardin , the affable , retired St. Louis banker who runs the tourney . " We think we ' ve succeeded to a large degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has stayed that way . It is a public event ( one of golf ' s four " majors " ) with a distinctly private pedigree and ambiance . Bobby Jones , the Brahmin grand slammer of the 1920s , is a founder of the Augusta National Golf Club and its annual tourney , and now , as then , participation is by invitation only . A player has to be a winner or high finisher in other events to get an initial bid to play . If anything , it may be tougher to get a ticket to watch the thing than to perform in it these days . One-day tickets are sold for the early-week practice rounds , but once championship play commences on Thursday of Masters week , admittance is by full-tourney subscription only . The club began selling out in advance in 1971 , and its waiting list has been closed since 1975 . How many people are admitted ? The club won ' t say . " We don ' t think it ' s pertinent , " says Mr. Hardin . ( The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 . ) And watching the Masters , in turn , is infinitely easier than either joining Augusta National or , even , getting to play on the course . The club ' s membership numbers about 300 , all wealthy , white males , the youngest of whom is in his mid-30s . One does not apply for membership , one is tapped . Golf magazine last year listed the club among the 50 " snobbiest " in the U.S. Likewise , one must be invited to play , and a member must be present in every foursome . This is in sharp contrast to some other clubs that host tournaments in part so that their courses will become famous and members can make points by issuing wholesale guest passes to people they ' d like to impress . Exclusivity is heightened by the fact that the course is closed during the summer months . That might seem like closing a church for Easter , but it makes sense to members . " Few of us live around Augusta , and we all belong to other clubs . We play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . Mr. Hardin says that he is pained by the necessity of maintaining a ticket waiting list , if only because " a lot of people don ' t believe us when we say we can ' t accommodate them , and it makes for a lot of unpleasant explaining . " He rejects the charge of snobbishness , saying that members are chosen on the basis of compatibility and love of golf , not wealth or social status . " We only admit people who are nice after they lose . They aren ' t easy to find , " he smilingly avers . He does not dispute that it is difficult to get an invite to play at Augusta National . " Why , if we let on everyone who wanted to come , we ' d have to have starting times , just like the municipal courses , " he exclaims . The Masters also distinguishes itself by putting the screws to television and rejecting commercial interests the Masters considers extraneous , which is to say all of them . In sports , this is akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Christmas Eve . CBS has carried the tourney for 31 years , in part because it agrees to limit advertising and refrain from mentioning crass things that displease Masters officials , including attendance figures and the event ' s cash prizes ( the winner took home $126 , 000 last year ) . Not only does the Masters do without corporate sponsorship , but no corporate symbols are permitted on the course . Even the spigots that dispense beer and soda pop at refreshment stands are unmarked , and patrons must ask which brands are available . The golfers , too , must follow an etiquette that ' s stringent even for their decorous sport . Winners , for example , are expected to write what used to be called bread-and-butter letters to the Masters ' chairman , saying how much they enjoyed participating in the event . Some of the letters are reprinted in the tourney record books distributed to the press . Everybody puts up with it because the Masters is , simply , a glorious event . Augusta National is built on a former tree nursery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of year even if they didn ' t play golf there . Towering pines line the fairways , and white , pink and purple blossoms set off the greenest grass on God ' s green earth . Jarring influences are hunted down and removed : Green plastic bags cover spools of TV cable ; attendants lurk beneath grandstands to pick up paper debris as it hits the ground . From a golfing standpoint , Augusta National is deceptive , the pros say . It ' s a tough place to score well despite broad fairways , few sand traps and rough no longer than the fairways on many courses . The difficulty is mainly in the greens , which are slippery and sloping and must be approached with care . They ' re also tough to read . " I zink they ' re faster than last year , " said defending champion Bernhard Langer of West Germany after a practice round on Wednesday . " I think they ' re slower , " said Tom Watson , the winner in 1977 and ' 81 . " They don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Play it and good luck , ' " comments pro Payne Stewart approvingly . " There ' s a different smell in the air here , a different roar to the crowd , " says Watson . " One thing ' s for sure : You never have to move the beer cans to find your ball.
