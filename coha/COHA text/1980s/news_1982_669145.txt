They all said much the same thing : With interest rates dropping and stock prices rising , the money market mutual funds had better batten down the hatches , because the ' ' great outflow ' ' was coming. // So far , however , there hasn ' t been much of a flow in either direction , and predictions that up to $50 billion of the money funds ' $230 billion assets would leave the funds seem unlikely to come to pass . Part of the reason , fund executives and other financial experts say , is mechanical ; another part is a fundamental change in the way people are saving their money these days. // The funds are taking steps to protect their future , using marketing that puts greater emphasis on services , rather than just high yields . The services include check-writing privileges , telephone redemption , individual retirement accounts , and the ability to switch money from a money fund to a stock fund at investment companies that have both types of funds. // When interest rates started falling , the money funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in times of falling rates : they started buying money market instruments with longer redemption periods . A money fund ' s portfolio is composed of a variety of short-term corporate borrowing notes , bank-issued repurchase agreements ( or ' ' repos ' ' ) and certificates of deposit , and government debt instruments such as US Treasury certificates. // When they make these purchases , the funds can select the length of time they will hold them before redemption . The average redemption period for all of a fund ' s securities is known as its ' ' average maturity . ' ' Earlier this year , average maturities were about 24 to 26 days . Now , maturities are averaging nearly 40 days . Some funds have maturities as long as 67 or 80 days. // Having longer maturities at a time of falling interest rates means the funds can ' ' lock in ' ' the higher interest rates for a few months . This makes them more attractive to investors for a time . Indeed , instead of having their assets fall , some funds see an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than might otherwise be expected. // If interest rates stay down for a long time , however , money fund yields will eventually have to follow . Even if they get below 10 percent , observers say , they should not lose too many shareholders. // ' ' Money market funds are now a permanent part of many investors ' portfolios , ' ' says Allen Sinai , senior vice-president at Data Resources Inc. of Lexington , Mass . ' ' We are now a nation of savers . The 1970s was the spending decade . The ' 80s is the savings decade. ' ' // ' ' Money funds provided an escape route for investors who were watching their savings slip away , ' ' observed William Melton , senior economist and portfolio manager for Investor Diversified Services Cash Management Fund . ' ' Money funds are providing people with a way to get a fair market rate. ' ' // By paying higher yields and offering accounts people could move money in and out of quickly , Mr. Sinai explained , the money funds have helped boost the savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , ' ' households are putting their money in all sorts of savings vehicles , ' ' Mr. Sinai said. // ' ' There are two kinds of money in money market funds , ' ' noted Sumner Abramson , senior vice-president and manager of the investment department at Colonial Management Associates in Boston . ' ' There ' s institutional money and savings money . I don ' t think you ' re going to get any kind of runoff in savings money . . . . American consumers have gotten used to the idea of money market funds as a place to put their savings. ' ' // ' ' I think money market funds are here to stay , ' ' said Norman G. Fosback , president of the Institute for Econometric Research , which rates money funds for safety and tracks other investments . ' ' More money funds are coming on stream almost every day. ' ' // In the past year the number of money funds has increased from 134 to approximately 250 . ' ' While a few of these may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , both the number of funds and their assets will continue to grow. // If the funds do experience a drop in yields , fund managers say , it won ' t be because they lost money to the banks . Should the stock market rally that began this summer be of the long-term variety , some money fund customers may switch part of their money into stock and bond funds. // For the longer term , there are still questions about how much more the money funds can grow . The funds ' $230 billion assets have mushroomed faster than any previous savings or investment vehicle . With lower and more stable returns , people shifting some of their money to stock and bond funds , and some of the institutions - including pension funds and insurance companies - moving some of their ' ' parked ' ' cash out of money funds , these funds may have peaked. // On the other hand , notes Richard Vesely , marketing vice-president for the Delaware Funds , there still aren ' t very many people who have invested in money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' You ' re talking about only 20 percent of the households in the US that have money funds , and that ' s a maximum figure , ' ' he said . ' ' Most accepted figures are closer to 10 percent . Money funds are primarily a Northeastern US , Chicago-area , West Coast phenomenon . A lot of people still confuse them with a bank certificate. ' ' // With increased emphasis on services as well as higher yields , Mr. Vesely says , the funds can continue the pace of rising assets they have enjoyed for the past couple of years. // The possibility that some money fund shareholders might switch assets to stock and bond funds , if those markets appear headed for a long-term upturn , is positively tantalizing to William E. Donoghue , who as publisher of the Money Fund Report , has become closely associated with the money market funds. // ' ' I ' m counting on it , ' ' he says of portential money-to-stock fund switchers . He recently purchased a guide to all the mutual funds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-sales-charge ) mutual funds will be published. // //
