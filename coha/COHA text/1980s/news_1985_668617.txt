In 1908 a Victor 78 rpm recording of Donizetti ' s sextet from " Lucia " with Enrico Caruso cost $7 . That single aria only a few minutes long cost as much as an entire LP costs today . Adjusted for inflation over the past 77 years , that Victor 78 would cost closer to $70 today . Thus , when people lament the price of a compact disc , usually about $14 or $15 , I remind them of what a bargain they ' re receiving . The CD holds 40 to 73 minutes of music with fidelity not even dreamed of in Caruso ' s day . Prices for CDs will eventually level off at about $12 , perhaps by the end of the year . Cardboard packaging might permit some discs to sell for as little as $10 , which is about the same as what some digitally recorded analog LPs currently cost . While the price falls , the selection and quality of CDs improves . Browsing through the bins of a major local record retailer , some amazing discs fell into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago blues singer Big Bill Broonzy recorded in France in 1951 ? Or how about the longest running Broadway musical in history , " The Fantastiks . " Until recently even the LP of that show was out-of-pressing . Listening to an old chestnut like " The Fantastiks " on CD , you can hear all the faults of old recordings . But the CD still sounds better than the LP . Not only does the CD eliminate surface noise , but gone is the horrendous inner-groove distortion caused by trying to cram 50 minutes onto the original LP . While the CD ( Polydor 821 943-2 Y-1 ) may not be fantastic , it won ' t leave you trying to remember what the original sounded like . Now comes a tour de force from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab : The original Woodstock double albums have been remastered for CD . Mobile Fidelity began by pressing audiophile demonstration albums , then moved on to reissuing hot selling but technically ordinary LPs in improved audiophile editions . The company ' s policy is to return to the original master tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has released three stunning boxed sets of painstakingly improved collections of the Beatles , Rolling Stones and Frank Sinatra . The latter two are still available , but the limited-edition Beatles collection was an immediate sell-out . Mobile Fidelity also uses its technology in making audiophile cassettes . Realizing the possibilities of CD for showcasing the sonic glories of even older analog master tapes , Mobile Fidelity took an immediate plunge into the new medium . Unfortunately , the major record labels that must license recordings to Mobile Fidelity are more reluctant to offer CD rights than audiophile LPs . The only Beatle recording in the world available on CD is " Abbey Road , " and that ' s only in Japan . The Mobile Fidelity four disc " Woodstock " set sounds good enough to give any aging hippie deja vu . The Woodstock Festival recordings wouldn ' t seem ideal material for the CD medium . The eight-track analog tapes made without noise reduction under adverse conditions are far from the epitome of state-of-the-art , even for 1969 . The hums , buzzes and " popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s an immediacy to these CDs lacking on the LPs . The crickets and locusts in the background on the first side are so real you begin looking underneath the furniture in your room . Sure , the tape hiss remains , but the voices project more cleanly with greater realism . While you can ' t live the summer of ' 69 over , these CDs provide more than a nostalgic reminiscence . A special offer comes with the boxed set . For an additional $4 you can send in for an authorized , limited edition reprint of the original " Woodstock " program book , which as Mobile Fidelity notes , many of the original attendees never received . One further technical note concerning these Mobile Fidelity CDs . They are the first American release using Sanyo ' s new HR ( High Reliability ) technology . Both sides of the discs receive a thin coating of plastic resin providing additional protection against scratching and warping . Sanyo claims this technology proves ideal for discs played on portables and in the car . Meanwhile at the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recordings specifically for the medium . " Time Warp " ( CD-80106 ) picks up where " Star Tracks " left off . " Time Warp " is a two-decade retrospective of science fiction film scores , plus original synthesizer music commissioned for this disc . Producer Bob Woods and engineer Jack Renner have outdone themselves on stretching the technical extremes of the CD medium . The music , performed by Eric Kunzel directing the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra ( the same forces who performed the famous Telarc " 1812 Overture " recording ) includes the " Star Trek " and " Star Wars " themes , plus the opening of Strauss ' " Also Sprach Zarathustra " better known as the theme from the film " 2001.
