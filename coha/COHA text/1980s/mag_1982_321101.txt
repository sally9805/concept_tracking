THE DEAN 'S DECEMBER ; By Saul Bellow ; Harper &; Row ; 312 pages ; $13.95 <P> At its richest , Saul Bellow 's freestyle prose reads as if a Division Street Dostoyevsky were writing a book called Thus Spake the Nobel Savage . In Mr. Sammler 's Planet ( 1970 ) , the author 's tone took a Spenglerian edge as the novel 's elderly New Yorker ruminated on the decline of the West Side and , inferentially , civilization as the author knows and reveres it . Sammler had political repercussions . Bellow was accused of being aloof , insensitive and a neoconservative . He has calmly and disdainfully rejected these labels as simplistic . <P> Any suggestion that the 1976 Nobel prizewinner was intimidated by his critics is dispelled in The Dean 's December , a work that opens a second front in Bellow 's war on cultural and intellectual nihilism . The scenes are set almost exclusively in Chicago and Bucharest , a disparity underscored by the line , " There was nothing too rum to be true . " In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist and his wife made to Rumania a few years ago to visit her dying mother . <P> The literary result is Albert Corde , the latest and best of Bellow 's old cogitators . Corde , a Chicago college dean , spends a great deal of time in an underheated Bucharest apartment waiting for his mother-in-law to die in a state hospital and mulling over the retreat of " personal humanity " before " the worldwide process of consolidation . " The woman was an eminent psychiatrist and former Minister of Health whose humanism was incompatible with the Communist regime . Corde 's wife Minna is an astrophysicist who defected to the U.S. and must now beg a vindictive bureaucracy for permission to see her failing mother . <P> The dean , a " hungry observer , " describes the bleak utilitarianism and pinched daily life in the old Eastern European capital . Earthquake damage is crudely patched if repaired at all ; the public crematorium is a factory where the dead are reduced unceremoniously to convenient size ; his wife 's childhood home , once a center of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenement : " Radiators turned cold after breakfast . The faucets went dry at 8 a.m. and did not run again until evening . The bathtub had no stopper . You flushed the toilet with buckets of water . " <P> These are not cheap shots aimed to cripple Rumania 's tourist industry or elicit smug agreement about Communist inefficiency . Corde has seen worse in Chicago . He has , in fact , written about it with appalling accuracy for Harper 's magazine and caused a flap . The dean has also been criticized for his role in the arrest of two blacks accused of murder . Corde has been called a racist , a traitor to his home town and a fool . His boss is miffed at the publicity caused by his magazine piece , and his boyhood friend Dewey Spangler , now a famous columnist and " princely communicator , " complains that Corde put too much poetry into Chicago .
