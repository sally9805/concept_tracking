Aquino is buried amid outpourings of mourning and militancy <P> For days , hundreds of thousands of mourners had filed past his glass-covered coffin in suburban Manila . Countless tears had been shed ; calls for insurrection had been voiced . Finally , there were only simple things left to say over the body of the murdered folk hero before it was laid to rest . Jaime Cardinal Sin , Archbishop of Manila , knew that well as he stood in front of a quiet crowd of mourners in the Quezon City Church of Santo Domingo . The prelate gazed upon the remains of Philippine Opposition Leader Benigno ( " Ninoy " ) Aquino Jr. , and announced the theme of the funeral oration that would be carried across his troubled nation . It was a single word : " Peace ! " <P> Sin 's invocation was first of all a prayer for the soul of the bloodied corpse before him : the earthly remains of the country 's most famous and charismatic opponent-in-exile of the authoritarian rule of visibly ailing President Ferdinand Marcos , 65 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strongman declared martial law in 1972 , Aquino spent 7A years in Philippine jails on charges of murder , illegal possession of firearms and subversion , and three more years of exile in the U.S. Ignoring innumerable threats and an official death sentence against him , Aquino returned home on Aug. 21 . Within 30 seconds of his arrival at Manila International Airport , he was murdered by a single shot from an assassin 's .357 Magnum revolver . <P> Sin 's funeral refrain was also intended as a call for reconciliation in the populous ( 53 million ) Philippines , which may face its worst political crisis in decades because of Aquino 's murder . The assassination seared the country 's consciousness and may have dealt a mortal blow to the idea of a nonviolent and nonmilitary succession in the Philippines after Marcos . The prospect of upheaval , in turn , threatens vital U.S. interests in the strategic islands . <P> Few Filipinos were yet concerned with the broader consequences of the Cardinal 's plea for social peace . Their concern was with Aquino . Nonetheless , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowds respected the Aquino family 's wish for a relatively private funeral . Among the nonfamily members present at the service were officials of the U.S. ( Ambassador Michael Armacost ) , Japan , Canada , Australia and the European Community , which sent representatives despite the Philippine foreign ministry 's disapproval . No one from the Marcos regime came to the funeral . <P> <P> After the ceremonies were over , Aquino 's plain wooden coffin , draped with the Philippine national flag , was carried out of the church by 16 pallbearers amid cheers and chants of " Ninoy . Ninoy . " When the coffin was placed atop the flower-bedecked platform of a flatbed truck , a crowd that had gathered before dawn went wild . Police estimated that , despite torrential rains , more than 1 million people had gathered along the 19-mile route between the Santo Domingo Church and the Manila Memorial Park cemetery .
