A case of mistaken identity <P> It started out like a routine call . Police in Columbus received a tip that a man was loitering outside a north-side town house . When the officers arrived , the intruder was inside with a ski mask and an array of burglary tools . Arrested was an improbable suspect : Dr. Edward Jackson , 38 , a prominent local internist . The case be came even more improbable after the police searched Jackson 's car . There they found a long list of rape victims , leading them to believe that Jackson was the " Grandville rapist , " suspected of nearly 100 assaults in that affluent neighbor hood .

The resemblance between the two men , who are not related , is indeed striking : both are tall , slender blacks with short Afros , sparse beards , mustaches and similar facial features . <P> William Jackson was released from prison 7 hours after Edward Jackson was indicted .

I spent five years down there , and all they said was ' We 're sorry . ' "
