On April 21 , Mrs. Smith , 68 years old , who is almost completely paralyzed , was able to respond to simple yes and no questions by clenching her hand . She informed her doctor and officials from the Food and Drug Administration that the day before she became ill she had eaten canned salmon. // The questions were not idle guesswork . They were based on an incident that had occurred two and a half months earlier in Europe . A 27-year-old Belgian , Eric Mathay , died of botulism on Feb. 7 after eating a pate made by his wife from a can of salmon imported from the United States . His wife became ill too , but survived. // The incident in Belgium started a series of events that has kept various health agencies on the trail of millions of cans of salmon all over the world . It has led to the second largest recall of canned foods in history and sent teams of Food and Drug Administration officials to Alaska in search of faulty canning equipment . It has involved officials from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control in Atlanta , who have sought proof that Mrs. Smith does indeed have botulism ( laboratory tests have so far been inconclusive ) . // And it has wreaked havoc with the American salmon industry . The Food and Drug Administration has initiated eight separate recalls in the United States involving 55 million 7 3/4-ounce cans of salmon . Shipments of American canned salmon have been stopped in several other countries . Only the removal of 75 million cans of mushrooms from store shelves in 1973 and 1974 , also because of botulism contamination , was larger than the salmon recall. // Though botulism poisoning is infrequent - and most cases are the result of home canning - it can be deadly . The entire population of the world could be killed with a pint of the toxin , according to some scientists . It is particularly dangerous because it is odorless and colorless and can not be detected without laboratory tests. // Two days before Mr. Mathay died , the F.D.A. was notified that he and <> <> Safety tips on home canning are on page C6. <> his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The identifying code markings on the can of salmon in question were sent to Washington and then on to the F.D.A. ' s office in Seattle , which was able to establish that the salmon had been packed on July 24 , 1980 , on the first shift at a cannery in Ketchikan , Alaska . All packaged food in the United States carries such codes . The distributor , John West , an English company , reported that shipments of that particular lot went not only to Belgium but also to the Netherlands and South Africa . The company recalled all the cans. // The can that caused Mr. Mathay ' s death contained a " small , punched-in black spot and tiny hole , " according to F.D.A. officials . Within a week officials in England , aware of the recall , discovered another can with a similar defect . It had a different code , which meant that the problem was not confined to a single lot , not even a single canner , but to several canners. // Not until 10 days after the botulism incident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Salmon canning is a seasonal business , operating at most for the three summer months . The rest of the year the canneries are shut down . In the plant , F.D.A. investigators discovered that a machine that reshapes flattened cans ( many cans are flat when they are shipped to Alaskan canneries ) was accidentally causing the puncture. // Ordinarily , botulism toxins can not grow in the presence of oxygen . F.D.A. scientists theorize that the botulinus spores , which are harmless , entered the can through the hole after the can had been pressure cooked and sterilized . Then , the scientists believe , either a piece of salmon re-sealed the hole or the oil in which the salmon was packed cut off the organisms ' oxygen supply , producing an anaerobic , or oxygen-free , environment. // In nearly all previous cases of botulism poisoning , the toxin resulted from the failure to destroy spores in the canning process . On Feb. 18 , the Food and Drug Administration advised the public to return to the stores any 7 3/4-ounce can of salmon that contained " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the can lid . That recall was followed on March 19 by an announcement of recalls of additional codes ; a third announcement was made March 31 and a fourth April 8 . In all , cans from eight packing companies were involved. // So far , 30 defective cans have been discovered in the United States ; several have been located abroad . The only can with confirmed botulism toxins , however , is the one that caused the death in Belgium. // The F.D.A. says it does not expect additional recalls , but in some parts of the country officials have taken further steps because of the confusion caused by the multiple recalls and the large number of canners involved . Residents of Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Mexico , Vermont and New York City have been advised not to eat salmon from any 7 3/4-ounce cans. // There have been no problems with 3 3/4- or 15-ounce cans of salmon , but the recalls and warnings have had a devastating effect on the canned salmon industry and are expected to have a serious impact in Alaska , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Reaction abroad was more dramatic than it was in the United States . The defective cans , under the John West label , had been distributed in England , the Netherlands and South Africa as well as Belgium . All four countries have stopped importing 7 3/4-ounce cans of salmon from the United States . Since then , Australia has followed suit. // The Alaska canned salmon industry , already reeling from an oversupply of the product because of high prices , is concerned . Britain purchases 20 to 25 percent of the yearly Alaska canned salmon output. // In the United States , the first recall did not appear to have a significant impact on sales . But industry officials say they believe the continued recalls have undermined public confidence . They agreed to take responsibility , with help from the National Food Processors Association , for checking all 1980 and 1981 salmon packs in warehouse storage. // In a letter dated March 1 , Joseph Hile , the F.D.A. ' s associate commissioner for regulatory affairs , suggested that the industry consider a one-time withdrawal of all 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very likely would cause massive confusion at the retail and consumer level. " // Mr. Hile said a single temporary withdrawal of all 7 3/4-ounce cans " would avoid permanent damage to the reputation of your industry . " Since only eight of 58 Alaskan canneries were involved in the recall ( none of the 14 continental United States canners were involved ) , the majority of canners did not feel that they should be required to spend millions of dollars recalling what they said were sound products . R.P. Farrow of the National Food Processors Association rejected the F.D.A. ' s suggestion , saying that a total recall " would have a devastating long-term impact on the industry. " // In view of the Connecticut case , several industry spokesmen now admit that it might have been better from a public relations standpoint to have followed the F.D.A. ' s advice . Since the Smith case was reported , sales of all canned salmon have dropped 50 percent , according to the industry . Others say sales are at a standstill. // It will be impossible to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long since been discarded by the time the diagnosis of botulism was made . But Mrs. Smith indicated to F.D.A. inspectors that the salmon she ate was from a company that has been forced to recall its 7 3/4-ounce cans of salmon . In addition , there were two cans of the same brand of salmon in her house , but they were untainted. // Because it remains unresolved , her case is frustrating to the industry , according to Ron Jensen , an executive with the seafood division of Castle &; Cooke , a large food producer . " It ' s ruining the industry , " he said . " I wish it would be resolved one way or another. " // Patricia Checko , an epidemiologist with the Connecticut State Department of Health Services , says she is certain that Mrs. Smith has botulism . " We believe that clinically the woman has a syndrome that is compatible with botulism , said Miss Checko said " The way she is responding to therapy , is compatible with botulism. " // In addition to the 1974 recall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scares , but there have been only two confirmed deaths in this country from commercially canned food in the last 11 years . Probably the best known occurred in 1971 when a Bedford , N.Y. , man died after eating a can of Bon Vivant vichysoisse . The company eventually filed for bankruptcy. // The canned salmon industry is afraid that many canners , especially the smaller ones , will be forced out of business . Salmon officials note the industry ' s long record of safety and its quality control methods . But the Food and Drug Administration does not agree . According to Chris Smith , an agency spokesman , the industry ' s quality control is uneven because of the cyclical nature of the business . And the recall , he added , has been " very difficult because the industry keeps very poor records. " // These events are expected to have serious ramifications for Alaska and its $300 million salmon industry . Warehouses are crowded with 20 percent of the 1980 canned salmon output and 60 percent or more of the 1981 output. // To compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning in June . Without the profits from the sale of the previous years ' supply , the canners do not have the money they need to buy the salmon from fishermen , and high interest rates make borrowing more difficult . The state has been asked to provide low-interest loans to canners so they can buy this year ' s catch , and negotiations are under way to sell much of the 1980 and 1981 supply to South Korea. //
