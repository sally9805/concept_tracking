One product is recalled <P> Ever since they were introduced more than 40 years ago , tampons have been a liberating force for women , allowing them to wear more revealing clothing , to participate in such sports as swimming and generally to act more freely during menstruation . Now these products , used by 50 million women , have been linked to a sometimes fatal disorder called toxic-shock syndrome ( TSS ) . Last week one of the more popular brands , Procter &; Gamble 's Rely , was recalled from the market . and the Food and Drug Administration issued a strong warning against its use . <P> First identified in Colorado two years ago , TSS is caused by an agent of the common Staphylococcus aureus bacterium , often found in abscesses . Since January the U.S. Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has recorded 344 cases , including 28 deaths . All but 16 of the cases involved menstruating women , usually under 30 years old . Suspicions were directed toward Rely after a study of 42 TSS patients showed that the brand had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial signs include high fever , diarrhea , vomiting and dizziness , followed by a sunburn-like rash with peeling of skin , especially on the hands and feet . There may also be a sharp drop in blood pressure and , in severe cases , fatal shock . The bacterium may be carried into the vagina during insertion of the absorbent pluglike devices . Rely may be doing its job all too well . It may be creating an ideal breeding ground for the staph bacterium . <P> Procter &; Gamble insists that the case against its six-year-old product is far from proved . Says a company medical consultant : " Can you imagine a Government agency passing up the opportunity to scare the hell out of millions of women ? " Even so , the Cincinnati-based firm ordered the product off the market , offering refunds to customers . That may not be enough . One TSS victim , Linda Imboden of Redding , Calif. , who lost her hair and suffered crippling in her hands and toes , has already filed a $5 million suit against Procter &; Gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous . The company denies the charge . <P> To reduce the risk , federal health officials are suggesting that women not use tampons or use them only intermittently . Women may substitute sanitary napkins or washable natural sponges . If a woman suspects she has the disorder , she should stop using tampons and consult a doctor . Antibiotics to control the infection and fluids to reverse the effects of dehydration are the most crucial therapy . If treated early , most victims recover completely with no lasting disability .
