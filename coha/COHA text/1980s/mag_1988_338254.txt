Money may be the root of all evil , but the PTL ministry needs cash anyway . Last week , as the church faced possible liquidation of assets in bankruptcy proceedings , PTL was fielding offers for its 2,200-acre Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill , S.C . Among half a dozen potential buyers of the park , appraised at $200 million by PTL last year , was George Shinn , 47 , a multimillionaire who owns minor-league baseball and basketball teams . Shinn is thinking of building a baseball stadium at Heritage USA , parts of which have been closed since September , and moving his Charlotte Knights from North Carolina . <P> The PTL empire has been crumbling since Televangelist Jim Bakker left the pulpit in March 1987 after admitting to a one-night stand with Church Secretary Jessica Hahn . As donations dried up , PTL sank , at least $75 million in debt .
