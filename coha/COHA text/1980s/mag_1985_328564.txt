The author is a sometime trucker who , for the past seven years , has been using a three-quarter-ton pickup to deliver honey from her bee farm to retailers around the country . She sleeps in truck stops because they are safe and coffee is always available . <P> In the early morning there is a city of the mind that stretches from coast to coast , from border to border . Its cross streets are the interstate highways , and food , comfort , companionship are served up in its buildings , the truck stops near the exits . Its citizens are all-night drivers , the truckers and the waitresses at the stops . In daylight the city fades and blurs when the transients appear , tourists who merely want a meal and a tank of gas . They file into the carpeted dining rooms away from the professional drivers ' side , sit at the Formica tables set off by imitation cloth flowers in bud vases . They eat and are gone , do not return . They are not a part of the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck stop in West Virginia . Drivers in twos , threes and fours are eating breakfast and talking routes and schedules . <P> " Truckers ! " growls a manager . " They say they are in a hurry . They complain if the service is n't fast . We fix it so they can have their fuel pumped while they are eating and put in telephones on every table so they can check with their dispatch- ers . They could be out of here in half an hour . But what do they do ? They sit and talk for two hours . " <P> The truckers are lining up for seconds at the breakfast buffet ( all you can eat for $3.99  --  biscuits with chipped-beef gravy , fruit cup , French toast with syrup , bacon , pancakes , sausage , scrambled eggs , doughnuts , Danish , cereal in little boxes ) . <P> The travel store at the truck stop has a machine to measure heartbeat in exchange for a quarter . There are racks of jackets , belts , truck supplies , tape cassettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with likenesses of John Wayne or a stag . The rack by the cash register is stuffed with Twinkies and chocolate Suzy Qs . <P> It is 5 a.m. in New Mexico . Above the horseshoe-shaped counter on panels where a menu is usually displayed , an overhead slide show is in progress . The pictures change slowly , allowing the viewer to take in all the details . A low shot of a Peterbilt , its chrome fittings sparkling in the sunshine , is followed by one of a bosomy young woman , the same who must pose for those calendars found in auto-parts stores . She almost has on clothes , and she is offering to check a trucker 's oil . The next slide is a side view of a whole tractor-trailer rig , its 18 wheels gleaming and spoked . It is followed by one of a blond bulging out of a hint of cop clothes writing a naughty trucker a ticket . <P> The waitress looks too tired and too jaded to be offended . The jaws of the truckers move mechanically as they fork up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed , as intent on chrome as on flesh . <P> It is 4 a.m. in Oklahoma . A recycled Stuckey 's with blue tile roof calls itself simply Truck Stop . The sign also boasts showers , scales , truck wash and a special on service for $88.50 . At a table inside , four truckers have ordered a short stack and three eggs apiece , along with bacon , sausage and coffee ( Trucker 's Superbreakfast  --  $3.79 ) .
