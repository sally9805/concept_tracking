After their defeat , the Communists sell out for Cabinet posts <P> The unsettling news reached the U.S. Vice President on the eve of his scheduled talk with President Franois Mitterrand in Paris . In the full flush of his sweeping victory , which gave the Socialists control of the National Assembly , Mitterrand had decided to appoint four Communists to his 44-member Cabinet . When George Bush emerged last week from a three-hour luncheon meeting with Mitterrand at the Elyse Palace , he read , with the restrained air of a guest who felt obliged to chastise his host , a brief statement to reporters : " The position of the United States on the subject of Communist participation in the governments of our allies is well known . This participation is bound to cause concern . " <P> Standing at Bush 's side , looking slightly fatigued but as tranquil as ever , Mitterrand pointedly reasserted Paris ' traditional independence from Washington . Sounding much like his old rival Charles de Gaulle , the Socialist President declared : " France 's policy is that of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe his country as " a faithful and loyal ally of the United States . " <P> The State Department followed up that gentlemanly exchange with a brusque warning that " the tone and content of our relationship as allies will be affected by the inclusion of Communists " in the Mitterrand government . For all their public protestations of injured innocence , French officials admitted privately that Washington 's wrist slap had not been unexpected . For the first time in 34 years , the Communist Party had been called to share national power in France . Not since the earliest postwar reconstruction days , in fact , had the government of such a key Western European country included Communist ministers. * <P> Washington 's caveat reflected a two-fold concern : 1 ) that the French precedent might be emulated in other , less stable European countries with large Communist parties , especially Italy , Spain and Portugal ; and 2 ) that Western defense secrets might be compromised by a Communist presence in an allied government . One Administration official said privately that the U.S. would now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French authorities protect Atlantic Alliance secrets before it passes new defense information on to the Mitterrand government . <P> Those fears found a restrained echo in other Western capitals , but most allied leaders sought to muffle the alarm bells . Cautioned West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt : " It 's not an infectious disease . I do n't think one should dramatize it . " <P> To soothe allied jitters , French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson noted that the four ministries under Communist control had nothing whatsoever to do with defense . ( In fact , the Communist-controlled transportation ministry does coordinate troop mobilizations and has access to certain NATO information concerning joint military transport . ) The strong U.S. reaction , the Foreign Minister added , played up to American public opinion : " ' Reds in government ' - that is how people in the Midwest envision the new French government .
