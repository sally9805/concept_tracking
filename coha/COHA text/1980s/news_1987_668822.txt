Chicago Cubs announcer Steve Stone fired up a cigar the size of a railroad tie and offered sage counsel to a busher . ( That ' s baseball jargon for the pretenders , for those who venture where they probably don ' t belong . ) " Stick with phrases like ' past history ' or ' he came to play , ' " the announcer said with a grin . " It ' ll be the making of your broadcast career . " Stone ' s assignment for WGN-TV and the Cubs this spring has been to shepherd a platoon of rank amateurs through an afternoon ( no lights in Wrigley Field ) of baseball broadcasting while the redoubtable Harry Caray was taking the waters in Palm Springs , recuperating from a mild stroke . The endeavor , which should end upon Caray ' s scheduled return to work May 19 , has brought such luminaries as actor Bill Murray , pundit George Will , Cubs legend Ernie Banks , columnist Mike Royko and a host of genuine baseball announcers from other franchises into the Cubs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Waves , your present hero was penciled into this cacophonous pantheon . Looking for this unlikely grab at the Main Chance as a stunt worthy of George Plimpton and an experiment in broadcasting terror , it took me several seconds to consent . A few scheduling problems ensued , and the flight plans of some major motion-picture stars pushed my appearance back , much to the delight of my low companions . " Never happen , " I was assured more than twice . " No way they ' d ever let you do a Cubs game . I mean , Bill Murray was in ' Meatballs . ' " But they did . Sunday , May 3 , perhaps the coldest afternoon since a young Bill Veeck strung the ivy on the walls at Addison and Clark . Imbued with baseball fever , mumbling diamond cliches , resplendent in an argyle sweater and trenchcoat , I treated myself to a cab ride to Wrigley Field . The trip was uneventful , save for the look on the driver ' s face as he overheard his fare stage-whisper phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fourth inning , ' and ' You got ta like this youngster , Steve . He reminds me of a young Ken Reitz . ' Or cliches to that effect . My partner was on hand when I stumbled into the Cubs offices , clutching a handful of press guides , a scorecard and crib notes scribbled on cocktail napkins emblazoned with the names of low haunts where I had calmed my nerves Saturday night . The unflappable Stone was flapping . " Two words , " he said . " ' Rain delay . ' What do we talk about for an hour or so if it starts raining ? " Outside , the sky was the color of the Eisenhower Expressway , and great bundles of fog were rolling in over the scoreboard . Two hours to game time . I expressed the institutional confidence of the United States Weather Service that no rain was imminent . I knew , however , that a protracted rain delay in my stammering company would cause Stone massive psychic distress . I also knew I could just leave town when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeseburger , no onions , I began accumulating the mountain of baseball minutiae that accompanies each broadcast : Pitcher Rick Sutcliffe has a lifetime record of 6 and 5 against the San Diego Padres . Leon Durham owns a career batting average of over . 400 against Andy Hawkins , the Padres ' pitcher on this arctic afternoon . Andre Dawson was the National League ' s Player of the Week and is third in the league in runs batted in . I watched Stone break out the Magic Marker , highlighting lies , damn lies and statistics . As I discovered to my sorrow , it seems a futile exercise until that moment when the ball begins rolling through the outfield , runners start careening around the bases and your job is to muster some pertinent remarks about these unfolding events . Then again , I learned that the perfect gem of printed information ferreted out for the opportune moment has a tendency to disappear like socks in a clothes dryer . " It was right here , " I groused between innings . " Ryne Sandberg ' s batting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s right here . " But while I was talking , and looking , and equivocating , WGN was selling cars . The moment was gone , and so was Ryne Sandberg . " Watch me , " Stone offered . " Wait for the end of the sentence , the end of the thought , then jump in . If I want you to say something , I ' ll give you a tap on the arm . You ' ll do fine . Nothing to it . " It was the first lie but a reassuring conceit . As my body temperature dropped and my palms strained to sweat in the 45- degree air , I heard someone singing the national anthem . Arne Harris , the man in the production truck for WGN , was whispering in my ear : " You ' ll be fine , kid . " Anticipation became reality , and the job of every blathering weekend weatherman in television suddenly looked harder . " There aren ' t any erasers on this microphone , " Stone said with that smile and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deal cut with Stone had me functioning as a " color man " for the first two innings , with a play-by-play stint available in the third . In a trice , Sutcliffe had struck out a batter , and in my ear Harris yelped that the replay was coming . Say something pithy , wise guy . Stone made a twisting notion with his right hand , and I heard myself talking about a curve ball , low and away . Harris rolled the tape again and Stone , sensing an end to my conventional wisdom , jumped in to fill the silence . In the early going the most disconcerting moments came in pairs . My Celtic mug  --  a face made for radio  --  kept showing up on the screen . Every time it happened I felt like I had stumbled into the Fun House . Who ' s the clown sitting next to Steve Stone ? And I began to suffer curious lapses of memory . Live television seems to induce what a friend of mine calls " brain cramps . " For example : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity you know well . Say , Cubs left fielder Chico Walker . Walker moves in the direction of the ball , and in the unforgiving minute his name becomes as hard to locate as an English-speaking cabdriver . " Chico Walker makes the catch in left , " I hear Stone saying . Joe Cornejo , Harris ' aide-de-camp in the booth , is another TV lifer dedicated to making the interloper look good . " When someone hits a double or a triple or a home run , " Cornejo tells me , " I ' ll hand you a slip of paper with a number on it . That ' s the number of doubles or home runs or whatever for the player . I tell you , and you tell them , right away . " For a novice broadcaster , this is the greatest trick since tax deductions . Instant wisdom , and it ' s delivered like pizza . When I found myself calling a seventh-inning home run by the Cubs ' Andre Dawson , I looked down to find that slip of paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering the boyhood calls of announcers like Mel Allen , Red Barber , Jack Brickhouse , Pittsburgh ' s Bob Prince and Harry Caray . By the way , I refrained from all " Holy Cows " and other broadcast signature tunes , though not for lack of trying . In the middle three innings I worked the radio booth with Lou Boudreau and color man Jim Frey . Frey had managed the Cubs to a divisional title in 1984 , my last year as a sports columnist . I numbered him among the funniest men alive , though certain Federal Communications Commission restrictions involving runaway adjectives inhibit his insouciance . " We ' ll have a little fun , " Frey had said over a cup of coffee . " When you get in the radio booth , I ' ll tell the listeners I ' ve been waiting for you . All those dumb questions you used to ask me about why I didn ' t have the players bunt more . " I laughed and stared down at my boots , not entirely sure Frey was kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . " Let ' s hear some analysis , " Frey growled as I settled into the booth . " You sure acted like you knew a lot about the game when I was managing . " " This is fun , Jimmy , " I offered . " I get to talk baseball with you , but I don ' t have to write down everything you say . " Frey was giggling , and somewhere beyond my microphone the Cubs were beating the Padres ; 27 , 202 zealots were sitting in paid-for seats . The cold would not come off with a wire brush , and Lou Boudreau kept talking about balls and strikes . " On television you stay with the pictures , " a friend in the sports- announcing trade had told me . " You have to talk between the pictures . If you ' ve got a story , telescope it , cut it down as much as possible , or you ' ll run right into a commercial . " It ' s different on the radio . Better for the story-tellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hit the ball . It ' s radio . Who ' s going to call you a liar ? " I maneuvered the Cubs and the Padres through the sixth inning without incident and returned to the TV booth . The seventh was a play-by-play inning for the busher , and the ridiculous temperature had muted all desire for unnecessary chatter . As a trained observer I noted that while I had lost most of the feeling in my fingers and toes , Stone was perspiring . He wasn ' t quite green , but the color was in there . Baseball commenced , and with a reassuring pat , Stone stood up and stepped away from his chair . Suddenly , I was in a movie . The passenger in the small plane is flying into a busy airport at rush hour , the engine is sputtering , the wind is howling and the guy on the ground , usually William Holden , is talking him down . Behind me , silently and with great dignity , my partner was being sick . " Keep talking , kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nodded , and I plunged on . At just that moment , the demons of television and baseball conspired to present me with a San Diego base-running gaffe of dazzling and dizzying proportions . " Here ' s the replay , " I screeched . " It looks like he missed the bag at second . Yeah , he missed the bag at second . There he is , missing the bag at second . You can see it , right there . He missed the bag at second . " The jabbering ended as Lou Boudreau lumbered in from the radio side and began doing those things real announcers do . Cubs ' pitcher Rick Sutcliffe was straining for the finish line , and so was I. Quickly , then , it was over . Cubs 4 , Padres 2 . Some postgame wisdom was required , but my day was done . I hunkered in the press room and waited for the reviews . In this situation , I reckoned , people will always be kind . I felt like the Flying Wallendas on a day when Niagara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For everyone else it was another day at the office . The next afternoon , Stone and his 102-degree fever would be back on the stand , again aiding the broadcasting infirm . He is part of a diminishing circle of humanity , the segment that believes no one is enhanced by the embarrassment of others . It ' s an endearing quality in an announcer or in anyone else . As for me , I figure there ' s not much left . I ' ve been to a cock fight , had drinks with Howard Cosell and survived three years in California . What else can you show me ? The day after the game , a friendly general manager at a local TV station called me up to read me my Nielsen ratings for Sunday . He came away impressed . Hey , he ' s got million-dollar anchors hard at work with ratings numbers half my size . Sure , the Cubs get some credit , and it wasn ' t much of a day to take the kids to the zoo , but aside from calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forgetting Chico what ' s-his-name , it wasn ' t so bad . Got a handshake from Lou Boudreau and small head cold from exposure and this review of my postgame analysis from a friend : " You looked like you wanted to toss the microphone and run to the bathroom . " This much is certain . Given another chance , I ' d do much better . Much better . Considerably better . No doubt in my mind . . . .
