main structure . The house was established on a small rise , and was surrounded by flowering bushes and climbing vines . Oliphant thought it a pastoral dream . It was less imposing than the Beaufort cottages , but seemed to him more of-the-earth and substantial . The breeze shook the Spanish moss hanging from the backdrop of live oaks , making the house appear especially well anchored and still in a swimming landscape . A school of people animated the scene then , alerted by the approach of Talbird Royall 's trotter . They burst off the front porch and from the out-buildings , black and white faces , adults and children , hollering and gasping with grand expectancy . Narcissa descended the sloping walkway to the carriage drive turn below the house . She wore a long blue smock over a pale green muslin dress  --  fancied up for company , but practical too , her dark hair pinned up with mother of pearl combs . A large loop of keys flapped at her hip , and she carried a straw basket of cut herbs under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . The mud on her hem showed that she had been at work in and out of doors . She waved hello with her left arm , extending her body forward . Thus distracted , she tripped on a plantation dog that was yapping at the invasion of Talbird 's dog . She saved her balance by reaching out her right hand to catch Talbird 's leg above her , but this action scattered the herbs to the ground . She recovered with a take-life-easy shrug , laughed at herself , and stooped to collect the herbs . It was then , at this his second encounter of Narcissa Royall , that Oliphant felt himself captured as if magically  --  spellbound !  --  by this handsome , graceful , diligent , independent , and splendiferous woman . Indigo Reach was hers , and hers entirely , to feed , repair , plant , harvest , doctor , and enrich . Oliphant saw a woman , just past 30 , whose force of will held all that she was and had in cultivation and civilization in a wetland that could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to honor , to venerate , to come home to , to be buried by . It was not love that he felt for her then ; it was more an adoration of the feminine in this one beautiful woman . There was desire too . Narcissa had a fuller shape than Camellia 's , and was less fashionably pretty ; but her body was as commanding as the fertility of the earth , with nearly a decade behind her of managing babies , soil , crops , people and their fates . That day , as soon as Oliphant climbed down from the barouche to help Narcissa pick up the herbs , he felt his need to be near her and to remain near her . It overcame him and captured him and propelled him to kneel on one knee beside her and scramble for cloves among thep251excited hounds . He was happy . The Royalls gave him the greatest pleasure he had ever known . Oliphant spoke , " Mrs. Winwood , this is lovely , lovely . " " You like my home , Cousin ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . " Oliphant stood , and held out the herbs he had gathered . Narcissa moved toward him , but then Camellia was in her arms . The two of them spun around in glee , halloing and kissing . In their dance , they bumped against Oliphant . He could feel their heat and passion . These were two dazzling females from some vision he had read of , perhaps in the Bible , perhaps in verse . He felt transformed for being part of such an occasion . He felt possessed by their bountiful hearts . The whole family surrounded them then , Narcissa hugging her father and embracing Talbird , Sally , and the baby ; Mrs. Royall and her twins intertwiningthemselves in the group in order to greet Narcissa 's two daughters ; Camellia moving from niece to nephew to kiss them wetly and laugh . Oliphant had no opportunity to escape this circle of parents , siblings , and offspring . Still , his Puritan heart could not directly participate . He stood by , hands at his sides , feeling his need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squealing settled to a general chatter , and Narcissa grabbed Oliphant by one arm while Camellia took him by the other . Narcissa said , " Surprise upon surprise for you , Cousin . You do like my home ? I spy it in you , phosphorescent man ! " Camellia said , " He 'll glow less when we cool him with drink ! " Oliphant started , " Lovely , lovely  --  " but was unable to continue , because Narcissa and Camellia were hurrying him up the slope toward the house . They actually seemed to lift him a little , even as the breeze lifted the smell of jasmine and the salty air and parted the Spanish moss like a veil . Oliphant tried again to speak , and laughed instead . Camellia teased Oliphant for his sudden inarticulate giddiness . " He does sweet-talk without end , for a Yankee , does n't he , Sister ? " Narcissa said , " Dear man , he acts kidnapped . And perhaps he is . We shall be true to the pirate rage . Hold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of us brigands were born . And what surprises we have to turn the head of this handsomest of captives . " Narcissa 's surprises were several , and arranged to follow head upon tail of each other . They were to be a large demonstration of a homey dictump252that she offered Oliphant as he surveyed her domain : " Proper place , Cousin , and proper time , and proper use , that is how one finds errors in their infancy and routine in chaos . " Oliphant jested that he had not heard a ship captain or a bank teller put it better . Narcissa jangled her keys in reflection , and slowly came to understand that he meant to compliment her . Her mind was already in motion toward the first surprise  --  the welcoming meal that night , of turtle soup , oysters , pies of ham and shrimp , cabbage , boiled mutton , roast turkey , pots of buttered rice , fruit , and cakes , which was followed with a general removal to a table set on the back verandah to watch the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped from Granby Royall 's traveling case of Madeira and sherry , the Negro menfolk gathered by torchlight with their dogs and set off into the pine hollows on a possum hunt . The dogs howled in the distant chase . The children screeched nearby in anticipation . One Negro child especially came to Oliphant 's attention Jimmie , the 5-year-old grandson of Narcissa 's chief house servant , Maum Rosemary . Jimmie was fascinated with Oliphant 's clothes and manner , and was soon imitating the way he stood , sat , and gestured . Jimmie even found a cedar stick to match Oliphant 's walking cane , and made a paper hat that resembled Oliphant 's French floppy-brimmed one . Oliphant was charmed by the attention and presented Jimmie with a clay pipe from the set he had bought in Charleston . It was Jimmie who awakened Oliphant early Saturday morning . He had come into the room to watch Oliphant sleep , and made a noise inadvertently while inspecting Oliphant 's boots . After breakfast , Oliphant set out with Jimmie  --  with Maum Rosemary 's permission ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the plantation grounds . Oliphant found the barns well stocked , the ginhouse orderly , the livestock neatly divided into hog , chicken , goat , and horse pens . Narcissa 's February-planted gardens were already rich . Oliphant also found that Jimmie did not care to go down to the slave quarters . Jimmie lived in the big house with his two sisters and Narcissa 's two daughters , Sophy and Martha . He was obviously wary of approaching the other Negro children without his grandmother 's approval . He did take Oliphant to a good vantage , however , so that from a distance Oliphant could see the slave quarters spread out in a dell of pine and chinaberry trees . There were several approximately twenty-foot-square tabby and cedar cabins , rude and whitewashed , all smoke-draped with thep253morning cooking fires . Oliphant wanted to see more , yet , uninvited and unescorted , he did not dare to trespass . Jimmie then pulled Oliphant in another direction entirely , in order to show him the live oak that was his favorite part of Indigo Reach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Den me free like de buzzut and de great blues ! " Oliphant could not observe the daily routine of the Royalls ' slaves  --  about two dozen adults here and an equal number of children  --  because they were too excited by Narcissa 's second surprise . There was to be a wedding at noon of two Negro couples . The brides , Phoebe and Coffee , were from Indigo Reach and they were marrying two brothers from the nearby Elliot plantation of Town 's End . The service was held on the front porch of the big house . The parson , a tiny Anglican from St. Helenville , the Reverend Dillion , arrived with the Elliots  --  an older couple who fussed over Oliphant . There were as many white faces as black at the ceremony  --  Fripps , Stuarts , Smiths  --  for the neighborhood seemed delighted to gather at Narcissa 's beckoning . And Narcissa was very much in control . She provided yet another feast : of turtle steaks , venison , wild ducks , cured hams , rice pots , pound cakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding party ; and of enormous pots of venison and oysters in rice with fruit pies for the general Negro population who collected on the back porch . She also gave the two couples wedding presents : a pile of blankets , bedding , cotton mattresses , and bolts of muslin . The loudest praise from the Negroes was for the two spinning wheels that Granby Royall gave Phoebe and Coffee as their dowries , though Oliphant could see that the spinning wheels were actually from Narcissa . She had arranged this extravagance so that her father would garner praise for his generosity . Narcissa even provided two new broomsticks , which the couples hopped over again and again to uproarious cheering . Narcissa 's Negro overseer , a black-skinned nub of a man named Joseph , explained the custom to Oliphant . " Fer who de driber and who de mule in de house . He dat trip , he ' fore de plow . ' N it best dat de man do de fallin ' . " Oliphant thought Joseph was jesting , but was unable to learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and dancing to music from a fiddler and a man who played " de bones . " Once the celebration had quieted , and the dancing had moved with the Negroes to the rear of the house , Oliphant was able to separate himself fromp254the planters and to find a spot on the lawn where he could be alone with his thoughts . He was trying to judge the Royalls , and along with them , this planter society . And it seemed impossible to him to reach a conclusion about the Royalls without looking carefully at slavery . He was certain of the fact that the Royalls and their neighbors regarded the Negroes as human property  --  like mules before plows ! His temperament could not ignore his father 's Abolitionist opinions ; nor would he ignore the fact that slavery was shocking when viewed for the first time . Yet he was also struck by how thoughtfully the Royalls treated their slaves  --  like dependents , as if they were children , to be housed , nurtured , pleased , even indulged like the darling Jimmie . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , that in exchange for these parental services the Negroes had to submit themselves to daily toil for their masters , or to absolute judgment by them . Oliphant thought it all so strange ! After nearly a fortnight in the South , and four days studying slaveholding near at hand , Oliphant was still unable to state to himself his feelings about the nature of slavery . He could only approximate to himself that slavery seemed an intimate tradition , one that enjoyed the assumptions and power of any correspondingly deeply fixed institution , like marriage . Indeed , Oliphant knew that the slaveholders called slavery " our peculiar Southern institution . " There was nevertheless the monumental question of the morality of slavery . For the Negro , Oliphant understood , to be free was an apotheosis . " Freedom " was in the slave 's everyday language ; it was held up as the ultimate goal and virtue . It was no less a desired thing than beauty and to be beautiful was to the planters . And Oliphant asked himself , What human being would voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she had to be ugly ? And what sort of human being would choose to keep another person ugly if it was in his or her power to grant beauty ? On the lawn before Indigo Reach , Oliphant ate venison from his plate and drank wine from his cup and pondered the Royalls and slavery . It was while he was in this mood that Narcissa chanced to approach him . She and Camellia sashayed over to ask after his comfort . Oliphant , forgetting himself , spoke out loud thoughts that he was unsure of inside himself ; he said , meaning to be gay , " I am very happy , Mrs. Winwood . Who would n't be ? On such a day , even Uncle Tom could find peace . " Narcissa flared at him . " Oh , Mrs. Stowe and Uncle Tom . Mrs. Stowe andp255Uncle Tom ! Mrs. Stowe and Uncle Tom ! ! Ding , dong , ding , dong ! Spinelesscant and false piety , and not a flick of common sense or decent intelligence . This is my life ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , Oliphant had seen the fire in her , and she did not conceal it in her conclusion . She said , " You shall see of us what you shall see , Cousin . As for those who defame us  --  rope is never ready for the Pharisees . And , I suppose , a cross is never far from pharisaical hands . " Oliphant was prevented from exploring Narcissa 's political philosophy further by her third surprise  --  a continuation of the expedition . And Narcissa and her two daughters , a black-haired and a red-haired child , 7 and 5 , were joining the party . Soon enough , leaving Maum Rosemary and Joseph to manage the ongoing wedding party , the Royalls were off in the carriages by the short route to St. Helenville , a hamlet of a dozen summer cottages and two church spires at the mouth of a broad creek and at the shore of the vast St. Helena Sound . Their new destination was Edisto Island across the sound , and The Acreage , the 650-acre Sea Island cotton and rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met at the St. Helenville wharf by the oldest son , J. Granby " Johnny " Royall II , at the helm of a thirty-two-foot single-masted sloop , and they hurriedly loaded their baggage and a cold supper for the crossing due east to Edisto . It was a glorious fifteen-mile sail with the ebb tide across a seascape first green with splashes of white wavelets and then made purple and orange by the sunset . They came about into the shadows of the evening and raced darkness to landfall at Clark 's Inlet on the windwardside of Edisto . The broad rolling white beach was laced with twists of seaweed and speckled with hopping gulls . Here there was a ramshackle wharf and another small settlement , Eddingsville , that was mostly factors ' warehouses and rugged log cabins , with a periphery of slave quarters glowing in firelight . Oliphant had no time to inspect the village  --  the swampiest and crudest place he had yet seen  --  for they were off immediately in two carriages and a flatbed wagon . They rolled and weaved five miles north into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too dark , and Oliphant was too tired , to gain a good view of the plantation , he could determine that it was larger and busier than either New Cross , Old Cross , or Indigo Reach.  |p256The  big house was the now-familiar pale tabby rectangle , with several cedar-built extensions that indicated a long and many-handed history . Johnny Royall was a dark , lordly figure , larger than his brother Talbird , with a thick torso and heavy brown beard . He was said by Camellia to be a first-rate horseman who had raced his own horses in Charleston and won a goodly amount of money . Johnny and his wife , Elizabeth , had four children under 5 years of age , and presided over a large household staff and more than ninety slaves including children . A curious feature of The Acreage was the wood-built praise house , a form of church for the slaves , that stood like an A-shaped chapel not far from the big house . Oliphant went outside to observe a late-night celebration in the praise house . Mrs. Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're devout people , Mr. Oliphant , very devout . And tomorrow is Palm Sunday . " She was a shapely , olive-complexioned woman of 24 , whose family 's wealth , she said , had originated in Barbados sugar plantations . Oliphant escorted her back into the house , and they were served excellent French brandy in delicate snifters . Elizabeth took Oliphant over to an oil painting , a landscape of a cataract on the Nile River . Oliphant admired it , and said that he had visited Egypt in his student days . Elizabeth then made what Oliphant thought to be an unusual speech . " My sisters-in-law have written that you are a man of the world . I do hope this means we two shall agree in the face of their stubborn dismissal of my religion . I am Presbyterian , like you . And we must do sentry duty against their priestly Anglicanism and cold suspicions . We must also guard our hearts from deceit and wickedness . It is the eve of Easter Week , and a special time for us , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond with a trivial observation about Easter falling so late in April . Elizabeth did not seem to understand him , and pressed her odd point . " I knew you would understand ! The Lord must save us , each and every one , and it is happy , oh so happy , to have a kindred spirit under my roof at this sad and triumphant time with whom to seek our Savior 's love and to celebrate his entry into Jerusalem ! " Oliphant was puzzled by Elizabeth 's confession of faith , and by her intimation of an understanding between them regarding Presbyterianism . He assumed her piety had long since established the obvious standoffishness he saw between her and Narcissa , two strong minds at the spiritual poles of the Royalls.  |p257And  Oliphant 's observation was confirmed when Narcissa , before retiring Saturday night , caught Oliphant at the bottom of the stairs ; she said , " I 've learned my sister-in-law has already apprised you of the untrustworthiness of the local Anglican clergy ? No . It is n't a serious parting between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless , we cold ' Royalls  --  yes , I know it is her opinion  --  we chilly Royalls shall deliver you to the warmth of Calvinism on the morrow . Did I say warmth ? " Oliphant appreciated the humor , but wondered about the mystery of this promised delivery . It all became clear Sunday morning with Narcissa 's fourth surprise . The whole houseful of Royalls and guests was awakened early , fed a heavy breakfast , and poured into the carriages . The road was alive with planters and slaves en route to worship God . The majority of the planters and their families drove to the Episcopal church at the mid-island crossroads . The majority of the Negroes walked to the Baptist churches ( and a Methodist one they passed ) that were distributed in the groves , either on the plantations or on common , unplanted ground . The Royalls , however , ten children and more than a dozen adults includingthe servants , drove on past the Anglican crowd for the Edisto PresbyterianChurch up the road half a mile . Narcissa , Camellia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth glanced sternly at the trio and nodded her head sympathetically to Oliphant . Oliphant was amused by both demonstrations , and also by the sight , a white clapboard structure that seemed a marriage of the church architecture of the North and the South . It had a two-story box shape with arched windows , a stout white steeple , and a courtly facade of four , heavy grooved columns that supported a plain entablature . Behind the church was a low-fenced graveyard set in a deep piney wood that was drenched with blooming azaleas and dogwoods . The gathering of carriages and people before the church was modest-sized and comely . These Carolina Calvinists looked to Oliphant to avoid the monotones of their Yankee kindred for pastel dresses , white and buff morningcoats , and high top hats . All the worshippers knew Elizabeth Royall and her brood , and were eager to welcome the extended Royall clan . Narcissa appeared familiar with the neighbors and introduced Oliphant to the Hext family . In a pause , Narcissa asked Oliphant , " How does this compare to your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witticism . " My father , when he was in a parish , would have said , ' Carpentered by disciples , though to be occupied by ingrates ! ' I say , no comparison , Mrs. Winwood , none . " Elizabeth Royall overheard , misunderstood , and commented , " We can/not hope to match the grandeur of Philadelphia , Mr. Oliphant . We do hope that we worship with like zeal , and keep our house of God an inviting home for all ages and sorts . " Oliphant returned , " You must believe me  --  this is sublime , everything here , sublime , Mrs. Royall . When I say , incomparable , the contest is unequal , in your magnificent favor . " This settled Elizabeth Royall 's opinion of Oliphant as the Treaty of Paris ended the Revolution . She beamed . She took Oliphant from Narcissa and Camellia and escorted him into the Royall pew . The Royalls overflowed into an adjoining De Treville  --  Langdon pew . Oliphant was seated at the junction of both boxes , catercorner from the benevolent-looking Granby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the service , exchanged more than a few glances with her in order to communicate his pleasure . The pastor , a dutiful sexagenarian , only mentioned hell once , and otherwise preached lucidly from the Gospels concerning the disorderliness in the streets of Jerusalem before the Savior 's arrival . The best part of the service for Oliphant was the singing , since the Negro servants who filled the galleries of the church gave of their voices fully and with a spirit that sounded transcendent . Oliphant had never heard such resonance , and was amazed . After one especially vibrant chorus , he looked to Narcissa and smiled . Narcissa waited for an opportunity , then leaned across the wall of the pew to whisper , " My maumer , Aunt Rosemary , she taught me , You buckrah have books and such , but the black folk have the Lord 's ear . ' " Elizabeth again overheard , misunderstood , and interjected , " The Lord has ears enough , and eyes enough , for all his children , and their repentant cares . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate glance  --  the two eldest children of two proud families revealing to each other their understanding and tolerance of rivalrous siblings . Oliphant saw an additional quality in Narcissa 's gaze . He stared overlong at those symmetrical features and those judgmental eyes . His intelligence came to him like a gift . He saw in her the delight of a designer , as God was the Great Designer of heaven and earth . He asked himself what his discovery meant . Why should she be so obviously and exceedingly satisfied at his pleasure in this robust company on this sunny Carolina day on this fragrant island in this garden archipelago ?  |p259Oli|phant  's curiosity about Narcissa 's motives increased throughout the day until the great gathering at sundown of Royalls , De Trevilles , and Langdons for a feast at The Acreage . At last , after dining , Oliphant was moved to try out his newfound theory that Narcissa had some design behind all her surprises . He spontaneously followed her from the table and caught her at the base of the stairs before she went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good time to linger in conversation , what with the other adults distributed throughout both drawing rooms and servants sliding all about with trays , so Oliphant decided that he must speak forthrightly . He hoped his bluntness might penetrate Narcissa 's presence of mind and get to her candor , and beneath that , to her heart . " Mrs. Winwood , " he began , " I 've had a day  --  day after day  --  of serene delight . I am wondering , though  --  " " How so , Cousin ? " She ducked her head to arrange her pale gown ; she took the first step and turned , so that she was at eye level with Oliphant with her shawl tucked up like a mantle . " We could easily have attended Palm Sunday services in Beaufort , withoutthis extraordinary procession , " continued Oliphant . " That is , I  --  I am under the impression that you are not usually a voyaging family . " " That may be . Papa has enjoyed this . We should do it more . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was for me , is n't that true ? " Oliphant exhaled . " To come this long way in this fashion ? For Presbyterian services on Edisto for Presbyterian John Oliphant ? " " Why , what is it that you 'd suppose ? " " I 'd suggest that you are quite the most extravagant maker-of-gestures I have ever imagined . I 'm knocked . " She replied , " And not happy ? " " It is crucial to you that I am , is n't it ? Please , yes . I am happy , and happy again , and happy over and over . What man would n't be ? Your family is a memory of unspeakable joy . " " My family ? " She lowered her voice . " Yours too . We must always be together in this splendid memory you propose . Really , you 're the most pleasing reader of books and thinker of thoughts we Royalls have ever found among us . They both laughed , Narcissa somewhat more fully than Oliphant , to Oliphant 's embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous . He wanted to impress her . Oliphant said , " I must , I must say , I want you to know , this  --  that you are extraordinary . That you are a rare find for me . It is true , the Oliphants are bookish . I am dull and bookish . And I am too much contained by unlivable and unlived ideals , and too much defined by commercial and banal pursuits . " " No , no ! " she said . " Ideals and ambitions , books and economies , they are necessary , and much missed here . No , Cousin , "  --  Narcissa nodded  --  " I am struck by your learning , and wish that I had had more of it , and wish and wish . I ca n't imagine further along . " She made a traveling motion with her right hand , and pulled it back . " I would assume , from your speech , that you do understand how very much it is my wish and my hope and my prayer that we remain together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Oliphant smiled . " My father would say , This is a prayer that rings of proposal . ' " " Why , John ! " And she blushed . Oliphant stepped back , then forward again . Narcissa recovered first , and said , " I am flattered supremely . A married woman should hear such things ! And let the jays scatter their seeds where they will . " It was Oliphant 's turn to blush . " I did n't mean  --  " " I am a married woman , " Narcissa interrupted . " My sister  --  " Oliphant heard himself talking ; he was headlong . " Camellia is a beautiful young woman whose heart is as honest and full as your own . " Narcissa closed the bargain before Oliphant realized there was a document to sign , or a peace to gain , nourish , and protect . She said , " We 're agreed on this , you and I , and have much to discuss , true ? And time to do it in , not forgetting your mama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , John ? Your departure is exaggerated , is n't it ? You shall remain among us as long as you can , short of Our Lord 's Kingdom actually coming on ? " " Yes , yes , Narcissa . Yes , short of that , yes . " Narcissa reached out with her right hand to touch Oliphant on the mouth with her fingers . She ran her fingertips across his lips . Her message for secrecy was a ticklish and silent one . Oliphant stood still when she turned to disappear up the stairs . Now he was truly dumbfounded . She had overwhelmedhim with her final surprise of this expedition ; that is , even when he thought himself her equal in the conversation , she had outmaneuvered him . How powerful was she ? Narcissa had persuaded him to an arrangement between them  --  profoundly concerning the Itoyalls  --  the terms of which hep261did not know ! She had asked for and taken a carte blanche ! And like the rest of the Royalls , Oliphant felt himself now at Narcissa 's call , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there , finding his hands , pulling out his pipe and tobacco pouch . At last he understood in a gust of good feeling what had eluded him this past week of serial discovery in the Sea Islands . He talked to himself , " Paradise , John , snake and apple and all , you 've found Paradise . " Then he laughed , and searched his pockets . He needed a light . He looked up the stairway . He decided to go to Camellia . She liked to light his pipe . He would sit with her , and chat of Palestine , and await Narcissa 's return.  |p262WEDNESDAY  AFTERNOON , NOVEMBER 16 , 1864Narcissa lay lightly on her left side , one leg behind her to intertwine with Oliphant 's legs . Her buttocks were fitted against his hip , her shoulder blades nestled under his shoulder , her arms tucked like wings against her own breasts , and her hands folded beneath her chin to provide a neat cushion . She was arranged so gracefully because she was not deeply asleep , only relaxing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muggy and misty , and they had thrown the bedcovers back during their love-making . Oliphant relaxed half upright beside Narcissa , his whole body rotated slightly to provide her a fleshy rest . He was smoothing his cheek and lips with a crooked finger . He glanced at the moist and shiny hairs about his penis , and then up across the room to the embers in the fireplace at the far wall , and then he let his eyes wander over the chairs and settee draped with their clothes to the satinwood vanity table at the left wall that was stacked with Narcissa 's jewelry box , brushes , and things in the midst of several vases of cut flowers , thep263ivy on the iron banister was a slick , green band against the brownish orange and yellow of the upper reaches of a gigantic chestnut tree that spread its aged limbs like a friend across the breadth of the second floor rear of the Georgetown home of Narcissa 's great-aunt , Mrs. George ( Louisa Granby ) Turning . Oliphant felt a chill ; he hooked the comforter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gently over Narcissa 's legs . She kicked it off and rolled farther into her hands and pillows . She also made a humming sound , and flipped her hair out of her face . Oliphant said , " Fine , " and fixed the cover on his legs only . Narcissa became overheated in her passion , sometimes to the point of fainting . Her body still showed pools of pinkish skin on her back and splotches of red at her neck . It made her look healthier . Oliphant traced his left hand down along the valley created where her rib cage joined her pelvis . Her skin was too white . She was too thin . He gripped her hip point like a saddle horn and pulled her buttocks closer . Narcissa 's body was a precious atlas to Oliphant . Here was the geography of a frantic forty-year life that he could read with sympathy and caution for what it told of the interior life of a woman . She thought her feet too small and inadequate for the demands of hiking and riding that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and afterward . They were squarish , with close-together toes and a minor arch , not what they should have been for the running of a family and the running from her starkly imagined fears : from the fear of emptiness when she had lost her mother to the lingering complications of too many and too near births and miscarriages when Narcissa was 14 ; from the fear of abandonment when her father had placed her in a Washington City school between her fourteenth and sixteenth years , 1839  --  41 ; from the fear of heartbreak when her starcrossedsuitor , Hawk Winwood , had gone off to the Mexican War after their betrothal in 1846 ; from the fear of a wasting death like her mother 's after Narcissa 's second consecutive miscarriage in 1854 . Narcissa 's legs were lean and long , to Oliphant 's delight . She thought them " stickish , and most scarified . " There were indeed scars , like mementos of her velocity . The burn mark on her left ankle , copper-penny-sized , was from when a pan of boiling soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , an accident Narcissa explained had been the result of a tantrum she had launched upon her two guardians , Aunt Louisa and Maum Rosemary , when they had kept Narcissa from attending a Marine dance at the President'sp264House . The jagged line on her right kneecap was from that horrible night when she had tumbled down the stairs with her father in December 1861 as they were trying to save the family and their Charleston house in the great fire . And the white lines on her hips and the backs of her thighs were from childbirth , the commonplace expanding and shrinking of flesh , and Narcissa was alternately annoyed by and proud of them  --  what she had to show in flesh for her daughters Sophy and Martha , who were now 17 and 15 and living in Savannah with Camellia . Her back was straight and very downy above her buttocks , with prominentshoulder blades that were a product of a posture that Oliphant had once thought overstaff . As he had come to know her , he had understood that she walked so carefully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narcissa 's shoulders was higher than another , and her mother had told her she must compensate with a stern gait . It was silly of Narcissa , and another sort of person would have let herself become more natural . Yet Narcissa idolized her mother 's memory , and often talked to herself , " Up girl , up ! " This controlled posture naturally pushed her breasts forward . They were Oliphant 's pleasure  --  not large , and not matched , the left nipple formed with a notch . Oliphant teased her that she was God-given with an extra half teat . She did not always enjoy the joke , because it spoke to her doubts about her sense of nurture . She could weep in her frustration when a loved one did not obey her decisions for them . She had wept in the fall of 1855 when Oliphant had insisted upon taking his new bride , Camellia , on an extended European honeymoon ; for he and Narcissa had already been lovers then , and she had thought Oliphant only deferring the test they must suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed again and again over the years . She had wept when Granby Royall had ordered the whole family to flee Beaufort for Charleston  --  and not for Indigo Reach or The Acreage  --  during the Federal invasion of Port Royal Sound in November 1861 . She had wept when her stepmother Pamela Royall had ignored Narcissa 's pleas and had taken the very ill Granby Royall home to London  --  because a severe case of erysipelas had supervened from the bruise he had suffered in his fall with Narcissa in Charleston and his foot had had to be amputated in Savannah . And she had wept in her bleakest manner when her surviving half-brother Harry had volunteered into the Confederate Navy at 16 without telling any of his family , and had left England for blockade running on the doomed C.S.S. Alabama . Importantly , for all her tears of frustration , Narcissa was not given top265displays of anger . She was a cool thinker and a dispassionate strategist . This diplomatic temperament was what had made her  --  a profoundly patriotic Southern partisan  --  such a remarkable agent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool could surpass her sense of intrigue or her ability to coax aid from the English . Oliphant had once overheard the stridently anti-Confederate Lord John Russell himself , foreign minister of Palmerston 's so-called neutral government , describe Narcissa : " A damned rock of an island ! Not seamed or occupied . A damned appealing monolith in petticoats ! " Oliphant had repeated the image soon after to Narcissa , and she had said , " The old flirt wants what he wo n't buy ! " In London , Narcissa was indeed wanted , a much sought guest and much attended hostess . She had entertained at her stepmother 's townhouse in St. John 's Wood . Oliphant had admired her social and political power , while he had admitted to her that he was often jealous of the warren of English game that surrounded her at the fetes . For Narcissa in full feather was a striking human being . An English admirer had said , and Oliphant had playfully agreed , that her face was a meeting on high ground of alabaster radiance and self-possessed purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty jaw like a cannoneer sighting a target , and then she pronounced , eruditely and musically . She was a grand talker . She liked homey stories and liked to retell them with colloquially accurate dialogue . She particularly favored stories that " dripped yolk on long-beards "  --  her way of saying how she deflated the pompous . Narcissa was such a renowned raconteur that Oliphant had long thought there was a question as to her effectiveness as a partisan . The English admired her as if she were a famous stage actress , and did not uniformly hear her illustrations of Southern indomitability as accurate . They thought her spinningyarns , and loved her for it , and did not seem able to understand that her pleas for sympathy , money , and help for the Confederacy were not part of an anecdote but real , and desperate . There were opinions other than Oliphant 's of Narcissa 's worth as a Confederate partisan , and they were more sanguine . Oliphant had once questioned Judah Benjamin as to what he wanted of Narcissa in England . Judah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter of 1862 ; he was then Confederate secretary of state at Richmond , having left the United States Senate with his friend , Jefferson Davis , and having first served as Confederate secretary of war before moving to thep266Confederate State Department in a corner of the former Virginia Statehouse . But Judah Benjamin was more tellingly a longtime Beaufort neighbor of the Royalls , on King Street , just down from Chinaberry , where he had passed his summers  --  an inelegant fox of a man , crescent-bearded , long-haired , round-waisted , with a weakness for sweets that he claimed could exhaust his Louisiana sugar plantations . Oliphant had known from the first meeting in Richmond , in March 1862 , what Judah Benjamin wanted of him , for Oliphantwas tailor-made as a courier and confidential agent in Europe . But what was Narcissa for ? Oliphant had waited for an opportunity to meet with Judah Benjamin alone at his home in Richmond  --  while Narcissa was resting at the hotel  --  and had asked him straight out . " Why risk Mrs. Winwood , sir ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she be for ? " Judah Benjamin had twinkled . " To put the head on the great John C. Calhoun statue the English make of us ! To show , Mr. Oliphant . To show that will of hers , to show what is fighting here , and what is worth fighting for here . Mr. Oliphant , if she is not , who is , the South ? To show , God , to show ! " Oliphant rolled to his left to enclose Narcissa with the length of his body . He ran his left hand over her hip and past the fleshy pocket at her belly into the dark hairs at the curve of her sex . She brought her right leg up and clutched him there and then squeezed her thigh muscles . He said , " I love you . " She spoke into her hands , a muffled " Do n't . " He said , " I know , " not truly knowing why she had spurned his sentiment . After a moment , she said , " I do love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . He kissed her palm , and then shifted his weight to get up on top of her by rolling her onto her back . She let her hair spill over her face , her arms fall like swinging spars , and her legs sink flat and open . Oliphant took hold of her right hand again and kissed the four knuckles and then the fingers . Her hand , like the rest of her , was battered  --  a fingernail split , the thumb scraped badly from when she had helped manhandle Granby Royall 's coffin into the conservatory downstairs . Oliphant took her hand to his throat . He arched up to use his arms and legs to cover her torso like a blanket . Her flesh felt loose , and was sallow across her chest and belly , from the precipitousweight loss this past summer . She was only a little stronger than shep267had been the week before upon disembarking Australasian . Death gouged at Narcissa Royall . In nine months , she had suffered the loss of her last brother Johnny , her last half-brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never divorced ) , her brother-in-law Lucas Rogers who had been Laura Royall 's groom ( and who was missing in the battle for Atlanta ) , as well as her father Granby Royall . And all this had come after three years of funerals and defeats . Oliphant thought it a miracle that she was able to sleep through the night , or mostly , and that she still had an appetite , however inconstant or mercurial , for food and sex . Oliphant raised his head . " We should talk . We must make plans . " " Not now . I do n't want to think . If I do , you 'll leave me . " " Narcissa , do n't do that . I am not leaving . " " You 'll go . They all have . The order will come and you shall appear at the door and then you shall go . " Oliphant jarred her . " Look at me . Look . Open your eyes . I am not leaving . You are talking like this because you 're discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made a fair beginning . We are here , are n't we ? And the Navy Department is not the last recourse . This is a bribe city . " " What is there ? They do n't want him buried ! They do n't care for decency ! They are afraid of an old man 's corpse ! They are n't Christians ! " " We care . We 're right . " Oliphant calmed himself ; his abruptness had upset her . He must avoid dissidence , for it seemed to make her feel hopeless . He continued , " Your father was n't a Rebel , and they ca n't prove that he was . He was a kind old planter , and they know it , and they know he lost everything and his life by bad luck . They do believe that . It is part of war to suspect and resist the innocent . We shall prevail upon them , for we are telling truth . It will take more time . Mr. Fox did agree to see us , Narcissa . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move on to other officials  --  to use the interview with Fox in our favor . " That morning , Narcissa and Oliphant had finally won an audience with the assistant secretary of the navy , Captain Gustavus V. Fox , a placid man with a reputation of having Lincoln 's ear . ( Lincoln was said to have observed , " Fox is the Navy Department . " ) Fox was therefore the man who held the power they needed to get themselves and the coffin on board a Federal ship bound for the headquarters of the Department of the South on the beach at Hilton Head Island , and from there up to Beaufort . They had sat in the Navy Department corridor all Friday , Saturday , Monday , and Tuesday , not daring to give up their place in line for luncheon , given the chaos aroundp268them of other favor seekers and bereaved relatives searching for missing sailors . Then , Tuesday evening , Oliphant had pressed a sum of money into the correct hands , and this morning they had secured an interview with Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Fox grinning . " It ca n't be done . Not now . Not any way . " Oliphant had protested politely . Fox had said , " Good day , sir , good day , madam , and please  --  what you ask is impossible now . " Oliphant had explained to a stony Narcissa en route back to Georgetown what the obstacle might be to their extraordinary but not impossible request : in a word , Sherman . Major-General William T. Sherman , hero of Atlanta in September , and savior of Lincoln 's presidential campaign , was widely rumored to have prepared his army at Atlanta , following Election Day , for a new campaign in the South . The Washington Morning Chronicle had announced , November 9 , that Sherman had burned Atlanta and was marchingon Charleston ; but the next day the Chronicle had withdrawn the rumor , and had hinted that Sherman had withdrawn to Chattanooga , and was still preparing his seven corps for a campaign . It was all a deliberate confusion of military gossip . Nevertheless , the certain result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal occupied coast closest to Sherman 's army , were restricted . By accident , then , Narcissa 's suit to bury Granby Royall had run head on into the biggest wall of secrecy in the war . Narcissa had listened to Oliphant 's explanation , and burst , " Damn Sherman ! Damn him and his inhuman murderers ! Damn him for eternity ! " She had followed this with a morbid frown . It had frightened Oliphant when , after their return , she had pulled him upstairs to her room , and pulled at his clothes and her own . Her love-making had been very needful and finally sad-making . It was now hours later , and Oliphant could see that the woman in his embrace was not ready to debate tactics . It was her nature to pout after a disappointment . She was first a charger , and only long after a plotter . For now , she must accept that a bold move was futile . He lay quietly atop her until he was sure she was not going to weep . He decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " I have a dinner engagement with your friend , Henry Blondel . " She cleared her hair from her face . " You did n't tell me . " " I am now . He sent his card this morning , before you came down . He hints that he might have found an opening for us at the State Department . You did n't tell me that you had asked his aid in this . " John Oliphant at Washington City , District of f Columbia 2 6 9 " When ? On Sunday ? No , we only talked . He 's always known that we would have to struggle to get to Beaufort . We just chatted pleasantly . " After services on Sunday , the 13th , at Georgetown 's Presbyterian Church down the road , Narcissa had gone off with Blondel for a drive . They had asked Oliphant to accompany them , but he had thought their invitation halfhearted , and had begged off . Oliphant asked , " What did you talk about ? " " Henry 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when Papa died . You know this . I could n't have  --  You agreed he should help me . It was your idea . " Oliphant had been in Paris when Granby Royall had suffered his final decline in September , and had been en route to London when he had died , September 30 . He had arrived at the townhouse with only a day until his sailing date from Liverpool , but had delayed it a full week to help Narcissa make her plans . Then he had been obliged to sail for Canada , because of Beverley Tucker 's cotton deal . Blondel had come forward then , and had promised Oliphant he would help get Narcissa and the coffin onto a steamer to follow . It had been very generous of him , because Pamela Royall had been too stunned to assist by the death of her last son and then her husband . Oliphant had been acquainted with Blondel for over a year  --  since the man 's return from India  --  but had only met him twice before October , because of Oliphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholic fellow , most attentive to his older brother , who was Pamela Royall 's brother-in-law . Then again , Oliphant did not deceive himself about Blondel . He was jealous of him . And he felt threatened by Narcissa 's affection for him  --  a striking , sad-eyed , invalided widower , with a privileged position in the peckish henhouse of English society . Consequently , Oliphant spoke cautiously . " Is there anything you might want to tell me ? About Blondel ? No delicate secrets now , not after  --  It 's too late for that . " Narcissa spoke as if in normal conversation , and not lying naked beneath him . " What is it you want me to say ? " " The truth . What we have . The truth . " " This is me , John , not one of your agents . If Henry says he can help , I am sure he means it . He has a childhood friend in the embassy here . He told me . A confidant of Lord Lyons . A Jew with influence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say what he had in mind specifically . " " John , there is no need for this suspicion . 1 ie 's a good friend , that is thep270extent of it . He came over with me to help me . But also to see the country , and the war close on . He is a soldier . It is what he knows . But India nearly killed him . You can see it in him . Do you know about his laudanum ? He 's not what he appears . That malaria killed his wife , and might kill him too . His hair is white , and he 's only forty-two . " Narcissa turned her head in profile . " Do n't do this . We have enough trouble without distrusting each other . " " Amen , " said Oliphant . He lowered his head onto her upper chest . He was too off-center to hear her heartbeat . The moments passed , marked by the popping embers in the fire and then the churchbell outside chiming 4 P.M. Narcissa had told Oliphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a schoolgirl , longing for Beaufort at the same time she fancied the military suitors in Washington whom she was too young to attract . It still had the ambience of a girl 's room  --  pure colors and virginal clutter , with dolls set atop the wainscoting . There was a big red-haired doll in Oliphant 's field of vision . It reminded him of his daughters . Narcissa shifted beneath him . " You do agree , and believe me ? It is crucial that you do . I need your faith . I ca n't lose you too . I understand about Papa . I feel we can find a way . I lose confidence sometimes . You hold me up . I need you . I have always needed you . We 're a match ! Neither of us can carry on alone . Oh , please , I do love you for what you have always done for me . I always shall . John ? " " Yes , I 'm here , I 'm listening . " Narcissa took hold of his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was thinking of things . Your red doll . Things in general . " Narcissa whispered , " Cammie ? " " No . Well , some . About you and her being alone . What it would be like for you both without me . For you . I worry about you . I make a fool of myself over a troubled Englishman . And yes , I was thinking of Camellia . She 's there with all the children and has nothing but our letters , if they get through . I think about how much better it would be if you could get to her , or I could . What can we do for her here ? Write her of death , and worse . " She said we must do what we must . " Narcissa referred to the last letter from Camellia that had gotten through the blockade , via Mexico , dated June 29 ; it had contained news of Laura 's bereavement , and also the fact that Narcissa 's eldest daughter Sophy was engaged to a Georgia officer serving with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narcissa 's face . " I was thinkingJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 2 71p271of Camellia a lot last night . She sounded strong in her letter , she did . She made it sound as if we should n't worry . And yet she does n't know the worst . " " She 's known Papa was very ill . " " Yes . " Oliphant sighed . " God knows about the mail . My September letters got to Richmond , I 'm reasonably sure , but from there  --  I know Camellia can stand up . I know you can . It 's me who 's weak . What sort of help am I ? I doubt , and defer , and shrink . Oh , the things I worry about , Narcissa , the small , intangible things . And Camellia has never questioned us , all these years . I worry about that too . I do n't understand how she can be so  --  how you sisters can be so  --  stout-hearted . " " We are what is left , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must trust each other . Always . " " I hear the lesson . " " Do n't pull away from me . " Narcissa closed her arms about Oliphant 's neck and used her right leg to urge his weight down onto her pelvis . She extended her whole body to make it level beneath him , and then opened her legs and brought them up to grip him with her thighs at his hip . She pulled his face down to hers as she sank into her pillow . She kissed him on the lips , very heatedly and needfully . Oliphant returned the kiss . But at the same time he felt far away and lost . He was beckoned back to Narcissa by the feel and smell of the tangy wetness of her sex that pressed up against his abdomen . He broke the kiss and ducked his head , so that he spoke to her neck . " Narcissa , Narcissa , what is wrong with me ? Why am I so afraid ? As I 've never felt before . Is it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done for three years has been for nothing . As if it was all hopeless . As if I ca n't help you , or myself , or anyone . I feel so incompetent , and useless . " " Is there something you 're not telling me about Canada , about what they wanted you to do ? " " No , no , it was a waste , and is done with . Their schemes and their plots . A waste . I told them so before I left . I wired Canada , and I passed on a note to Richmond , and I told them that I thought them all foolish . I wanted to tell them that I quit , but I did n't . They wo n't listen to me , but so what ? I ca n't make them understand that all that 's left is to make a deal . I ca n't instruct the world , and if I could , what would I tell it ? That there is no victory ? That there is only hope ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that again ? " " Oh , my dear , dear friend , oh John . " She kissed him lightly on the facep272and stroked his hair . She added , " You are very brave , John , and very honest . You can do anything . " Oliphant smiled . He needed her so . He loved her so . He said , " You can make me feel that I can do anything . " She kissed him harder on the face , but when she relaxed into her pillow , she spoke tentatively . " I ca n't make you stay when you have to go . " Now it was Oliphant 's turn to reassure her ; he said , " Yes you can  --  anything , anything at all . " " Then make love to me again , and make us happy . " " Narcissa , I ca n't , I just ca n't . " She moved , and he moved , and they laughed like fools . Oliphant said , " Can I ? " Narcissa 's great-aunt 's home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , and homes converted to rooms-to-let on Georgetown 's sedate Washington Street , just north of the village 's main thoroughfare , Bridge Street . The house was set right up on the sidewalk . It was brick-built , with a cut-stone facade  --  a double house , really , that had never been divided , box-like and crowned by a corniced roof and double chimneys , with a single mahogany door off-center to the north up a small stoop . Otherwise , it was anonymously gray , with walls on three sides to enclose sugar maples , black oaks , and dogwoods at its flanks in addition to the great chestnut tree in the rear garden . Since the beginning of the war , and especially since the Second Battle of Bull Run in July 1862 , the house had usually been close-shuttered and unlit . As daylight faded in the low stone-gray sky on Wednesday afternoon , however , the windows on the first floor of the house showed a warm , yellow light . At a quarter to five  --  the grandfather clock at the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small window in the mahogany front door to peek out into the weather . The mist had eased . The overcast did look to be lifting in parts , but the wind was strengthening , threatening either more rain or a cold snap . Oliphant turned to the side table to brush the sleeves of his dress coat . He had chosen his newest and most fashionable evening clothes and a bright , undyed Sea Island cotton shirt . He thought that he looked the very sober and refined diplomat who was intending either to deliver a war note or to attend a charity hall . He had also decided on his best silk top hat and **25;13382;TOOLONG overcoat , which heightened the effect of a latter-day Puritan off to stroll the corridors of state power , and piously . He reached into the stand for a large English cane umbrella with an ivory handle . He waved that umbrella 's handle at the north-side parlor door , but did not tap because he heard a voice from inside . He stepped quietly through the door to find Maum Rosemary seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren and one grandnephew , Jimmie , Jinna , Nell , and Cato . Jimmie waved to Oliphant and smiled . The reading sounded familiar to Oliphant , and he listened while Maum Rosemary concluded a scene . It was indeed something of Walter Scott 's , Maum Rosemary 's favorite author . In her dowdy green wool and skull cap , she was a pedagogical and energetic old woman , over 60 now , and self-confident in her special station as senior female in the family . It had once been a shock to Oliphant to learn from Narcissa that Maum Rosemary , through the bizarre nature of slavery , was Narcissa 's aunt  --  the bastard daughter of Granby Royall 's Charleston uncle . And thus Maum Rosemary was Granby Royall 's cousin ( and Louisa Granby Turning 's niece ) . It was not a talked-about fact  --  nor was it unheard of in other slaveholding families . The surprise of it had long left Oliphant . Maum Rosemary was a profoundly integral member of the Royalls . Oliphanthad come to depend upon her , as did Narcissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the volume on a bookmark . Oliphant said , " Maumer , I shall be out the evening . She 's asleep . " Maum Rosemary replied , as he knew she would , " I 'll take up a tray . " " You goin ' to de President 's ? " asked Jimmie . " Mind yer own , boy , and keep de peace , " said Maum Rosemary . Oliphant said , " No , Jim , I 'm not . Near there though . What is it ? " " I do set , sir , on seein ' President Lincoln for myself . " His sisters and cousinagreed . Jimmie added , " We all make it a shine-eye-ting ! " And they giggled . Maum Rosemary said , " Mars Jan , ye carry on and do n't mind dese anddo n't get wet feet . " " Yes 'm , " said Oliphant , slipping out of the room with a wave . He knew Maum Rosemary 's fear of pneumonia . He also knew the genesis of Jimmie 's inquiry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half years in London , and their corresponding raised expectations of life  --  Hyde Park in comparison to St. Helena Island  --  were revealed in the size of their dreams . More pertinently , the Sunday before , Oliphant had told Jimmie , now 14 years old and as wide-eyed and eager as ever , that a " new world " would follow the war . Somehow , in the discussion that followed ,  |p274Jimmie  had secured a promise that Oliphant would take him into WashingtonCity to visit the Capitol building and possibly the President 's House . Oliphant , as a father , knew that it was foolhardy to promise children unless one intended to deliver a prize immediately . Yet there was a dark reason why Jimmie and the others had remained in Georgetown , and in this cluttered , drafty house , in the week since their arrival . The District of Columbia was not safe for Negroes . Tens of thousandsof former slaves , called " contraband " since 1861 , had fled into the District to squat in hovels and open fields right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and uncertain status as emancipated slaves but not enfranchised citizens , had so far overwhelmed the ability and the willingness of the United States government to care for these so-called wards of the state . Not only had it proved impossible to house or doctor them adequately , but also there had not been enough food for them  --  simple soup and bread were beyond the talents of the officiating Treasury Department . In desperation , some freed Negroes had fallen to theft and worse , and even those just stunned into passivity by their wrenching transformation still represented a beggarly threat to the community 's sense of security . And there was always that awful fear of disease , for the epidemic rate in the " contraband " camps was withering . The result of so much failed planning and ignorance by 1864 was that Federal soldiers , lawmen , and vigilantes routinelypatrolled the District of Columbia against the not infrequent acts of crime . There were regular and ghastly tales of brutality against the camps , including murder and burnings-out . Mrs. Louisa Turning 's house was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only other occupants of the house were the two aged Turning house servants ( emancipated in 1861 ) , Bessie and Daniel ; they cared for the brittle nonagenarian Mrs. Mason Turning , who lived as a recluse on the third floor , an aunt of the long deceased Mr. George Turning . The Turnings themselves were scattered throughout America by the fury and paradoxes of the war  --  sons , grandsons , and nephews in both the Union and Confederate armies ; daughters , granddaughters , and nieces in Virginia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Alabama , either awaiting news of their loved ones or mourning a death . Mrs. Louisa Granby Turning , the stocky , white-haired matron , now over 80 , whose stern portrait hung over the parlor fire , had expected to be present to receive her favored grandniece , Narcissa , and the corpse of her nephew ,  |p275Granby  Royall . However , she had been called away in October by sickening news ; she was now off in Virginia not only to help fetch the body of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shenandoah Valley , but also to help yet another granddaughter through the shock of the loss of first her Confederate husband at Petersburg and second her farm , which had been burned by General Sheridan 's campaign to scorch the earth of the Shenandoah Valley . It was the saddest sort of coincidence that Narcissa 's husband , General Winwood , was missing and presumed dead in the massive cavalry raid in July that had brought Sheridan 's wrath down upon the Shenandoah Valley . Confederate General Jubal Early 's ten thousand cavalrymen had dared reason and Grant to attack to within sight of Washington City . It had been a desperate assault that Oliphant presumed might have been part of the original Confederate effort to discredit Lincoln 's bid for reelection . The result of all that now , in mid-November , was numbing grief . Narcissa had read Mrs. Turning 's letter of explanation for her absence , and said , " The country is united on one certain thing , John . The national anthem has become the Death March . " Oliphant regarded this remark to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , it was accurate as to the Turnings . They were a true District of Columbia family in that their loyalties and sacrifices were so split by the rebellion that after the war it might require a battle of family ghosts to sort out all the enmities in a crowded haunting of this forlorn house . The house already had the aura of spirits . Mrs. Turning had arranged the portraits and photographs of her posterity on the tables in her parlors , and had tied black ribbons about the dead ones . To walk from the north side of the house to the south side was to stroll a field of the unforgotten . Oliphant winced at this morbidness as he crossed the hall and passed into the south-side parlor . Here , the air was thick with the funeral smell of old roses . For off the parlor was the conservatory , which Oliphant had to pass through to get outside . And in the conservatory was Granby Royall 's coffin , set up on blocks and covered with wilted garlands of roses . Narcissa had fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had set a small photographic portrait of Granby Royall between them . Her Bible was there too , for she sat out here each evening reading from the Gospels . Oliphant had been with her in 1859 when she had arranged to have photographs made of the whole family during the Christmas holiday inp276Charleston . Or had it been Easter ? There had been a comet that year . It had been after John Brown 's Raid . Narcissa had remarked upon the comet , " An omen , sure , but not for a new grandson . " And then she had insisted upon the portraits . And within a month Camellia had delivered Granby Royall another granddaughter . Oliphant was not comfortable with the suggestion of the supernatural . This was a dead man 's photograph . Here was the box of his embalmed remains . His immortal soul was in heaven , with his Savior and his Creator . This was Oliphant 's belief . His further conviction was that this coffin deserveda grave and a stone and a proper Christian burial in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Helena 's Episcopal Church in Beaufort . All together , these opinions had presented Oliphant with a quest . He must get Narcissa through to Beaufort . After his ambition in October , this was not much of a hope to hold on to . The cotton scheme that had brought him across the Atlantic had been there to grasp . Oliphant had applied his talent to the parley in New-York . Had he actually believed in it ? It did not signify . He had done his work and passed on his best advice that the deal was a failure . Oliphant was soon vindicated when the scheme was abandoned . A telegram on Election eve had told Oliphant that Montreal no more trusted Lafayette Baker  --  who had actually presented himself to Beverley Tucker in Montreal  --  than had Oliphant . The telegram had also said that Beverley Tucker would not be traveling to New-York , and that Oliphant was released from his service as a go-between . Oliphant had greeted this news with disgust , and a turning inward . To blazes with Beverley Tucker , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judah Benjamin sort it out ! Oliphant felt no less distaste for the fate of Captain Longuemare 's scheming . Oliphant had telegraphed to Judah Benjamin via the relay operator in Baltimore ( who converted Oliphant 's cipher into his own cipher for a secret courier through the lines to Richmond ) his extremely negative opinion of the Election Day conspiracy . Fortunately , nothing more had come of Longuemare 's plan . The Sons of Liberty had backed down ; Martin and Headley and the rest had been left without a sensible mission . And Oliphant had been spared further exasperationby Longuemare  --  and the fiery Katie MacDonald  --  thanks to the fact that Richmond had chosen not to interfere . At least Judah Benjamin and War Secretary Seddon seemed to have some sense of proportion left . John Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 2 7 7p277Election Day in New-York had passed with no more risk than the flooding in the street , and with no more jeopardy to Kennedy than too much of Oliphant 's wine  --  and that swinging cargo net off Australasian . Oliphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning after the Election . He had also given Kennedy the strong advice that he should quit New-York and sail for New Orleans as soon as possible to visit his parents . Oliphant had said , " The war might be done for us , Mr. Kennedy . Take the chance . Declare a ceasefire and get home for Christmas . " Oliphant had also communicated to Richmond , via Baltimore , that he was leaving New-York for Washington City on personal business . That had been a week ago . Richmond had Oliphant 's Georgetown address . But Richmondremained silent in return . And why ? Because the war really was done , thought Oliphant , and because the Confederacy was a ruin . How could anyone go on ? To Oliphant'smind , not only the war but also the meaning of the war was lost , or simply abandoned , for North and South , for white and black . He could see this in every grim face . It was late , very late , for Oliphant , for the Confederacy , for the Union too . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save what one could of life . Let Richmond , let Washington look to its own as well . Oliphant wanted to cleave to his family , and to Narcissa . Oliphant left the house in a rush . He was talking to himself , and quoting Narcissa 's favorite epigram , " What a dust we make ! " He felt momentarily pleased by the evening coming on and the possibility of actually finding a way to give Narcissa what she desired . He crossed the rear garden in large steps . He did not look up to Narcissa 's room . Noah and Michael were smoking at the potbelly stove in the carriage house . They prepared the landau quickly for Oliphant , hitching up the fat bay . Michael was unhappy when Oliphant told him that he would prefer that he and not Noah drive . Oliphant explained , " It 's liable to storm again . " Michael protested , " I was gwine out later . " Noah was annoyed . " You here , bubbah , and you gwine 's now ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on my own , " said Oliphant . Michael cursed . When Noah stared him down , Michael bent to his task . Michael routinely slipped away at night now ; he also speculated openly to Maum Rosemary about enlisting in the Army and boasted of his freedom to conic and go to the adolescents . Oliphant was not unsympathetic to thep278man 's dilemma  --  a bondsman in the North . While Noah walked out the landau , Oliphant handed Michael a dollar bill that he took without remark . In the landau , Oliphant chose to ignore Michael 's moodiness . They used the carriage track between the townhouses and gained Bridge Street so hurriedly that Michael had to fight with the bay to prevent a collision in the traffic . Oliphant tucked his scarf close and watched the night settle over the cozy brick farming village of Georgetown . At last light , they were stopped on the stone bridge that was the single link from busy Georgetown to the vacant-lot-like periphery of Washington City . Below them was Rocky Creek , a narrow , muddy stream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then flowed onto a swampy basin that opened into the Potomac River . Oliphant was attracted by the campfires below in the deep ravine . He could see a " contraband " camp in the mud , on both sides of the creek . There might have been hundreds of people down there ; all that showed were clutches of children standing about the fires . Farther along the ravine , in silhouette against the blue glow of the horizon , there were more children climbing the wooden superstructure of the watchtower that Georgetown had built in the early days of the war to signal the approach of the enemy from Virginia . They had called it Mosby 's Steeple . Now , the tower stood abandoned , many of its crosspieces stripped off in order to help hold up the shacks below . The watchtower shook as the wind gusted up from the river . Oliphant protected his face and then his hat . The next he looked , they were out of the traffic and across the bridge . Michael cursed the bay , and she accelerated toward Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outermost spokes of the circular and geometrical pattern of the capital 's streets , like being dragged into a vast machine by giant gears that turned clockwise and counterclockwise , in secular time , and drove the screeching crankshafts of the war . WEDNESDAY EVENING , NOVEMBER 16By seven o'clock , the chandelier-lit dining room at Willard 's Hotel was a rolling battlefield of words and impotent demonstrations . The gentlemen were dressed grandiosely for minor gains as they hunched in close counsel at the round and square tables , blew tobacco smoke through the candelabras ,  |p279and  wagged fingers at the darting servants for more wine , sweets , and attention to fortify the debates . It was another ordinary evening in the hotel of choice for Republicans , Union partisans , general staff officers , and fieldgradecommanders on leave with permission to enter the capital , along with the ever anxious and sharp-eared newspapermen , the fashionable nabobs , and the aides-de-camp pausing in their self-congratulatory pursuits to feed upon the gossip and intrigue . Willard 's Hotel stood six stories tall above the mire of Pennsylvania Avenue at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few hundred yards from the White House and the surrounding prickly maze of Cabinet palaces , and was thus a stopping place so convenient to the powerful that it hummed like a dynamo of government , especially after dark , when it was invested with a brilliant vanity . What men wanted or might want was discussed and wept about in daylight up the street at a secretary 's or assistant secretary 's office ; however , what men meant or might mean was the singular topic each boisterous evening at Willard 's . The suites were caves of favor-seekers . The hallways were avenues of doubt . The public bar was a font of pride . The drawing rooms were lavish nests of ladies and their gigolos . The ballroom was less an auditorium than a circus big top . The barbershop was the stage to display one 's four-day-old , front-line beard . And the main dining room , with false vaulting arches , ostentatious plaster-ofparisdesigns , and as much drapery as at Balmoral Castle , was the voluble and absolute arena . Since the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more scheming and plotting heads , more aching and joyful hearts , than any comparably sized building in the world ; and here , in the dining room , was the aristocracy of cunning . The dining room 's high court this evening tossed up gossip of a menu of names . There was the flat soup of George B. McClellan , now resigned ( November 14 ) from the Army in the disgrace of yet another mixed defeat , though his fate was not unhappy given the influence of his supporters ( an offer of an enormous salary as president of the Illinois Central Railroad ) and the opinion that Lincoln had prevailed less in the polling places than in Mobile , Atlanta , and the Shenandoah Valley . The idle wisdom tonight was that a political victory that had depended upon combat could just as easily become a political defeat come the next battle . And there was also news of satellite figures , like appetizers , that sated palates for a time : Stanton was out of his sickbed and back breathing fire at the War Department ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seward was rumored to oppose , or perhaps merely not to support , his old adversary James Gordon Bennett of the New-York Herald as the new minister to France ; cranky Salmon P. Chase , the resigned secretary of the treasury , was said to have reconsidered his peevish disapproval of Lincoln and to be yearning for the chief justiceship of the Supreme Court ; and the ancient attorney general , Edward Bates , exhausted from years of fighting Seward and Stanton over the suspension of habeas corpus and civil rights in general , was certain to resign in disgust at any hour . And then , these hot side dishes of the roasting and boiling Cabinet dispensed with , there was the ever popular game of U. S. Grant , the blueeyed , stoop-shouldered , and openly worshipped lieutenant-general of the mightiest army ever assembled , who still insisted upon reigning from that canvas tent with carpeted floors at City Point , near Petersburg , lest he be accused of being a parlor-room commander like the reviled Henry Halleck , and lest he be caught in the merciless , chatty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eavesdropper , would have reached past all these tidbits soon enough , for he would have sensed when he entered the arena that there was only one desired dish the assembled hungered after  --  the special of the day , the week , the month , and perhaps the war . The topic was Major-General William T. Sherman and his seventy-thousand-man army at Atlanta . One could smell it thick and tart ; one could taste it like saddle of venison ; one could hear it sizzle in the hirsute or beardless mouths . " Well , what of him , then ? " said a baffled imp from State , stuttering , " Wh-wh-where ? " " I do n't make as much of Sherman 's silence , " started a slick-headed major in the sky blue of the Invalid Corps , " as I do of the Richmond papers ' silence of Sherman 's silence . " " Sir , I insist , it 's a week since the Indianapolis Journal said he was leaving Atlanta burned ! " said a gambler in the company of his card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But they retracted it , depend on it , " said a big-eared youth . A Navy officer , just back from the tedium of the blockade off Fort Fisher , said , " Fortress Monroe has confirmed Sherman 's on the warpath . " His captain shot , " But how , which way , what kind of warpath ? " " Boston is most certain when it says Sherman wears gauntlets and not kid gloves , " protested a Yankee trader , and when his partners guffawed , he added , " They say he must not fail to level behind what he ca n't protect ! " " Hot words , I 'll grant , hot words , " laughed a financier.  |p281A  Treasury official said , " Atlanta 's burned , or it 's not burned , or it 's seceded to sit with Jesus  --  what do we care ? " " Chicago guarantees that Sherman 's left Atlanta in three grand columns , " declared a man with a bloated face of whiskers , who saw that his speech had attracted many turned heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern states like an angel of death ! " " Nonsense , nonsense , laddies , no one knows , " admonished a retired admiral , who looked old enough to have run from the British once upon a time . " No one and not especially the Army do n't know . " " So where is he going , if he is going  --  ? I do n't wonder it is confusing , " said a foreign-looking man , who whispered to his lady companion in Italian , " They are hens about roosters . " " He shall charge and blast them to hell , that 's his aim , " allowed a tall , strange fellow . " He and his four horsemen , to hell . " " Yes , Major , what does Sherman intend ? " asked a lady like a pin in this barn full of haystacks , and trying to please she added , " Victory , I 'm sure . " " Tell us first , " said one side of the room , quoting Greeley and common sense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he might be tomorrow . " " Yes , yes , first , where is he ? " said the other side of the room , citing the National Intelligences and the obvious , " and then we can figure how long he will be there . " And eventually , the murmur was united in overfed unison , " Where is Sherman ? " and again dyspeptic , " Where is Sherman ? " and again gaseous , " Where is Sherman ? " One table at least was exempt from this gluttony of talk . Sir Henry Blondel was bent forward , and he was sweeping the tablecloth with his bare hand . His very long white hair fell from his shoulders to skim the lip of his brandy snifter . The ash from his cannon of a cigar scattered and settled behind where his hand had already swept . Oliphant was seated at an angle toward Blondel , one leg crossed over the other , and was sucking on his briar pipe so deeply that his exhale bathed the table in a broad cloud . Oliphant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slowly that it too had cooled before the waiter had cleared it away . Oliphant now studied Blondel 's bowl of chocolate ice cream as it melted . " I do hope , I do , what I 've said has helped , " continued Blonde ( . He lookedp282up to see if Oliphant was following his presentation after his small interruptionfor housekeeping . Blondel had recounted most of his biography up to the Christmas before . He had only hinted at his relationship with Narcissa , however , and therefore Oliphant thought Blondel 's next remark disingenuous . Blondel said , " About myself , about the sincerity of my affection for Mrs. Winwood . " Oliphant leaned forward and removed his pipe . Blondel might have continued talking if not for an odd disturbance at a nearby table . Four gentlemen were arranged there in relaxed camaraderie , sharing a decanter of cognac and smoking luxurious cigars . Two of them were in dinner dress like Oliphant and Blondel ; the other two were undeniably splendid in Confederateuniforms  --  gold braid , gold buttons , red sashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This pair represented a Washington phenomenon , the result of Lincoln 's General Order 126 , posted omnipresently , that permitted " Secessionist soldiers " free access in the District of Columbia , and also free food if desired , in exchange for their taking of the loyalty oath to the United States . The capital was thick with Confederate deserters and parolees . And there could have been no two finer specimens of Rebeldom than these diners . They were not young , however , and close inspection showed their bitterness . As such , they were spectacles that aroused Union officers to sputtering disgust . Also , for their own alcoholized reasons , the Secessionist quartet had taken to presenting overloud toasts to Confederatecommanders , dead and still fighting . With each new name , angry white eyes uncovered across the room , in particular from a long table of soldiers in the sky-blue dress of the Invalid Corps . Blondel and Oliphant had to pause when the Confederates declared , " I give you the memories of James Ewell Brown Stuart and John Hunt Morgan , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a back-shooting coward ! " The Confederates cheered and rattled their table . A tremor passed through the room . And then the vacuum of breathing was filled again with dry , droning voices . The Invalid Corps soldiers turned aside and huddled . Oliphant took charge of his thoughts . " Please continue , Sir Henry  --  that 's a bad business , and not going to improve . " " I 've not seen worse , " said Blondel , nodding toward the Confederates , " on three continents  --  never . The hatred of men who know each other intimately  --  never . " Blondel tucked his hair behind his ears and furled his eyebrows . The white hair did mislead about his general vigor ; he had a pink , round-checked face , and looked a man accustomed to being welcomed andp283listened to . There was also a friendly laugh and a weighty tone of steadfast compassion . Oliphant had yet to see any of the ornamental eccentricity that served as fashion among Blondel 's class of Englishmen these days . Blondel collected himself , and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winwood . My desire to see her comforted in this terrible moment . I feel I 'm not getting this right . I 'm too roundabout for this . I could profit from some of the American to-the-pointness . " " One 's heart is a roundabout thing , " said Oliphant . Blondel smiled . " You are very kind . Mrs. Winwood has been equally kind to me . When I think of her , I see her caring like a crown . " Oliphant said , " She is a ceaselessly generous woman . " " Yes , yes ! And now she has lost so many , and needs so much ! " Blondel held his hands as if they were a bowl . " I have asked myself , what can I do ? Oh , this accompanying her abroad which she makes much of , was little , the least of it . I want to do more . And need to do more . I look to you for guidance . I 've hoped we could be friends  --  after we come to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on about myself , so tiresomely . I wanted you to know that I am prepared to do whatever is asked . " Blondel tapped the table above Oliphant 's knee . " You are the last man  --  it sounds dreadful  --  the last man in the family . Dear God , forgive me . " " It is true . There it is . " " Unless , of course , this wretched news about General Winwood is incorrect , and he 's prisoner or  --  " Oliphant interrupted . " There are casualty lists and prisoner lists . I have corresponded with Richmond . It 's a done thing , Sir Henry . The Shenandoah Valley was reduced end to end . And General Winwood was lost somewhere near the Potomac , or Harper 's Ferry . The unburied dead  --  the mass graves  --  a done thing . " Blondel said , " It does take time , and is cruel either way , to announce prematurely , or to allow hope . I know . I have  --  had  --  a close friend who is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " That was the Sepoy Rebellion ? " asked Oliphant . " The massacre , Mr. Oliphant , like all rebellions . " Blondel sucked on his cigar . " Tell me , please , I am curious . Mrs. Winwood and the general were living apart ? Since the war ? " Oliphant said , " Before that . For a long time . Their situation was irreconcilable . Or so I was told . It was never anything I understood either . I never met the general , and I arrived in Beaufort nine years back . "  |p284The  Secessionists at the near table broadcasted , " I say , God bless Jubal Anderson Early , and make the waters open before him as before the Israelites , and crash on his enemies like on the godless Egyptians ! " There was a screech of chairs on the hardwood floor . Because of his July cavalry raid , Jubal Early was a hero to the legion of Southern sympathizers in the District , and was anathema to the Union supporters . In children 's prayers , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or asked God to protect them from him . A grandfatherly diner stood in the dining room and flung his dinner napkin at the Secessionists . " For pity 's sake , show some decency here . " Blondel shifted again . " You have n't asked me any questions really . About what I 've said . I could n't have done all that well . " Oliphant said , " You speak well for yourself , sir , and humbly . You 're a soldier of the Queen , as you say . India sounds to me like a dream . I have never seen a battle . I have notions of them , and dreams , but  --  not yet , thank God . It has n't happened . As to your hopes . I appreciate your sincere concern for Mrs. Winwood 's welfare . " " And yours ! And your whole family 's ! I am offering what I can marshall to help you and yours caught in this war . I 've seen the war differently this last week than I had understood it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bright debates of liberty and slavery ? What matter the rams , or the blockade ? Your country is destroying people like woodchips ! The rational thing  --  the only thing  --  is to escape ! " Oliphant said , " To save what I can , yes , sometimes I believe that . " Blondel continued , " It is right . Mrs. Winwood has told me of your family , and of Mrs. Oliphant 's heroic protection of your children , and Mrs. Winwood 's . Mrs. Oliphant needs our help too . I 'm making a botch of this . I want to help . I need your help to do so . " Oliphant started to reply , yet restrained himself to fiddle with his pipe . He relit with his dull-gold lighter decorated with the Spectre Buck . Oliphanthad the measure of this man now . Blondel was in love with Narcissa . It was not a surprise . Still , the fact of it pressed him . Oliphant thought , fate proposes , and fate disposes . And there was always more , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of this dinner was so that Blondel could bargain with Oliphant , and with his own fate , in order to win Narcissa . There were tangible and imaginary obstacles in the way of his suit , yet to Blondel they must seem inconsequential in comparison to his desire . His wife 's death had dropped him into a pit of defeat , and the opiump285dependency that he alluded to , and Narcissa had confirmed , remained a curse of his wild self-pity . But Blondel was trying boldly and honestly to climb out of his trouble . By chance , in London to mend after leaving India and retiring from the Army , Blondel had found someone spectacular , Narcissa , to grab hold of . And she seemed as needful as he . Oliphant recognized the symmetry ; he had grabbed hold of Narcissa , and she of him , in their own time and way . Oliphant saw the worth , risk , and compulsion for Blondel . He also saw the truth . Oliphant decided to confess himself , if obliquely ; he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blondel brought his chair closer , and bent his head to Oliphant 's . " Dear God , yes . I want to help you all get away safe , out of Washington , out of Savannah , out of America . I know this sounds presumptuous . It is . I am sharing my heart . You are an accomplished man . Mrs. Winwood  --  Narcissa  --  has told me of your successes , and what her family owes you for your commercial and financial prowess . I know you have lost much in South Carolina , and yet are far from being without resources . There are many avenues , now , and after the war , again  --  The cotton trade will return with brass bands . I want to help repair all the damage that you have suffered . I 've said I have three young children at home with my mother . I am free , for now , to make my own way . You must hear me . I am your servant . Oh , please , sir , if you want my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could really get them out of Savannah ? " " I have ideas , " said Blondel . " And friends in government , mine and yours . My father and brother have no small influence . I think I could muster more . We can get Narcissa to Beaufort , and bury that poor man , and then we can give it a try . We are n't old men yet , you and I. We can give it a try , John . " " We can do that , Sir Henry , " began Oliphant . Blondel threw out his hand to dismiss the formality , and mumbled " Henry . " Oliphant smiled . Blondel was offering profound fraternity . Nevertheless , Oliphant thought this conversationproceeding too quickly in one direction . His instinct was that it was too soon to seal a bargain for Narcissa , or for himself and his family . Oliphant equivocated . " You  --  Have you told Narcissa about Savannah ? " " I did n't  --  could n't  --  promise . It seemed boastful , and cheap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far in our discussion about our future , about hers , for her not to have been consulted . " Blondel said , " I have worried about this . I have hope , I have reason to hope , that she would hear my appeal as fairly as you have . And with the addition of your approval , I have special hope . "  | " So you have spoken to Narcissa about your affections ? " Blondel laughed . " I 've done my best . Yet , as you say , the heart is a roundabout mechanism , and she is an intimidating woman . " Oliphant smiled in return . But it was pretense . He was touched by fears as if by invisible hands . To lose Narcissa ! To gain Camellia ! To lose America ! To gain peace ! And the threat and the promise and the reward and the sentence were all consequent upon shaking the hand of this man , Blondel , who did not know the whole truth , who could not guess the most shameful and yet most crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did decency demand ? What did love command ? Oliphant felt spontaneously pulled backward and pushed forward by his intelligence . He also felt that his own heart was suddenly a secret to him . Oliphant steadied himself , and tried to plunge ; he began , " I do n't know , I do n't  --  " He sighed . How could he do this ? How could he not ? He said , " Henry , I am a prisoner of my circumstances . " " Please , John , I have guessed . I know some , about your service , about Richmond . " " No , no , " said Oliphant , and then he stopped . " You do ? " The Secessionist quartet and their adversaries interrupted again with anotherunhappy and this time stunning distraction . The youngest companion of the paroled Confederates stood with his glass held high like a torch , and tried to outdo the gods of war . " Brave soldiers of the Confederacy , I propose a toast to the greatest warrior and most honorable American and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant  --  a giant of irreproachable might , a giant to sweep the devils aside with his left arm while with his steely and unbent right he punishes the tyrants who make war on women and children and burn out the homes of the innocent and steal the food from the destitute , in brief ! In brief ! I give you ! I give you ! Robert E. Lee , the heart of the brave , the soul of the free ! God Almighty keep him safe ! " A thick wine glass flew from across the room and just missed the speaker to bounce on the floor and crack against the back wall . The dining room was half empty now for the theater hour . The remaining pontificators and heavy drinkers were gathered mostly in the inner circle of tables . The crash of the glass stilled them like the first sky burst of a barrage . The Secessionist speaker took two drunken steps backward without turning his gaze from the direction of his adversary , and in slow motion he raised his leg to smash his boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smote the damn Yankees ! " Hisp287other civilian companion cheered , " Hooray for Dixie ! " The two parolees watched the charade in anxious anticipation . They were unprepared for the new attack . A man of indeterminate age , shrunken inside his baggy sky-blue uniform , crossed the floor to the Secessionisttable with the speed of a charger at a rampart . He had a cane . He hobbled twice more as he raised it . He crashed the cane down on the table , and then down again on the back of one of the Confederate parolees . The victim toppled onto the table , dragging glasses and dishes atop himself as he fell to the floor . The Invalid trooper set himself again  --  to kill . Murder was clearly in his face , his teeth bared and eyes squinting shut . The other parolee intervened , grappling with the attacker . The Invalid trooper screamed , " Goddamn ye , Rebs , goddamn ye to hell ! " The bystanders were in a frenzy . There were cries of " Stop ! Stop ! " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect their comrade . There was the fright and then the anger of the civilian diners . The undamaged Confederate acted badly , because ambiguously  --  he restrained the attacker , but he also shook him in a belligerent fashion , shouting , " No , no , what 've you done ? You 've killed him ! " The Confederate then saw his peril , but was unable to save himself as he was clubbed down by another cane-wielding trooper . The aged admiral got across the room to insert himself between the contestants . " Enough ! Help that man there , and belay that ! " This might have stopped the fight . But when the first victim was rolled over , his face was smeared in gore . The original speaker knelt down to clean his dinner companion 's face , and then looked up at the two assailants . " In the back , that 's your mettle , cowards , back-stabbers ! " Vile screaming followed , and another surge . By this time , Blondel had escorted Oliphant toward the exit , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks , waiters , and lobby patrons cascading into the room to watch . Oliphant bounced off a large captain of cavalry who then fell down heavily because he had been on canes . But Oliphant was unable to help the cavalryman up because of the crush . Oliphant hid behind a pillar and looked back at the riot . There were men drawn up at smashed tables . Some were staring at each other 's clothes to try to establish friend or foe ; others were breaking up chairs for weapons . It would not be a quick battle , because one could assume there were more than enough Southern sympathizers in the room to test the Union soldiers . Oliphant saw one little nugget of a man sneak up to draw out the saber of the wounded Confederate parolee . Many screamed and gasped ,  |p288because  for a moment it appeared that this was an assassin who intended to hack like a John Brown manque . Instead , the sneak only tried to break the blade over his knee , and failed , dropping it with a howl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbing heads that Oliphant could not see the central contest . He could only hear the whine of peacemaking and the barks of provocation , " Traitors ! " " Blackguards ! " " Shame ! Shame ! " Oliphant reached the lobby and found Blondel again . They walked around each other for a few moments , starting sentences and then glancing away to calm themselves , and always keeping their attention on the dining room . Finally the hubbub did subside , and without shots or further injuries . Diners began coming out in groups , some with food smeared on their coats . Their expressions were neither angry nor resigned , more as if they were close to weeping . Oliphant saw one coatless fellow who proceeded to rip off his own shirt . Blondel took Oliphant 's arm and ushered him toward the public bar . Blondel made a fluttery motion with his fingers , and said , " Savage , bloody savage . I have seen nastier , when these savages came down on us with spears , and us with our Napoleons . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right fist to his mouth , and mumbled into it , " Soon we shall be down to teeth and nails . " LATER WEDNESDAY EVENING , NOVEMBER I6The riot at Willard 's darkened Oliphant , and soon after he excused himself from Blondel 's gentle company . He left not only an unfinished cognac but also an unfinished confession . Blondel bade farewell at the bar . " I shall wait upon you , John , and your direction . " Outside , the night sky had grown big with the breakup of the overcast . The moon was so bright , four days short of full , that the Milky Way was overwhelmed with moonbeams . Oliphant found the North Star as he pulled on his top hat . Its certainty purchased him some comfort . It was colder now , and a determined wind ruled Pennsylvania Avenue , bending the long line of ailanthus trees , scattering the leaves in small cyclones , whooshing so strongly that it often drowned out the muck-sucking trot of the passing horses.  |p289Oli|phant  climbed into a two-wheeled hack that presented itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was distracted by the upcoming lights of the Treasury building at the West Fifteenth interruption of Pennsylvania Avenue . The gas illumination gave a blue patina to the beige facade . Oliphant knew the bright windows behind the columns  --  this was a neo-classical temple of money  --  were for the Counting Room , where they would be as usual working all night to tally the greenbacks . There would be companies of Treasury women there , bent over the long tables , with green eyeshades and inky fingers . This image produced another . He pictured Narcissa , Camellia , Laura , and his own daughters , Alice , Mary , and Faith , and Narcissa 's daughters , Sophy and Martha . And then he saw Narcissa again : how she would be when he arrived home , downstairs in the conservatory , before the bier . Maum Rosemarywould be after her to come in from the damp . Narcissa would say , " After a while , Maumer , " and return to her reading . And when he came in , he would sit beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we try tomorrow ? " Oliphant rocked forward and shouted through the speaking window in the sedan top . " Driver ! Listen here ! We must go back ! " He had been selfish and irrational . His primary goal must be to bury Granby Royall . He shouted , " Back to Willard 's , now ! " It was some time , however , caught in the traffic at Lafayette Square , before Oliphant 's hack arrived back at Willard 's and waded into the tangle of hacks at the curb . By then , Oliphant was resolved to bargain as openly as necessary with Blondel . And if the price were the truth about his feelings for Narcissa , he would pay what he could of it  --  he could try ! Oliphant was so committed to his course that he did not instantly recognize the tall , white-haired figure in top hat and cape emerging from the bright entrance of Willard 's . The hack slid the last few feet to the sidewalk . Oliphant had a dollar in his hand . The driver  --  a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  reached around to open the cabin door . Oliphant put the money in the man 's paw and pushed one leg forward to step out . It was then that he realized that here was Blondel again , less than ten yards away . Blondel was not alone . His companion was a portly , bow-legged gentlemanin evening dress , who had a moustache shaped into twirled points in the Continental style . The stranger moved up behind Blondel and got his attention . The bustling crowd momentarily closed around them . They reap/peared , this time laughing at something behind them . They stopped to look back at a most attractive woman in pale blue silk and a long red cape who was just then leaving Willard 's with an elderly gentleman . Oliphant did not announce himself . He watched Blondel and the stranger walk over to a four-wheeled coach that occupied the corner of West Fourteenth and Pennsylvania like a gun frigate . The stranger gestured to the driver , then opened the cab door to remove his walking cane . There was some sort of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off on foot , north on West Fourteenth . The private coach swung around to follow them . Oliphant got down carefully , and said , " Driver , I am going to walk for a while " How 's that , sir ? " said a small figure atop the hack . Oliphant looked up to the driver 's assistant  --  a dwarfish Negro in a top hat whom Oliphant had not seen before . He started again , " I would like , if you would follow me , while I walk . " " Yes , sir , happy to , sir , " said the driver 's assistant . Oliphant marched to the corner ; he waited for his hack to clear the jam-up and reach him . Forty yards on , Blondel and the stranger were walking arm in arm from one pool of gaslight to another . Oliphant tapped his cane umbrella and proceeded . Blondel and the stranger weaved through a flock of pedestrians coming out from one of the high-priced bawdyhouses , then crossed the intersection east , and then crossed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stately thoroughfare of older and grander houses that was defined in this section from the Treasury building at West Fifteenth to the Patent Office at West Ninth as Embassy Row . Blondel and his companion strolled another half block , then veered into the carriage drive of a majestic brick mansion set back from the street amid half-naked trees . The house was lit for a ball . Luxurious coaches and carriages lined the drive and the street . There was a stream of guests into both the main entrance and the door of the wing to the left . Oliphant remained on the south side of F Street to study the affair , and also to inspect the stranger 's private coach more closely . Even in bad light , the seal was a piercing icon close up : the imperial lion of Her Majesty 's government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . Oliphant returned to his hack , and asked up to the driver , " What is that house there  --  one of the embassies ? " The driver 's assistant leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , yes , sir  --  let 's figure . It 's been a few years since  --  yes , sir . That back there 's English . There 's Russia . Yes , sir , it 's the Frenchers . Unless it 's Austria , I never did know . " Oliphant handed up a five dollar greenback . " I would like you to wait for me , and there will be more . " The driver 's assistant 's cheerful assurance of obedience followed Oliphant across the street . He pushed through the coachmen and into the flock of guests crowding up to the main entrance of what was indeed the Legation of the Second Empire of France . The house itself was a three-and-a-half-story English-looking construction , with a slate roof , six gables , and three chimney banks ; the two-story west-side wing reproduced the details . Oliphant expected the interior would be the opposite of this understated facade , and was not disappointed , for this was a mission established under the Bourbons that was now the showplace of Bonapartism reawakened . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a swarm of bewigged servants receiving hats and wraps . Oliphant mixed up behind a handsome group of American couples , and inched forward . He assumed that his excellent French would help him bluff through his lack of an invitation . However , there was no opportunity for masquerade . The crush of gowns in the vestibule , the general growl of excitement in the central hall at arriving beauties , the rainbow display of uniforms from every sort of army and navy , all revealed to Oliphant that this was international pandemonium rather than Washington elitism . More important , given the number and urgent pomposity of the American merchantmen present , it was clear that the wealthy and powerful were welcome without need of explanation . And why ? Once inside , Oliphant was able to reconnoiter the packed drawing rooms and , with his polylingual talents , to ascertain the vocabulary of tonight 's sycophancy , for over and over he heard the name and its synonyms spoken in facile reverence : " Maximillian ! " " The Archduke Maximillian ! " " The fated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The heralded Emperor of Mexico ! " " The new wearer of the Crown of Montezuma ! " " The Savior of the Mexican Empire ! " " To his Excellency , Maximillian , and his beautiful Empress , Carlotta ! " " Long live the Emperor of Mexico , the Catholic Champion of North America ! " Oliphant took a glass of champagne and continued his tour . The specific ambition of the assembled , once revealed , did not amuse him . The French ambassador Monsieur Mercier was entertaining in order to introduce his twop292special guests , a pair of Mexican aristocrats . Until recently , it was said , the two barons had been resident in Spain , in exile from revolution-torn Mexico . Now , they were in Washington City on behalf of Mexico in order to collect the proposals and contracts of American investors for the so-called renaissanceof their country . Bluntly , this meant that Maximillian 's new imperial government in Mexico City was shopping for weapons , and railroads . The French embassy was illuminated like a covered bazaar , and the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oliphant was able to correct his first assumption that all of the capital 's society was represented . The United States government was absent in the extreme . Over there , by the painted screens , there were British Navy swords and Prussian Hussar boots and the beards of Spanish chevaliers , but there was no blue dress uniform of the United States Army ; over there , by the porcelain display of memorial plates , there were diamond-studded Brazilian and Austrian and Italian popinjays , but there were no emissaries from the State Department . And over there , quaffing wine as if it were air , there was a squadron of Continental fortune hunters like starlings encircling the bejeweledand garlanded American wives and their ripe daughters , but there was no senator  --  Republican , Democrat , or Copperhead  --  and perhaps even no congressman , though perhaps there were , given the House of Representatives ' reputation for contrariness . And why was France 's sponsorship of Mexican agents anathema to Lincoln , Seward , and the Congress ? The answer was a mountain range of intrigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they would and must obey , for the moment , Lincoln 's dictum , " One war at a time ! " Meanwhile , France 's emperor , Napoleon III , had maneuvered to place Maximillian , the younger brother of Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria , on the so-called throne of Mexico . This had been the capstone of three cynical years of international opportunism , and it looked to reestablish Catholic imperialism and reactionaryism in North America . The more he walked among them , the more this gathering disgusted Oliphant . Worse , the more it all shamed him , because for most of his last three years he had done the bidding of a Confederate government that had conspired with Napoleon III in his crude Mexican endeavor in the hope that Richmond 's collaboration would win diplomatic recognition from France . Oliphant 's duties for Judah Benjamin had taken him again and again into Paris , to John Slidell , the Confederate commissioner whose job was to stroke Napoleon III and his inner circle of greedy , backboneless aristocrats . Thep293details were immense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Napoleon III 's libertine clique and the Confederacy shared the same banker in Paris , the French Jew , Baron D'Erlanger ( whose son had married one of Slidell 's daughters ) . The further sad fact , for Oliphant , was that Jefferson Davis and Judah Benjamin were willing to concede to Napoleon III fully half of North America , from Honduras to Oregon , if such a fantastic concession would win French support . Oliphant knew there had even been talk of the so-called gradual emancipation of the South 's slaves if that political stroke could overcome Europe 's distaste for the Confederate cause . Oliphant had watched and participated in a series of questionable plays in the last year , as Davis and Benjamin struggled to offset the losses on the battlefields with theoretical giveaways in diplomacy in the future . How it appalled Oliphant to consider what must have been the contents of the notes he carried to Paris . How it tormented him that these people tonight , these European aristocrats , were supposedly more his allies than not , and that they were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Oliphant raised his glass in the direction of Capitol Hill . God save America ! God bless Lincoln and Seward for standing up to Paris , Vienna , London , Madrid , and Berlin ! Europe 's ruling class was mightily intimidated by the potential strength of America , and the actual potency of its warfleet , even an America fractured by civil war and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy because of the size of its debt to European money-lenders like Prussia . Napoleon III was a whining , whoring , lying thief ! Francis Joseph was a bloated , fratricidal coward ! And Oliphant thought no better of sly Palmerston of England and brutal Prince Bismarck of Prussia for standing by like buzzards , waiting to pick off what they could should Napoleon III and Francis Joseph I , arrogant and distrustful allies , either succeed or fail in Mexico . And Oliphant the American knew that nothing would more please the most dangerous of the lot , England , than to have America split apart permanently , first by the Confederate rebellion and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flunkies like Maximillian . Palmerston had pontificated , " Britain has no permanent friends or enemies , but only permanent interests ! " And again , when liberally disposed and Protestant England was faced with the possibility of Europe 's Catholic and reactionary regimes actually constructing a reactionary tyranny in the world , Palmerston had said , " England does not go to war for an idea ! "  |p294And  so while the buzzards of Europe circled , Mexico writhed . In 1861 , a joint military expedition of Britain , France , and Spain had toppled the liberal and reform-minded republican administration of Benito " The Indian " Juarez by landing troops on the Mexican coast under the pretense of only wishing to collect on outstanding debts . In 1862 , Britain and Spain had withdrawn from the debt scheme , yet France had remained and reinforced in order to make deliberately humiliating demands upon Mexico City . In 1863 , France had ordered its lancers to attack , and they had easily captured Mexico City and driven out the last of the republicans in order to welcome back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Archduke Ferdinand Maximillian of Austria , the kind-faced , well-intentioned , but imperially ambitious younger brother of Francis Joseph I , had arrived at the old , vermin-ridden Spanish palace in Mexico City in order to be crowned emperor of Mexico . Maximillian had immediately begun writing letters : to Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil to propose an alliance of Catholic empires ; to President Jefferson Davis of the Confederate States of America to propose an alliance of neighbors with the buffer state of Texas between them ; and to President Lincoln of the United States of America to propose an alliance of a fledgling power with a beleaguered one . It was a matter of quiet pride to Oliphant that while Dom Pedro returned Maximillian love notes , and Jefferson Davis returned Maximillian duplicitousfelicitations , Abraham Lincoln , the republican stalwart whom Europe decried as a backwoods ape , and as the missing link , refused to open Maximillian'sletters . Instead , Lincoln sent private word to Benito Juarez in hiding in north Mexico that truth and democracy would always prevail , and that he should hold out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotting was beginning to take hold , for here were his French allies conspiring to woo America to this new and ersatz Empire of Mexico . Juarez was said to be desperately pressed in the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains with fewer than two thousand diehards . No less than Horace Greeley was writing editorials hopeful that Maximillian would first renovate Mexico and then proceed to annex the remainder of Central America to reform the corrupt governments  --  the mad dream of the Knights of the Golden Circle come round once more ! And here , several hundred yards from the White House and the State Department , America 's financiers , merchants , and railroaders were flirting with the minions of France and Mexico . Would the United States be seduced by such naked conduct ? Narcissap295would have said , " If there 's profit in it , the Yankees would sell buttons to hold up the devil 's britches ! " Worse to contemplate , would even irascible but pragmatic Seward himself lay down with Napoleon III in order to keep him from the Confederacy 's skirts ? Would even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oliphant sighed , and thought , What do I care any longer ? Let these warmongers strut their phalluses ! Let these gold tarts lift their petticoats ! Let them coo of Lincoln I , Emperor of Africa , and Jefferson Davis , King of Cotton Mouths , and Maximillian , the Archdupe ! Oliphant the American had soiled himself in their bedcovers long enough , and was done with them ! He was furloughed or retired or deserted or forgotten from the Secret Service , or any other kind of bidding ! What matter their intrigues ? I quit ! " Sauve qui peut , " the French would have said  --  Save what you can ! Tonight , Oliphant agreed . He was here for other game  --  to protect his heart and to search out secrets . Oliphant found Blondel on the second floor by a gilded mirror outside the ballroom . He was standing with his companion , the dapper , portly gentleman whom Oliphant could now reasonably suppose was an English diplomat , perhaps the Jew whom Narcissa had mentioned . The receiving line wended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oliphant squeezed through the line and then hung back , to watch Blondel and the Englishman watch the reception . Inside the ballroom , a string quartet played unobtrusively beneath the chatter of the audience that lined the walls while the French ambassador and his charges d'affaires , two silvery characters with the ease of fathers carving roasts at Sunday dinner , and the Mexicans , two matched conquistadores dressed like peacocks , conducted the music of diplomacy  --  an operetta , certainly , a whirling overture followed by a grinningfirst act . And here were the American voices straining in their toneless French salutations , the Yankees as usual both eager and awkward at courtliness . Blondel and the Englishman laughed at the spectacle when yet another pear-shaped American introduced himself by imitating a Continental bow , his legs twitching , and then turned to urge his female companion and two daughters to perform the curtsies that predictably made them wobble and fall two short steps backward . Oliphant thought , Oh citizens ! But then he bricked up his censure . He tried to remain hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet to slide as close to Blondel as possible . He meant to eavesdrop . The roar of the general flattery was too much . He was just puzzling what to do when Blondel and the Englishman jumped across Oliphant 's field , within ten feet , to approach the very same beauty in the pale blue gown whom they had admired at Willard 's . Oliphant retreated down the narrow hall that connected to the front of the house . Blondel and the Englishman spoke to the beauty with such animation that Oliphant suspected romantic intrigue . She was slanty eyed and tallish , with a thin neck and large bosom , and with curlicued light brown hair . In order to show off a vivid diamond necklace , she wore a low-cut ball gown that incompletely covered her breasts and hid even less when she pushed up against the Englishman to laugh easily . " Monsieur Oliphant , yes ? " Oliphant pivoted in surprise to a diminutive man in the light blue uniform of the French Navy . He was ruddy faced , gray-bearded , round-shouldered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? London , last year ? Captain Cook ? " Oliphant relaxed  --  the Cook enthusiast ! " Of course , Max , I 'm sorry  --  Captain ? " " I was not so encumbered then . The buttons should not annoy you . I hope not . I said I was more than I wanted to be . " Oliphant spoke in French . " We parted friends , and meet again the same , Max . " Millerand replied in French . " Excellent , John , excellent . " Millerand was ignited in his own language . " We must do for the shortage of wine hereabout . To annoint our reunion ! Come with me , we have a little private party out of the way . If you are alone ? " Oliphant glanced back at Blondel , shrugged in his most Gallic imitation , and permitted Millerand to escort him to the front of the house . There was a lengthy corridor hung with oversized oils of heroes and guarded by inconspicuous three-legged tables , each supporting Oriental statues or painted porcelain clocks  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all meticulously showing 9:40 P.M. Millerand opened a door at the end of the corridor that led to a small stairway up to a servant 's landing , where he knocked once on another smaller door and then stepped into a quiet , warm , tobacco-rich chamber . Of several men on sofas , one young one popped up , and Millerand waved him at ease . They were all comfortable in their unbuttoned coats and loosened tics , arranged about a low cherry-wood table that was covered with towering green magnump297bottles of champagne like a magical glass city . They were also well along a tourist 's journey of woozy speculations about the American women in the house . Millerand introduced Oliphant as " my fellow Cook scholar , " and the welcome by the others was genuine . Oliphant sat while Millerand identified each of the drinking companions : a shiny nosed junior naval officer ; a brooding gentleman with a bald spot and cavalier 's boots who looked about Millerand 's age ; and two young gentlemen appearing to be military men dressed this evening as innocent raconteurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " continued Millerand , pouring Oliphant a full glass ; he also offered the cigars he had procured just before discovering Oliphant  --  " First class , rolled by monks ! " The others laughed , and returned to discussing their bashful plots to find romance soon enough . Millerand spoke to Oliphant . " You are the only American I know in America , I think . We are just arrived in Baltimore , and everything is fantastic , fantastic ! Is the magnificent Mrs. Winwood in Washington with you ? And the dashing Mr. Royall ? What parties they could give , not like this fortune-hunting folly . " Oliphant replied with enough of the facts about Narcissa to provide continuity . Millerand was sincerely grieved at the news of Granby Royall , and roamed at length with his thoughts about the death of a beloved parent . It was the same sort of exaggerated philosophizing that had first attracted Oliphant to Millerand in London and afterward , when they had revealed their mutual fascination with the great navigator , Captain James Cook , R.N. , F.R.S . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthplace , to the British Museum , and to the Admiralty 's record offices . Oliphant had suspected that Millerand the French hobbyist was also a French secret agent , though seemingly not one dealing directly with Confederate matters . Oliphant had also assumed that Millerand knew him as a Confederate agent . Their comaraderie was a happy accident in the sea of spying that flowed from London to Paris , Vienna , Berlin , and St. Petersburg . They had never spoken of their official duties ; they had been too busy debating Cook 's second voyage to the edge of the Antarctica ice pack , or speculating about Cook 's third voyage and why he had defied the Hawaiians who had killed him , or dreaming aloud of the day in the future when they could escape their lives and run away to the South Seas to explore paradise for themselves . This meeting tonight was the obvious result of their inability , as of yet , to flee their responsibilities . Oliphant did not think this sad . To have suchp298a dream was a joy , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was revealed for what he wanted to quit , a French naval officer on unattachedand mysterious service in America ; and Oliphant was equally uncovered , as a most inexplicable Southern agent wandering his enemy 's camp in evening clothes , and alone . Millerand poured Oliphant another brimming glass , and the two drank silently for a time , avoiding further talk of death . Oliphant puffed on his pipe , and Millerand twirled his cigar , both listening to the young Frenchmen'sstories . One of the naifs , Charles , declared he was ready to meet the enemy and would Bertrand come along ? Millerand leaned over to Oliphant . " I hope these seadogs do n't worry you with their fantasies of conquest ? They have been told that the Puritan woman is tough . I should remind them that like the finest of grapes , what is tough on the outside , so , when peeled , the inside  --  " Millerand rolled his whole face . The young naval officer , Jongleur , guffawed so hard that he rolled half off the sofa . Oliphant returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as various as the French , but from what I know to be true , it is as ready for harvesting in its season as any , and brave , and smooth , and ages well enough to make drunkards of us all . " This gained unanimous applause , even the moody chevalier joining in heartily , and the room of strangers became a clique of celebrants . " L'amour ! La femme ! La vie ! Le guerre ! " The bliss required more toasts to the young gentlemen , Charles and Bertrand , as they departed for the front . Soon after , Jongleur went in search of more wine , and Millerand discarded the vocabulary of double entendre to broach the topic of the real war , and Oliphant 's jeopardy . He began delicately , less curious than hopeful . " You have not spoken , John , of your family . They are safely out of the South ? " Oliphant winced . Millerand added , " Safe , nevertheless , safe ? " " The blockade is impenetrable , Max , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with good friends , and well stocked . " Oliphant decided not to pretend . " I do worry though . I 've not seen them since Easter last year . " Millerand said , " How wretched for you  --  and them . " Ensign Jongleur came in the door . The music outside was raucous ; there was male singing from up the stairwell as well . They poured themselves more wine . Oliphant was surprised when the melancholy chevalier , MonsieurPaul Fresque ( whom Jongleur inadvertently called " Captain " ) spokep299up , " My sympathies , Monsieur Oliphant . Might I ask where your family resides ? " " They are in Savannah , Georgia , do you know it ? " " Savannah ! " burst Jongleur , but then he pulled back and mumbled , " Excuse me , excuse me . " " No , go on , what is it ? " said Oliphant . The three Frenchmen stiffened . Oliphant strengthened his voice . " Do you know something about Savannah ? Is it yellow fever ? " Millerand said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed . " Jongleur continued to apologize . Millerand held up his hand , and said , " We have many wild reports . But then , this is politics . I am sure you could hear delirious talk about Mexico City tonight . " Oliphant said , " War is not politics . I do n't believe that . " Fresque said , " It is , sir . Life is politics , and so is death . We are each helpless when opinion changes . We must do the bidding of the mob , or at least the mob of the powerful . " Oliphant said , " That might be true in Paris , or Mexico . In my country  --  in this country  --  war is murder , and endless killing , and meaningless death , and destruction that will degrade for a hundred years . War is the devil . Civil war is hell on earth . " Millerand said , " My friend is a religious man  --  a Protestant idealist . " Ensign Jongleur tried timidly , " America is said to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me an apostate , and a fool . " Fresque blew out his cheeks . " You are in good company with us . It interests me , though , that you search for meaning in politics . It is like looking , eh ?  --  for a theme in wine . " He drank from his glass and kissed the air . " Wine is happiness . Politics is unhappiness . Why not ? War is the lusty face of the misery of politics . Exciting ruin ! Erotic carnage ! There is a symmetry for the age . And we do not need to invite in the priests to tell us when to do which . We march from city to city  --  drinking and cursing and dying . " Millerand gestured with his cigar . " If John is a pious dreamer , you , Paul , are a sentimentalist . And a soft-headed cynic . " Fresque nodded in agreement . Millerand added , " I shall remind you of your neat equation , however , when you are next too gloomy to come out of doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm sorry , I understand your delicacy on my behalf , and  --  " Oliphant took hold of the table . " If you do know about Savannah ,  |p300anything  at all , it is profoundly important to me that I learn what I can just now . There is an Englishman , a retired brigadier , who has offered to help me get my family out of Savannah in return for my support in his suit to marry my sister-in-law , Mrs. Winwood  --  " Fresque and Jongleur leaned closer ; Millerand sighed . Oliphant continued , " He has also said that he could help get me to Beaufort , in South Carolina , through the blockade , to bury my father-in-law . Now , Beaufort is in Union control , but Savannah  --  can he do this ? I need your counsel , gentlemen . " " This English brigadier ? " asked Millerand . Oliphant named Blondel , and told what he knew of him , including the fact that he was related by marriage to Granby Royall 's widow . Perhaps Millerand had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had followed Blondel here tonight , and also spoke of Blondel 's companion , the English diplomat who might be a schoolmate of Blondel 's and a Jew in the Foreign Office . Millerand said , " The white-haired man , then . I saw him , yes , how could I not ? You were staring . And they were wooing the comtesse . Oh yes , she 's married to one of these old reactionaries we call Bourbonists  --  though she 's an heiress from Boston , Franny Jones or Brown or somesuch . I think I know the Jew too . " Oliphant asserted , " What I need to know , Max , is about Savannah . " Fresque began , " Monsieur Oliphant , Savannah  --  " " We do n't know , John , " interrupted Millerand . " I was saying , " Fresque continued somewhat crankily , " that Savannah is one of any number of cities that the American Army and Navy could destroy as a political gesture . I do n't make sense of it . I do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is mad , and my empress says Lincoln is the missing link . But they are titled republicans , eh ? I do wonder . " Ensign Jongleur moved over to whisper to Millerand , the aide to his mentor . Oliphant was rattled now , as well as dizzy with the wine . He could not properly light his pipe , fumbling with the flint piece on his lighter . He waved the lighter at Fresque , and said , " My wife gave me this as a wedding present . That is the head of the Spectre Buck . From a hunting tale in the Carolina Sea Islands . About the ten-point stag that you see the day that you are not hunting for it  --  and when you return prepared to bag it , it has vanished . I do n't know why I am telling you this . " Millerand took Oliphant 's arm at the elbow . " John , please , we have  --  I have  --  upset you . I shall repair what I can . We shall find General Blondel ,  |p301and  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ask him what he intends straight-out . " The international reception had advanced well past the simple receiving of financial propositions . The second story was littered with the clues of peccadilloes that would invite crimes of marriage come the morrow . For tonight , unhappy couples had parted in their separate quests for the grasp of love , and they had separately found devotion with strangers whose accents intimated exotic nakedness . No one believed . But pretense was an exciting altar . In the hallway , there were American redheads on footstools or French blonds on divans , their faces bent to knock against the wet noses of suitors kneeling at their feet ; there were also wagging female fingers in the whiskers of chevaliers trying to place their boots in such a way that her thigh would have to press through the crinolines and rub his knee when she attempted flight ; and there was shattered glass enough , and shed gloves and fans enough , to suppose that the scratching behind the half-closed doors was not a house cat . Millerand towed Oliphant through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss ! A stony pout ! And the illusion of larger-than-life artwork , and not drunker-than-sense humanity , was helped by the fact that the gaslight had been snuffed . Shadows reigned . Some couples carried their own candles ; others found the dark and used it . " We were more subtle in my day , " said Millerand ; he started down the stairs and then turned to observe , " But I think to myself , Max , this is your day . And scandal obtains only to sell novels . " The first floor was better lit . The little fathers of several nations were bumping up against each other in another kind of taunting . The older little mothers were petting the buffet tables , where the miscellaneous guests sounded the bottom of their longing with food tossed down like pennies . Millerand sampled a pound cake as they searched . The front vestibule was still jammed with arriving guests . Oliphant squeezed against the doorjamb to follow Millerand outside . Millerand wrapped his arms about himself because of the chill air , and tried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that his hired hack was still on station across F Street , and twenty yards away stood the Englishman 's coach ; he replied , " No , I 'm sure not . " There is one good possibility , then ; come now . " Millerand charged backp302inside , and Oliphant pursued closely . They pushed past the haughtiness of the first floor , and the naughtiness of the second , up the main staircase to the darkened third floor . Here , Oliphant was reminded of a very tired bawdyhouse weathering a gale that blew from within . Doors slammed . Voices demanded . Passions screamed . No gentleman could ignore that husky female noise . Oliphant said , " Good God , Max , is this safe ? " Millerand seemed to know his way , yet he shocked Oliphant and himself when he opened the first door . Hot pink air struck them just before they stopped to stare . Several gentlemen were arranged about a lit fireplace . There was a gown on the floor . And before the fire a voluptuous , fair woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a figurine in a music box . She had her arms behind her head and her mouth open . One could see right through the cotton , and that was an undeniably shapely dark patch at her loins . Millerand closed the door again . " We can get around the other way . " Their destination was the Ambassador 's private library  --  two cozy , booklinedasymmetrical rooms joined by a cutout archway , with a suit of French armor on guard at midpoint . Millerand and Oliphant entered through a panel that , once closed behind them , concealed the door as part of a mural . The air was orangish yellow from the well-fed fires in both rooms . The height of the two chambers was considerably lowered by the bank of tobacco smoke that hung at eye level , and stung . Oliphant anticipated more burlesque perversions . He was a moment realizingthat these voyeurs were another sort . For the larger of the two rooms was filled with straight-backed men standing or lounging about , the firelight reflecting off their hair or moustaches . Oliphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a circle of chairs drawn up to a hexagonal table near the Ambassador 's dainty desk . There , like gamblers , well-groomed military men hunched forward while tall seconds peered over their shoulders . Because of the dimness , and the single oil lamp on the table , the blue , green , white , red , and gold uniforms in the chairs seemed to be headless and to move as if without bodies in them . Regardless , an excited argument proceeded indifferent to the coming and going of observers . " Do n't instruct me , General , how Grant envies Sherman 's talent to flank march ! " boomed a voice . " This would be Sherman 's last folly ! To divide a successful army and to wade into enemy territory without hope of resupply until the sea ? It is not a bold risk , it is insane ! " The speaker at the table was Germanic , using rudely bent French , and he punctuated his assertion by hitting the table and adding in German , " If such a commander returned top303me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This caused deep laughter from the onlookers . Encouraged , the speaker began an anecdote about Napoleon at Leipzig in 1813 , and thereby betrayed his Prussian identity . Millerand and Oliphant pushed forward to the suit of armor . There were several women in the recesses of the room or draped on military shoulders , and Oliphant thought he saw the slant-eyed comtesse . He did not investigate further , because he was too attracted by the soldiers ' game . Stacks of half unrolled maps and empty leather mapcases were spread out on the floor or heaped on the table . At a glance , Oliphant recognized maps of Virginia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , Kentucky , Tennessee , Alabama , Mississippi , Georgia , and the Carolinas . Oliphant whispered a question to Millerand . " A war collegium ? " Millerand replied , " Reviewing the battlefields through the bottom of their decanters . " Oliphant agreed . He could also see that the war college was well along into the chronology of the war . The hexagonal table was covered with a large-scale map of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if it was their sense of humor or lack of it that had provided a box of painted metal soldiers  --  children 's toys  --  that were spilled around the oil lamp . There were tiny Hussars with sabers raised , tiny Lancers at the charge , tiny bear-hatted Imperial Guardsmen on the march . " General , let us keep to the issue , " began a Frenchman across from the Prussian ; he placed two toy Hussars at north-central Georgia , and continued , " Here is Sherman at Atlanta . Jefferson Davis has two effective armies in the field . General Hood 's here , one hundred miles west of Atlanta "  --  he placed a toy Imperial Guardsman at the juncture of Tennessee , Alabama , and Georgia  --  " and General Lee 's here at Richmond and Petersburg . "  --  he placed another two Guardsmen in Virginia  --  " We can discount Lee , because Grant has him immobile in the trenches. "  --  he placed eight assorted soldiers in an arc like a crescent moon around southeast Virginia  --  " So , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deep South is uncoveredbefore Sherman . If Sherman were to split his army like this "  --  he took one Hussar  --  " and send a corps into Tennessee to protect Nashville and Chattanooga and the railroads from Hood , then there is nothing to prevent him from marching the rest of his army south , or east . " The Prussian protested , " Nothing except that his men ca n't eat when Hood cuts the supply line behind him . " Oliphant saw a flash of jowly white whiskers ; the Prussian was old enough to have been at Waterloo , and indeedp304began another anecdote about Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow . The Frenchman waited for the Prussian to finish , and then said , " The question before us , General , is which way will Sherman go , not if ! " He was thin-faced with gray hair like feathers about his bald plate , and he showed small white teeth . Another Germanic voice said , " Why should n't Sherman winter in Atlanta ? He is fortified , and well provisioned . Why go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leaned into the light , Oliphant saw what he presumedwas the uniform of an Austrian cavalryman , a genuine Hussar , with very striking scars and heavy eyes . He added , " Sherman can send out a corps to block Hood , I agree , that could be reinforced from Nashville . And in the springAn unseen figure contributed , " Sherman can not wait because Lincoln must win this war before his inauguration in March or suffer bankruptcy . If not , there wo n't be a nation worth ruling . Only debtors , beggars , possibly anarchists . " The aged Prussian barked in French , " Diplomacy and politics , wunderbar ! I am to believe that Grant would risk his best fighting force because Lincoln is afraid of his own people ? This is n't Mont St. Jean  --  there wo n't be futile charges here ! They have been fighting for three and a half years . Sloppy soldiers but magnificent fighters , like Sherman 's . They lust to fight ! " Oliphant was not surprised to see Blondel 's white hair dangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comtesse , and now he sat on the arm of a chair to lean to the Prussian ; he said , " I must disagree , General . The Americans are sick of the war , and hate it so much they will do the unthinkable and risk the impossible to end it . That is why Sherman shall leave Atlanta  --  now , immediately , if he has n't already as the rumors say he has . He has wasted weeks chasing General Hood . Now he will apply himself in force and risk his army for one wild opportunity to destroy the South this coming winter , so that the South can not fight again in the spring . " " Yes , exactly , " said the Frenchman , " the unthinkable , Sir Henry . " " I suggest Mobile . " The Austrian picked up the toy Hussars . The junior officers pressed closer to learn what they could of the Habsburg talent for grand marches . The Austrian instructed , " Sherman will block Hood . And abandon Atlanta . And make a long sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to besiege Mobile overland , and link up with Admiral Farragut 's fleet . The advantage is that it would draw Hood to battle . And if not , if Hood were able to outfight Sherman'sp305blocking corps , Sherman 's main army could still get back to protect Tennessee . The disadvantage for Sherman is that it will be necessary to march over 300 miles in enemy territory . But we have seen Sherman cut free from his supply lines before , for the overland march at Vicksburg last year , and for the march on Atlanta last summer . He knows how to forage . He will eat Alabama . " The Frenchman said , " I applaud the method , General , but not the cuisine . " The laughter was raucous . A junior officer asked , " How do you mean abandon Atlanta ? " The Austrian replied , " He would have to destroy it  --  the railroads , the warehouses , the defenses , so it is useless to Hood if he were to reinvest it . That is the rumor , yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civilian , silver-maned and longfingered , looking to be a diplomat , or perhaps a military attache for the ribbons on his lapel ; also , his French was too perfect . Oliphant suspected Danish or Russian . The diplomat moved the toy soldiers from Atlanta to Andersonville , in south-central Georgia , where , he said , Sherman could march to free the starving thousands of prisoners of war in a camp there , a most popular victory for Lincoln . Then , he said , Sherman could march to the coast , either due south to Pensacola , Florida , or east to Fernandina , Florida , both seaports under Union control . He added , " The commandants on the coast could send out wagon trains to meet Sherman 's army . " The diplomat 's discourse was generally approved by the other diplomats present and generally disliked by the old soldiers . Men challenged each other 's common sense in several languages , including Russian . The crowd circulated , refilling glasses , congratulating spokesmen as if they were jousting champions . Oliphant was sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the war collegium and back to the comtesse . Oliphant could now see the portly Englishman standing beside the comtesse at the ambassador 's desk . Oliphant alerted Millerand . Millerand studied the Englishman , and whispered , " Yes , John , I know him . That is Isaac Keats , of the Foreign Office , in a fashion . Your General Blondel has powerful friends . " " He 's an agent , then , " said Oliphant , " of major influence ? " " We are agents , my friend . Isaac Keats is a spy , and notorious for a winter in St. Petersburg during the Crimean War . " The Prussian was hammering again at the folly of Sherman dividing hisp306army . Sherman must winter at Atlanta , he said , and then destroy Hood in the spring , while Grant reduced Lee . Winning wars , he said , meant killing soldiers , and not roaming from village to village like post riders . The Frenchman countered that the Union had wasted three years trading the Confederacy man for man on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lee had slaughtered each other 's armies like stockyard butchers , and to what end ?  --  exhaustion in the works , ruinous morale in the ranks . The Austrian insisted that the capture and holding of cities like Montgomery , Alabama , was crucial , because it demoralized the enemy population . The diplomats repeatedly stressed that Lincoln did not have the leisure to march his armies over great amounts of territory in the hope the enemy would lose heart , nor did he have time to wait for a spring resolution to the Richmond and Petersburg stalemate : Lincoln must win the war soon , somehow , miraculously . There was shouting at the suggestion of a so-called miracle . " This is military science ! " " This is n't a crusade ! " " Why not sue the pope to intervene then ? " " Excuse me , gentlemen , " spoke up a new voice in a broad , twangy French , " from what you say , there is only one route for General Sherman . " He was a medium-sized , fair man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner dress . Oliphant had thought himself the single American present ; however , the man 's inflections and manner indicated a polished Yankee . When the Yankee took an empty seat and picked up a toy Imperial Guardsman , Oliphant saw that the man 's left cuff was pinned up for a missing hand . The Yankee continued , " General Sherman must march east . That is what you have overlooked . For Charleston , and damn the cost ! And at Charleston "  --  he placed the toy soldier on the Carolina coast  --  " he must besiege the city and reduce it . He must shatter the foundations of the rebellion . He must feed the Fire-eaters their own fire . And salt the fields , and poison the wells . Charleston , gentlemen , must be sent to hell . " The Frenchman drank from his glass , and said , " I think you are serious . " The Yankee flicked over the two Guardsmen representing Lee . " If Lincoln'ddone it three years ago , after we took Port Royal , the devil 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Austrian nodded , the junior officers guffawed while waiting a witty reply . The Yankee tapped the toy soldier he had placed on Charleston the way a man might call attention to a bold bet ; he looked around for general approval to his proposal for a coup de main . Instead ,  |p307Blondel  emerged from the epaulets and braid again and sat on the arm of the Yankee 's chair . " I appreciate your zeal , sir , " began Blondel . " We have been debating military strategy , past and future . What you recommend is vengeance . " The Yankee responded , " The meaner and sooner the better for me and millions more . " Blondel said , " Very well , I shall take into account that your temperament could be the Union War Department 's as well , and shall amend our guessworkwith a compromise of all the proposals . " Blondel used his cigar to push the toy Guardsman at Charleston along the coastline and over the Sea Islands to Savannah . Then he took up the Hussars and Lancers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could block Hood with ten thousand , knowing that they would be reinforced from Nashville . Then Sherman could cut free from his supply lines , as he did in Mississippi last year . He could burn Atlanta to deny the enemy a staging area at his rear . He could then march to the sea at Savannah . He could feint to Augusta , but he would most certainly intend to go on to Savannah for resupply from the Department of the South at Hilton Head . En route , he could destroy everything of military use , especially Macon , and the state capital at Milledgeville , and the railroad . His army could live off the stores of the population , with the summer crop in now . It could be done . It would be terrible , and dangerous for discipline and morale , but yes . His chief obstacles would be the rivers around Savannah . And once at Savannah , he could offer the city sharp terms , either surrender or oblivion , because he would n't be able to enjoin a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston , indeed , for the whole of South Carolina , and north , to march up behind Lee at Richmond . " The Prussian said , " The most reckless , most risk-filled plan ever pro-posed . " The Austrian said , " And the most inspired . A masterstroke . " The Frenchman said , " Into the belly of the enemy . " A junior officer asked , " But sir , the demand on Sherman 's troops ? " Blondel said , " They are what they call Western men , from their Northwest , and very rugged . It is much the same army that Grant had at Shiloh and Vicksburg . Look at the facts . Grant fought at Shiloh with Sherman , Thomas , and Sheridan , and gunboats up from Farragut 's fleet at New Orleans . Now , two and a half years later , the same men are on hand . Grant and Sheridan at Virginia . Sherman and Thomas at Atlanta . Farragut ruling thep308Gulf .

" Another junior officer said , " I 've seen it , at Atlanta . It was not human . " Another officer said , " I was at the Wilderness , and Spotsylvania Courthouse , and I could n't believe  --  I could n't  --  " Blondel continued to the Yankee , " You would have your revenge , sir . Sherman would have his victory for all time . And Lincoln would have his Union restored at a great cost . And the devil , I suppose , would have his usual due . I do not overlook the fact that Georgia and South Carolina are undefendedcivilian populations . This is not the kind of war we in this company have been trained to fight . It is awful to contemplate what Sherman 's men might do . And if you do mean what you say about Charleston , I suppose you mean the same for Savannah . " " I mean it , damn right ! " said the Yankee in English . " The Rebs started this war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected his posture , and spoke jocularly , " Of course , they could avoid it if they 'd surrender while they still have something to eat . " Oliphant leaped forward and was speaking all of a sudden , too loudly and with too much anguish for this debate . " What kind of a man are you ? " Oliphant reached the table . " Those are mothers and babies ! Those are pensioners and invalided cripples and helpless Negroes and boys under 14 because the rest are at the front ! Sherman has tens of thousands of veterans who only know killing and plundering ! That is n't a battle ! It 's the devil 's work ! You cruel , cruel man  --  shame on you ! " Blondel was the first to recover from Oliphant 's assault ; his surprise showed on his face , but he spoke evenly . " I only  --  please , Sherman could be sleeping fitfully at Atlanta tonight . This was only a re-creation for old campaigners . Please , I 'm sorry . " Oliphant studied Blondel for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a moment of nakedness between them , and Oliphant felt his embarrassment too . The Yankee addressed Oliphant . " I did n't get to tell you what kind of man I am , there , cousin . I 'm a loyal man . I left part of me at Rappahannock Station to prove it . So what 's your stake in this ? You look like one of these foreign strutters , but you sound the damned Reb . " " Mr. Oliphant 's family is in Savannah , " explained Blondel in French ; thenJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 0 9p309he spoke to Oliphant in English , " And I beg your forgiveness , John , for myself and for all of us , for speaking so loosely at your expense . I did n't know you were here , but that is n't an excuse . I have been an idiot , John , and I 'm sorry . " The Prussian arose and spoke to Oliphant . " Mein Herr , vergeben Sie mich , bitte . " The Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliphant felt Millerand 's hand on his shoulder ; Millerand said , " I apologizetoo , John , that you should have had to learn about Savannah like this . " Oliphant felt the tears of his upset . He had experienced a momentary rage , and he pushed it back down . He swallowed before beginning again to Blondel . " Are you sure it 's to be Savannah ? Blondel hesitated , sagging a little , and then he replied , " It 's just a theory , John . " Oliphant nodded , and spoke to them all . " Thank you , gentlemen , I forget myself . I should n't have  --  Thank you for your sympathy . " Blondel returned , " It is the least we can do . The least I can do . And we must do more , much more . " THURSDAY , NOVEMBER 17 , FRIDAY , NOVEMBER 18 , AND SATURDAY AFTERNOON , NOVEMBER 19The secrecy of Major-General Sherman 's whereabouts and intentions deepened , like a spell cast over Washington City that promised renaissance even as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliphant . Oliphant quit sleep Wednesday night for lying next to Narcissa and listening to her breathing . He had chosen to withhold from her the.episode at the French embassy , and had even offered her a made-up version of his dinner conversation with Blondel . It was not like him to deny Narcissa intelligence , and it felt absurd to deceive her when there was so much trouble , but then , he reasoned , what good would it have done to frighten her too ? Yet he also knew that he could not keep the bad news from her for long . He must find a solution ! Here he had assumed that Camellia was safe and Narcissa was in jeopardy . And now ! Was Atlanta destroyed ? What mightp310Sherman do to Savannah ? There must be a solution ! And so , after passing Thursday morning staring into the flames in the parlor fire , he launched himself in search of a patchwork remedy . For he determined that he would use whatever was at hand , including his newfound European allies , both English and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embassy with Captains Millerand and Fresque . The plan was for Millerand and Fresque to interview the French ambassador in order to promote a scheme to list Oliphant 's family in Savannah as French national dependents . The hope was that the Oliphants and their relatives would then be eligible for the lists of French citizens in the South who were slated for evacuation by French warships permitted through the blockade . Such an arrangement had suited the United States and France in October at Charleston , and there was reason to believe that a mass panic in Georgia or South Carolina could move Seward to oblige Napoleon III 's ambassador again . For it was not true , as Oliphant learned , that Lincoln and Seward were uniformly hostile to Napoleon III . They were playing a difficult game expertly  --  hinting that they might recognize Maximillian 's crown in Mexicoif and only if Napoleon III continued to refuse to recognize the Confederacy . Millerand explained to Oliphant , " Lincoln sends congratulations to the Emperor on the birth of a nephew one day , and Seward recognizes a Juarezistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , it is the economy of whores  --  promising a gift that is long since given away , and then mentioning a fee . " Oliphant replied somberly , " Mr. Benjamin does no less in Richmond , and without the fee . " Fresque joked , " Ah , then he misunderstands the French  --  we like to pay for our pleasure . A priceless treasure is too much to herself , and she resents ownership . " Millerand continued with the jest . " In comparison , your Puritan women , John , bargain with what they would never sell . And they bargain for power . " Oliphant played along . " You would have me believe that America is some grand Mrs. Stowe , or Mary Lincoln . " And their laughter helped Oliphant through the long wait at the embassy , which concluded with the charge d'affaires coming down to the reception room and announcing to Oliphant with convivial Gallic ambiguity , " We shall definitely look into your application when it becomes appropriate . " John Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing than Millerandand Fresque , yet they advanced much more in terms of information and action , and genially . Oliphant again dined with the wholeheartedly fraternal Blondel , but this time they were joined by the British Secret Service agent Isaac Keats . They withdrew from Willard 's to the privacy of the club dining room at the British embassy , also on F Street , a house not unlike the French legation 's with the exception of the massive furniture and a silence rivaling the tombs of Egypt at twilight  --  heat-popping fireplaces and the low buzz of distant , noncorporeal whispers . At the table , while finishing a bottle of wine and sampling the soup , Keats listened to Blondel 's explanation of Oliphant 's problem with a kind , blank face . Keats was a cannily attractive man , wide-girthed and wiry-haired , with almost furry eyebrows and deep , heavily lidded eyes  --  in all , features that were overdrawn and potent . He smiled carefully , and spoke delicately at first in such a way that one understood he was used to being closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a luxurious , baritone voice . " I do understand , Mr. Oliphant , that Sir Henry has the highest regard for you and your family , " said Keats , " and my friendship with Sir Henry is such that I offer you my services without reservation . If , Mr. Oliphant . If you are frank with me just now , at the birth of our acquaintance , with regard to your work . " Oliphant smiled , and replied with the part of the truth he had known he would have to exchange . He recounted matter-of-factly his service for Judah Benjamin , and also Narcissa 's service . Blondel did not comment . Keats then asked a few question of clarification , chiefly about the Confederate purchase and secret fitting-out of warships at the Laird Brothers ' shipyards at Birkenhead , opposite Liverpool on the Mersey River . Oliphant was not coy , because most of the intelligence about the blockade runners was out-of-date and now the stuff of legend , especially the high drama surrounding the escape of the C.S.S. Alabama from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keats did probe pointedly for the exact names involved in the debacle of the Laird rams , the two sophisticated steam-driven ironclad warships fitted with seven-foot-long underwater spikes to ram wooden ships that the Confederate agents had tried to sneak out of England late the year before . Still , Oliphant had the impression that he was not telling Keats anything he did not already know . The dialogue seemed more Keats 's way of testing Oliphant 's sincerity to deal.  |p312Finally  , Keats said , " Then , we have an understanding . And I thank you . I also say that this matter is even more urgent than Sir Henry , last night in his dramatic cloth , presented it . Depend on it , Mr. Oliphant , your family is in profound danger . " Oliphant said , " I do understand that , Mr. Keats . Since last night  --  I have been thinking about what is most important to me . I have always tried to help others . Now  --  this might sound foolish  --  I am prepared to help myself , regardless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should say that I am ready to be reckless . " Keats spoke gently , " We really should dine first . One needs one 's supper . And then we can talk of our triangular persuasion . The soldier without his sword , and adventurous . The gentleman without his country , and rash . And the Jew without his hunger , and curious . " They laughed , and Keats added , " Shall we sample the rack of lamb ? " Keats did not pause in his discourse even through dinner , however . He possessed a vast working knowledge of Washington , and the sort of specifics of Union war plans that indicated that his sources could make every Cabinet member 's desk an open drawer . He did avoid speculations about Sherman , though he permitted a slip that Oliphant recognized was intentional  --  he named General George Thomas as Hood 's adversary in Tennessee . This implied that Sherman had indeed dispatched a corps to block Hood and that Sherman was elsewhere with the main body of his army . Keats cared little for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man might speak of a modern and unusual performance of a classical play  --  diverting , but nothing more . Keats instead concentrated on tales of the executive and congressional branches of the United States government , and their chaotic , paradoxical war aims . He had a quick opinion of every important personage : Welles at Navy was a weakling ; Stanton at War was " consumed by crusading " ; Fessenden , the new secretary of the treasury , had inherited " a nation in receivership " and was incoherent . Keats regarded Seward as " a genius with dirty fingernails  --  the product of a political system that exceeds its parts ! " and as " the slyest international statesman after Prince Metternich of Austria  --  Seward is a contemplative cock , who fights best beak to beak . " Keats thought Charles Sumner , the Massachusetts Radical Republican senator and intimate of the Lincolns , " a dangerous saint . " All this elevated quipping had a direction , and Keats came to it in his time . He compared America and its government to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had circles within circles , swirling around the surrounded pater/familias , whose strength or lack of it affected all the cousins and in-laws as well as the immediate mate and offspring . Also , the behavior of even the most distant relative , say a great-niece 's husband , could influence the head of the family . Abraham Lincoln was the father of fathers then , whom Keats said was a " rude-born Westerner , a man suited to shopkeeping and meticulouslyhonest change-making . " Nevertheless , while Lincoln did dictate , he could also be moved by the most weak-voiced entreaties . One did not have to shout , or threaten , or show gold . Lincoln really did think of himself as a neighborhood storyteller and available ear ; and so Lincoln really did hear dearest the sobbing of the meekest . Keats said , " He is a man who believes in his own parables , and who prefers children to anything just does . " Importantly , Keats said , Lincoln was not an elevated king . He was stronger than a monarch on one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was poetically fleeting , and was generally confirmed by popular ballot as extraordinary , deserving , and virtuous at some point in near time . More , Lincoln the president was so mortal as to engage the patriotic support of even his adversaries : today he ruled and tomorrow he could be gone . Lincoln was weaker than a monarch on the other hand , because he had to attend to every dark thought : each success was the people 's or the government 's ; each failure was Lincoln 's . Oliphant interrupted , " I have heard that he is very troubled . " " You underestimate by several tens of degrees , " said Keats . They had their coffee now , and had gone into the clubroom to smoke by the fire . " I should say that President Lincoln is withering . He is isolated beyond my sense of human endurance . It is grave , and concerns my government daily , and in the extreme . " Keats then stunned Oliphant by describing in detail a Cabinet meeting at the White House the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln , Seward , Stanton , Fessenden , Usher , Dennison , and the President 's private secretary , John Hay . Keats meant to illustrate Lincoln 's long-standing loneliness and defeatism , yet he did more  --  Oliphant heard in the anecdote a chief executive become desperate , and deathy . At the meeting , Lincoln asked John Hay to open a sealed presidential memorandum that he had ordered each of the Cabinet officers to sign on August 23 , 1864 , without benefit of being able to read what they were endorsing . The memorandum read , " This morning , as for some days past , it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be reelected . Then it will be my duty to , , ,  --  operate with the President-Elect , as to save the Union between thep314Election and the Inauguration ; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he can not possibly save it afterwards . " Keats recited from memory ; he added , " Seward was furious with Lincoln for having tricked him into signing such a document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been elected , would have responded , Yes , yes , ' and then would have stalled and done nothing . And the Cabinet would have compromiseditself for nothing , for all time . Lincoln was sympathetic , but blunt . He told Seward , At least I should have done my duty and have stood clear before my own conscience . . . ' Seward later told Stanton , His conscience and my country ! ' Stanton dug at Seward in return , Your country , my oath ! ' " Oliphant excitedly interrupted Keats . " I had no notion . August 23rd ? That was before the Democratic Convention ! That means Lincoln was conceding before he had an opponent ! I thought the Election was a pantomime ! McClellan was two-faced and cloddish . But this means Lincoln was ruined in August ! He meant to quit ! " Keats said , " At least , dealing with McClellan , he would have compromisedhis ambition to emancipate the slaves and restore the Union . The effect would have been the same as quitting . If McClellan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By tonight  --  there would have been chaos . " Oliphant sprang to the mantelpiece . " The war would have been over ! " " We do not have to suppose , Mr. Oliphant , " said Keats . " That memorandumhas great significance even with the present result . First , Lincoln was so unsure of his own Cabinet that he felt it necessary to trick them to endorse what they surely would have rejected if informed of . Second , Lincoln was willing to negotiate with the Confederacy in distress , as president . He believes himself bound to find peace regardless . He is reelected now , but is still of a peaceful temperament . He is n't the tyrant or blood avenger the papers , and your Mr. Davis , make him . He is the beleaguered , tormented father . Ready to help . Eager to repair . Quick for peace , and to show mercy . If Mr. Davis were to ask genuinely  --  let that thought go . " Oliphant said , " Stanton would never ! Sumner would lead a revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keats . " The fool 's gold fortunes of war did save Lincoln 's Administration . Farragut , Sherman , and Sheridan were the Republican platform in the end . And yet for all that , Mr. Oliphant , and for all the ludicrous factionalism in the Democratic party , the Republicans could only persuade just over half the electorate . It was a sweeping victory in yourJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 1 5p315Electoral College  --  by states  --  but then , only the Northern states participated . It was no popular triumph . And the people were heard . And they cried for peace . Now , Lincoln must preside . And he must do so beholden to the manner he retained his authority , and yet attendant to those cries . " Oliphant whispered , " Sherman , it 's always Sherman now , is n't it ? " " Excuse me ? " said Keats . " No , no , do n't mistake the military for the government . To win a battle , or even a war , is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blondel smiled . " From what I know , the beaten soldier is the better man . " Keats said , " Yes , my friend , yes . " The three of them paused , each in his own reflection . Keats stood up at the mantel with Oliphant . " I have another irony for you , Mr. Oliphant , and one that must guide you . In the United States government , two factions obtain tonight . You have only identified one  --  the vengeance clique . The other faction is pacific , and sickened by the slaughter and depredation . Lincoln leads it . Yes , Abraham Lincoln leads a faction that also has included McClellan , the two wicked Seymours , and the bitter Vallandigham . It is so strange a fact that it must be true . Lincoln is president because he is the premier peace-seeker of the war party . And tonight , Lincoln might be the only member of the peace-seekers . He can not rely upon anyone , perhaps not even his own wife , since she entertains Sumner routinely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-righteous appetite  --  Sumner 's caneized plans for revenge . " Blondel commented , " Now I see why we 're fretful for Lincoln . " Keats nodded . " Lincoln is alone , truly alone , and the lone man for peace , tonight . His health , his mental faculties , his sleeplessness , his hallucinations  --  I pity him . We all should . Yet paramount , he is the answer to many problems . To yours , Mr. Oliphant . " " How can that be ? " asked Oliphant . " You do n't pretend he is n't responsiblefor Sherman , wherever Sherman is . And I can guess . I know ! " Keats held up his hands , palms out . " I have told you . Lincoln must . accommodate his tenure to the forces that reelected him . It can be worse yet . Without Lincoln , God knows what Seward , Stanton , Sumner , and Wash- ! urne , all of them and their bone-rattling fury , might try . The Radical Republicans want the South made into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker each day  --  is holding this weary nation together . Such as it is . Crude as he is . Buffoon in their eyes . Lincoln stands up . The commonest commoner who , destiny 's wit , has become the father almighty . Until he isn't. "  |p316Oli|phant  turned to stare at Keats , and spoke firmly . " I must ask , what is England 's ambition then ? " " I would n't acknowledge that question tomorrow , " said Keats . " Here , tonight , in this little piece of England , I shall paraphrase my prime minister . England has neither fast friends nor foes , only fast interests . My government would not be helped by an America become destitute . " Oliphant also paraphrased . " God save America , and let it muddle through . " Blondel nodded in sympathy and looked to Keats . Keats looked to Oliphant . " Do you hear my recommendation ? " " Lincoln , " said Oliphant . " Narcissa and I must go to Lincoln , and plead for mercy . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next step was to convene all his allies in order to formulate a plan of approach . But first Oliphant knew that he had to catch Narcissa up on the affair , and he had to do so as calmly and candidly as possible . He returned to Georgetown Thursday evening to find Narcissa awaiting him at the door . He could see that she had intuited that there was something brewing , and with a very few sentences he communicated the facts and gravity of the situation . She only blanched once ; she said , " Sherman marchingon Savannah ? " Oliphant replied , " That is Henry Blondel 's thinking , and it seems well informed . " Narcissa closed her eyes a moment and stopped breathing ; she regained herself when she said , " I shall never forgive them . And I do not want to argue about it further . " Oliphant took her cold hands with his cold hands , and said , " Narcissa , Narcissa , we must look to our own now . " Narcissa pulled away and busied herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back , she said , " We shall have them all here tomorrow night for dinner , because we need to plan . " Oliphant tried , " I was thinking we could secure a room at Willard 's . A neutral site might be  --  " Narcissa closed the discussion . " Do n't be foolish , John . " Oliphant winced , but did not comment . And so , Friday morning before breakfast , Noah and Michael were disJohnOliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 1 7p317patched to deliver invitations to dinner at Louisa Granby Turning 's home in Georgetown that evening . Past dark , Blondel was the first to arrive , on horseback . He was followed closely by the British embassy coach bearing Isaac Keats and his lady companion , the comtesse , who , as simply Franny Wooster of Boston , was soon revealed as not only the eldest child of a prominent Boston foundry owner , but also the goddaughter of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts himself , the reigning silver-maned Elijah of the Senate , Radical Republicanism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarm any apprehensionabout herself , however , when she joked about Sumner , " Oh , he likes pretty things just like any other man . " Soon after , Ensign Jongleur arrived at the door to convey the regrets of Captains Millerand and Fresque . They had been called to duty that afternoon , and were even then en route to Mexico . Jongleur had delayed behind with the express obligation to deliver to Oliphant Max Millerand 's farewell note . It read : " I shall pray for you , my dear friend . And we shall all meet again in the Sandwich Islands , to ascend the volcanoes at Hawaii . And if you reach Mauna Loa first , remember me there . MM . " Narcissa and Maum Rosemary supervised the fete with an overwhelming warmth and vivacity . And yet Oliphant experienced a disturbing downturning . Narcissa 's mood , and indeed the gay spirit of the party itself , was in such contrast to the mortuary atmosphere of the day , the facts , and the MasonCoxe-Turninghouse that Oliphant found himself withdrawing emotionally from Narcissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden . He had felt it begin the night before the moment Narcissa had seemed to dismiss his counsel and concern with , " Do n't be foolish , John . " As a result , while Narcissa had raced away to confer with Maum Rosemary on her choice of chicken gumbo for the meal , Oliphant had sat silent at the parlor fire ; and while Maum Rosemary had stayed up half the night rehabilitating the Turning silverware , Oliphant had lain in bed and had been so wrenched by the clinkingsounds from downstairs that he had covered his ears ; and while Narcissahad been up early Friday morning to shop , Oliphant had left the house altogether for a walk down by the Potomac ; and , when it had come time to dress for dinner , while Narcissa had dashed through the house checking the smallest preparations , so that she had to rush her own toilet and to cry out for Maum Rosemary 's assistance with her gown and hair , Oliphant had stood beneath the great chestnut in the rear gardenp318and watched the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guests assembled , Oliphant was aware that there was further deterioration of his mood . He sat in the north-side parlor and watched Narcissa entertain her guests as a man might stare at a surprise reminder of his youth . He puffed on his pipe , and kept covering his mouth for no sensible reason . Why was he so lethargic ? What could be the cause of this dizzying sense of frustration ? Then , at a moment of loud laughter in the room , Oliphant solved his puzzle . This was a simple child 's pout . All the night before and all day , he had been pouting . But why ? He thought a moment , and guessed . He had assumed that it would be Narcissa who would resent this makeshift solution to their problems , that it would be Narcissa who would sink in frustration for their bad luck . Instead , she seemed willing to embrace every possible action , no matter how improbable , as if she were awakening from a long drugged sleep to find herself able to fly . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit , tonight she seemed transformed into an exuberant voyager . Now it was Oliphant  --  the polite , even-tempered , all-knowing Oliphant  --  who was acting the defeatist , and who heard himself snorting at kind remarks , and who saw himself being curt to the fraternal Blondel and cool to the solicitous Franny Wooster . And worse than being impolite , Oliphant knew that he was being indifferent to his own supposed best interests . For how could his gloominess help anything ? How could his poor behavior help Camellia and three daughters he had never been much of a father to ? And yet , the more Narcissa swooped and cooed at her party , the more Oliphant sank back and sighed . And why ? Narcissa 's excitement continued through the meal and filled Mrs. Turning'slong , candle-lit dining room . The mirrors that flanked the looming sideboard threw the diners ' faces about the room in such a way so that Narcissa , at the table 's head , could study her guests from several sides : Keats and Franny Wooster at her left hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her intelligence , reigning over the conversation , holding the guests together with questions and glances . Keats , once again , did much of the speechifying . But there was as much humor as sober detail , and Blondel and the comtesse would on occasion applaud some quip of Keats 's or Narcissa 's . For Narcissa was equal to Keats 's wit and perspicacity , and almost did as much speculating as he . She possessed a knowledge of Washington and theJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 31 9p319United States government that was twenty-five years out of date but rich . She grasped the military situation in Georgia and Virginia completely , so that she was able to outline a schedule that would place Sherman at Savannah before the New Year , while Grant thrashed uselessly at Richmond and Petersburg . She understood Keats 's characterization of Lincoln intuitively ; and she welcomed the proposal that Lincoln would more be influenced by honesty and charm than he would be by connivance or resistance . What did Narcissa propose ? How did she think she could approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save her family in Savannah ? Narcissa the secret agent now presented herself as Mrs. Winwood the Peace Commissioner . She drafted in the air her speech to Lincoln , and her suits to Sumner and Seward , if it came to that . She explained in detail how she would accomplish with ad hoc diplomacy what all the armies and all the intrigue had failed to achieve . For all to see , Narcissa was magnificentlyanimated in her midnight-blue gown , a woman reborn from bereaved supplicant to buoyant emissary . For she was not only prepared to secure her own family , she was also ambitious to plead the case for an armistice in order to protect her beloved South from complete destruction . Mrs. Winwood the peace commissioner intended to approach Lincoln , and then , having won Lincoln 's support , she intended to continue . There was mention of Richmond . There was talk of the persuasion of Jefferson Davis . Blondel sat at Narcissa 's arm in rapture at her performance . He leaped to her chair whenever she rose during the meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and glowed when she asked him for his arm to lead the guests to the parlor for coffee and sweets . It was the conduct of a man so dizzy with love that he was past caring how he appeared . If Narcissa had asked him to leave that night for Savannah , he would have tried , certainly he would have done . His heart was open , and it made him young . His heart was presented , and it made Narcissa bold . Narcissa 's boldness frightened Oliphant . He feared that her optimism was contrived  --  that she was not ascending to these schemes but declining to these fantasies . It was not her nature to promise and not to deliver , or to hope for the impossible . Oliphant had known her as practical , straightforward , cautious , hard-working , and very realistic . Now , she seemed otherwise  --  perhaps disoriented by the miasma that was spreading throughout the countryas the war moved into increasingly deranged violence . Was she being true to her heart ? Was she being false to her history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things when he could not evenp320be sure that it was Narcissa 's illusions that frightened him the most . Might there not be another , darker cause of his gloom  --  the fundamental reason he was pouting ? Jealousy was certainly available , because of Blondel . And guilt was always available , because of his adultery . Oliphant asked himself , What do I feel hardest and deepest of all just now ? Oliphant thought , I am angry . Oliphant realized , I am nearly in a rage . Narcissa must have seen this or something similar , because afterward , the guests gone before 11 P.M. in order to rest for the contest planned the next day at the President 's House , she surprised Oliphant by suddenly appearing in the north-side parlor , and sitting next to him on the sofa before the fire . " It went well , do n't you think ? " she began . " Issac Keats is what you said , oh my ! A genuine English spy ! And the comtesse ! They must be lovers . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after her . And Max , what a lovely man to have sent his ensign with the note . He is your dear friend , I think , and we shall pray for him too . Volcanoes ! How I would like to go to the Sandwich Islands with you ! And Henry thinks so much of you too , John . He told me so in the gentlest way . He envies you , he said , and he worries for you , and your health . I told him you 're as fit as ever . You are , are n't you , John ? You are all right ? " " I do n't know what is bothering me , " Oliphant tried . " Yes , I 'm fit . And Max is first-rate . " " What is it , darling ? No , tell me . Is it Henry ? " Oliphant shrugged . " Nothing like that . It 's tomorrow , I suppose . " " John , I am aware of Henry 's behavior , and if you ask me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , presuming much more than he has any right to . I 've told him so . I have . " " Sir Henry  --  Henry  --  I like him , Narcissa , I do . It might be easier for me if I did n't . He 's a good man , and a true man . I have n't said , about the other night  --  what it was that he wanted to discuss at dinner . " Narcissa leaned closer . " You said it was about Papa . " " Partly . It was about you , too . He was asking me about you , as the man of the family . The last man . About you . " " And what did you tell him ? " " What could I tell him ? He wants  --  " Narcissa interrupted abruptly . " Stop this . You should have told me . So that 's why you were watching us . You should have told me . Why have youJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 2 1p321started keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why he wanted to dine with you . " " Well , now you know . What do you make of it ? Of his offer ? " " And what would you have me say ? That he 's ambitious ? That he 's a troubled man , and wants much ? To me , what we want is much more important . Really , John , we have the lives of our family to worry about . What would it serve to fret for Henry 's notions  --  good-hearted or selfish ? " " You think he has n't understood that ? He has offered to help without conditions . He wants more than simply marriage . He wants to help us . He has arranged this all , you know  --  Keats and the comtesse and I ca n't guess what else tomorrow . He 's the most competent sort of man . Like I used to be . I 've seen him  --  at Willard 's the other night . And at the French embassy . The way they all listened to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And are you pressing his suit ? " " Narcissa , it 's more serious than that . He has offered to help the whole family , to relocate us , to sponsor us , to rescue us  --  " " Let him put all England at my feet ! What I want is Papa at rest , and Cammie and Laura and our babies , and Sally and Lizzie and their babies  --  are you hearing me now ? Our family , yours and mine , I want them safe . That is what is before us , to try and to do . Henry 's world is as far away as London , farther . Are you there , John ? John ? " " Yes , Narcissa , I am here , I 'm listening . " Narcissa leaned to kiss Oliphant on the bridge of his nose . " I also want you to come up with me . You ca n't sit here and fret alone , and it is so damp down here , and I do n't want to sit with you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . Do come up with me . We have much to review . And please do n't say that you 're off for another dreary walk . I need you to talk with me . I 'm stirred up , and John ? " Oliphant looked at her , but he truly was not listening . He was thinking how he might tell her that he was afraid and angry and beaten and in despair . He was thinking how he could tell her all at once that the war had been a catastrophe , just as he had known it would be , and that the South of her youth was gone forever , and that whatever their future might be it could never be happy , and that he did not want to be the person that he was , and that he was so frustrated he felt like bursting because he could not help her , or Camellia , or anyone , most especially himself . Oh , what did he want to tell her most ? ! That they were finished ! That she must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure ! That he felt closed in upon by that invisible hand , and that at any moment it might flick him into nothingness ! And what did he say ? He said the most difficult thing of all ; he said , " Narcissa , it 's that I do n't believe anymore . " " What do you mean ? Believe what ? " She took his hands , and pressed them together , and took them up to her mouth and kissed them , again and again , and said , " I love you , John Oliphant . " " I love you , Narcissa . " " You wo n't leave me ? You will stay with me tonight , and tomorrow , and forever ? I need you . I do n't know what is ahead for us . But I do know what has happened , and that without you , dear , wonderful , sweet , kind , true , true man , I ca n't think . Tomorrow is for us . You must believe that . Tomorrow , oh my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She folded herself against his breast , and held on . " Say yes , John , say yes . " The telegram from Baltimore was delivered about noon , Saturday . Everyonewas dressing for the adventure , and so Oliphant was able to get down to the front door first . When he saw the telegram was addressed to him , he did not move to open it . Whatever was inside , it could wait an hour or two . Also , Maum Rosemary was upon him immediately to ask after the bell , and then Narcissa called down . Oliphant slipped the wire into his inside breast pocket , and then he went back up to Narcissa . He did not tell her the truth . Saturday afternoon , November 19 , was cool and bright , with vast cloud banks in a single plane that seemed to heap upon themselves to form a gray and purple marble-like sky  --  slabs here or shattered pieces there , all with creamy edges . Oliphant had hired a large barouche because Maum Rosemary and the adolescents were coming along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael had asked to be excused ; in fact , Michael had communicatedthat he was not attending in such a way as to have upset Noah and Maum Rosemary  --  " Divil 's got him , " Maum Rosemary had said . Fortunately , Jimmie 's full-bodied jubilation carried the party 's spirits down Pennsylvania Avenue . Despite the cool weather , they put the carriage top halfway down so that Oliphant and Noah could help with the children 's curiosity . For Jimmie was a continual series of questions during the drive : " How big 's President Lincoln ? " " He can split rails like dey say , one swing ? " " Like me , he 's born in a log cabin like me ? " Narcissa answered yes to everything , while Oliphant provided the details . John Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 2 3p323Noah whispered to Oliphant , " Dere were n't no sleep fer dat boy las ' night , an ' won ' be dis'un . " When Jimmie chanced upon asking after the meaning of " emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Being free is forgrown-ups , Jimmie . You do n't want to leave your grandma , do you ? " Jimmie said , " If we 're free , we can all go home together , ca n't we ? " Narcissa replied , " Yes , dear . " At West Seventeenth Street , where Pennsylvania Avenue was interrupted by the carefully wooded rectangle of the executive branch , Oliphant expandedhis introductions for the adolescents . He pointed out the drab Navy Department and the auxiliary old War Department as well as the new-built and monolithic brick War Department along West Seventeenth . He was about to identify the ranks of the Army and Navy officers on the walkways when he stopped himself . Narcissa was frowning , and kept her eyes fixed on the White House in the near distance . Oliphant recognized that this was the same superstitious conduct of their five days of calling at the Navy Department : She had refused to look , and had gone inside blindly  --  her eyes actually shut  --  on Oliphant 's arm . Now , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder about her resolve . This was such a delicate plot , and if she could not face the innocuous  --  He had argued with her about this point . She had declared that the President 's House was different . She had claimed she knew it better than Mrs. Lincoln did  --  a result of all of her frolicking there at dances when she was 15 . Still , Oliphant thought , she should look at Stanton 's fortress , just once . When Jimmie asked Narcissa about ironclad ships , Narcissa cut him off . Oliphant turned back around to criticize her . And she cut him off too . " Never you mind that , just go on ahead , and Noah , do n't heed the jam-up . " Noah slowed the barouche as they neared the White House 's iron gateway . The traffic in and out was constant , and the semicircular drive was filled with expensive-looking landaus , barouches , and coaches . The president 's Saturday afternoon levee looked well under way at past 2 P.M. It also appeared that half of official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a second-class affair in comparison to the formal Tuesday evening levees . Oliphant passed the time while Noah negotiated the drive by talking to the children . Jinna wanted to know about the statue that stood in the small grassy oval before the White House . Oliphant explained , " That 's Tom Jefferson , the author of the Declaration of Independence and a co-author ofp324You see that thing in his hand ? That 's meant to be the Constitution . " Jinna and Nell both said they thought Jefferson 's statue looked moldy . Oliphant allowed that bronze still wore better than flesh , and that the real Mr. Jefferson would now be over a hundred and ten or twenty years old . Jimmie and Cato pointed to the impressive and sparkling bronze statue behind them , across the road in Lafayette Park . Oliphant explained that that was Andrew Jackson , a famous president of the United States who was born a poor boy in South Carolina like Jimmie and Cato , and who rose to fight Indians and John C. Calhoun , and to win . Oliphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat ? That 's because he 's happy to be in heaven . " The girls squealed when Oliphant began the tale of why Jackson had been called " Old Hickory . " " He was whupped ? " burst Jimmie . The plan they had worked out the night before called for Narcissa to arrive late , well after Keats and Blondel were to have approached Mrs. Lincoln and to have proffered a gift  --  a peace offering . The comtesse was also to have long since taken position with her godfather , Senator Sumner , and to have sown the rumor that an extraordinary peace commissioner was expected today at the levee . Beyond this , the plan relied upon so many variables that Oliphant thought it best to concentrate merely on getting his party inside and hoping for luck . They left Noah to attend to the carriage and walked the last yards , to the enormous columned portico of the President 's House . This was the unimpressiveside of the house , and the damage done to the grounds and facade by the army of pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backdoor appearance into a meager one . Also , a beautiful , gold inlaid coach and four stood just at the portico , its team outfitted with silver harnesses , its footman resplendent in furs and gold-trimmed pantaloons , and the coach 's presence so overwhelmed the plain , chipped , weather-worn President 's House with the trappings of aristocratic privilege that Oliphant wanted to laugh  --  more , wanted to make a speech on the juxtaposition . But his audience was too distracted , and when he saw Jimmie , Cato , Nell , and Jinna hop with awe and collectively gasp as they stepped to the White House door , his heart raced with theirs . Jefferson and Jackson really had lived here ! This was America 's first home ! He caught up with the adolescents . The small vestibule bustled with visitors , and off to the side there were attendants taking coats ; there were also huge , fur-coated servants in riding boots . Narcissa turned to Oliphant and smiled . Then she began an introduction toJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite many years of opportunity in the 1850s , had never visited . The President 's House was divided into three parts off a wide , carpeted , lengthwise hall . The right-hand , west wing was for the president 's family , and was partitioned off by bronze and ground-glass screens across the hall . The center body of the house contained the state parlors , the Blue , Green , and Crimson rooms , so-called for their distinctively colored furnishings . And the left-hand , east wing contained , on the first floor , the grand East Room , and on the second floor , the president 's offices and Cabinet Room . Narcissa also assured the children that Mrs. Lincoln had a very large kitchen in the basement . Narcissa stepped over to Oliphant . " And there 's where I was first kissed , a tall boy , like a carrot , from Virginia . " She pointed to a closed door to the right , to the Crimson Room . " And he was named Lee , I swear ! " Oliphant looked about for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in authority , not even a guard . The public was truly welcome , and also in a hurry . The hallway was so busy that Oliphant and Maum Rosemary had to corral the adolescents . Maum Rosemary said , " You hold Jim , and I can handle these'un . " Soon , though , Oliphant was being dragged forward by the hand as Jimmie surged with the crowd , and Oliphant could only beckon Narcissa to follow as closely as possible . The crush and rudeness of the assembly at the archway to the East Room stopped even Jimmie . It was a plain-dressed mob , dusty frock coats worn at the sleeves , simple dresses in flat colors  --  none of the finery of a gaslight reception . Yet it made up for its ordinariness by acting feverishly . And there were crude hellos from strangers directed at Narcissa , who stood out like a gem in her rose gown and white point lace shawl with her headdress of white velvet and lace . Oliphant closed up with her to offer protection . He was now most irritated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levee would be dull and ill-attended . What could this be ? They worked their way into the East Room . All Oliphant could see were the heads of the people and above  --  the ceiling frescoed with cupids and flowers , three chandeliers hanging like upside-down wedding cakes . There were holes cut in the damask drapery and the lace curtains , and there were huge swatches hacked out of the carpet , as if a short souvenir hunter had wandered free with a knife . Jimmie complained he could see nothing but backsides . Narcissa asked if Oliphant had yet spied l5londel . Maum Rosemarygrumbled that she could smell liquor on the breath of the ruffians . Nellp326and Jinna were frightened by the crowding , and Cato wanted to be lifted up to see Lincoln first . Finally , Narcissa said , " Can you see if they extend around to the right rear ? " Oliphant said he thought so . She said , " Good ! We 've rocks to jump over , but good . Come on , they 've opened the Blue Room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command and confident . She found an alcove and then a door ; she smiled to Oliphant , " Coate quecoate ! " ( " Come what will ! " ) , and opened the door . They tumbled inside to find , when she closed the door again , that they were alone like a family of refugees inside what Narcissa said was the president 's favorite parlor , the Crimson Room . Oliphant wondered which president she meant . He also felt giddy with the anxiety of an intruder . The parlor room was sumptuous , with crimson satin and gold damask furniture , a grand piano , and walls covered with gilded and colored hangings . The bank of southern windows was trimmed with gilded cornices ; and there were ormolu and porcelain vases holding cut flowers on the windowsills . It was both grand and homey , and the view of the Potomac and Virginia hillsides was spectacular , if one excepted the tent encampment of the president 's Pennsylvania cavalry bodyguard in the foreground , and if one overlooked the appalling heap of the contraband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand at the view , and then pointed to the partition to the left . " The parlors connect , you see ? The Blue Room , the Green Room , and then this one . When there is too large a crowd , they open them one at a time . " To demonstrate , she reached over and popped a small door in the partition . She commanded . They poured into the breach . " Here there ! " called a military man , jumping at them . " Hello ! " Oliphant startled at the man 's suddenness and red uniform . He was also surprised by the size of the crowd pressing at them , for the White House staff had opened both the Blue and Green rooms by now . Oliphant looked again at the officer and relaxed . It was Blondel , in his brilliant red dress tunic and striped pants , a chest of medals , a blue sash , and a heavy sword , with his ornate hat in hand . He was acting the happiest of men , spinning to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you for the confusion ! So glad ! " The crowd roared again , and edged still more into the Green Room . Blondel began to explain the fuss , but Oliphant could see for himself . Here , with their backs to him , were handsome celebrities facing eager admirers . Lincoln was not among them . Instead , Mary Todd Lincoln stood midpoint in a group of five ; she was tiny and fussily dressed , with a heavy black-cordedJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 32 7p327silk , a black velvet and lace headdress , and a white point lace shawl that could have been the fraternal twin of Narcissa 's . To Mrs. Lincoln 's right side was a blocky , silver-haired potentate leaning hard on a gold-headed cane , whom Oliphant presumed was Senator Sumner , because the comtesse , Franny Wooster , stood to his side holding his arm . And on Mrs. Lincoln 's left side was the solution to the success of this levee : a stiff-backed and diminutive couple dressed in satin and sable with small jeweled crowns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four giant Cossacks in animal skins like a wall of flesh and beards . Blondel laughed . " Russians , would n't you know ? A prince of the blood and his bride , come to call on the czar 's favorite ally . Lincoln ran when he saw them , I wager . " Oliphant started , " This is impossible , Sir Henry . " " No , no , quite a chance , actually , " said Blondel . " Isaac says it should make them game for anything . " Narcissa leaned against Oliphant and whispered , nodding toward Mrs. Lincoln , " What a silly thing she is . What happens when you marry North and leave the South , I suppose , but really ! " Keats joined them from the side and gave a summary of what had happened so far . Mrs. Lincoln had indeed welcomed their approach and their gift , and was eager to meet Narcissa . Senator Sumner had been intrigued by Franny Wooster 's story , and said he would be pleased to sit in on the parley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should all go smoothly , Narcissa could expect to speak with the president before supper  --  perhaps at supper . Also , Senator Sumner , Keats had explained the night before , was a slave to Franny Wooster 's wants , and Mrs. Lincoln was girlishly dependent upon Sumner 's counsel . The key to the plan was Sumner then , until Lincoln arrived , and , as Keats had said , luck-was-the-weather . Keats now added , " Mrs. Winwood , it is time to meet your potential benefactress . Let us try our luck . " Oliphant wanted Narcissa to turn away from the others for a moment to confer with him in private . He assumed she would , in fact , and was left leaning awkwardly away when Narcissa turned toward Blondel and giggled . Blondel crooked out his arm . Narcissa reached out , and had ahold of Blondel when she stopped herself and turned back to Oliphant . " You 're coming too , are n't you ? What do you think ? " Oliphant said , " Someone should stay with Maumer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're for it , and the best . " He did not mean what he said , and he hoped that she would protest and insist that he stay by her side.  |p328She  returned to Blondel , however , and Oliphant stood with his hands on Jimmie 's shoulders watching Narcissa parade off with Blondel and Keats . Oliphant recovered quickly , and led Maum Rosemary and the adolescents to the Green Room 's windows . They wedged down the hem of the velvet carpet , to the accordion-like outcropping of the opened partition to the Blue Room . Oliphant was off to the side of the celebrities now , with a good view of Narcissa , and also with a vantage on the front of the crowd as the press of people banged against the Oriental objets d'art and the huge gilded mirrors . " Where 's de president ? " asked Cato . " I wan na see too . " Jimmie answered , " He 's a comin ' . Dat 's his Missus . " Mrs. Lincoln looked to be enjoying herself as the reception line passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bride , a dainty blonde woman who did not seem to move . Senator Sumner was also attentive to Mrs. Lincoln , leaning over to her to pat her arm like a husband giving encouragement . Sumner concerned himself with his goddaughter , too . Franny Wooster , without any real claim to special blood or office , appeared the ruling hostess here . Oliphant had thought her sheepish at dinner , and vaguely libertine at the embassy reception . Today , she shone with a cheerful beauty . And when Keats gave her a prearranged signal , she dismissed the functionary who was bringing forth the next admirer . The path was open for Narcissa and Blondel . Oliphant could not hear their conversations because of the hum of the assembly . He could presume from what he saw and anticipated . Franny Wooster sang to Senator Sumner . Blondel carried Narcissa forward . Keats stepped in behind Franny Wooster . Sumner acknowledged Keats with a glance and smile . Narcissa gave her hand to Sumner and curtsied playfully . Sumner kissed her knuckles and spoke . Keats , Franny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blondel to Mrs. Lincoln . Blondel bowed and stepped back . Narcissa curtsied again , and Mrs. Lincoln returned the gesture . Narcissa spoke and held up a flap of her white point lace shawl . Mrs. Lincoln blinked , then smiled and held up her shawl as well . Oliphant had puzzled as to who had provided a modest Illinois lawyer 's wife with what he knew to be two thousand dollars ' worth of dry goods . These two belles seemed to think , or were willing to pretend , that their mutual taste in shawls was good reason to regard each other warmly . Mrs. Lincoln introduced Narcissa to the Russians . The exchange that followed was not short , and required many of NarJohnOliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 2 9p329cissa 's butterfly hand gestures that she used for her overrich French . Mrs. Lincoln turned away momentarily to take up a jewel box from a lady behind her , and then she held the jewel box between Narcissa and the Prince and opened it . The Prince 's delighted reaction made Mrs. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narcissa took another bow . Oliphant knew the cause of all this orchestration was the gift that Keats and Blondel had given Mrs. Lincoln , saying it was from Narcissa . It was more candidly a bribe . It was one of a set of three diamond and pearl bracelets ; the other two were with Camellia and Laura in Savannah . Narcissa had entrusted hers to Keats the night before . Keats had ordered the inscription altered that morning , having " JCR LOVES NR Christmas 1840 " changed to " PEACE November 1864 . " Narcissa was now beckoning her family to come forward . Maum Rosemaryshyly pushed Nell , Jinna , and Cato before her . Oliphant urged Jimmie along , but he resisted . " I 'm stayin ' with you , Mars Jan . " The levee was thinning , as 3 P.M. and the ringing-out neared . Even the most prominent persons  --  congressmen , socialites , merchants  --  were drawingback from the Green Room , presuming that Mrs. Lincoln would not overstay her reception . Also , it was finally clear that the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero was not going to appear to shake his hand . He studied the room ; he wandered a few steps toward a burly and authoritative looking Union officer to ask after Mr. Lincoln . When Jimmie returned to Oliphant he was very unhappy . He pressed himself against the window glass to survey the White House grounds ; he moaned something about his luck . And then , to Oliphant 's consternation , and by what Oliphant believed was a secret magic that children possess so completely that when it is gone and they are adults the world becomes either insipid or tragic , Jimmie was able to broadcast a gleeful , " Golly ! " He pulled Oliphant to the sill . " Ai n't he ? Ai n't he ? " Out on the grounds , there was a tall , bony , bearded man , hatless with a black frock coat flapping behind him as he made his way heavily to the west . A small young clerk followed him , carrying a large portfolio , an umbrella , and a voluminous overcoat . It was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that Lincoln was anti-social , and that fleeing Russian royalty was understandable even in a raconteur . Nevertheless , it was too far . The pair proceeded against the wind toward the treeline that screened off the Navy and old War Department buildings . Lincoln was said to spend more time in the War Department 's telegraph room than in his bed . Still , Oliphantp330could not be sure it was Lincoln . And he wanted to interpret the world correctly for Jimmie . Jimmie was as close to a son as Oliphant might ever have , and he deserved the bottom truth . Oliphant said , " We shall see him later , Jim , we shall . " Jimmie was not appeased . He redoubled his claims as the figures receded and were lost . " I know 'd it was , sir , I know 'd I seen him ! These possumhuntin ' eyes did it , yes sir ! " " Excuse me , I hope I 'm not interfering , but I overheard and  --  " It was a young woman , standing suddenly beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended , and then she continued to Jimmie , " That was the president . You 're right . I would know those elbows from any distance . That was President Abraham Lincoln . " Jimmie grinned . " Thank you , ma'am , I knew it was him ! " Oliphant also thanked her  --  a pretty , dark-haired , understated young lady , wearing very neat clothes  --  and he apologized for the fuss . She laughed , and explained that her young cousin had been as insistent when he had visited once . Oliphant was charmed ; he introduced Jimmie and himself , adding that this was their first call at the White House . She said , " Oh , if you could only see it in the spring ! " Then she curtsied , and said her name was Bridey Lamont . Something seemed to frighten her then , because she pulled back abruptly , curtsied again , and walked away . She returned to the side of the burly Union officer , whom Oliphant noticed was standing with the help of two walking canes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room via the same door that Narcissa had found to bring them all in here . The Russian prince and princess and Cossacks followed . Then all Narcissa 's party , Sumner in the lead , started in that direction . Narcissa beckoned Oliphant . Oliphant hesitated . " Jimmie , " Oliphant said , " they 're going to meet Mr. Lincoln now . " Jimmie , his loyalty divided , said , " Are n't you comin ' ? " Oliphant looked up to see Narcissa stepping toward him . He shook her off and grimaced . He felt it best if he remained a supernumerary . At least , this idea suited his present sense of discomfort . Narcissa kept coming , and Oliphant said no , but quietly , so that she was able to see his lips move but perhaps not to hear him . It did stop her , and she twisted her face in disbelief . Oliphant smiled to calm her . He spoke to Jimmie . " You tell Miss Narcissa that I have gone outside for a smoke , and shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room without looking back . HeJohn Oliphant at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 3 1p331did need a smoke . He also needed to collect himself . He wanted to rid himself of his oppressive doubt that Narcissa 's peace commission was just more futility and vanity and  --  No , let that go , John . Yes , it 's true that Mary Lincoln is gem-hungry , and would agree to almost anything for such a bracelet . And yes , I wo n't ever have a hope as innocent as Jimmie 's again . But still , I could try ! But then , what could I say to Lincoln ? What was the use of any talk ? Oliphant knew he needed so much , then , and so urgently , that he bypassed the confusion in the vestibule and went outside without his hat , coat , or walking cane . It was more bother to avoid the rush of the carriages , for the crowd was as turbulent in retreat as it had been in attack . Oliphant got onto the White House lawn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oval park . The sky was quilted purple and gray now , and the light was indirect . A gust of wind came up , and Oliphant went over to find shelter behind the statue of Thomas Jefferson . Oliphant glanced at the Constitution in Jefferson 's hand , and thought , It was not ever meant to be cast in bronze . The South had regarded it a tissue like a marriage contract , to be dissolved when either party offended the other . Now , the North regarded it as a document like a death warrant , to be shown at the gates of Richmond , Atlanta , and soon enough Savannah . Should Narcissa petition Lincoln for peace ? Better she pay the executioner to strike the blow cleanly . Oliphant patted his morning coat for his pipe and tobacco and lighter . It was difficult in the wind , but once he got the pipe lit , his nerves did seem to improve . As he returned the Spectre Buck lighter to his coat , his hand struck the telegram from Baltimore . He could no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and opened it with the stem of his pipe , pushing again and again along the envelope 's seam . It was orders from Richmond , via the relay operator in Baltimore . It was signed by a code word that represented the collective authority of the Confederate Cabinet . It was in cipher , of course , so he could not read its particulars without his cipher book to translate . But Oliphant saw in the text the nom de guerre used by W. A. Longuemare , and he certainly recognized the configuration for New-York . His intuition told him more of what it said . He heard a noise behind him , but ignored it . lie was staring at the telegram the way a man might consider the prophecy of his future laid out in entrails.  |p332He  thought , I have n't quit . I can not resist my duty . This is the way of the world . It will be an eye for an eye , a wrong for a wrong , a city for a city . It will be New-York for Atlanta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I have nowhere else to go . Because Narcissa is lost to me , and I am lost to myself . Because I want to . And what does that make me ? A fool . Someone was talking behind Oliphant . He thought he heard his name , but no . He was numb . He was barely able to talk to himself . He whispered , " A damned fool . "  |p333WEDNESDAY  , NOVEMBER 9 , TO WEDNESDAY , NOVEMBER 16Upon Captain Butter 's return from New-York on Wednesday , November9 , he anticipated either a cool reception or a high-handed maneuver by Colonel Baker . Accordingly , Butter rehearsed a story to himself that would not be a lie  --  Baker could smell falsehood  --  and yet would omit any hint that he had followed Oliphant from the New-York ferry to Georgetownbefore he reported to Secret Service Headquarters . The major problem was that he could not explain an eighteen-hour delay between the reception of Baker 's telegram in New-York and the presentation of himself in Washington  --  notunless he made up a story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps of 217 , and pushed through to the duty desk . It was past 9 P.M. , and the sergeant at the desk directed Butter to the lone clerk in the back of the room . The clerk handed Butter an order signed for Baker by Usher Skelton . Butter was to report immediately to the detective Edgar Quillermouth in Alexandria , Virginia . Butter read the order again and barked in protest . The clerkp334shrugged and went into the telegraph room . Butter was so aggravated , however , that he then barked at the duty sergeant . The sergeant nodded sympathetically and pointed upstairs . This was all so frustrating to Butter that he forgot his position . He would make a fuss before they sent him off on more of their dirty business ! He charged up to the second floor intending to confront Lafayette Baker with the whole story about John Oliphant . Instead , he found a darkened hall and only a light from the clerk-copyists ' office across from Baker 's suite . And when Butter ducked in , planning to bark some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . She sat at a desk covered with reports arranged into four stacks ; she had obviously been at work through her dinner , with plates stacked neatly on a tray behind her . She rose and asked Butter how she could help him . " I 'm looking for Colonel Baker , ma'am . " " He 's off at the War Department with Mr. Skelton , Captain , " she said . " Wo n't you sit ? You look very tired . " " I ca n't , " said Butter , who then did sit . " I 've been ordered to get across to Alexandria . To Edgar Quillermouth . Do you know what this is ? " " I copied the order , Captain  --  that is my handwriting , but I ca n't tell you more than what I overheard . They are short-handed just now , and Mr. Quillermouth asked for you . He left this afternoon  --  to arrest a Confederate courier , I think . " " What did he say about me ? Did he mention a John Oliphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeved ? " " The Colonel has n't mentioned you at all . I said it was Mr. Quillermouth who asked Mr. Skelton for you . " She put down her pen , and tapped a particular stack of reports . " We were under the impression that your work in New-York  --  I mean , I had heard you were a complete success . Were n't you ? Is something wrong ? Can I help ? " Butter looked overlong at her . She was like a friend , even if she was mostly a stranger . She did not seem as suspicious now as she had at the War Department . He started , " A success ? " but then stood and excused himself , for his innards churned like a mad machine . He fled to the outhouse . When Butter thought over his folly later  --  and he had much time to self-criticize while convalescing the following week in Bridey Lamont 's bed  --  he realized that his first bad mistake was at the very beginning . He should have stayed with her and talked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice ! Here , he had volunteered out of invalidhood in orderAmaziah Butter at Washington City , District of Columbia 3 3 5p335to track the Rebs from Nova Scotia to Georgetown , and because he had met the challenge , and had gone beyond to inspired detective work , he was to be rewarded by being posted to Virginia as a thug . And they would not even confront him ! There was to be no opportunity to scream , or to demand he be returned to Maine , or even to confess his zeal , if that was his crime . The only consolation was that it could have been worse  --  that they could have ordered him back to the First Maine at the Jerusalem Turnpike . And so Butter , emerging from the outhouse , and ignoring his hunger and sleeplessness , flung himself into the first available quartermaster wagon in a fit of self-punishment . At the Long Bridge  --  the mile-long pontoon-bridge river crossing at Maryland Avenue  --  he had a long wait for a ride across . Finally , he climbed onto an ambulance carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huge depot of the hardest and most shirking cases in the Army . The boys should have been going to hospital , but then , Butter thought , leave it to the Army to send invalids into disgrace . He could not find a ride downriver until midnight , and then it was with a foul-mouthed teamster who made the six muddy miles to Alexandria a torment by singing of California whores with very large pudenda , " Big as a bear 's paw , red and grizzly ! " Butter lay awake , and suffered through the man 's crudity by thinking of Maine at the first snowfall and of his family ; again , he experienced the odd phenomenon that his wife 's face could blend wholly into the softer features of Mrs. Lamont  --  or was it that he was forgetting Desire ? The streets of Alexandria were as gloomy as a battlefield . Butter stumbled about in the dark . He got useless directions at the riverbank from ferrymen complaining about having to transport quarantined soldiers . He lost his way in the oldest section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ditches filled with horse skeletons . He had been this tired only a few times  --  the long ride across Maryland to Gettysburg , and that night before Fredericksburg  --  and he knew there was jeopardy in such wooziness . He was hallucinating by the time he found the hotel , and was too reduced to protest when Quillermouth would not open the door of his hotel room . He slept half sitting up in the hall . Quillermouth did get him up for breakfast , undercooked pork and stenchful eggs , and did show him considerationwhen he let Butter sleep in the room at midday . Still , Butter 's mind was slipping , and he could not understand the details of the operation . He depended upon Quillermouth and the two assistants , Dupont and Colquitt ( lanky , childish Virginians whom Butter suspected of being Rebel deserters ) ,  |p336to  tell him where to sit and what to watch for . Mostly , he was left to stare at the mist . Quillermouth did provide the general information that the suspect , George Patterson , residing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a Rebel courier en route from Toronto to Richmond , and that his whereabouts had been sold to the Secret Service by his family for greenbacks . Yet Butter lost focus when he tried to speculate how Patterson might pertain to Jake Thompson , or to the Rebel conspiracy in New-York , or even to Oliphant . Butter might have recovered with more sleep . However , a pouch arrived by rider Thursday evening with an order that they were to break off the watch and arrest Patterson for transport to Old Capitol , where he would be interrogated scrupulously . There was another order in the pouch , for Butter . It was again in Mrs. Lamont 's handwriting and again signed by Usher Skelton . It dispatched Butter into Virginia upon completion of the Patterson affair , this time to fetch a captured Mosby guerrilla from Front Royal in the Shenandoah Valley and to transport him back to Old Capitol . Butter became so angry at this new assignment that he fell over the line between depression and stupidity and made his second bad mistake . Patterson'sarrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatch " they called it . At midnight , they broke down the man 's hotel room door , whipped him with a blackjack when he awoke screaming , gagged him and tied a sack over his head , chained his hands to his ankles , and dragged him by his feet down the back steps to a waiting buckboard , where they heaved him into a trunk . Butter 's disgust was such that he tried to provide Patterson some uncalled-for care . He reached into the trunk to straighten Patterson 's bare legs before they sealed him up . Patterson was ignorant of Butter 's mercy and kicked out when touched , striking Butter very hard in the forehead , pushing Butter 's spectacles hard against his eye sockets . Later , at the Orange &; Alexandria railroad depot , Butter 's eyes throbbed , and there was blood on the bridge of his nose . He whimpered for the pain while he waited for the first train to the Shenandoah Valley , which was about ninety miles east on the Manassas Gap line . To keep going like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . Yet Butter 's whole body was betraying his judgment now . The last week in New-York had shifted him to the nighttime , so that while in daylight he felt slow-footed , at night he felt aggressive . Now , at night , he aggressively persuaded himself that if he brought in this Mosby guerrilla in good form , he might be permitted to remain in Washington . Baker did not know Johnp337Oliphant 's whereabouts . Butter hoped this might be the advantage he needed to catch Oliphant in some sort of treacherous intrigue and to prove to Baker that he was right about Oliphant . Failing that , he could throw a tantrum , presuming he could find Lafayette Baker to throw it in front of . Butter boarded a troop train before dawn Friday morning , and found a spot on the floor in a car of officers of the Fifth New York Cavalry and several Michigan regiments who were all laid out like logs . Underneath the screeching , rhythmic clatter of the train as it rolled slowly into Virginia was the ceaseless gossip of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh troops . Their talk was entirely of the Shenandoah Valley and the spectres of Jubal Early and John Mosby . A single mention of Sherman was hooted . Virginia 's sublime Shenandoah River gave the name to what had come to be called the Valley of Death . The Valley 's geography was like a sack open at both ends that was rolled out between the Blue Ridge and AppalachianMountain chains from Winchester northeast to Staunton southwest . Once , Lee had poured Stonewall Jackson and himself into the sack for its grain and foodstuffs to feed their army as they struck north in 1862 to Antietam , and Lee had returned again along the same route in 1863 to Gettysburg . Then , Lincoln had called upon Grant in 1864 to hammer Lee with a meat axe from the Wilderness to the siege of Richmond and Petersburg , and the Shenandoah Valley had become a sack for corpses . For after Jubal Early 's raid against Washington in July , Grant had ordered MajorGeneralPhilip H. Sheridan into the Valley to exterminate Rebel resistance , no matter the cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty thousand battle casualties on both sides had made the Valley a desecration  --  the burning out and murdering of civilians a blot on the Union command . Yet there was no neat military way to subdue an enemy in so open a field . So Sheridan had chased Early , slaughtered thousands while losing the same number , and then chased him again , up and down along a ninety-mile track of graves and cinders . Early was whipped in mid-September . Then Early had rallied his starving , barefooted troops for a superhuman blow at Sheridan 's army at Cedar Creek , and Sheridan was whipped in mid-October . Then Sheridan had rallied his troops with a mythologized ride called " Whirling " by the newspapers ( " I here took the affair in hand . . . . " Sheridan had telegraphed ) for a counterattack against Early that carried supremely . Early 's army died with its belly empty . In the Valley , however , the Confederacy could fight past death . It wasp338three weeks now since Sheridan 's ride , and the Valley was haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creeks could kill . Again and again , the Confederate ghosts stabbed at Federal concentrations and blocked Sheridan 's ambition to lay a railroad through the Blue Ridge in order to close on Lee at Richmond from the west . The grandest of these Confederate ghosts was Lieutenant-Colonel John Singleton Mosby and his notorious 43rd Battalion . Mosby 's Raiders had long been a Union nemesis that had now been transformed by the Confederatecollapse into an infamous scourge  --  six hundred irregular horse soldiers who , it was said , rode moonbeams and ate fearlessness as they paralyzed fifty times their number with the threat of night raids . It appeared that Mosby could operate at will from Cedar Creek to Winchester , and it was certain that he was a holy hero to Valley residents , who would hide his men in their children 's beds if asked . In desperation , Sheridan approved outrages , arguing , " Since I came into this Valley from Harper 's Ferry , every train , every small party , every straggler , has been bushwhacked . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torturing for information , and executing Confederate prisoners , especially Mosby 's men , as outlaws . The worst incident had been at Front Royal , when Brigadier-General George A. Custer , a 25-year-old daredevil , had hanged six of Mosby 's men . They had cursed him at the end of the rope , " Mosby 'll kill ten for every one of us ! " Mosby had retaliated in late October by executing four Union troopers . But there was nothing Mosby could do about the concomitant Federal extremes , such as the routine firing of flour mills , hay barns , silos , and stockyards , or such as the Union policy of herding chained civilians onto troop trains , so that when Mosby attacked , Virginians died first . In his sleep , Butter thought he overheard that his train carried hostages . There was a voice above him explaining , " At Winchester , they say , when they hit ' em , this of cousin stands up to the window of the car , and he yells out , Shoot trew me , Johnny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke , he wondered if it had been a nightmare . Friday afternoon was grim enough . It had taken ten hours to travel roughly a hundred miles of on-loadings , delays on sidings , and off-loadings . The last sixty miles had been on the difficult Manassas Gap line through the Bull Run mountains and twisting across the plain and foothills into the Manassas Gapp339itself , the gateway to the Valley . And here at the foot of the Blue Ridge range , just inside the Valley , was what remained of the farming and railroad village of Front Royal . Where there once must have been a depot , there were now decaying layers of captured stores piled like cords of wood ; where there once must have been a main street , there were now herds of cavalry remounts and bony pack mules ; and where there should have been a town center , there was the trembling bivouac of a badly beaten up infantry brigade  --  two Pennsylvania regiments and a New York one splayed in mud and a drenching dampness . Butter had a difficult hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's **33;13409;TOOLONG ; and when he did find him he was presented with a porky , innocuous farmer 's attorney named Kaiser , from Altoona , he said . Kaiser explained that his senior officers were either on leave or in the hospital with dysentery , pneumonia , or weak hearts . The brigade 's general was dead from infection , and there were also sixty men quarantined with what might be measles . Butter stopped the man 's complaining and asked for the prisoner . Kaiser heaved phlegm and led the way to the sod-built cabin that served as the brigade 's stockade . Most of it was given to captured deserters from both armies , who were either penned up out back like hogs or chained together out front . Kaiser boasted to Butter that this prisoner was the second Mosby guerrilla they had captured in a week . He added that the first one , Edmunston , had tried to bribe the guard , had then tried to escape off the train , and had also tried to bribe the guards in Alexandria . Kaiser opened the crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy with hate , and just crazy . " Kaiser 's prologue was obviously meant to prepare Butter for discovering that this new Mosby guerrilla , Dingledine , had been bound hand and foot with rawhide and then had been sewn inside a stinking horseblanket . Butter cut the boy out , freed his hands and feet , and did not comment . But when Butter carried Dingledine outside , and Kaiser protested about security , Butterlet go a shout at the man 's birthright that sent Kaiser away huffily . Dingledine was too weak at first to walk , and he had soiled himself . Butter ordered a guard to fetch clothes and shoes from the dead man 's pile nearby . Butter could not get boots on Dingledine because of the swelling of his feet . He carried him again to a cooking fire at the brigade 's tent-made chapel . Dingledine ate and vomitted , and it was a few hours before Butter had a fully alive prisoner . Butter got him back to the depot 's crushed platform , and fixed them both a place out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his Army Colt in his lap , less because of Dingledine than because of the grumbling from passing troopers , " Save a long trip , soldier , with a long rope ! " Butter 's fourth and final bad mistake was partially forced upon him  --  but then it was also a culmination of two days of his soreheadedness  --  when word got around about his prisoner . The railroad men thought Dingledine a mark of Cain . The first two troop trains to stop at Front Royal refused Butter permission to board . And the engineer of the next train ( two baggage cars and three horsepen cars ) shook off Butter 's request belligerently . However , it was now past 10 P.M. , and Butter was not going to be denied . The staff officers in the baggage cars barred Butter 's entry too . Butter crossed to the opposite side of the horsepen cars , and pushed Dingledine up . He pitched dirty straw and manure out the open doors to make a roost for them with blankets and oats bags . It looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they started to roll , Butter decided it was sufferable . True , his eyes still hurt him , and the cut on his nose kept filling with puss , and he had not slept lying down flat in three days , and whatever he ate passed through him like poison , and there was that lingering weakness in his knees from Petersburg . Yet he could push these ailments aside now as minor , because he was on his way out of the Valley . Instead , he could more completely burden himself with brooding about Washington City ahead  --  about Oliphant , and Baker , and Wetherbee and Rufus at the War Wagon , and even about Mrs. Lamont . Butter paced and slumped and paced some more . He was willing to upset himself with his worst expectations . He was even willing to confess that his temper , pride , and stubbornness were life-threatening weaknesses . Butter welcomed any fantasy , then , in order to pretend that he was not in a reeking stockcar lurching through the Blue Ridge Mountains , the only light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only company a dozen officers ' mounts and a sleeping farmboy who by some twist had become a devil of the state . In sum , Butter mesmerized himself . Yet no matter how he excused himself afterward to Mrs. Lamont and Wetherbee , none of these distractions , fears , or tricks of the imagination could adequately explain how a man could be so foolish as to fall backward off of a moving train . Butter 's panic overcame the pain in his lower back as he rolled over and arose to see the train vanishing into the black night . He looked hard and saw three choices : He could quit ; he could push into these woods and hope top341find a farmhouse where they would not kill him outright as a Yankee ; or he could catch that train . Butter ran for his life . He cried out every few steps , " Stop ! Stop ! " But it was a futile plea , as wasted on the train as on the wicked pain in his hip . He ran on and on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after his hope . At some point , the train rounded a bend and Butter was left alone , a heaving , sweating , wild , wild man , his greatcoat soaring behind him , his arms swinging like chicken wings , his thoughts reduced to a single , succinct scream for God Almighty 's attention , " Shit ! " Nevertheless , he did continue to run under those thick clouds racing across a crescent moon ; he did continue to run with so much pain that he knew if he stopped he would not be able to start again ; he did continue to run because there was nothing else to do , and he did not want to die . The miracle that stopped the train on a grade appeared at first to Butter as a way for fate to torture him further . At any moment , he knew , that train could rumble off . He closed on the last car , one hundred yards , fifty yards , twenty yards , and then he fell into the gravel . He had misjudged the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak . He rolled himself over , and might have lain there indefinitely , with the security of having the prize so near , if the train had not then vibrated with the engagement of gears . Butter was up and inside the car like a hound . Dingledine remained tucked up and asleep . No one on earth had known that Butter had gone missing , and now no one knew that he had returned from the doomed . Butter chanted , " Shit ! Shit ! Shit ! " and fell forward into the straw . Butter did not know where he was when daylight woke him . Then he felt the pain and was fully informed . They were stopped on a siding outside of Fairfax Station , about ten miles from Alexandria , while a supply train groaned past moving south . Butter had a momentary hope that they might be headed on the spur into the Long Bridge and Washington itself , but , for whatever reason , they were diverted northeast . By the time they slowed outside of the Alexandria yards , Butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dingledine , and waved the Army Colt at him for emphasis . He ordered Dingledine to cut out and saddle two Army horses . And when the train stopped again on a bend , so that the men in the engine could not see the opposite rear side of the stockcar , Butter had Dingledine get the mounts down . The hard part was to get Butter mounted , because he could no longer sit up . Dinglcdinc cased the second mount up to the door and pulled when hep342was told . Butter screamed and screamed . Then they were off on stolen horses . Butter lay on his belly , dangling his pistol and repeatedly warning Dingledinethat if he tried to run , Butter would not only shoot at him , he would also tell the eventual pursuers that worse than being a Mosby , Dingledine was a horse thief : He would be hanged without ever seeing a jail . They achieved the ferry at Alexandria before noon . It was just a barge pulled by a steam tug from Alexandria to the Navy Yard , but Butter thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not dismount , however , because the horse 's warmth seemed to soothe the pain . They regained Pennsylvania Avenue at Fifth Street within the hour . Butter knew he should keep on to Old Capitol Prison . The temptation of Secret Service Headquarters won out . Now it was Private Dingledine , C.S.A. , who carried Butter to aid . They did not stop at the challenge of the duty sergeant . Butter cocked his pistol and told Dingledine to keep on to the second floor . At Lafayette Baker 's door , Butter slipped to the floor , and called , " God damn , I 've come back ! " Butter pounded on the wall . " I 'm back , I 'm back ! " Butter was gasping against Dingledine 's knees when the door opened and Usher Skelton emerged waving a pistol . Then there were legs all around Butter , and he saw Mrs. Lamont 's face above him . He realized slowly that the horror in her look must be because of what he looked like , unless it was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Thanks , Reb . " Or at least he remembered saying that . Butter also thought he heard Dingledinesay , " Damn Yankee ! " before he heard nothing at all . How Butter got into Mrs. Lamont 's bed was that she put him there , with the assistance of Major Torrance Wetherbee , Job " White-Pine " Mills , and Mrs. Lamont 's young sister-in-law Miss Vera Lamont . Why he got there was more revealing , and , once he had learned the particulars , profoundly persuadedButter to Mrs. Lamont 's part in all things . It had been instantly fixed by Usher Skelton that Butter was unfit for service and was again invalided . It was also assumed that Butter had no room of his own in Washington , and that he would need medical attention regardless . An ambulance wagon was sent for . By this time , Mrs. Lamont had intervened authoritatively . She learned from White-Pine that Butter had a bosom friend nearby , and she asked White-Pine to fetch Major Wetherbee . Wetherbee arrived like a boulder off a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virile Marylander who had become as militant in hisp343drunkenness as he had once been in his nature . Wetherbee took up Butter 's body like a child 's and announced that he would shoot the first **27;13444;TOOLONG tried to stop him . Mrs. Lamont caught up with Wetherbee at the front door , and learned for her trouble that Wetherbee would sooner let Butter float down the Potomac than be thrown into one of the pits called hospitals . Once Wetherbee , growling and spitting , had communicated that he aimed to transport Butter to the notorious saloon the War Wagon , since what he thought Butter needed was bourbon whiskey and rest , Mrs. Lamont not only forced a compromise but also took the solution upon herself . And so the ambulance wagon made a detour from its usual rounds and descended down Pennsylvania Avenue to the corner of West Eleventh Street . Here on the ground floor was the popular bookshop of Blanchard and Mohun ; above was the drygoods emporium of W. D. Lamont &; Brother . Importantly , these two shops represented only the front half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double house , opening onto the wooded interior of the block , contained the meticulously neat , cozy , and well-furnished rooms of the two Lamont women , war widow and war orphan , respectively . Butter awoke Sunday afternoon to feel a long red tail flapping on his pillow and against his whiskers . He was not entirely ignorant . He knew he had been evacuated here and knew something of where he was , for he had discerned through his pain the voices of Wetherbee , White-Pine , and two angels . He also recalled conversing with his rescuers about Dingledine , and about how he had outrun a locomotive as only Natty Bumppo could have done . This latter reminiscence had been encouraged by Wetherbee the night before as he had doctored Butter with bourbon whiskey . And so , as soon as Butter touched the tail , he knew that it was attached to the ancient and massive Rufus , Wetherbee 's red hunting dog . Butter remained flat on his back and experimented with the trouble in his hips . The pain froze him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the room by just moving his head . There were two dressers , a vanity , lounge chairs , two wardrobes , dark green and blue wallpaper in floral patterns , partially shuttered windows , and then a body in the bed on the other side of Rufus . It was Wetherbee , asleep so silently and deeply in his usual stupor that he looked cheerful and peaceful . Butter wanted his spectacles to study details , but did not know where they could be . Ile sighed . " Hello , Rufus , remember me ? " Rufus wagged harderp344and raised his head at the foot of the bed . Butter added , " Are we in heaven , old fellow ? " Rufus 's yawn made Butter yawn , and that put him back to sleep until the Lamonts , with two young children , arrived back from church , and there was a maternal gathering at Butter 's bedside to exchange identities and motives . The Pennsylvania Avenue shop of W. D. Lamont &; Brother had once been the southernmost of a chain of similar shops established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because of , the advance of the railroad companies from New Jersey to the capital . All the shops had been based upon the original family store in Trenton , New Jersey , which had been operated successfully for forty years by the Drakes of Trenton : a father who had served in the Continental Army during the retreat from Philadelphia to the winter despair of Valley Forge , 1777  --  78 ; and a son who had served but had not fired a shot in battle during the War of 1812 . The precocious grandson , W. D. Lamont , had been prevented from enlisting in the Army for the Mexican War , 1846  --  48 , by the stubborn determination of his mother and his wife , both of whom had insisted that his sentimental patriotism did not exceed his familial responsibilities . Later , W. D. Lamont had altered the name of the family shop , and subsequent chain , to memorializehis brother , David , who had fought at Mexico City and died of dysentery in New Orleans on his way home . In 1861 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life 's dream to honor the war-like tradition of his mother 's family , the Drakes , and had rushed to the capital in time to join the Army of the Potomac camp in Virginia near Bull Run River . W. D. Lamont had survived the first battle of Bull Run because he had remained in camp as an acting quartermaster , but he had not survived the summer  --  possibly because of a weak heart , bad kidneys , and the panic-stricken retreat of the Federals to the capital under that merciless July sun . W. D. Lamont 's eldest son , David Drake Lamont , was then a member of the New Jersey State Legislature ; he was also a well-spoken Democrat who deeply distrusted the Abolitionists and the Republicans for having engineeredLincoln 's election despite the certainty that it would fracture the Union . Nevertheless , David Lamont saw his duty , and followed his two brothers into the Army . David Lamont 's second wife , Bridey ( David was ten years older than she ) , and infant son soon followed him to the capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he contributed his experience at the procurement and distribution of supplies to clothe and shelter the burgeoning Army of the Potomac . In late Novem/ber 1862 , David Lamont rode out with a wagon train to Major-General Ambrose E. Burnside 's huge army in order to deliver long-delayed shipments of winter coats . He stayed on with General Joseph Hooker 's staff to observe at what became the battle of Fredericksburg . Officially , David Lamont was missing in action since his failure to report for muster on the retreat across the Rappahannock River on the evening of December 15 . A reasonable assumption was that he had fallen at the base of Marye 's Heights in one of the half-dozen assaults against impregnable Confederate positions on December13 , and that he had been buried in the mass graves carved out during the truce between Lee and Burnside on the 14th . As Butter lay next to Rufus and Wetherbee listening to Bridey and Vera Lamont recite their family history , however , and overcall and contradict each other as to the final events of David Lamont 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to assume that there was anything reasonableabout the war . For two years , they had remained in Washington in order to search for David Lamont in hospitals , on lists released from the Confederate hospitals and prisoner-of-war camps , on lists of prisoner exchanges , and by interviewing those men they could find who were near or with David Lamont the night before and the day of his disappearance . Meanwhile , the W. D. Lamont &; Brother chain  --  always a pioneering effort in shopkeeping  --  had faded with their hope , so that now only this shop and the original in Trenton remained . And even these two were threatened by debts to European manufacturers that only the bluster of the patriarch himself could have solved . One remaining Lamont brother was home in New Jersey after being crippled by the kick of a horse ; the other had died the previous spring at Cold Harbor . Vera Lamont ran the shop in Washingtonwith the help of two other war widows , who lived on the third floor of the double house with their many children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kindermann who lived in the stockroom . The primary merchandise had become mourning clothes , the sales of which had boomed in 1864 to the point that , along with Bridey Lamont 's $100-amonthsalary from the War Department ( a position she had secured through her husband 's comrades ) and the money they received from the rental of David Lamont 's Trenton home , the Lamont women were able to maintain themselves and their many charges by blood , marriage , and adoption . " David was n't a soldier like you , gentlemen , " said Vera Lamont . At another point , 13ridcy Lamont said , " He did n't want this war . " " He wanted to lx governor of New Jersey , " explained Vera.  |p346Bridey  Lamont also explained , " David should have been in the Congress working for peace , and not out there . He thought the war was insane . " Still later , Vera Lamont said , " The officers we have found from the Fredericksburg battle , they say it was murder to send those men against the cannons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . " " We pray , " said Bridey Lamont . " There are many who 've come back after a year or longer . There was a boy from the Richmond prison , from Libby . He 'd been missing since April of last year . And we have had fellows who did n't know themselves for months , and some who still do n't . And they miscopy names on the prisoner lists . " " Prayer ca n't hurt , " said Vera Lamont . " Mr. Lincoln attends our church regularly , " said Bridey Lamont . " TheSecond Presbyterian . No one prays harder than the president . " " We 've done some good , " said Vera Lamont . " It has n't been a waste . " " I prayed for you last Wednesday , " said Bridey to Butter . Vera smiled . " We prayed for the three of you today at church . Billy wanted you to know that he prayed for the dog too . " These confessions were not conveyed of a piece and sedately . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Butter and Wetherbee were force-fed soup and tea , while Billy , Bridey Lamont 's 4-year-old , wandered in and out of his nap or his 2-year-old sister , Maude , appealed for attention , and while Vera tried unsuccessfully to get Wetherbee to surrender his ruined uniform for cleaning . Vera was a diminutive brunette woman , under 25 , not as pretty as Bridey , still pleasant-looking and very clean , with a fierce busyness that animated her features and made her agile and quick . She was capable of picking up a room , preparing the children 's supper , and serving medicinal foods even as she tended the fire , corralled her nephew , and maneuvered Rufus and Wetherbee . Butter thought Vera either brave or wrathful ; she threw her domestic talent at Wetherbee and was not bewildered by his misanthropy  --  it seemed to encourage her to ever more devious assaults at his self-contempt . Finally , Bridey chased everyone out . Alone with Butter , she declared herself : He was free to go when he could walk on his own , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl onto Pennsylvania Avenue like a derelict . In the meantime , he would remain in this bed because it was the only one long enough for him to lay prone . Also , he was a simpleton for his modesty . She said she had grown up with a brother and two male cousins and had seen more naked men than women in her life . She closed saying that pridep347was the devil 's germ and sleep was God 's cure . Butter awoke again in the humming darkness . He felt the helpless child to discover Bridey Lamont standing over him . She said he must eat more of the soup , and that she would feed him to spare the bedcovers . Butter conceded that he was more injured than he had wanted to admit . He apologized for his earlier , silent ingratitude . She seemed to appreciate his honesty and eased her reserve ; the result was that she was both softer and more comfortable in command of the situation . She also wanted to know more , and chatted excitedly while Butter accepted scoop after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wetherbee ? He hates this and that , hates everything ! He wo n't take more than a mouthful , and sits there with the door ajar and his hand on the bottle . We do n't try to get that from him . Vera 's father was much more difficult toward the end , and we know what to do . " Butter tried , " Do n't push at him  --  " Bridey Lamont continued , " I know , I know , he 's most skittish . He looks at home by the fire , I have to say , and he 's good with children . Billy adores the dog . And now Major Wetherbee 's told Billy stories that make him rapturous . When I put Billy to bed tonight , he wanted to know when Major Wetherbee was coming back , and if he can come talk to you about black bears . " Butter managed a joke . " Anytime , anytime , I used to wrestle ' em  --  " " That 's the sort of thing he tells Billy , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this War Wagon ? Is that so ? And your bear-riding ? The worst one was about John Brown . He said he had John Brown on the ground , and pointed a shot gun at him , and John Brown said , Shoot ! You ca n't kill me ! Shoot ! I shall live forever ! ' " Butter held her wrist to stop the spoon in order to talk . " Tory likes that story . And must like you to tell it . " Bridey Lamont nodded . Butter added , " I 've not known Tory to deceive about himself . He was with the Second Dragoons , under Colonel Robert E. Lee , before the war . He could have been at Harper 's Ferry . The marines made the final assault . But it is possible . " " And about him setting fire to his father ? " she asked . " Tory 's a Marylander . His family 's fought with Lee since the war . Do you understand ? That 's not something a man can figure . Tory 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have a division or corps of his own . He used to say that he 's sworn to defend the Constitution but he 's not sworn to take pleasure in it . About his dad , yes . Tory was with the part ofp348the Second Dragoons that was given over to Colonel Baker two years back to chase Rebs like Mosby . They called them Baker 's Rangers . That was before I came in with the First D.C. So what I know , I do n't really know . They say they were chasing stragglers after Gettysburg , up on the Monocacy River , in Frederick County , Maryland . That 's where Tory 's from . And there were wrong things done on both sides . After Gettysburg , it was like the world had gone wrong for a while . The ambulance trains never stopped . " " He did burn out his family ? " " He takes responsibility for it . Yes . The answer 's yes . " Bridey Lamont shook her head . Butter continued , " You must n't assume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any delicate men left , or women , neither . Tory was with the regiment at Sycamore Church . You know . They were obliterated . He was captured , but got out of Libby Prison somehow . " " One boy told Mr. Skelton that they shot and shot with those special rifles of theirs . And shot and shot . " " I have n't asked Tory about it yet , " said Butter . " He 'll tell me someday . He 's one of the hard cases now . He has n't reported back to duty since he got back from Libby . And they have n't sent for him , I expect . He 's let the Colonel know he aims to kill him if he 's ever given cause , like meeting him . It 's not sensible . Tory marks Colonel Baker for something . About Mosby , or chasing Mosby , or the rest . Colonel Baker 's done a share of the wrong in this war , his share . You know some of it . It was worse before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , he 's a soldier . If you asked him , he 'd say he was garrisoning the War Wagon in case the Rebs try for it . He 's a hard case . It means  --  he 's made his own kind of peace . " " And what about you , Captain Butter ? " " Oh , I expect  --  you mean about making peace ? " Bridey Lamont nodded . " I 've looked at it . While I was running after that train , I thought about this being crazed behavior for a boy from the deep woods . I 'm a curious fellow , though , and  --  stubborn . And when I get up the next time , I intend to keep myself on what I 'm curious about and let the Colonel catch his own locomotive engines . " Butter took another spoonful of soup and swallowed slowly . He added , " Something I know about hunting . The man that wanders from the track might make a dinner rather than having one . " Bridey laughed , spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that you are hunting ? Or are you being charming ? " " Maybe , " Butter began . " There 's also this Rebel gentleman named Johnp349Oliphant . The Colonel knows  --  Oliphant knows  --  I know something ! " Bridey wiped his whiskers . " A secret ? " And Butter laughed . " Glory hallelujah , maybe the secret of the war ! " The fever that overwhelmed Butter very early Monday morning pushed him deep into his fear of death . He had watched stronger men than himself survive a wound and make a brave beginning at convalescence only to collapse inexplicably and then succumb so suddenly it was like a sunset . Inside himself , he was terrified , and prayed simply and passionately whenever he could untangle his mind . Bridey and Vera Lamont understood the peril as well and fought . They forced liquids into him , cooled down his body with ice , and resisted the recommendation of the first physician to administer morphine . They were of the opinion that Butter was so weakened by his cumulative exhaustion that any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second and third physicians agreed with the Lamonts ; they provided herbs that miraculously eased Butter 's pains and lowered the fever intermittently . The crisis passed Tuesday after dawn , when Butter awoke from a nightmareabout falling into a pool of foam . He was actually floating in his own sweat . Bridey Lamont was sitting beside him , reading . He said , " Hello , I 'm back , Butter 's back . " She shushed him and wiped his face . Soon Vera came in to help her change the bedclothes . They made him eat more chicken soup and urinate in a bottle before they carefully laid him back to sleep . Butter came out of his drowsinesslater to see Wetherbee also standing over him , with a silly smile and a head shrouded in cigar fumes . Wetherbee said , " They 're good , they 're very good , those two witches . I kept tellin " em to let you go with your pants and boots on . They hid ' em from me . Hell , Zee , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you smell my cigar ? It 's all they 'll let you have for now . Let me whiff it up good for you . " By Wednesday morning , November 16 , Butter was recovered enough to be restless and fretful . He insisted he be permitted to prop himself up to watch the clock on the vanity . He calculated that it was forty-nine hours since Bridey Lamont had agreed to Butter 's hallucinatory plea that she telegraph Gouverneur Nevers in New-York for help . And he knew that it was a full week since he had followed Oliphant to Georgetown ; by now ,  |p350Oli|phant  could have escaped anywhere , including to Richmond . Butter 's failure seemed complete . What he had to show for two months of hard work was a bruise from his thigh to his shoulder that Tory Wetherbee said made Butter look as if the blue uniform were becoming his new skin . Butter also had a fair insight into the reports in the newspapers that they had brought him . Here was an item that General Benjamin F. Butler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send-off yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Hotel by the grateful citizens of New-York . The Reverend Henry Ward Beecher had stood up on a chair to make a rousing speech , thanking Ben Butler for his steadfast defense of the Union and its first city in the crisis just past , heaping all the praise for the peacefulnessof Election Day upon Butler and his staff ( Haggerty and Puffer were named ) , and finally speculating that Ben Butler 's fame would spread across the country in waves so that someday soon enough the echo would return , " Butler for President ! " Butter did not flinch at the Butler news . He was accustomed to the injustice of the so-called superior officer gathering the praise due his subordinates . And he was too taken by the other items that were like clues to a crime that had yet to be committed , or if it had , had yet to be revealed , or if it was , had yet to be understood . In Montreal , for example , the Rebel agent and provocateur George Sanders had hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custody , and he was successfully maneuvering the Canadian colonial governmentnot only to refuse extradition to Vermont , but also to delay a trial in Canada . There was even mention that George Sanders might be able to have all charges dropped because Canada had no jurisdiction in the case . NewEnglandwas said to be enraged . And the political situation between the United States and Canada would not improve with the statements coming out of Montreal ; the newspaper report read , " The leader of the raiders Lt. Bennett Young of Morgan 's Raiders said that his raid was made to retaliate for the acts committed by Grant , Sheridan , and others not in accordance with civilized warfare . The St. Albans raiders are loud in boasting of their work , and threaten all sorts of retaliation in case any punishment is inflicted . Their friends are trying to delay the proceedings until instructions can be got from Richmond . " In Chicago , Butter read , six more members of the outlawed Sons of Liberty had been arrested . All the arrested claimed innocence of the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Electionp351Day . There was no mention of the infamous Captain Tom Hines . In the Shenandoah Valley , Butter read , the speculation was that Jubal Early 's attack at Cedar Creek on October 19 , which had almost carried the day until Sheridan 's famous ride , had actually been planned as the first stage of an assault that was meant to have carried into Pennsylvania as a terror raid in order to influence the Election there . It was now speculated that Early 's attack might have been the military aspect of a coordinated effort by Richmond to throw the Union into turmoil on Election Day . Butter was not concerned with the voluminous speculations about Sherman . The scale of the failed Confederate conspiracy on Election Day was fantasy enough for him . What passionate desperation ! To throw a starving army against superior numbers in the Valley , to rob banks in Vermont like outlaws , to connive with anarchists like the Sons of Liberty in New-York , to aim to release thousands of depraved prisoners upon Chicago , and to try God knew what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Almighty was mindful of John Oliphant 's conduct in the capital , because Butter on his blue rump was not going to stop him or anyone . Butter pushed the newspapers away . He tried to calm himself by taking up a gift from Bridey Lamont , a new volume called The Maine Woods , A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers by Henry D. Thoreau . It did not work . He was envious of Sheridan . Oh , to make such a ride , and to do one 's duty , and to help save the Union ! Butter 's nap into the cool , muggy twilight of a misty day left him resigned . He was not an intellectual like Mr. Thoreau . This sickbed was the finish . He was beaten . It was time to quit . The trail was cold . The game had escaped . Another hour of such futile daydreaming and Butter abandoned even self-accusation . He cheered himself by getting out of bed to get to the w.c. by himself , with the support of two hickory canes that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at the imminent homecoming of Bridey Lamont . Unlucky in war , he was inexactly aware that he was experiencing feelings that could only be appropriate to those who are lucky in love . For the present , he was alive and safe , and his home was several hundred miles to the north , and Bridey Lamont was his personal savior . He sighed : Whenever he thought how happy Bridey made him , he thought how unhappy this would make Desire ; and whenever he thought how happy Desire would be to know that he was invalided and probably coming home again , he thought how unhappy this might make Bridey , or himself . This soul-searching was abandoned too when Butter heard footfalls fromp352the direction of the central stairs . They were adult steps . Butter arranged himself for Bridey , so that he would look the promising convalescent in pressed pants and clean flannel blouse . There was a knock on the door . Butter said , " Yes ? " " Excuse me , Captain , are you awake ? " It was Vera Lamont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up like this ? " " Fine , I 'm fine , Miss Lamont . " " There are two men here for you . " Butter sensed her uneasiness , and asked , " Who are they ? " " They would n't give me their names , " she said . " They asked for you . " Butter 's panic got his feet on the floor ; he asked , " Is one short and lean , and the other broad as a bulldog ? " Vera nodded yes and frowned . Butter reached for his boots . He imagined two faces , Edgar Quillermouth and John Odell ; he imagined Room 19 , the interrogation chamber at Old Capitol Prison ; he imagined Lafayette Baker 's angry face . Butter pulled a boot on and felt his genitals contract , and when he pulled on the other boot , his bowels rumbled . Butter said , " Vera , I 'm ready now . " She said , " I can ask them to leave . You 're most unwell . " " No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reported that there had been nothing said of him at headquarters for two days . In the Secret Service , Butter knew , extreme silence could mean extreme jeopardy . Butter said , " Show them in . Give me a moment to get ready . Do n't worry , there wo n't be trouble . Here , would you help me ? " Vera was reluctant , but she did help him pull on his uniform coat and button up . She smoothed out the bedcovers while Butter , on his hickory canes , took a turn in front of the mirror . He had never looked paler . Vera said , " I do n't want to interfere . Should I fetch Major Wetherbee ? He said to , if there was need . " " I think not , " said Butter . " Tory would n't understand . " " But I do n't understand ! " She was agitated now . " Ca n't I send them away ? Bridey will be home soon . And Major Wetherbee said they were n't to take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am doing . I have endangered you all by staying here . I know how this business works . Lordie , I have done it . Show them in . " Vera tried one more time to protest . Butter smiled at her spirit , and said , " It is n't that they really need an invitation to come for me , Miss Lamont . It is just polite . " She left the door open , saying at the last , " What kind of a war is this ? "  |p353Butter  mumbled , " A war kind of war . " He was standing on his canes like a weeping willow tree . He breathed deeply , straightened as best he could , and watched the doorjamb fill with the two most unexpected human beings . The pair of strangers  --  a dwarf and a giant , both Negroes  --  wandered in behind Vera Lamont . Butter looked blankly at Vera , and she shrugged . The dwarf roamed to the window , then back to the wardrobes , tapping the carpet with a blond wood walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dwarf turned and asked if he was Captain Amaziah Butter of the United States Volunteers . Butter coughed at the smell of the dwarf 's pipe  --  a sharp , earthy odor . The dwarf continued in a conspiratorial tone to ask if they could confer in private . Butter nodded to Vera Lamont , who shut the door behind her . The dwarf introduced himself as Virginia John Goodenough and offered his card . He also said that he was called Wild Jack . The card was a facsimile of the Jack of Spades , with a place for his name , and below that , " Free Gentleman of Color , " and below that , " Hotel Henri IV , New Orleans , " and below that , " Confidential Inquiries . " Butter sat down on the bed to study the card . Wild Jack Goodenough was small only in terms of his child 's arms and tiny legs ; his torso and head were those of a full-sized and vigorous man . He was dressed madly for a simple citizen , but elegantly for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white vertical stripes and pantaloons in dark gray , a gold and silver checkered vest , a gold tie and a dark blue cape , crowned with a light gray top hat . He also had a full black beard and moustache and steel-rimmed spectacles , which he adjusted as he closed his presentation by introducing his associate , Joshua Rue . Here was a man whom God had granted what had been left over when God made Wild Jack ; Joshua Rue was a casual giant , not tall so much as massive , with a much darker color than Wild Jack 's and with broad features that were established permanently in an exuberant smile . His long wiry hair was parted in the middle of his head and flopped over his ears like a helmet . Wild Jack commented that Joshua Rue was not the simpleton he looked . Wild Jack explained that the giant was hard of hearing . Joshua Rue also had hands so big they were like bear paws . He seemed shy about his hands , keeping them out of sight in the pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Butter believed he had their measure , and said , " I 'm correct in  --  You 're from Mr. Nevers , in New-York , is n't that true ? " Wild Jack was now opening and searching drawers , showing foundp354objects to Joshua Rue , and returning them to their place ; he smiled at Butter and spoke to Joshua Rue . " He asks if we were sent by a Mr. Nevers of New-York ! " Joshua Rue hummed . Wild Jack spoke to Butter . " Sir , please , our work requires profound confidence . " Butter tried , " I suppose I can guess . So why ask ? Perhaps it 's for me to tell you about John Oliphant , the Reb agent . Did Mr. Nevers explain ? " " He asks if he might explain about a Mr. Oliphant ! " Joshua Rue hummed . Wild Jack had half climbed into Bridey Lamont 's wardrobe ; he looked over to add , " If it pleases you . " Butter said , " He 's in Georgetown a week now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister-in-law and entourage . I shall write it down . No  --  " Butter began the story of Oliphant in New-York and after , while Wild Jack turned his attention to the blanket chest . Butter switched to his suspicion of Lafayette Baker , while Wild Jack switched to the empty wardrobe . Butter stopped talking to see if this might matter . Wild Jack continued his strange searching . Butter sighed . " Just what is it that Mr. Nevers has sent you for ? Do you understand what I am saying ? Oh , what 's the use ? " Wild Jack looked up from running his hand under the rug 's hem . " Mr. Rue , he wants to know why we are here , and what is the use ? ! " Joshua Rue hummed . Wild Jack said , " What we have been told is that we should involve you more directly in our assignment . " " How 's that ? I 'm in charge here ! Who are you ? And what are you looking for ? " Wild Jack said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge ! And he asks what we are looking for ! " Wild Jack ran his hand under the mattress on the far side of the bed . " Why do you ask ? " he said to Butter . " Are you hiding something ? " " No , of course not , " said Butter . " But why are you  --  ? " " Mr. Rue , we are telling Captain Butter he has our sympathy ! " Wild Jack stepped in front of Butter . " Captain , you have our sympathy . Your wounds have curtailed crucial aspects of our assignment . This is why we have delayed until tonight in approaching you . " Butter started softly , " You delayed ? How long have you been watching me ? How much do you know ? Do you know where Oliphant is ? " Wild Jack shut the last night-table drawer and flipped the Thoreau book open . " He wants to know , Mr. Rue , if we know everything ! " Joshua Rue hummed , nodding vigorously in affirmation . Wild Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany us , Captain Butter ? " Butter put his weight forward on his legs . " What ? " Wild Jack said , " I am telling him , Mr. Rue , we are henceforth consulting allies ! " And before Wild Jack could speak to Butter , Butter was up . " This is so like Nevers ! I 'm the fool ! If you 'd just said straight out ! Yes , yes , where to ? Where are we going ? Georgetown ? " " Mr. Rue , Captain Butter has agreed ! " Joshua Rue opened the door . Wild Jack twirled his cane . " We are n't going far , be assured , and we have a hack , " said Wild Jack . " Three blocks . Willard 's Hotel . The dining room . To observe Mr. Oliphant and an Englishman , Sir Henry Blondel . And yes , Captain , we do know everything  --  so far . " SATURDAY , NOVEMBER 19What made Bridey Lamont cry with frustration was that Butter accusedher of treating him like a prisoner of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treating him " like your sacred husband , who you tried to hide in here from the war ! " What made Butter repent was that Captain Wetherbee , dozing against Rufus on the bedroom 's divan , awakenedlong enough to inform Butter that speaking to Mrs. Lamont like that was jackassedness . What made Vera Lamont burst into the bedroom , her robe incorrectly buttoned in her upset , and lecture Butter and Wetherbee on their bad manners and cruelty to Bridey was that earlier in the evening  --  it was now well past midnight , and so very early Saturday morning  --  she , Vera , had admitted in confidence to Butter and Wetherbee how delightful it was to have menfolk strutting around the house again , even if one was a brooder and the other one was a drinker ; and Vera also declared that now , in consideration of this abuse of Bridey , she was furious and suspicious , and ready to turn Butter and Wetherbee out even if one was a cripple and the other one was a lout . And what set this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying and Vera breaking an empty whiskey bottle in the fire , was that the household had been awakened by another unannounced visit from the two Negro detectives , Wild Jack and Joshua Rue , who had entered through the kitchen window and had sneaked up to Butter 's room . They had stayedp356long enough to communicate to Butter the details of Oliphant 's dinner party in Georgetown Friday night . They had fled when Bridey Lamont had interrupted to declare that the hour was very late . Butter had then slapped the bed . " This is important ! " Bridey Lamont had reminded him that this was not an Army camp . Butter had said that he would be damned if he would waste another day in this bed . Bridey Lamont had reminded Butter of his collapse Wednesday night at Willard 's Hotel , the last time he had charged out on his canes ; she had further declared that the only thing worth risking his life against was his own bad judgment . Butter had then made his accusationabout Bridey 's marriage and motives . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage a widow and a friend . Meanwhile , the result was the tears and the shouting and apologizing and pleading . In the end , Bridey recovered to say that there was nothing said or done by men and women that did not look better in morning sunlight . Saturday morning , November 19 , might have improved the relationships in the house if not for several more sudden blows to harmony . First , Butter got himself dressed and downstairs to the kitchen table on his canes in order to display his recovery and strength only to find , in the copy of Friday 's New-York Tribune that Bridey had brought home for Butter and yet failed to remember to carry up to him the night before , that there was a small item that reported the sighting of a suspicious vessel , thought to be a Rebel privateer , off of Castine , Maine . Butter barked at Bridey that he was annoyed that this very significant news had been kept from him , and he demonstrated his ill-temper by grabbing at the fried eggs on Wetherbee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the caretakers who had put him on a restricted diet . This childishness moved Wetherbee to cause more trouble ; he said , " You were off your feed last night , Zee , it 's plain . That said "  --  Wetherbee piled marmalade on a hot buttered biscuit  --  " I see your troubles . " Wetherbee looked around to see if the Lamonts , busy at the stove and the water pump , were listening in ; he proceeded to whisper to Butter , " We 're not the first worn-out boys these 've rescued . " Butter did not understand what Wetherbee meant by this confidence . They were interrupted by the children sweeping into the dining room for their breakfasts ; also , Butter was distracted by trying to eat from Wetherbee 's plate without being caught ; also , Wetherbee was preoccupied trying to sneak whiskey into his coffee cup . Only after some calm had returned to the room was Wetherbee able to explain what he had learned from the stockman ,  |p357Kindermann  , about a Massachusetts major named Henderson whom the Lamonts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of lieutenants whom they had billeted last Christmas , and about a pair of Pennsylvania artillerymen whom they had put up and nursed last spring , and about the parade of other officers that had stayed here off and on . Butter listened and darkened . Wetherbee closed , " There 's good Christians in the world , Zee . There 's loneliness in the world , too . I 'm not choosing . I 'm wanting you to know . " The major intrusion to the household , however , like a series of wild blows against Butter 's conscience , and also against a chance for Butter to repair his disenchantment with Bridey Lamont , was the return of the Negro detectives . They quickly took places at the table . Joshua Rue ate each flapjack with a single bite . Billy Lamont struggled to imitate the feat . Wild Jack revealed his sweet tooth with the construction of marmalade mountains . Wetherbee amused himself by showing card tricks to Wild Jack . The Lamont women sat at opposite heads of the table and carefully observed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation by openly conducting an interview with Wild Jack about Oliphant . He expected Bridey Lamont to object , or Vera Lamont to clear the table and the room . In anticipation and out of mischievousness , Butter emphasized the potential risk in , and the necessity of his personal attention to , Oliphant 's imminent attendance of a White House levee . Wild Jack 's intelligence was as current as that morning , because his informant was the Royall household servant , Michael . Butter made Wild Jack repeat his report four times , twice for Joshua Rue and once for Butter , and once to annoy Bridey Lamont . Wetherbee yawned . Vera Lamont drank her coffee and watched the kitchen clock . Finally , Bridey Lamont said , " If you are asking me , Captain Butter , in your peculiar way , if I would be free to accompany you to the president 's levee this afternoon , I should say that it would be easy for me to get home early from the office , and it would be a welcome entertainment . " Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she is coming along to help us ! " Joshua Rue ate and hummed . Wild Jack spoke to Bridey Lamont . " We regard this as an excellent decision . Captain Butter still requires close escort , and it would avoid another accident like Wednesday 's . " Butter began a gruff objection . Wetherbee guffawed . Wild Jack remarked that Mrs. Lamont was completely informed of the affair , so why not ? Butter repeated himself about the potential peril . Wild jack said that Oliphant would be accompanied by several females himself . Butter boomed that thisp358was Secret Service business . Wetherbee retreated from the table . Vera Lamonttook up the plates . Bridey Lamont smiled . Wild Jack exchanged with Joshua Rue , and then reminded Butter that Mrs. Lamont was more officially Secret Service just now than Captain Butter was . Butter 's sulking withdrawal for the remainder of the morning did little to prepare him for the White House . He knew the problems were profound . This could be a plot against the president ! At the same time , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved for his voluntary surveillance of John Oliphant , Butter was certain that he was being mocked by those around him . Wetherbee 's attitude was tolerable , since Wetherbee 's opinion was that Butter was a fool to try to do more than survive the war with a safe , warm seat . Wild Jack , Joshua Rue , and Gouverneur Nevers in absentia were only occasionally upsetting for the assumption they seemed to hold that Butter was central to this affair but not entirely competent . It was the Lamonts whom Butter found unbearable , for their attitude that he was fragile , thick-headed , and self-destructive . Wednesday night had been an accident ! The rioters at Willard 's had knocked him down ! It took practice to learn how to wield two canes ! A most irritable and competitive Butter met Bridey Lamont at the door at 12:30 P.M. She tried to soothe him , but he refused to speak . He also refused her help out to the horsecar for the journey up Pennsylvania Avenue . His temper was not eased by the consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so handsome and needful a couple . More , the conductor was elaborately careful to keep the standing passengers clear of Butter 's legs , and to force his assistance when Butter tangled the canes getting up to disembark at Lafayette Square . And there were many kind farewell remarks from the crowd , the general sentiment best expressed by the horsecar driver , who leaned out as Butter and Bridey Lamont crossed to the White House gate to call , " God bless you both ! " Butter grimaced and grumbled . But when the charity continued inside the White House , servants offering chairs , gentlemen offering their arms to escort him into the East Room , Butter started shouting , " Get away ! " " Damned busybodies ! " " Leave me be ! " Bridey Lamont endured Butter 's misbehavior and stayed at his side despite his attempts to separate himself by swinging his canes wildly and backing against the walls . As the crowd at the levee swelled , however , and Mrs. Lincoln , Senator Sumner , and the Russian entourage made their spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Once , when ap359phalanx of dignitaries shoved bystanders aside , Bridey Lamont was thrown against Butter . She hunched up and turned to lower her head against his breast to secure the protection of his bulk until the threat had passed and she could look up to say , " I 'm sorry . " Butter stood unreconciled . He did not want to show weakness . He did want a cigar . The only way to smoke without asking Bridey Lamont 's help was to work over to a bench at the rear of the East Room . He sat , and kept Mrs. Lincoln in sight as he lit up . He knew the interior of the White House fairly well from the visits he had made the previous winter with Lafayette Baker , Majors Conger and Wetherbee , and the other captains of the First D.C. to confer upstairs with the president and the Cabinet about chasing Mosby . Back then , War Secretary Stanton had been obsessed by Mosby 's guerrilla raids , and had convinced Lincoln that any threat to Washington 's security was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now only wonder what Stanton would do if he knew that a man like John Oliphant was calling on the White House today . Butter had differed with Stanton and Baker about chasing Mosby ( he had thought burning out those suspected of aiding Mosby was stupidity ) , and Butter now differed with Baker about pursuing Oliphant . And Butter did not forget that Oliphant might represent no less a threat than Mosby . Wild Jack Goodenough was armed . It was Joshua Rue who signaled that Oliphant had entered the mansion . It was Mrs. Lamont who saw the signal and passed it on to Butter with a whisper , though she did show her excitement when she grabbed his arm to help Butter stand up . Butter and Mrs. Lamont moved into the Blue Room and to the front of the crowd that was formed in a semicircle of adulation to observe the celebrities in the Green Room . There was a long delay , and several times Butter challenged Mrs. Lamont 's certainty that she had seen the signal . She withstood his anxiety by trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman on Senator Sumner 's arm . Butter harrumphed and rocked on his canes ; at one point he stepped backwardonto Mrs. Lamont 's foot . She gasped . He apologized . She nodded . She also surprised Butter soon enough , asking , " Is that your Mr. Oliphant and Mrs. Winwood ? " Butter looked to see John Oliphant slip into the Green Room through a door in the partition behind Mrs. Lincoln . Wild Jack was suddenly in front of Butter with his right hand inside his morning coat where his revolver would be . Butter whispered loudly , " No ! " Butter pushed forward along the windowsill into the Green Room . Oliphant did not look threatening , ratherp360tentative and confused . Joshua Rue came up behind Butter , and Wild Jack was moving again stealthily through the seam of the crowd to Butter 's front . Butter stood ten feet away from Oliphant . Bridey Lamont was at Butter 's arm , asking , " What are you going to do to him ? " Mrs. Winwood was much improved from when Butter had last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Winwood seemed the center of attention of her coterie . The English brigadier and the English diplomat pressed up beside her ; her Negro servants stood in her shadow ; and Oliphant hung behind her like a protege . Mrs. Winwood was striking , yet Butter assumed there was more to her power than beauty . Wild Jack had provided all the necessary information about Oliphant 's visit here today except for the crucial motive . Why were Oliphant , Mrs. Winwood , and the rest here ? Butter studied them , and guessed wildly , and hoped that they had not come to assassinate . But what could it mean that Mrs. Lincoln was now receiving Mrs. Winwood ? Was Senator Sumner part of their plot ? Was the president going to appear and present a target ? Why was Oliphant staying back from the receiving line ? Was Oliphant armed ? And what could Butter do about this situation if he had to ? Could he attack Oliphant with his canes ? But why was Oliphant here ? Butter reminded himself of his firmest convictionabout the Rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be dangerous too . " Pardon , suh , pardon ? " It was the Negro boy who was with Oliphant ; he was addressing Butter . He asked , " Is President Lincoln comin ' ? Can you tell me when ? Please ? " Butter was unable to react . The boy wandered away to the window . The boy spoke to Oliphant , and Oliphant answered him . Oliphant seemed anxiousbut paternal , dividing his attention between watching the boy and watching Mrs. Winwood . " Golly ! " the boy burst suddenly . " Ai n't he ? Ai n't he ? " Oliphant turned to the window ; he spoke to the boy . " We shall see him later , Jim , we will . " And then Bridey Lamont was with Oliphant and the boy ! Butter could not hear what she was saying , or what Oliphant replied . She laughed . Oliphant bowed . Bridey Lamont declared , " Oh , if you could only see it in the spring ! " Then she was back at Butter 's side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be thinking ? " Bridey Lamont said , " He 's most charming , Amaziah , truly , and kind , veryp361kind . I wanted to know . Do n't be angry , please ? " Butter started , " No , no  --  " and saw all at once what had to be done . It was a sudden vision , acutely clear in conception , and yet just as quickly it transformed into a vagueness that was nonetheless compelling . Butter 's convictionfollowed , and provided him a strength of purpose that felt God-sent . It also put words in his mouth . As Mrs. Lincoln retired with the Russians , as Oliphant shook off Mrs. Winwood 's beckoning and drifted out of the East Room , Butter began moving and giving orders . Outside again , on the White House 's portico , Butter and Bridey Lamont faced each other with the familiarity of the long wed . He let her button up his greatcoat and wrap his scarf . She took hold of him to help him past the grand Russian coach and up onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on Oliphant . Oliphant was standing with his back to them some yards ahead , near the statue of Thomas Jefferson . Bridey Lamont glanced toward Oliphant , then stepped in front of Butter . She said , " You wo n't hurt him , will you ? Please do n't . " Butter replied , " You know what he 's part of . You can go home if you want . " " I 'm not leaving . I think I should see what this is that I am part of . " Butter considered an impolitic and rude reply . Bridey Lamont had a forceful soul , though , and that meant she was probably more than he could hope to control or fend off just now . Butter leaned into his canes and set out across the lawn . Oliphant was reading a piece of paper . It looked to Butter like a telegram . Butter glanced once more at Bridey Lamont beside him , and then he began speaking from five yards away . " Mr. John Oliphant ? " Oliphant did not react . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This time Oliphant did turn around . He put the telegram in his pocket and took his pipe out of his mouth . He said , " Yes ? " Butter continued , " Mr. John Oliphant ? "  --  he was within a yard now , and stopped heavily  --  " I am Captain Butter , of the  --  of the **30;13473;TOOLONG at the War Department . " Butter hesitated ; he had confused himself . Should he have said Secret Service ? 1 ) id it matter ? Butter thought , I do n't want to be Secret Service . I like being Captain Butter of the United States Volunteers . Oliphant also hesitated , but he did not look to be surprised . He startedp362speaking then , flatly and calmly . " Am I under arrest ? I do n't mean impertinence . But  --  I do n't want to argue . You see , I have some people that I should let know . My family . Inside the President 's House . " " Why are you here today , Mr. Oliphant ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What ? " Now Oliphant looked surprised . Butter pressed . " Answer me . Do you intend to harm Mr. Lincoln ? " " No , no , " said Oliphant . " It 's my family . They 're inside . We 've come here today to seek the president 's favor . It 's about my father-in-law . We 're trying to get his coffin home , to bury him in South Carolina , and  --  " Oliphant 's voice thickened , and he breathed deeply as he continued . " And to ask the president to stop the killing in Georgia . I know this sounds odd . But my wife and children are in Savannah , and General Sherman  --  I 'm trying to answer you . The answer to your question "  --  Oliphant sighed once more  --  " is that I am here today for mercy 's sake . Also , for peace . It 's true , for peace . " Butter snapped , " You are a Rebel agent , Mr. Oliphant . I know what you have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has not been peaceful . What part have you to play in the Rebel conspiracy ? Is there now to be an attack on the capital ? Is Mosby part of your plot ? You must tell me . " " Mosby ? God , no ! I am here with my sister-in-law . She  --  " " Once more , sir . What is your part in this conspiracy ? " " I have nothing to do with a plot against President Lincoln . Or with Mosby . I am not a soldier . I am a man of business . My wife 's family is Southern . My father 's family is Northern . I am an American citizen . I am telling the truth . " Butter moved closer to Oliphant , placing the tips of his canes before each of Oliphant 's boot 's toes . He stared down at him as best he could given the angle of his own posture . " I know about New-York . I know the names and whereabouts of each of your party  --  Kennedy , Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook , Dennis . I know the shop on Washington Place . I know the Sons of Liberty . I know your house in Georgetown , and your association with the Englishmen , and your associations at the French embassy . I know of the townhouse in London , and of Mrs. Winwood 's work in the Rebel Secret Service , for Mr. Mason . I know of the Royalls in Beaufort , and of Brigadier-General Winwood . I know all , sir , all , exceptp363what I have asked . And I do not accept your answers . What I must have is the truth . It is the only thing that might help you now . But I ca n't make promises about your future . " Oliphant was as still as Jefferson 's statue . The wind ruffled his clothes . He remained dumb . Butter was satisfied for the moment . He had not expected to get what he wanted in one assault . He had meant to show his enemy the breadth of the battlefield , the weight of the opposing forces , and the improbabilityof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any experiencedcommander , Butter had used as much bluff as firepower . So far , however , he had only peppered from long range . It was time to flush with action across a wide front . Butter gestured toward Bridey Lamont . " This is Mrs. Lamont , " said Butter , " also of the War Department . And behind you are two more of my colleagues . I would like you to come along now . Butter lifted his fingers in a signal . Joshua Rue came up with Oliphant 's coat , hat , and walking cane . Oliphant took them slowly , and as he pulled them on he looked to the White House , then to the vaulting gray sky , then to Wild Jack standing apart from them a little , yet vigilantly , a tiny figure in a cold green field smoking his pipe with persuasive intensity . Oliphant finished his gloves and turned to Bridey Lamont . " We have already met , " Oliphant said , bowing . " I forget myself , Mrs. Lamont . I am sorry , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Oliphant , " and cupped her hands together . " Would there be a chance , " he continued , " that you could tell the boy , Jim , that I have been arrested ? No , do n't say that . That I am away ? Yes , you could say I have been called away . Mrs. Lamont , it would be a great favor . " Butter pointed a cane toward the front gate . " Forget that , now . You are n't arrested until I say you are . We 're going now . " Oliphant took a step and somehow misjudged the flower plot about the statue 's pedestal . He smashed down a small new branch of a cut-back rose bush . He froze , and delicately pulled back his foot , so that he was looking down at the damage when he began , " There is n't someone else taking Mrs. Winwood , is there ? Mrs. Winwood is most certainly not part of any conspiracy . She is a peace commissioner . She knows nothing of whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " Bridey Lamont shook her head . Butter barked , " This is between you and me , Mr. Oliphant , and I 'd appreciate your full attention ! " Butter saw Brideyp364Lamont wince , and he also saw Oliphant 's pain . He relented enough to add , " I 'm not making war on women and children , like some , if that 's what you need to know . " Oliphant said , " It is , and thank you . " They left the White House grounds in a sedate procession . Joshua Rue strode next to Oliphant ; Butter and Bridey Lamont strolled right behind . Up ahead , Wild Jack had crossed to the center of Lafayette Square , in front of Andrew Jackson 's statue , and was awaiting the approaching horsecarfourtired horses hauling a shabby car that overflowed with shoppers and military men . There was a rush of those getting on from the White House side . It was easier mounting from the Square , and Butter again found that his invalidhoodcleared a wide space . An elderly man offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . In the indecisiveness that followed , Butter ended up seated next to Bridey , with Oliphant standing at Butter 's shoulder and Joshua Rue towering behind , while Wild Jack inserted himself beneath the parcels held by two matrons . The car lurched onward . The conductor slipped through the jam to collect money for tickets . Butter was prepared to pay for all five in his party ; however , the conductor sagged at Butter 's dollar bill . Oliphant was quick to provide the correct coins . Butter twisted back to say , " Thanks , " only to see that Oliphant 's expression was far away . Bridey Lamont whispered to Butter , " Where are we going ? Ca n't you tell me ? It does n't help that you 're sullen , and so curt to him . " " What ? " Why was she angry with him ? He replied , " The Capitol buildingfirst . " " Can you arrest him ? What about Colonel Baker ? " Butter did not have a good answer , and ignored the issue by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right toward West Fifteenth Street in front of the cracked and chipped brick facade of the aged State Department building , where there were a few supplicants climbing the stone steps like worried insects . And then the car rumbled past the Treasury building only to halt again for the boarding of exhausted women just escaped from their shift at Treasury 's Counting Room . From here , down the flat , straight mile and a quarter to Capitol Hill , Pennsylvania Avenue made wartime Washington as much a prosperous village as the so-called national one . Along here the military was briefly outnumbered by what served as Washington 's society  --  as badly and plainly dressed as it was  --  who were outp365to see , to shop , and to be seen . The mood was inquisitive and not entirely sober . And the autumnal colors of the deciduous trees lining the avenue like sentinels blessed the idling and the rushing , and concealed some of the mud with gay pastels . Willard 's Hotel on the left was the usual continual hubbub , and the matinee at the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of West Thirteenth . On the right , through the openings in the hodge-podge of houses and shops off Ohio Avenue , backing on the open sewer of the Tiber Creek canal , one could spy the pinnacles of the gothic towers of the Smithsonian Institution above the treeline , like a lost sandcastle . And on the left , Bridey Lamont darted a look at her shop , but was blocked by the crush in the car and the looming breadth of Joshua Rue . The conduct in the horsecar depended upon the district : It was pretentious for the hotel crowd , cheery for the theater crowd , and actually combative for those looking toward the excitement at the Centre Market between West Ninth and West Seventh . The car crawled through the chaos of wagons at the open-air stalls of the market . Passengers were now attacking and under attack as they tried to find a place . A young mother wrestled two children into her lap on the bench across from Butter ; the baby was indifferent to all ; the boy kicked playfully at Butter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel and the National Hotel , Butter became impatient with the progress . He stood up as the car started the creaking climb around to the northwest slope of Capitol Hill . And at the New Jersey Avenue stop halfway up the incline , Butter slid down from the car . This was also the closest stop to the Baltimore Railroad Depot , so Bridey Lamont had to struggle to get down with half the rest of the passengers . She laughed for her escape . And then they were off again , with Joshua Rue , Oliphant , and Wild Jack trailing . The Capitol building sat white and commanding above them . Butter paused frequently to rest , spinning around to take heart from the panorama . It was twilight , and the grand smear of red sunlight highlighted the streaked gray clouds in the western sky above the gray Potomac and the orange and brown carpet of trees . The only man-made creation that caught the eye was a broken obelisk that was actually the unfinished monument to George Washington. l3ridey Lamont spoke to Butter . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butter turned from her to look back at Oliphant , and frowned . Hecontinued his slow ascent . They were before the north wing of the Capitol , the Senate chamber ; it was largely darkened , the Thirty-eighth Congress stillp366recessed for the Election . The whole Capitol building was in the last stages of a rejuvenation and transformation . The Senate wing was still wrapped with a wooden scaffolding , because they had not finished whitewashing the facade . And there were construction supplies and all manner of rubbish across the mall . A full paint bucket must have fallen from above to where Butter now stood , because he was on the edge of a cracked white pool . Butter poked a cane at the paint chips and waited for Oliphant to get up close to him ; Butter said , " You say you 're a citizen , Mr. Oliphant . Does this place mean anything to you ? " " You mean the Capitol ? " asked Oliphant . " It is the apex of the country . " Butter could see that Oliphant wanted to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moved around the Senate steps and swung rhythmically on his canes across the mall to the foot of the central stairs . Butter looked up above to the year-old and still incomplete Capitol dome . And when Oliphant neared him , Butter turned . " If you mean it 's the heart of our democracy , I 'll hear you out . " " Yes , of course , the metaphor is unimportant , " said Oliphant ; he opened his arms . " I should say , the metaphor is profound . Head and heart , the head and heart of the country , where we think and where we feel . We are in agreement . The intellect and the emotions are not neighbors . They are the same , the same . " Butter said , " Like the North and the South . " " Yes , yes . " Oliphant smiled . " I shall not underestimate you again . May I try again ? " Butter grunted . Oliphant continued . " My father brought me here when I was ten years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and these wings were n't even contemplated . You could see the brick face . There were more trees too , and the park out there was overgrown . I 'm remembering from a child 's mind . I thought it all magical . The biggest building , the most exciting place . Like the Parthenon for Alexander . I have seen the Versailles Palace now , as a grown man , and I know that my feelings once upon a time just here are incomparable . I remember huge men with hoary faces and godlike voices . And there was a pack of wild dogs out there in the woods that day , runaways mostly . I saw a man stand up there on the steps and shoot at them with a long rifle . My father was a pastor from Philadelphia , who had come down to lead a prayer before Congress . On the schooner Mayflower , my first sea voyage ! After that man shot the dog , my father stood me right here and said that he wanted me to come back here someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , I was never to carryp367a weapon . I was to devote myself to ensuring that no man ever need come here armed . This is a place of peace and debate and fair-mindedness , he said , and when the guns come out , men can not hear themselves talk . For years , I thought he meant it . Even now , if I touch a gun , I have trouble hearing . My ears ring . " Butter scraped a heel . " I 've had that problem . " " Yes , " said Oliphant , " yes , yes . I 'm rambling . I apologize . You indulge me . To answer you succinctly , and from the heart , this is the first and last for me . It can make me weep . I 'm sentimental . It 's an inheritance . " Butter saw Oliphant had Bridey Lamont 's attention . Butter turned away and began the ascent up the central stairs . He moved sideways at first , then back and forth like a mechanical man toward the colonnaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bales outside the main door . Butter cantilevered himself up into the shelter of the columns and leaned hard against a crate , gasping and sweating , but triumphant . Bridey Lamont did not hesistate to come up to wipe Butter 's face . Oliphant offered his handkerchiefas well . Butter permitted their care until the throbbing in his hips abated , and then he got himself away from them and up to the main door . Wild Jack opened the way . The rotunda was overgrown with trash . There were also heaps of drop cloths and stacks of boxes . The major presence , however , was a wood-built superstructure that rose up into the dome like a mockery of the Tower of Babel . The whole party stood beneath the catwalks , peeking upward two hundred feet to the pale silver glow of the dome 's windows . The smell was of paint , turpentine , and the lingering odor of the workmen , for while the dome had been topped and dedicated , it was far from finished . The single sound was dripping water , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dome in a storm . Bridey Lamont pointed up , and said , " It should be beautiful , if they ever finish . " " I had thought it would be more like a cathedral than it is , " said Oliphant . " Like the Duomo in Florence . I see now it is going to be less sublime , more open  --  a crossroads and not a place of worship . " " My husband , David , said that too . " Bridey Lamont stepped away ; she had her arm and finger up in the air a moment until she rotated and pointed down at the marble floor . " 1 le brought me here when we first arrived . The dome was still open at the top then . After Christmas in 1861 . There was the same mess here , though . David said that he wept , like you said , Mr. Oliphant ,
