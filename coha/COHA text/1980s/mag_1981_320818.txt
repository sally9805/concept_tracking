In Boston , a definitive retrospective of Camille Pissarro <P> In art , each generation has to reinvent the past : to construct its own Watteau , even its own Leonardo . The new outlines never quite coincide with the old . This is true of modern art , too , which itself has become old ; and it even applies to impressionism , the most accessible , popular modern movement of all . Sometimes later styles " reinterpret " earlier ones , as abstract expressionism fostered the present veneration of the late works of Monet . <P> Then there are some artists whose reputations gratuitously disappear and subsequently rise again , wobbling in and out of historical focus . The outstanding example of these , among the impressionists , was Camille Pissarro ( 1830-1903 ) . <P> Pissarro was the least spectacular of the impressionists . An eye used to Monet ( and Monet is what many people believe impressionism was all about ) will be apt to find Pissarro conservative-more of a tonal painter , almost , than a colorist . <P> There has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , Gauguin 's irritable verdict that Pissarro was a good second-rater , " always wanting to be on top of the latest trend ... he 's lost any kind of personality , and his work lacks unity . " So although there has been no lack of Degas shows , Monet retrospectives , homages to Czanne and museum tributes to Bazille or Caillebotte , Pissarro has remained less known-an irony , since , with his peculiar steadfastness and probity , he was the linchpin of the impressionist group . <P> Now , at Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts , the long process of rehabilitating Pissarro has begun with the first retrospective of his work ever held in the U.S. : 81 paintings and 113 drawings and prints , as well as souvenirs of his life , assembled by a team of five art historians ( two French , one English , two American ) . Already seen at the Hayward Gallery in London and the Grand Palais in Paris , this is the definitive show of an artist without whom the workings of the French avant-garde between 1870 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the avant-garde 's oak-tree uncles : a man of enormous solidity and forthrightness , blunt in speech , loyal to his friends and open to younger artists . He loved to organize , teach , and argue and work with other painters , and the list of artists who owed him some part of their self-knowledge was long . <P> Czanne , nine years his junior , called him " a man to consult , and something like le bon Dieu " - meaning not the vengeful God of judgment but a kindly and paternal deity , the supervisor of hearths and gardens : in a word , the god of growth . <P> Mary Cassatt remarked that " he could have taught stones to draw correctly . " <P> Though immersed in the metropolitan culture of France , Pissarro lived at an angle to it . He was not only an immigrant - he had been born and raised on the Caribbean island of St. Thomas , the son of a well-off storekeeper-he was also a Jew . In this sense he was twice a stranger in France , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family , his extreme probity and political radicalism were connected , one may surmise , to his sense of outsidership . More than anything else , he loved painting .
