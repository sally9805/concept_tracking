Probing submarine contracts and an admiral 's gifts <P> Hyman Rickover , father of the nuclear navy , friend of congressional committee chairmen , was accustomed to getting his way with defense contractors . Once , according to congressional investigators , while visiting General Dynamics ' Electric Boat shipyard in Groton , Conn. , the crusty admiral admired a horn-handled fruit knife and idly declared that he would like to have a dozen of them . Shipyard executives hopped to . The handle was shipped off to a General Dynamics ' lab , where analysis revealed that it had been made from the horn of a rare Southeast Asian buffalo . More buffalo horn was sent for , and a dozen fruit knives were manufactured for the admiral at a boatyard normally devoted to building submarines . <P> Almost any Rickover whim , it appears , was the contractor 's command . When Rickover , who wore cheap metal tie clasps , saw one that he liked better on the tie of a General Dynamics employee-even when it was gold-he simply reached over and made a quick trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reputation of Rickover , 84 , who retired in 1982 after 59 years in the Navy . To executives at General Dynamics , such favors were part of the cost of doing business and keeping the cantankerous admiral happy . But to congressional budget cutters eyeing the Defense Department for excess fat , they are part of a broader investigation into charges that General Dynamics fleeced the Government of hundreds of millions in cost overruns . Those and other allegations have drawn the attention of investigators from five congressional committees , the Navy , the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission . <P> Navy Secretary John Lehman disclosed last month that the Navy had evidence that during the 1970s and early ' 80s Rickover received gifts worth " tens of thousands " of dollars , not only from General Dynamics but also from General Electric , Westinghouse and Newport News Shipbuilding &; Dry-dock Co. , all big Navy contractors . Among the presents : a $695 pair of diamond earrings mounted on 18-karat gold and a $430 jade necklace . Rickover says those baubles went to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trinkets " - gold pendants , desk sets , ship models-on to Congressmen and then wives . <P> " I took , " Rickover admitted on the CBS program 60 Minutes last week . " So did others . I do n't deny it . " But " the question that ought to be asked , " insisted Rickover , " is , Did I ever favor General Dynamics or any other contractor ? " In fact , Rickover was known for leaning on contractors to meet deadlines , budgets and quality specifications . It was he who triggered a formal investigation of General Dynamics for cost overruns in 1978 . The probe , carried out by the Justice Department , produced no indictments and was dropped in 1981 . <P> Meanwhile , the Navy settled with General Dynamics , paying $634 million of $843 million in excess costs claimed by the company for construction of the SSN-688 Los Angeles-class attack submarines . Rickover bitterly criticized the settlement .
