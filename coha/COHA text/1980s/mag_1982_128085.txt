Patrick Division // How good are the NEW YORK ISLANDERS ? If you took their four best players and put them on the dark side of the moon , the Islanders would still be one of the top four teams in the NHL . So much for depth . Bring those players back  --  Denis Potvin , Mike Bossy , Bryan Trottier and Bill Smith  --  and you have a dynasty . The question is n't whether the Islanders will win their fourth straight Stanley Cup , but rather , how can they fail ? Talent , discipline , speed , toughness , character , coaching  --  you could go on and on . The only way this team can lose is to be stopped cold by a goaltender  --  as Pittsburgh 's Michel Dion nearly did last spring in the first round of the playoffs . Moreover , the Islanders have traded for New Jersey 's first-round 1983 draft choice , which could turn out to be the top pick . The only weakness on this club is its slogan : BRING FOURTH THE CUP . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become comfortable playing under Coach Herb Brooks ' system of constant motion , but by the playoffs they may well have been the second-best team in the league . Barry Beck seems on the verge of becoming the NHL 's top defenseman , and if Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson can stay healthy  --  they played four games between them in 1981-82 , when both underwent knee surgery  --  the offense will be much improved . Goalie John Davidson played only two games last season because of a bad back , and the Rangers are hoping he can return to the form he showed in 1978-79 , when he led the Rangers past the Islanders and into the Stanley Cup finals . It could happen again . // To add mobility to their sluggish defense , the PHILADELPHIA FLYERS traded pesty Ken Linseman to Hartford for Mark Howe , long considered one of the game 's most promising players . Howe , who 's 27 now , is at the crossroads , and it will be interesting to see whether he plays at the level that has always been expected of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow pros , Bobby Clarke and Darryl Sittler , and 22-year-old Ron Flockhart , who last season added a strange new dimension to the Philadelphia attack  --  speed . The fans in the Spectrum were so shocked , they thought up a name for it : Flocky Hockey . Gone are the days of the Broad Street Bullies  --  Rocky Hockey  --  as the Flyers try to change their image . // Already a shoo-in for Executive of the Year honors is David Poile , rookie GM for the WASHINGTON CAPITALS . Within 10 days of taking the job , he plucked the panicky Canadiens of their defense with a deal that might make the Caps the most improved team in hockey . Poile sent Rick Green and Ryan Walter to Montreal for Rod Langway and Brian Engblom , two of the NHL 's best defensemen , and Doug Jarvis , a legendary face-off specialist who plays Trottier tougher than any other center . Trots now will see him seven times a season instead of three . Complementing the instant defense will be a plethora of goals . One-way player Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bobby Carpenter had 32 . Over the summer Washington acquired 31-year-old Milan Novy , the top Czechoslovakian scorer of all time . Pat Riggin , who came from Calgary , is only so-so in goal , but Washington has enough going for it to make the playoffs for the first time . // Which means the PITTSBURGH PENGUINS will miss them . Pittsburgh has a fine coach in Eddie Johnston , an All-Star goalie in Dion , and a power play that scored a league-record 99 goals last season . Beyond that , the Penguins have too many holes . One telling stat : This was the first year that the Penguins have had a first-and a second-round draft choice since 1976. // Do n't look for the 1,800-mile shift East from Denver to improve the NEW JERSEY DEVILS , the sorriest team in the league . Instead of having the top pick in this year 's amateur draft , they had Forward Dwight Foster , for whom they had dealt the choice to Boston in the summer of ' 81 . Foster 's plus-minus performance last season was-53 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one in which they traded their first choice in 1983 to the Islanders ( for Bob Lorimer ) , Coach and General Manager Billy MacMillan pulled off a real biggie . He traded his one high-quality skater , Rob Ramage , to St. Louis for the Blues ' No. 1 pick this year and next . MacMillan used St. Louis ' 1982 selection to obtain Rocky Trottier , Bryan 's brother . But Rocky missed most of last season with an injured knee , and the knee went kaput again in training camp . // Adams Division // The player the BOSTON BRUINS selected with New Jersey 's first choice was 18-year-old Gord Kluzak , a defenseman who goes 6 ' 4 " , 221 . Skating around him on the tiny Boston Garden rink is going to be no mean feat . Defense is the team 's forte , with Ray Bourque , Mike Milbury , Mike O'Connell and Brad Park . Goaltending , a minus last season , will be much improved with the addition of Pete Peeters and 20-year-old Mike Moffat . But Boston needs to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last season only five clubs scored fewer power-play goals than the Bruins , who had 65 . Rick Middleton had 51 goals in 1981-82 , and rookie Center Barry Pederson scored 44 . However , the typical Boston goal is still a rebound off the shinbone. // The success formula for the MONTREAL CANADIENS used to be : Win the Vezina Trophy ( least goals allowed ) and you 'll win the Stanley Cup . It has n't worked the past two years ; the Canadiens were humiliated in the first round of postseason play in both 1980-81 and 1981-82 despite giving up the fewest goals in the regular season . Now , Managing Director Irving Grundman has evidently scrapped the formula . The day after he made The Trade that sent Rod Langway , Brian Engblom , Doug Jarvis and Craig Laughlin to Washington , Grundman dealt Doug Risebrough , a solid defensive forward , to Calgary for second- and third-round draft choices . " How are we going to get the puck out of our end ? " asks Goalie Rick Wamsley . Good question . Grundman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three inexperienced defensemen who 'll give veteran Larry Robinson fits . The Canadiens expect Ryan Walter , who arrived with Rick Green from Washington , to kill penalties , beef up their power play and rejuvenate Guy Lafleur , who has slumped to 27 goals in each of his last two injury-plagued seasons . Lafleur threatened to play this season in Japan unless his contract was renegotiated . Montreal complied , but Lafleur may still wish he 'd slipped into his kimono and gone . // The team that ruined Montreal 's summer vacation was the QUEBEC NORDIQUES who followed their playoff upset of the Canadiens with a stunning defeat of Boston . Leading the Nordiques are the Stastnys three , Peter , Anton and Marian , who staged a fraternal wildcat strike in training camp in an effort to renegotiate their contracts . Quebec has offered to talk to Peter  --  one of the truly great players in hockey  --  but has said ne to Anton and Marian . The Nordiques have one of the league 's most potent offenses , with Michel Goulet ( 42 goals ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) adding some French flair to the Czech connection . But if Quebec is to climb in the standings , it will have to cut down on its goals-against , which stood at 345 in 1981-82 . Dan Bouchard , the goalie , is a streak player , and if he gets hot in the playoffs , the Nordiques could beat anyone . // The big story out of the BUFFALO SABRES ' training camp this fall was Phil Housley , the club 's No. 1 draft choice . Coach and General Manager Scotty Bowman has called him " the nearest thing to Bobby Orr I 've seen . " Not bad for an 18-year-old kid from St. Paul . Housley is only 5 ' 10 " , 180 pounds , but he should find a spot on the team , which Bowman is in the process of rebuilding . Housley can play either center or defense . Bowman seems to like versatility . He has alternated between coaching and managing the Sabres over the past three years , with the apparent result that he has done neither job well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are that Assistant Coach Red Berenson will take over by New Year 's . The Sabres ' biggest shortcoming last season was lack of firepower . Mike Foligno and Dale McCourt had 33 goals apiece , followed by Gil Perreault 's 31 . However , Buffalo was 16th in scoring overall . Do n't look for much from the Sabres for two or three years , when the young players begin to mature . // Speaking of teams not to look for  --  ladies and gentlemen , we give you the HARTFORD WHALERS . Last year Hartford traded its top draft choice for over-the-hill Rick MacLeish , and by midseason MacLeish was gone . This summer 's gem was Mark Howe for Ken Linseman , whom the Whalers promptly dealt to Edmonton for Risto Siltanen . Risto Siltanen ? For Mark Howe ? Golly , golly , golly . For excitement , Hartford fans will be able to watch Blaine Stoughton and Pierre Larouche try to find their way back into the defensive zone while the team struggles to match the 21-41-18 record it had each of the last two seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the playoffs , the EDMONTON OILERS vs. the Los Angeles Kings , who had finished 48 points behind Edmonton . The series is tied at one game each . Score : 4-0 Oilers in the second period . The Kings are struggling during a man-up situation . Suddenly the Edmonton bench begins booing the Los Angeles power play . Cocky ? You bet . Immature ? You said it . After giving up yet another goal , the Kings come back to win 6-5 . They go on to steal the series three games to two . All that 's sad about the Oilers ' collapse is that it tarnished Wayne Gretzky 's stunning season ( 92 goals , 120 assists , 212 points  --  all records ) , the likes of which may never be seen again . But Gretzky was no one-man gang . Glenn Anderson had 105 points , Mark Messier scored 50 goals and the Oilers ' 417 goals set an NHL record . " Maybe we concentrated too much on the records , " says Coach and GM Glen Sather . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year that he did last . " We shall see . Other priorities include getting Defenseman Paul Coffey ( 29 goals ) to perform as superbly as he did in the first half of 1981-82 and Goalie Grant Fuhr , who had a shoulder operation this summer , back into shape . Ken Linseman was acquired in August to add playoff spark , but he might end up just adding penalty minutes . Already he has been suspended for the first four games for eye-gouging in an exhibition game . The key is still Gretzky . In games in which he scored a goal last season , the Oilers were 40-6-9 . When he was shut out , Edmonton was 8-11-6. // The new coach of the CALGARY FLAMES is Badger Bob Johnson , who guided Wisconsin to three NCAA titles . Johnson has one of the finest hockey minds in the world . He also has lots of good forwards , including Lanny McDonald ( 40 goals ) , Mel Bridgman ( 33 ) , Kevin LaVallee ( 32 ) , Jim Peplinski ( 30 ) and Kent Nilsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved , thanks to the arrival of Don Edwards . The weakness will be defense , which has little depth behind Phil Russell , Richie Dunn and Paul Reinhart . Convincing the Flames that anybody can play defense if he works his tail off will be Johnson 's greatest challenge . // The challenge facing VANCOUVER CANUCKS Coach Roger Neilson ? How to keep Vancouverites from falling asleep while watching his team . Neilson 's clutch-and-grab tactics work wonders in the playoffs , but over 80 games they wear thin . Still , Vancouver , which has n't played .500-or-better hockey since 1975-76 , may do so this year . Thomas Gradin ( 37 goals ) should get offensive help from rookies Patrik Sundstrom and Moe Lemay , and he 'll need it ; Vancouver was 18th in goals scored last season . On defense , Tiger Williams and Harold Snepsts will bang heads , but if Canuck fans think Goalie Richard Brodeur can carry this group of over-achievers to the Stanley Cup finals for the second straight year , they 'll wind up crying into their towels . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in league history , leaping from nine wins in 1980-81 to 33 . The going will be tougher this time around , primarily because the Jets are now in the Smythe Division , and thus will have eight fewer games against feckless Toronto and Detroit . Winnipeg is still on the rise , however . Last season 's Rookie of the Year , Dale Hawerchuk , 19 , has put on 15 pounds of muscle and weighs 190 , and Morris Lukowich ( 43 goals , 49 assists ) keeps improving . On defense , Serge Savard will hobble out for one more season , but the pivotal player is Dave Babych , once dubbed The Franchise , a title he cheerfully bequeathed to Hawerchuk . If the Jets repeat last year 's .500 effort , the season will be considered a success . // Which could well leave the LOS ANGELES KINGS out in the cold . One of the team 's difficulties is that it 's hard to concentrate on hockey in Southern California , where nobody really gives a damn about the sport . Another difficulty is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had jet lag . Coach Don Perry , who 'll be starting his first full season in L.A. , is a no-nonsense type who might change some of this , but , Lord , what a row to hoe ! The Kings were 20th in the NHL last year in goals against . The offense again will rely on Marcel Dionne , who had his fourth consecutive 50-goal season in 1981-82 , and Dave Taylor , who had better than 100 points for the second year in a row . Charlie Simmer is trying to regain the form he displayed in 1980-81 , when he had his second straight 56-goal year but broke his right leg near the end of the season . He scored just 15 goals in 50 games last year . Until the Kings figure out how to reduce the number of rebounds caroming off Goalie Mario Lessard  --  and going in  --  they 'll just lose a lot of games 6-4. // Norris Division // The MINNESOTA NORTH STARS , after making the Stanley Cup finals in 1981 , came up with the slogan : so CLOSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Stars tasted in last season 's playoffs were lumber and elbow pads , courtesy of Chicago , which beat Minnesota in the first round . To add beef and gristle to his stylish team , G.M. Lou Nanne dealt Steve Christoff to Calgary for 6 ' 3 " , 205-pound Willi Plett , who has averaged 25 goals and 211 penalty minutes the last six seasons . But the biggest news is highly touted Forward Brian Bellows , the second choice overall in the draft . He should help keep the North Stars near the top for years . Goalie Don Beaupre had a sophomore slump last season , and Minnesota needs him to return to form to take some of the burden off 11-year veteran Gilles Meloche . On defense , Craig Hartsburg and Curt Giles are bona fide performers , but the North Stars must have oft-injured Gary Sargent at full strength to make a run at the Cup . // The gutsiest gamble of the summer was made by Emile Francis , president and coach of the ST . LOUIS BLUES . He traded two first-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-year pro who 's only 23 . Ramage was a bust with the Rockies because he tried to do too much . That wo n't be a problem with the Blues . Near the end of the season Francis acquired Guy Lapointe from Montreal , and he helped shore up the defense . Bernie Federko sparks the offense , which suffered in 1981-82 , when Wayne Babych slipped from 54 goals to 19 . Taking up the slack was Joe Mullen ( 25 goals in 45 games ) . Brian Sutter gives the Blues toughness and heart , but what they need most is Goalie Mike Liut to regain his All-Star stature of 1980-81 . If he does , St. Louis could surprise Minnesota in the playoffs. // Which is about the only thing the BLACK HAWKS did right last year . Despite having Norris Trophy ( best defenseman ) winner Doug Wilson , who had 39 goals and 46 assists , the Hawks allowed 363 goals . Only two teams yielded more . Where do you point the finger ? Start with the coach and the goaltenders . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magnuson with Orval Tessier , who last season guided Chicago 's minor league team in New Brunswick to the AHL 's best defensive record . He 'll help . But Goalie Tony Esposito no longer can do it all by himself , and Murray Bannerman is n't a front-line netminder . The Hawks will do plenty of scoring , though . Denis Savard is the NHL 's most exciting one-on-one player , and Ken Yaremchuk , the team 's top draft pick , is said to be even speedier . Still , Chicago is a long way from any sort of championship . // The best news of the summer ? Bruce Norris sold the DETROIT RED WINGS , who had missed the playoffs 10 of the last 11 years under his erratic hand . The new owner is Mike Hitch , founder of the Little Caesars pizza chain . One of the first moves by Hitch , who paid a reported $10 million for the Wings , was to hire G.M. Jimmy Devellano and Coach Nick Polano . Devellano , the Islanders ' assistant GM last year , says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did  --  through the draft . That will require patience . At the moment Detroit is strongest in defense , which features Jim Schoenfield , Reed Larson and Willie Huber . To bolster an offense lacking a 30-goal scorer last season , Detroit acquired 12-year veteran Reggie Leach ( 366 goals ) . The Wings ' new direction , coupled with the fact that Winnipeg has moved into the Smythe Division , may be enough to bag them one of the NHL 's 16,000 playoff berths . // The only team Detroit has to finish ahead of is the TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS . Except for 54-goal-scorer Rick Vaive and 18-year-old Defenseman Gary Nylund , the third player selected in this year 's draft , Toronto is bereft of quality . Defenseman Borje Salming , who began the influx of Swedish players into the NHL in 1973 , is just going through the motions these days . Unless Mike Nykoluk can get him to start playing with intensity again , Nykoluk may be the first coach fired this season .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
