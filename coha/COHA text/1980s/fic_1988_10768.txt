her shoulder , Duke raised up on to his hind legs , uttering one shrill query . She could feel him sag as he received an answer , and he gave a little moan , almost a sob , she thought . She reached up to stroke him . He nuzzled her hand as if he appreciated her sympathy . She could feel the tension in his small frame , and in the way his feet gripped her pullover . Once again she was glad that her mother had reinforced the fabric to prevent his claws from puncturing through to her skin . She turned her head , rubbing his side with her cheek . Everyone watched as Sean made his way toward the camp . Soon his bundle could be distinguished as layers of wide leaves , closely wrapped and bound with green climber vine . He was aware of their scrutiny and he looked tired . Sorka thought he also looked unhappy . He came right up to the two scientists and carefully deposited his bundle by Pol . " There you are . Two of'em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs . Had to search both nests to find some that snakes had n't sucked dry . " Pol laid one hand on Sean 's offering . " Thank you , Sean . Thank you very much . Are the two . . . from a gold 's clutch or a green 's ? " " Gold 's , of course , " Sean said with a disgusted snort . " Greens rarely hatch . They 're snake-eaten . I got there just in time . " He looked almost challengingly at Sorka . She did not know what to say . " So did Sorka , " Jim Tillek replied proudly , nodding to Bay . Only then did Sean see the sleeping dragonet . A fleeting look of surprise , admiration , and annoyance crossed his face , and he sat down with a thump . Sorka did not quite meet his eyes . " I did n't do as well , " she heard herself saying . " I did n't get what we were sent after . You did . " Sean grunted , his face expressionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bronze in a rapid fire of cheeps , chirps , and murmurs . Then each gave a flip to its wings to close them back and settled in the sun to catch the warming rays . " Chow 's up , " Jim Tillek said . He began filling plates with fried fish and rings of one of the fruit nuts that was improved by cooking.  | " So , Ongola , what have you to report ? " Paul Benden asked . Emily Boll poured a measure of Benden 's precious brandy into three glasses and passed them around before taking her own seat . Ongola used the interval to organize his thoughts . The three had gathered , as they often did , in the meteorology tower beside the landing grid now used by the sleds and the one shuttle that had been altered for sparing use as a cargo carrier . Both admiral and governor , naturally pale of skin , had become almost as brown as the swarthy Ongola . All three had worked hard in the fields , in the mountains , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's endeavors . Once the colonists took up their stake acres and Landing 's purpose had been accomplished , the ostensible leaders would turn consultants , with no more authority than other stakeholders . The council would convene regularly to discuss broad topics and redress problemsthat affected the entire colony . A yearly democratic meeting would vote on any issues that required the consent of all . Magistrate Cherry Duff administered justice at Landing and would have a circuit for grievances and any litigation . By the terms of the Pern Charter , charterers and contractors alike would be autonomous on their stake acres . The plan was idealistic , perhaps , but as Benden repeatedly insisted , there was more than enough land and resources to allow everyone plenty of latitude . There had been no more than a few grumbles so far about Joel Lilienkamp 's disposition of supplies and materiel from their stores . Everyone knew that once the imported supplies were exhausted , all would have to learn to make do with what they had , to replace with their own industry , or to barter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to improvise , and everyone took good care of irreplaceable tools and equipment . Between the weekly informal gatherings and the monthly mass meeting where most administrative matters were put to a democratic vote , the colony was running smoothly . An arbitration board had been voted on at one of the first mass meetings , comprising three ex/judges , two former governors , and four nonlegal people who would hold their offices for two years . The board would look into grievances and settle such disputes as might occur about staking acres or **28;15606;TOOLONG . The colony had four trained legists and two attorneys , but it was hoped that the need for such representations would be minimal . " There is no dispute so bitter that it can not be arbitrated by an impartial board or by a jury of peers , " Emily Boll had stated fervently and persuasively at one of the earliest mass meetings attended by everyone , including sleeping babies in their cradles . " Most of you know war firsthand . " She had paused dramatically . " Wars of attrition over land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pern is now far , far from those former battlefields . You are here because you wished to avoid the contagion of territorial imperatives that has plagued humans since time began . Where there is a whole planet , with diverse and magnificent lands and wealth and prospects , there is no longer a need to covet a neighbor 's possessions . Stake your own acres , build your homes , live in peace with the rest of us , and help us all build a world truly a paradise . " The power of her ringing voice and the sincerity of her fervent phrases had , on that glorious evening , motivated everyone to fulfill that dream . Also a realist , Emily Boll knew very well that there were dissident factors among those who had listened so politely before giving her a cheering ovation . Avril , Lemos , Nabol , Kimmer , and a handful of others had already been tagged as possible troublemakers . But Emily devoutly hoped that the dissidents would become so involved in their new lives on Pern that they would have little time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The charter and the contracts had incorporated the right to disciplinethe signatories for " acts against the common good . " Such acts had as yet to be defined . Emily and Paul had argued about the necessity for any sort of penal code . Paul Benden favored the " punishment fitting the crime " as an object lesson for miscreants and frequent breakers of the " peace and tranquility of the settlement . " He also preferred to mete out communitydiscipline on the spot , shaming offenders in public and requiring them to do some of the more disagreeable tasks necessary to the running of the colony . So far that rough justice had been sufficient . Meanwhile , the discreet surveillance continued on a number of folk , and Paul and Emily met with Ongola from time to time to discuss the general morale of the community and those problems that were best kept discreet . Paul and Emily also made sure to be constantlyp103accessible to all the colonists , hoping to solve small discontents before they could grow into serious problems . They kept official " office hours " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be religious in the archaic meaning of the word , but it makes good sense to give worker and beast one day 's rest , " Emily stated in the second of the mass meetings . " The old Judean Bible used by some of the old religious sects on Earth contained a great many commonsensible suggestions for an agricultural society , and some moral and ethical traditions which are worthy of retention "  --  she held up a hand , smiling benignly  --  " but without any hint of fanaticadherence ! We left that back on Earth along with war ! " While the two leaders knew that even that loose form of democratic government might be untenable once the settlers had spread out from Landing to their own acres , they did hope that the habits acquiredwould suffice . Early American pioneers on that western push had exhibited a keen sense of independence and mutual assistance . The later Australian and New Zealand communities had risen above tyrannical governors and isolation to build people of character , resource , and incredible adaptability . The first international Moonbase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resourcefulness . The original settlers on First had been largely the progeny of ingenious Moon and asteroid-belt miner parents , and the Pern colonyincluded many descendants of those original pioneering groups . Paul and Emily proposed to institute yearly congregations of as many people from the isolated settlements as possible to reaffirm the basic tenets of the colony , acknowledge progress , and apply the minds of many to address any general problems . Such a gathering would also be the occasion for trading and social festivities . Cabot Francis Carter , one of the legists , had proposed setting aside a certain area , midway on the continent , that would be the center for these annual assemblies . " That would be the best of all possible worlds , " Cabot had said in a mellifluous bass voice that had often stirred Supreme Courts on Earth and First . Emily had once told Paul that Cabot was the most unlikely of their charter members , but it was his legal guild that had produced the actual charter and rammed it through the bureaucracy to be ratified by the FSP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we can damn sure try ! " Alone with Emily and Ongola , Paul recalled that stirring challenge as he ticked off names on his long callused fingers . " Which is why I think we should continue to keep tabs on people like Bitra , lashkovich , Nabol , Lemos , Olubushtu , Kung , Usuai , and Kimmer.  |p104The  list is , mercifully , short , considering our numbers . I 'm not addingKenjo , because he 's shown absolutely no connection with any of the others . " " I still do n't like it . Secret surveillance smacks too much of the subterfuges used by other governments in more parlous times , " Emilysaid grimly . " It feels demeaning to myself and to my office to use such tactics . " " There 's nothing demeaning in knowing who 's agin you , " Paul argued . " An intelligence section has always proved invaluable . " " In revolutions , wars , power struggles , yes , but not here on Pern . " " Here as well as everywhere else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mankind , not to mention Nathi , and even the Eridanites to some degree , prove in many ways that greed is universal . I do n't see the bounty of Pern changing that trait . " " Forgo that futile old argument , my friends , " Ongola said with one of his wise , sad smiles . " The necessary steps have already been taken to defunction the gig . I have , as you recommended  --  " He inclined his head to Paul . "  --  stripped the gig of several minor but essential parts in the ignition system , the effect of which would be obvious early on , and substituted two dud chips in the guidance module , something that would not be so obvious . " He gestured out the window . " Sleds are allowed to park any which way , effectively but surreptitiouslyblocking the gig from taking off . But I do n't really know why she would . " Paul Benden winced , and the other two looked away from him , knowing that he had allowed himself to be too intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I 'd be more worried if Avril knew about that cache of Kenjo 's , " Paul said . " Telgar 's figures indicate that there 's half a tank 's worth for the Mariposa . " He grimaced . He had found it hard enough to believe that Kenjo Fusaiyuko had scrounged so much fuel . Paul had a grudging admiration for the sheer scope of the theft , even if he could not understand the motive , and especially for the risks that Kenjo had gotten away with during all those fuel-saving shuttle trips " Avril favors us so seldom with her company that I do n't worry that she 'd discover the hoard , " Emily said with a wry smile . " I 've also managed to have Lemos , Kimmer , and Nabol assigned to different sections , with few occasions to return here . Divide and conquer , ' the man said . " " Inappropriate , Emily , " Paul replied , grinning . " If , and I do stress that improbability , Avril should discover and use Kenjo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger lbp105each point , " manage to find the missing pieces , and fly the gig out of here undetected , she would have a half-full tank . She would not then drain the ships ' reserves to a danger point . Frankly , we would be well rid of her and whoever she deigns to take with her . I think we dwell too much on the matter . Those seismic reports from the eastern archipelago are far more worrying . Young Mountain is smoking again and twitching its feet . " " I agree , " Paul said , quite willing to turn to the more immediate problem . " Yes , but for what purpose did Kenjo take so much fuel ? " Emily asked . " You have n't answered that question . Why would he risk the safety of passengers and cargo ? And he is a genuinely eager colonist ! He 's already chosen his stake acreage . " " A pilot of Kenjo 's ability risked nothing , " Paul replied smoothly . " His shuttle flights were without incident . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admiral in mild surprise . " Has n't he done enough flying for one lifetime ? " Paul smiled with understanding . " Not Kenjo . What I do completely appreciate is that flying a mere power sled is a come-down , a loss of prestige , face , considering the kind of craft he 's flown and where he 's been . You say that he 's chosen his acres , Emily ? Where ? " " Down beyond what people are beginning to call the Sea of Azov , as far away from Landing as he can get but on rather a pleasant plateau , to judge by the probe report , " Emily replied . She hoped that the meeting would conclude soon . Pierre had promised her a special meal , and she found that she was enjoying those quiet dinners far more than she had thought she would . " Howinell is Kenjo going to get those tons of fuel there ? " Benden asked . " I suspect we 'll have to wait and see , " Ongola replied with the trace of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same right as everyone else to use power sleds to transport his goods , and he 's done some close trading with work units at the commissary . Shall I have a word with Joel about Kenjo 's requisitions ? " Emily glanced quickly at Paul , who was adamant in his defense of Kenjo . " Well , I do n't like unsolved riddles . I 'd prefer some sort of explanation , and I think you would , too , Paul . " When Benden noddedreluctantly , Emily said that she would speak to Joel Lilienkamp . " Which brings us back to that third tremor , " Paul Benden said . " How 's work progressing on buttressing the stores warehouses andp106the one with all the medical supplies ? We ca n't afford to lose such irreplaceable items . " Ongola consulted his notes . He wrote with a bold angular script that looked , from Emily 's angle , like ancient manuscript ornamentations . All three of them , as well as most section heads , had made a point of reverting to less sophisticated methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rechargeability was good but not infinite , were to be reserved for essential uses , so everyone was rediscovering the art of calligraphy . " The work will be completed by next week . The seismic net has been extended as far as the active volcano in the eastern archipelago and to Drake 's Lake . " Paul grimaced . " Are we going to let him get away with that ? " " Why not ? " Emily asked , grinning . " No one 's contesting it . Drake was the first to see it . A community settling there would have ample space to grow , and plenty of industry to support it . " " Is it scheduled for a vote ? " Paul asked after an appreciative sip of his brandy . " No , " Ongola said with another hint of a grin . " Drake is still campaigning . He does n't want any opposition , and whatever there might have been is now worn down . " Paul snorted , and Emily cast her eyes upward in amused exasperationwith the flamboyant pilot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass . As Emily went on to the next point on their informal agenda , he took another sip , rolling the liquor around in his mouth , savoring the soon-to-be-exhausted beverage . He could and did drink the quikal but found it harsh to a palate trained to subtleties . " We are proceeding well in general terms , " Emily was saying briskly . " You heard that one of the dolphins died , but Olga 's death was accepted by her community with considerable equanimity . Accordingto Ann Gabri and Efram , they had expected more fatalities . Olga was , apparently , " she added with a grin , " older than she said she was and had n't wished to let her last calf go into the unknown without her . " All three chuckled and followed Paul 's lead as he raised a toast to maternal love . " Even our . . . nomads . spread out . " She tapped it with her pencil , still unused to handwriting notes but struggling to get accustomed to archaic memory assists . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main computerp107banks on the Yokohama , but it was rarely used anymore . " The nomads'vemade rather a lot of inroads on clothing fabrics , but when those are depleted , that 's the end of it and they 'll have to make their own or trade , the same as the rest of us . We have located all the campsites . Even on foot , the Tuareg contingent can travel astonishingdistances , but they camp for a while , in two separate sections . " " Well , they 've a whole planet to lose themselves in , " Paul said expansively . " Have they posed any other problems , Ongola ? " The dark man shook his heavy head , lowering the lids of his deepseteyes . He was agreeably surprised by the nomads ' smooth transitionto life on Pern . Every week each tribe sent a representative to the veterinary sheds . The forty-two mares brought in coldsleep by the colony were all in foal , and the nomads ' leaders had accepted the fact that a mare 's gestation period was eleven months on Pern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the vets keep their sense of humor . But Red Hanrahan seems to understand their ways and deals with them . " " Hanrahan ? Did n't his daughter find the dragonets ? " " She and a boy , one of the travelers , " Ongola replied . " They also provided the corpses which the bios have been clucking over . " " Could be useful creatures , " Benden said . " They already are , " Emily added stoutly . Ongola smiled . One day , Ongola thought , he would find a nest at the critical hatching point and he would have one of those charming , friendly , nearly intelligent creatures as a pet . He had once learned Dolphin , but he had never been able to overcome his fear of being constricted underwater to share their world properly . He needed space about him . Once , when Paul was sharing one of the long watches with him on the journey to Pern , the admiral had argued most eloquently that the dangers of outer space were even more inimical to human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airless , " Paul had said , " although it contains oxygen , but when and if the Pure Lives ' hold on human adaptations is broken , humans will be able to swim without artificial help . Space has no oxygen at all . " " But you are weightless in space . Water presses down on you . You feel it . " ' " You 'd better not feel space , " Paul had replied with a laugh , but he had not argued the point further . " Now , to more pleasant matters , " Paul said . " How many contract marriages are to be registered tomorrow , Emily ? " Emily smiled , riffling pages of her notepad to come to the nextp108seventh-day sheet , since that had become the usual time for such celebrations . In order to widen the gene pool in the next generation , the charter permitted unions of varying lengths , first insuring the support of a gravid woman and the early years of the resultant child . Prospective partners could choose which conditions suited their requirements , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake acres , for failing to fulfill whatever contract had been agreed and signed before the requisite number of witnesses . " Three ! " " The numbers are falling off , " Paul remarked . " I 've done my bit , " Ongola said , slyly glancing at the two staunchly single leaders . Ongola had courted Sabra Stein so adroitly that neither of his close friends had realized he had become attached until the couple 's names had appeared on the marital schedule six weeks earlier . In fact , Sabra was already pregnant , which had led Paul to remark that the big gun was not firing blanks . He had let his bawdy humor disguise his relief . for he knew that Ongola still grieved for the wife and family of his youth . Ongola 's hatred of the Nathi and his implacable desire for revenge had sustained the man throughout the war . For a long while , Paul had worried that his favorite aide and valued commander might be unable to alter that overpowering hatred even in a more peaceful clime . " Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowing grin lighting a somber face that even his present felicitous state did not completely brighten . Emily was astonished . She had thought that she and Pierre had been discreet . But she had recently noticed in herself a tendency to smile more easily and to lose the thread of conversations for no apparent reason . She and Pierre were an unlikely combination of personalities , but that was half the pleasure of it . Their relationship had begun quite unexpectedly about the fifth week after Landing , when Pierre had asked her opinion of a casserole composed entirely of indigenous ingredients . He administered the mass catering of Landing , and very well , she thought , considering the wide range of tastes and dietary requirements . He had started to serve her special dishes when she ate at the big mess hall . Then , when she would often have to work through the lunch hour , Pierre de Courci would bring over the tray she ordered . " IfI were the possessive type , I would keep his cooking to myself , " she replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad/vantage you men have over me . How about it , Paul ? Will you do your hit ? " Emily knew that her tone had a snap to it , born of envy . None of her children , all adults , had wished to accompany her on a one-way tourney . Unperturbed , Paul Benden merely smiled enigmatically and sipped at his brandy . " Caves ! " Sallah cried , nudging Tarvi 's arm and pointing to the rock barrier in front of them . Sunlight outlined openings in its sheer face . He reacted instantly and enthusiastically , with the kind of almost innocent joy of discovery that Sallah found so appealing in him . The continually unfolding beauties of Pern had not palled on Tarvi Andiyar . Each new wonder was greeted with as much interest as the last one he had extolled for its magnificence , its wealth , or its potential . She had wangled ruthlessly to get herself assigned as his expeditionpilot . They were making their third trip together  --  and their first solo excursion . Sallah was playing it cautiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity to project her femininity would not force him to retreat into his usual utterly courteous , utterly impersonal shell . She had seen other women who made a determined play for the handsome , charming geologist rehuffedby his demeanor ; they were surprised , puzzled , and sometimes hurt by the way he eluded their ploys . For a while , Sallah wondered if l'arvi liked women at all , but he had shown no preference for the acknowledged male lovers in Landing . He treated everyone , man , woman , and child , with the same charming affability and understanding . And whatever his sexual preference , he was nonetheless expected to add to the next generation . Sallah was already determined to be the medium and would find the moment . Perhaps she had found it . Tarvi had a special fondness for caves ; he had at various times called them orifices of the Mother Earth , entrancesto the mysteries of her creation and construction , and windowsinto her magic and bounty . Even though this was Pern , he worshipped the same mystery that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an aerial reconnaissance of the location of several mineral deposits noted by the metallurgy probes . Iron , vanadium , manganese , and even germanium were to be found to the mountainous spine that Sallah was aiming at as they followed the course of a river to its source . She was also operating under the general directive that unusual sites should be recorded and photo/graphed to offer the widest possible choice . Only a third of those with stake acreage had made their selection . There was a subtle pressure to keep everyone in the southern continent  --  at least in the first few generations  --  but there was no such directive in the charter . The broad , long river valley that lay to their right as they approached the precipice was , to Sallah 's mind , the most beautiful they had seen so far . Rene Mallibeau , the colony 's most determined vintner , was still looking for the proper type of slope and soil for his vineyards , though to get his project started he had actually released some of his hoard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viniculture . Quikal was not a universally accepted substitute for the traditional spirits . Despite being poured through a variety of filters with of without additives , nothing could completely reduce the raw aftertaste . Rene had been promised the use of ceramic-lined metal fuel tanks which , once thoroughly cleansed , would provide him with wine vats of superior quality . Of course , once the proper oak forests had reached adequate size for use as staves , his descendants could move back to the traditional wooden barrel . " Rather spectacular , that precipice , is n't it , Tarvi ? " Sallah said , grinning rather foolishly , as if the view were a surprise that she herself had prepared for him . " Indeed it is . In Xanadu did Kublai Khan , ' " he murmured in his rich deep voice . " Caverns measureless to man ' ? " Sallah capped it , careful not tosound smug that she recognized his source . Tarvi often quoted obscureSanskrit and Pushtu texts , leaving her groping for a suitable retort . " Precisely , 0 moon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarvi 's phrases were am biguous , and she knew that he did not mean what his phrase sug gested . He would not be so obvious . Or would he ? Had she pent. traced that bland exterior after all ? She forced herself to contemplai c the immense stone bulwark . Its natural fluted columns appeared carved by an inexperienced or inattentive sculptor , yet the imperfeetion contributed to the overall beauty of the precipice . " This valley is six or seven klicks long , " she said quietly , awed h the truly impressive natural site . From the steep , right-angled fall of a spectacular diedre , the palisad ( led in a somewhat straight line for about three klicks before falling back into a less perfectly defined face that sloped down in the distance to meet the floor of the valley . She angled the sled to starboardp111facing upriver , and they were nearly blinded by the brilliant sunlight reflecting from the surface of the lake that had been charted by the probe . " No , land here , " Tarvi said quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not much given to personal contact , and Sallah tried not to misinterpret excitement for anything else . " I must see the caves . " He released the safety harness and swiveled his seat around . Then he walked to the back of the sled , rummaging among the supplies . " Lights , we 'll need lights , ropes , food , water , recording devices , specimen kit , " he muttered as his deft movements filled two backpacks . " Boots ? Have you on proper boots . . . ah , those will do , indeed they will . Sallah , you are always well prepared . " He compoundedhis inadvertent injury to her feelings by one of his more ingratiating smiles . Once again , Sallah shook her head over her whimsical fancy , which had managed to settle on one of the most elusive males of her acquaintance . Of course , she consoled herself , anything easily had is rarely worth having . She landed the sled at the base of the towering precipice , as near to the long narrow mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grappling hook  --  that first slab looks about five meters above the scree . Here you are , Sallah ! " He handed her pack over , waiting only long enough to see her grab a strap before he released the canopy , jumped down , and was striding toward the towering buttress . With a resigned shrug , Sallah flipped on beacon , comm unit , and recorder for incoming messages , fastenedher jacket , settled the rather hefty pack on her back , and followed him , closing the canopy behind her . He scrambled up the scree and stood with one palm flat against the slab , looking up its imposing and awesome spread , his face rapt with wonder . Gently , as in a caress , he stroked the stone before he began to look right and left , assessing how best to climb to the cave . He flashed her an ingenuous smile , acknowledging her presence and assuming her willingness . " Straight up . Not much of a climb with pitons . " The climb proved strenuous . Sallah could have used a breather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave opening , and nothing was going to deter Tarvi from immediate entrance and a leisurely inspection . Ah , well , it was just 1300 hours . They had time in hand . She rolled to her feet , unlatching the handlight from her belt just a few seconds after he had done the same , and was at his side as he peered into the opening.  | " Lords , gods , and minor deities ! " His invocation was a mere whisper , solemn and awed , a susurrous echo . The vast initial cavern was larger than the cargo hold of the Yokohama . Sallah made that instant comparison , remembering how eerie that immense barren space had seemed on her last trip , and in the next second , she wondered what the cavern would look like occupied . It would make a spectacular great hall , in the tradition of medieval times on Earth  --  only even more magnificent . Tarvi held his breath , hesitantly extending his still-dark handlight , as if reluctant to illuminate the majesty of the cavern . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeling himself to commit sacrilege , and then the light came on . Wings whirred as shadows made silent sinuous departures to the darker recesses . They both ducked as the winged denizens departed in flight lines just clearing their heads , though the cave entrance was at least four meters high . Ignoring the exodus , Tarvi moved reverentlyinto the vast space . " Amazing , " he murmured as he shined the light up and judged that the shell of the outer wall above them was barely two meters thick . " A very thin face . " " Some bubble , " Sallah said , feeling impious and wanting to regain her equilibrium after her initial awe . " Look , you could carve a staircasein that , " she said , her light picking out a slanting foot of rock that rose to a ledge where a large darkness indicated yet another cave . She spoke to inattentive ears , for Tarvi was already prowling about , determining the width of the entrance and the dimensions of the cave . She hurried after him . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its widest , tapering at either end to forty-six meters on the left and forty-two meters on the right . Along the back wall , there were innumerable irregular openings at random levels ; some were on the ground level leading into apparent tunnel complexes , most of which were high enough to admit Tarvi 's tall frame with considerable head space ; others , like great dead eyes , peered down from higher up the inside wall . Entranced as Tarvi was by their discovery , he was a trained scientific observer . With Sallah 's aid , he began to draft an accurate plan of the main chamber , the openings of secondary ones , and the tunnel complexes leading inward . He penetratedeach to a depth of a hundred meters , roped to a nervous Sallah who kept glancing back at the cave 's opening for the reassuring sight of the waning day . His rough notes were refined by the light of the gas fire on whichp113Sallah cooked their evening meal . Tarvi had elected to camp far enough into the cave to be protected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far enough to the left so as not to interfere with the habits of the cave 's natural residents . Later , a low flame from the protected gas fire would discourage most of Pern 's wildlife from investigating the intruders . Somehow , in the cave Sallah did feel like an intruder , though she had not previously been bothered by that notion . The place was truly awe-inspiring . Tarvi had gone down to the sled to bring up more drafting tools and the folding table over which he had hunched almost immediately . With no comment , he had eaten the stew she had carefully prepared , absently handing back his plate for a second helping . Sallah was of two minds about Tarvi 's concentration . On the one hand , she was a good cook and liked to have her skill acknowledged . On the other hand , she was as glad that Tarvi was distracted . One of the pharmacists had given her a pinch of what she swore was a potent indigenous aphrodisiac ; Sallah had used it to season Tarvi 's share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and body vibrating to his presence and their solitude . But she was beginning to wonder if the aphrodisiac was strong enough to overcome Tarvi 's enchantment with the cave . Just her luck to get him to herself for a night or two and then have him be totally enthralled by Dear Old Mother Earth in Pernese costume . But she had not bided her time to waste a sterling opportunity . She could wait . All night . And tomorrow . She had enough of the joy dust to use the next night , too . Maybe it just took a while to act . " It is truly magnificent in its proportions , Sallah . Here , look ! " He straightened his torso , arching his back against his cramped muscles , and Sallah came up behind him , knelt , and considerately began to knead his taut shoulder muscles as she peered over his shoulder . The two-dimensional sketch had been deftly drawn with bold lines : he had added back , front , and side elevations , truthfully ending them where his measurements ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious . " What a fort it would have been in the olden days ! " He looked toward the black interior , his wide liquid eyes shining , his face alight as imagination altered the chamber before him . " Why , it would have housed whole tribes . Kept them secure for years from invasion . There 's fresh water , you understand , down the third left-hand tunnel . Of course , the valley itself would be defensible and this the protectedp114inner hold , with that daunting slab to defeat climbers . There are no less than eighteen different exits from the main chamber . " She had worked her hands up the column of his neck , then across the trapezius muscles , and down to the deltoids , massaging firmly but letting her fingers linger in a movement that she had found immenselyeffective on other occasions when she had wished to relax a man . " Ah , how kind you are , Sallah , to know where the muscles bind . " He twisted slightly , not to evade her seeking , kneading fingers but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low table to one side so that his arms could fall naturally to his lap as he rotated his head . " There 's a point , eleventh vertebrae . . . " he suggested , and she dutifully found the knot of muscle and smoothed it expertly . He sighed like a lithe dark feline being stroked . She said nothing , but moved ever so slightly forward so that her body touched his . As she walked her fingers back to his neck , she dared to press against him so that her breasts lightly touched his shoulder blades . She could feel her nipples harden at the contact , and her respiration quickened . Her fingers ceased to knead and began to caress , moving down over his chest in long slow motions . He caught her hands then , and she could feel the stillness of him , a stillness of mind and breath , as his body began to tremble slightly . " Perhaps this is the time , " he mused as if alone . " There will never be a better . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as much a trademark of Tarvi Andiyar as his ineffable charm , he gathered her in his arms , pulling her across his lap . His expression , oddly detached as if examining her for the first time , was not yet quite the tender , loving expression she had sowished to evoke . His expressive and large brown eyes were almost sad , though his perfectly shaped lips curved in an infinitely gentle smile  --  as if , the thought intruded on Sallah 's delight in her progress , he did not wish to frighten her . " So , Sallah , " he said in his rich low and sensual voice , " it is you . " She knew she should interpret that cryptic remark , but then bebegan to kiss her , his hands suddenly displaying an exceedingly eroticmind of their own , and she no longer wished to interpret anything.  |p115Four  mares , three dolphins , and twelve cows produced their young at precisely the same moment , or so the records for that dawn hour stood . Sean had even agreed to allow Sorka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Pol and Bay . He had maintained a pose of skepticism over the color and sex of the creature although , three days previously , he had already witnessed that the first of the draft animals produced for his father 's group was exactly as requested , a sturdy bay mare with white socks and a face blaze who had weighed over seventy kilos at birth and would be the image of the long-dead Shire stallion whose sperm had begot her . Some wit had quipped that Landing 's records were turning into the biblical begottens of Pern 's chronicle . In two years , the new generationwas well begun and increasing daily . Human births were less minutely reported than the successes of animalkind , but at least as well celebrated . Sheep and the Nubian strain of goats that had somehow adapted where other tough breeds had failed grazed Landing 's meadows and would soon go to farm-stake acres in the temperate belts of the southern continent . The growing herds and flocks were patrolled by such a proliferation of dragonets that the ecologists were becoming concerned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The tame dragonets were proving to be extraordinarilyfaithful to the humans who had impressed them at hatching , even after their voracious appetites abated with maturity and they were well able to forage on their own . The biology department was learning more about the little creaturesevery day . Bay Harkenon and Pol Nietro had discovered a particularly surprising phenomenon . When Bay 's little queen mated with a bronze that Pol had impressed , the sensuality of their pets surprised them with its intensity . They found themselves responding to the exciting stimulus in a human fashion . After the initial shock , they came to a mutual conclusion and took a larger residence together . Awed by the empathic potential of the dragonets , Bay and Pol asked for , and got , Kitti Ping 's permission to try mentasynth enhance/ment on the fourteen eggs that Bay 's Mariah had conceived in her mating flight . They fussed considerably more over the little golden Mariah than was necessary , but neither the dragonet nor her clutch suffered . When Mariah produced her enhanced eggs in a specially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smugly pleased . Incorporation of mentasynth , which had originally been developed by the Beltrae , a reclusive Eridani hive culture , sparked latent empathicabilities . Dragonets had already demonstrated such an ability , amounting to an almost telepathic communication with a few people . The dragonets were clearly a remarkable evolutionary attempt which , like dolphins , had produced an animal that understood its environment  --  andcontrolled it . So , inspired by the success of the dolphins ' mentasynth enhancement , Bay and Pol hoped that the dragonetswould come to an even closer empathy with people . Initially , humans from Beltrae who had been " touched " were regardedwith great suspicion , of course , but as soon as their remarkableempathic powers with animals and other people were realized , the technique became widespread . Many groups eventually had valuedhealers whose abilities had been amplified that way . Luckily , that all happened well before the Pure Human group became powerful . From their studies of the tunnel snakes and wherries , Bay and Pol had come to an appreciation of the potential of the charming and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with several generations of the little tunnel snakes , to incorporate the mentasynth system successfully , but longtime experience with such species as dolphins  --  and , of course , man  --  paid off . Everyone in Landing had come to have a working knowledge of the habits of the dragonets , biological as well as psychological , for thereI 'll was good cause to be grateful to the creatures and to tolerate their few natural excesses . Theoretically , Bay had known that some of the owners seemed to feel the " primitive urges " of the creatures : hunger , fear , anger , and an intense mating imperative . She had simply never thought that she would be as vulnerable as her younger colleagues . It had been an exceedingly delightful surprise . Red and Mairi Hanrahan were thankful that Sorka and Sean hadimpressed  --  the word , meaning the act of imprinting a dragonet , had somehow crept into the language  --  dragonets that would not want to mate with each other . They still did not approve of Sorka 's close attachment to the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to irresistible sensual urges . On that morning , nearly twelve months after Landing , the mare Sean had chosen to produce his promised foal was laboring to givep117birth , there was no doubt that Sorka , who had turned thirteen , and Sean , two years older , were in rapport with their eagerly anticipating dragonets . The two browns and the bronze had perched on the top rail of the stable partition , their eyes whirling with growing excitementas they crooned their birth song . The little chestnut mare dropped to the straw to deliver the forelegs and head of her foal . Above , the rafters of the barn seemed to ripple with its temporary adornment of the dragonet population of Landing , crooning and chirping continual encouragement . Dragonets were sentimental about births and missed none in Landing , bugling in high-pitched tenor voices at each new arrival . Fortunately , they discreetly remained outside human habitations . The colony 's obstetricians had lately been working nonstop and had drafted the nurses and taken on apprentices . An array of dragonets on a roof became an irrefutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The obstetricians could gauge the labor 's progress by the growing intensity of the dragonets ' welcoming song . The chorus might deprive neighbors of sleep , but most of the communitytook it in good humor . Even the most jaundiced had seen the dragonets protecting the flocks and herds , and had to appreciate their value . The chestnut mare heaved again , extruding the foal farther . Since its legs , head , and forequarters were wet with birth fluids , Sean could not distinguish the animal 's color . Then the rest of the body emerged , followed , with a final push , by the hindquarters . There was no doubt that he was not only darkly dappled but male . With a crow of incredulous joy , Sean dropped to the little fellow 's head to mop it dry , even before the mare could form her bond . Tears streaming down her dusty face , Sorka hugged herself in joy . Dimly she heard the excited comments of the other animal midwives sharing the large barn . " He 's the only colt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As ordered . " Though the colony actually needed as many female animals as it could breed , Sean 's preference for a colt had been duly considered . And one local stallion would be a safeguard , though there were more than enough varied sperms in reserve . " Grand fellow , though , " Red remarked , nodding his head approvingly . " Make a good sixteen hands , if I 'm any judge . A sturdy nine stone , I 'd say . Fine good fellow , and she bore him like a trooper . " He stroked the neck of the little mare , who was licking the colt as he suckled her with vigor . " Come now , Sorka , " he went on , seeing her tear-streaked face.  | " I 'll keep my promise that you 'll have a horse , too . " He gave her a reassuring hug . " I know you will , Da , " she said , burrowing into his chest . " I 'm crying because I 'm so happy for Sean . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " Red Hanrahan laughed softly , for it would n't do for Sean to hear . Not that the boy was aware of anything but the colt , twisting its stump of a tail as if that would speed its suckling . For once , Sean 's customary wary , often cynical expression had softened with amazed tenderness as he devoured the colt with his eyes . After Sorka gave her father a hug for his assurances , she stepped away from him , and her bronze glided down to her shoulder , chatteringin a happy social tone as he wrapped his tail possessively about her neck . Then Duke leaned down Sorka 's chest , his eyes sparkling blue and green as he , too , examined the new arrival closely . Encouraged , Sean 's brown pair dropped to the lower rail of the foaling box , exchanging cheeps and chirps with Duke . " You approve ? " Sean asked them , grinning despite the challenge in his tone . Bobbing their heads up and down vigorously , they extended wings , each complaining that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicked their wings to their backs and assured Sean volubly that they approved . He grinned back at them . " He 's a real beauty , Sean . Just what you wanted , " Sorka said . Unaccountably Sean shook his head , looking dubious . " Too young to tell if he 'll match Cricket . " " Oh , you are the utter limit ! " Sorka snapped angrily . She left the box , nearly jamming the door rail as she closed it with considerable vehemence . " What 'd I say ? " Sean demanded of Red Hanrahan . " I think you 'll have to figure that one out yourself , boyo ! " Red clapped him on the shoulder , torn between amusement and a certain concern for his daughter . " Give the mare her feed before you leave , will you , Sean ? " As Red Hanrahan walked down the aisle , checking on the other new arrivals , he considered Sorka 's behavior . She was thirteen but a well-developed girl who had been menstruating for nearly a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sean . He toleratedher . As did Sean 's family . Mairi and Red had talked it over , wary of the boy 's background though both Hanrahans acknowledged that it was time to discard old attitudes and opinions . Sean , too , had made several notable concessions . Whether spurredp119by competition with Sorka or mere male arrogance , he had improved his reading and writing skills and frequently used a viewer to scan veterinary texts in Red 's office . Red had carefully cultivated the boy 's interest and encouraged him to help with the breeding stock . The boy unquestionably had a way with animals , not just horses , though he ignored sheep altogether . " Sean says sheep are for stealing , trading , and eating , " Sorka told her father when he had remarked on that exception . Maki did worry occasionally that Sorka was inevitably partnered with Sean when they were assigned together to the zoological expeditions . But , as Sorka blithely explained , she got along with Sean , and they were both more used to handling animals and wildlife than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligatory share of work for the colony , and enjoyed it , they were ahead of the game . Sean was also making more of a contribution to Landing 's efforts than most of his people . It was just that Sean and Sorka were becominglinked together in the collective Landing mind , Maki wistfully remarked one evening to Red . To his surprise , Red found himself in the position of devil 's advocate . But then , like Sorka , he had grown accustomed to Sean 's ways and knew what to ignore . Sorka 's exhibition of female exasperation that morning was the first of its kind , to Red 's knowledge , and he wondered ruefully if her patience with Sean 's obtuseness was exhausted , or if their relationshipwas merely entering a new phase . Sorka had been given an appropriate theoretical education in sexual relationships but until today had shown only a patient acceptance of Sean 's behavior and eccentricities . He would have to talk with Maki . When he got the chance . " Red ! Reeeeddd ! " another veterinarian called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until much later that night that he remembered the problem of Sorka and Sean , but Maki was already long asleep and , as well as being in the second trimester of a pregnancy , she was working hard enough in the creche to deserve her rest . The westward jutting finger of the northern continent pointed directlyat the big island , which loomed lavender above the gray of the morning sea . Avril had lifted off from the desert camp well before dawn , leaving a message that she was taking a day off . The others would not mind , and she was as tired of Ozzie Munson and Cobber Alhinwa as they were of her . Yesterday , the two miners had found some really good turquoise and refused to tell her where , tantalizing her with brief glimpses ofp120the very fine sky-blue-banded rock . She had known when they came into camp the previous evening that they were excited about the hunk that they were tossing back and forth . She had merely asked to see it , and had allowed herself to become irritated when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very cautious with those two , she thought . They thought themselves so clever . Anyhow , turquoise , though valued for its rarity on Earth , was not really worth the trouble of ingratiating herself to those two jerks . Then , at supper , when they were still whispering between themselves and glancing at her with sly smiles , she began to wonder if they had heard something in particular to make them react as they had to her polite and diffident query . She tried to remember if they had ever teamed up with Bart Lemos . But he was at Andiyar 's ore mountain . He must , for once , have kept quiet about the gold nuggets that he had been panning out of a mountain stream above the camp . Obedient to the pact they had made on the Yoko , he had given them to her to hide in her cache at Landing . She had not confided much of her scheme to him , for , given a few mugs of quikal , Bart Lemos would give anyone his life history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally as she had initially thought , hearing his sly and witty complaints during the last year of that interminable journey to this godforsaken planet . He was more attractive than the others ; in fact , he was extremely attractive and , more importantly , lusty , with a willingness to experiment that the much vaunted Admiral Benden had never displayed . A bit of a bore in bed , our dear admiral . Damn Paul Benden . Why had he turned so cool toward her ? After all those protestations of admiration and devotion . She had been so certain that she had felt the marriage contract in her hand . Then , a scant year away from their destination , when Rukbat had grown from a spark to a gleam in the blackness of space , Benden had altered . He suddenly had had no time for her at all . Well , he would find out what Avril Bitra was made of . And then it would be too late . Colonizing had seemed like a good idea back on Earth when the excitement of the Nathi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centauri , which everyone knew was controlled by the First Familiesand founding companies , was no better than Earth or moldering at grade on a lumbering merchantman . She had even toyed with the challenge of navigating mining ships within the Belts until the RooseveltDome had exploded for no apparent reason , killing all but it handful of the ten thousand inhabitants . The chance to rule a ne ' world had drawn her . Over the years , she had had enough experiencep121with psycho profiles to know how to control her pulse and what answers to give to the asinine questions that were supposed to separatetruth from fiction . And so she had been accepted as astrogator for the Pern expedition . But since she had failed to capture Paul Benden , who would be Peru 's first leader  --  in her estimation , the less colorful Emily Boll would be overshadowed by the more flamboyant admiral once they landed on Pern  --  she had decided that living the rest of her life in obscurity at the end of the Milky Way was insupportable . She was , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts , and a deepsleeptank , she could make her way to some other civilized and sophisticatedplanet that catered to the life-style she wished to enjoy . She had begun with Stev Kimmer , partly just to ease the pain of losing Paul Benden . When she had noticed that Bart Lemos managed to attach himself to her whenever Stev was on duty , she encouraged him , too . Nabhi Nabol joined the group one evening , along with several others . Bart and Nabhi were pilots , each with a useful secondaryskill : Bart in mining , and Nabhi in computers . Stev was a mechanicalengineer with an uncanny ability to diagnose computer failures and rearrange chips to do twice the work they had been designed to handle . For the plan taking shape in her mind , she assembled useful cronies . Most were contractors like herself , or small-stake charterers beginning to feel that they had been shortchanged on their deals . In the back of Avril 's mind was the notion that it would be fun to see if she could foment sufficient discord to overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of as Paul Benden 's consort . But that would have to wait for a propitious moment once the colony had been settled in and troubles began . So far , except for minor hitches , there had been no trouble of the type that she could use for her purposes . Everyone was too busy scurrying around , settling in , raising livestock , and zipping here and there looking at real estate . She despised the colonists for being so enthusiastic about the ghastly empty wasteland of a world , with its noisy wildlife and the thousands of things that crawled , wriggled , or flew . There was not a decent useful animal native to the entire planet , and she was getting very tired of eating fish or wherry , which sometimestasted more like fish than what came out of the sea . Even tankbeefwould have been an acceptable substitute . More and more her determination to leave this wretched backwater world was reinforced . But she would leave it in style , and the hell with the rest of them.  |p122Stev  Kimmer was essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from parts he had " found " on the Yokohama ; without that essential piece of equipment , her scheme would have to be aborted . Kimmer had to be kept on the mark , too , for when she wanted to appropriate the captain 's gig . More important was his willingness to participate in her plan to stake the right sections of the island to prospect for the gemstones that she knew were there . Grandmama Shavva had left her single remaining descendant a legacy that had to be grasped . Kimmer was to requisition a sled for seven days in a quite legitimatesearch for a stake . He was supposed to imply that he was looking about the southern continent . As a veteran of the Nathi War , he had twice Avril 's allotment . That the charterers had more than any contractor , including herself , the astrogator , who had delivered them safely to the wretched place , was a fact that had never set well with her . Damn Munson and Alhinwa . They could have told her where they had unearthed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mineral aplenty , untouched as yet by careless prospectors and greedy merchants . There was plenty for everyone . Back on sophisticated worlds , any large , well-colored hunks of that sky-blue stone would be snatched up by ardent collectors  --  the higher the asking price the more collectible ! And why had she not heard from Nabhi ? She suspected that he might be trying to run a program of his own , instead of the one she had set . She would have to watch that one : he was a devious sort . Much as she was . In the long run , she had the upper hand , since she was the astrogator , and Nabhi did not have the skills required to get home by himself . He had to have her , but she did not have to have him  --  unless it suited her . Nabol was not as good overall for her purposes as Kimmer was , but he would do in a pinch . She had almost bridged the distance between continent and island and could see waves lashing the granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of the natural harbor where the long-dead survey team had made camp . She had told Kimmer to meet her there . She felt better about being someplace that had already been occupied . She could not stand listening to the idiot colonists going on and on about being " first " to see that or " first " to step there , or the naming arguments that continually dominated conversation night after night around the bonfire . Shit in Drake 's Lake ! Fatuous ass ! Lousy gravity-ball player ! She corrected her course as she spotted the two natural spurs ofp123rock that formed a breakwater to the roughly oval natural harbor . Kimmer would have hid the sled anyhow just in case . . . She caught herself and snorted in sour amusement . As if anyone on this goodygoodworld is checking up on anyone else ! " We are all equal here . " Our brave and noble leaders have so ordained it . With equal rights to share in Pern 's wealth . You just bet . Only I 'll get my equal share before anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Just as she passed over the breakwater , she saw the glint of metal under the lush foliage to starboard on a ledge above the sandy shoreline . Nearby was the smoke of Kimmer 's small fire . She landed her sled neatly beside his . " You were right about this place , baby , " he greeted her , a closed fist upraised and shaken in victory . " I got here yesterday afternoon , good tail wind all the way , so I did a decco . And see what I found first thing ! " " Let me see , " she said , displaying a bright breathless eagerness , though she did not at all like his presumptive solo explorations. b He smiled broadly as he slowly opened his fingers and let his hand drop so that she could see the large gray rock he held . Her eagerness drained with discouragement until he turned the stone just slightly and she caught the unmistakable glint of green , half buried in one end . " Fardles ! " She snatched the stone from his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean by then . She wet her finger and rubbed at the green glint . " I also found this , " Kimmer said . Looking up , she saw him holding a squarish green stone the size of a spoon bowl , rough-edged where it had been prized from a limestonecavity . She almost threw away the rock with its still-hidden treasure in her eagerness to take the rough emerald from him . She held it to the sun , saw the flaw , but had no complaint about the clear deep green . She weighed it in her hand . Why , it had to be thirty or forty carats . With a clever lapidary to cut beyond the flaw , there would be fifteen carats of gemstone . And if that stone was just a sample . . . The idea of apprenticing as a gemstone cutter and using that magnificent jewel to learn on amused her . " Where ? " she demanded , her breath constricted with urgency . " Over there . " He half turned , pointing up into the thick vegetation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock . " " You just walked in and it winked at you ? " She forced herself tospeak lightly , amusedly , smiling up approvingly at his beaming face.  |p124He  looked so bloody pleased with himself . She continued to smile but ground her teeth . " I 've klah for you , " he said , gesturing to the fire where he had rigged a spit and a protecting rock for his kettle . " That abominable stuff , " she exclaimed . She had a fleet-incurred preference for strong coffee , and the last had been served at that pathetic Thanksgiving shindig  --  and spilled when the tremor had shaken the urns from their stands . The last coffee from Earth had seeped , undrunk , into the dirt of Pern . " Oh , if you use enough sweetening , it 's not all that bad . " He poured her a cup even though she had not said that she wanted one . " They say it 's got as much caffeine in it as coffee or tea . The secret 's in drying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lashed sweetener into the cup and handed it to her , expecting her to be grateful for his thoughtfulness . She could not afford to alienate Kimmer even if he sounded revoltingly like a good little colonist , approving of good colonial substitutes . " Sorry , Stev , " she said , smiling apologetically at him as she took the cup . " Early morning nerves . I really do miss coffee . " He gave a shrug . " We wo n't for long , now , will we ? " She kept her smile in place , wondering if he knew how inane he sounded . Then , she cautioned herself severely , if she had only been more careful with Paul , she might have been first lady on Pern . What had she done wrong ? She could have sworn she would be able to maintain his interest in her . All had gone perfectly right up until they entered the Rukbat system . Then it had been as if she no longer existed . And I got them here ! " Avril ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimmer 's voice . " Sorry ! " she said . " I said that I 've already got food for the day , so as soon as you finish that we can go . " She tipped her cup , watching the dark liquid momentarily stain the white sand . She jiggled the cup to scatter the last drops , put it upside down by the fire like a good little colonist , and rose to her feet , smiling brightly at Kimmer . " Well , let 's go ! "  |p127Perha|ps  it was because people were so accustomed to dragonets after nearly eight years of close association that they no longer paid much attention to the creatures ' behavior . Those who noticed their unusual antics thought that the dragonets were merely playing some sort of a new game , for they were inventively amusing . Later people would remember that the dragonets attempted to herd the flocks and herds back to the barns . Later marine rangers would remember that the bottlenoses Bessie , Lottie , and Maximilian had urgently tried to explain to their human friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food source . At her home in Europe Square , Sabra Ongola-Stein actually thought that Fancy , the family dragonet , was attacking her three-yearoldson at play in the yard . The little gold was grabbing at Shuvin 's shirt , attempting to haul him from his sandpile and his favorite toy truck . As soon as Sabra had rescued the boy , batting at Fancy , the dragonet had hovered over her , cheeping with relief . It was puzzling behavior to be sure , but , though the fabric of the shirt was torn , Sabra could see no marks on Shuvin 's flesh from the dragonet talons . Nor was Shuvin crying . He merely wanted to go back to his truck while Sabra wanted to change his shirt . To her utter surprise , Fancy tried to duck into the house with them , but Sabra got the door closed in time . As she leaned against it , catching her breath , she noticed through the rear window that other dragonets were acting in the most peculiar fashion . She was somewhatreassured by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the ardor of mating , but that did not seem to be what was agitating them , because greens were wheeling as frantically as the other colors . Greens always got out of the way when a gold was mating . And it was certainly the wrong time for Fancy to be in season . As Sabra changed Shuvin 's shirt , deftly handling the little boy 's squirms , she realized that the cries that penetrated the thick plastic walls of the house sounded frightened . Sabra knew the usual dragon/ets sounds as well as anyone in Landing . What could they be frightenedof ? The large flying creature  --  perhaps a very big wherry  --  that had been occasionally spotted soaring near the Western Barrier Range would be unlikely to range so far east . What other danger could there be on a fine early spring morning ? That smudge of gray cloud far off on the horizon suggested rain later on in the day , but that would be good for the crops already sprouting in the grain fields . Maybe she should get the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that back on old Earth had eliminated the drudgery of monotonous household tasks . Too bad that the council never considered requiring miscreants to do domestic duties as punishment for disorderly conduct . She pulled Shuvin 's shirt down over his trousers , and he gave her a moist , loving kiss . " Truck , Mommie , truck ? Now ? " His wistful question made her aware , suddenly , of the silence , of the absence of the usual cheerful cacophony of dragonet choruses which was the background to daily life in Landing and in nearly every settlement across the southern continent . Such a complete silence was frightening . Startled , restraining Shuvin who wanted urgently to get back out and play in the sand , Sabra peered out the back window , then through the plasglas behind her . She saw not a dragonet in sight . Not even on Betty Musgrave-Blake 's house where there had been the usual natal congregation . Betty was expecting her second child ; and Sabra had seen Basil , the obstetrician , arriving with Greta , his very capable apprentice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a birth . As well established as Landing was , one was still supposed to report anything unusual on Pern . She tried Ongola 's number on the comm unit , but it was engaged . While she was using the handset . Shuvin reached his grubby hand up to the door pull and slid it open , with a mischievous grin over his shoulder at his mother as he performedthat new skill . She smiled her acquiescence as she tapped out Bay 's number . The zoologist might know what was amiss with her favorite critters . Well east and slightly south of Landing , Sean and Sorka were hunt ing wherry for Restday meals . As the human settlements spread , foragers were having to go farther afield for game . " They 're not even trying to hunt , Sorka , " Sean said , scowling . " They 've spent half the morning arguing . Fardling fools . " He liftedp129one muscular brown arm in an angry gesture to his eight dragonets . " Shape up , you winged wimps . We 're here to hunt ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arguing with the mentasynths , most aggressively with Sean 's queen , Blazer . That was extraordinary behavior : Blazer , who had been genetically improvedby Bay Harkenon 's tinkering , was usually accorded the obediencethat any of the lesser colors granted the fertile gold females . " Mine , too , " Sorka said , nodding as her own five joined Sean 's . " Oh , jays , they 're coming for us ! " Slackening her reins , she began to tighten her legs around her bay mare but stopped when she saw Sean , wheeling Cricket to face the oncoming dragonets , hold up an imperioushand . She was even more startled to see the dragonets assume an attack formation , their cries clamors of unspeakable fright and danger . " Danger ? Where ? " Sean spun Cricket around on his haunches , a trick that Sorka had never been able to teach Doove despite Sean 's assistance and her own endless patience . He searched the skies and stayed Cricket as the dragonets solidly turned their heads to the east . Blazer landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left bicep , and shrieked to the others . Sean was amazed at the interactionhe sensed . A queen taking orders from browns ? But he was distracted as her thoughts became vividly apprehensive . " Landing in danger ? " he asked . " Shelter ? " Once Sean had spoken , Sorka understood what her bronzes were trying to convey to her . Sean was always quicker to read the mental images of his enhanced dragonets , especially those of Blazer , who was the most coherent . Sorka had often wished for a golden female , but she loved her bronzes and brown too much to voice a complaint . " That 's what they all give me , too , " Sorka said , - as her five began to tug various parts of her clothing . Though Sean could hunt bare to the waist , she bobbled too much to ride topless comfortably ; her sleevelessleather vest provided support , as well as protection from the claw holds of the dragonets . Bronze Emmett settled on Doove 's poll long enough to secure a grip on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head around . " Something big , something dangerous , and shelter ! " Sean said , shaking his head . " It 's only a thunderstorm , fellas . Look , just a cloud ! " Sorka frowned as she looked eastward . They were high enough on the plateau to have just a glimpse of the sea . " That 's a funny-looking cloud formation , Sean . I 've never seenp130anything like it . More like the snowclouds we 'd have now and again in Ireland . " Sean scowled and tightened his legs . Cricket , picking up on the dragonets ' urgent fears , pranced tensely in place in the piaffe he had been taught , but it was clear that he would break into a mad gallop the minute Sean gave him his head . The stallion 's eyes were rolling white in distress as he snorted . Doove , too , was fretting , spurred by Emmett'speculiar urgency . " Does n't snow here , Sorka , but you 're right about the color and shape . By jays , whatever it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't fall like that . " Duke and Sean 's original two browns saw it and shrieked in utter frustration and terror . Blazer trumpeted a fierce command . The next thing Sean and Sorka knew , both horses had been spurred by wellplaceddragonet stabs across their rumps into a headlong stampede which the massed fair of dragonets aimed north and west . Rein , leg , seat , or voice had no effect on the two pain-crazed horses , for whenever they tried to obey their riders , they got another slash from the vigilant dragonets . " Whatinell 's got into them ? " Sean cried , hauling on the hackamore that he used in place of a bit in Cricket 's soft mouth . " I 'll break his bloody nose for him , I will . " " No , Sean , " Sorka cried , leaning into her mare 's forward plunge . " Duke 's terrified of that cloud . All of mine are . They 'd never hurt the horses ! We 'd be fools to ignore them . " " As if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravine . Sean needed all his skill to stay on Cricket , but his mind sensed Blazer 's relief that she had succeeded in moving them toward safety . " Safety from what ? " he muttered in a savage growl , hating the feeling of impotence on an animal that had never disobeyed him in its seven years , an animal that he had thought he understood better than any human on the whole planet . The headlong pace did not falter , even when Sean felt the gray stallion , fit as he was , begin to tire . The dragonets drove both horses onward , straight toward one of the small lakes that dotted that part of the continent . " Why water , Sean ? " Sorka cried , sitting back and hauling on Doove 's mouth . When the mare willingly slowed , Duke and the other two bronzes screamed a protest and once again gouged her bleeding rump . Neighing and white-eyed with fear , the mare leapt into the water.  |p131nearly  unseating her rider . The stallion plunged beside her , galled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep basin collecting the runoff from the nearby hills , had little beach and the horses were soon swimming , determinedly herded by the dragonets toward the rocky overhang on the far side . Sean and Sorka had often sunbathed on that ledge ; they enjoyed diving from their high perch into the deep water below . " The ledge ? They want us under the ledge ? The water 's fardling1 deep there . " " Why ? " Sorka still asked . " It 's only rain coming . " She was swimmingbeside Doove , one hand on the pommel of her saddle , the other holding the reins , letting the mare 's efforts drag her forward . " Where 'd they all go ? " Sean , swimming alongside Cricket , turned on his side to look back the way they had come . His eyes widened . " That 's not rain . Swim for it , Sorka ! Swim for the ledge ! " She cast a glance over her shoulder and saw what had startled the usually imperturbable young man . Terror lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she urged Doove to greater efforts . They were nearly to the ledge , nearly to what little safety that offered from the hissing silver fall that splatted so ominously across the woods they had only just left . " Where are the dragonets ? " Sorka wailed as she crossed into the shadow of the ledge . She tugged at Doove , trying to drag the mare in behind her . " Safer where they are , no doubt ! " Sean sounded bitterly angry as he forced Cricket under the ledge . There was just room enough for the horses ' heads to remain above the level of the water , but there was no purchase for their flailing legs . Suddenly both horses ceased resisting their riders and began to press Sean and Sorka against the inner wall , whinnying in abject terror. lack your legs up , Sorka ! Balance against the inside wall ! " Sean shouted , demonstrating . Then they heard the hiss on the water . Peering around the frightenedhorses ' heads , they could actually see the long , thin threads plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut every which way with the fins of the minnows that had been seeded in the streams . " Jays ! Look at that ! " Sean pointed excitedly to a small jet of flame just above the lake 's surface that charred a large tangle of the stuff before it landed in the water.  | " Over there , too ! " Sorka said , and then they heard the agitated but exultant chatter of dragonets . Crowded back under the ledge , they caught only fleeting glimpses of dragonets and the unexpected flames . All at once Sorka remembered that long-ago day when she had first witnessed the dragonets defending the poultry flocks . She had been certain then that Duke had flamed at a wherry . " That happened before , Sean , " Sorka said , her fingers slipping on his wet shoulder as she grabbed at it to get his attention . " Somehow they breathe fire . Maybe that 's what the second stomach is for . " " Well , I 'm glad they were n't cowards , " Sean muttered , cautiously propelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a relieved voice , expelling a big sigh . " They 're by no means cowards . C'mere , Sorka . " Glancing anxiously at Doove , Sorka joined Sean and cried out with surprised elation . Their fair of dragonets had been augmented by a mass of others . The little warriors seemed to take turns diving at the evil rainfall , their spouts of flame reducing the terror to char , which fell as ashes to the surface of the lake , where quick fish mouths gobbled it up . " See , Sorka , the dragonets are protecting this ledge . " Sorka could see the menacing rain falling unimpeded to the lake on either side of the dragonet fire zone. lays , Sean , look what it does to the bushes ! " She pointed to the shoreline . The thick clumps of tough bushes they had ridden through only moments before were no longer visible , covered by a writhing mass of " things " that seemed to enlarge as they watched . Sorka felt sick to her stomach , and only intense concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone white about the mouth . His hands , moving rhythmically to keep him in position in the water , clenched into fists . " No bleeding wonder the dragonets were scared . " He smashed impotent fists into the water , sending ripples out . Sorka 's Duke appearedinstantly , hovering just outside and peering in . He waited just long enough to squeak a reassurance , and then literally disappeared . " Well , now , " Sean said . " If I were Pol Nietro , I 'd call that instantaneousflit of theirs the best defense mechanism a species could develop . " A long thread slithered from the ledge and hung a moment in front of their horrified eyes before a flame charred it . Revolted , Sean splashed water on the remains , whisking the float ing motes away from Sorka and himself . Behind them the horses ' breathing showed signs of real distress.  | " How long ? " Sean said , gliding over to Cricket 's head and soothwgthe horse with his hands . " How long ? " " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and it is a totally irrational pattern of behavior . " Her mind rifling through all she knew and had observed about the dragonets , Bay continued to peer out her window . As she watched , a sled lifted from a parking spot near the met tower , and it headed at full speed toward the storm . " Let me check my behavioral files and have a word with Pol . I 'll call you back . It really is most unusual . " Pol was working on the vegetable patch behind their home . He saw her coming and waved cheerfully , tipping back his visored cap and mopping his brow . The garden soil had been carefully enriched and enhanced by a variety of Terran beetles and worms that were as happy to aerate the soil of Pern as of Earth and augmented the local , lazier kinds . Bay saw Pol stop , his hand in midwipe , and stare about him ; she guessed he had only then noticed the absence of the dragonets . " Where 've they all gone ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof . " That was sudden , was n't it ? " " Sabra 's just been on to me . She said their Fancy appeared to attack little Shuvin . For no reason , although her claws did not pierce the skin . Fancy then attempted to enter the house with them . Sabra said she sounded frightened . " Pol raised his eyebrows in surprise and continued to wipe his brow and then the hat band before recovering his head . Leaning on his hoe , he glanced all around . It was then that he saw the gray clouds . " Do n't like the look of that , m'luv , " he said . " I 'll take a bit of a break until it blows over . " He smiled at her . " While we access your notes on the menta-breed . Fancy 's a menta , not a native . " Suddenly the air was full of shrieking , screaming , bugling , and very frightened dragonets . " Where have they been , the little pests ? " Pol demanded , snatching off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " Faugh ! They stink ! " Bay pinched her nostrils , hurrying toward the refuge of the house . " They do , indeed . Positively sulfurous . " Six dragonets detached themselves from the swirling hundreds and dove for Bay and Pol , battering at their backs and screeching to hurry them forward . " I do believe they 're driving us into the house , Pol , " Bay said . When she stopped to study the eccentric behavior , her queenp134grabbed a lock of her hair , and the two bronzes secured holds on the front of her tunic , pulling her forward . Their cries grew more frantic . " I believe you 're correct . And they 're doing it to others , too . " " I 've never seen so many dragonets . We do n't normally have such a concentration here , " Bay went on , cooperating to the point of a lumbering jog trot . " Most of them are wilds ! Look how much smaller some queens are . A preponderance of greens as well . Fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused that the dragonets who were their particular friends had entered the house and were cooperatingin a joint effort to close the door behind the humans . " Most remarkable . " Bay was already sitting down at the terminal . " Patently , it 's somethingharmful to them as well as to us . " " I 'd prefer them to settle , " Pol said . Their dragonets were flitting about the lounge and into the bedroom , the bathroom , and even the addition to the house that had been made into a small but wellequippedhome laboratory for the two scientists . " This is a bit much . Bay , tell your queen to settle , and the others will follow suit . " " Tell her yourself , Pol , while I access the behavioral program . She 'll obey you as well as me . " Pol attempted to coax Mariah to land on his arm . But the moment she touched down she was off again , and the others after her . A tidbit of her favorite fish was ignored . Pol was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if others were experiencing the same mass hysteria and noticed that the squares had been cleared of people . He could see clouds of dust over by the veterinary barns , and the dark dashes of dragonets attempting to herd the animals . He could also hear the distant discord of frightened beasts . " There had better be an explanation for this , " he murmured , pausingbehind Bay to read the screen . " My word , look at Betty 's house ! " He pointed over the screen and out the window toward a structure fully clothed in dragonets . " My God , should I call them to see if they need help ? " When he put his hand out to reach for the door pull , Mariah , screaming with anger , dove at his hand and pushed it away , scratchinghim . " Do n't go , Pol . Do n't go out , Pol ! Look ! " Bay had half risen from her chair and remained frozen in the semicrouch , a look of utter horror on her face . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the hiss of the terrible rain that fell on Landing . They could see the individual elongated " raindrops " strike the surface , sometimes meeting only dust , otherp135times writhing about the shrubs and grasses , which disappeared , leaving behind engorged sluglike forms that rapidly attacked anythinggreen in their way . Pol 's nicely sprouting garden became a waste of squirming grayish " things , " bloating larger within seconds on each new feast . Mariah let out a raucous call and disappeared from the house . The other five dragonets followed instantly . " I do n't believe what I saw , " Pol said in an amazed whisper . " They 're teleporting in droves , almost formations . So the telekinesis was developed as a survival technique first . Hmm . " The hideous rain had advanced , spreading its mindless burden behind and inexorably falling across Pol 's neatly patterned stoneworkpatio toward the house . " They ca n't devour stone , " Pol remarked with clinical detachment . " I trust our silicon plastic roof provides a similar deterrent . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear , " Bay said proudly and pointed . Outside , their dragonets were swooping and soaring , breathing flame to incinerate the attacking life-form before it could reach the house . " I would be happier if I knew the things could not penetrate plastic , " Pol repeated with a slight tremor in his voice , looking up at the opaque roof . He winced and hunched in self-protection as he - heard a slithering impact , then another , then saw the flame spurt briefly in gouts across the dark roof material . " Well , that 's a relief , " he said , straightening his shoulders . " They did strike the roof , however , until the dragonets , bless their little hearts , set them ablaze . " Bay peered out the window facing Betty Musgrave-Blake 's house . " My word ! Look at that ! " The house seemed to be ringed by fiery whirls and gouts as an umbrella of dragonets frantically made certain that not a single piece of the grotesque rain reached the home of a woman in labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binoculars from the clutter on a shelf . He turned them on the fields and the veterinary sheds . " I wonder if they 'll protect our livestock . There 're too many animals to get all safely under shelter . But dragonets do seem to be massing in that area . " Keenly interested in the safety of the herds and flocks they had helped to create , Pol and Bay took turns watching . Bay suddenly dropped the glasses , shuddering as she passed them wordlessly to Pol . She had been shocked by the sight of a full-grown cow reduced in a few moments to a seared corpse covered by masses of writhingp136strings . Pol altered the focus and then groaned in helpless dismay , dropping the binoculars . " Deadly , they are . Voracious , insatiable . It would appear they consumeanything organic , " he murmured . Taking a deep , resolute breath , he raised the binoculars again . " And , unfortunately , to judge by the marks on the roofs of some of those shelters we put up first . carbon-based plastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be terrible . Could this be a regional phenomenon ? " Bay asked , her voice still trembling . " There were those odd circles on the vegetated areas , the ones in the original survey fax . . . " Turning away from the disaster , she sat down at the keyboard and , clearing the screen , began to call up files . " I hope no one is foolish enough to go out after those last few cows and sheep , " Pol said , an edge to his voice . " I hope they got all the horses in safely . The new equine strain is too promising to lose , even to a ravening disaster . " Almost as an afterthought the alarm klaxon on the meteorology tower began to bleat . " Now that 's a bit after the fact , old fellow , " Pol said , turning to focus the binoculars on the tower . He could see Ongola in the tower , holding a rag against his cheek . The sled that had gone out to investigatethe storm was parked so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had probably dived directly from sled to the tower door . " No , the sound carries and sets off the relays , " Bay said absently as her fingers flew over the keys . " Ah , yes , I 'd forgot that . Quite a few people went out on hunting parties this morning , you know . " Bay 's quick fingers stilled , and she turned slowly in the swivel chair to stare at Pol , her face ashen . " There now , old dear , so many people have dragonets now , and al least one of the smarter mentas you developed . " He crossed to het and gave her a reassuring pat on the head . " They 've done a first-class job of warning and protecting us . Ah ! Listen ! " There was no mistaking the exultant warble of the dragonets that always heralded a birth . Despite the bizarre disaster occurring on Pern at that moment , a new life had entered it . The welcome did not . however , interfere with the protective net of flame about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! " Bay mourned . Her plump cheeks were drawn , her eyes sunken in her face.  |p137Heedless  of the stinging pain on the left side of his face , Ongola kept one finger on the klaxon even as he began calling out to the other stations on the network . " Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday at Landing ! Take shelter ! Get livestock tinder cover ! Extreme danger . Shelter all living things . " He shuddered , recalling the horrific sight of two wayward sheep consumed in All eye-blink by the descending vileness . " Shelter under rock , metal , ant water ! An unnatural rain heading westward in uneven fall . Deadly ! Deadly ! Shelter . Mayday from Landing . Mayday from Landing . Maydayfrom Landing ! " Drops of blood from his head and neck dripped in punctuation to his terse phrases . " Cloud unnatural . Rainfall deadly . Mayday from Landing ! Take shelter ! Mayday . Mayday . " His own home was barely visible through the sheeting fall , but he did see the gouts of flame above those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of the thousands of dragonets massing to assist their human friends , of the living , flaming shield over Betty Musgrave-Blake 's home , of the multitude swirling above the veterinary sheds and the pastures , and he remembered that Fancy had tried to fly into the window where he had been sitting out his watch . When he had suddenly realized that none of the meteorologicaldevices were registering the cloud mass approaching steadily from the east , he had phoned Emily at her home . " Go have a look , Ongola . Looks like just a good stiff equinoctial squall , but if the water-vapor instruments are not registering , you 'd better check the wind speed and see if there 's hail or sleet in the clouds . There 're hunters and fishers out today , as well as farmers . " Ongola had gotten close enough to the cloud to register its unusual composition  --  and to see the damage it did . He tried to raise Emily on the sled 's comm unit . When that did not work , he tried to reach Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest sled , a small , fast one that did not have the sophisticated equipment the bigger ones did . He tried every number he could think of and only reached Kitti , who generally stayed in her home , frail in her tenth decade despite prostheses that gave her some mobility . " Thank you for the warning , Ongola . A prudent person is well advised . I will contact the veterinary sheds for them to get the livestockunder cover . A hungry rain ? " Ongola had thrown the little sled to its maximum speed , hoping that there was enough power in the packs to withstand such a drain . I'he sled responded , but he only just made it back to the tower , the engine dying just as he touched ground . The stuff pelted down on the sled canopy . He had not managed top138outrun the leading edge . He grabbed the flight-plan board , an inadequateshield from the deadly rain but better than nothing . Taking a deep breath , he punched auto-close , then ducked out . He took three long strides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tower door just as a tangle descended . The tilted edge of the board deflected the stud right onto the unprotected left side of his head . Screaming with pain , Ongola batted the stuff from his ear just as a dragonet came flaming up to his assistance . Ongola shouted a " Thanks " for the dragonet 's aid as he threw himself inside and slammed the door . Automatically , he threw the bolt , snorting at useless instinct , and took the steps to the tower in twos and threes . The stinging pain continued , and he felt something oozing down his neck . Blood ! He blotted at the injury with his handkerchief , noticingthat the blood was mixed with black fragments , and he became aware of the stench of burned wool . The dragonet 's breath had scorched his sweater . The warning delivered , he was flipping on the recording when a second stinging pain on his left shoulder made him glance down . He saw the front end of a waving strand that did not look at all like wool The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undressed as fast as he did then . And he was just fast enough : the strand had become thicker and was moving with more rapidity and purpose . Even as he watched in horror at his close escape , the wool was ingested , and the grotesque , quivering segment left in its place filled him with revulsion . Water ! He reached for both the water pitcher and the klah thermos and emptied them over the . . . the thing . Writhing and bubbling , it slowly subsided into a soggy inert mass . He stamped on it with as much satisfaction as he had felt destroying Nathi surface positionsThen he looked at his shoulder and saw the thin bloodied line scored in his flesh by his close encounter with that deadly piece of thread . A convulsive shudder took hold of his body , and he had to grab a chair to keep from falling to his knees . The comm unit began to bleat at him . Taking several deep breaths . he got to his feet and back on duty . " Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batten down the hatches . Knew the critters were telling us something but howinell could we guess that ? " Jim Tillek reported from the bridge of the Southern Star . " Thank the powers that be , our ships are all siliplex. "  |p139Monaco  Bay harbor office reported overturned small craft and was instigating rescues . The infirmary reported that human casualties in and about Landinghad been minimal : mainly dragonet scratches . They had the dragonetsto thank for saving lives . Red Hanrahan at Vet said that they had lost fifty to sixty assorted livestock of the breeding herds pastured about Landing , thanking the good fortune of having just shipped out three hundred calves , lambs , kids , and piglets to new homes the previous month . There were , however , large numbers at nearby stakes that did not have stabling Iacilities and were in the path of the abominable rain . Red added that all of the animals left loose to graze could be considered lost . Two of the larger fishing vessels reported severe burn injuries for those who had not made it under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped overboard and drowned when the things landed in a clump on his face . Maximilian , escorting the Perseus , had been unable to save him . The dolphin had added that native marine life was swarming to the surface , fighting over the drowning wrigglers . He himself did not much like the things : no substance . Messages were rapidly stacking up on Ongola 's board ; he rang Emily to send him some assistance . The captain of Maid of the Sea , fishing to the north , wanted to know what was happening . The skies about him were clear to the southern horizon . Patrice de Broglie , stationed out at Young Mountain with the seismic team , asked if he should send his crew back . There had been only a few rumbles in the past weeks , though there were some interestingchanges in the gravity meter graphs . Ongola told him to send back as many as he could , not wanting to think what might have happened to homesteads in the path of that malevolent Threadfall . Bonneau phoned in from Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . He offered to send a contingent . Sallah Telgar-Andiyar got through from Karachi Camp and said that assistance was already on its way . How widespread was the rain ? she wanted to know . Ongola shunted all those calls when the first of the nearby settlementsreported . " If it had n't been for those dragonets , " said Aisling Hempenstahl of Bordeaux , " we 'd all be  --  have been eaten alive . " Her swallow was audible . " Not a green thing to be seen , and all the livestock gone . Except the cow the dragonets drove into the river , and she 's a mess . " " Any casualties ? "  | " None I ca n't take care of myself , but we 've little fresh food . Oh , and Kwan wants to know do you need him at Landing ? " " I 'd say yes , indeed we do , " Ongola replied fervently . Then he tried again to raise the Du Vieux , the Radelins , the Grant van Toorns , the Ciottis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He passed the list over to Jacob Chernoff , who had brought three young apprentices to help . " Kurt , Heinrich , try the River numbers , Calusa , Cambridge , and Vienna . " Ongola called Lilienkamp at Stores . " Joel , how many checked out for hunting today ? " " Too many , Ongola , too many . " The tough Joel was weeping . " Including your boys ? " Joel 's response was the barest whisper . " Yes . " " I am sorry to hear that , Joel . We 've organized searches . And the boys have dragonets . " " Sure , but look how many it took the protect Landing ! " His voice rose shrilly . " Sir . " Kurt tugged urgently at Ongola 's bare elbow . " One of the sleds  --  " " I 'll get back to you , Joel . " Ongola took the call from the sled . " Yes ? " " Whaddya do to kill this stuff , Ongola ? " Ziv Marchane 's anguished cry sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cautery , Ziv . Who is it ? " " What 's left of young Joel Lilienkamp . " " Bad ? " " Very . " Ongola paused and closed his eyes tightly for a moment , remembering the two sheep . " Then give him mercy ! " Ziv broke the connection , and Ongola stared at the console , paralyzed . He had given mercy several times , too many times , during the Nathi War when his men had been blown apart after Nathi hits on his destroyer . The practice was standard procedure in surface engagements . One never left one 's wounded to Nathi mercy . Mercy , yes , it was mercy to do so . Ongola had never thought that necessity would ever arise again . Paul Benden 's vibrant voice broke through his pained trance . " What in hell 's happening , Ongola ? " " Wish the hell I knew , Admiral . " Ongola shook his head and then gave him a precise report and a list of casualties , known or suspected . " I 'm coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heights above the delta on the Boca River . It would soon be dawn there . " I 'll check other stakes on the way in. "  | " Pol and Kitti want samples if they can be safely got  --  of the stuff in the air . It scores holes through thin materials , so be sure to use heavygaugemetal or siliplex . We 've got enough of what ate our fields bare . I 've sent all our big sleds out to track the frigging Fall . Kenjo 's flying in from Honshu in that augmented speeder of his . The stuff just came out of nowhere , Paul , nowhere ! " " Did n't register on anything ? No ? Well , we 'll check it all out . " The absolute confidence in Paul Benden 's voice was a tonic for Ongola . He had heard that same note all through the Cygnus Battle and he took heart . He needed it . Before Paul Benden arrived late that afternoon , the casualties had mounted to a frightening total . Only three of the twenty who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sean Connell , and David Catarel , who had watched , helpless , from the water as his companion , Lucy Tubberman , dissolved under the rain on the riverbank despite the frantic efforts of their dragonets . He had deep scores on his scalp , left cheek , arms , and shoulders , and he was suffering from shock and grief . Two babies , obviously thrust at the last moment into a small metal cabinet , were the only survivors of the main Tuareg camp on the plains west of the big bend in the Paradise River . Sean and Sorka had gone to find the Connells , who had last been reported on the eastern spur of Kahrain Province . No one answered from the northern stakes on the Jordan River . It looked bad . Porrig Connell had , for once , listened to the warnings of the dragonetsand had taken shelter in a cave . It had not been large enough to accommodate all his horses , and four of the mares had died . When they screamed outside , the stallion had gone berserk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to cut his throat . There was no fodder for the remaining mares , so Sean and Sorka returned with hay and food rations . Then they went off to search for other survivors . The Du Vieux and Holstroms at Amsterdam Stake , the Radelins and Duquesnes at Bavaria , and the Ciottis at Milan Stake were dead ; no trace remained of them or their livestock . The metals and heavygauge , silicon-based plastic roofing , though it was heavily pocked , remained as the only evidence of their once thriving settlement . They had used the newly pressed vegetable-fiber slabs for their homes . No one on Pern ever would use such building material again . From the air , the swath of destruction cut by the falling threadlike rain was obvious , the fringes seething with bloated wormlike excrescenceswhich squadrons of dragonets attacked with flaming breath.  |p142The  path ended seventy-five klicks beyond the narrow Paradise River , where it had annihilated the Tuareg camps . By evening , the exhausted settlers fed their dragonets first , and left out mounds of cooked grain for the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing was said about this sort of thing in the EEC report , " Mar Dook muttered in a bitter tone . " Those wretched polka dots no one ever explained , " Aisling Hempenstahl said , her voice just loud enough to be heard . " We 've been investigating that possibility , " Pol Nietro said , nodding to a weary Bay , who was resting her head against his shoulder . " Nevertheless , I think we should arrive at some preliminary conclusionsbefore tomorrow , " Kitti said . " People will need facts to be reassured . " " Bill and I looked up the reports we did on the polka dots  --  " Carol Duff-Vassaloe smiled grimly . "  --  during Landing Year . We did n't investigateevery site , but the ones we examined where tree developmentcould be measured suggests a time lapse of at least a hundred and sixty or seventy years . I think it 's rather obvious that it was this terrible life-form which caused the patterning , turning all organic material it meets into more of itself . Thank heavens most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon-based , we 'd all have been killed , without a doubt . This infestation  --  " " Infestation ? " Chuck Havers 's voice broke in incredulous anger . " What else to call it ? " Phas Radamanth remarked in his dogmatic fashion . " What we need to know is how often it occurs ? Every hundred and fifty years ? That patterning was planet-wide , was n't it . Carol ? " She nodded . " And how long does it last once it occurs ? " " Last ? " Chuck demanded , appalled . " We 'll get the answers , " Paul Benden said firmly.  |p143The  colony 's two psychologists flew in late that evening when the infirmary was still crowded with the injured and shocked , and set to work immediately to help reduce traumas . Cherry Duff had suffered a stroke at the news , but was recovering splendidly . Joel and his wife were both prostrated by the loss of their sons . Bernard Hegelman had submerged his own grief to comfort his shattered wife and the other families bereft by loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they located . Even those uninjured were dazed , some weeping uncontrollably until sedated , others pathetically quiet . Porrig Connell had sent his eldest daughter and his wife to help cope with the survivors , while he stayed with his extended family in the cave . " The first time Porrig Connell ever did anything for anyone else , " his son remarked under his breath to Sorka , who berated him for such cynicism . " He wants to use Cricket to service the rest of his mares when they foal . He expects me to give up my stallion because he had n't trained his ! " Sorka wisely said nothing . With one exception , the distant holdings had contacted Landing , offering either assistance or sympathy . The one exception was the Big Island mining camp , comprised of Avril Bitra , Stev Kimmer , Nabhi Nabol , and a few others . Ongola , running over the log , noticed the absence . Kenjo , appearing like magic from his distant Honshu plateau , headed the aerial survey . By nightfall , he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible " Threadfall , " as it soon came to be called . The original complement of biologists reconvenedat Landing to ascertain the nature of the beast . Kitti Ping and Wind Blossom lent their special skills to analyze the life-forms as soon as samples were brought in . Unfortunately too many , acquired at considerable danger to the volunteers , were found apparently moribund in the metal or heavy plastic containers in which they had been contained . Seemingly , after about twenty minutes , all the frenetic activity , the replications of thep144original strand several thousand times into big wriggling " sausages , " ceased . The form unraveled , blackened , and turned into an utterly lifeless , sticky , tarry mess , within a tougher shell . The captain of the Mayflower , which had been trawling at the ragged northern edge of the Fall , inadvertently discovered a segment of Thread in a pail of fish bait , slapped on a tight lid , and reported the find to Landing . He was told to keep it alive , if possible , by judicious feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Thread had to be housed in the biggest heavygauge plastic barrel on board the Mayflower . Ongola transported the tightly sealed barrel , using a long steel cable attached to the big engineering sled . Only when the crew saw the sled disappearing in the distance would they come on deck . The captain was later astonished to learn that his act was considered one of extreme bravery . By the time the pulsing life-form reached Landing , it coiled , a gross meter long and perhaps ten centimeters in circumference , resembling a heavy hawser . Double-thick slabs of transparent silicon-based building plastic , tightly banded with metal strips , were rigged into a cage , its base quikplased to the floor . Several thin slits with locking flaps were created . A hole the size of the barrel opening was incised in the top , the barrel lid readied , and with the help of grimly anxious volunteers the terrible creature was transferred from barrel to cage . The top opening was sealed as soon as the life-form was dropped into the plastic cube . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others averted their faces . Only Tarvi and Mar Dook seemed unmoved by the creature'swrithing as it engulfed the food that had been placed in the cube . In its urgency to ingest , the thing rippled in waves of gray , greasy colors : sickly greens , dull pink tones , and an occasional streak of yellow flowed across its surface , the image sickeningly distorted by the thick clear plastic . The outer covering of the beast seemed to thicken . The thick shell probably formed at its demise , the observers guessed , for such remains had been found in rockly places where the organism had starved . The interior of the beast evidently deterioratedas rapidly as it had initially expanded . Was it really alive ? Or was it some malevolent chemical entity feeding on life ? Certainly its appetitewas voracious , although the very act of eating seemed to interfere with whatever physical organization the beast had , as if what it con sumed hastened its destruction . " Its rate of growth is remarkable , " Bay said in a very calm voice , fin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided an example ip145the others , all stunned by the sight of that gross menace . " One expects such expansion under the microscope but not in the macrocosm . Where can it have come from ? Outer space ? " Blank silence met her astonishing query , and those in the room exchanged glances , partly of surprise , partly of embarrassment at Bay 's suggestion . " Do we have any data on the periodicity of comets in this system ? " Mar Dook asked hopefully . " That eccentric body ? Something brought in from our Oort cloud ? Then there 's the **26;15636;TOOLONG , which has never been totally discredited , citing the possibilty of viruses . " " That 's one helluva virus , Mar , " Bill Duff said skeptically . " And did n't someone on Ceti III confound that old theory ? " " Considering it drops from the skies , " Jim Tillek said , " why could n't it have a space origin ? I 'm not the only one who 's noticed that red morning star in the east getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it , that the planet with the crazy orbit is coming right into the inner planets , right at the same time this stuff hits us ? Could that be the source ? Is there any data in the library on that planet ? On this sort of thing ? " " I 'll ask Cherry . No , " Bill Duff corrected himself before anyone could remind him that the redoubtable magistrate was indisposed . " I 'll access the information myself and bring back hardcopy to study . " He hurried from the room as if glad to have a valid excuse to leave . " I 'll get a sample from that section pressing against the lower slot , " Kwan Marceau said , gathering up the necessary implements in the rush of someone who dared not consider overlong what he was about to do . " A record 's being kept of the . . . intake ? " Bay asked . She could not quite say " food , " remembering what the creatures had already consumed since they had fallen on Pern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . intake "  --  Pol seized gratehillyon that euphemism  --  " sufficient to keep the . . . organism alive . " " And to see how it dies , " Kitti added in a voice so bland that it rang with satisfaction . " And why all its ilk died in this first infestation , " Phas Radamanth added , pulling the EEC pics out of the welter of hardcopy in front of him . " Did all die ? " Kitti asked . By morning , with no report from scientists who had workedp146through the night , the muttering began : a still-shocked whisper over morning klah ; a rumor that began to seep into every office and the hastily reopened living quarters on the abandoned residential squares . A huge blaze had been started the previous evening and continued to burn at Bonfire Square . Torches , pitched and ready to be lit , had been piled at each corner , and more were added to the piles throughout the day . Many of the lighter sleds that had been on the ground at Landing needed new canopies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken with masks and heavy work gloves . There was a new and respectful title for the winged friends : firedragons . Even those who had previously scorned the creatures carriedtidbits for them in their pockets . Landing was dotted with fatbellieddragonets sleeping in the sun . By lunchtime , a meal was served from the old communal kitchens , and rumor was rife . By midafternoon , Ted Tubberman and a fellow malcontent , their faces streaked and drawn by grief , led bereaved relatives to the door of the containment unit . Paul and Emily came out with Phas Radamanth and Mar Dook . " Well ? Have you discovered what that thing is ? " Ted demanded . " It is a complex but understandable network of filaments , analogousto a Terran mycorrhiza , " Mar Dook began , resenting Tubberman'smanner but respecting his grief . " That explains very little , Mar , " Ted replied , belligerently sticking out his chin . " In all my years as a botanist , I never saw a plant symbiont dangerous to humans . What do we get next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch Tubberman 's arm in sympathy , but he jerked away . " We have little to go on , " Phas said in a sharp tone . He was tired , and working all night near the monstrosity had been a terrible strain . " Nothing like this has ever been recorded on any of the planets humans have explored . The nearest that has been even imagined were some of the fictional inventions during the Age of Religions . We 're still refining our understanding of it . " " It 's still alive ? You 're keeping it alive ! " Ted was livid with irrational outrage . Beside him , his companions nodded agreement as fresh tears streamed down their faces . Murmuring angrily among themselves , the delegation crowded closer to the entrance , every one of them seeking an outlet for frustration and impotent grief . " Of course , we have to study it , man , " Mar Dook said , keeping his voice steady . " And find out exactly what it is . To do that , it must bep147fed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is only the beginning of its life cycle . " " Only the beginning ! " Tubberman cried . Paul and Phas leapt forward to restrain the grief-mad botanist . Lucy had been his apprentice as well as his daughter , and the two had shared a deep and affectionatebond . " By all that 's holy , I 'll end it now ! " " Ted , be rational . You 're a scientist ! " " I 'm a father first , and my daughter was . . . devoured by one of those creatures ! So was Joe Milan , and Patsy Swann , Eric Hegelman , Bob Jorgensen , and . . . " Tubberman 's face was livid . His fists clenched at his sides , his whole body strained with rage and frustration . He glared accusingly at Emily and Paul . " We trusted you two . How could you bring us to a place that devours our children and all we 've achieved the past eight years ! " The murmurs of the delegation supported his accusation . " We "  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " want that thing dead . You 've had long enough to study it . G'mon , people . We know what we have to do ! " With a final bitter , searing look at the biologists , he turned , roughly pushing aside those in his path . " Fire kills it ! " He stomped off , raging . His followers left with him . " It wo n't matter what they do , Paul , " Mar Dook said , restraining Paul Benden from going after Ted . " The beast is moribund now . Give them the corpse to vent their feelings on . We 've about finished what examinations we can make anyhow . " He shrugged wearily . " For all the good it does us . " " And that is ? " Paul inquired encouragingly . Mar Dook and Phas gestured to him and Emily to reenter the containment unit where Poi , Bay , and the two geneticists were still writing up their notes . Wearily , Mar Dook scrubbed at his face , his sallow skin nearly gray as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide containers . " We now know that it is carbon based , has complex , very large proteins which flick from state to state and produce movement , and others which attack and digest an incredible range of organic substances . It is almost as if the creature was designed specifically to be inimical to our kind of life . " " I 'm glad you kept that to yourself , " Emily said wryly , looking over her shoulder at the door swinging shut on a view of the angry group heading away . " Mar Dook , you ca n't mean what you just said , " Paul began , resting both hands on the shoulders of the weary biologist . " It may be dangerous , yes  --  but designed to kill us ? "  | " That is just a thought , " Mar Dook replied , looking a bit sheepish . " Phas here has a more bizarre suggestion . " Phas cleared his throat nervously . " Well , it 's come out of the blue so unexpectedly , I wondered if it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Dumb-founded , Paul and Emily stared at him , aware of Bay 's sniff of disagreement and the amused expression on Kitti Ping 's face . " That is not an illogical interpretation , you know . I like it better than Bay 's suggestion , that this might be only the beginning of a life cycle . I dread what could follow . " Paul and Emily glanced around them , stunned by such a dreadful possibility . But Pol Nietro rose from his chair and cleared his throat , a tolerant expression on his round face . " That is also a suggestion from the fiction of the Age of Religions , Mar , " Pol said with a wry smile . He glanced apologetically at his wife and then noticed Kitti Ping 's reassuring smile . He felt heartened . " And , in my opinion , highly improbable . If the life cycle produced inimical forms , where are the descendants of subsequent metamorphoses ? The EEC team may have erred in considering the polka dots nondangerous , but they also discovered no other incongruous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every other planet in this sector of space was found to be inimical to carbon-based life-forms . " Pol began to warm to his own theory and saw Emily recovering from the shock of the other revelations . " And we have determined that that  --  " He jerked his thumb at the discolored cube . "  --  is carbon based . So that would seem to more or less limit it to this system . And we will find out how . " Pol 's burst of explanation seemed to have drained the last of his energy , and he leaned wearily against the high laboratory stand . " I believe I 'm right , though . Airing the worst possible interpretationsof the data we have gleaned has cleared the air , so to speak . " He gave a little , almost apologetic shrug and smiled hopefullyat Phas and Bay . " I still feel we have missed something in our investigations , " Phas said , shaking his head . " Something obvious , and important . " " No one thinks straight after forty hours on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder to give him a reassuring shake . " Let 's look at your notes again when you 've had some rest and something to eat , away from the stench in here . Jim , Emily , and I will wait and deal with Ted 's delegation . They 're overreacting . " He sighed . " Not that 1 blame them . Sudden grief is always a shock . However , I personally would rather plan for the worst that can happen . As you 've suggestedp149several dire options , we wo n't be surprised by anything that happens . And we should plan to reduce its effects on the settlements . " Paul had a quiet word with one of the psychologists , whose opinion was that the thwarted tensions of the bereaved might be eased by what he termed " a ritual incineration . " So they stepped aside when Ted Tubberman and his adherents demanded the cube and destroyedit in a blazing fire . The resultant stench gagged many , which helped to speed the dispersal of the onlookers . Only Ted and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head slowly . " I think I 'll keep an eye on Ted Tubberman for a while , " he told Paul and Emily . " That was apparently not enough to assuage his grief . " Telescopes were trained on the eccentric planet early the next morning . Its reddish appearance was due , Ezra Keroon suggested , to the aggregated dust swirls it had brought in from the edge of the system . Despite the lack of any proof , the feeling among the observerswas that the planet was somehow responsible for the disaster . During the day , Kenjo 's group discovered traces of an earlier fall on lerne Island , which a witness remembered as more of a rainstorm littered with black motes than a fall of Thread . A scout sent to the northern continent reported traces of recent destruction across the eastern peninsula there . That discovery dispersed the vain hope that the Fall was unique or confined to a specific area . A review of the probe pits from the EEC did nothing to alleviate tension , for the fax incontrovertibly showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They figured that the event must have happened just prior to the team 's arrival . The demand to know the extent and frequency of the falls increased ominously . To assuage mounting fears and tension , Betty Musgrave-Blake and Bill Duff undertook to review the survey 's original botanical data . Ted Tubberman was the only trained botanist who had survived , but he spent his days tracking down every Thread shell and his evenings burning the piles . The psychologists continued to monitor his aberrantbehavior . Based on the original data , Betty and Bill deduced a two-hundredyeargap between incursions , allowing a span of ten to fifteen years for the vegetation to regenerate on the damaged circles after taking into account the age of some of the largest trees in and near the previous occurrence . Betty delivered their conclusion as a positive statement , meant to engender optimism , but she could provide no answer to the vital question of how long the deadly rain would continue to fall.  |p150In  an attempt to disprove Mar 's theory of purposeful design or Phas 's equally disturbing suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Yokohama 's mainframe . His calculations confirmed beyond question that the eccentric planet had an orbit of 250 years . But it only stayed in the inner system for a little while , the way Halley 's comet periodically visited Sol . It was too much to suppose there was no connection , and , after consulting Paul and Emily , Ezra programmed one of the Yokohama 's few remaining probes to circumnavigate the planet and discover its composition and , especially , the components of its apparently gaseous envelope . Though all reports were honestly and fully presented to the communityas soon they came in , by evening speculation had produced alarming interpretations . Grimly the more responsible members tried to calm those who gave way to panic . Then a perplexed Kenjo sought Betty out with a disturbing observation . She immediately informed Paul and Emily , and a quiet meetingwas arranged with those who were able to discuss the situation with some detachment . " You all know that I 've overflown to map the damage , " Kenjo began . " I did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize what was not there . " He paused , as if steeling himself for rebuke or disbelief . " I do n't think all thread starved to death . And crazy Tubberman has n't gotten as far as I have . In most places , there are shells ! But in nine circles that I have seen  --  and I landed to be sure I make no mistake  --  there were no shells . " He made a cutting gesture with both hands . " None . And these circles were by themselves , not in a group , and the area  --  demolished  --  was not as big as usual . " He glanced at each of the serious faces about him . " I see . I observe . I have pics , too . " " Well , " Pol said , heaving a weary sigh and absently patting the folded hands of his wife beside him at the table . " It is biologically consistent that to perpetuate a species many are sent and few are chosen . Perhaps the journey through space vitiates most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few can survive and flourish . It makes more sense . I prefer your theory to some of the others that have been bruited about . " " Yes , but what do they become in the next metamorphosis ? " Bay wondered , her face reflecting depression . Sometimes being right was another sort of failure . " We 'd better find out , " Paul said , glancing around for support . " Is there one nearby , Kenjo ? " When the pilot pointed to its position on the map , Paul nodded . " Good , Chen . Phas , Pol , Bill , Ezra , Bay andp151Emily , just slip out of Landing in small sleds . Let 's see if we can prevent a new batch of wild notions . Report back here as soon as you can . " Paul sent Betty back to her home and her new baby , telling her to rest . Boris Pahlevi and Dieter Clissman were summoned and set to work designing a comprehensive computer program to analyze the data as it continued to come in . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other specialists to return . Poi , Bay , and Phas were the first back , and they brought little good news . " All the insects , slug-forms , and grubs we found on those sites , " Phas reported , " appear harmless enough . Some of them have already been catalogued , but , " he added with a shrug , " we 've barely begun to identify creatures and their roles in the ecology of this planet . Kenjo was right to alert us . Clearly some of the Thread survives to propagateitself , so Bay 's theory is the most viable to date . " Phas seemed relieved . " But I wo n't rest easy until we have discovered the entire cycle . " Late in the afternoon of the third day after that first Fall , an almost hysterical call came in from Wade Lorenzo of Sadrid in Macedonia Province . Jacob Chernoff , who took the call , immediately contacted Ongola and Paul at the administration building . " He says it 's coming straight across the sea , right at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . I 'm holding him on channel thirty-seven . " Even as Paul picked up the handset and punched for the channel , he located the coastal stake of Sadrid on the big map of the continent . " Get everyone in under silicon plastic , " he ordered . " Use fire to ignite the stuff where it hits the suface . Use torches if necessary . D' you have any dragonets ? " The stakeholder 's deep breath was audible as he fought for selfcontrol . " We have some dragonets , sir , and we 've two flamethrowers  --  used ' em to cut down bush . We thought it was just a very bad rain squall until we saw the fish eating . Ca n't you come ? " " We 'll get there as soon as possible ! " Paul told Jacob to tell no one of the new Fall . " I do n't want to cause more panic than there already is , sir , " Jacob agreed . Paul smiled briefly at the boy 's fervor , then dialed Jim Tillek at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were any trawlers southwest near Sadrid . " Not today . Any trouble ? "  |p152So  much for trying to sound casual , Paul thought . " Can you get here to admin without appearing to rush ? " Ongola was looking grimly at the map , his eyes flicking from Mace donia to Delta . " Your Boca River Stake is not that far from Sadrid , " he told the admiral . " I noticed . " Paul dialed the channel link to his stake and in terse sentences told his wife the grim news and instructed her on what precautions to take . " Ju , it may not reach us but . .. " " It 's best to be on the safe side with something like this , is n't it ? " Paul was proud of her calm response . " I 'll give you an update as soon as we 've got one . With any luck , you 've got at least an hour 's leeway if it 's just now at Sadrid . I 'll be there as soon as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough north . This stuff seems to fall in a southwesterlydrift . " " Ask her if her dragonets are acting normally , " Ongola suggested . " Sunning themselves , as always at this time of day , " Ju replied . " I 'll watch them . They really do anticipate this stuff ? " " Ongola thinks so . I 'll check with you later , Ju . " " I 've just got through to the Logorides at Thessaly , " Ongola said . " They might be in the path . Had we better warn Caesar at Roma Stake ? He 's got all that livestock . " " He was also smart enough to put up stone buildings , but call hint and then find out if Boris and Dieter have run their new program . I wish the hell we knew when it started , how far it 'll travel , " Paul muttered anxiously . " I 'll organize transport . " He dialed the main engineering shed and asked for Kenjo . " There 's more Thread ? How far away ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 've got something that could make it in just over an hour . " There was a ripple of excitement in Kenjo 's usually even tone . " Fulmar worked out jet-assist units on one of the medium sleds . Fulmer thinks we could get seven hundred kph out of it , at least , even fully loaded . More if we run light . " " We 're going to have to pack as many of the flamethrowers as possible plus emergency supplies . We 'll use HNO3 cylinders  --  they 'll be like using fire and water at once on the Thread . Pol and Bay do n't weigh much , and they 'll be invaluable as observers . We need at least one medic , a couple of joats , Tarvi , Jim , and me . Eight . All right , then , we 'll be with you directly . " Paul turned to Ongola . " Any luck ? " " Since we ca n't tell them when it started , they want to know when it ends , " Ongola said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate they will be . . . next time . Am I among the eight ? "  |p153Paul  shook his head with regret . " I need you here to deal with any panic . Blast it , but we 've got to get organized for this . " Ongola snorted to himself . Paul Benden was already a legend in organizing and operating at high efficiency in emergency situations . Observers , crew , and supplies boarded the augmented sled within twenty minutes of the initial call , and it was airborne and out of sight before Ongola heard the muted roar of its improved drive . Kenjo drove the sled at its maximum speed , passengers and suppliessecurely strapped in safety harnesses . They sped across the verdant tip of the untouched peninsula past the Jordan River , and then out to sea where the turbulence of sporadic but heavy squalls added more discomfort to an already rough ride in a vehicle not designed for such velocities . " No sign of the leading edge of Fall . Half of that cloud to the south of us is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope and rubbing his eyes . " Maybe , just maybe , " he added softly , " those squalls also saved Sadrid . " Despite the excessive speed , the journey , mainly over water , seemed to continue endlessly . Suddenly , Kenjo reduced speed . The sea became less of a blur to starboard , and on the port side , the vast , approaching land was just visible through the mist of squall . Sunlight broke through cloud to shine impartially on tossing vegetation and denuded alleys . " It 's an ill wind , " Jim Tillek remarked , pointing to the sea , which was disturbed more by underwater activity than by wind . " By the way , before I left Monaco Bay , I sent our finny friends to see what they could find out . " " Good heavens ! " Bay exclaimed , pressing her face against the . thick plastic canopy . " They ca n't have made it here so fast . " " Not likely , " Jim replied , chuckling , " but the locals are feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenjo cried , fighting the yoke of the sled . " If the dolphins can find out where it started . . . Data , that 's what Dieter and Boris need . " Paul resumed manning the forward scope . " Sadrid was n't entirely lucky , " he added , frowning . " Just as if someone had shaved the vegetation off the ground with a hot knife , " he muttered under his breath , and turned away . " Get us down as fast as possible , Kenjo ! " " It was the wind , " Wade Lorenzo told the rescue team . " The wind saved us , and the squall . Came down in sheets , but it was water , not Thread . No , we 're mostly okay , " he assured them , pointing to the dragonets , grooming themselves on the rooftrees . " They saved us ,  |p154just  like I heard they did at Landing . " The younger children were jusi being shepherded out of one of the larger buildings , wide-eyed with apprehension as they looked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bahka are all right . They were trawling . " He gestured hopelessly to the west . " If they went west and north , they'd 've had a good chance , " Jim told him . " But we are ruined , " Athpathis added . The agronomist 's face was a picture of defeat as he indicated the ravaged fields and orchards . " There 're still plenty of seedlings at Landing , " Pol Nietro assured him , patting his back with clumsy sympathy . " And one can grow several crops a year in this climate . " " We 'll be back to you later , " Paul said , helping to unload flamethrowers . " Jim , will you organize the mop-up here ? You know what to do . We 've got to track the main Fall to its end . There you are , Wade . Go char the bastards ! " " But Admiral  --  " Athpathis began , the whites of his large fearful eyes accentuated in his sun-darkened face . " There 's two other stakes in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sled and fastening the hatch . " Straight to your place , Paul ? " Kenjo asked , lifting the sled . " No , I want you to go north first . See if we can find Jiva and Bahka . And until we find the edge of the Fall . " As soon as Kenjo had hoisted the sled , he slapped on the jet assist , slamming his passengers back into their seats . But almost immediatelyhe eased back on the power , " Sir , I think it 's missed your place . " Instantly Paul pressed his eyes to the scope and , with incredible relief , saw the vegetation along the beach tossing in the wake of squall winds . Reassured , he could concentrate on the job at hand without divided priorities . " Why , it just cuts off , " Bay said , surprised . " Rain , I think , " Pol remarked as he , too , craned his neck to see out the siliplex canopy . " And look , is n't that an orange sail ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Indeed it is , and intact . Mark your position , Mister Fusaiyuki , and let 's get to Caesar 's with all available speed . " He took a more comfortable position in his seat and gripped the arm rests . " Aye , aye , sir . " The six passengers once again endured the effects of speed and , once again , Kenjo 's abrupt braking . That time he added such a turn to port that the sled seemed to spin on its tail . " I 've marked my position , Admiral . Your orders , sir ? "  |p155Paul  Benden 's spine gave an involuntary shudder , which he hoped was due more to the unexpected maneuver than to Kenjo 's naval address . " Let 's follow the path and see how wide a corridor it punches . I 'll contact the other stakes to stand down from the alert . " He permitted himself to contact his wife first and gave her a brief report , as much to lock the details in his own mind as to relieve hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " Landing 's report says the stuff often has to be burnt to be killed . " " Send Johnny Greene and Greg Keating in the faster sled . We 've spare flamethrowers with us . " Others volunteered to send their sons , and Paul accepted those offers . Caesar Galliani , making the same offer , added that he wanted his sons back in time to milk the big Roma herd . " I was right , was n't I , " the vet said with a chuckle , " to spend so much energy on stone buildings ? " " You were indeed , Caesar . " " There 's nothing like stone walls to make you feel secure . The boys 'll be on their way as soon as you give me a position . You 'll keep us posted , wo n't you , Admiral ? " Paul winced at that second unconscious use of his former rank . After seven happy years as a civilian agronomist , he had no wish to resume the responsibilities of command . Then his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent from the air , interspersed with untouched swaths where squally rain had drowned Thread before it could reach the surface . Rain and dragonets ! Fragile allies against such devastation . If he had his way . . . Paul halted that train of thought . He was not in command ; he did not wish to be obliged to take command . There were younger men to assume such burdens . " I make the corridor fifty klicks wide , Admiral , " Kenjo announced . Paul realized that the others had been quietly conferring on details . " You can watch vegetation disintegrating by the yard , " Bay said anxiously . She caught Paul 's eyes . " Rain is n't enough . " " It helped , " Tarvi answered her , but he , too , looked at Paul . " We 've got reinforcements coming from Thessaly and Roma . We 'll scorch where we have to on our way back to Sadrid . Set down where you can , Kenjo . Landing will need to know the details we 've gotten today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time all the available HNO3 cylinders were exhausted , so were the crews . Pol and Bay had followed diligently after the flamethrowersteams , taking notes on the pattern of the stuff , grateful thatp156squall activity had somewhat limited the destruction . When Paul had thanked the men from Thessaly and Roma , he told Kenjo to make reasonable speed to Sadrid to collect Jim Tillek . " And so we must arm ourselves with tongues of flame against this menace to our kind and generous planet , " Tarvi said softly to Paul as they finally headed eastward toward a fast-approaching night . " Will Sadrid be safe now ? " " On the premise that lightning does n't strike twice in the same place ? " Paul 's tone was droll . " No promises can be made on that score , Tarvi . I am hoping , however , that Boris and Dieter will soon come up with a few answers . " Then , his expression anxious , he turned to Pol . " This could n't fall at random , could it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Paul , we 've establishedthat we 're dealing with an unreasoning , voraciously hungry organism . There is n't a discernible intelligence , " Pol replied , clenchingand releasing his fist , surprised at his own vehemence , " much less a trace of sentience . I continue to favor Bay 's theory of a two- or three-stage life cycle . Even so , it is only remotely possible that intelligencedevelops at a later stage . " " The wherries ? " Tarvi asked facetiously . " No , no , do n't be ridiculous . We 've traced them back to a sea eel , a common ancestor for both them and the dragonets . " " The dragonets were more of a help than I expected , " Tarvi admitted . " Sallah insists they 've a high level of intelligence . " " Pol , have you or Bay attempted to measure that intelligence when you used mentasynth enhancement ? " Paul Benden asked . " No , not really , " Pol replied . " There 's been no need to , once we demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been other priorities . " " The main priority as of now is establishing the parameters of this menace , " Paul muttered . " We 'd all better get some rest . " Once the rescue team had returned to Landing , it was impossible to deny the fact of the new incursion . Despite a comm silence on their trip , rumors were inevitable . " The only good thing about it , " Paul told Emily as he consumed a hastily prepared meal , " was that it was sufficiently far away from here . " " We still do n't have enough data to establish either frequency or probable corridors of the stuff , " Dieter Clissmann announced . " The dolphins apparently could not find out where or when it started . Marine life does n't keep time . Boris is adding in random factors of temperature variations , high- and low-pressure areas , frequency ofp157rain , and wind velocity to the data . " He gave a long sigh , combing thick hair back from his forehead . " Drowns in the rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some consolation . " Few were as easily consoled . There were even some at Landing who were relieved that other sections of the continent had suffered the same disaster . The positive benefit of fear and horror was that emergencymeasures were no longer resisted . Some had felt that precautionsemanating from Landing violated their charter autonomy . The more outspoken revised their objections when pictures of the devastationon the Sadrid corridor  --  as Pol termed it were distributed . After that , Ongola and his communications team were kept busy briefing distant stakeholders . Tarvi drafted a crew to work round the clock , adapting empty cylinders into flamethrowers and filling them with HNO3 . The easily made oxidant had not only proved to be very effective at destroying Phread but could be synthesized cheaply from air and water , using only hydroelectricity , and was not a pollutant . Most importantly , dragonet hide and human skin were usually not severely damaged from spillage . A wet cloth , applied within about twenty seconds , prevented a bad burn . Kenjo led a group in rigging holders for flamethrowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best defense was not only offense but aerial . He had many willing supportersamong those at Landing who had lived through the First Fall . Fire was the top choice for weapon . As one wit said , since no one had ever figured out how to make rain on demand , fire was the only reliable defense . Even the most ardent supporters of the dragonets did not wish to rely totally on their continued assistance . There were not hands enough to do all the jobs required . Twice Paul and Emily were called in to arbitrate labor-pirating . The agronomistsand veterinarians hastily reinforced livestock shelters . Caves were explored as possible alternate accommodations . Empty warehousesat Landing were made into shelters for any stakeholders who wished to house stock for safety 's sake . Joel Lilienkamp insisted that due to the worker shortage the holders themselves would have to reinforce any buildings they preempted . Many stakeholders felt that that was Landing 's job ; some were unwilling to leave their stakes unless , and until , assured of safe quarters . In eight years , the populationof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original site could house even half the current numbers . Porrig Connell remained in his cave , having discovered that there were sufficient interlinking chambers to accommodate his entire ex/tended family and their livestock . In addition to stabling for his mares and foals , he had also constructed a stallion box in which Cricket had been made very comfortable . Magnanimously , he allowed the survivorsof some other families to remain in his cavesite until they found their own . Because they had been the colony 's leaders , Paul Benden and Emily Boll  --  as well as Jim Tillek , Ezra Keroon , and Ongola found that many decisions were being referred to them , despite the fact that they had stepped down from their previous administrative duties . " I 'd far rather they came to me than to Ted Tubberman . " Paul remarked wearily to Ongola when the former communications officer brought him the latest urgent queries from outlying stakes . He turned to the psychologist Tom Patrick , who had come to report on the latest round of gripes and rumors . " Tom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showdown much longer , " he said , " or you and Emily will lose all credibility . That would be a big error . You two may not want to take command , but someone will have to . Tubberman'sconstantly undermining community effort and spirit . He 's so totally negative that you ought to be thankful that most of the time he 's out trying singlehandedly to clear the continent of rotting Threadshell . Grief has totally distorted his perceptions and judg-ment . " " Surely no one believes his ranting ? " Emily asked . " There 're just enough long-buried gripes and resentments , and good honest gut-fear , right now that some people do listen to him . Especially in the absence of authorized versions , " Tom replied . " Tubberman 's complaints have a certain factual basis . Warped , to be sure . " The psychologist shrugged , raising both hands , palms up . " In time , he 'll work against himself  --  I hope . Meanwhile he 's roused a substantial undercurrent of resentment which had better be counteredsoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They still trust you , you know , in spite of Tubberman 's accusations . " " So the Rubicon must be crossed again , " Paul said whimsically , and exhaled . He caught himself rubbing his left thumb against the insensitive skin of his replacement fingers and stopped . Leaning wearilyback in his chair , he put both hands behind his head as if supportingan extra weight . " I can lead a meeting , Paul , " Cabot said when Paul contacted him on a secured comm channel , " but they subconsciously consider you and Emily their leaders . Force of habit . "  | " Any decision to reinstate us must be spontaneous , " Paul replied after a long and thoughtful pause . Slowly Emily nodded . The last days had aged both admiral and governor . " The matter must be handled strictly on the charter protocol , though by all that 's holy , I never anticipated having to invoke those contingency clauses . " " Thank all the powers that be that they 're there , " Cabot said fervently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things here . Oh , by the way , we also had a few messages across the river early yesterday morning . Did n't notice until about noon today . Hit the southern edge of Bordeaux . We gave Pat and his crew a hand . All 's safe here . " With that , he rang off , leaving Paul dumbfounded . " After our little brush with the stuff , " Cabot said when he arrived in person , " I 'm beginning to appreciate the gravity of the colony 's situation . " A hopeful smile , not echoed by the expression in his keen gray eyes , curved his strong mouth . " Is it as bad as rumor has it ? " " Probably . Depends on the source of the rumor , " Paul answered with an honest grimace . " Depends on whether you 're an optimist or pessimist , " Jim Tillek added . " I 've been in worse fixes on the asteroid runs and come out with life and lung . I prefer to have a planet to maneuver in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smile faded as he regarded the five people gathered discreetlyin the met tower . " Most of what we know , " Paul said , " is negative . But  --  " He began to refute the prevalent rumors by ticking them off on his strong , work-stained fingers . " The Threads are unlikely to be the forerunner of an alien invasion . It was not unique to this area . It did strike the planet in much the same way , to judge by the EEC records , almost exactly two hundred years ago . It may or may not emanate from the eccentric planet , which has a **26;15664;TOOLONG orbit . And although we do not know what its life cycle is , or even if it does have one  --  that is the most viable theory  --  Thread is not the initial stage of tunnel snakes , for example , who have a much more respectable lineage , nor of any of the other kinds of life we 've had a look at so far . " " I see . " Cabot slowly nodded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No reassuring forecast available ? " " Not yet . As Tom here recommends , we need a forum in which to air grievances and correct misconceptions , " Paul went on . " It did n't miss Boca Stake because Paul Benden owns it , or drop on Sadrid because they 're the newest , or stop short of Thessaly because Gyorgy was one of the first charterers to claim his stake . We can , and will , survive this hazard , but we can not have the indiscriminate conscrip/tions of technicians and able-bodied workers . It is apparent to anyone pausing to think that we also can not survive if everyone hares off in opposite directions . Or if some of the wilder notions , including Tubberman 's , are not dismissed and morale restored . " " In short , what you want is a suspension of autonomy ? " " Now what I want , " Paul replied clearly and with emphasis , " but a centralized administration "  --  Cabot grinned at the admiral 's choice of words  --  " Will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make sure that the majority survive . Joel Lilienkamp locked up Stores today , claiming inventory , to prevent panic requisitions . People must realize that this is a survivalsituation . " " Together we stand , divided we fall ? " Cabot used the old saying with respect . " That 's it . " " The trick will be in getting all our independent spirits to see the wisdom , " Tom Patrick said , and Cabot nodded agreement . " I must emphasize , " Paul went on , looking quickly at Emily , who nodded approval , " that it does n't matter who administers during the emergency so long as some authority is recognized , and obeyed , that will ensure survival . " After a pause , Cabot added thoughtfully , " We 're years from help . Did we burn all our bridges ? " Considerable surprise and relief permeated Landing the next morning when Cabot Francis Carter , the colony 's senior legist , broadcast the announcement that a mass meeting was scheduled for the followingevening . Representatives of every major stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend . By the night of the meeting , the electricians had managed to restorepower to one end of Bonfire Square by means of underground conduits . Where lamps were still dark , torches had been secured to the standards . The lighted area was filled with benches and chairs . The platform , originally constructed for musicians for the nightly bonfires , contained a long table , set with six chairs along one side . There was light enough to see those who took places there . When neither Paul Benden nor Emily Boll appeared , a murmur of surprise rippled around those assembled . Cabot Francis Carter led Mar Dook , Pol and Bay Harkenon-Nietro , Ezra Keroon , and Jim Tillek onto the stage . " We have had time to mourn our losses , " Cabot began , his sonorousvoice easily reaching to the very last bench . Even the childrenp161listened in silence . " And they have been heavy . They could have been worse , and there ca n't be one among us who does n't give thanks to our small fire-breathing , dragonlike allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tonight . I wish I had better . We can give a name to the stuff that killed some of our loved ones and wiped out five stakes : it 's a very primitive mycorrhizoid life-form . Mar Dook here tells me that on other planets , including our own Earth , very simple fungi can be generally found in a symbiotic association with trees , the mycelium of the fungus with the roots of a seed plant . We 've all seen it attack vegetation  --  " " And just about anything else , " Ted Tubberman shouted from the left-hand side of the audience . " Yes , that is tragically true . " Cabot did not look at the man or attempt to lighten the tone of the meeting , but he intended to control it . He raised his voice slightly . " What we are only just beginning to realize is that the phenomenon is planetwide and the last occurrence was approximately two hundred years ago . " He paused to allow the listeners to absorb that fact , then stolidly held up his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to predict exactly when and where this Threadfall is likely to strike again , because , unfortunately , it will . But this is our planet , " he stated with an expression of fierce determination , " and no damned mindless Thread is going to make us leave . " " You stupid bastard , we ca n't leave ! " Ted Tubberman jumped to his feet , wildly waving clenched fists in the air . " You fixed it so we 'll rot here , sucked up by those effing things . We ca n't leave ! We 'll all die here . " His outburst started a sullen , murmurous roll in the audience . Sean , sitting with Sorka to the edge of the crowd , was indignant . " Damnfool loud mouth charterer , " Sean murmured to Sorka . " He knew this was a one-way trip , only now everything 's not running smooth enough for him , it has to be someone 's fault . " Sean snorted his contempt . Sorka shushed him to hear Cabot 's rebuttal . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cabot began , his trained voice drowning the murmurs in a firm , confident , and determined tone . " Far from it ! I prefer to think positively . I see this as a challenge to our ingenuity , to our adaptability . Mankind has survived more dangerous environments than Pern . We 've got a problemand we must cope with it . We must solve it to survive . And survive we will ! " When Cabot saw the big botanist gathering breath , he raised his voice . " When we signed the charter , we all knew there 'd bep162no turning back . Even if we could , I , for one , would n't consider running home . " His voice became rich with contempt for the faint of heart , the coward , and the quitter . " For there 's more on this planet for me than First or Earth ever held ! I 'm not going to let this phenomenondo me out of the home I 've built , the stock I plan to raise , the quality of life I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he  --  dismissed the menace as a minor inconvenience . " I 'll fight it every time it strikes my stake or my neighbors ' , with every ounce of strengt 11 and every resource I possess . " Now , " he went on in a less fervent tone , " this meeting has been called , in the democratic manner outlined by our charter , to make plans on how best to sustain our colony during this emergency . We are , in effect , under siege by this mycorrhizoid . So we must initiate measures and develop the necessary strategy by which to minimize its effect on our lives and property . " " Are you suggesting martial law , Cabot ? " Rudi Shwartz demanded , rising to his feet , his expression carefully guarded . Cabot gave a wry chuckle . " As there is no army on Pern , Rudi , martial law is impossible . However , circumstances force us to considersuspending our present autonomy in order to reduce the damagewhich this Thread apparently can  --  and will  --  do to both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm suggesting that a reversion to the centralized government of our first year on Pern be considered at this point in time . " His next words rose to a near bellow to drown out the protests . " And whatever measures are required to ensure the survival of the colony , unpalatable though they may be to us as individuals who have enjoyed our autonomy . " " And these measures have already been decided ? " someone asked . " By no means , " Cabot assured the woman . " We do n't even ye ' know that much about our  --  adversary  --  but plans must be made now , for every possible contingency . We know that Thread falls on a worldwide scale , so sooner or later it will affect every stake . We have to minimize that danger . That will mean centralization of existing food supplies and materiel , and a return to hydroponics . It definitely means that some of you technicians will be asked to return to Land ing , since your particular skills can be best exercised here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work together again instead of going our separate ways . " " What option do we have ? " another woman asked in the slighi pause that followed . She sounded resigned . " Some i uof you have fairly large common stakes , " Cabot answered the most reasonable of tones . " You could probably do quite well o.  |p163your  own . Any central organization here at Landing would have to consider the needs of its population first , but it would n't be the case of Never Darken Our Doorstep Again . ' " He gave a brief reassuring smile in her general direction . " That 's why we meet here tonight . To discuss all the options as thoroughly as the charter 's conditions and The colony 's prospects were initially discussed . " " Wait just a minute ! " Ted Tubberman cried , jumping to his feet again , spreading out his arms and looking around , his chin jutting forward aggressively . " We 've got a surefire option , a realistic one . We can send a homing capsule to Earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need help ! " " I told ya , " Sean murmured to Sorka , " squealing like a stuck pig . Earth lands here , girl , and we make for the Barrier Range and stay lust ! " " I would n't bet on Earth sending any , " Joel Lilienkamp said from the front of the audience , his words drowned by the cries of colonists agreeing with Ted . " We do n't need Earth mucking about Pern , " Sean cried , jumping to his feet and flourishing his arm . " This is our planet ! " Cabot called for order , but very little of the commotion subsided . Ezra Keroon got to his feet , trying to help . Finally , making a megaphoneof his hands , he bellowed his message . " Hold it down , now , friends . I have to remind you all  --  listen to me ! it 'd be over ten years before we got a reply . Of any kind . " " Well , I for one do n't want old Terra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or even First , poking their noses in our business . I'hat is , if they 'd bother to respond . For sure , if they condescended to help , they 'd mortgage all of us to the hilt for aid . And end up owning all the mineral rights and most of the arable land . Or have you all forgotten Ceti III ? I also do n't see why a central administration during this emergency is such a big deal . Makes sense to me . Share and share alike ! " A low murmur of agreement could be clearly heard , although many faces wore discouraged or sullen expressions . " He 's right , Sorka , " Sean said in a voice loud enough for others around him to hear . " Dad and Mother think so , too , " Sorka added , pointing to her parents , who were sitting several rows ahead . " We 've got to send a message , " Ted Tubberman shouted , shaking off the attempts of his immediate neighbors to make him sit down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've a right to help ! What 's wrong in sending a message ? "  | " What 's wrong ? " Wade Lorenzo shouted from the back of the audience . " We need help right now , Tubberman , not ten to thirty years from now . Why , by then , we 'd probably have the thing licked . A Fall 's not all that bad , " he added with the confidence of experience . He sat down amid hoots and shouts of dissent , mainly from those who had been at Landing during the tragedy . " And do n't forget that it took half a century before Earth went to Ceti III 's assistance , " Betty Musgrave-Blake said , jumping to her feet . Other comments were voiced . " Yeah , Captain Tillek 's right . We 've got to solve our own problems . We ca n't wait for Earth . " " Forget it , Tubberman . " " Sit down and shut up , Tubberman . " " Cabot , call him to order . Let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides . His neighbors forced the botanist down and , dismayed by the lack of support , Ted shook off the compelling hands and crossed his arms defiantly on his chest . Tarvi Andiyar and Fulmar Stone moved to stand nearby . Sallah watched apprehensively , although she knew full well the strength belied by Tarvi 's lean frame . Sean nudged Sorka . " They 'll shut him up , and then we can get to the meat of all this talking , " he said . " I hate meetings like this  --  people sounding off just to make a noise and act big when they do n't know what they 're talking about . " Raising a hand to be recognized , Rudi Shwartz again got to his feet . " If , as you 've suggested , Cabot , the larger stakes could remain selfgoverning , how would a central government be organized ? Would the large stakes be at all responsible to it ? " " It 's more a matter of the fair allocation of food , materials , and shelter , Rudi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " You mean , we do n't have enough food ? " an anxious voice broke in . " For now , we do , but if this Threadstuff is planetwide . . . we all see what it did to Landing 's fields , " Joel went on , motioning to the dark , ravaged area , " and if it keeps coming back , well  --  " A woman made a protest of dismay that was clearly audible . " Well , " he went on , hitching up his trousers , " everyone deserves a fair share of what we 've got . I see nothing wrong with going back to hydroponics for a while . We did just fine for fifteen years on shipboard , did n't we ? I 'll take any odds we can do it again . " His jovial challenge met with mixed reactions , some cheering , othersclearly apprehensive.  | " Remember , too , folks , that Thread does n't affect the sea , " Jim Tillek said , his cheerfulness unforced . " We can live , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most early civilizations lived almost entirely from the sea , " Mairi Hanrahan cried in a ringing , challenging tone . " Joel 's right  --  we can use alternate methods of growing . And , as long as we can harvest the sea for fresh protein , we 'll be just fine . I think we all ought to buck up , instead of collapsing under the first little snag . " She stared significantlyat Ted Tubberman . " Little snag ? " he roared . He would have shoved through the crowd to get to Mairi if he had not been restrained . Tarvi and Fulmar moved in closer to him . " Hardly a little snag , " Mar Dook said quickly , raising his voice over the ripple of mixed remonstrance and support . " And certainly tragic for many of us . But let 's not fight among ourselves . It 's equally useless for us to bitch that the EEC team did not do a thorough inspection of this planet and grossly misled us . But this world has already proved that it can survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less resilient with the resources we have at hand ? " He tapped his forehead significantly . " I do n't want just to survive , hand to mouth , " Ted Tubberman shouted , his chin jerking out belligerently , " cooped up in a building , wondering if those things are going to eat their way through to me ! " " Ted , that 's the biggest bunch of bilgewash I 've ever heard from a grown man , " Jim Tillek said . " We got a bit of a problem with our new world that I sure as hell am going to help solve . So quit your bitching , and let 's figure out just how to cope . We 're here , man , and we 're going to survive ! " " I want us to send home for help , " someone else said , calm but firm . " I feel that we 're going to need the defenses a sophisticated society can supply , especially as we brought so little technology with us . And most especially if this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help , we have to take what is sent , " Cabot said quickly . " Lili , what odds are you taking that Earth would send us help ? " Jim Tillek asked . Ted Tubberman jumped to his feet again . " Do n't bet on it . Vote on it ! If this meeting 's really democratic , that is , let 's vote to send a mayday to Federated Sentient Planets . " " I second the motion , " one of the medics said , along with several others.  | " Rudi , " Cabot said , " appoint two other stewards and let 's take a hand vote . " " Not everyone 's here tonight , " Wade Lorenzo pointed out . " If they do n't wish to attend a scheduled meeting , they will have to abide by the decision of those who did , " Cabot replied sternly . He was met with shouts of agreement . " Let the vote be taken on the motion before us . Those in favor of sending a homing capsule to the Federated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hands were duly raised and counted by the stewards , Rudi Shwartz taking note of the count . When Cabot called for those opposed to sending for help , the majority was marked . As soon as Cabot announced the results , Ted Tubberman was vituperative . " You 're damned fools . We ca n't lick this stuff by ourselves . There 's no place safe from it on this planet . Do n't you remember the EEC reports ? The entire planet was eaten up . It took more than two hundred years to recover . What chance have we ? " " That is enough , Tubberman , " Cabot roared at him . " You asked for a vote . It was taken in sight of all , and the majority has decided against sending for help . Even if the decision had been in favor , our situation is serious enough so that certain measures must be initiated immediately . " One priority is the manufacture of metal sheeting to protect existingbuildings , no matter where they are . The second is to manufactureHNO3 cylinders and flamethrower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies . Another problem is keeping a good eastern watch at every stake until a pattern can be established for Threadfall . " I 'm asking that we temporarily reinstate Emily Boll and Paul Benden as leaders . Governor Boll kept her planet fed and free despitea five-year-long Nathi space embargo , and Admiral Benden is by far the best man to organize an effective defense strategy . " I 'm calling for a show of hands now , and we 'll make it a proper referendum when we know exactly how long the state of emergency will last . " A ripple of assent greeted his crisp , decisive statements . " Rudi , prepare for another count . " He waited a moment as the crowd shifted restlessly . " Let 's have a show of hands on implementing those priorities tonight , with Admiral Benden and Governor Boll in charge . " Many hands were immediately thrust in the air , while others came up more slowly as the undecided took heart from their neighbors ' resolution . Even before Rudi gave him the count , Cabot could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency measures.  | " Governor Boll , Admiral Benden , will you accept this mandate ? " he asked formally . " It was rigged ! " Ted Tubberman shouted . " I tell you , rigged . They just want to get back into power again . " His accusations broke off suddenly as Tarvi and Fulmar pushed him firmly back down on the bench . " Governor ? Admiral ? " Cabot ignored the interruption . " You two still have the best qualifications for the jobs to be done , but if you decline , I will accept nominations from the floor . " He waited expectantly , giving no hint of his personal preference in the matter and paying no attention to the restless audience and the rising murmur of anxious whispers . Slowly Emily Boll rose to her feet . " I accept . " " As I do , " Paul Benden said , standing beside the governor . " But only for the duration of this emergency . " " You believe that ? " Tubberman roared , breaking loose from his restrainers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , appearing to lose his professional detachment . " The majority supports this temporarymeasure even if you wo n't . " Slowly the audience quieted . Cabot waited until there was complete silence . " Now , I 've saved the worst news until I was certain we were all resolved to work together . Thanks to Kenjo and his survey teams , Boris and Dieter believe that there is a pattern emerging . If they 're right , we have to expect this Thread to fall again tomorrow afternoon at Malay River and proceed across Cathay Province to Mexico on Maori Lake . " " On Malay ? " Chuck Kimmage jumped to his feet , his wife clutchinghis arm , both of them horrified . Phas had managed to find and warn all the other stakers at Malay and Mexico , but Chuck and Chaila had arrived just before the meeting , too late to be privately informed . " And all of us will help preserve your stakes , " Emily Boll said in a loud firm voice . Paul jumped up on the platform , raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm asking for volunteers to man sleds and flamethrowers . Kenjo and Fulmar have worked out a way of mounting them . Some are already in place on what sleds they could commandeer . Those of you with medium and large sleds just volunteeredthem . The best way to get the Thread is while it 's still airborne , before it has a chance to land . We will also need people on the ground , mopping up what does slip through . " " What about the fire-lizards , or whatever you call ' em ? Wo n't they help ? " someone asked  | " They helped us that day at Landing , " a woman added , a note of fearful apprehension making her voice break . " They helped at Sadrid Stake two days ago , " Wade said . " The rain helped a lot , too , " Kenjo added , not at all convinced of assistance from a nonmechanical quarter . " Any of you with dragonets would be very welcome in ground crews , " Paul went on , willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was skeptical ; he had been too busy to attach a dragonet , though his wife and older son had two each . " I particularly need those of you who 've had any combat or flight experience . Our enemy is n't the Nathi this time , but it 's our world that is being invaded . Let 's stop it , tomorrow and whenever it 's necessary ! " A spontaneous cheer went up in response to his rousing words and was repeated , growing in volume as people got to their feet , waving clenched fists . Those on the platform watched the demonstration , relieved and reassured . Perhaps only Ongola took note of those who remained seated or silent.  |p169If  Dieter and Boris were correct , the oncoming Fall would give the Kahrain peninsula a near miss , beginning at approximately 1630 hours , roughly 120 klicks northwest of the mouth of the Paradise River , 25 degrees south . Dieter and Boris were not sure if the fall would extend as far southwestward as Mexico on Lake Maori , but precautions were being taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squadrons at the required point . Though Thread drowned in the sea , his teams would at least have some practice throwing flame at the " real thing . " " Practice " was not the appropriate term for the chaos that resulted . Kenjo was reduced to snarling peremptory orders over the comm unit as the inept but eager sled pilots plummeted through the skies after Thread , frequently favoring one another with a glancing touch of thrown HNOs . Fighting Thread required entirely different techniques from huntingwherry or scoring a hit on a large flying machine driven by a reasonably intelligent enemy . Thread was mindless . It just fell  --  in a slanting southwesterly direction , occasionally buffeted into tangles by gusting winds . It was the inexorability of that insensate fall that infuriated , defeated , depressed , and frustrated . No matter how much was seared to ash in the sky , more followed relentlessly . Nervous pilots swooped , veered , and dove . Unskilled gunners fired at anything that moved into range , which more often than not was another sled chasing down a tangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpertise , and there was suddenly a marked decrease in the number of wild ones who had joined the fray . In the first half hour of the fall , seven sleds were involved in midair collisions , three badly damaged and two with cracked siliplex canopieswhich made them unairworthy . Even Kenjo 's sled bore scorch marks . Four broken arms , six broken or sprained hands , three cracked collarbones , and a broken leg put fourteen gunners out of action ; many others struggled on with lacerations and bruises . No one had thought about rigging any safety harnesses for the flamegunners.  |p170A  hasty conference between the squadron leaders was called on a secured channel at the beginning of the second hour while the Fall was still over water . The squadron leaders  --  Kenjo , Sabra SteinOngola , Theo Force , and Drake Bonneau  --  and Paul Benden , as leader of the ground-support crews  --  decided to assign each squadrontheir own altitude level at hundred-meter intervals . The squadronwould fly in a stacked wedge formation back and forth across the fifty-dick width of the Thread corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleds to stick to its designated altitude . Once the sleds began to maintain their distances , midair collisions and scorchings were immediately reduced . Kenjo led the most capablefliers at ground level to catch as much missed Thread as possible and to inform the surface crews where tangles got through . Paul Benden coordinated the movements of the fast ground-skimmers , which carried teams with small portable flamers . Channels were kept open to air , ground , and Landing . Joel Lilienkamp organized replacementof empty HNO5 cyclinders and power packs . A medical team remained on standby . By mid-Fall , Paul knew that his ground-support teams were too thinly spread to be truly effective , even though there were , fortunately , substantial stretches where Thread landed on stony or poor soil and shriveled and died quickly . Toward the end , when weary pilots were running low on energy and the sled power packs were nearly depleted , more Thread got through . It seemed to be part of the growing bad luck that it fell over thick vegetation and the home farm of the Mexico Stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge of Maori Lake and the main buildings of Mexico , came as a distinct shock to those who had been concentrating so hard on destroying Thread . Squadron leaders ordered their fighters to land on the lakeside while they had a chance to confer with the ground-crew marshals . Those at Mexico who had not been in ground defense provided hot soup and klah , fresh bread , and fruit , and had prepared an infirmary in one of the houses . Tarvi and the Karachi team had managed to complete metal roofing just before the Fall reached the area . Then Joel Lilienkamp 's supply barge arrived with fresh power packs and HNOs cyclinders . The day was not over yet . Pilots cruised slowly back over the Fall corridor , checking for any " live " Thread . Paul drove himself and his sweat-smeared , soot-covered , weary teams back toward Malay Stake and the coast to try to spot signs of a secondary infestation where no shell or dissolving matter was visible . Only two such points werep171discovered and , on Paul 's order , the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground crew on that detail told the admiral that he thought that was a waste of fuel . " The dragonets were n't at all concerned , Admiral . They are when there 's Thread . " " We take no chances at this stage , " Paul replied , a slight smile removing any hint of rebuke . He did not look upon the fiery bath as an overkill . The dragonets were palpably alerted by Thread , but were obviously unaware of the presence of the second , and possibly more fearful , stage of its life cycle . However , Paul Benden 's respect for the dragonets was increased by their diligent searching out of newly fallen Thread . Several times during the Fall , he spotted the fair of dragonets fighting alongside Sean Connell and the redheaded Hanrahan girl . The creatures seemed to be obeying orders . Their movements had a discipline , while other groups flitted about in a kind of chaotic frenzy . On almost too many occasions , Paul saw the little creatures suddenlydisappearing just when one seemed certain to be seared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sleds had that sort of ability , or even more agility . Sleds were not the most efficient fighter craft . He recalled his admiration of the dragonets during the wherry attack . From accounts of their now legendary " umbrella " defense of Landing from the First Fall , he knew that hundreds of wild ones had assisted their domesticated kin . They could be splendid reinforcements . Paul wondered what the chances were to mobilize all the dragonets to be trained by Connell and Hanrahan . The present Fall had left denuded patches on the surface , but despite all initial bungling and the inexperience of sled and ground crews , the devastation was not as widespread as in the first horrific Fall . Most of the exhausted fighters chose to remain the night at Malay Stake . Pierre de Courci took it upon himself to act as chef , and his team had prepared baked fish and tubers in great pits on the beach . Weary men , women , and youngsters sat around the reassuring bonfires , too spent to talk , glad enough just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorka opened an emergency clinic on the Malay beach to tend the wounded fire-dragonets , slathering numbweed on Threadscoredwings and seared hide . " D' you think that once Sira stops crying , my bronze and brown will come back ? " Tarrie Chernoff asked . She was dirty with black grease and vegetation-green stains , her wher-hide jerkin showing numerousp172char spots , new and old , but like all devoted fire-dragonet owners , she was caring for her creature before seeing to her own relief . Sean shrugged noncommittally , but Sorka laid a reassuring hand on Tarrie 's arm . " They usually do . They get pretty upset when one of ' their own fair 's hurt , especially a queen . You get a good night 's sleep and see what the morning brings . " " Why 'd you give her false comfort like that , Sorka ? " Sean asked in a low voice when Tarrie had trudged back to the bonfires , her comfortedqueen cradled in the crook of her arm . " You know bloody well by now that if it 's hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sean was grim . He and Sorka had been lucky with their fair so far , but then , he had seen to it that their dragonets had the discipline to survive . " She needs a good night 's sleep without worrying herself sick . And a lot do come back . " Sorka gave a weary sigh as she closed the medicine case . She arched her back against tired back muscles . " Give me a rub , would you , Sean ? My right shoulder . " She turned her back to him and sighed in relief as his strong fingers kneaded the strain away . Sean 's hands felt marvelous on her back ; he knew just how to ease away the tension . Then his hands moved caressingly up the nape of her neck and lovingly into her hair . Tired as she was , she responded to the silent question . She stepped away from him , smiling as she looked quickly about to see where their fair had taken themselves . " They 've all found quiet nests to curl up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then let 's find us one of our own . " She caught his hand and led him off the beach and into a thick grove of arrow-leaf plants that they had helped save from Threadscore . Revived by the hot meal and a generous beaker of a very smooth quikal fermented by Chaila Xavior-Kimmage from local fruits , Paul and Emily quietly organized a discreet council , which they held in one of the unscathed Malay outbuildings . Besides the admiral and the governor , Ongola , Drake , Kenjo , Jim Tillek , Ezra Keroon , and Joel Lilienkamp attended . " We 'll do better next time , Admiral , " Drake Bonneau assured Paul with a cocky salute . Kenjo , entering behind him , regarded the tall war ace with amused condescension . " Today taught us that this Thread requires entirely different flight and strike techniques . We 'll refine that wedge maneuver so nothing gets through . Sled pilots must drill to maintain altitude patterns . Gunners must learn to control theirp173blasts . It 's more than just holding the button down . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little dragonets , too . We ca n't risk so many lives , much less the sleds . " " We can repair the sleds , Drake , " Joel Lilienkamp remarked dryly before Paul spoke , " but power packs wo n't last forever . We ca n't afford to expand them uselessly on drills . Despite our resupply system , which I bet I can improve , nine pilots had to glide-land at Maori . That 's clumsy management . That wedge formation , by the way , Drake , is economical on the packs . But it still takes days to recharge exhausted ones . How long will this stuff keep falling , Paul ? " Joel looked up from his calculating pad . " We have n't established that yet , " Paul said , his left thumb rubbing his knuckles . " Boris and Dieter are collating information from the pilot debriefing . " " Hellfire , that 's not going to tell us what we need to know , Paul , " Drake said , his weary tone a complaint . " Where does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , " Ezra Keroon said . " It 'll be a couple a more days before any reports come back . " Drake continued almost as if he had not heard . " I want to find out if the stuff might n't be more vulnerable in the stratosphere . Even if we only have ten pressurized sleds , would a high-altitude strike be more effective ? Does this junk hit the atmosphere in clumps and then disperse ? Can we develop a defense less clumsy than flamethrowers ? We need to know more about this enemy . " " It does n't fight back , " Ongola remarked , rubbing his temples to ease the pounding sort of headache that battle had always given him . " True , " Paul replied with a grim smile as he turned to Kenjo . " I wonder if we would gain any useful data from an orbital reconnaissanceflight ? How much fuel in the Mariposa 's tanks ? " " If I pilot it , enough for three , maybe four flights , " Kenjo replied , deliberately avoiding Drake 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many orbits . " " You 're the man for it , Kenjo , " Drake said with a flourish of his hand and a rueful expression . " You can land on a breath of fuel . " Kenjo , smiling slightly , gave a short , quick bow from the waist . " Do we know when , or where , the stuff hits us again ? " " We do , " Paul assured them in a flat tone . " If the data is correct , and it was today , stakeholders are lucky . It strikes in two places : 1930 hours across Araby to the Sea of Azov , "  --  his expression reflected his continued regret at the loss of Araby 's original stakeowners  --  " andp1740330 from the sea across the tip of Delta . Both those areas are unoccupied . " " We ca n't let that stuff go unchecked anywhere , Paul , " Ezra said in alarm . " I know , but if we 're going to have to mount crews every three days , we 'll all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be protected , " Drake said , unfolding his flight map . " Lots of marsh , scrub land . " " The Fall will still be attended , " Paul said in an inarguable tone of voice . " Look on it as a chance to refine maneuvers and train teams , Drake . It is undeniably best to get the stuff while it 's airborne . Thread did n't eat through as much land today , but we ca n't afford to lose wide corridors every time it hits us . " " Draft some more of those dragonets , " Joel suggested facetiously . " They 're as good on the ground as in the air . " Emily regarded him sadly as the others grinned . " Unfortunately they just are n't big enough . " Paul turned around in his chair to give the governor a searching look . " That 's the best idea today , Emily . " Drake and Kenjo looked at each other , puzzled , but Ongola , Joel , and Ezra Keroon sat up , their expressions expectant . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern coast of Big Island and several small prominences , the remains of volcanoes poking above the brilliant green-blue sea . The one Avril and Stev were eagerly approaching was no more than the crater of a sunken volcano . Its sides sloped into the sea , providing a narrow shore , except to the south where the lip of the crater was lowest . Avril was bouncing with impatience as Stev nosed the prow of the little boat up onto the north shore . " That Nielsen twit could n't possibly be right , " she muttered , hoppingon to the pebbly beach before he had shut off the power . " How could we have missed a whole beach full of diamonds ? " " We had more promising sites . Remember , Avril ? " Steve watched her scoop up a handful of the black stones and sift them through her fingers . She kept only the largest , which she thrust at him . " Here ! Scan it ! " As he inserted the palm-sized stone into the portable scanner , she looked about in angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all be black diamonds . Can they ? " " This one is ! "  |p175She  took back the stone and held it up to the sun for a moment . " And this one ? " She grabbed up a fist-sized rock and pushed it at him , but he was quick enough to see her slip the first stone into her pouch . " It 's lucky that Nielsen kid 's only our apprentice . All this is-ours  --  too ! " " We 'll , '  --  Stev had not missed Avril 's quick alteration  --  " have to be careful not to glut the market . " He put the big stone into the scanner with eager and not quite steady fingers . " It is indeed black diamond . Around four hundred carats and relatively unflawed . Congratulations , my dear , you 've struck it rich . " She grimaced at his mocking tone and snatched the diamond from him , clasping it against her almost protectively . " It ca n't all be black diamond , " she muttered . " Can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep diamonds from being hatched from a volcano , if you have the right ingredients and sufficient pressureat some point in time . I grant you , this might be the only beach composed of black diamond , or any diamond , in the universe , but that 's what "  --  Stev 's grin was pure malice  --  " you , have here . " She glanced at him , her eyes weary , and managed an easy smile . " What we have , Stev . " She leaned into him , her skin warm against his . " This is the most exciting moment of my life . " She wound her free hand about his neck and kissed him passionately , her body pressing against him until he felt the diamond gouging his ribs . " Not even diamonds must come between us , my love , " he murmured , taking it from her resisting fingers and dropping it behind him into the open sled . Stev was not unduly surprised the next morning when he found that both Avril and the fastest sled were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second check in the rock hollow where he knew Avril secreted the more spectacular gemstones that had been found . It was empty . Stev grinned maliciously . She might have ignored the mayday from Landing , but he had not . He had followed what was happening on the southern continent , and kept an eye to the east whenever a cloud appeared . He had made contingency plans . He doubted that Avril had . He would have liked to see her expression when she found out that Landing was swarming with industrious people , the takeoff grid crammed with sleds and technicians . So he roared with amusement when one of their apprentices anxiously reported that she could not find Avril anywhere . Nabhi Nabol was not at all pleased.  |p176Kenjo  achieved orbit with a minimum of fuel expenditure . He kept his mind on the task at hand , feeling the upward thrust of the versatile craft , and the glorious elation of release from gravity . He could wish that all his cares would fall away as easily . But he had not lost his touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the console . The last three days had been frantic , servicing the Mariposa 's dormantsystems , checking any possible fatigue or perishing of essential parts . He had even allowed Theo Force to command his squadron when Thread fell over the mountains southeast of Karachi and brushed Longwood , on Ierne Island . It was more important for him to recommission the Mariposa . Ongola had spared some time to tune the comm unit circuits and help with the terminal checks . The little ship had been designed for inactivity in the vacuum of space , and although the more important circuits had been stored in vacuum containers , there was always the fear that some minor but critical connection had not been properly scrutinized . But finally all systems had proved go-green , and a trial blast of her engines had been reassuringlyloud and steady  --  and Kenjo had objected when forced to rest the last twelve hours before takeoff . " You may be a bloody good jockey , Kenjo , but there are better mechanics on Pern than you , " Paul Benden had told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep you alert in space where we ca n't help you . " A flight plan had been calculated to allow Kenjo to be in the position where Boris and Dieter had predicted the next batch of Thread would enter Pern 's atmosphere . Their program indicated that Thread fell in approximately seventy-two-hour bursts , give or take an hour or two . Kenjo 's mission was to measure the accuracy of ' their program , to determine the composition of Thread prior to entry , and , if possible , to trace its trajectory backward . Also , last but scarcely least , he was to destroy it before it entered the atmosphere . The next Fall was due to hit Kahrain Province , just above the deserted Oslo Landing , continue on to fall over Paradise River Stake , and end in the Araby Plains . Kenjo was a hundred miles below the empty spaceships , but that was too far away for them to register on his scope . Nevertheless he strained to see them , magnifying the viewscope to its limit . Then he shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a new contribution , an unparalleled one . Kenjo Fusaiyuko would discover the source of Thread , eradicate it once and for all , and be a planetary hero . Then no one would condemn him for " conserving " so muchp177fuel for his private use . He could relieve his sense of honor and his scouring bouts of conscience . Building his extra-light aircraft had been most rewarding . He had found the design on tape in the Yokohama 's library , in the **26;15692;TOOLONG . It was not the most fuel efficient , even when he had redesigned the engine , but what he had saved from each shuttle drop had made that saucy plane possible . Flying it over his isolated HonshuStake in the Western Barrier Range had given him satisfaction far beyond his imagining , even if it had given rise to rumors of a large , and hitherto unknown , flying creature . His wife , patient and calm , had ventured no opinion on his avocation , aiding him in its construction . A mechanical engineer , she managed the small hydroelectric plant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next valley . She had given him four children , three of them sons , was a good mother , and even managed to help him cultivate the fruit trees that he raised as a credit crop . She was safe from Thread , for they had cut their home right into the mountain , using wood only on the interior . She had been quite willing to help him carve a hangar for his aircraft with the stonecuttershe had borrowed from Drake Bonneau . But she did not know that he had a second , well-concealed cave in which to store his hoard of liquid fuel . He had not yet managed to transfer all of it to Honshu from the cave at Landing . Yes , no one would object to what Kenjo had done when he brought them the information they sought . And he would see to it that it took three or four missions to do so . He had missed the tranquility and the challenge of deep space . How pitiful his little atmospheric craft was in comparison to the beautiful , powerful Mariposa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader . He had finally returned to his true medium  --  space ! The ship 's alarms went off , and moments later the pinging began . He was in the midst of a shower of small ovoids . With a cry once uttered by long-dead Japanese warriors , Kenjo fired his starboard repulsors and grinned when the screen blossomed with tiny stars of destruction . Avril Bitra was livid . She could not believe the change in Landing , especially as she had counted on it being nearly deserted . When Stev had talked her into taking apprentices so that no one would question exactly what it was they were doing on Big Island , Landing 's populationhad been down to a mere two hundred . But the Landing she found was crawling with people . There werep178lights everywhere , and people bustling about despite the late hour . Worst of all , the landing strip was crowded with sleds , large , small , and medium , and technicians swarmed about  --  and the Mariposa was not there ! What under the suns had happened ? She had settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she had last seen the little space gig . She fumed impotently again over that disappointment . She had a fortune with which to depart this wretched mudball . She had even managed to shake off any companions . She had no qualms about leaving Stev Kimmer . He had been useful , as well as amusing  --  until just lately , until he had assessed those black diamonds . Yes , she had been right to leave immediately , before he thought to dismantle the sleds or do something drastic so that she would be forced to take him with her . Where in all the hells of ' seventeen worlds was the Mariposa ? Who was using up the fuel she needed to get her to the colony ships ? She struggled to control her rage . She had to think ! Belatedly she remembered the mayday . She wished now that she had listened in . Well , it could not have been that serious , not with Landing a hive of industry . Still , that could work in her favor . With so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shivered , suddenly aware of the chill in the night air of the plateau . She was accustomed to the tropical climate of Big Island . Cursing inventively under her breath , she rooted through the sled 's storage compartments and found a reasonably clean coverall . She also girded on the mechanic 's belt she found beneath the coverall . It was probably Stev 's  --  he was always well equipped . She smirked . Not always prepared , however . Before she left to hunt for the Mariposa , she would have to hide the sled . In the darkness , she tried to locate at least one of the dense shrubs that grew at the edge of the strip , but she could not find any . Instead she stumbled into a small hole that proved large enough to conceal her sacks of treasure . She retrieved them from the sled , dropped them into the hole , piled loose stone and dirt over them , and then shone her handbeam over the spot to see if they were well hidden . After a few minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down the grid to the lights and activity . Glancing out of the ground-floor window of the met tower where Drake Bonneau was conducting a training session , Sallah TelgarAndiyarthought she had to be mistaken : the woman only looked likep179Avril Bitra . She was wearing a tool belt and strode purposefully toward a stripped-down sled . Yet no one else Sallah knew had that same arrogant walk , that provocative swing of the hip . Then the woman stopped and began to work on the sled . Sallah shook her head . Avril was at Big Island ; she had not even responded to the mayday , or to the more recent recall to Landing for pilot duty . No one had seen her , or really cared to , but Stev Kimmer 's genius with circuits would have been invaluable . Ongola was trying to get Paul Benden to order the return of Big Island miners . " Do n't keep your fingers on the release button . " Drake 's voice penetrated her moment of inattention . Poor fellow , Sallah thought . He was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If half of what Tarvi had told her about the deadly menace was true , it was devilish to combat . " Always sweep from bow to stern . Thread falls in a sou'westerly direction , so if you come under the leading edge , you char a larger portion . " Drake was running out of space on the operational board , which he had covered with his diagrams and flight patterns . Sallah had yet to fight the stuff , so she had paid attention  --  until the moment when she had thought she recognized Avril . The day had had the quality of a reunion for the shuttle pilots . All the old crowd , with the exception of Nabhi Nabol and Kenjo , had answered the summons . Sallah knew where Kenjo was ; she was a trifle envious of him , and was glad of Nabol 's absence . He would certainly have sneered to be in the company of all the young ones who had earned their flying tickets since Landing . Why , she had known some of them as adolescents . Settling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it had brought so many changes , such as the dragonets perched on young shoulders or curled up on hide-trousered legs . Her own three  --  a gold and two bronzes  --  had , just like her older children , picked up some basic manners . They were perched on the top shelves of the big ready room . Two were mentas , and she wondered if they understood what was going on before their watchful rainbow eyes . Drake 's imperative warning interrupted her musing . " Do n't deviate from your assigned altitude . We 're trying to rig cruising devices that will warn you hair-trigger pilots when you 're out of line . We 've got to maintain flight levels to avoid collisions . We 've got more people to fly than sleds to fly in . You , " he said , jabbing his finger at his audience , " can be replaced . The sled can not , and we 're going to need every one we can keep in the air . " Now , a sweep from bow to stern in a one-second blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catch the end of the stuff and fire runs back up most of it . Do n't waste the HNO3 . " His rapid-fire use of the chemical designation made it sound more like " agenothree , " Sallah thought , losing concentration once again . Damn , she must pay attention , but she was so used to listening foi sounds , not words . And silences . The silence all children made when they were being naughty or trying out forbidden things . And hers were inventive . She felt her lips widen in a proudly maternal smile , then disciplined her expression as Drake 's eyes fastened on her face . She already missed her three older children dreadfully . Ram Da . Sallah 's sturdy , reliable seven-year-old son , had promised to look out for Dena and Ben . Sallah had brought three-month-old Cara with her  --  the baby was safely installed with Mairi Hanrahan 's lot  --  so she was not totally deprived . But Tarvi was back at Karachi , extruding metal sheets on a round-the-clock basis , slaving as hard as the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make each cylinder last as long as possible , " Drake was saying . " Conserve agenothree and power , and you 'll last longer iii the flight line . Which is where you 're needed . Now , most of you have had experience with turbulence . Do n't shuck your safety harness until you 're on the ground . The lighter sleds can be flipped on landing ii the wind suddenly gusts , because they 're nose-heavy with the flamethrowermounts . " With Tarvi on such a schedule , it was just as well that she had work of her own to do , Sallah thought . He had little enough time for her , and she would not even have the comfort of sleeping beside him  --  or be able to rouse him to a dawn lusting when he was too drowsy to resist her caresses . What was wrong with her ? she wondered for the millionth time . She had not trapped Tarvi . The mutual need and passion that day in the cave could not have been faked . When the chance union had resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal arrangement . She had not insisted , but she had been much relieved that the initiative had been his . He had been considerate , tender , and solicitous throughout the gestation , and sincerely overjoyed when his firstborn was a strong , healthy boy . He adored all his children , rejoicingat their birth and in their development . It was his wife he avoided . dismissed , ignored . Sallah sighed , and her old friend Barr shot her a quizzical glance . Sallah smiled and gave a shrug , intimating that Drake had caused he reaction . What would her life have been like with Drake Bonneau , happily ensconced on his lake ? Syenda looked complacent , boastingp181about limiting her childbearing to two . Drake might act the confident flyboy in public , but the previous night he had been noticeably dancingattendance on his imperious wife . Sallah had always thought that Drake was more " show " than " do . " Yet for all Tarvi 's eccentricities , Sallah preferred the geologist and treasured those ever more rare occasions when she could rouse him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be allowed the initiative . No , she had tried that tack , and had gone through a miserable year before she thought of her " dawn attacks . " She had learned some Pushtu phrases from Jivan and artlessly she had inquired about feminine names . Whomever Tarvi called for at the height of passion , it was not another woman . Or another man , from all she could discover . " So , " Drake said , " here is the roster for the next Fall . Remember , it 's a double hit , at Jordan and at Dorado . We 're going to send you Dorado squadrons on ahead so you can be well rested by the time you have to fight . " Again Drake 's eagle gaze swept his adoring students . " Now , back to your sleds to lend the technicians what assistance you can . House lights 'll go out at midnight . We all need our rest , " he concluded cheerfully as he waved their dismissal . Svenda quickly moved to his side , her scowl a deterrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When did you get in , Sallah ? " Barr asked , turning with her usual friendly grin . " I only arrived in from our stake around noon . No one of ' the old group knew when you 'd make it . I did n't realize this thing was so serious until I saw what it had done on my way up . " Sallah laughed . Barr 's bubbling personality had not changed a micro , though her figure had rounded . " How many kids do you have now , Barr ? " Sallah asked . " We 've sort of lost track of each other with you on the other side of the continent . " " Five ! " Barr managed a girlish giggle , glancing slyly at Sallah . " ' The last was a set of twins , which I 'd never have expected . Then Jess told me that he was a twin , and twin births were common in his family . I could have strangled him . " " You did n't , though . " " Naw ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard worker . " Barr gave a sharp nod of her head at each virtue , grinning at Sallah again . Then her mobile face changed to one of concern . " Are you all right , Sallah ? " " Me , certainly . I 've four kids . Brought Cara with me . She 's only three months old . " " Is she at Mairi 's or Chris MacArdle-Cooney 's ? "  | " At Mairi 's . We 'd better check that roster and see when we 're on duty . Where 's Sorka these days ? " Sallah had also lost track of the redheaded Hanrahan girl . " I saw all the others . " " Oh , she 's living with another vet . Over on Irish Square . " " How appropriate ! " Suddenly Sallah felt a surge of resentment . something to do with the freedom young people had and her fi-ustra Lion with Tarvi 's diffidence , along with the sudden realization that she had relatively few responsibilities at that moment and that her professionalskills were once again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink and catch up on our lives ! " Sorka and Sean arrived at their quarters from different directions . Sean from an unexpected meeting with Admiral Benden , Sorka from the barn . She knew by his jarring stride that Sean was barely contain ing a fine fit of rage . He held it back until they were inside the housr " Damm fool , hell'n'damned fool , " he said , slamming the doo- behind him . " That pompous , pig-headed , butt-stupid git . " " Admiral Benden ? " she inquired , surprised . Sean had never had reason to criticize the admiral , and he had been proud to be called t o a special interview . " That stupid admiral wants a cavalry unit ! " " Cavalry ? " Sorka paused as she picked their evening meal out of the freezer compartment . " To charge about the countryside with flamethrowers , no less ! " " Does n't he realize horses hate fire ? " " He does now . " Sean went past her to the small cabinet , hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestively . " Yes , please . If I do n't unwind , too , my food wo n't do me any good at all . " She curtailed her anxiety . The need for a drink indicated hoH tense he was , for Sean was not a drinking man . " We do n't have to eat up above , do we ? " he asked , jerking his head over his shoulder in the direction of the reestablished communit kitchen . " No , I raided Mother 's freezer . " She set the container in the warn ing unit and dialed the appropriate time . Sean handed over her glass and raised his in a toast . " To idioi admirals who are very good in space and real dumb washout stupid about animals . As if we had enough horses to waste in such an asinin caper . He also envisions me training squadrons of fire-lizards "  --  Sea l had persisted in using his own name for them  --  " swooping down of Thread at command . He even feels that he should have one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hatching till summer ! That is , if those flyboys do n't flame ' em all down . " Sorka had never seen Sean so infuriated . He paced about , his face flushed , throwing his left arm out in extravagant gestures , sipping at his drink between phrases as he vented his anger . He flicked his head to flip the sun-lightened hair out of his eyes . A grimace made him appear inscrutable , almost frightening in his anger . On one level she listened to his words , agreeing with his anxieties and opinions ; on another , she reveled in the fact that beneath the contained , almost coldly detached impression he gave most people , there was such a passionate , intelligent , critical , rational , and dedicated personality . Sorka did not quite know when she had realized that she loved him  --  it seemed that she always had but she remembered the day she realized that he loved her : the first time he had exploded in her presence over a minor incident . Sean would never have permitter. himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , if he had not unconsciously needed her soothing affection and reassurance . Watching him work off his aggravation , Sorka permitted herself a small smile which she tactfully hid behind her glass . " Now , Sean , the admiral paid you a compliment , too , " she remarked . She caught his surprised glance and smiled . " By consulting you . I noticed , even if you did n't , that he watched us out there on the Malay corridor , saw how well our fair behaved . And I 'm sure that he knows that you 're more likely than anyone else to discover where the queens are hiding their eggs . " " Humph . Yes , I guess that 's true enough . " Somewhat mollified , Sean continued to pace , but with less agitation . Sorka looked Sean in every mood , but his infrequent explosions fascinated her . His anger had never been directed at her ; he rarely criticized , and then only in a crisp impersonal tone . Some of her girlfriends had wondered how she could stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never found him sullen in her company . Generally he was thoughtful , unwilling to offend even in a complete disagreement , and certainly a man who kept his own counsel  --  unlesshorses were at risk . His lithe figure was graceful even as he thudded back and forth , his heels pounding and leaving dents in the thick wool carpet she had woven for their home . She let his tirade continue , amused by the language in which he described the probable antecedents of the admiral , whom he usually respected , and the idiocyof the entire biological team who tampered with creatures whose natures they had not the wit to understand . " Well , did you offer to find the admiral a dragonet egg when thep184time 's right ? " she asked when he paused for breath after another elaboration of the stupidity of brass asses . " Ha ! I will if I can . " He spun on his heel and sprawled beside he ' on the couch , his face suddenly still , rage and frustration dissipated , his eyes on the amber liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something else was worrying him deeply . She waited for him to continue . " You know as well as I do that we have n't caught a glimmer of any of the wild ones around here . They 've made themselvesscarce since the Sadrid Fall . Jays , if there were anywhere safe on this planet , they 'd find it ! " " There were a lot helping us at the Malay corridor . " " Up until some ijiits started flaming them , too ! " Sean finished the last of his drink to drown his disgust . " We wo n't get the wild ones to help at all if that gets about . " He poured himself another drink . " Say , where 're yours ? " he asked suddenly noticing that the usual perches were vacant . " Same place yours are , out and about , " she answered in a mild tone . Then Sean began to laugh , as much at himself as at the fact that he had only just realized that his fire-lizards had made themselves scarce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it ? " she teased , grinning back at him . He shoved one arm behind her shoulders and pulled her , unresisting , closer to him . " When Emmett told me Blazer was in a tizzy over your righteous wrath , I told mine they 'd have to find their own food tonight . They do n't like cheesy things anyway . " " It 's not often we get a night alone , " Sean said softly , his voice a seductive whisper in her ear . " Finish your drink , redheaded gal . " He ruffled her fringe , then his hand traveled in a caress down her cheek to her chin . " And turn off the cooker , " he added just before he kissed her . Sorka did as she was told , well pleased . It was awkward having to invent excuses to send the dragonets off on specious errands . But even when they were not in season , the creatures delighted in strong emotions , and with thirteen in a chorus of encouragement , the entire neighborhood would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , when the sounds of Landing 's industry were muted , Sorka wondered if she had conceived . Sean slept neatly and quietly beside her , his fingers lightly encircling her upper arm . She had never mentioned a formal arrangement to Sean , or ever pointed out the common assumption of Landing 's population that they were ap185tempered team . She and Sean were of one mind in nearly everything they did , utilizing their veterinary apprenticeship to breed strong horses , finding the very best among the genetic stock available from either the banks or the live stallions . They were soon to sit their final exams in veterinary medicine and they had located the perfect spot for a home  --  a valley halfway down the Eastern Barrier Range . Sean had taken Red to see the proposed Killarney Stake , and her father had approved emphatically of their choice . Sorka took that as a tacit approval of their still informal union . Although Sorka 's parents had acquiesced , Porrig Connell still treated her formally as a guest he wished to see less often . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son back to his proper hearth . She had chosen another daughter-in-law for Sean and sometimesembarrassed all concerned by pushing the girl at Sean on every opportunity . " I wo n't breed so close , Mam , " Sean had informed her when she had nagged him once too often . " It 's bad for the blood . Lally Moorhouse'sfather was your first cousin . We need to spread the gene pool , not enclose it . " Sorka had overheard , but she knew Sean well enough by then not to be hurt that he had said no more about choosing . Perhaps he had not known then that he loved fifteen-year-old Sorka Hanrahan , who was already certain where her heart had been given . She had been seventeen before he had touched her with any kind of passion , and that had been a night to remember . Their roles had become reversed : she , the wanton ; he , the hesitant , tender lover . Her ardent response to his gentle overtures had surprised and pleased them both , but they had not moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had become a custom in their generation to have a trial period prior to a formal declaration before the magistrate . Sorka wanted Sean 's child badly . Ever since that hideous half hour , treading water under a stone ledge , she had been aware of their mortality . She wanted something of Sean just in case . Not that he was wild or incautious , but the Lilienkamp boys had not been reckless , and certainly poor Lucy Tubberman had not . So many people had been wiped out in that First Fall . Sorka did not want to be left with nothing of Sean . She had not tried before to conceive , because pregnancy would have interfered with their plans for Killarney Stake : they needed the work credits for every acre they could purchase . She worried that there was something wrong with her that she had not gotten pregnant before , with all thep186incautious fooling around that she and Sean had enjoyed . But she was no longer fooling . That night she had meant business . Wind Blossom opened the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bay Harkenon-Nietro . Gracefully inclining hey head in welcome , she held the door wide for them to enter . Kitti Ping was seated on a padded chair that , Paul decided , must he raised off the ground under its cover , giving it the semblance of an archaic throne . She looked imposing , a feat for someone half his height . A beautiful soft woven rug had been tucked about a frail body , and a long-sleeved tunic with elaborate embroideries also increased her general look of substance and authority . She raised one delicate hand , no larger than his oldest daughter 's , and indicated that they were to be seated on the stools set in an irregular circle in front of her . As Paul doubled his long legs to sit , he realized that she had achieved a subtle advantage over her visitors . Amused by the tactic . he smiled up at her and thought he could detect the merest hint of an acknowledgment . Only a few strong ethnic traditions had survived the Age of Religions , but the Chinese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained some of their ancient ways . In Kitti 's Pernese house , which was exquisitely furnished with heirlooms from her family , Paul knew better than to disrupt a hospitality ritual . Wind Blossomserved the visitors fragrant tea in delicate porcelain cups . The little plantation of tea bushes , grown to sustain the lovely ceremony , had been a casualty in the First Fall . Paul was poignantly aware that the cup of tea he sipped might be the last he would ever taste . " Has Mar Dook had a chance to inform you , Kitti Ping , that he had several tea bushes in reserve in the conservatory ? " Paul asked when everyone had had time to savor the beverage . Kitti Ping inclined her head in a deep bow of gratitude and smiled . " It is a great reassurance . " Such a bland reply gave him no opening wedge . Paul moved restlessly , trying to find a comfortable position on the stool , and he knew that Pol and Bay were bursting to discuss the reason for the interview . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  Abruptly he modulated his voice which sounded so much louder after her delicate response .  --  " If we had . . . some form of reliable assistance in combatingthis menace . " " Ah ? " Her pencil-thin eyebrows rose , and then her tiny hands made a vague gesture about the armrests.  | " Yes . " Paul cleared his throat , annoyed at himself for being so gauche , and more annoyed that he could be so disconcerted by a trivial seating arrangement . She must know why he had arranged the private conference . " The truth is we are very badly positioned to defend ourselves against Thread . Bluntly , we will run out of resourcesin five years . We do not have the equipment to manufacture either sleds or power packs when what we brought are worn out . Kenjo 's attempt to destroy Thread in space was only partially successful , and there is n't much fuel left for the Mariposa . " As you know , none of the colony ships carried any defensive or destructive weaponry . Even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to move even one ship into an effective position to annihilate the pods . Nevertheless the best way to protect the surface is to destroy this menace in the air . " Boris and Dieter have confirmed our worst fears : Thread will sweep across Pern in a pattern that will denude the planet unless we can stop it . We can not entertain much hope that Ezra Keroon 's probe will bring us any useful information . " Paul spread his hands with the hopelessness that threatened to overwhelm him . Kitti raised her delicate eyebrows in unfeigned surprise . " The morning star is the source ? " Paul sighed heavily . " That is the current theory . We 'll know more when the probe returns its survey . " Kitti Ping nodded thoughtfully , her willow-slender fingers tighteningon the armrests . " We are , Kit Ping Yung , " Emily said , sitting even more erect on her stool , " in a desperate situation . " Paul Benden was heartened in an obscure way to see the governor as much like a nervous schoolchild as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wind Blossom , who stood slightly behind her grandmother 's left side , waited patiently . " If the dragonets were only larger , Kitti , " Bay broke in , her manner unusually brusque , " intelligent enough to obey commands , they 'd be an immense help to us . I was able to use mentasynth to enhance their own latent empathies , but that 's a relatively simple matter . To breed large enough dragonets  --  dragons  --  we need them big  --  " Bay stretched her arms full length and flicked her fingers to indicate room size . "  --  intelligent , obedient , strong enough to do the job needed : flame Thread out of the sky . " She ran out of words then , knowing very well how Kitti Ping Yung felt about bioengineering beyond simpleadjustments to adapt creatures to new ecological parameters . Kitti Ping nodded again while her granddaughter regarded herp188with surprise . " Yes , size , strength , and considerable intelligence would be required , " she said in her softly audible voice . Hiding her hands in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach , she bent her head and was silent for so long that her audiencewondered if she had nodded off in the easy sleep of the aged . Then she spoke again . " And dedication , which is easy to instill in some creatures , impossible in others . The dragonets already possess the traits you wish to enhance and magnify . " She smiled , a gentle , faintly apologetic smile of great sadness and compassion . " I was the merest student , though a very willing and eager one , in the Great Beltrae Halls of Eridani . I was taught what would happen if I did this or that , enlarged or reduced , severed that synapse or modified this gene pattern . Most of the time what I was taught to do worked , but , alas , " she added , raising one hand warningly , " I never knew why sometimes the modification failed and the organism died . Or should have . The Beltrae would teach us the how but never the why . " Paul sighed deeply , despair threatening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " And I will . For though my years are nearly accomplished , there are others to be considered . " She turned to smile gently upon Wind Blossom , who ducked her head with humility . Paul shook his head , not quite believing what she had just said . " You will ? " Bay exclaimed , jumping to her feet . She stopped just short of rushing to Kitti 's raised chair . " Of course I will try ! " Kitti raised one tiny hand in warning . " But I must caution you that success can not be assumed . What we undertakeis dangerous to the species , could be dangerous for us , and can not be guaranteed . It is good fortune of the highest degree that the little dragonets already possess so many of the qualities required in the genetically altered animal that suits the urgent need . Even so , we may not be able to achieve the exact creature , or even be sure of a genetic progression . We have no sophisticated laboratory equipment , or methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let repetition , the work of many hands and eyes , replace precision and delicacy . The task is appropriate , but the means are barbaric . " " But we have to try ! " Paul Benden said , rising to his feet with clenched fists.  |p189All  medical staff not on duty in the infirmary or on ground crew duty , the veterinarians , and the apprentices , Sean and Sorka included , worked shifts as Kitti Ping 's project was given top priority . Anyone with training in biology , chemistry , or laboratory procedures of any kind  --  sometimes even those with nimble fingers who could be put to work preparing slides , or those convalescing from Threadfall injuries who could watch monitors  --  were drafted into service . Kitti , Wind Blossom , Bay , and Pol extracted a genetic code from the chromosomesof the fire-dragonets . Although the creatures were not of Earth , their biology proved not too dissimilar to work with . " We succeeded with the chiropteroids on Centauri , " Pol said , " and they had chains of silicons as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required in order to muster enough people to fight Fall over populated areas . The detailed sequenceof Threadfall , established by the exhausted team of Boris Pahlevi and Dieter Clissmann , gave a structure to which even Kitti 's project had to bow . The resultant four-shift roster attempted to provideeveryone with some time for themselves  --  both to relax and to care for their own stakes  --  though some of the specialists ignored such considerations and had to be ordered to sleep . Everyone over the age of twelve was brought in when Thread fell . The hope that Kenjo , in the Mariposa , could deflect Thread pods in the upper reaches of the atmosphere turned out to be ineffective . The predicted double Fall  --  over Cardiff in mid Jordan and Bordeaux in Kahrain , and over Seminole and Ierne Island  --  was patchy , but the gaps perversely did not include occupied sites . More double Falls could be anticipated : on the thirty-first day after First Fall , Thread would sweep across Karachi camp and the tip of the Kahrain peninsula ; three days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River Stake , while a second Fall would pass harmlessly at sea well above the tip of Cibola Province . After another three days , a dangerous double would hit Boca Stake and the thick forests of lower Kahrain and Araby , stocks of the onep190real wood vitally needed to shore up mine pits at busy Karachi Camp and Drake 's Lake . Ezra spent hours in the booth that housed the link with the Yokohama 's mainframe , scanning the naval and military histories to findsome means of combating the menace . He also sought , with muchless optimism , obscure equations or devices that might be able toalter the orbit of the planet . Then the next Fall could , perhaps , beavoided . Meanwhile , however , the present pass had seeded Pern 's orbit with spirals of the encapsulated Thread , a danger that the colonists would have to face no matter what . He also did comparisons with data from Kitti 's program , delving into science files , using his security ID to access secret or " need to know " information . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relayed back to him . And because everyone knew where to find Ezra , he often intercepted complaints and minor problems that would have added unnecessaryburdens to the admiral and the governor . Kenjo was sent on three more missions , each time trying to find a more efficient way of destroying enough Thread in space to justify the expenditure of precious fuel . The gauges on the Mariposa dropped only slightly with each trip , and Kenjo was commended on his economy . Drake was openly envious of the space pilot 's skill . " Jays , man , " Drake would say . " You 're driving it on the fumes ! " Kenjo would nod modestly and say nothing . He was , however , rather relieved that he had not managed to transfer all the fuel sacks to their hiding place at Honshu . All too soon , he would have to broach that supply to ensure continued trips into space . Only theredid he feel totally aware and alive in every sense and nerve of his body . But each time he brought back useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pod that burned away when it hit the atmosphereof Pern , leaving an inner capsule . About 15,000 feet above the surface , the inner capsule opened into ribbons , some of which were not thick enough to survive in the upper reaches . But , as everyone at Landing well knew , plenty fell to the surface . Most of the sleds were unpressurized , so they had an effective ceiling of 10,000 feet . There was still only one way to clear the Thread from the skies : by flamethrowers . With Thread due to fall on the Big Island Stake on Day 40 , Paul Benden ordered Avril Bitra and Stev Kimmer to return to Landing . When Stev asked what Landing needed in the way of the ores mined at Big Island , Joel Lilienkamp was more than happy to supply a list.  |p191So  when they arrived at Landing with four sleds crammed canopyhighwith metal ingots , no one mentioned their long delinquency . " I do n't see Avril , " Ongola commented as the sleds were being unloaded at the metals supply sheds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew back weeks ago . " He peered back at the landing grid and saw the sun glint off the Mariposa 's hull . " Has n't she reported in ? " Ongola shook his head slowly . " Well , now , fancy that ! " Stev 's gaze lingered thoughtfully on the Mariposa just long enough for Ongola to notice . " Maybe Thread got her ! " " Maybe her , but not the sled , " Ongola replied , knowing that Avril Bitra was too adept at preserving her skin to be scored . " We 'll keep an eye out for her . " Threadfall charts were displayed everywhere and constantly updated ; previous Falls were deleted and future ones limited to the next three , so that people could plan a week ahead . Avril could not have stopped ten minutes in Landing without learning of the dangers of thread . Ongola reminded himself that he must remove that guidance chip from the Mariposa as soon as Kenjo landed . He knew exactly how the space pilot had extended the fuel ; he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . Admiral Benden had been right about Kenjo . Ongola did not want to be right about Bitra ! " Where do you want me to work now I 'm back , Ongola ? " Stev asked with a wry grin . " Find out where Fulmar Stone needs you most , Kimmer . Glad to see you in one piece . " Avril had stayed around Landing that night just long enough to know that she did not wish to be conscripted into any of the several teams who could use her special skills . The only skill she preferred to employ  --  space navigation  --  was thwarted . So , before dawn broke on Landing and before anyone noticed the existence of a spare sled , she lifted it again , loaded with useful supplies , both food and materiel . She touched down on the rocky height above the ravaged Milan Stake , where she had a clear view of Landing and , more importantly , a good view of the busy , illuminated grid where the Mariposa would touch down . She spent the early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an umbrella over the sled 's siliplex canopy . She preferred to take every precaution against the deadly airborne stuff . By midmorning she had camouflaged her eyrie and tuned the sled 's scope on her objective . She was rewarded by a provocative view of Kenjo 's return.  |p192By  listening carefully to all the channels available on the sled 's comm unit , she managed to discover the facts of his mission and its limited success . Over the next several days , she began to feel secure in her hideout Because of the old volcanoes , most air traffic took corridors well t either side of her . During the morning the shadow of the biggest peak lurked over the retreat , like a broad digit pointing directly at her . 11 was enough to make her flesh creep . She had no real appreciation cal views , although the fact that she could look up the Jordan to the bay . or down toward Bordeaux meant that she was unlikely to be slitprised . She began to relax and wait . Considering the reward , she had trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kitti ? " Paul Benden asked the tiny geneticist . He had never found that close surveillance improved performance . but he needed some morsel of encouragement to lighten the depressionof his people . The psychologists reported a lowering of morale as the second month of Threadfall ground on . The initial enthusiasm and resolution was being eroded by fierce work schedules and few distractions . Landing 's facilities , once generous , were crowded with technicians drafted into the laboratories and stakeholders ' families returned to the dubious safety of the first settlement . No one was idle . Mairi Hanrahan had made a game for the five- and six-year-olds with good motor control to assemble control panels by the colors of the chips . Even the most awkward ones could help gather fruits and vegetables from the undamaged lands , or compete with one another in collecting the unusual-colored seaweeds from the beaches after high tides or storms . The seven-and eight-year-olds were permitted to help fish with handlines under the watchful eyes of experienced fishermen . But even the youngest toddlers were beginning to react to mounting tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to their stakes and fly out from their homes to meet Thread . But that would mean splitting up the supply depots and disarranging the work schedules of the more valuable technicians . Paul and Emily finally had to remain adamant on the centralization . That night Kitti regarded Paul and Emily with a wise and compassionatesmile . As she sat erect on the stool by the massive microbiologicalunit , its minute laser units pushed back from the manipulation chamber , she did not appear fatigued ; only her bloodshot eyes showed the strain of her labors . A program was running with whisper/ing clicks , flashing incomprehensible displays on its several monitors , Kitti paused briefly to regard a graph on one screen and a set of equations on another before she returned her gaze to the anxious men . " There is no way , Admiral , to accelerate gestation , not if you wish a healthy , viable specimen . Not even the Beltrae managed to hasten that process . As I mentioned in my last reports , we pinpointed the cause of our original failures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but well worth the effort . The twenty-two bioengineered prototypes we now have are proceeding well into the first semester . We all "  --  her delicate hand made a graceful sweeping gesture that included all the technicians working in the huge laboratoryblock  --  " are immensely cheered by such a high rate of success . " She turned her head slightly to watch the flicker of a reading . " We constantly monitor the specimens . They show the same responses as the little tunnel snakes whose development we understand well . Let us earnestly hope that all proceeds without incident . We have been infinitely fortunate so far . Patience is required of you now . " " Patience , " Paul echoed ruefully . " Patience is in very short supply . Kitti raised her hands in a gesture of impotence . " Day by day , the embryos grow . Wind Blossom and Bay continue to refine the program . In two days we shall start a second group . We shall continue to refine the manipulations . Always seeking to improve . We do not stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and full of responsibility . One does not irresponsiblychange the nature and purpose of any creature . As it was said , the person of intellect is careful in the differentiation of things , so that each finds its place . Before completion , deliberation and caution are the prerequisites of success . " Kitti then smiled a courtly dismissal of the two leaders and turned her complete attention to the rapidly shifting monitors . Paul and Emily executed equally courteous bows to her slender back and left the room . " Well , " Paul began , shrugging off his frustration , " that 's that . " " What city was n't built in a day , Paul ? " Emily asked whimsically . " Rome . " Paul grinned at Emily 's astonishment at his prompt reply . " Old Earth , first century , I think . Good land fighters and road build-ers . " " Militarists . " " Yes , " Paul said . " Hmm . . . They also had a way of keeping people content . They called it circus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after First Fall , with Thread crossing uninhabitedparts of Araby and Cathay and falling harmlessly in the Northern Sea above Delta , missing Dorado 's western prong , Admiral Benden and Governor Boll decreed a day of rest and leisure for all Governor Boll asked department heads to schedule work loads to allow everyone to participate in the afternoon feast and evening dancing . Even the most distant stakeholders were invited to come for whatever time they could spare . Admiral Boll asked for two squadronsof volunteers to fly Thread at 0930 over the eastern corridor . and another two to be ready in the early evening to check the western one . The platform on Bonfire Square was gay with multicolored bunting , and a new planetary flag was hoisted on the pole to flap in the breeze . Tables , benches , and chairs were placed around the square , leaving its center clear for dancers . Vats of quickal were to be broached , and Hegelman would produce ale  --  no one wished to think that it might be the last made for a long while . Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids that gathered them ! Child labor can be efficient , " he said with a grin . The Monaco Bay fishermen brought in shining loads of fish and the more succulent seaweeds to be baked in the big , long-unused pits ; twenty farm stakes donated as many steers to turn on spits ; Pierre de Courci had worked all the previous night , baking cakes and making extravagantsweets . " Better to fatten humans than Thread ! " He was always happiest when overseeing a large effort . " It 's good to hear music and singing and laughter , " Paul murmured to Ongola as they wandered from one group to another . " I think it would be a good custom to establish , " Ongola replied . " Something to look forward to . Reunites old friends , improves bonds , gives everyone a chance to air and compare . " He nodded to the group that included his wife , Sabra , Sallah Telgar-Andiyar , and Barr Hamil Jessup , chatting and laughing together , each withsleepy child on her lap . " We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his wrist chrono and , swearing softly under his breath , went off to lead the volunteers against the western Fall . Ongola was not feeling exactly top of the mark the next morning when he arrived for his watch at the met tower . In fact , he had called in first at the infirmary , where the pharmacist had given him a hang over tablet and assured him that he was one of many . But her corn/ment about disturbing casualties during that Threadfall had only made his headache worse . The report that awaited him at the met tower was a shock and a surprise . One sled had been totaled and its crew of three killed ; a second sled had been badly crumpled , the starboard gunner killed , and pilot and port gunner badly injured in the midair head-on collision . Someone had not been obeying the altitude restrictions . Ongola groaned involuntarily as he read the casualty list : Becky Nielson , mining apprentice just back from Big Island  --  she had been safer after all with Avril ; Bart Nilwan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed his eyes to clear the blur . Bob Jepson was the other dead pilot . Two in the same family . Those twins ! Farting around in break-ass fashion instead of following orders ! Stinkin ' air ! What could he say to their parents ? A minor Fall with a party to come back to , and they died ! Ongola put his hand on the comm unit , about to dial administration . Then he heard someone tapping hesitantly at the door . " Come ! " he called . Catherine Radelin-Doyle stood there , her eyes round , her face pale . " Yes , Cathy ? " " Sir , Mr. Ongola . . . " Either will do . " He mustered an encouraging smile . Considering the amount of trouble Cathy could get into , from stumbling into caves at an early age , to marrying the most feckless joat on the planet , he wondered at her shy demeanor . She was , poor child , just one of those people to whom events tended to occur with no connivance from themselves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes ? " he encouraged when she hesitated . She was constantly findingcaves . " It was n't empty . " Ongola sat up straight . " It had a lot of fuel sacks in it ? " he asked . If Catherine had found it , would Avril ? No , Avril did not have the same sort of luck Catherine had . " However did you know , Mr. Ongola ? " She looked faint with relief . " Possibly because I know they 're there . " " You do ? They are ? I mean , they were n't put there by them ' ? " " No , by us . " He wanted to make as little fuss about Kenjo 's hoard as possible . He had been counting the dwindling numbers and wondering why Kenjo seemed so complacent after each trip . Ongolap196flicked a glance at the corner of the shadowed shelving where the guidance chips were hidden in their darkfoam case . Catherine suddenly sank to the nearest chair . " Oh , sir , you don ' know what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , because everyone knows there 's so little fuel left . And then to see . . . " " But you saw nothing , Catherine , " Ongola told her crisply . " Nothingwhatever . There 's no cave worth noticing down that particular crevasse and you wo n't say a thing about it to anyone else . I will personally tell the admiral . But you will tell no one . " " Oh no , sir . " " This information can not  --  I repeat , can not  --  be divulged to any other person . " " That 's right , Mr. Ongola . " She nodded solemnly several times . Then she smiled winsomely . " Shall I keep on looking ? " " Yes , I think you 'd better . And find something ! " " Oh , but I have , Mr. Ongola , and Joel Lilienkamp says they 're going to be excellent storage space . " Her face clouded briefly . " But he did n't say for what . " " Go , Cathy , and find something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely returned to brooding over the first serious losses to their defense when Tarvi came storming up the stairs . " It 's been staring us in the face , Zi , " he said , swinging his arms in one of his expansive gestures . His face was alight with enthusiasm , although his skin looked a bit gray from the excesses of the night before . " What ? " Ongola was in no mood for puzzles . " Them ! There ! " Tarvi gestured extravagantly out the northern windows . " All the time . " It was probably the headache , Ongola thought , but he had no idea what Tarvi was talking about . " What do you mean ? " " All this time we have been slavering away at mining ore , refining. molding it , adding weeks to our labors , when all the time we 've had what we need in front of us . " " No puzzles , Tarvi . " Tarvi 's expressive eyes widened in surprise and consternation . " I give you no puzzles , Zi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and materials . The shuttles , Zi , the shuttles can be dismantledand their components used for our specific purposes here and now . Theirs is done . Why let them slowly decay on the meadow ? " Tarvip197emphasized each new sentence with a flick of long fingers out the window and then , exasperated with Ongola 's incomprehension , he hauled the man to his feet and pointed a very long , slightly dirty forefinger directly at the tail fins of the old shuttles . " There . We 'll use them . Hundreds of relays , miles of the proper flex and tubing , six small mountains of recyclable material . Have you any idea of how much is in them ? " In an instant , all the exuberance drained from the volatile geologist . He put both hands on Ongola 's shoulders . " We can replace the sled we lost today even if we can not replace those marvelous young lives or comfort their stricken families . The parts make a new whole . " Work dulled the edge of the sorrow that hung over Landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors reluctantly admitted that the Jepson twins , toward the end of that Fall , had indulged in some fatal foolery . Ben 's sled had been scheduled for servicing after the Fall because its previous pilot had reported a sluggish reaction on port side turns . The sled had been considered safe enough for what should have been a monitoring flight . Rather than prevent other such collisions , the next few Falls saw a rash of them even as Tarvi 's crew began to strip the first shuttle and Fulmar 's teams began to service and replace from the bonanza of salvage . The longest hours were still put in at Kitti Ping 's laboratory , monitoringthe development of the specimens for any signs of aberration from the program . " Patience , " was Kitti 's response to all queries . " All proceeds vigor-ously . " Three days after the midair collision , Wind Blossom discovered her grandmother still at the electronic microscope , apparently peering at yet another slide . But when Wind Blossom touched Kitti 's arm , the movement produced an unexpected result . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the body slumped forward , only kept upright by the brace that held her to the stool for her long sessions at the microscope . Wind Blossom let out a moan and dropped to her knees , holding one tiny cold hand to her forehead . Bay heard her disconsolate weeping and came to see what had happened . Instantly she called to Pol and Kwan , then phoned for a doctor . Once Wind Blossom had followed the gurney carrying her grandmother 's body out of the room , Bay straightened her plumpp198shoulders and stood at the console . She asked the computer if it had finished its program . PROGRAM COMPLETED flashed on the screen  --  almost indignantly , Bay thought in the portion of her mind that was not sorrowing . She tapped out an information query . The screen displayed a dazzling series of computations and ended with REMOVE UNIT ! DANGER IF UNITIS NOT IMMEDIATELY REMOVED ! Astonished , Bay recognized the paraphernalia on the workspace beside the electronic microscope . Kitti Ping had been manipulating gene patterns again , a complicated process that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ping 's encouragements . So Kitti had made those infinitesimal alterations in the chromosomes Bay felt the chill of a terrible apprehension sweep through her plump body . She pressed her lips together . That moment was not the time to panic . They must not lose what Kitti Ping had been making of the raw material of Pern . With hands that were not quite steady , she unlocked the microcylinder , removed the tiny gel-encapsulated unit , and placed it in the culture dish that Kitti had readied . An agony as severe as a knife stab almost doubled Bay up , but she fought the grief and the knowledge that Kit Ping Yung had died to produce that altered egg cell . The label was even prepared : Trial 2684/16/M : nucleus #22A , mentasynth Generation B2 , boron/silicon system 4 , size 2H ; 16.204.8 . Walking as fast as her shaky legs would permit and gradually recoveringher composure , Bay took the final legacy of the brilliant technicianto the gestation chamber and put it carefully beside the forty-one similar units that held the hopes of Pern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ezra told Paul and Emily , his quiet voice ragged with disappointment . " When the first one blew up , or whatever , I thought it a mischance . Even vacuum is n't perfect insulation against decay . Probe motors could misfire , their recording device clog somehow or other . So I refined the program for the second one . It got exactly as far as the first one , and then every light went red . Either that atmosphere is so corrosive even our probe enamels melt , or the garage on the Yokohama has somehow been damaged , and the probes , too . I du n no , guys . " Ezra was not much given to agitated gestures but he paced up and down Paul 's office , strutting and waving his arms about him like a scarecrow in a high wind . The last few days had wearied and aged him . Paul and Emily exchanged concerned glances . Kitti Ping 's death had been such a shock , following so closely on the sled collisionp199disaster . The geneticist had seemed so indestructible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frailty . She had exuded a quality of immortality , however false that had proved . " Whose theory was it that we were being bombarded from outer space to reduce us to submission ? " Ezra asked , stopping suddenly in his tracks and staring at the two leaders . " Ah , c'm on now , Ezra ! " Paul was bluntly derisive . " Think a minute , man . We 're all under a strain , but not one that makes us lose our wits . We all know that there are atmospheres that can and have melted probes . Furthermore  --  " He halted , not certain what would suffice to reassure Ezra , and himself . " Furthermore , the organism attacking us , " Emily went on with superb composure , " is hydrocarbon based , and if it comes from that planet , its atmosphere is not corrosive . I favor malfunction . " " My opinion , too , " Paul said , nodding his head vigorously . " Fardles , Ezra , let 's not talk ourselves into more problems than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ezra brought both fists down on the desk  --  " to probe that planet , or we wo n't know enough to combat the stuff . Half the settlers want to know the source and destroy it so we can get back to our lives . Rake up the debris and forget all this . " " What are n't you telling us , Ezra ? " Emily asked , cocking her head slightly and regarding the captain with an unflinching gaze . Ezra stared back at her for a very long moment , then straightened from his half crouch over the desk and began to smile wryly . " You 've been sitting in the interface booth long hours , Ezra , and you were n't playing tiddlywinks while the programs were running , " Emily went on . " My calculations are frightening , " he said in a low voice , glancing over each shoulder . " If the program is in any way accurate , and I 've run it five times now from start to finish , we have to put up with ' Thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner system . " " How long will that be ? " Paul felt his fingers gripping the arm rests and made a conscious effort to relax them while he tried to recall some reassuring facet of planetary orbits . " I get between forty and fifty years ! " Emily grimaced , her mouth forming an 0 of surprise before she slowly exhaled . " Forty or fifty years , you say . " " If , " Ezra added grimly , " the menace originated from that planet . " Paul caught his eyes and saw the ineffably weary and discouraged look in them . " If ? There is another alternative ? " " I have discerned a haze about the planet , irrespective of its atmo/spheric envelope . A haze that spreads backward in this system and swirls along the eccentric 's path . I can not refine that telescope enough to tell more . It could be space debris , a nebulosity , the remnants of a cometary tail , a whole bunch of things that are harm-less . " " But if it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take nearly fifty years to diffuse out of Pern 's orbit . some into Rukbat  --  the rest , who knows ? " There was a long moment of silence . " Any suggestions ? " Paul asked finally . " Yes , " Ezra said , straightening his shoulders with a wrench . He held up two fingers . " Take a trip to the Yokohama , find out what 's bugging the probes , and send two of ' em down to the planet to gather as much information as we can . Send the other two along the line uI that cometary dust and use the Yoko 's more powerful space scope with no planetary interference to see if we can identify its source and components . " Ezra then locked his fingers together and cracked his knuckles , a habit that always made Emily shudder . " Sorry , Em . " " At least you can recommend some positive action , " Paul went on . " The big question is , Paul , is there enough fuel to get someone to the Yoko and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . " " Good pilot , " Paul said discreetly . " There 's enough for what we need now . Kenjo will pilot , and did you wish to go with him ? " Ezra shook his head slowly . " Avril Bitra has the training for the job . " " Avril ? " Paul gave a harsh bark and then shook his head , grinning sourly . " Avril 's the last person I 'd put on the Mariposa for any reason . Even if we knew where she is . " " Really ? " Ezra looked at Emily for an explanation , but she shrugged . " Well , then , Kenjo can double . No , " he corrected himsell . " If something 's wrong with the probes , we 'd need a good technician . Stev Kimmer . He 's back , is n't he ? " " Who else ? " Paul jotted down names rather than worry Ezra with more suspicions . " Kenjo is a very capable technician , " Emily insisted . " There should be two on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , furrowing his brow . " This mission has got to give us the results we need . " " Zi Ongola , " Paul suggested . " Yes , the very one , " Ezra agreed . " If he runs into any trouble , I can have Stev at the interface for expert advice . "  | " Forty years , huh ? " Emily said , watching Paul underline the two final choices on the pad . " Rather longer than we 'd bargained for , my friend . Let 's start training replacements . " Inevitably their thoughts went to Wind Blossom , so obviously a frail vessel to continue the work her grandmother had begun . Avrii 's suspicious nature was aroused not by anything she heard , although what she did not hear was as significant , but by what she saw in the weary hours she manned the sled 's scope . It was usually trained on the Mariposa , sitting at the far end of the landing grid . The night before every one of Kenjo 's jaunts he had done exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her use of the nickname was not quite derisive , because she simply could not figure out how he had managed to stretch the small reserve of fuel on the Mariposa as far as he already had . She had seen some activity about it last night but no sign rf Kenjo . In fact , with neither moon out , she had just barely seen the shifting of shadow that indicated activity about the craft . She had been quite agitated . The only thing that reassured her was that severalfigures were involved . But no one entered the gig . That perplexedher . ' At first light , so early that no one was yet working the donks at the skeleton of the shuttle that had been the center of considerable activity all week , she was surprised to see Fulmar Stone and Zi Ongola approaching the vessel . Her apprehension , honed by weeks of waiting , spurred her to remove the protective cover from her sled in preparation for a quick departure . At full speed , she could reach the landing grid in less than fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her cover . She had a moment 's anxiety thinking that perhaps the Mariposa had developed a problem and they were scavenging replacement parts from the shuttle . Kenjo had flown a mission three days before with his usual economical takeoff and landing . She had to hand it to him  --  he was gliding in smoothly with no power at all . Only where was he getting the fuel to lift ? The three men , moving with almost stealthy speed , slipped inside the little spaceship and closed the airlock . Well , the access to the engines was through exterior panels , so she began to relax . They remained inside the ship for three hours , long enough for a full ulterior systems check . But that did not presage a usual flight . Maybe the Mariposa was bollixed . Scorch Kenjo for ineptitude . The Mariposa had to be spaceworthy . Avril swore . Or had something happened to Kenjo so that Ongola was takingp202the ship up ? But how ? There could not be much fuel left . So why w they checking internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Displeased , Avril finished her preparations to fly . Sallah Telgar-Andiyar was feeding her daughter her breakfast in t shady covered porch of Maki Hanrahan 's Asian Square house wIe she caught sight of a familiar figure striding down the path . It w covered by loose overalls , and a peaked cap was pulled well do over the face , but the walk was undeniably Avril 's , especially from t rear . Never mind the greasy hands , the exhaust pipe carried so ost tatiously in one hand , the clipboard in the other . That was Avril , w only sullied her hands for a good cause . No one had seen her sin she had left Big Island . Sallah continued to watch until Avril mingl in with the crowd at the main depot , where technicians jostled o another for parts and materiel . Ever since Sallah had overheard Avril 's conversation with Kimm she had known the woman would attempt to leave Pern . Did Av know of Kenjo 's fuel dump ? Irritably Sallah shook her head . Ca blinked her huge brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , your mother 's mind is klicks away . " Sallah gather more puree on the spoon and deposited it into Cara 's obedient open mouth . No , Sallah told herself fiercely , because she wanted t believe it so badly , Avril could not have discovered that fuel : she h been too busy mining gemstones on Big Island . At least , up unt three weeks before . And where has Avril been since then ? Sall. asked herself . Watching while Kenjo flew the Mariposa ? That won certainly set Avril Bitra to thinking hard . Well , Sallah was due on her shift soon anyway , and as luck won have it , the sled she was servicing was on the grid . She would have clear view of the Mariposa and those who approached it . If Avril can anywhere near , Sallah would set up an alarm . There had been no talk of Kenjo making another attempt to dr Thread in the atmosphere . Then , too , Kenjo 's flights were usual ' plotted for the dawn window , and Sallah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened rather quickly . Sallah was walking toward the sled she was servicing as Ongola and Kenjo , suited for space travel , Ir11 the tower with Ezra Keroon , Dieter Clissmann , and two other ove  --  e ailed figures whom Sallah was astonished to recognize by their p ( ) . tures as Paul and Emily . Ongola and Kenjo had the appearance ( 4 men listening to last-minute instructions . Then they continued ( ) 11p203almost at a stroll , toward the Mariposa , while the others turned back into the met tower . Suddenly another suited figure began to walk across the grid on a path that would intercept Ongola and Kenjo . Even in the baggy space gear the figure walked as only Avril did ! Sallah grabbed the nearest big spanner and started at a jog-trot across the grid . Ongola and Kenjo disappeared behind the pile of discarded sled parts at the edge of the field . Avril had begun to run , and Sallah increased her own pace . She lost sight of Ongola and Kenjo . Then she saw Arvil pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . Rounding the pile , Sallah saw both Kenjo and Ongola flat on the ground . Blood covered the back of Kenjo 's head and Ongola 's shoulderand neck . Sallah ran flat out , ducking down to keep scrap heaps between her and the Mariposa . As it was , she just made it as the airlock was closing . She threw herself inside and felt something scrape her left foot ; there was an immense hissing , and then she blacked out.  |p204Mairi  Hanrahan thought it odd that Sallah had not rung at lunch time to tell her she was delayed . With so many small ones to feed , every mother tried to be there at mealtimes . Mairi got one of hey older children to feed Cara instead , thinking that something verN important must have demanded Sallah 's attention . None of the people at the met tower or admin building expected any contact from Ongola or Kenjo while the shuttle was moving through the ionized atmosphere . Ezra , seated at the desk of the voiceactivatedinterface , could follow its course via the activated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing fast and soon reached the docking port . " Safely there , " Ezra announced when he rang through to both tower and administration . Half an hour later , children playing at the edge of the grid came screaming back to their teacher about the dead men . Actually . Ongola was still barely alive . Paul met the medic team at the infirmary . " He 'll live , but he 's lost more blood than I like , " the doctor told the admiral . " What ' n hell happened to him and Kenjo ? " " How was Kenjo killed ? " Paul asked . " The old blunt instrument . The paras found a bloodied strut nearby . Probably that . Kenjo never knew what hit him . " Paul was not sure he did either , for his legs suddenly would not support him . The doctor beckoned fiercely for one of the paras to help the admiral to a seat and poured a glass of quikal . Paul tried to dismiss the eager hands . The implications of the two deaths greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss , though the wretched quikal eased the intense shock that had rocked him . In the back of his mind , as he knocked back the drink , he wondered where Kenjo had cached the rest of the fuel . Why , Paul seethed at himself , had he not asked the man before ? He could have done so any time before or after the last few flights Kenjo had taken ii the Mariposa . As admiral , he knew exactly how much fuel had been left in the gig on its last drop . Now it was too late ! Unless Ongola knew . He had mentioned to Paul that there was not much left at thep205original site , but that Kenjo had been supplying the Mariposa . The figures Sallah had initially reported to Ongola indicated a lot more fuel than Paul had seen in that cave the other night . Well , the misappropriation  --  yes , that was the right term  --  had had a final appropriateusage . Maybe Kenjo 's wife knew where he had stored the remainder . Paul consoled himself with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fuel sacks at the Honshu stake . He forced himself to deal with present issues : a man had been murdered and another lay close to death on a planet that had , until that moment , witnessed no capital crime . " Ongola will survive , " the doctor was saying , pouring Paul a secondshot . " He 's got a splendid constitution , and we 'll work any miraclerequired . We could probably have saved Kenjo if we 'd got there earlier . Brain-dead . Drink this  --  your color 's lousy . " Paul finished the quikal and put the glass down with a decisive movement . He took a deep breath and rose to his feet . " I 'm fine , thanks . Get on with saving Ongola . We 'll need to know what happened when he recovers consciousness . Keep the rumors down , people ! " he added , addressing the others in the room . He strode out of the emergency facility and turned immediately for the building that housed the interface chamber and Ezra . As he walked , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen the Mariposa take off . Who had flown her ? He stopped off to collect Emily from her office , briefing her on the calamity . Ezra was surprised by the arrival of both admiral and governor ; the Mariposa ' s current flight was being treated as routine . " Kenjo 's dead and Ongola seriously injured , Ezra , " Paul said as soon as he had closed and locked the door behind them . " So , who 's Hying the Mariposa ? " " Gods in the heavens ! " Ezra leapt to his feet and pointed to the monitor , which clearly showed the safely docked Mariposa . " The flight was precalculated to hit the right window , but the docking process was left to the pilot . It was very smoothly done . Not everyone can do that . " " I 'll run a check on the whereabouts of pilots , Paul , " Emily said , picking up a handset . Paul glared at the monitor . " I do n't think we need to do that . Call  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed his hand across his face . " Who 's at the met tower ? " " Jake Chernoff and Dieter Clissmann , " Emily reported . " Then ask Jake if there 's any unmodified sleds on the grid . Find outp206exactly where Stev Kimmer , Nabol Nahbi , and Bart Lemos are And  --  " Paul held up a warning hand . "  --  if anyone 's seen Avril Bitra anywhere . " " Avril ? " Ezra echoed , and then clamped his mouth firmly shut . Suddenly Paul swore in a torrent of abusive language that made even Ezra regard him with amazement , and slammed out of the room Emily concentrated on finding the pilots and had completed het check before Paul returned . He leaned back against the closed door catching his breath . " Stev , Nabhi , and Lemos are accounted for . Where did you go ? " Emily asked . " To check Ongola 's space suit . Doc says he 'll recover from his injuries . The strut just missed severing the shoulder muscle and leaving him a cripple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger and thumb . " No one is going to get very far in the Manposa . " He nodded grimly as Ezra realized what the admiral was holding . " One of the more essential parts of the guidance system ! Ongola had not yet put it in place . " " Then how did  --  Avril ? " Emily asked , pausing for confirmation . Paul nodded slowly . " Yes , it has to be Avril , does n't it ? But why would she want to get to the Yoko ? " " First step to leaving the system , Emily . We 've been stupidly lax . Yes , I know we have this , " he acknowledged when Emily pointed to the chip panel . " But we should n't have allowed her to get that far in the first place . And we all knew what she was like . Sallah warned us , and the years . . . " And recent unusual events , " Ezra put in , mildly hinting that Paul need not excoriate himself . " We should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuel in her . " " We also ought to have had the sense to ask Kenjo where he was getting all the fuel , " Ezra added . " We knew that , " Emily said with a wry grin . " You did ? " Ezra was amazed . " At least Ongola took no chances , " Paul went on , wincing as he remembered the sight of the man 's battered shoulder and neck . " This  --  " He put the guidance chip very carefully down on the shell above the worktop. "  --  was Ongola 's special precaution , done with Kenjo 's complete concurrence . " Emily sat down heavily in the nearest chair . " So where does that leave us now ? "  | " The next move would appear to be Avril 's . " Ezra shook his head sadly . " She 's got more than enough fuel to get back down . " " That is not her intention , " Paul said . " Unfortunately , " Emily said , " she has a hostage , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing . " Sallah returned to consciousness aware of severe discomfort and a throbbing pain in her left foot . She was bound tightly and efficiently in an uncomfortable position , her hands behind her back and secured to her tied feet . She was floating with her side just brushing the floor of the spacecraft ; the lack of gravity told her that she was no longer on Perri . There was a rhythmic but unpleasant background noise , along with the sounds of things clattering and slipping about . Then she recognized the monotonous and vicious sounds to be the curses of Avril Bitra . " What in hell did you do to the guidance systems , Telgar ? " she asked , kicking at the bound woman 's ribs . The kick lifted Sallah off the floor , and she found herself floating within inches of the face of an enraged Avril Bitra . Probably the only reason Sallah was still breathing was because the cabin of the Mariposahad its own oxygen supply . Kenjo would have charged the tanks up to full , would n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to float beyond Avril . The other woman was suited ; the helmet sat on the rack above the pilot 's seat , ready for use . Avril reached up and grabbed Sallah 's arm . " What do you know about this ? Tell me and be quick about it , or I 'll evacuate you and save the air for me to breathe ! " Sallah had no doubt that the woman was capable of doing just that . " I know nothing about anything , Avril . I saw you stalking Ongola and Kenjo and knew you were up to something . So I followed you and got in the airlock just as you took off . " " You followed me ? " Avril lashed out with a fist . The impact caused both women to bounce apart . Avril steadied herself on a handhold . " How dare you ? " " Well , as I had n't seen you in months and longed to know how you were faring , it seemed a good idea at the time . " Hang for the fleece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not shrug her shoulders . What had she done to her foot ? It was an aching mess . " Bloody hell . You 've flown this frigging crate . How do I override the preflight instructions ? You must know that . " " I might if you 'd let me see the console . " She saw hope , and then manic doubt , in Avril 's eyes . Sallah was not lying . " How could Ip208possibly tell from over here ? I do n't know where we are . I 've been just another Thread sledder . " Even to a woman slightly paranoid , the truth would be obvious . Sallah warned herself to be very careful " Just let me look . " She did not ask to be untied although that was what she desperately wanted  --  needed . Her right shoulder must have been bruised by het fall into the cabin , and all the muscles were spasming . " Do n't think I 'll untie you , " Avril warned , and contemptuously she pushed Sallah across the cabin . Grabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful halt against the command console . " Look ! " Sallah did , though hanging slightly upside down was not the best position for the job . She had to think carefully , for Avril had piloted shuttles and knew something of their systems . But the Mariposa , though small , was designed to traverse interplanetary distances , dock with a variety of stations or other craft , and had the sophisticated controls to perform a considerable variety of maneuvers in space and on a planetary surface . Sallah dared to hope that much of its instrumentationwould be unfamiliar to Avril . " To find out what this ship just did , " she instructed , " hit the return button on the bottom tier of the greens . No , the port side . " Avril jerked at Sallah , tweaking strained arm and back muscles and jamming Sallah 's head against the viewscope . Sallah 's long hair was freed completely from its pins and flowed over her face . " Do n't get cute ! " Avril snapped , her finger hovering on the appropriatebutton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Avril punched the button with one hand and hauled her back into position with the other . Then she caught the handhold to keep herself in place . Every action has a reaction , Sallah thought , trying to clear her head of pain and confusion . The monitor came up with a preflight instruction plan . " The Mariposa was programmed to dock here on the Yoko . " It was nice to know where she was , Sallah reflected . " Once you hit the power , you could n't alter its course . " " Well , " Avril said , her tone altering considerably . " I wanted to come here first anyhow . I just wanted to come on my own . " Sallah , hair falling over her face , felt a lessening of the tension that emanated from the woman . Some of the beauty returned to a face no longer contorted with frustration . " I do n't need you hanging about , then . " Avril reached up and gave Sallah 's body a calculated shove that sent her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the other wall and then hover there . " Well , I 'll just get to work . "  |p209How  long Sallah was suspended in that fashion she did not know . She managed to tilt her head and get her hair to float away from her eyes , but she did not dare to move much  --  action produced reaction , and she did not wish to draw attention to herself . She ached all over , but the pain in her foot was almost unbearable . A tirade of malevolent and resentful oaths spun from Avril 's lips . " None of the programs run , of all the frigging luck . Nothing runs ! " Sallah had just enough time to duck her head to avoid Avril 's projectile arrival against her . As it was , she went head over heels in a spin that Avril , laughing gleefully , assisted until the rotation made Sallah retch . " You bitch woman ! " Avril stopped Sallah before she could expel more vomit into the air . " Okay ! If that 's the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 're going to tell me , or I 'll kill you by inches . " A spaceman 's knife , with its many handle-packed implements , sliced across the top of Sallah 's nose . Then she felt the blade none too gently cutting the bindings on her hands and feet . Blood rushed through starved arteries , and her strained muscles reacted painfully . If she had not been in free-fall , she would have collapsed . As it was , the agony of release made her sob and shake . " Clean up your spew first , " Avril said , shoving a slop jar at her . Sallah did as she was told , grateful for the lack of gravity , grateful for the release , and wondering what she could do to gain an upper hand . But she had little opportunity to enjoy her freedom , for Avril had other ways of securing her prisoner 's cooperation . Before Sallah realized what was happening , Avril had secured a tether to the injured foot and tweaked the line . Pain , piercing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her groin . There was too little left in her stomach to throw up . Avril jerked Sallah over to the console , pushed her into the pilot 's chair , and tied her down , twitching her improvised lead line to remind Sallah of her helplessness . " Now , check the fuel on board , check the quantity in the Yoko 's tanks  --  I 've done that , I know the answers , so do n't try anything clever . " A jerk against Sallah 's injured foot reinforced the threat . " Then enter a program that gets me out of this wretched asshole of a midden system . " Sallah did as she was told , though her head ached and her eyes blurred repeatedly . She could not suppress her surprise at the amount of fuel in the Mariposa 's tanks.  | " Yes , someone was holding back on it . You ? " There was a jerk on the line . " Kenjo , I suspect , " Sallah replied coolly , managing to suppress a cry . She was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes , that computes . I thought he 'd given up all to() tamely ! Where did he hide it ? " The line tightened . Sallah had to bite hard on her lip against a sob . " Probably at his stake . It 's back of beyond . No one goes there . He could hide anything there . " Avril snorted and remained silent . Sallah made herself breathe deeply , forcing more adrenaline into her system to combat pain , fatigue , and fear . " All right , compute me a course to . . . " Avril consulted a note book . " Here . " Only because Sallah already knew the coordinates did she recognize the numbers . Avril wished to go to the system nearest them , a system that , though uninhabited , was closer to the populated sectors of space . The course would stretch the Mariposa to the end of availablefuel , even if Avril also drained the Yoko 's tanks . It gave Sallah no consolation to think that the little ship might drift for centuries with Avril safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ongola had tampered with the sleep tanks , too . She liked that idea . But she knew Ongola too well to presume that kind of foresight . Unfortunately , the Avrils of the galaxy could make themselves at home in any time and culture . So if Avril went into deep sleep . eventually someone , or something , would rescue her and the Mariposa . Sallah did not need to see them to know that Avril had several fortunes ' worth of gemstones and precious metals aboard the Mariposa . There had never been any doubt in anyone 's mind why Avril had chosen Big Island as her stake , but no one had cared . But then , no one would have imagined that she would be mad enough to attempt to leave Pern , even with Threadfall threatening the planet . Wondering why Avril , who was an astrogator , after all , had not been able to complete laying in such a simple course , Sallah did as she was ordered . She had more experience than Avril did with the Mariposa'sdrive board . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57465534511 was the message . Avril jerked hard on the line , and Sallah hissed against the burning . crippling pain in her foot . " Try again . There 's more than one way of entering a course . " Sallah obeyed . " I 'll have to go around the existing parameters . " " Reset the entire effing thing but plot that course , " Avril told her.  |p211As  Sallah began the more laborious deviation into the commandcenter of the gig 's course computer , she was aware that Avril had picked up a long narrow cylinder from the rack by her helmet . She fiddled with it , humming tunelessly under her breath , seemingly thoroughly delighted with herself . When Sallah finally tapped the " return " tab , she became aware of Avril 's intense interest in the flickering console . She chanced a look at what the woman had been fondling . It was a homemade capsule . Not a homer  --  they were thicker and longer  --  but something more like the standard beacon . Suddenly she clearly saw Avril 's plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rukbat system as possible and then direct the distress beacon toward shipping lanes . Every planetary system involved with the Federated Sentient Planets , and some life-forms who were not , traced distress beacons to origin . The devices , automatically released when a ship was destroyed , were often traced by those who wished to turn whatever profit they could on the flotsam . Avril 's plan was not as insane as it seemed . Sallah felt certain that Stev Kimmer had intended to take the trip with her , to be rescued by the distress beacon he had made for her . Words flashed on the screen . NO ACCESS WITHOUT STANDARD FCP/ " Fuck it ! That 's all I could get out of it . Try again , Telgar . " Avril pressed Sallah 's foot against the base of the console module , increasingthe pain to the point where Sallah felt herself losing consciousness . Avril viciously pinched her left breast . " You do n't pass out on me , Telgar ! " " Look , " Sallah said , her voice rather more shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've tried . I 've tried the fail-safe I was taught . Someone anticipated you , Bitra . Open up this panel and I 'll tell you if we 've been wasting effort . " She was trembling not only with pain but with the effort not to relieve her bladder . But she did not dare to ask even that favor . Swearing , her face livid with frustration and rage , Avril deftly removed the panel , kicking the console in her frenzy . Sallah leaned as far away as her bonds permitted , hoping to escape any stray blows . " How did they do it ? What did they take , Telgar , or I 'll start carving you up . " Avril flattened Sallah 's left hand over the exposed chips , and her knife blade cut through the little finger to the bone . Pain and shock lanced through Sallah 's body . " You do n't need this one at all ! " " Blood hangs in the air just like vomit and urine , Bitra . And if you do n't stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes in a contest of wills . " What . . . did . . . they . . . remove ? " With each word Avril sawed against the little finger . Sallah screamed . It felt good to scream , and she knew that it would complete the picture of her in Avril 's mind : soft . Sallah had never felt harder in her life . " Guidance . They removed the guidance chip . You ca n't go any where . " The blade left her finger , and Sallah stared in fascination at the drops of blood that formed and floated . The contemplation took het mind off Avril 's ranting until the woman snagged her shoulder . " Are all the spare parts on the planet ? Did they strip everything from the Yoko ? " Sallah forced her attention away from the blood and the pain , clamping down on all but the important consideration : how to thwart Avril without seeming to . " I 'd say that there would be guidance chips left in the main board that could be substituted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife through the cord that bound Sallah to the pilot 's seat . " Okay . We suit up and head for the bridge . " " Not before I go to the head , Avril , " Sallah replied . She nodded at her hand . " And attend to this . You do n't want blood on the chips , you know . " She let herself scream with the pain of the jerk to her foot . She felt she had handled her submission well . Avril would have suspected a more immediate capitulation . " And another boot . " Finally Sallah could spare a dispassionate look at her foot . Half her heel was missing , and a puddle of blood rocked slowly back and forth , moved by the agitation of Avril 's kicks . " Wait ! " Avril had also noticed the blood . She spun away to the lockers by the hatch and came back with a space suit and a dirty cloth . " There ! Strip ! " Sallah tied up her finger with the least soiled strip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It hurt badly , and she could feel that fragments of her work boot had been jammed into the flesh . She was allowed the use of the head , while Avril watched and made snide cracks about maternal changes in a woman 's body . Sallah pretended to be more humiliated than shy , actually felt . It made Avril feel so superior . The higher the summit , the harder the fall , Sallah thought grimly . She struggled into the space suit . " She 's left the gig , Admiral , " Ezra said suddenly into the tense silence in the crowded interface chamber . Tarvi had been called in . Silent tears streamed down his face . " She 's passed the sensors at thep213docking area . No , " he corrected himself , " two bodies have passed the sensors . " Tarvi let out a ragged sob but said nothing . Bit by bit , the pieces had been put together to solve the puzzle of Sallah 's disappearance and Avril Bitra 's reappearance . A technician , working on a remount job on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her task and wander toward the scrap pile at the edge of the grid . He had also noticed Kenjo and Ongola walking to the Mariposa . He had not seen anyone else in that vicinity . Shortly afterward he had seen the Mariposa lift off . Once someone thought to look for it , the sled Avril had used was easily spotted . It carried none of the modifications that all other Pernese sleds bore ; it had been left at the edge of the grid , among others that had been called in for servicing . Stev Kimmer was called in to identify it . She had removed every trace of her occupancy , although Stev pointed to scrape marks that were new to him . He also kept his personal comments about his erstwhile partner to himself , though his expression had been sufficiently grim for Paul and Emily to suspect that he had been double-crossed . For one moment he had hesitated . Then , with a shrug , he had answered every question they asked him . " She wo n't get anywhere , " Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wo n't . " Paul looked at the guidance cartridge , not daring to glance in Tarvi 's direction . " Could n't she replace it from similar chips on the bridge ? " Tarvi asked , his face an odd shade , his lips dry , and his liquid eyes tormented . " Not the right size , " Ezra said , his expression infinitely sad . " The Mariposa was more modern , used smaller , more sophisticated crys-tals . " " Besides , " Paul added heavily , " the chip she really needs is the one Ongola replaced with a blank . Oh , she can probably set a course and it will appear to be accepted . The ship will reverse out of the dock , but the moment she touches the firing pin , it 'll just go straight ahead . " " But Sallah ! " Tarvi demanded in an anguished voice . " What will happen to my wife ? " Sallah waited until Avril had reversed the Mariposa from the dock , let it drift away from the Yokohama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated the comm unit . Avril had done as much damage to the circuitry in the bridge console as she could , but shep214had forgotten the override at the admiral 's position . As soon as she left the bridge , Sallah accessed it . " Yokohama to Landing . Come in , Ezra . You must be there ! " " Keroon here , Telgar ! What 's your position ? " " Sitting , " Sallah said . " Goddamn it , Telgar , do n't be facetious at a time like this , " Ezra cried . " Sorry , sir , " Sallah said . " I do n't have visuals . " That was a lie , but she did not wish anyone to see her condition . " I 'm accessing the probe garage . There is no damage report for that area . You 've three probes left . How I shall program them ? " " Hellfire , girl , do n't talk about probes now ! How 're we going to get you down ? " " I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarvi ? " " Sal-lah ! " The two syllables were said in a tone that brought her heart to her mouth and tears to her eyes . Why had he never spoken her name that way before ? Did it mean the long-awaited avowal of his love ? The anguish in his voice evoked a spirit tortured and distressed . " Tarvi , my love . " She kept her voice level though her throat kept closing . " Tarvi , who 's with you there ? " " Paul , Emily , Ezra , " he replied in broken tones . " Sallah ! You must return ! " " On the wings of a prayer ? No . Go to Cara ! Get out of the room . I 've got some business to do , Pern business . Paul , make him leave . I ca n't think if I know he 's listening . " " Sallah ! " Her name echoed and reechoed in her ears . " Okay , Ezra , tell me where you want them . " There was a choking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of the cometary , the second to circumnavigate . " Ezra cleared his throat again . " I want the other to follow the spiral curve of that nebulosity . If the big scope is operable , I 'd like bridge readings all along that damned thing . We ca n't track it with the telescope we have here  --  not powerful enough for the definition we need . Never thought we 'd need the big one , so we did n't dismantle it . " He was maundering , Sallah thought affectionately , to get himself under control . Did she hear someone crying through that conversation ? Surely Governor Boll or the admiral would have been kind enough to get Tarvi out of the room . Then she needed to concentrate on the information Ezra was givingher to encode the duties and destinations of the individual probes.  | " Probes away , sir , " she said , remembering the last time she had given that response . She saw Peru on the big screen ; she had never thought that she would again see from space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now I 'm sending some data for Dieter to decipher . Avril said she 'd killed both Ongola and Kenjo . Has she ? " " Kenjo , yes . Ongola will pull through . " " Old soldiers do n't die easy . Look , Ezra , what I 'm sending for Dieter are some notations I made on available fuel . Ongola will know what I mean . And I 've sent down Avril 's course . She went off in the right direction , but I saw a very odd-looking crystal in that guidance system , one I never saw on the Mariposa when I was driving her . Am I right ? She wo n't go anywhere ? " " Once Bitra hits the engine button , she goes in a straight line . " " Very good , " Sallah said with a feeling of immense satisfaction . " The straight and narrow for our dear departed friend . Now , I 'm activating the big scope . I 'll program it to report through the interfaceto you . All right ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra ordered gruffly . " I do n't think so , Captain , " she said , glad to rely on the impersonal address . She visualized Ezra Keroon 's thin frame hunched over the interface . " I do n't have that much time . Only the oxygen in my tanks . They were full when Avril let me put them on , but she told me she was switching off the bridge 's independent system . I have no reason to doubt her . That 's another reason why I 'm switching the scope 's readingsto you . Space gloves are good , but they do n't allow for fine tunings . I just about managed some repairs to the mess Avril made of the console . Jury rig at least , so . . . when someone gets a chance to get up here , most everything will work . " " How much time do you have , Sallah ? " " I do n't know . " She could feel the blood reaching to her calf in the big boot , and her left glove was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt weak , too , and she was aware that it was getting harder to breathe . It was all of a piece . She would miss knowing Cara better . " Sallah ? " Ezra 's voice was very kind . " Sallah , talk to Tarvi . We ca n't keep him out of here . He 's like a madman . He just wants to talk to you . " Oh , sure , fine . I want to talk to him , " she said , her voice sounding funny even to herself . " Sallah ! " Tarvi had managed to get his voice under control . " Get out of here , all of you ! She 's mine now . Sallah , jewel in my night , myp216golden girl , my emerald-eyed rance , why did I never tell you before how much you mean to me ? I was too proud . I was too vain . But you taught me to love , taught me by your sacrifice when I was too engrossed in my other love  --  my worklove  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could I have been so stupid ? How could I have failed to see that you were more than just a body to receive my seed , more than an ear to hear my ambitions , more than hands to  --  Sallah ! Sallah ? Answer me , Sallah ! " " You  --  loved  --  me ? " " I do love you , Sallah . I do ! Sallah ? Sallah ! Salllllaaaaah ! " " What do you think , Dieter ? " Paul asked the programmer as heconsulted the figures Ezra had given them . " Well , this first lot of figures gives us over two thousand liters of fuel . The second is a guesstimate of how much Kenjo used on the four missions he flew and what was used by the Mariposa today . There 's a substantial quantity unused somewhere down here on the surface . The third set is evidently what was left in the Yoko 's tanks and is now in the Mariposa 's . But , I do point out , as Sallah does , that there 's enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrections . " Paul nodded brusquely . " Go on . " " Now this section is the course Bitra tried to set . The first course correction should have been initiated about now . " Dieter frowned at the equations on his monitor . " In fact , she should be plunging straight toward our eccentric planet . Maybe we 'll find out sooner than we knew what the surface is like . " " Not that Avril is likely to stand by and give us any useful information as  --  as Sallah did . " Dieter looked up at the savage tone of the admiral 's voice . " Sorry . G'mon . You 've the right . And if something goes wrong . . . " Paul left the sentence dangling as he led Dieter down the corridor to the interface room . Emily had gone with Tarvi to give him what comfort she could , so Ezra was manning the room alone . He looked as old as Paul felt after the wringing emotions of the day . " Any word ? " " None of it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's just discovered that the first course correction has n't occurred . " He turned the dial so that the low snarl of vindictive curses was plainly audible.  |p217Paul  grinned maliciously at Dieter . " So you said . " He turned on the speakers . " Avril , can you hear me ? " " Benden ! What the hell did that bitch of yours do ? How did she do it ? The override is locked . I ca n't even maneuver . I knew I should have sawn her foot off . " Ezra blanched and Dieter looked ill , but Paul 's smile was vindictive . So Avril had underestimated Sallah . He took a deep breath of pride in the valiant woman . " You 're going to explore the plutonic planet , Avril darling . Why do n't you be a decent thing and give us a running account ? " " Shove it , Benden . You know where ! You 'll get nothing out of me . Oh , shit ! Oh , shit ! it 's not the  --  oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drowned by a sizzling roar that made Ezra grab for the volume dial . " Shit ! " Paul echoed very softly . " It 's not the . . . '  --  the what ? Damn you , Avril , to eternity ! It 's not the what ? " Emily and Pierre , along with Chio-Chio Yoritomo , who had been Kenjo 's wife 's cabinmate on the Buenos Aires and her housemate on Irish Square , took the fast sled to Kenjo 's Honshu Stake . While most of Landing knew about Kenjo 's death and Ongola 's serious illness , there had been no public announcement . Rumor had been busy discussing the " unknown " assailant . When Emily returned that night , she brought a sealed message to the admiral . " She told us , " Emily said dryly , " that she would prefer to stay on at Honshu to work the stake herself for her four children . She has few needs and would not trouble us . " " She is very traditional , " Chio-Chio told the admiral breathlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belittles the dead . " She shrugged , eyes down , her hands clenching and unclenching . Then she looked up , almost defiant in her anger . " She was like that . Kenjo married her because she would not question what he did . He asked me first , but I had more sense , even if he was a war ace . Oh ! " She brought her arm up to hide her face . " But to die like that ! Struck from behind . An ignominious death for one who had cheated it so often ! " Then she turned and fled from the room , her sobbing audible as she ran out into the night . Emily gestured for Paul to open the small note , which was well . sealed by wax and stamped with some kind of marking . He broke itp218open and unfolded the thick , beautiful , handmade paper . Then , mys tified , he handed it to Emily and Pierre . " There were two caves cut , to judge by the amount of fuel used and rubble spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where the other was , ' " Emily read . " So he did manage to remove some of the fuel ? How much ? " " We 'll see if Ezra can figure it out  --  or Ongola , when he recovers . Pierre ? " Paul asked the chef for a pledge of silence . " Of course . Discretion was bred in my family for generations . Admiral . " " Paul , " the admiral corrected him . " For something like this , old friend , you are the admiral ! " Pierre clicked his heels together and inclined his body slightly from the waist , smiling with a brief reassurance . " Emily , you are tired . You should rest now . Paul , tell her ! " Paul laid one hand on Pierre de Courci 's shoulder and took Emily 's arm with the other . " There is one more duty for the day , Pierre , and you 'd best be with us . " " The bonfire ! " Emily pulled back against Paul 's arm . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in when she faltered . " Tarvi has asked it . " All three walked with reluctant steps , joining the trickle of others going in the same direction , down to the dark Bonfire Square . Each house had left one light burning . The thinly scattered stars were brilliant , and the first moon , Timor , was barely a crescent on the eastern skyline . By the pyramid of thicket and fern , Tarvi stood , his head down , a man as gaunt as some of the branches that had been cast into the pile . Suddenly , as if he knew that all were there who would come , he lit the brand . It flared up to light a face haggard with grief , with hair that straggled across tear-wet cheeks . Tarvi raised the brand high , turning slowly as if to place firmly in his memory the faces of all those in attendence . " From now on , " he shouted harsely , " I am not Tarvi , nor Andiyar . I am Telgar , so that her name is spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone for giving us her life today . Our children will now bear that name , too . Ram Telgar , Ben Telgar , Dena Telgar , and Cara Telgar , who will never know her mother . " He took a deep breath , filling his chest . " What is my name ? " " Telgar ! " Paul replied as loud as he could . " Telgar ! " cried Emily beside him , Pierre 's baritone repeating it a breath behind her . " Telgar ! "  | " Telgar ! Telgar ! Telgar ! Telgar ! Telgar ! " Nearly three thousand voices took up the shout in a chant , pumping their arms until Telgar thrust the burning torch into the bonfire . As the flame roared up through the dry wood and fern , the name crescendoed . " Telgar ! Telgar ! Telgar ! "  |p220The  shock of Sallah Telgar 's death reverberated across the conti nent . She had been well known , both as shuttle pilot during debarka tion and as an able manager of the Karachi camp . Her courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as if , because Sallah had been willing to devote the last moments of her life to benefit the colony , everyone had to strive harder to vindicate her sacrifice . Or so it seemed for the next eight days until some disturbingrumors began to circulate . " Look , Paul , " Joel Lilienkamp began even before he had closed the door behind him . " Everyone 's got a right to access Stores . But that Ted Tubberman 's been taking out some unusual stuff for a botanist . " " Not Tubberman again , " Paul said , leaning back in his chair with it deep sigh of disgust . Tarv  --  Telgar , Paul corrected himself , had phoned the previous day , asking if Tubberman had been authorized to scrounge in the shuttle they were dismantling . " Yes , " Joel said . " If you ask me , he 's only accessing half his chips . You 've got enough on your plate , Paul , but you got ta know what that fool 's doing . I 'll bet my last bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Wind Blossom 's request , Pol has denied him further access to the biology labs , " Paul said wearily . " Seems he was acting as if he was in charge of bioengineering . Bay does n't like him much , either . " " She 's not alone , " Joel replied , lowering himself to a chair and scrubbing at his face . " I want your permission to shut the shop door in his face , too . I caught him in Building G , which houses the technicallysensitive stuff . I do n't want anyone in there without my authorization . And there he was , bald-faced and swaggering like he had every right , he and Bart Lemos . " " Bart Lemos ! " Paul sat up again . " Yeah . He , Bart , and Stev Kimmer 're doing a good-old-buddy bit these days . And I do n't like the rumors my sources tell me they 're spreading . " " Stev Kimmer 's in on it ? " Paul was surprised . Joel shrugged . " He 's mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . Bart Lemos was a gulliblyp221nonentity , but Stev Kimmer was a highly skilled technician . Paul had put a discreet monitor on the man 's activities after Avril 's departure . Siev had gone on a three-day bender and been found asleep in the dismantled shuttle . Once he had recovered from the effects of quikal , he had gone back to work . Fulmar said that other mechanics did not like pairing with him because he was taciturn , if not downright surly . ' he thought of Tubberman having access to Kimmer 's expertise made Paul uneasy . " What exactly have you heard , Lili ? " he asked . " A load of crap , " the little storesman said , folding his fingers across his chest . " I do n't think anyone with any sense buys the notion ilhat Avril and Kenjo were in league . Or that Ongola killed Kenjo to keep them from taking the Mariposa to go for help . But I 'll warn you , Paul , if Kitti 's bioengineering program does n't show positive results , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Emily are going to he asked to reconsider sending off that homing capsule . " The previous evening , Paul had discussed that expedient with Emily , Ezra , and Jim . Keroon had been the fiercest opponent of a homing-capsuleMayday , which he termed an exercise in futility . As Paul remarked , such technological help was , at the earliest , ten years away . And the chance that the FSP would move with any speed to assist them was depressingly slim . To send for help seemed not only a rejection of Sallah 's sacrifice but a cowardly admission of failure when hey had not exhausted the ingenuity and resourcefulness of their community . " What sort of material has Ted been requisitioning , Lili ? " Paul asked . Joel extracted a wad of paper from his thigh pocket and made a show of unfolding and reading from it . " Grab bag from hydroponics insulation materials , steel mesh and posts , and some computer chips that Dieter says he could n't possibly need , use , or understand . " Did you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I happened to just do that very thing . A bit arrogant he was , too . Said they were needed for his experiments " Joel was clearly dubiousabout their value  --  " to develop a more effective defense against the Thread until help comes . " Paul grimaced . He had heard the botanist 's wild claims that he , not the biologists and their jumped-up mutated lizards , would protect I'ern . " I do n't like that till help comes ' bit , " Paul murmured , gritting his teeth . " So , tell me to lock him out , Paul . He may be a charterer , but he 's overspent his credit and then some . " He waved the sheet . " I got records to prove that . "  |p222Paul  nodded . " Yes , but next time he presents a list , get him to t you what he wants , then shut the door . I want to know what he 's to. , , " Restrict him to his stake , " Joel said , rising to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , " and you 'll save all of us lot of aggro . He 's a wild card , and you ca n't be sure where he bounce up next . " Paul grinned at the storesman . " I 'd be glad to , Lili , but the m date does n't permit that kind of action . " Joel snorted derisively , hesitated a moment longer , and th shrugging in his inimitable fashion , left the office . Paul did not forget the conversation , but the morning brou more pressing concerns . Despite the best efforts of Fulmar and engineering crews , three more sleds had failed airworthiness tes That meant using more ground crews , the last line of defense and t most enervating for people already worked to the point of exha tion . Neither Paul nor Emily recognized the significance of th separate reports : one from the veterinary lab , saying that their sup rooms had been rifled overnight ; another from Pol Nietro , reporti that Ted Tubberman had been seen in bioengineering ; and the thi from Fulmar , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders from the dismantled shuttle . When Joel Lilienkamp 's angry call came through , Paul had lit trouble arriving at a conclusion . " May his orifices congeal and his extremities fall off , " Joel cried the top of his voice . " He 's got the homing capsule ! " Shock jolted Paul out of his chair , while Emily and Ezra regard him in astonishment . " Are you sure ? " " Of course I 'm sure , Paul . I hid the carton in among stove pi and heating units . It has n't been misplaced , but who the hell co know that carton #45/879 was a homing capsule ? " " Tubberman took it ? " " I 'll bet my last bottle of brandy he did . " Joel spoke so fast that words slurred . " The fucker ! The crap-eater , the slime-product maggot ! " " When did you discover it gone ? " " Now ! I 'm calling from Building G. I check it out at least once day . " " Gould Tubberman have followed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I am ? " Joel was as apoplectic such a suggestion as he was about the theft . " I check every buildi every day and I can tell you exactly what was requisitioned yesterdp223and the day before , so I fucking well know when something 's miss-ing ! " " I do n't doubt you for a moment , Joel . " Paul rubbed his hand hard over his mouth , thinking rapidly . Then he saw the anxious expressions of Emily and Ezra . " Hold on , " he said into the handset , and reported what Joel had said . " Well , " Ezra replied , a look of intense relief passing over his gaunt features . " Tubberman could n't launch a kite . He can barely maneuvera sled . I would n't worry about him . " " Not him . But I worry a lot about Stev Kimmer and Bart Lemos being seen in Tubberman 's company lately , " Paul said quietly . Ezra seemed to deflate , burying his head in his hands . " Ted Tubberman has had it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying onto the table in a precise manner and rising to her feet . " I do n't give a spent chip for his position as a charterer or the privacy of his stake . We 're searching Calusa . " She gave Ezra a poke in the shoulder . " C'm on , you 'll know what components he 'd need . " They all heard the sound of running feet , then the door burst in and Jake Chernoff erupted into the office . " Sir , sorry , sir , " the young man cried , his face flushed , his chest heaving from exertion . " Your phone  --  " He pointed excitedly at the receiver in the admiral 's hand . " Too important . Scanners at met  --  something blasted off from Oslo Landing , three minutes ago  --  and it was n't a sled . Too small . " As one , Paul , Emily , and Ezra made for the door and ran to the interface chamber . Ezra fumbled at the terminal in his haste to implementthe program . An exhaust trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath , Ezra switched to the Yoko 's monitor , which was tracking the blip . For a long moment they watched , rigid with fury and frustration . Then Ezra straightened his long frame , his hands hanging limply . " Well , what 's done 's done . " " Not completely , " Emily said , her voice harsh as she separated each syllable in a curious lilt . She turned to Paul , her eyes very bright , her lips pursed , and her expression implacable . " Oslo Landing , hmmm ? That capsule was just launched . Let 's go get the buggers . " Leaving Ezra to monitor the capsule 's ascent , Paul and Emily left at a run . The first three big men they encountered on their way to the grid were commandeered to assist . Paul spotted Fulmar and told him to pilot Kenjo 's augmented sled . " Do n't ask questions , Fulmar , " Paul said , peremptorily seconding two more burly technicians . " Just head us toward Jordan , and **27;15720;TOOLONG waters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they was n't above mocking the Prophet and saying , " We came to see you make your eye whole . " The Prophet looked at them with his one good eye , and he said , " With this eye I see two Red men , weak and sick , slaves of likker , the kind of men who would mock me with the words of the man who killed my father . " Then he closed his good eye , and he said , " With this eye I see two children of the land , whole and strong and beautiful , who love wives and children , and do good to all creatures . " Then he opened his eye again and said , " Which eye is sick , and which eye sees true ? " And they said to him , " Tenskwa-Tawa , you are a true prophet , and both your eyes are whole . " " Go tell White Murderer Harrison that I have performedthe sign he asked for . And tell him another sign that he did n't ask for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own house . No man 's hand will set this fire . Only rain will put out this fire , and before the fire dies , it will cut off something he loves more than a hand or a foot or an eye , and he will not have the power to restore it , either . "  |p101HOOCH  WAS ASTOUNDED . " You mean you do n't want the whole shipment ? " We ai n't used up what you sold us last time , Hooch , " said the quartermaster . " Four barrels , that 's all we want . More than we need , to tell the truth . " " I come down the river from Dekane , loaded up with likker , not stopping to sell any at the towns along the way , I make that sacrifice and you tell me  --  " " Now , Hooch , I reckon we all know what kind of sacrifice that was . " The quartermaster smirked a little . " I think you 'll still recover your costs , pretty much , and if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been careful with the profits you 've made off us afore . " " Who else is selling to you ? " " Nobody , " said the quartermaster . " I been coming to Carthage City for nigh on sevenyears now , and the last four years I 've had a monopoly  --  " " And if you 'll pay heed , you 'll remember that in theld days it used to be Reds what bought most of yourikker . " Hooch looked around , walked away from the quarteraster , stood on the moist grassy ground of the riverbank . His flatboat rocked lazily on the water . There was n't a Red to be seen , not a one , and that was a fact . But it was n't no conspiracy , Hooch knew that . Reds had been slacking offp102the last few times he came . Always there used to be a few drunks , though . He turned and shouted at the quartermaster . " You telling me there ai n't no whisky-Reds left ! " " Sure there 's whisky-Reds . But we ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all off somewhere lying around being drunk . " Hooch cussed a little . " I 'm going to see the Gov about this . " " Not today you ai n't , " said the quartermaster . " He 's got himself a right busy schedule . " Hooch grinned nastily . " Oh , his schedule ai n't too busy for me . " " It sure is , Hooch . He said it real specific . " " I reckon he might think his schedule is too busy , boy , but I reckon it just ai n't so . " " Suit yourself , " said the quartermaster . " Want me to unload the four barrels I got here ? " " No I do n't , " he said . Then he shouted at his poleboys , most specially at that Mike Fink , cause he looked to be the most likely to do murder if need be . " Anybody tries to lay a hand on that whisky , I want to see four bullet holes in their body before we chuck him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Mike Fink , who just sort of screwed his face up a little tighter . That was one mean old boy . They said you could tell which men had ever tried to wrassle Mike Fink , cause they got no ears . They said , if you want to get away from Fink with one ear still on your head , you got to wait till he 's chewing on your first ear and then shoot him twice to distracthim while you get away . A real good riverboy . But it made Hooch a little nervy to think what Fink might do if Hooch did n't have a payroll for him . Bill Harrison was going to pay for this whole load of likker , or there 'd be real trouble . Walking into the stockade , Hooch noticed a few things . The sign was the same one Harrison put up four years ago ; it was getting ratty-looking now , weathered up , but nobody changed it . Town was n't growing either . Everythinghad lost that new look , and now it was plain shabby. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territory . What used to be little stockade towns like this were turning into real towns , with painted houses , even a few cobbled streets . Hio was booming , at least the eastern part of it , close on to Suskwahenny , and folks speculated on how it was n't far from statehood . But there was n't no boom going on in Cathage City . Hooch walked along the main street inside the stockade . Still plenty of soldiers , and they still looked to have pretty good discipline , had to give Governor Bill credit for that . But where there used to be whisky-Reds sprawled all over the place , now there was river-rat types , uglier-lookingthan Mike Fink , unshaved , with a whisky stink as bad as any likkered-up Red ever had . Four old buildings had been turned into saloons , too , and they were doing good business in the middle of the afternoon . That 's why , thought Hooch . That 's the trouble . CarthageCity 's gone and turned into a river town , a saloon town . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats . It 's a whisky town . But if it 's a whisky town , Governor Bill ought to be buying whisky from me instead of this business about only wanting four barrels . " You can wait if you want , Mr. Palmer , but the Governorwo n't see you today . " Hooch sat on the bench outside Harrison 's office . He noticed that Harrison had switched offices with his adjutant . Gave up his nice big office in exchange for what ? Smaller space , but  --  all interior walls . No windows . Now , that meant something . That meant Harrison did n't like having people look in on him . Maybe he was even afraid of getting himself killed . Hooch sat there for two hours , watching soldiers come in and out . He tried not to get mad . Harrison did this now and then , making somebody sit around and wait so by the time they got in they was so upset they could n't think straight . And sometimes he did it so a body 'd get in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unimportant , so Harrison could do some bullying . Hooch knew all this , so he tried to stay calm . But when it got on to evening , andp104the soldiers started changing shifts and going off duty , it was more than he could stand . " What do you think you 're doing ? " he demanded of the corporal who sat at the front desk . " Going off duty , " said the corporal . " But I 'm still here , " said Hooch . " You can go off duty too , if you like , " said the corporal . That smart-mouthed answer was like a slap in the face . Time was these boys all tried to suck up to Hooch Palmer . Times were changing too fast . Hooch did n't like it at all . " I could buy your old mother and sell her at a profit , " said Hooch . That got to him . That corporal did n't look bored no more . But he did n't let himself haul off and take a swing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , and said , " Mr. Palmer , you can wait here all night and wait here all day tomorrow , and you ai n't going to get in to see His Excellency the Governor . And you just sitting here waiting all day is proof you 're just too plain dumb to catch on to how things are . " So it was Hooch lost his temper and took a swing . Well , not a swing exactly . More like a kick , cause Hooch never did learn no rules about fighting like a gentleman . His idea of a duel was to wait behind a rock for his enemy to pass by , shoot him in the back , and run like hell . So that corporal got Hooch 's big old boot in his knee , which bent his leg backward in a way it was n't meant to go . That corporal screamed bloody murder , which he had a right to , and not just from the pain  --  after a kick like that , his leg would never be any good again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that boy was so snooty . Practically begged for it . Trouble was , the corporal was n't exactly alone . First yelp he made , all of a sudden there was a sergeant and four soldiers , bayonets at the ready , popping right out of the Governor 's office and looking mad as hornets . The sergeantordered two of his boys to carry the corporal to the infirmary . The others put Hooch under arrest . But it was n't gentlemanly like that last time , four years before . This time the butts of their muskets got bumped intop105Hooch 's body in a few places , sort of accidentally , and Hooch had him some boot prints in various places on his clothes , ca n't say how they got there . He ended up locked in a jail cell  --  no storage room this time . They left him with his clothes and a lot of pain . No doubt about it . Things had changed around here . That night six other men were put in lock-up , three of them drunks , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them talking . It 's not like any of them was particularlybright , but Hooch could n't believe that they did n't talk about beating up no Reds , or making fun with some of them or something . It was like Reds had practicallydisappeared from the vicinity . Well , maybe that was true . Maybe the Reds had all took off , but was n't that what Governor Harrison hoped for ? With the Reds gone , why was n't Carthage City prosperous , full of White settlers ? The only inkling Hooch got was something one of the brawlers said . " I reckon I 'm broke till tax season . " The others whooped and hollered a little . " I got to say I do n't mind government service , but it sure ai n't steady work . " Hooch knew better than to ask them what they meant . No need to call attention to himself . He sure did n't want word getting around about how he looked all beat up the night he spent in jail . That kind of idea starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body up , and Hooch did n't reckon to start all over as a common street brawler , not at his age . In the morning the soldiers came for him . Different ones , and this time they was n't so careless with their feet and their musket butts . They just marched Hooch on out of the jail and now , finally , he got to see Bill Harrison . But not in his office . It was in his own Governor 's mansion , in a cellar room . And the way they got there was peculiar . The soldiers  --  must have been a dozen of them  --  just marched along behind the house , when all of a sudden one of them dashed over , flung up the cellar door , and two others half dragged Hooch down the steps . Cellar door slammed shut almost before their heads were clear of it , and in all that time the soldiers just kept right on marching , as if nothing was happening . Hooch did n't like that atp106all . It meant that Harrison did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which meant this meeting could get pretty ugly , cause Harrison could deny it ever happened . Oh , the soldiers knew , of course , but they all knew about a certain corporal who got his knee bent the wrong way last night ; they were n't about to testify on Hooch Palmer 's behalf . Harrison was his old self , though , smiling and shakingHooch by the hand and clapping him on the shoulder . " How are you , Hooch ? " " I been better , Gov . How 's your wife ? And that little boy of yours ? " " She 's healthy as you could hope for , a refined lady like her being out here on the frontier . And my little boy , he 's quite a soldier , we even stitched him up a little uniform , you should see him strutting on parade . " " It 's talk like that makes me think I ought to take a wife someday . " " I heartily recommend it . Oh , here , Hooch , what am I thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hooch sat . " Thanks , Bill . " Harrison nodded , satisfied . " It 's good to see you , it 's been so long . " " Wisht I 'd 've seen you yesterday , " said Hooch . Harrison smiled ruefully . " Well , I get busy . Did n't my boys tell you I had a full-up schedule ? " " Schedule never used to be full for me , Bill . " " You know how it gets sometimes . Real busy , and what can I do about it ? " Hooch shook his head . " Now , Bill , we 've lied to each other just about long enough , I think . What happened was part of a plan , and it was n't my plan . " " What are you talking about , Hooch ? " " I 'm saying maybe that corporal did n't want his leg broke , but I have a feeling his job was to get me swinging at him . " " His job was to see that nobody disturbed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the only plan I know about . " Harrison looked sad . " Hooch , I got to tell you , this is real ugly . Assaulting an officer of the U.S. Army . "  | " A corporal ai n't no officer , Bill . " " I only wish I could ship you back to Suskwahenny for trial , Hooch . They got lawyers there , and juries , and so on . But the trial has to be here , and juries around here ai n't too partial to folks who go around breaking corpo- , rals ' knees . " " Suppose you stop the threats and tell me what you really want ? " " Want ? I ai n't asking for favors , Hooch . Just concerned about a friend of mine who 's got himself in trouble with the law . " " It must be something real sickening or you 'd bribe me to do it instead of trying to strong-arm me . It must be something that you think I would n't be willing to do unless you scare me to death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad that you think I would n't do it . It ai n't much of a list , Bill . " Harrison shook his head . " Hooch , you got me wrong . Just plain wrong . " " This town is dying , Bill , " said Hooch . " Things ai n't working out like you planned . And I think it 's cause you done some real dumb things . I think the Reds started going away  --  or maybe they all died off  --  and you made the stupid mistake of trying to make up for all that lost likker income by bringing in the scum of the earth , the worst kind of White man , the river rats who spent the night in jail with me . You 've used them to collect taxes , right ? Farmers do n't like taxes . They specially do n't like taxes when they 're collected by scum like this . " Harrison poured himself three fingers of whisky in a tumbler and drank off half of it in a single gulp . " So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White farmers , and all you got left is your soldiers , the river rats , and whatever money you can steal from the United States Army appropriation for peace-keepingin the west . " Harrison drank the rest of the whisky and belched . " What that means is you 've been unlucky and you 've been stupid , and somehow you think you can make me get you out of it . " Harrison poured another three lingers into the glass.  |p108But  instead of drinking it , he hauled off and threw it into Hooch 's face . The whisky splashed in his eyes , the tumblerbounced off his forehead , and Hooch found himself rolling on the floor trying to dig the alcohol out of his eyes . A while later , with a wet cloth pressed against his forehead , Hooch was sitting in the chair again , acting a lot more meek and reasonable . But that was because he knew Harrison had a flush and his own hand was just two pair . Get out of here alive and then just see what comes next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . No , you 're the smartest governor Carthage ever had , I 'm surprised you ai n't King . That 's what Hooch would 've said . But he was keeping his mouth shut . " It was that Prophet . That Red up north . Building his Prophetstown right across the Wobbish from Vigor Church  --  you ca n't tell me that 's just a coincidence . It 's Armor-of-God , that 's what it is , trying to take the state of Wobbish away from me . Using a Red to do it , too . I knew that a lot of Reds were going north , everybody knew that , but I still had me my whisky-Reds , them as had n't died off . And with fewer Reds around here  --  especially the Shaw-Nee , when they left  --  well , I thought I 'd get more White settlers . And you 're wrong about my tax collectors . They did n't run the White settlers off . It was Ta-Kum-saw . " " I thought it was the Prophet . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much patience these days . " Why did n't you warn me before you threw the glass ? No , no , do n't say nothing to make him mad . " Sorry , Bill . " " Ta-Kumsaw 's been real smart . He does n't kill White folks . He just shows up at their farms with fifty ShawNee . Does n't shoot anybody , but when you got fifty painted-up warriors all around your house , these White folks did n't exactly figure it was smart to start shooting . So the White farmers watched while the Shaw-Nee opened every gate , every stable , every coop . Let them animals go on out . Horses , pigs , milk cows , chickens . Just like Noahp109bringing beasts into the ark , the Shaw-Nee walk into the woods and the animals trot on right behind . Just like that . Never see them again . " " You ca n't tell me they never round up at least some of their stock . " " All gone . Never find even their tracks . Never even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White farmers off , is knowing that any day , all their animals can disap-pear . " " Shaw-Nee eating them or something ? Ai n't no chicken smart enough to live long in the woods . It 's just Christmastime for foxes , that 's all it is . " " How should I know ? White folks come to me , they say , Get our animals back , or kill the Reds what took them . But my soldiers , my scouts , nobody can find where Ta-Kumsaw 's people are . No villages at all ! I tried raiding a Caska-Skeeaw village up the Little My-Ammy , but all that did was convince more Reds to leave , did n't even slow down what Ta-Kumsaw was doing . " Hooch could imagine what that raid on the CaskaSkeeawvillage was like . Old men , women , children , their corpses shot up and half-burnt  --  Hooch knew how Harrisondealt with Reds . " And then last month , here comes the Prophet . I knew he was coming  --  even the whisky-Reds could n't talk about nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theProphet . Well , I tried to find out where he was going to be , where he was going to give a speech , I even had some of my tame Reds try to find out for me , but no dice , Hooch . Not a clue . Nobody knew . Just one day the word went through the whole town , Prophet 's here . Where ? Just come on , Prophet 's here . No one ever said where . I swear these Reds can talk without talking , if you know what I mean . " " Bill , tell me you had spies there , or I 'll start to thinking you lost your touch . " " Spies ? I went myself , how 's that ? And do you know how ? Ta-Kumsaw sent me an invitation , if that do n't beat all . No soldiers , no guns , just me . " And you went ' ? He could 've captured you and  --  "  | " He gave me his word . Ta-Kumsaw may be a Red , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of funny . Harrison , the man who prided himself on never keeping a promise to a Red man , but he still counted on Ta-Kumsaw keeping a promise to him . Well , he got back alive , did n't he ? So TaKumsawwas as good as his word . " I went there . Must 've been every Red in the whole My-Ammy country there . Must 've been ten thousand . Squatting around in this old abandoned cornfield  --  there 's plenty of them in these parts , you can bet , thanks to TaKumsaw . If I 'd had my two cannon there and a hundred soldiers , I could 've ended the whole Red problem , then and there . " " Too bad you did n't , " said Hooch . " Ta-Kumsaw wanted me to sit right up front , but I would n't . I hung back and I listened . The Prophet got up , stood on an old stump in the field , and he talked and talked and talked . " " You understand any of it ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was talking English , Hooch . Too many different tribes there , the only language they all knew was English . Oh , sometimes he talked in that Red gibberish , but there was plenty of English . Talking about the destiny of the Red man . Stay pure from White contamination . Live all together and fill up a part of the land so the White man will have his place and the Red man will have his . Build a city  --  a crystal city , he said , it sounded real pretty except these Reds ca n't even build a proper shed , I hate to think how they 'd do at building a city out of glass ! But most of all , he said , Do n't drink likker . Not a drop . Give it up , stay away from it . Likker is the chain of the White man , the chain and the whip , the chain and the whip and the knife . First he 'll catch you , then he 'll whip you , then he 'll kill you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with his whisky , he 'll come in and steal your land , destroy it , make it unfit , dead , useless . " " Sounds like he made a real impression on you , Bill , " said Hooch . " Sounds like you memorized the speech he gave . "  | " Memorized ? He talked for three straight hours . Talked about visions of the past , visions of the future . Talked about  --  oh , Hooch , it was crazy stuff , but those Reds were drinking it up like , like  --  " " Whisky . " " Like whisky except it was instead of whisky . They all went with him . Pretty near all of them , anyway . Only ones left are a few whisky-Reds that 're bound to die soon . And of course my tame Reds , but that 's different . And some wild Reds across the Hio . " " Went with him where ? " " Prophetstown ! That 's what kills me , Hooch . They all go up to Prophetstown , or thereabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's exactly where all the Whites are going ! Well , not all to Vigor Church , but up into the lands where Armor-of-Hell Weaver has his maps . They 're in cahoots , Hooch , I promise you that . Ta-Kumsaw , Armor-ofGodWeaver , and the Prophet . " " Sounds like . " " The worst thing is I had that Prophet here in my own office must be a thousand times , I could have killed that boy and saved myself more trouble  --  but you never know , do you ? " " You know this Prophet ? " " You mean you do n't know who it is ? " " I do n't know that many Reds by name , Bill . " " How about if I tell you that he 's only got one eye ? " " You ai n't saying it 's Lolla-Wossiky ! " " Reckon so . " " That one-eyed drunk ? " " God 's own truth , Hooch . Calls himself TenskwaTawanow . It means the open door ' or something . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I had the chance . But I figured when he ran off  --  he ran off , you know , stole a keg and took off into the woods  --  " " I was here that night , I helped chase him . " " Well when he did n't come back , I figured he probahlydrank himself to death off that keg . But there he is telling Reds how he used to have to drink all the time , but God sent him visions and he 's never had another drink . " " Send me visions , I 'd give up drinking , too . "  |p112Harrison  took another swallow of whisky . From the jug , this time , since the tumbler was on the floor in the corner of the room . " You see my problem , Hooch . " " I see you got lots of problems , Bill , and I do n't know how any of them has a thing to do with me , except you were n't joking when you had the quartermaster tell me you only wanted four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with you than that , count on it , Hooch . More than that . Because I ai n't beat . The Prophet 's took away all my whisky-Reds , and Ta-Kumsaw'sgot my White citizens scared , but I ai n't quitting . " " No , you 're no quitter , " said Hooch . You 're a slimy sneaky snake of a man , but you 're no quitter . Did n't say that , of course , cause Harrison was bound to take it wrong  --  but to Hooch , it was all praise . His kind of man . " It 's Ta-Kumsaw and the Prophet , simple as that . I got to kill them . No , no , I take it back . I got to beat them and kill them . I got to take them on and make them both look like fools and then kill them . " " Good idea . I 'll handle the betting on it . " " I bet you would . Stand there taking bets . Well , I ca n't just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophetstown , cause Armor-of-God would fight me every step of the way , probably get the army detachmentat Fort Wayne to back him up . Probably get my commission stripped or something . So I 've got to arrange things so the people in Vigor Church , all along the Wobbish , they all beg me to come up and get rid of them Reds . " Now , at last , Hooch understood what this was all about . " You want a provocation . " " That 's my boy , Hooch . That 's my boy . I want some Reds to go up north and make some real trouble , and tell everybody that Ta-Kumsaw and the Prophet told them to do it . Blame it all on them . " Hooch nodded . " I see . It could n't be just running off their cows or nothing like that . No , the only thing that 'll get those people up north screaming for Red blood is something real ugly . Like capturing children and torturing them to death and then signing Ta-Kumsaw 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something like that . " " Well , I would n't go so far as to tell anybody to do something awful like that , Hooch . In fact I do n't reckon I 'd give them specific instructions at all . Just tell them to do something that 'd rile up the Whites up north , and then spread the word that Ta-Kumsaw ordered it . " " But you would n't be surprised if it turned out to be rape and torture . " " I would n't want them to touch any White women , Hooch . That 's out of line . " " Oh , that 's right , pure truth , " said Hooch . " So it 's definitely torturing children . Boy children . " " Like I said , I would n't ever tell somebody to do a thing like that . " Hooch nodded a little , his eyes closed . Harrison might not tell somebody to do it , but he sure was n't telling him not to do it , either . " And of course it could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , cause they 're all gone , and your tame Reds are the most worthless scum that ever lived on the face of the earth . " " Pretty much , that 's true . " " So you need Reds from south of the river . Reds who still have n't heard the Prophet 's preaching , so they still want likker . Reds who still have brains enough to do the job right . Reds who have the blood thirst to kill children real slow . And you need my cargo as a bribe . " " Reckon so , Hooch . " " You got it , Bill . Dismiss charges against me , and you got all my likker free . Just give me enough money to pay off my poleboys so they do n't knife me on the way home , I hope that ai n't too much to ask . " " Now , Hooch , you know that ai n't all I need . " " But Bill , that 's all I 'll do . " " I ca n't be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be the one to go tell them Cree-Eks or Choc-Taws what I need done . It 's got to be somebody else , somebody who if it gets found out I can say , I never told him to do that . He used his own whisky to do it , I did n't have any idea . " " Bill , I understand you , but you guessed right fromp114the start . You actually found something so low that I wo n't be part of it . " Harrison glowered at him . " Assaulting an officer is a hanging offense in this fort , Hooch . Did n't I make that clear ? " " Bill , I 've lied , cheated , and sometimes killed to get ahead in the world . But one thing I 've never done is bribe somebody to go steal some mother 's children and torture them to death . I honestly never did that , and I honestly never will . " Harrison studied Hooch 's face and saw that it was true . " Well , do n't that beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooch Palmer wo n't do it , even if he dies because of it . " " You wo n't kill me , Bill . " " Oh yes I will , Hooch . There 's two reasons I will . First , you gave me the wrong answer to my request . And second , you heard my request in the first place . You 're a dead man , Hooch . " " Fine with me , " said Hooch . " Make it a real scratchy rope , too . A good and tall gallows , with a twenty-foot drop . I want a hanging that folks 'll remember for a long time . " " You 'll get a tree limb and we 'll raise the rope up slow , so you strangle instead of breaking your neck . " " Just so it 's memorable , " said Hooch . Harrison called in some soldiers and had them take Hooch back to jail . This time they did a little kicking and poking , so Hooch had a whole new batch of bruises , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . So he lay down real calm on the floor of the jail . The drunks were gone , but the three brawlers were still there , using all the cots ; the floor was all that was available . Hooch did n't much care . He knew Harrison would give him an hour or two to think about it , then take him out and put the rope around his neck and kill him . He might pretend to give him one last chance , of course , but he would n't mean it , because now he would n't trust Hooch . Hooch had told him no , and so he 'd never trust him to carry out the assignment if he let him go.  |p115Well  , Hooch planned to use the time wisely . He started out pretty simply . He closed his eyes and let some heat build up inside him . A spark . And then he sent that spark outside himself . It was like what doodlebugs said they did , sending out their bug to go searching undergroundand see what it could see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found what he was looking for . Governor Bill 's own house . His spark was too far away by now for him to find some particular spot in the house . And his aim could n't be too tight . So instead he just pumped all his hate and rage and pain into the spark , built it hotter and hotter and hotter . He let himself go like he never done before in his life . And he kept pushing it and pushing it until he started hearing that most welcome sound . " Fire ! Fire ! " The shouts came from outside , from far away , but more and more people took up the cry . Gunshots went off  --  distress signals . The three brawlers heard it , too . One of them stepped on Hooch where he was lying on the floor , they were in such a hurry . Stood at the door , they did , rattling and shouting at the guard . " Let us out ! Do n't go trying to fight that fire without letting us out first ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly noticed the man stepping on him , he already hurt so bad . Instead he just lay there , using his spark again , only this time heating up the metal inside the lock of the jail door . Now his aim was tight and his spark could get much hotter . The guard came in and put his key in the lock , turned it , opened the door . " You boys can come on out , " he said . " Sergeant said so , we need you to help with the fire brigade . " Hooch struggled to his feet , but the guard straightarmedhim and shoved him back into the cell . Hooch was n't surprised . But he made the spark go hotter yet , so hot that now the iron of the lock melted inside . It even glowed red a little . The guard slammed the door shut and went to turn the key . By now it was so hot that it burned his hand . He cussed and went for his shirttail to try and grab the key , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stomped the guard in the face and kicked his head , which probably broke his neck , but Hooch did n't think of that as murder . He thought of it as justice , cause the guard had been all set to leave him locked in his cell to burn to death . Hooch walked on out of the jail . Nobody paid him much attention . He could n't see the mansion from here , but he could see the smoke rising . Sky was low and grey . Probably it 'd rain before it burned the stockade . Hooch sure hoped not , though . Hoped the whole place burned to the ground . It was one thing to want to kill off Reds , that was fine with Hooch , he and Harrison saw eye to eye on that . Kill them with likker if you can , bullets if you ca n't . But you do n't go killing White folks , you do n't go hiring Reds to torture White babies . Maybe to Harrison it was all part of the same thing . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a war with Reds , only the soldiers'djust be a little younger . All in a good cause , right ? Maybe Harrison could think that way , but Hooch could n't . It actually took him by surprise , to tell the truth . He was more like Andrew Jackson than he ever supposed . He had a line he would n't cross . He drew it in a different place than old Hickory did , but still , he had a line , and he 'd die before he crossed it . Of course he did n't reckon to die if he could help it . He could n't go out the stockade gate , cause the bucket line to the river would go through there and he 'd be seen . But it was easy enough to climb up to the parapet . The soldiers were n't exactly keeping a lookout . He clambered over the wall and dropped down outside the fort . Nobody saw him . He walked the ten yards into the woods , then made his way  --  slowly , cause his ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much sparking , it took something out of him  --  through the woods to the riverbank . He came out of the woods on the far side of the open area around the wharf . There was his flatboat , still loaded up with all his kegs . And his poleboys standing around , watching the bucket brigade dipping into the river some thirty yards farther upstream . It did n't surprise Hooch a bit that his poleboys were n't over there helping with the buckets . They were n't exactly the public-spirited type.  |p117Hooch  walked out onto the wharf , beckoning for the poleboys to come join him . He jumped down to the flatboat ; stumbled a little , from being weak and hurting . He turned around to tell his boys what was happening , why they had to push off , but they had n't followed . They just stood there on the bank , looking at him . He beckoned again , but they did n't make a move to come . Well , then , he 'd go without them . He was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , when he realized that not all the poleboys were on shore . No , there was one missing . And he knew right where that missing boy would be . Right there on the flatboat , standingright behind him , reaching out his handsMike Fink was n't the knifing kind . Oh , he 'd knife you if he had to , but he 'd rather kill with his bare hands . He used to say something about killing with a knife , some comparison with whores and a broomstick . Anyway , that 's why Hooch knew that it would n't be a knife . That it would n't be quick . Harrison must 've known Hooch might get away , so he bought off Mike Fink , and now Fink would kill him sure . Sure , but slow . And slow gave Hooch time . Time to make sure he did n't die alone . So as the fingers closed around his throat and cinched tight , much tighter than Hooch ever imagined , clamping him so he thought his head would get wrung right off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that keg , that one place , he knew right where the place was on the flatboat , to hot up that keg , as hot as he could , hotter , hot-terAndhe waited for the explosion , waited and waited , but it never came . It felt like Fink 's fingers had pressed through the front of his throat clear to the spine , and he felt all his muscles just give way , he felt himself kicking , his lungs heaving to try to suck in air that just would n't come , but he kept his spark going till the last second , waiting for the gunpowder keg to blow . Then he died . Mike Fink hung on to him for another whole minute after he was dead , maybe just cause he liked the feel of a dead man dangling from his hands . Hard to tell with Mikep118Fink . Some folks said he was as nice a man as you could hope to find , when he was in the mood . Sure that 's what Mike thought of himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociable . But when it came to killing , well , he liked that too . But you ca n't just hang on to a dead body forever . For one thing , somebody 's going to start complaining about it or maybe puking . So he shoved Hooch 's body off into the water . " Smoke , " said one of the poleboys , pointing . Sure enough , there was smoke coming out of the middle of the pile of kegs . " It 's the gunpowder keg ! " shouted one of them . Well , the poleboys took off running to get away from the explosion , but Mike Fink just laughed and laughed . He walked over and started unloading kegs , hoisting them onto the wharf , unloading them until he got to the middle where there was a keg with a fuse coming out of it . He did n't pick that one up with his hands , though . He tipped it over with his heel , then kind of rolled it along till it was on the open area around the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to see what was going on , since it looked pretty much like Mike Fink was n't going to blow up after all . " Hatchet , " Mike called out , and one of the boys tossed him the one he kept in a sheath at his belt . It took a few good whacks , but the top finally sprung off the keg , and a whole cloud of steam came up . The water inside was so hot it was still boiling . " You mean it was n't gunpowder after all ? " asked of the boys . Not a bright one , but then not many rivermen was famous for brains . " Oh , it was gunpowder when he set it down here , " said Mike . " Back in Suskwahenny . But you do n't think Mike Fink ' d go all the way down the Hio River on the same flatboat with a keg of powder with a fuse coming out of it , do you ? " Then Mike jumped off the boat up onto the wharf and bellowed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him clear inside the fort , so loud that the bucket brigade stopped long enough to listen . " My name is Mike Fink , boys , and I 'm the meanestp119lowdown son of an alligator that ever bit off the head of a buffalo ! I eat growed men 's ears for breakfast and bears ' ears for supper , and when I 'm thirsty I can drink enough to stop Niagara from falling . When I piss folks get on flatboats and float downstream for fifty mile , and when I fart the Frenchmen catch the air in bottles and sell it for perfume . I 'm Mike Fink , and this my flatboat , and if you miserable little pukes ever put that fire out , there 's a free pint of whisky in it for every one of you ! " Then Mike Fink led the poleboys over and joined the bucket brigade , and they slowed the fire down until the rain came and put it out . That night , with all the soldiers drinking and singing , Mike Fink was sitting up sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the likker business for himself . Only one of the poleboys was with him now , the youngest fellow , who kind of looked up to Fink . The boy was setting there playing with the fuse that used to go into a gunpowder keg . " This fuse was n't lit , " said the poleboy . " No , I reckon not , " said Mike Fink . " Well , how 'd the water get to boiling then ? " " Reckon Hooch had a few tricks up his sleeve . Reckon Hooch had something to do with the fire in the fort . " " You knew that , did n't you ? " Fink shook his head . " Nope , just lucky . I 'm just plain lucky . I just get a feeling about things , like I had a feeling about that gunpowder keg , and I just do what I feel like doing . " " You mean like a knack ? " In answer , Fink stood up and pulled down his trousers . There on his left buttock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mama had that poked on when I was n't a month old . Said that 'd keep me safe so I 'd live out my whole natural life . " He turned and showed the boy the other buttock . " And that one she said was to help me make my fortune . I did n't know how it 'd work , and she died without telling me , but as near as I can tell it makes me lucky . Makes it so I just kind of knowp120what I ought to do . " He grinned . " Got me a flatboat now , and a cargo of whisky , do n't I ? " " Is the Governor really going to give you a medal for killing Hooch ? " " Well , for catching him , anyhow , looks like . " " I do n't guess the Gov looked too bothered that old Hooch was dead , though . " " Nope , " said Fink . " No , I reckon not . No , me and the Gov , we 're good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need doing , that only a man like me can do . " The poleboy looked at him with adoration in his eighteen-year-old eyes . " Can I help you ? Can I come with you ? " " You ever been in a fight ? " " A lot of fights ! " " You ever bit off an ear ? " " No , but I gouged out a man 's eye once . " " Eyes are easy . Eyes are soft . " " And I butted a man 's head so he lost five teeth . " Fink considered that for a few seconds . Then he grinned and nodded . " Sure , you come along with me , boy . By the time I 'm through , there ai n't a man woman or child within a hundred mile of this river who wo n't know my name . Do you doubt that , boy ? " The boy did n't doubt it . In the morning , Mike Fink and his crew pushed off for the south bank of the Hio , loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whisky . Bound to do a little tradingwith the Reds . In the afternoon , Governor William Harrison buried the charred remains of his second wife and their little boy , who had the misfortune of being in the nursery together , dressing the boy in his little parade uniform , when the room burst into flames . A fire in his own house , set by no hand , which cut off what he loved the most , and no power on earth could bring them back.  |p121ALVIN  JUNIOR NEVER FELT SMALL except when he wassetting on the back of a big old horse . Not to say he was n't a good rider  --  he and horses got along pretty good , they never throwing him and he never whipping them . It 's just that his legs stuck way out on both sides , and since he was riding with a saddle on this trip , the stirrup had to be hiked up so far they punched new holes in the leather so he could ride . Al was looking forward to the day he growed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right big for his age , but that did n't amount to nothing in Alvin'sopinion . When your age is ten , big for your age ai n't nothing like being big . " I do n't like it , " said Faith Miller . " Do n't like sendingmy boys off in the middle of all these Red troubles . " Mother always worried , but she had good cause . All his life Al was kind of clumsy , always having accidents . Things turned out fine in the end , but it was nip and tuck a lot of the time . Worst was a few months ago , when the new millstone fell on his leg and gave it a real ugly break . It looked like he was going to die , and he pretty much expected to himself . Would have , too . Surely would have . Even though he knew he had the power to heal himself . Ever since the Shining Man came to him in his room that night when he was six , Al had never used his knack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could do , cause it would help everybody . He 'd run his fingers on thep122stone , get the feel of it , find the hidden places in the stone where it could break , and then set it all in order , just make it go that way ; and the stone would come out , just right , just the way he asked . But never for his own good . Then with his leg broke and the skin tore up , everybodyknowed he was bound to die . And Al never would 've used his knack for fixing things to heal himself , never would 've tried , except old Taleswapper was there . Taleswapper asked him , why do n't you fix your leg yourself ? And so Al told him what he never told a soul before , about the Shining Man . Taleswapper believed him , too , did n't think he was crazy or dreaming . He made Al think back , think real hard , and remember what the Shining Man said . And when Al remembered , it come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never doing it for himself . The Shining Man just said , " Make all things whole . " Make all things whole . Well , was n't his leg part of " all things " ? So he fixed it , best he could . There was a lot more to it than that , but all in all he used his own power , with the help of his family , to heal himself . That 's why he was alive . But during those days he looked death in the face and he was n't as scared of it as he thought he 'd be . Lying there with death seeping through his bone , he began to feel like his body was just a kind of lean-to , a shelter he lived in during bad weather till his house was built . Like them shanty cabins new folks built till they could get a log house set up proper . And if he died , it would n't be awful at all . Just different , and maybe better . So when his ma went on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they might get killed , he did n't give no heed . Not because he thought that she was wrong , but because he did n't much care whether he died or not . Well , no , that was n't quite so . He had a lot of things to do , though he did n't know yet what they were , and so he 'd be annoyed about dying . He sure did n't plan to die . It just did n't fill him up with fear like it did some folks . Al 's big brother Measure was trying to get Ma to easep123off and not get herself all worked up . " We 'll be all right , Mama , " said Measure . " All the trouble 's down south , and we 'll be on good roads all the way . " " Folks disappear every week on those good roads , " she said . " Those French up in Detroit are buying scalps , they do n't never let up on that , do n't matter one bit what Ta-Kumsaw and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you  --  " " Ma , " said Measure . " If you 're a-scared of Reds getting us , you ought to want us to go . I mean there 's ten thousand Reds at least living in Prophetstown right across the river . It 's the biggest city west of Philadelphia right now , and every one of them is a Red . We 're getting away from Reds by going east  --  " " That one-eyed Prophet do n't worry me , " she said . " He never talks about killing . I just think you should n't  --  " " It do n't matter what you think , " said Pa . Ma turned to face him . He 'd been slopping the hogs out back , but now he was come around to say good-bye . " Do n't you tell me it do n't matter what I  --  " " It do n't matter what I think , neither , " said Pa . " It do n't matter what anybody thinks , and you know it . " " Then I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , if that 's how things are , Alvin Miller ! " " Al 's going east to Hatrack River to be an apprentice blacksmith , " said Pa . " I 'll miss him , you 'll miss him , everybody except maybe Reverend Thrower 's going to miss the boy , but the papers are signed and Al Junior is going . So instead of jawing how you do n't want them to go , kiss the boys good-bye and wave them off . " If Pa 'd been milk she would 've curdled him on the spot , she gave him such a look . " I 'll kiss my boys , and I 'll wave them off , " she said . " I do n't need you to tell me that . I do n't need you to tell me anything . " " I reckon not , " said Pa . " But I 'll tell you anyway , and I reckon you 'll return the favor , just like you always done . " He reached up a hand to shake with Measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there safe and come right back , " he told Measure . " You know I will , " said Measure.  | " Your ma 's right , it 's dangerous every step of the way , so keep your eyes open . We named you right , you got such keen eyes , boy , so use them . " " I will , Pa . " Ma said her good-bye to Measure while Pa came on over to Al . He gave Al a good stinging slap on the leg and shook his hand , too , and that felt good , Pa treating him like a man , just like Measure . Maybe if Al was n't sitting up on a horse , Pa would 've roughed his hair like a little boy , but then maybe he would n't have , either , and it still felt grown-up , all the same . " I ai n't scared of the Reds , " said Al . He spoke real soft , so Ma would n't hear . " But I sure wish I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Pa . " But you got to . For your own good . " Then Pa got that faraway sad look on his face , which Al Junior had seen before more than once , and never understood . Pa was a strange man . It took Al a long time to realize that , since for the longest time while Al was just little , Pa was Pa , and he did n't try to understand him . Now Al was getting older , and he began to compare his father to the other men around . To Armor-of-God Weaver , for instance , the most important man in town , always talking about peace with the Red man , sharing the land with him , mapping out Red lands and White lands  --  everybody listened to him with respect . Nobody listened to Pa that way , considering his words real serious , maybe arguing a little , but knowing that what he said was important . And Reverend Thrower , with his highfalutin educated way of talking , shouting from his pulpit about death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , everybody listened to him , too . It was different from the way they listened to Armor , cause it was always about religion and so it did n't have nothing to do with little stuff like farming and chores and how folks lived . But respect . When Pa talked , other folks listened to him , all right , but they just scoffed sometimes . " Oh , Alvin Miller , you just go on , do n't you ! " Al noticed that , and it made him mad at first . But then he realized that when folks was inp125trouble and needed help , they did n't go to Reverend Thrower , no sir , and they did n't go to Armor-of-God , cause neither of them knew all that much about how to solve the kind of problems folks had from time to time . Thrower might tell them how to stay out of hell , but that was n't till they was dead , and Armor might tell them how to keep peace with the Reds , but that was politics except when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boundaryline , or did n't know what to do about a boy that alwayssassed his ma no matter how many lickings he got , or when the weevils got their seed corn and they did n't have nothing to plant , they come to Al Miller . And he 'd say his piece , just a few words usually , and they 'd go off shaking their heads and saying , " Oh , Alvin Miller , you just go on , do n't you ! " But then they 'd go ahead and settlethat boundary line and build them a stone fence there ; and they 'd let their smart-mouth boy move on out of the house and take up as a hired man on a neighbor 's farm ; and come planting time a half-dozen folks 'd come by with sacks of " spare " seed cause Al Miller mentioned they might be a little shy . When Al Junior compared his pa to other men , he knew Pa was strange , knew Pa did things for reasons known only to himself . But he also knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to Armor-of-God and Reverend Philadelphia Thrower , but they trusted Al Miller . So did Al Junior . Trusted his pa . Even though he did n't want to leave home , even though having been so close to death he felt like apprenticing and suchlike was a waste of time  --  what did it matter what his trade was , would there be smiths in heaven ?  --  still he knew that if Pa said it was right for him to go , then Al would go . The way folks always knew that if Al Miller said , " Just do this and it 'll work out , " why , they should do the thing he said , and it 'd work out like he said . He had told Pa he did n't want to go ; Pa had said , Go anyway , it 's for your own good . That 's all Alvin Junior needed to hear . He nodded his head and did what Pa said , not cause he had no spunk , not cause he was scared of hisp126pa like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to trust his judgment . Simple as that . " I 'll miss you , Pa . " And then he did a crazy fool thing , which if he stopped to think about it he never would 've done . He reached down and tousled his father 's hair . Even while he was doing it , he thought , Pa 's going to slap me silly for treating him like a boy ! Pa 's eyebrows did go up , and he reached up and caught Al Junior 's hand by the wrist . But then he got him a twinkle in his eye and laughed loud and said , " I reckon you can do that once , Son , and live . " Pa was still laughing when he stepped back to give Ma space to say her good-bye . She had tears running down her face , but she did n't have no last-minute list of dos and don'ts for him , the way she had for Measure . She just kissed his hand and clung on to it , and looked him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , I 'll never see you with my natural eyes again , as long as I live . " " No , Ma , do n't say that , " he told her . " Nothing bad 's going to happen to me . " " You just remember me , " she said . " And you keep that amulet I gave you . You wear that all the time . " " What 's it do ? " he asked , taking it from his pocket again . " I do n't know this kind . " " Never you mind , you just keep it close to you all the time . " " I will , Ma . " Measure walked his horse up beside Al Junior 's . " We best be going now , " he said . " We want to get to country we do n't see every day before we bed down tonight . " " Do n't you do that , " said Pa sternly . " We arranged for you to stay with the Peachee family tonight . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Do n't want you to spend a night in the open when you do n't have to . " " All right , all right , " said Measure , " but we at least ought to get there before supper . " " Go on then , " said Ma . " Go on then , boys . " They only got a rod or so on the way before Pa came running out and caught Measure 's horse by the bridle , and Al Junior 's , too . " Boys , you remember ! Cross rivers at the bridges . You hear me ? Only at the bridges ! There'sp127bridges at every river on this road , between here and Hatrack River . " " I know , Pa , " said Measure . " I helped build them all , you know . " " Use them ! That 's all I 'm saying . And if it rains , you stop , you find a house and stop , you hear me ? I do n't want you out in the water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wo n't even stand downstream from the horses when they spurt , " said Measure . Pa shook a finger at him . " Do n't you make light , " he said . Finally they got on their way , not looking back cause that was awful luck , and knowing that Ma and Pa went back into the house well before they was out of sight , cause it was calling for a long separation if you watched a long time when folks were leaving , and if you watched them clear out of sight it was a good chance somebody 'd die before you ever saw them again . Ma took that real serious . Going inside quick like that was the last thing she 'd be able to do to help protect her boys on their way . Al and Measure stopped in a stretch of woods between Hatchs ' and Bjornsons ' farms , where the last storm knocked down a tree half onto the road . They could get by all right , being on horseback as they were , but you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . Maybe somebody in a wagon , hurrying to make home before dark on a stormy night , maybe that 's who 'd come by next , and find the road blocked . So they stopped and ate the lunch Ma packed for them , and then set to work with their hatchets , cutting it free from the few taut strands of wood that clung to the ragged stump . They were wishing for a saw long before they were done , but you do n't carry a saw with you on a three-hundred-mile trip on horseback . A change of clothes , a hatchet , a knife , a musket for hunting , powder and lead , a length of rope , a blanket , and a few odd tokens and amulets for wardings and fendings . Much more than that and you 'd have to bring a wagon or a pack horse . After the trunk was free , they tied both horses to itp128and pulled it out of the way . Hard work , sweaty work , cause the horses were n't used to pulling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snagging up on them , too , and they had to keep rolling it and chopping away branches . Now , Al knew he could 've used his knack to change the wood of that tree inside , to make it split apart in all the right places . But that would n't have been right , he knew . The Shining Man wouldn't 've stood for that  --  it would 've been pure selfishness , pure laziness , and no good to anybody . So he hacked and tugged and sweated right alongside Measure . And it was n't so bad . It was good work , and when it was all done it was no more than an hour . It was time well spent . They talked somewhat during the work , of course . Some of the conversation turned on the stories about Red massacres down south . Measure was pretty skeptical . " Oh , I hear those stories , but the bloody ones are all things somebodyheard from somebody else about somebody else . The folks who actually lived down there and got run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run off their pigs and chickens , that 's all . Not a one ever said nothing about no arrows flying or folks getting killed . " Al , being ten years old , was more inclined to believe the stories , the bloodier the better . " Maybe when they kill somebody , they kill the whole family so nobody talks about it . " " Now you think about it , Al . That do n't make sense . Ta-Kumsaw wants all the White people out of there , do n't he ? So he wants them scared to death , so they pack up and move , do n't he ? So would n't he leave one alive to tell about it , if he was doing massacres ? Would n't somebody'vefound some bodies , at least ? " " Well where do the stories come from , then ? " " Armor-of-God says Harrison 's telling lies , to try to get people het up against the Reds . " " Well , he could n't very well lie about them burning down his house and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could n't they ? And he could n't very well lie about it killing his wife and his little boy , could he ? " " Well of course it did burn , Al . But maybe it wasn'tp129fire arrows from Ta-Kumsaw started that fire . You ever think of that ? " " Governor Harrison is n't going to burn down his own house and kill his own family just so he can get people hot against the Reds , " said Al . " That 's plain dumb . " And they speculated on and on about Red troubles in the south part of the Wobbish country , because that was the most important topic of conversation around , and since nobody knowed anything accurate anyway , everybody 's opinion was as good as anybody else 's . Seeing how they were n't more than a half mile from two different farms , in country they 'd visited four or five times a year for ten years , it never even came to mind they ought to keep their eyes open for trouble . You just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're talking about Red massacres and stories about murders and torture . Fact is , though , careful or not there was n't much they could 've done . Al was coiling ropes and Measure was cinching up the saddles when all of a sudden there was about a dozen Reds around them . One minute nobody but crickets and mice and a bird here and there , the next minuteReds all painted up . It took a few seconds even at that for them to be afraid . There was a lot of Reds in Prophetstown , and they came pretty regular to trade at Armor-of-God 's store . So Alvin spoke before he even hardly looked at them . " Howdy , " said Alvin . They did n't howdy him back . They had paint all over their faces . " These ai n't no howdy Reds , " said Measure softly . " They got muskets . " That made it sure these were n't no Prophetsotwn Reds . The Prophet taught his followers never to use White man 's weapons . A true Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land knew his need , and the game would come near enough to kill with a bow . Only reason for a Red to have a gun , said the Prophet , was to be a murderer , and murdering was for White men . That 's what he said . So it was plain these were n't Reds that put much store in the Prophet.  |p130Alvin  was looking one right in the face . Al must 've showed his fear , cause the Red got a glint in his eye and smiled a little . The Red reached out his hand . " Give him the rope , " said Measure . " It 's our rope , " said Al . As soon as he said it he knew it did n't make no sense . Al handed both ropes to him . The Red took the coils , gentle as you please . Then he tossed one over the White boys ' heads , to another Red , and the whole bunch of them set to work , stripping off the boys ' outer clothes and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their shoulder joints something painful . " Why do they want our clothes ? " Al asked . In answer , one of the Reds slapped him hard across the face . He must 've liked the sound it made , because he slapped him again . The sting of it brought tears to Al 's eyes , but he did n't cry out , partly cause he was so surprised , partly cause it made him mad and he did n't want to give them no satisfaction . Slapping was an idea that caught on real good with the other Reds , cause they started in slapping Measure , too , both of the boys , again and again , till they were half-dazed and their cheeks were bleeding inside and out . One Red babbled something , and they gave him Al 's shirt . He slashed at it with his knife , and then rubbed it on Al 's bleeding face . Must not have got enough blood on it , because he took his knife and slashed right across Al 's forehead . The blood just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al and for the first time he did cry out . It felt like he 'd been laid open right to the bone , and the blood was running down in his eyes so he could n't see . Measure yelled for them to leave Al alone , but there was n't no chance of that . Everybody knew that once a Red started in to cutting on you , you were bound to end up dead . Minute Al cried out and the blood started coming , them Reds started laughing and making little hooting sounds . This bunch was out for real trouble , and Al thought back to all the stories he heard . Most famous one was probably about Dan Boone , a Pennsylvania man who tried to settle in the Crown Colonies for a while . That wasp131back when the Cherriky were against the White man , and one day Dan Boone 's boy got kidnapped . Boone was n't a half hour behind them Reds . It was like they were playing with him . They 'd stop and cut off parts of the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause bad pain and make him scream . Boone heard his boy screaming , and followed , him and his neighbors , armed with their muskets and half-mad with rage . They 'd reach the place where the boy 'd been tortured , and the Reds were gone , not a trace of a track in the wood , and then there 'd come another scream . Twenty miles they went that day , and finally at nightfall they found the boy hanging from three different trees . They say Boone never forgot that , he could never look a Red in the eye after that without thinking on that twenty-mile day . Al had that twenty-mile day on his mind now , too , hearing them Reds laugh , feeling the pain , just the start of the pain , knowing that whatever these Reds were after , they wanted it to start with two dead White boys , and they would n't mind a little noise along the way . Keep still , he told himself . Keep still . They rubbed his slashed-up shirt on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While they were doing that , Al kept his mind on other things . Only time he ever tried to heal himself was that busted leg of his , and then he was lying down , resting , plenty of time to study it out , to find his way to all those small places where there was brokenveins and heal them up , knit together the skin and bone . This time he was a-scared and getting pushed this way and that , not calm , not resting . But he still managed to find the biggest veins and arteries , make them close up . Last time they wiped his face on a shirt , his forehead did n't gush blood down to cover his eyes again . It was still bleeding , but just a trickle now , and Al tipped his head up so the blood would ooze on down his temples , and leave his eyes clear to see . They had n't cut Measure yet . He was looking at Al , and there was a sick look on Measure 's face . Al knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about how Ma and Pa trusted Al into Measure 's keeping , and now look how he let them down . That was crazy , to blamep132himself . They could 've done what they were doing now at any cabin or house in the whole countryside , and were n't nobody could stop them . If Al and Measure had n't been going off on a long trip , they might still have been on this very road at this very time anyhow . But Al could n't say nothing like that to Measure , could n't do much except to smile . Smile and , as best he could , work on healing up his own wound . Making everything in his forehead go back to the way it was supposed to be . He kept at it , finding it easier and easier to do , while he watched what the Reds were doing . They did n't talk much . They pretty much knew what to do . They got the blood-smeared clothes and tied them to the saddles . Then with a knife one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saddle seats , and " Prophet " in the other . For a second Al was surprised that he could write English , but then he saw him checking how he made the letters , comparing them to a paper he had folded up in the waistband of his loincloth . A paper . Then , while two of them held each horse by the bridle , another Red jabbed the horse 's flanks with a knife , little cuts , not all that deep , but enough to make them crazy with pain , kicking out , bucking , rearing up . The horses knocked down the Reds holding them and took off , ran away , heading  --  as the Reds knowed they would  --  on up the road toward home . A message , that 's what it was . These Reds wanted to be followed . They wanted a whole bunch of White folks to get their muskets and horses and follow . Like Daniel Boone in the story . Follow the sound of screaming . Go crazy from the sound of their children dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or die , he and Measure would n't let Reds make his parents hear what Daniel Boone heard . There was n't a chance in the world of them getting away . Even if Al made the rope come apart  --  which he could do easy enough  --  there was n't no way two White boys could outrun Reds in the forest . No , these Reds had them as long as they wanted . But Al knew ways to keep them from doing things top133them . And it would be all right to do it , too , to use his knack , because it would n't just be for himself . It would be for his brother , and for his family , and in a funny way he knew it would be for the Reds , too , because if there was something real , if some White boys really did get tortured to death , then there 'd be a war , there 'd be a real knockdown-drag-outfight between Reds and Whites , and a lot of people on both sides would die . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right for Al to use his knack . With the horses gone , the Reds tied thongs around Al 's and Measure 's necks . Then they pulled on the thongs to drag them along . Measure was a big man , taller than any of the Reds , so as they led him they made him bend over . It was hard for him to run , and the thong was real tight on him . Al was getting pulled along behind him , so he could see how Measure was being treated , could hear him choking a little . It was a simple thing for Al , though , to get inside that thong and stretch it out , stretch it and stretch it , so it was loose around Measure 's neck , and long enough that Measure could run pretty much upright . It happened slow enough that the Reds did n't really notice it . But Al knew that they 'd notice what he was doing soon enough . Everybody knew that Reds did n't leave footprints . And when Reds took White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs like dressed-out deer , so the clumsy White folks would n't leave no tracks . These Reds meant to be followed , then , cause they were letting Al and Measure leave tracks and traces every step they took . But they did n't mean it to be too easy to find them . After they 'd gone forever , it felt like  --  a couple of hoursat least  --  they came to a brook and walked on upstream aways , and then ran on another half mile or maybe a milebefore they finally stopped in a clearing and built a fire . No farms close by , but that did n't mean much . Bynow the horses were home with the bloody clothing andthe wounds in the horses ' flanks and those names carvedinto the saddles . By now every White man in the wholeea was bringing his family in to Vigor Church , where ap134few men could protect them while the rest went out searching for the missing boys . By now Ma was pale with terror , Pa raging for the other men to hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the boys , if you do n't come now I 'll go on alone ! And the others saying , Calm down , calm down , ca n't do no good by yourself , we 'll catch them , you bet . Nobody admitting what they all knew  --  that Al and Measure were as good as dead . But Al did n't plan to be dead . No sir . He planned to be absolutely alive , him and Measure both . The Reds built up the fire good and hot , and it sure was n't no cook fire . Since the sun was shining bright and hard already , it made Al and Measure sweat something awful , even in their short summer underwear . They sweated even more when the Reds cut even that much off them , popping off the buttons down the front and slicing it right down the back , so they were naked right down to the ground they sat on . It was about then that one of the Reds noticed Al 's forehead . He took a big hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing pretty hard to get the dried blood off . Then he started jabbering at the others . They all gathered around to see . Then they checked Measure 's forehead , too . Well , Al knew what they were looking for . And he knew they would n't find it . Cause he had healed up his own forehead without a scar , not a mark on his own face . And of course no mark on Measure , either , since he was n't cut . That 'd make them think a little . But it was n't healing that Al was depending on to save them . It was too hard , too slow they could sure cut faster than Al could heal , and that was the truth . It was a lot faster for him to use that knack he had on things like stone and metal , which was all the same straight through ; living flesh , on the other hand , was complicated with all kinds of little stuff that he had to get right in his head before he could change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reds sat down in front of Measure , brandishing a knife , Al did n't wait for him to start cutting . He got that knife into his head , the steel of the blade  --  White man 's knife , just like they were carryingp135White man 's muskets . He found the edge of it , the point , and flattened it out , smoothed it , rounded it . The Red laid that knife up against Measure 's bare chest and tried to cut . Measure braced himself for the pain to start . But that knife made no more mark on Measure than if it was a spoon . Al almost laughed to see that Red pull his knife away and look at it , try to see what was wrong . He ran the edge against his own finger , to test it ; Al thought of making the blade razor sharp right then , but no , no , the rule was to use his knack to make things right , not to cause injury . The others gathered round to look at the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably thinking he had n't kept the edge sharp . But Al spent that time finding all the other steel edges that those Red men had and makingthem round and smooth . They couldn't 've cut a pea pod in half with them knives when Al was through . Sure enough , all the others pulled out their knives to try them , running the edges against Al or Measure first , and finally yelling and shouting and accusing each other , quarreling over whose fault it was , probably . But they had a job to do , did n't they ? They were supposedto torture these White boys and make them scream , or at least hack them up bad enough that when their folks found the bodies they 'd thirst for revenge . So one of the Reds took his old-fashioned stone-edged tommy-hawk and brandished it in front of Al 's face , wavingit around so he 'd get good and scared . Al used the time to soften up the stone , weaken the wood , loosen the thongs that held it all together . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some real business , like smashing Al in the face with it , it crumbled apart in his hand . The wood was rotted clear through , the stone fell to the ground as gravel , and even the thong was split and frayed through . That Red man shouted and jumped back like as if he had a rattler a-biting at him . Another one had a steel-blade hatchet , and he did n't waste no time waving it around , he just laid out Measure 's hand on a rock and whacked it down , meaning to cut Measure'sfingers off . This was easy stuff to Al , though.  |p136Had  n't he cut whole millstones , when the need was ? So the hatchet struck and rang on the stone , and Measure gasped at the sight of it , sure it 'd take his fingers clean off ; but when the Red picked up the hatchet , there was Measure'shand just like before , not marked a bit , while the hatchet had finger-shaped depressions in the blade , like it was made of cool butter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at each other with fear in their eyes , fear and anger at the strange things going on . Alvin could n't know it , being White , but the thing that made this worst of all for them was they could n't feel it like they felt a White man 's spells or charms or doodles . A White man put a hex , they felt it like a bump in their land-sense ; a beseeching was a nasty stink ; a warding was a buzz when they came close . But this that Alvin did , it did n't interrupt the land at all , their sense of how things ought to be did n't show them nothing different going on . It was like all the natural laws had changed on them , and suddenly steel was soft and flesh was hard , rock was brittle and leather weak as grass . They did n't look to Al or Measure as the cause of what was going on . It was some natural force doing it , as best they could figure . All that Alvin saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him well enough . He was n't cocky , though . He knew there was some things he did n't know how to handle . Water was the main one ; if they took it in their heads to drown the boys , Al would n't know how to stop them , or save himself or Measure . He was only ten , and being bound by rules he did n't understand , he had n't figured out what-all his knack was good for , or how it worked . Maybe there was things within his power that could be right spetackler , if he only knowed how , but the point was he did n't know , and so he only did the things that were within his reach . This much was on his side  --  they did n't think of drowning . But they thought of fire . Most likely they were planning that from the start  --  folks told tales of finding torture victims in the Red wars back in New England , their blackened feet in the cooling ashes of a fire , where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleed/ing and madness of it killed them . Alvin saw them stoking up the fire , putting hot-burning branches on it to make it flare . He did n't know how to take the heat out of a fire , he 'd never tried . So he thought as fast as he could , and while they were picking Measure up by his armpits and dragging him to the fire , Al got inside the firewood and broke it up , made it crumble into dust , so it burnt up fast , all at once , in a fire so fast it made a loud clap and a puff of bright hot light shot upward . It rose so fast that it made a wind blow in from all directions onto the place where the fire had been , and it made a whirlwind for a second or two , whipping around , sucking up the ashes and then puffingthem out to drift down like dust . Just like that , nothing left of the fire at all except dust settling fine as mist all over the clearing . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own shoulders and chests . And while they were carrying on like an Irish funeral , Al loosened the ropes on him and Measure , hoping against hope that they might even get away after all before their folks and neighbors found them and started in with shooting and killing and dying . Measure felt the ropes loosening , of course , and looked sharp at Alvin ; up to then he 'd been almost as crazy with what was happening as the Reds . Of course , he knew right off that it was Alvin doing it , but it was n't as if Alvin could explain what he was planning  --  it took Measureby surprise same as the others . Now , though , he looked at Alvin and nodded , starting to twist his arms out of the ropes . None of the Reds had noticed so far , and maybe they could get a running start , or maybe  --  just maybe  --  the Reds were so upset they would n't even try to follow . Right then , though , everything changed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it got picked up by what sounded like three hundred owls , all in a circle . Measuremust have thought for a second that Al was causing that to happen , too , the way he looked at his little brother  --  but the Reds knew what it was , and stopped their carrying on right away . From the fear on their faces ,  |p138though  , Al figured it must be something good , maybe even something like rescue . From the forest all around the clearing there stepped out dozens , then a hundred Reds . These were all carrying bows  --  not a musket among them  --  and the way they dressed and had their hair , Al reckoned them to be ShawNee , and followers of the Prophet . It was about the last thing Al expected , truth to tell . It was White faces he wanted to see , not more Red ones . One Red stepped out of the mass of the newcomers , a tall strong man with a face as hard and sharp as stone , it looked like . He fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captors began babbling , jabbering , pleading . It was like a bunch of children , Al thought , doing something they knew they should n't ought to , and then their pa comes along and catches them at it . Having been caught in such mischief himself sometimes , he almost felt a little sympathy , till he remembered that what his captors had had in mind was cruel death for him and his brother . Just because they ended up without a scratch did n't mean them Reds were n't guilty of the bad intent . Then one word stuck out of all the yammering  --  a name : Ta-Kumsaw . Al looked at Measure to see if he 'd heard , and Measure was looking at him , raising his eyebrows , asking the same thing . They both mouthed the name at the same time . Ta-Kumsaw . Did this mean Ta-Kumsaw was in charge of all this ? Was he angry at the captors because they failed at the torture , or because they 'd captured White boys at all ? There was n't no explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al could know for sure was what they did . The newcomeReds took all the muskets away from the gun-toters , and then led them off into the woods . Only about a dozen Reds stayed with Al and Measure . Among them was TaKumsaw . " They say you have fingers made of steel , " said TaKumsaw . Measure looked at Al for him to answer , and Al could n't think of anything to say . He was sure reluctant about telling this Red what it was he done . So it was Mea/sure answered him after all , by raising his hands and wigglinghis fingers . " Just regular fingers near as I can tell , " he said . Ta-Kumsaw reached out and took him by the hand  --  a strong , hard grip , it must have been , cause Measure tried to pull away and could n't . " Iron skin , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Ca n't cut with knife . Ca n't burn . Boys made of stone . " He pulled Measure up to a standing position and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the arm . " Stone boy , throw me on the dirt ! " " I ca n't wrassle you , " said Measure . " I do n't want a fight with nobody . " " Throw me ! " commanded Ta-Kumsaw . And he adjustedhis grip , put out his foot , and waited until Measure put out his own foot to join him . Facing off , man to man , the way the Reds did in their games . Only this was n't no game , not to these boys who 'd been looking death in the face and did n't have no guarantee that it still was n't just around the corner . Al did n't know what he ought to do , but he was in a mood for doing something , coming on the heels of all his changing of things . So it was almost without a thought of the consequences that the very moment Measure and TaKumsawstarted to push and pull on each other , Al made the dirt come all loose under Ta-Kumsaw 's feet , so his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other Reds had been kind of laughing and joshing about the wrassle , but when they saw the greatest chief of all the tribes , a man whose name was known from Boston to New Orleans , when they saw him smash on the ground like that they kind of left off laughing . Truth to tell there was n't a sound in that clearing . Ta-Kumsaw picked himself up and looked at the dirt under his feet , scraping on it with his foot . It was solid enough now , of course . But he stepped a few feet away , onto the grass , and held out his hand again . This time Measure had a little more confidence , and reached out to take his hand  --  but at the last second , TaKumsawsnatched his own hand away . He stood very still , not looking at Measure or Al or anybody , just looking into space , his face all hard and set . Then he turned to thep140other Reds and fired off a volley of words , spitting them out with all the Ss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other children of Vigor Church used to imitate Red talk by saying things like " boxy talksy skock woxity " and laughing till their sides ached . But it did n't sound too funny the way Ta-Kumsaw said it , and when he was done Al and Measure found themselves getting pulled along by them thongs again . And when the rags of their underjohns fell down and started tripping them up , Ta-Kumsaw came back and tore them off the boys , ripping that fabric to shreds with his bare hands , his face all angry . Neither Al nor Measure felt like mentioning that they was left pretty near naked by this time , considering that the only wearing apparel left on them was the thong around their neck ; it just did n't seem like a good time to complain . Where TaKumsawwas taking them they had no idea , and since they also had no choice about going , there was n't much point in asking , either . Al and Measure never ran so long or so far in their lives . Hour after hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never stopping , neither . Moving like this , a Red could travel faster on foot than a White usually could on horseback , unless he was making his nag run all the way . Which was n't too good on the horse . And the horse had to stay on cleared roads . While Reds  --  Reds did n't even need a path . Al noticed real quick that running through the woods was different for the Reds than it was for him and Measure . The only sound he heard was his and Measure 's footfalls . Al being near the back , he could see how things went with Measure . The Red who was pulling Measure would push a branch with his body , and the branch would bend to make way . But the next second when Measure tried to push through , it would snatch at his skin and then break off . Reds would step on roots or twigs and there 'd be no sound , nothing snagging their feet ; Al would step on the same spot , and he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or the twig would snap under his bare foot , or the rough bark of the root would tear at his skin . Al , on account of being just a boy , was used to walking around barefoot a good deal of the time , so the soles of his feetp141were somewhat toughened up . But Measure 'd been in growed-man 's boots for some years now , and Al could see that after maybe half a mile Measure was bleeding . One thing he could do , Al reckoned , was help his brother 's feet to heal up . He tried to start , to find his way into his brother 's body the way he 'd found his way into the stone and the steel and the wood . Running along like that , though , it was hard to concentrate . And living flesh was just too complicated . Al was n't the kind to give up . No , he just tried a different way . Since it was running that distracted him , he just quit thinking about running . Did n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red ahead of him stepped , just did n't think about it at all . Like trimming an oil lamp , he trimmed his own wick , as they say , letting his eyes focus on nothing , thinking about nothing , letting his body work like a pet animal that could be let to have its own head and go its own way . He had no notion that he was doing what doodlebugs do , when they let their bug go out of their head and travel on its own . And anyway it was n't the same , on account of there was n't no doodlebug in the natural world who ever tried to doodle while he was running with a thong around his neck . Now , though , he did n't have a speck of trouble getting into Measure 's body , finding the sore places , the bleeding cuts on his feet , the ache in his legs , the pain in his side . Healing the feet , toughing them up , callusing them , that was easy enough . For the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathe more , deeper , faster ; so Al got into his lungs and cleared them , opened them into the deepest places . Now when Measure sucked in air , his body got more of a use out of it , like it could wring out each rag of air to get the very last drop of good out of it . Al did n't even half understand what he was doing  --  but he knowed it worked , cause the pain in Measure'sbody began to ease , he did n't weary so much , he did n't gasp for breath . As he returned to himself , Al noticed that in the whole time he was helping Measure , he did n't step on no twig that broke or get smacked by some snaggy branchp142flipping back from the Red in front of him . Now , though , he was getting poked and tripped and snapped as much as ever . He thought right off , it was happening just the same all along , only I did n't hardly notice cause I was n't rightly paying attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was true and even mostly believed it , he also realized that the sound of the world had changed . Now it was just breathing and pale-skinned feet thumping on the dirt or swishing through ancient dead leaves . A bird sound now and then , a fly buzzing . Nothing remarkable , except that Al could remember , just as plain as anything , that until he came back from fixing up Measure 's body he could hear something else , a kind of music , a kind of  --  green music . Well , that did n't make no sense . There was n't no way music could have a color to it , that was plain crazy . So Al put that out of his mind , just did n't think about it . Without thinking about it , though , he was still longing to hear it again . Hear it or see it or smell it , however it came into him , he wanted it back again . And one more little thing . Until he went out of himself to help Measure , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fact he was near wore out . But now he was all right , his body was doing fine , he was breathing deep , his legs and arms felt like he could go on forever , sturdy in their motion as trees were in their stillness . Now maybe that was because in healing Measure , he also somehowhealed himself  --  but he did n't rightly believe that , cause he always knew what he did and what he did n't do . No , to Al Junior 's thinking , his body was doing better because of something else . And that something else , either it was part of the green music , or it caused the music , or they both were caused by the same thing . As near as Al could figure . Running along like that , Al and Measure did n't have no chance to talk till getting on nightfall , when they came to a Red village on the curve of a dark deep river . TaKumsawled them right into the middle of the village and then walked off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them , maybe a hundred yards of grassy ground.  | " Think we could make it down to the river without them catching us ? " whispered Measure . " No , " said Al . " And anyways I ca n't swim . Pa never let me near the water . " Then all the Red women and children come out of the stick-and-mud huts they lived in and pointed at them two naked Whites , man and boy , and laughed and threw sods at them . At first Al and Measure tried to dodge , but it just made them laugh harder and run around and around , throwing wet dirt from different angles , trying to catch them in the face or the crotch . Finally Measure just sat down on the grass , put his face to his knees , and let them throw all they wanted . Al did the same . Finally somebody barked a few words and the sod-throwing stopped . Al looked up in time to see Ta-Kumsaw walking away , and a couple of his fighting men come out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the farthest I ever run in my whole life , " said Measure . " Me too , " said Al . " Right at the start there I thought I was like to die , I was so tired , " said Measure . " Then I got my second wind . I did n't think I had it in me . " Al did n't say nothing . " Or did you have something to do with that ? " " Maybe some , " said Al . " I never know what you can do , Alvin . " " Me neither , " said Al , and it was the truth . " When that hatchet come down on my fingers Ithought that was the end of my working days . " " Just be glad they did n't try to drownd us . " " You and water again , " said Measure . " Well I'mglad you done what you done , Al . Though I will say itmight 've worked out better if you had n't made the chiefslip like that when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Al . " I did n't want him to hurt you  --  " " There 's no way you should know it , Al , so do n't blame yourself . But that kind of wrassling ai n't to hurt a body , it 's kind of a test . Of manliness and quickness andp144what all . If he beat me , but I put up a fair fight , then I 'd have his respect , and if I beat him fair , why , there 's respectin that , too . Armor told me about it . They do it all the time . " Alvin thought about this . " So when I made him fall , was that real bad ? " " I do n't know . Depends on why they think it happened . Might be they 'll think it means that God is on my side or something . " " Do they believe in God ? " " They 've got a Prophet , do n't they ? Just like in the Bible . Anyway I just hope they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things wo n't go so good for me then . " " Well I 'll tell them it was me done it , " said Al . " Do n't you dare , " said Measure . " The only thing saved us was they did n't know it was you doing them changes on the knives and hatchets and such . If they knowed it was you , Al , they would 've hacked your head open , mashed you flat and then done what they wanted with me . Only thing that saved you was they did n't know what was causing it . " Then they got to talking about how worried Pa and Ma would be , speculating on how Ma would be so mad , or maybe she 'd be too worried to be angry at Pa , and there must be men out looking for them by now even if the horses never came home , cause when they did n't show up for supper at the Peachees they would n't waste a minute giving the warning . " They 'll be talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that much  --  there 's plenty of folks from down Carthage way who hate Ta-Kumsaw already , from his running off their livestock earlier this year . " " But it was Ta-Kumsaw who saved us , " said Al . " Or that 's how it looks , anyway . But I notice he did n't take us home , or even ask us where home was . And how did he happen to come along right at that very minute , if he was n't part of it himself ? No , Al , I do n't know what 's going on , but Ta-Kumsaw did n't save us , or if he did he saved us for his own reasons , and I do n't know as how I trust him to do good for us . For one thing , I reallyp145ai n't much for setting around naked in the middle of a Red village . " " Me neither . And I 'm hungry . " It was n't long , though , before Ta-Kumsaw himself came out with a pot of corn mash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who carried himself like a king , toting a pot like one of the Red women . But after that first surprise , Al realized that when Ta-Kumsaw did it , pottotinglooked downright noble . He set down the pot in front of Al and Measure , and then took a couple of strips of Red-weave cloth from around his neck . " Wrap up , " he said , and handed each of them a strip . Neither one of them knowed the first thing about tying on a loincloth , beginning with the fact that Ta-Kumsaw was still holding the deerskin belts that were supposed to hold them on . Ta-Kumsaw laughed at how confused they were , and then made Al stand up . He dressed Al himself , and that showed Measure how it was done so he could cover himself , too . It was n't like proper clothes , but it was sure better than being buck naked . Then Ta-Kumsaw sat down on the grass , the pot between him and them , and showed them how to eat the mash  --  dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glop of it and smacking it into his open mouth . Tasted so bland that Alvin like to gagged on it . Measure saw it , and said , " Eat . " So Alvin ate , and once he got some swallowedhe could feel how much his belly wanted more , even though it still took real persuasion to get his throat to take on the job of transportation . When they had the pot cleaned right down to the bottom , Ta-Kumsaw set it aside . He looked at Measure for a while . " How did you make me fall down , White coward ? " he said . Al was all for speaking up right then , but Measure answered too quick and loud . " I ai n't no coward , Chief Ta-Kumsaw , and if you wrassle me now it 'll be fair and square . " Ta-Kumsaw smiled grimly . " So you can make me fall down with all these women and children watching ? " " It was me , " said Alvin . ' Fa-Kumsaw turned his head , slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , neither . " Very small boy , " he said . " Very worthless child . You can make the ground loose under my feet ? " " I just got a knack , " said Alvin . " I did n't know you were n't aiming to hurt him . " " I saw a hatchet , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Finger-marks like this . " He waved his finger to show the kind of pattern Measure 's fingers had left in the blade of the hatchet . " You did that ? " " It ai n't right to cut a man 's fingers off . " Ta-Kumsaw laughed out loud . " Very good ! " Then he leaned in close . " White men 's knacks , they make noise , very much noise . But you , what you do is so quiet nobody sees it . " Al did n't know what he was talking about . In the silence , Measure spoke up bold as you please . " What you plan to do with us , Chief Ta-Kumsaw ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well why do n't you think about letting us run towardhome ? There 's got to be a hundred of our neighbors out now , mad as hornets . There 's going to be a lot of trouble if you do n't let us go home . " Ta-Kumsaw shook his head . " My brother wants you . " Measure looked at Alvin , then back at Ta-Kumsaw . " You mean the Prophet ? " " Tenskwa-Tawa , " said Ta-Kumsaw . Measure looked plain sick . " You mean after he built up his Prophetstown for four years , nobody causing him a lick of trouble , White man and Red man getting along real good , now he goes around taking Whites captive and torturingthem and  --  " Ta-Kumsaw clapped his hands once , loudly . Measure fell silent . " Chok-Taw took you ! Chok-Taw tried to kill you ! My people do n't kill except to defend our land and our families from White thieves and murderers . And Tenskwa-Tawa 's people , they do n't kill at all . " That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta-Kumsaw 's people and the Prophet 's people . " Then how 'd you know where we were ? " demanded Measure . " How 'd you know how to find us ? "  | " Tenskwa-Tawa saw you , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Told me to hurry and get you , save you from the Chok-Taw , bring you to Mizogan . " Measure , who knew more about Armor-of-God 's maps than Alvin did , recognized the name . " That 's the big lake , where Fort Chicago is . " " We do n't go to Fort Chicago , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " We go to the holy place . " " A church ? " asked Alvin . Ta-Kumsaw laughed . " You White people , when you make a place holy you build walls so nothing of the land can get in . Your god is nothing and nowhere , so you build a church with nothing alive inside , a church that could be anywhere , it does n't matter  --  nothing and nowhere . " " Well what does make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where the Red man talks to the land , and the land answers . " Ta-Kumsaw grinned . " Sleep now . We will go when it 's still dark . " " It 's going to be mighty cool tonight , " said Measure . " Women will bring you blankets . Warriors do n't need them . This is summer . " Ta-Kumsaw walked a few steps away , then turned back to Alvin . " Weaw-Moxiky ran behind you , White boy . He saw what you did . Do n't try to keep the secret from Tenskwa-Tawa . He will know when you lie . " Then the chief was gone . " What 's he talking about ? " asked Measure . " I wisht I knew , " said Al . " I 'm going to have troubletelling the truth when I do n't know what the truth is . " The blankets came soon enough . Al snuggled close to his big brother , for courage more than warmth . He and Measure whispered awhile , trying to puzzle things out . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how come them Chok-Taw cut his and the Prophet 's names into the saddle ? And even if that was a lie , it was going to look real bad that Ta-Kumsaw finally did end up with the captives , and then up and took them to Lake Mizogan instead of just letting them go home . It was going to take some tall talking to keep this from turning into a war . Finally , though , they fell silent , weary to the bone from all their running , not to mention their work moving the tree and the plain terror when the Chok-Taw was out top148torture them . Measure started snoring lightly . And Alvin , he found himself drifting . In the very last moments before sleep , he heard that green music again , or saw it , or anyhowknew that it was there . But before he could even listen , he dozed off . Dozed off and slept real peaceful , what with the night breeze blowing cool off the river , the blanket and the warmth of Measure 's body keeping him warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hungryinfant from a hut somewhere ; all of it was part of the green music flowing through his head.  |p149THEY  GATHERED in the clearing , some thirty White men , grim-faced and angry and tired from walking through the woods . The trail was easy enough to follow , but it seemed like the branches grabbed at them and the roots tripped them up  --  the forest was never kind to a White man . Then there was an hour lost when the trail reached a stream , and they had to go up and down the stream to find where the Reds took them boys out of the water and up onto land again . Old Alvin Miller like to went crazy when he saw they dragged the boys through water  --  it took his son Calm about ten minutes to get him quiet and able to go on . The man was just mad with fear . " Shouldn't 've sent him away , I never should 've let him go , " he kept saying . And Calm kept saying , " Could 've happened anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , they 're still walking ai n't they ? " All kinds of talk , but mostly it was his voice that soothed Al Miller , it was his manner  --  some folks even said it was his knack , that his ma named him straight for what he could best do . Now they were in the clearing , and trails led off about five different ways , and all of them plumb disappeared after a few steps . They found the boys ' tore-up underwear a few steps into the woods heading northwest . Nobody figured they ought to show that to Al Miller , so by the time he got there  --  him bringing up the rear at that point ,  |p150with  Calm by his side  --  the underjohns were tucked away out of sight . " We 'll never track them from here , " said Armor-ofGod . " The boys are n't leaving no footprints now  --  which do n't mean nothing , Mr. Miller , so do n't you fret . " Armorcalled his father-in-law Mr. Miller ever since Al throwed him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Al Junior was dying cause the family committedthe sin of using hexes and beseechings . It just do n't seem right to call a man Pa after he heaves you off his porch . " They might be toting the boys , or they might be stepping after them , kind of wiping out their prints . We all know if a Red do n't want to leave a trail , there ai n't no trail . " " We all know about Reds , " said Al Miller . " And what they do to White boys when they  --  " " So far all we know is they 're trying to scare us , " said Armor . " Doing a good job so far , " said one of the Swedes . " Scared mostly to death , my family and me . " " Besides , everybody knows Armor-of-God here is a Red-lover . " Armor looked around , trying to see who said that . " If by Red-lover you mean I think Reds are human beings just like Whites , then it 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whites , then you best work up some courage to step out here and say it to my face , so I can mash your face into the bark of a tree . " " No need to quarrel , " said Reverend Thrower , panting . He was n't much for exercise , was Thrower , so he only just now caught up with the rest of them . " The Lord God loves all his children , even the heathens . Armor-ofGodis a good Christian . But we all know that if it ever comes to fighting between Christian and heathen , Armorof-Godwill stand on the side of righteousness . " The crowd murmured their agreement . After all , they all liked Armor ; he 'd loaned most of them money or given them credit at his store , and never nagged them for payment  --  agood many of them might not have made it through their first few years in Wobbish country if it was n't for Armor . Grateful or not , though , they all knewp151he treated Reds like they was almost White , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's coming to fighting right now , " said a man . " We do n't have to track down these Reds . We got their names on the saddles , carved right in . " " Now just wait a minute ! " said Armor-of-God . " You just think a minute ! In all this time Prophetstown 's been a-growing there across the Wobbish from Vigor Church , has any Red so much as stole a thing from you ? Slapped one of your children ? Snatched a pig ? Done any single bad thing to any one of you ? " " I think stealing Al Miller 's boys is a pretty bad thing ! " said a man . " I 'm talking about the Reds in Prophetstown ! You know they never done nothing wrong , you know that ! And you know why , too . You know it 's cause the Prophet tells them to live in peace , keep to their own land and do no harm to the White man . " " That ai n't what Ta-Kumsaw says ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some terrible crime against White folks  --  which I ai n't saying  --  is there any one of you thinks Ta-Kumsaw or Tenskwa-Tawa is so blamed stupid he 's going to sign his name ? " " They 're proud of killing White folks ! " " If the Red man was smart , he 'd be White ! " " See what I mean about Red-lovers ? " Armor-of-God knew these people , and he knew that most of them were still with him . Even the grumblers were n't about to go off half-cocked ; they 'd sit tight until the whole group decided on action . So let them call him a Red-lover , that was fine , when men was scared and mad they said things that later they repented of . As long as they waited . As long as they did n't jump into war against the Reds . Cause Armor had his suspicions about this whole thing . It was just too easy , the way them horses was sent on home with names carved in the saddle . It was n't the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you soon as look at you . Armor knew enough about Reds to know they only tortured to give a man a chance to show hrave. not to terrorize people . ( Or most Reds , anyway  --   |p152there  were stories about the Irrakwa before they got civilized . ) So whoever did this was n't acting like a natural Red . Armor was near convinced it was a hired-out job . The French in Detroit had been trying to cause war betweenReds and American settlers for years  --  it might 've been them . And it might have been Bill Harrison . Oh yes , it might well have been that man , down there like a spider in his fort on the Hio . Armor thought that was the most likely thing . Course he would n't dare to say it out loud , cause folks would think he was just jealous of Bill Harrison , which was true  --  he was jealous . But he also knew that Harrison was a wicked man , who 'd do anything to make things go his way . Maybe even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few White boys near Prophetstown . After all , it was Tenskwa-Tawa who got most of the Reds from Harrison 's part of the country to lay off whisky and come to Prophetstown . And it was Ta-Kumsaw who ran off half the White settlers down there . It looked to Armor like Harrison was behind this , a lot more likely than the French . But he could n't say none of this , " cause there was no proof . He just had to try to keep things calm , till some real evidence showed up . Which might be right now . They 'd brought along old Tack Sweeper , wheezing his way with the best of them  --  it was remarkable how vigorous he was , for a man whose lungs sounded like a baby 's rattle when he breathed . Tack Sweeper had him a knack , which was n't all that reliable , he was the first to say . But sometimes it worked remarkablewell . What he did was stand around in a place for a while with his eyes closed and sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just quick little visions , a few faces . Like that time they was afraid maybe Jan de Vries killed hisself on purpose , or maybe was murdered , Tack was able to see how it was an accident when his gun went off in his own face , so they could bury him in the churchyardand not have to worry about hunting for no killer . So the hope was Tack could tell them something about what happened in this clearing . He shooed them all back to the edges of the wood , so they 'd be out of the way . Then he walked around in the middle , his eyesp153closed , moving slow . " You boys should n't have got so mad here , " he said after a while . " All I can see is you all jawing . " They laughed , kind of embarrassed . They should 've knowed better than to mess up the memories of a place before Tack got there . " It do n't look good . I keep seeing them Red faces . Knife , all kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatchet falling . " Al Miller moaned . " It 's all just a mess here , so much happened , " said Tack . " I ca n't see right . No . No , I can  --  one man . A Red man , I know his face , I seen him  --  he 's just standing there , just still as you please , I know that face . " " Who is it ? " said Armor-of-God . But he knew , he had that sickening feeling of dread , oh he knew . " Ta-Kumsaw , " said Tack . He opened his eyes wide and looked at Atmor , almost apologetic . " I wouldn't 've believed it either , Armor , " he said . " I always kind of thought Ta-Kumsaw was the bravest man I ever knew . But he was here , and he was in charge . I see him standing there , and telling people what to do . He stood right here . I can see him so clear cause there was n't nobody else stood exactly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ai n't no mistake about it . " Armor believed it . They all did  --  they all knew Tack was a truthful man , and if he said he was sure , then he was sure . But there had to be some reason . " Maybe he come and saved the boys , did you think of that ? Maybe he come and stopped some band of wild Reds from  --  " " Red-lover ! " somebody shouted . " You know Ta-Kumsaw ! He 's no coward , and stealingthem boys was a cowardly thing to do , you know that man ! " " Nobody ever knows a Red man . " " Ta-Kumsaw did n't take those boys ! " insisted Armor-of-God . " I know it ! " Then everybody fell silent , cause old Al Miller was pushing his way forward , out to where Armor-of-God was standing . Faced down his son-in-law , he did , with a face like living hell he was so mad . " You do n't know nothing , Armor-of-God Weaver . You are the most worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First you married my daughter and would n't let her work no hexes cause you were so cock-eyed sure it was the devil 's work . Then you let all these Reds stay around here all the time . And when we thought of building a stockade you said , No , if we build a stockade that just gives them French something to attack and burn down , we 'll be friends with the Reds and then they 'll leave us alone , we 'll trade with the Reds . Well look what it got us ! Look what you done for us ! Ai n't we all glad we listened to you now ! I do n't think you 're no Red-lover , Armor-of-God , I just think you 're the blamedest fool ever to cross the Hio and come out west , and the only folks dumber than you is us if we listen to you for another minute ! " Then Al Miller turned to face the other men , who were looking at him with awe in their face like they just seen majesty for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armor 's way for ten years here . But I 've done with that . I lost one boy in the Hatrack River on my way here , and this town is named for him . Now I lost two other boys . I only got me five sons left , but I tell you I 'll put guns in their hands myself , and lead them all into the middle of Prophetstown and blast them Reds into hell , even if it means we all die ! You hear me ? " They heard him , oh yes they did . They heard and shouted back . This was the word they wanted right now , the word of hate and anger and revenge , and nobody better to give it to them than Al Miller , who was normally a peaceable man , never picked a quarrel with nobody . Him being the father of the captured boys just made it all the stronger when he spoke . " The way I see it , " said Al Miller , " Bill Harrison was right all along . Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can share this land . And I tell you something else . It ai n't me that 's leaving . There 's too much blood of mine been shed here now for me to pack up and go away . I 'm staying , either on this land or in it . " Me too , said all them boys . That 's the truth , Al Miller . We 're staying . " Thanks to Armor here , we got no stockade and we got no U.S. Army fort closer than Carthage City . If wep155fight right now , we might lose everything and everybody . So let 's hold off the Reds as best we can and send for help . A dozen men down to Carthage City and beg Bill Harrison to send us up an army , and maybe bring his cannonif he can . My two boys are gone , and a thousand Reds for each of my sons wo n't be enough getting even for me ! " The dozen riders set on their way south first thing the next morning . They left from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more families from outlyingfarms came in to town to put up with close-in friends and kinfolk . But Al Miller was n't there to see them off . Yesterday his words set them all in motion , but that was all the leadership they 'd get from him . He did n't want to be in charge . He just wanted his boys back . In the church , Armor-of-God sat on the front pew , despondent . " We 're making the most terrible mistake , " he said to Reverend Thrower . " That 's what men do , " said Thrower , " when they make their decisions without the help of the Lord . " " It was n't Ta-Kumsaw , I know it . Nor the Prophet either . " " He 's no Prophet , not of God , anyway , " said Thrower . " He 's no killer , either , " said Armor . " Maybe Tack was right , maybe somehow Ta-Kumsaw 's got something to do with this . But I know one thing . Ta-Kumsaw 's no killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Wayne 's war , there was a bunch of Reds all set to burn a bunch of captives to death , the way they did in those days  --  Chippy-Wa , I think they were . And along comes Ta-Kumsaw , all by himself , just this one lone Shaw-Nee , and he makes them stop . We want the White man to respectus , to treat us as a nation , he says to them . White man wo n't respect us if we act like this ! We got to be civilized . No scalps , no torture , no burning , no killing captives . That 's what he says to them . He 's stuck to that ever since . He kills in battle , yes , but in all his raids down south he did n't kill one soul , do you realize that ? If Ta/Kumsaw 's got them boys , then they 're as safe as if their mama had them home in bed . " Thrower sighed . " I suppose you know these Reds better than I do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly . " So they call me a Red-lover and do n't listen to a word I say . Now they 're calling for that whisky-dealing tyrant from Carthage City to come up here and take over . No matter what he does he 'll be a hero . They 'll make him governor for real , then . Heck , they 'll probably make him President , if Wobbish ever joins the U.S.A. " " I do n't know this Harrison . He ca n't be the devil you make him out to be . " Armor laughed . " Sometimes , Reverend , I think you are as trusting as a little child . " " Which is how the Lord told us to be . Armor-of-God , be patient . All things will work out as the Lord intends . " Armor buried his face in his hands . " I sure hope so , Reverend . I sure do . But I keep thinking about Measure , as good a man as you can hope to find , and that boy Alvin , that sweet-faced boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  " Thrower 's face went grim . " Alvin Junior , " he muttered . " Who would have imagined that the Lord would do his work through the hands of heathens ? " " What are you talking about ? " asked Armor . " Nothing , Armor , nothing . Just that everything about this may be exactly , exactly what the Lord intends . " Up the hill at the Miller house , Al still sat at the breakfast table . He did n't eat no supper the night before , and when he tried to eat breakfast he like to gagged on the food . Faith cleared it all away , and now she stood behind him , rubbing his shoulders . She never once said to him , I told you not to send them . But they both knew it . It hung between them like a sword , and neither dared reach out to the other for fear of it . The silence broke when Wastenot came in , a rifle over his shoulder . He set it beside the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at his parents . " They 're gone , down to fetch the army . "  |p157To  his surprise , his father only lowered his head and rested it on his arms , which were crossed on the table . Mother looked at him , her face haggard with worry and grief . " Since when did you learn how to use that thing ? " " Me and Wantnot been practicing , " he said . " And you 're going to kill Reds with it ? " Wastenot was surprised at the loathing in her voice . " I sure hope so , " he said . " And when all the Reds are dead , and you pile all their bodies together , will Measure and Alvin somehow wriggle out of that pile and come on home to me ? " Wastenot shook his head . " Last night some Red went home to his family , all proud because he killed him some White boys yesterday . " Her voice caught when she said it , but she went on all the same , cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And maybe his wife or his mama patted him and kissed him and made him supper . But do n't you ever walk through that door and tell me you killed a Red man . Cause you wo n't get no supper , boy , and you wo n't get no kiss , and you wo n't get no pat , and no word , and no home , and no mama , you hear me ? " He heard , all right , but he did n't like it . He stood up and walked back to the door and picked up the gun . " You think what you like , Mama , " he said , " but this is a war , and I am going to kill me some Reds , and I 'm going to come back home , and I 'm going to own up to it proud as can be . And if that means you do n't want to be my mama no more , then you might as well stop being my mama now , and not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but stopped before slamming it shut behind him . " Cheer up , Mama . Maybe I wo n't come back at all . " He never talked that way to his mother in his life , and he was n't real sure that it felt good to do it now . But she was being crazy , not understanding that it was war now , that them Reds had declared it open season on White folks and so there was n't no more choice about it . What bothered him most , though , as he got on his horse and rode out to David 's place , was that he couldn'tp158exactly be sure but he thought , he just suspected anyway , that Papa was crying . If that did n't beat all . Yesterday Papa was so hot against the Reds , and now Mama talked against fighting , and Papa just sat there and cried . Maybe it was getting old that made Papa like that . But that was n't Wastenot 's business , not now . Maybe Papa and Mama did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was going to do to them as took his brothers . Their blood was his blood , and whoever shed his blood was going to shed some of their own , too , a gallon for every drop.  |p159IN  HIS WHOLE LIFE Alvin never saw so much water all in one place . He stood on the top of a sand dune , looking out over the lake . Measure stood beside him , a hand resting on Al 's shoulder . " Pa told me to keep you away from water , " said Measure , " and now look where they bring you . " The wind was hot and hard , gusting sometimes and shooting sand around like tiny arrows . " Brought you , too , " said Al . " Look , there 's a real storm coming . " Off in the southwest , the clouds got black and ugly . Not one of them summer-shower storms . Lightning crackled along the face of the clouds . The thunder came much later , muffled by distance . While Alvin was watching , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther than before , like he could see the twisting and churning in the clouds , feel the hot and cold of it , the icy air swooping down , the hot air shooting upward , all writhing in a vast circle of the sky . " Tornado , " said Al . " There 's a tornado in that storm . " " I do n't see one , " said Measure . " It 's coming . Look how the air is spinning there . I.00k at that . " " I believe you , Al . But it 's not like there 's any place to hide around here . "  | " Look at all these people , " said Alvin . " If it hits us here  --  " " When did you learn how to tell the weather ? " asked Measure . " You never done that before . " Al did n't have an answer to that . He never had felt a storm inside himself like this . It was like the green music he 'd heard last night , all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Reds . But he could n't waste another minute trying to think about why he knew  --  it was enough that he knew it . " I 've got to warn some-body . " Alvin took off down the dune , sliding so that each step was like leaping off the face of the hill , then landing on one foot and leaping again . He 'd never run downhill so fast before . Measure chased after him , shouting , " They told us to stay up there till  --  " The wind gusted and whipped away his words . Now they were off the hill , the sand was even worse ; the wind lifted big sheets of sand off the dunes , hurled it a ways , then let it fall . Al had to close his eyes , shield them with his hand , turn his face out of the wind  --  whatever it took to keep the sand from blinding him as he ran to the group of Reds gathered at the edge of the water . Ta-Kumsaw was easy to spot , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a space around him , and he stood there like a king . Al ran right up to him . " Tornadocoming ! " he yelled . " There 's tornadoes in that cloud ! " Ta-Kumsaw leaned his head back and laughed ; the wind was so loud Al barely heard him . Then Ta-Kumsaw reached over Al 's head , to touch the shoulder of another Red standing there . " This is the boy ! " shouted Ta-Kumsaw . Al looked at the man Ta-Kumsaw touched . He did n't carry himself like a king at all  --  nothing like Ta-Kumsaw . He was stooped somewhat , and one eye was missing , the lid just hanging empty over nothing . He looked taut , his arms wiry rather than muscled , his legs downright scrawny . But as Al sat there looking up into his face , he knew him . There was n't no mistake . The wind died down for just a minute.  | " Shining Man , " said Al . " Roach boy , " said Tenskwa-Tawa , Lolla-Wossiky , the Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a dream , not a vision . A real man who had stood there at the foot of his bed , vanishingand reappearing , his face shining like sunlight so it hurt to look at him . But it was the same man . " I did n't heal you ! " said Al . " I 'm sorry . " " Yes you did , " said the Prophet . Then Al remembered why he 'd come running down the dune , busting into a conversation between the two greatest Reds in the whole world , these brothers whose names were known to every White man , woman , and child west of the Appalachee Mountains . " Tornadoes ! " he said . As if to answer him , the wind whipped up again , howling now . Al turned around , and what he 'd seen and felt was coming true . There were four twisters forming , hanging down out of the storm like snakes hanging from trees , slithering lower toward the ground , their heads ready to strike . They were all four coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now ! " shouted the Prophet . Ta-Kumsaw handed his brother a flint-tipped arrow . The Prophet sat down in the sand and jammed the point of the arrow into the sole of his left foot , then his right foot . Blood oozed copiously from the wounds . Then he did the same to his hands , jabbing himself so deep in the palm that it was bleeding on the top side of his hands , too . Almost without thinking , Al cried out and started to cast his mind into the Prophet 's body , to heal the wounds . " No ! " cried the Prophet . " This is the power of the Red man  --  the blood of his body  --  the fire of the land ! " Then he turned and started walking out into Lake Mizogan . I No , not into the lake . Onto it . Alvin could n't hardly believe it , but under the Prophet 's bloody feet the water became smooth and flat as glass , and the Prophet was standing on it . His blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards away , the water became loose and choppy , wind-whipped waves rushing toward the smooth place and then just flattening , calming , becoming smooth.  |p162The  Prophet kept walking , farther out onto the water , his bloody footprints marking the smooth path through the storm . Al looked back at the tornadoes . They were close now , almost overhead . Al could feel them twisting inside him , as if he were part of the clouds , and these were the great raging emotions of his own soul . Out on the water , the Prophet raised his hands and pointed at one of the twisters . Almost immediately , the other three twisters rose up , sucked back up into the clouds and disappeared . But the other came nearer , until it was directly over the Prophet , maybe a hundred feet up . It was near enough that around the edges of the Prophet 's glassy smooth path , the water was leaping up , as if it wanted to dive upward into the clouds ; the water started to circle , too , twisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come ! " shouted the Prophet . Alvin could n't hear him , but he saw his eyes  --  even from that far away  --  saw his lips move , and knew what the Prophet wanted . Alvin did n't hesitate . He stepped out onto the water . By now , of course , Measure was caught up with him , and when Al started walking onto the warm , smooth glass of the Prophet 's path , Measure shouted at him , grabbed at him . Before he could touch the boy , though , the Reds had him , pulled him back ; he screamed at Alvin to come back , do n't go , do n't go onto the waterAlvin heard him , and Alvin was as scared as he could be . But the Shining Man was waiting for him under the mouth of the tornado , standing on the water . Inside himselfAl felt such a longing , like Moses when he saw the burning bush  --  I have to stop and see this thing , said Moses , and that 's what Alvin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Because this was n't the kind of thing that happened in the natural universe , and that was the truth . There was n't no beseeching or hex or witchery he ever heard of that could call a tornado and turn a stormy lake into glass . Whatever this Red man was doing , it was the most important thing Al ever saw or ever was likely to see in his life.  |p163And  the Prophet loved him . That was one thing Al did n't have no doubt of . The Shining Man had stood once at the foot of his bed and taught him . Al remembered that the Shining Man cut himself then , too . Whatever the Prophet was doing , he used his own blood and pain to do it with . There was a real majesty to that . Under the circumstances , Al ca n't be much blamed for feeling kind of worshipful as he walked out onto the water . Behind him , the path loosened up , dissolved , disappeared . He felt the waves licking at his heels . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't no harm done to him . And finally he stood with the Prophet , who reached out and took Alvin 's hands in his . " Stand with me , " shouted the Prophet . " Stand here in the eye of the land , and see ! " Then the tornado sank quickly downward ; the water leaped up , rising like a wall around them . They were in the very center of the tornado , getting sucked upwardUntil the Prophet reached out one bloody hand and touched the waterspout , and it , too , went smooth and hard as glass . No , not glass . It was as clear and clean as a drop of dew on a spiderweb . There was n't no storm now . Just Al and the Shining Man , in the middle of a tower of crystal , bright and transparent . Only instead of being like a window that showed what was happening outside , Al could n't see the lake or the storm or the shore through the crystal wall . Instead he saw other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tree floating down like a battering ram , and a young man leapingout onto the tree , rolling it over , turning it from the wagon . And then the man tangling in the roots of the tree , getting smashed against a boulder , then rolling and tumblingdownstream , all the time struggling to live , to breathe just a while longer , keep breathing , keep breath-ingHesaw a woman bearing a baby , and a little girl who stood nearby reached out and touched her belly . She shouted something , and the midwife reached in her hand and took the baby 's head , pulled it out . The mother tore and bled . The little girl reached under and pulled some/thing off the baby 's face ; the baby cried . The man in the river heard that cry , somehow , knew that he had lived long enough , and so he died . Al did n't know what to make of it . Until he heard the Prophet whisper in his ear : " The first thing you see in here is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junior ; the man who died was his brother , Vigor . Who was the girl who took the birth caul off his face ? Al never saw her before in his life . " I will show you , " said the Prophet . " This stays only a little while , and I have things to see for myself , but I will show you . " He took Alvin by the hand and together they rose upward through the column of glass . It did n't feel like flying , not like the soaring of a bird ; it was as if there was n't no up or down . The Prophet pulled him upward , but Al could n't figure how the Prophet pulled himself . Did n't matter . There were so many things to see . Wherever he hung in the air , he could look in any direction and see something else through the wall of the tower . Until he realized that every moment of time , every human life must be visible through this tower wall . How could you find your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one particular story in the hundreds , thousands , millions of moments of past time ? The Prophet stopped , hoisted the boy up until he could see what the Prophet was seeing , their cheeks pressed together , their breath mingling , the Prophet 's heartbeat loud in Alvin 's ear . " Look , " said the Prophet . What Alvin saw was a city , shining in sunlight . Towersof ice , it looked like , or clear glass , because when the sun set behind the city its light did n't so much as dim , and the city cast no shadow on the meadowland around it . Insidethat city there were people , like bright shadows movinghere and there , going up and down the towers without stairs or wings . More important than what he saw , though , was what he felt , looking at that place . Not peace , no , there was nothing quiet about what he felt . It was excitement , his heart pumping fast as a horse in full gallop . The people there , they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nobody was hungry , and no/body was ignorant , and nobody had to do something just because somebody else made them do it . " Where is that city ! " whispered Alvin . " I do n't know , " said the Prophet . " Every time I come here , I see it in a different shape . Sometimes these tall thin towers , sometimes big crystal mounds , sometimes just people living on a sea of crystal fire . I think this city was built many times in the past . I think it will be built again . " " Are you going to build it ? Is that what Prophetstown is for ? " Tears came from the Prophet 's eyes  --  spilling from his one good eye , oozing out of the slack lid of the other . " Red man ca n't build this place alone , " he said . " We are part of the land , and this city is more than the land alone . The land is good and bad , life and death all together , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green music , but he did n't say nothing , cause the Prophet was saying things he wanted to hear , and Al was smart enough to know that sometimes it 's better to listen than to talk . " But this city , " said the Prophet , " the crystal city is light without dark , clean without dirty , healthy without sick , strong without weak , plenty without hungry , drink without thirst , life without death . " " The people in that place , they are n't all happy , " said Alvin . " They do n't live forever . " " Ah , " said the Prophet . " You do n't see the samethat I see . " " What I see is , they 're building it . " Al frowned . " At one end they 're building it , and at the other end , it 's fallingdown . " " Ah , " said the Prophet . " The city I see will never fall . " " Well what 's the difference ? How come we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , Roach Boy . I never showed this to anybody . Now go back down , wait for me below . I have things to see before time starts again . " Just thinking about going down made Alvin start to sink , until he was clear to the bottom , on the shiny clearp166floor . Floor ? It could have been the ceiling for all he knowed . There was light coming up from there just like it was shining through the other walls , and he saw pictures there , too . He saw a huge cloud of dust spin faster and faster , but instead of spitting out dust it sucked it all in , and suddenly it started glowing , and then it caught fire , and it was the sun , just as plain as could be . Alvin knew somewhat about the planets , cause Thrower talked about them , so he was n't surprised to see them glowing points of light that pretty soon got dim . And after a while instead of dust mixed with darkness , it was all either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth , so small , but then he came closer and he saw how big it was , spinning so fast , one face of the Earth lit up from sunlight , the other face dark . He stood in the sky , it seemed , looking down on the lit place , but he could see all that was going on . First bare rock , spouting volcanoes ; then out of the ocean , plants spreading out , growing tall , ferns and trees . He saw fish leaping in the sea , crawly life on the shore where the tide came in , and then bugs and other small critters , hoppingand nibbling on leaves and catching each other and eating each other up . Them animals kept getting bigger and bigger , so fast Alvin could n't follow the changes , just the Earth spinning and him watching , huge monstrous creatures like he never heard of , with long snakey necks some of them , and teeth and jaws to tear down trees with a single bite , it looked like . And then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tigers and horses , all the life of the earth , getting more and more like what Alvin thought animals ought to look like . But nowhere in all this did he see a man . He found apes and hairy things that hit each other with rocks , things that walked on their hind legs but looked about as dumb as frogs . And then he did see some folks , though he was n't sure at first cause they were Black and he had n't seen but one Black man in his life , a slave owned by a peddler from the Crown Colonies , who happened to come through Vigor Church maybe two years back . But they looked like human people , all right , Black or not , and they were pullingfruit down out of trees and berries off of bushes , feed/ing each other , a passel of pickaninnies following in their tracks . Two of the young ones got to fighting , and the big one killed the little one . The papa came back then , and kicked the one who did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the dead one and brought him back to the mama , both of them crying , and they laid that dead child down and covered him up with rocks . Then they gathered up their family and walked on , and after just a few steps they were eating again , and the tears stopped , and they went on , just went on . These are folks , that 's sure , thought Alvin . This is just the way human people are . The Earth kept turning , and by the time it come round again there was all kinds of folks , dark ones in the hot countries , light ones in the cold countries , with all shades in between . Except when America came under the light of the sun . In America folks was pretty much all the same kind , all Red , whether they lived north or south , hot or cold , wet or dry . And the land was at peace , compared to the other part of the world . It was strange for him to see , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all its different races and nations , why , it changed with every sweep of the Earth , whole countries moved from one place to another , everything always shuffling around , and wars every minute , everywhere . The smaller land , America , it had some wars , too , but it was all slower , gentler . The people lived in a different rhythm . The land had its own heartbeat , its own life . From time to time more people would come from the old world  --  fishermen , mostly . Off course , led astray by storms , running from enemies . They 'd come , and for a time they 'd live their old-world life in America , trying to build fast , and breed fast , and kill as much as they could . Like a sickness . But then they 'd either join in with the Reds and disappear , or get killed off . None of them ever kept up their old-world ways . Until now , thought Alvin . Now when we came , we were just too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you begin to think you wo n't never get real sick , and then you get a dose of smallpox and you know that you were never truly sick before at all.  |p168Alvin  felt a hand on his shoulder . " So there is where you looked , " said the Prophet . " What did you see ? " " I think I saw the whole creation of the world , " said Al . " Just like in the Bible . I think I saw  --  " " I know what you saw . We all see this , all who have ever come to this place . " " I thought you said I was the first you brought . " " This place  --  there are many doors inside . Some walk in through fire . Some walk in through water . Some through being buried in the earth . Some by falling through the air . They come to this place and see . They go back and tell what they remember , as much of it as they understood , and tell it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen and remember , as much as they can understand . This is the seeing place . " " I do n't want to leave , " said Alvin . " No , and neither does the other one . " " Who ? Is there somebody else here ? " The Prophet shook his head . " Not his body . But I feel him in me , looking out of my eye . " He tapped the cheekbone under his good eye . " Not this eye , the other . " " Ca n't you tell who it is ? " " White , " he said . " It does n't matter . Whoever it is did no harm . I think maybe  --  will do a good thing . Now we go . " " But I want to know all the stories in this place ! " The Prophet laughed . " You could live forever and not see all the stories . They change faster than a man can see . " " How will I ever come here again ? I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never bring you back , " said the Prophet . " Why ? Did I do something wrong ? " " Hush , Roach Boy . I will never bring you back , because I will never come here myself again . This is the last time . I have seen the end of all my dreams . " For the first time , Alvin realized how sad the Prophet looked . His face was haggard with grief . " I saw you in this place . I saw that I had to bring youp169here . I saw you in the hands of the Chok-Taw . I sent my brother to get you , bring you back . " " Is it cause you brought me here that you ca n't never come here again yourself ? " " No . The land has chosen . The end will be soon . " He smiled , but it was a ghastly smile . " Your preacher , Reverend Thrower , he said to me once  --  if your foot gets sick , cut it off . Right ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Prophet . " This part of the land , it is already sick . Cut it off , so the rest of the land can live . " " What do you mean ? " Alvin conjured up pictures in his mind , about pieces of the land breaking off and falling into the sea . " Red man will go west of the Mizzipy . White man will stay east . Red part of land will live . White part of land will be very dead , cut off . Full of smoke and metal , guns and death . Red men who stay in the east will turn White . And White men wo n't come west of the Mizzipy . " " There 's already White men west of the Mizzipy . Trappers and traders , mostly , but a few farmers with their families . " " I know , " said the Prophet . " But what I see here today  --  I know how to make the White man never come west again , and how to make the Red man never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that ? " " If I tell , " said the Prophet , " then it wo n't happen . Some things in this place , you ca n't tell , or it changes , and they go away . " " Is it the crystal city ? " asked Alvin . " No , " said the Prophet . " It is the river of blood . It is the forest of iron . " " Show me ! " demanded the boy . " Let me see what you saw ! " " No , " said the Prophet . " You would n't keep the se-cret . " " Why would n't I ? If I give my word I wo n't break it ! " " You could give your word all day , Roach Boy , butp170if you saw the vision you would cry out in fear and pain . And you would tell your brother . You would tell your family . " " Is something going to happen to them ? " " Not one of your family will die , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . " " Show me ! " " No , " said the Prophet . " I will break the tower now , and you will remember what we did and said here . But the only way you 'll ever come back and see these things is if you find the crystal city . " The Prophet knelt down at the place where the wall met the floor . He pushed his bloody fingers into the wall and lifted . The wall rose up , dissolved , turned to wind . They were surrounded now by the scene they left so many hours before , it seemed . The water , the storm , the twister rising back up into the clouds above them . Lightning flashed all around them , and the rain came down , so fast it made the shore disappear . The rain that landed on the crystal place where they stood turned to crystal , too , becamepart of the floor under them . The Prophet went to the edge nearest the shore , and stepped out onto the rough water . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly  --  it was n't as firm as the platform . The Prophet reached back , took Alvin 's hand , pulled him out onto the new path he was making on the surface of the lake . It was n't near as smooth as before , and the farther they walked the rougher it got , the more it moved , the slicker it got so it was hard to go up and over the waves . " We stayed too long ! " cried the Prophet . Alvin could feel the black water under the thin shell of crystal , roiling with hate . Nothingness out of an ancient nightmare , wanting to break through the crystal , get hold of Al , suck him down , drown him , tear him to pieces , to the tiniest pieces of all , and discard him into the darkness . " It was n't me ! " shouted Alvin . The Prophet turned around , picked him up , lifted him to his shoulders . The rain beat down on him , the wind tried to tear him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . He could feel that now thep171Prophet 's feet were sinking down into the water more and more with every step . Behind them there was n't a trace of a path , all of it gone , the waves rising higher and higher . The Prophet stumbled , fell ; Alvin fell too , forward , knowing he was going to drownAnd found himself sprawled on the wet sand of the beach , the water licking up around him , sucking sand out from under him , trying to pull him back out into the water . Then strong hands under his arms , pulling him away , up the beach , up toward the dunes . " He 's out there , the Prophet ! " Alvin shouted . Or thought he shouted  --  his voice was just a whisper , and he hardly made a sound . It would n't have mattered , the wind being so loud . He opened his eyes and they were whipped full of sand and rain . Then Measure 's lips were against his ear , yelling to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I thought you were dead for sure , when that twister sucked you up ! Are you all right ? " " I saw everything ! " Alvin cried . But he was so feeblenow that he could n't make a sound , and he gave it up , let his body go limp , and collapsed into exhausted sleep.  |p173MEASURE  SAW LITTLE of Alvin  --  too little . After the episodewith the tornado on the lake , Measure would have thought Alvin would be awake to his danger here , eager to get away . Instead he seemed to care for nothing but to be with the Prophet , listening to his stories and the perverse poetic wisdom he dispensed . Once when Alvin was actually with him long enough to set and talk , Measure asked him why he bothered . " Even when them Reds talk English I ca n't understand them . Talk about the land like it was a person , things about taking only the life that offers itself , the land dying east of the Mizzipy  --  it ai n't dying here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's got smallpox , black death , and ten thousand hangnails , there ai n't no doctor knows how to cure it . " " Tenskwa-Tawa does know how , " said Alvin . " Then let him do it , and let 's get on home . " " Another day , Measure . " " Ma and Pall be worried sick , they think we 're dead ! " " Tenskwa-Tawa says the land is working out its own course . " " There you go again ! Land is land , and it ai n't got a thing to do with Pa getting a bunch of the boys together combing through the woods to find us ! " " Go on without me , then . "  |p174But  Measure was n't ready to do that yet . He did n't have no particular wish to face Ma if he came home withoutAlvin . " Oh , he was fine when I left him . Just playing around with tornadoes and walking on water with a oneeyedRed . Did n't want to come home just yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Measure was n't ripe to come home just now , not if he did n't have Alvin in tow . And it was sure he could n't take Alvin against his will . The boy would n't even listen to talk of escape . The worst of it was that while everybody liked Alvin just fine , jabbering to him in English and Shaw-Nee , not a soul there would so much as talk to Measure , except TaKumsawhimself , and the Prophet , who talked all the time whether anybody was listening or not . It got powerful lonely , walking around all day . And not walking far , either . Nobody talked to him , but if he started heading away from the dunes toward the woods , somebody 'd shoot off an arrow . It 'd land with a thud in the sand right by him . They sure trusted their aim a lot better than Measure did . He kept thinking about arrows drifting a little this way or that and hitting him . Escape was a silly idea , when Measure gave it serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what he could n't figure was why they did n't want him to go . They were n't doing nothing with him . He was completely useless . And they swore they had no plans to kill him or even break him up a little . Fourth day at the dunes , though , it finally came to a head . He went to Ta-Kumsaw and plain demanded that he be let go . Ta-Kumsaw looked annoyed , but that was pretty normal for him . This time , though , Measure did n't back down . " Do n't you know it 's plain stupid for you to keep us here ? It ai n't like we disappeared without a trace , you know . Our horses must have been found by now with your name all over them . " That was the first time Measure realized that Ta-Kumsawdid n't have a notion about them horses . " My name is n't on horses . " " On their saddles , Chief . Do n't you know ? Them Chok-Taw who took us  --  if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied about either , if you want to know  --  they carved your name into the saddle on my horse and then jabbed the horse so it 'd run . The Prophet 's name was carved in Alvin 's saddle . They must 've gone home right away . " Ta-Kumsaw 's face seemed to turn dark , his eyes flashing like lightning . If you want to see a sky-god , thought Measure , this is what he looks like . " All the Whites , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " They 'll think I stole you . " " You did n't know ? " asked Measure . " Well if that do n't beat all . I thought you Reds knew everything , the way you carry on . I even tried to mention it to some of your boys , but they just turn their backs on me . And all the time none of you knowed it . " " I did n't know , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " But someone did . " He stalked off , as best you can do that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , I want you ! " So Measure followed him to the bark-covered wigwamwhere the Prophet held Bible classes or whatever it was he did all day . Ta-Kumsaw was n't shy about showing how angry he was . Did n't say a thing  --  just walked around the wigwam , kicking away the rocks that helped anchor it to the sand . Then he picked up one end of it and started lifting . " Needs two men for this , " he said . Measure squatted down next to him , got a grip , and counted to three . Then he heaved . Ta-Kumsaw did n't , so the wigwam only lifted about six inches and dropped back down . Measure grunted from the exertion and glared at TaKumsaw . " Why did n't you lift ? " " You only got to three , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " That 's the count , Chief . One , two , three . " " You Whites are such fools . Every man knows fouris the strong number . " Ta-Kumsaw counted to four . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped it clean over . By now , of course , whoever was inside knew what was going on , but nobody shouted or nothing . And when the wigwam lay on its back like a stranded turtle , there sat the Prophet and Alvin and afew Reds , cross-legged on blankets on the sand , the one/eyed Red still talking away like as if nothing had happened at all . Ta-Kumsaw started bellowing in Shaw-Nee , and the Prophet answered him , mildly at first , but louder and louder as time went on . It was quite a row , the sort of yelling that in Measure 's experience always came to blows . But not with these two Reds . Just yelled for a half hour and then stood there , facing each other , breathing hard , saying nothing at all . The silence was only a few minutes , but it felt longer than the shouting . " You understand any of this ? " asked Measure . " I just know that the Prophet said Ta-Kumsaw was coming today , and he 'd be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did n't he do something to change it ? " " Oh , he 's real careful about that . He 's got everything going just the way it needs to , for the land to be divided right between White and Red . If he goes and changes something because he knows what 's going to happen , he might undo everything , mess it all up . So he knows what 's going to happen , but he do n't tell a soul who might change it . " " Well , what good does it do to know the future if you ai n't going to do nothing about it ? " " Oh , he does things , " said Alvin . " He just does n't necessarily tell folks what he 's doing . That 's why he made the crystal tower when that storm came by . To make sure the vision was still the way it was supposed to be , to make sure things had n't gotten themselves off the right path . " " What 's all this about ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Measure . You 're the one helped him turn over the wigwam . " " Beats me . I just told him about his and the Prophet 's names being carved on our saddles . " " He knowed that , " said Alvin . " Well , he sure acted like he did n't hear of it before . " " I told the Prophet myself , the night after he took me into the tower . " " Did n't it come to your mind that maybe the Prophet did n't tell Ta-Kumsaw ? "  | " Why not ? " asked Alvin . " Why would n't he tell it ? " Measure nodded wisely . " I have a feeling that 's the very question Ta-Kumsaw 's asking his brother about right now . " " It 's crazy not to tell , " said Alvin . " I figured TaKumsawmust 've sent somebody by now to tell our folks we were all right . " " You know what I think , Al ? I think your Prophet 's been playing us all for fools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think he 's working out some plan , and part of that plan is keeping us from going home . And since that means all our family and neighbors and all are going to be up in arms about it , you can figure it out . The Prophet wants to get a real hot little shooting war going here . " " No ! " said Alvin . " The Prophet says no man can kill another man who does n't want to die , that it 's as wrong to kill a White man as it is to kill a wolf or a bear that you do n't want for food . " " Maybe he wants us for food . But he 's going to have a war if we do n't get home and tell our kin that we 're safe . " That was right when Ta-Kumsaw and the Prophet fell silent . And it was Measure who broke the silence . " Think you boys are about set to let us go home ? " he asked . The Prophet immediately sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the two Whites . " Go home , Measure , " said the Prophet . " Not without Alvin . " " Yes without Alvin , " said the Prophet . " If he stays in this part of the country , he will die . " " What are you talking about ? " " What I saw with my eyes ! " said the Prophet . " The things to come . If Alvin goes home now , he 'll be dead in three days . But you go , Measure . Today in the afternoon is a very perfect time for you to go . " " What are you going to do with Alvin ? You think he 's going to be any safer with you ? " " Not with me , " said the Prophet . " With my brother . "  | " This is all a stupid idea ! " shouted Ta-Kumsaw . " My brother is going to make many visits . With the French at Detroit , with the Irrakwa , the Appalachee nation , with the Chok-Taw and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of White who might stop a very bad war from happening . " " If I talk to Reds , Tenskwa-Tawa , I 'll talk to them about coming to fight with me and drive the White men back across the mountains , back into their ships , back into the sea ! " " Talk about whatever you want , " said TenskwaTawa . " But leave this afternoon , and take the White boy who walks like a Red man . " " No , " said Ta-Kumsaw . Grief swept across Tenskwa-Tawa 's face , and he moaned sharply . " Then all the land will die , not just a part . If you do n't do what I say today , then White man will kill all the land , from one ocean to the other , from north to south , all the land dead ! And Red men will die except a very few who will live on tiny pieces of ugly desert land , like prisons , live there all their lives , because you did not obey what I saw in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions ! TaKumsawis the face of the land , the voice of the land ! The redbird told me , and you know that , Lolla-Wossiky ! " The Prophet whispered . " Lolla-Wossiky is dead . " " The voice of the land does n't obey a one-eyed whisky-Red . " The Prophet was stung to the heart , but he kept his face impassive . " You are the voice of the land 's anger . You will stand in battle against a mighty army of Whites . I tell you this will happen before the first snow falls . If the White boy Alvin is not with you , then you will die in defeat . " " And if he is with me ? " " Then you will live , " said the Prophet . " I 'm glad to go , " said Alvin . When Measure started to argue , Alvin touched his arm . " You can tell Ma and Pa I 'm all right . But I want to go . The Prophet told me , I can learn more from Ta-Kumsaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Then I 'm going with you , too , " said Measure . " I gave my word to Pa and Ma both . " The Prophet looked coldly at Measure . " You will go back to your own people . " " Then Alvin comes with me . " " You are not the one who says , " the Prophet retorted . " And you are ? Why , because your boys got all the arrows ? " Ta-Kumsaw reached out , touched Measure on the shoulder . " You are not a fool , Measure . Someone has to go back and tell your people that you and Alvin are n't dead . " " If I leave him behind , how do I know he ai n't dead , tell me that ? " " You know , " said Ta-Kumsaw , " because I say that while I live no Red man will hurt this boy . " " And while he 's with you , nobody can hurt you , either , is that it ? My little brother 's a hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta-Kumsaw and TenskwaTawawere both about as mad as they could be without killing him , and he knew he was so mad he was ready to break his hand on somebody 's face . And it might 've come to that , too , except Alvin stood up , all ten years and sixty inches of him , and took charge . " Measure , you know better than anybody that I can take care of myself . You just tell Pa and Ma about what I did with them Chok-Taw , and they 'll see that I 'm fit . They were sending me off anyway , were n't they ? To be a prenticeto blacksmith . Well , I 'm going to serve as prentice for a little while to Ta-Kumsaw , that 's all . And everybody knows that except for maybe Tom Jefferson , Ta-Kumsaw is the greatest man in America . If I can somehow keep TaKumsawalive , then that 's my duty . And if you can stop a war from happening by going home , then that 's your duty . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he even agreed . But he also knew that he was going to have to face his parents . " There 's a story in the Bible , about Joseph , the son of Jacob . He was his father 's favorite son , but his brothers hated him and sold him into slavery , and thenp180they took some of his clothes and soaked them in goat 's blood and tore them up and came and told their father , Look , he got hisself et by lions . And his father tore his clothes and he just would n't stop grieving , not ever . " " But you 're going to tell them I ai n't dead . " " I 'm going to tell them I saw you turn a hatchet head soft as butter , walk on the water , fly up into a tornado  --  that 'll just make them feel all safe and warm , knowing you 're tucked into such a common ordinary life with these here Reds . " Ta-Kumsaw interrupted . " You are a coward , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and mother . " " I made an oath to them , " said Measure . " You 're a coward . You take no risk . No danger . You want Alvin with you to keep you safe ! " That was just too much for Measure . He swung out with his right arm , aiming to connect with Ta-Kumsaw 's smile . It did n't surprise him that Ta-Kumsaw blocked the blow  --  but it was kind of a shock that he caught Measure 's wrist so easy , twisted it . Measure got even madder , punched at Ta-Kumsaw 's stomach , and this time he did connect . But the chief 's belly was about as soft as a stump , and he snagged Measure 's other hand and held them both . So Measure did what any good wrassler knows to do . He popped his knee up right between Ta-Kumsaw 's legs . Now , Measure had done that only twice before , and both times he did it , the other fellow got right down on the ground , writhing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he was soaking up the pain , getting madder and madder . Since he was still holding on to Measure 's arms , Measure had a good notion that he was about to die , ripped right in half down the middle  --  that 's how mad Ta-Kumsaw looked . Ta-Kumsaw let go of Measure 's arms . Measure took his arms back , rubbed his wrists where the chief 's fingermarks were white and sore . The chief looked angry , all right , but it was Alvin he was mad at . He turned and looked down at that boy like he was ready to peel off Alvin 's skin and feed it to him raw.  | " You did your filthy White man 's tricks in me , " he said . " I did n't want neither of you getting hurt , " said Alvin . " You think I 'm a coward like your brother ? You think I 'm afraid of pain ? " " Measure ai n't no coward ! " " He threw me to the ground with White man 's tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know I did n't ask him to do that ! I 'll take you now , if you want ! I 'll fight you fair and square ! " " Strike a man with your knee ? " said Ta-Kumsaw . " You do n't know how to fight like a man . " " I 'll face you any way you want , " said Measure . Ta-Kumsaw smiled . " Gatlopp , then . " By now a whole bunch of Reds had gathered round , and when they heard the word gatlopp , they started hootingand laughing . There was n't a White in America who had n't heard stories about how Dan Boone ran the gatlopp and just kept on running , that first time he escaped from the Reds ; but there was other stories , about Whites who got beat to death . Taleswapper told about it somewhat , the time he visited last year . It 's like a jury trial , he said , where the Reds hit you hard or easy depending on how much they think you deserve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll strike you hard to test you with pain . But if they think you 're a coward , they 'll break your bones so you never get out of the gatlopp alive . The chief ca n't tell the gatlopp how hard to strike , or where . It 's just about the most democratic and vicious system of justice ever seen . " I see you 're afraid of that , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Of course I am , " said Measure . " I 'd be a fool not to , specially with your boys already thinking I 'm a cow-ard . " " I 'll run the gatlopp before you , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " I 'll tell them to strike me as hard as they strike you . " " They wo n't do it , " said Measure . " They will if I ask them , " said Ta-Kumsaw . He mustp182have seen the disbelief on Measure 's face , cause then he said , " And if they do n't , I 'll run the gatlopp again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ? " Ta-Kumsaw looked up and down Measure 's body . Lean and strong , Measure knew he was , from chopping trees and firewood , toting pails , lifting hay , and hoisting grain bags in the mill . But he was n't tough . His skin was burnt something awful from being near naked in the sun out here on the dunes , even though he tried to use a blanket to cover up . Strong but soft , that 's what Ta-Kumsawfound when he studied Measure 's body . " The blow that would kill you , " said Ta-Kumsaw , " it might bruise me . " " So you admit it ai n't fair . " " Fair is when two men face the same pain . Courage is when two men face the same pain . You do n't want fair , you want easy . You want safe . You 're a coward . I knew you would n't do it . " " I 'll do it , " said Measure . " And you ! " cried Ta-Kumsaw , pointing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you cure nothing , you do n't take away pain ! " Alvin did n't say a word , just looked at him . Measure knew that look . It was the expression Alvin got on his face whenever he had no intention of doing a thing you said . " Al , " said Measure . " You better promise me not to meddle . " Al just set his lips and did n't speak . " You better promise me not to meddle , Alvin Junior , or I just wo n't go home . " Alvin promised . Ta-Kumsaw nodded and walked away , talking in Shaw-Nee to his boys . Measure felt sick with fear . " Why are you afraid , White man ? " asked the Prophet . " Cause I 'm not stupid , " said Measure . " Only a stupidman would n't be scared to run the gatlopp . " The Prophet just laughed and walked off . Alvin was sitting in the sand again , writing or drawingor something with his finger . " You ai n't mad at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you ca n't be half as mad at me as I am at you . You got no duty to these Reds , but you sure got a duty to your ma and pa . Things being how they are , I ca n't make you do nothing , but I can tell you I 'm ashamed of you for siding with them against me and your kin . " Al looked up , and there was tears in his eyes . " Maybe I am siding with my kin , did you think of that ? " " Well you sure got a funny way of doing it , seeing as how you 'll keep Ma and Pa worried sick for months , no doubt . " " Do n't you think about anything bigger than our family ? Do n't you think maybe the Prophet 's working out a plan to save the lives of thousands of Reds and Whites ? " " That 's where we 're different , " said Measure . " I do n't believe there is anything bigger than our family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't even occur to Measure what Alvin wrote in the sand . He saw , but he did n't look , he did n't read it . Now , though , the words came to his mind . RUN AWAY NOW , that 's what Al was writing . A message to him ? Why did n't he say it with his mouth , then ? Nothing made sense . The writing probably was n't for him . And he sure was n't going to run away and have Ta-Kumsaw and all them Reds sure he was a coward forever . What difference would it make if he ran away now ? The Reds 'd catch him in a minute , there in the woods , and then he 'd run the gatlopp anyway , only it 'd even be worse for him . The warriors formed two lines in the sand . They were carrying heavy branches fallen or cut from trees . Measure watched as an old man took the beads from around TaKumsaw'sneck , then pulled off his loincloth . Ta-Kumsaw turned to Measure and grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . Red man is never naked in his own land . The wind is my clothing , the fire of the sun , the dust of the earth , the water of rain . I wear all these . I am the voice and the face of the land ! " " Just get on with it , " said Measure . " I know someone who says a man like you has no poetry in his soul , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " And I know plenty of people who say that a man like you has no soul at all . "  |p184Ta-Kumsaw  glared at him , barked a few words to his men , and then stepped between the lines . He walked slowly , his chin high and arrogant . The first Red struck him a blow across his thighs , using the skinny end of a branch . Ta-Kumsaw snatched the branch out of his hands , turned it around , and made him strike again , this time in the chest , a harsh blow that drove the air out of Ta-Kumsaw 's lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood . The lines ran up the face of a dune , so that progress up the hill was slow . Ta-Kumsaw never paused as the blows came . His men were stern-faced , dutiful . They were helping him show courage , and so they gave him pain  --  but no damaging blows . His thighs and belly and shoulderstook the worst of it . Nothing on his shins , nothing in his face . But that did n't mean he had it easy . Measure could see his shoulders , bloody from the rough bark of the branches . He imagined himself receiving every blow that fell , and knew that they 'd strike him harder . I 'm a royal fool , he said to himself . Here I am matching courage with the noblest man in America , as everybody knows . Ta-Kumsaw reached the end , turned , faced Measure from the top of the dune . His body was dripping with blood , and he was smiling . " Come to me , brave White man , " he called . Measure did n't hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from behind that stopped him . The Prophet , shouting in Shaw-Nee . The Reds looked at him . When he was finished , Ta-Kumsaw spat . Measure , not knowing what had been said , started forward again . When he got to the first Red , he expected at least as hard a blow as Ta-Kumsaw got . But there was nothing . He took anotherstep . Nothing . Maybe to show their contempt they meant to hit him in the back , but he climbed higher and higher up the dune , and still there was not a blow , not a move . He should have been relieved , he knew , but instead he was angry . They gave Ta-Kumsaw help in showing his courage , and now they were making Measure 's passage through the gatlopp a walk of shame instead of honor . Hep185whirled around and faced the Prophet , who stood at the bottom of the dune , his arm across Alvin 's shoulders . " What did you say to them ? " Measure demanded . " I told them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prophet kidnapped these boys and murdered them . I told them that if they marked you in any way , when you went home everybody would say we torturedyou . " " And I say I want a fair chance to prove I 'm not a coward ! " " The gatlopp is a stupid idea , for men who forget their duty . " Measure reached down and grabbed a club from a Red man 's hand . He struck his own thighs with it , again , again , trying to draw blood . It hurt , but not very bad , becausewhether he wanted to or not , his arms flinched at causing pain to his own self . So he thrust the branch back into the warrior 's arms and demanded , " Hit me ! " " The bigger a man is , the more people he serves , " said the Prophet . " A small man serves himself . Bigger is to serve your family . Bigger is to serve your tribe . Then your people . Biggest of all , to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you show courage . For your family , your tribe , your people , my people  --  for the land and all people in it , you walk this gatlopp with no mark on you . " Slowly , Measure turned around , walked up the dune to Ta-Kumsaw , untouched . Again Ta-Kumsaw spat on the ground , this time at Measure 's feet . " I ai n't no coward , " said Measure . Ta-Kumsaw walked away . Walked , slipped , slid down the dune . The warriors of the gatlopp also walked away . Measure stood at the top of the hill , feeling ashamed , angry , used . " Go ! " shouted the Prophet . " Walk south from here ! " He handed a pouch to Alvin , who scrambled up the dune and gave it to Measure . Measure opened it . It containedpemmican and dried corn , so he could suck on it on his way . " You coming with me ? " Measure asked  | " I 'm going with Ta-Kumsaw , " said Alvin . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Measure . " I know , " said Alvin . " If he was n't going to let me go through it , " said Measure , " how come the Prophet allowed it to happen at all ? " " He ai n't telling , " said Alvin . " But something terrible'sgoing to happen .. And he wants it to happen . If you'd 've went before , when I told you to run away  --  " " They would 've caught me , Al . " " It was worth a try . Now when you leave , you 're doing just what he wants . " " He plans for me to get killed or something ? " " He promised me you 'd live through this , Measure . And all the family . Him and Ta-Kumsaw , too . " " Then what 's so terrible ? " " I do n't know . I 'm just scared of what 's going to happen . I think he 's sending me with Ta-Kumsaw to save my life . " One more time , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , come with me now . " Alvin started to cry . " Measure , I love you , but I ca n't go . " Still crying , he ran down the dune . Not wanting to watch him out of sight , Measure started walking . Almost due south , a little bit east . He would n't have no trouble finding the way . But he felt sick with dread , and with shame for having let them talk him into leaving without his brother . I failed at everything here . I 'm pretty near useless . He walked the rest of that day and spent the night in a pile of leaves in a hollow . Next day he walked till late afternoon , when he came to a south-flowing creek . It would flow into the Tippy-Canoe or the Wobbish , one or the other . It was too deep to walk down the middle , and too overgrown to walk alongside . So he just kept the stream within earshot and made his own way through the forest . He was n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by bushes and branches and bit by insects , none of which felt too good on his sunburnt skin . He also kept running into thickets and having to back out . Like thep187land was his enemy , slowing him down . He kept wishing for a horse and a good road . Hard as it was to go through the woods , though , he was up to it . Partly cause Alvin toughened up his feet for him . Partly cause of the way he seemed to breathe deeper than ever before . But it was more than that . Strength was wound in among his muscles in a way he never felt in his life . Never so alive as now . And he thought , If I had a horse right now , I think maybe I 'd be wishing I was on foot . It was late afternoon on the second day when he heard a splashing sound in the river . There was no mistaking it  --  horses were being walked in the stream . That meant White men , maybe even folks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He scrambled his way to the stream , getting scratched something awful on the way . They were headed downstream , away from him , four men on horseback . It was n't till he was already out into the stream , yelling to bust his head off that he noticed they were wearing the green uniformof the U.S. Army . He never heard of them coming up in these parts . This was the country where White folks did n't go much , on account of not wanting to rile up the French at Fort Chicago . They heard him right off , and wheeled their horses around to see him . Almost quick as they saw him , three of them had their muskets up to the ready . " Do n't shoot ! " Measure cried . The soldiers rode toward him , making pretty slow progress as their horses had some trouble breasting the water . " Do n't shoot , for heaven 's sake , " Measure said . " You can see I ai n't armed , I do n't even have a knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " said one soldierto another . " Of course I do ! I 'm a White man . " " Now do n't that beat all , " said another soldier . " First time I ever heard one of them claim to be White . " Measure looked down at his own skin . It was a vividred color from his sunburn , much lighter than any true Redman . Ile was wearing a loincloth , and he looked prettyp188wild and dirty . But his beard was growing somewhat , was n't it ? For the first time Measure found himself wishinghe was a hairy man , with thick heavy beard and lots of chest hair . Then there 'd be no mistake , since Reds did n't grow much . As it was , though , they would n't see his light-colored mustache hair or the few little hairs on his chin till they were up close . And they were n't taking no chances , either . Only one rode right up to him . The others hung back , their muskets out , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambush on the riverbank . He could see that the man riding toward him was plumb scared to death , looking this way and that , waiting to see a Red man flitch an arrow at him . Kind of an idiot , Measure decided , since there was n't no chance of seeing a Red man in the woods till his arrow was already in you . The soldier did n't come right to him . He circled around , got beside him . Then he looped a rope and tossed it to Measure . " You hitch this around your chest , under your arms , " said the soldier . " What for ? " " So I can lead you along . " " The hell I will , " said Measure . " If I thought you were going to drag me along by a rope in the middle of a creek , I 'd 've stayed on dry land and walked home my-self . " " If you do n't put this rope around you in five seconds , them boys are going to blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? " Measure demanded . " I 'm Measure Miller . I was captured with my little brother , Alvin , almost a week ago , and I 'm just going home to Vigor Church . " " Well , ai n't that a real pretty story ? " said the soldier . He drew back the rope , sopping wet , and cast it again . This time it hit Measure in the face . Measure caught at it , held it in his hand . The soldier drew his sword . " Get ready to shoot , boys ! " shouted the soldier . " It 's that renegade , all right ! " " Renegade ! I  --  " Then it finally occurred to Measure that something had gone real bad with this . They knew who he was , and they still wanted to take him prisoner.  |p189With  three muskets and a sword close by , they had a fair chance of maybe even killing him if he tried to run away . This was the U.S. Army , was n't it ? Once they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would get cleared up . So he put the rope over his head , and pulled the loop around his chest . It was n't too bad as long as they were in the water ; sometimes he just floated along . But pretty soon they got out and then they made him walk along behind as they picked their way through the woods . They were looping east , around behind Vigor Church . Measure tried talking , but they told him to shut up . " I tell you , we been told we can bring in renegades like you alive or dead . White man dressed like a Red  --  we know what you are . " From their conversation he was able to gather a few things . They were on a scout-around from General Harrison . It made Measure sick , to think things had got to the point where they 'd call on that likker-dealing scoundrel to come north . And he got here awful fast , too . They spent the night camped in a clearing . They made so much noise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Red in the whole country nosing around before morning . The next day , he flat refused to be dragged along on a rope . " I 'm near naked , I got no weapons , and you can kill me or let me ride . " They could talk about bringing him in alive or dead and not caring which , but he knew that that was talk . These were a crude bunch , but they did n't hankermuch after killing white men in cold blood . So he ended up on horseback , holding one of them around the waist . Pretty soon they reached country that had some roads and trails , and they made good time . Just after noon they reached an army camp . Not much of an army , maybe a hundred in uniform and another two hundred marching and drilling on a parade ground that used to be a pasture . Measure could n't remember the name of the family that lived here . They were new folks , just come up from the area around Carthage . Turned out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was General liar/rison had their house for his headquarters , and these scouts led him straight to Harrison . " Ah , " said Harrison . " One of the renegades . " " I 'm no renegade , " said Measure . " They been treatingme like a prisoner this whole way . I swear the Reds treated me better than your White soldiers . " " I ai n't surprised much , " said Harrison . " They treated you real nice , I 'm sure . Where 's the other rene-gade ? " " Other renegade ? You mean my brother Alvin ? You know who I am , and you ai n't letting me go home ? " " You answer my questions , and then I 'll give some thought to answering yours . " " My brother Alvin ai n't here , and he ai n't coming , and from what I see before me I 'm real glad he did n't come . " " Alvin ? Ah , yes , they told me you were claiming to be Measure Miller . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prophet . " Measure spat on the floor . " You know that ? From a few tore-up bloody clothes ? Well you do n't fool me . Do you think I do n't see what you 're doing ? " " Take him to the cellar , " said Harrison . " Be real gentle with him . " " You do n't want folks to know I 'm alive , cause then they 'll see they do n't need you up here ! " shouted Measure . " I would n't be surprised if you got them Chok-Taw to capture us in the first place ! " " If that 's true , " said Harrison , " then if I were you I 'd watch how I talked and what I said . I 'd be real worried about getting home alive , ever . Now look at yourself , boy . Skin red as a redbird , wearing a loincloth , looking wild as a real bad dream . No , I reckon if it turned out you was shot dead by mistake , nobody 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 'd know , " said Measure . " You ca n't fool him with a lie like that , Harrison . And Armor-of-God , he 'll  --  " " Annor-of-God ? That pathetic weakling ? The one who keeps telling people that Ta-Kumsaw and the Prophet are innocent , and we should n't be getting ready to wipe them out ? Nobody listens to him no more , Measure . "  | " They will . Alvin 's alive , and you 'll never catch him . " " Why not ? " " Cause he 's with Ta-Kumsaw . " " Ah , and where is that ? " " Not around here , you can bet . " " You 've seen him ? And the Prophet ? " The hungry look in Harrison 's eyes made Measure kind of step back and hold his tongue . " I seen what I seen , " said Measure . " And I 'll say what I say . " " Say what I ask , or you 'll be dead , " said Harrison . " Kill me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you this . I saw the Prophet call a tornado out of a storm . I saw him walk on water . I saw him prophesy , and his prophecies all come true . He knows everything you plan to do . You think you 're doing what you want , but you 'll end up serving his purpose , you watch and see . " " What an idea , " said Harrison , chuckling . " By that reckoning , boy , it serves his purpose for you to be in my hands , do n't it ? " He waved his hands , and the soldiersI dragged him out of the house and down into the root cellar . They treated him real gentle on the way  --  kicked him and knocked him down and all they could before they threw him down the steps and barred the door behind him . Since these folks came from Carthage country , the cellar door had a lock , as well as the bar . Down with the carrots , potatoes , and spiders , Measure tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one big ache . All the scratches and the sunburn were nothing compared to the raw skin inside his thighs from riding behind with bare legs . And that was nothing compared to the pain from the kicks and bashes they gave him on the way here . Measure did n't waste no more time . He knew what was going on well enough to know Harrison could n't let him out alive . He had those scouts out looking for him and Alvin . If they turned up alive , it would undo all his plans , and that 'd be a real shame , cause things were going just right for Harrison . After all these years , here he was at Vigor Church , training the local men to be soldiers , whilenobody was listening to Armor-of-God at all . Measurep192did n't much like the Prophet , but compared to Harrison the Prophet was a saint . Or was he ? The Prophet had him wait for the gatlopp  --  why ? So he 'd leave in the afternoon two days ago , instead of morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were riding down . Otherwise he would 've come to Prophetstown and then hopped on over into Vigor Church without seeing a soldier . They 'd never have found him , if he had n't heard them and called out to them him. ; elf . Was this all part of the Prophet 's plan ? Well , so what if it was ? Maybe the Prophet 's plan was a good thing , and maybe it was n't  --  so far Measure did n't think too highly of it . But he sure was n't going to sit around in a root cellar waiting to see how the plan worked out . He burrowed his way through the potatoes to the back of the cellar . There was more spiderwebs in his face and hair than he cared for , but this was n't a time to worry about tidiness . Pretty soon he cleared him a space at the back , with the potatoes pushed mostly to the front . When they opened the doors , they 'd just see a lot of potatoes . Not a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dug out , timberedover , roofed , and then the roof covered up with all the dirt from the hole . He could dig into the back wall and come up behind the cellar , and they could n't see a thing from the house at all . It was bare-hands digging , but this was rich Wobbish soil . He 'd come out looking more like a Black than a Red , but he did n't much care . Trouble was , the back wall was n't dirt , it was wood . They 'd walled it in , right to the bottom . Tidy folks . Thefloor was dirt , all right . But that meant digging down underthe wall before he could tunnel up . Instead of beingsomething he could do overnight , it 'd take days . And anytime , they might catch him digging . Or just plain drag himout and shoot him . Or maybe even bring back them ChokTaws , to do what they started  --  leave him looking like TaKumsawand the Prophet had him tortured . All possible . Home was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So close to home , and they did n't even guessit , had no idea they ought to come to help . He remem/bered that torch girl from Hatrack River , years ago , the one who saw them stuck in the river and sent help . That 's who I need right now , I need me a torch , somebody who 'd find me and send help . But that was n't too likely . Not for Measure . If it was Alvin , now , there 'd be eight miracles , whatever it took to get him out safe . But for Measure , there 'd be just whateverhe could work up for hisself . He broke a fingernail half off in the first ten minutes of digging . The pain was real bad , and he knew he was bleeding . If they dragged him out now , they 'd know he was making a tunnel . But it was his only chance . So he kept digging , pain and all , every now and then stopping to toss out a potato that rolled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loincloth and used it in his work . He 'd loosen up the soil with his hands , then pile it onto the cloth and use that to hoist it up out of the hole . It was n't as good as having a spade , but it sure beat moving the dirt out one handful at a time . What did he have , days ? Hours ?  |p195IT  WAS N'T AN HOUR after Measure left . Ta-Kumsaw stood atop a dune , the White boy Alvin beside him . And in front of him , Tenskwa-Tawa . Lolla-Wossiky . His brother , the boy who once cried for the death of bees . A prophet , supposedly . Speaking the will of the land , supposedly . Speakingwords of cowardice , surrender , defeat , destruction . " This is the oath of the land at peace , " said the Prophet . " To take none of the White man 's weapons , none of the White man 's tools , none of the White man 's clothing , none of the White man 's food , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White man 's promises . Above all , never to take a life that does n't offer itself to die . " The Reds who heard him had heard it all before , as had Ta-Kumsaw . Most of those who had come to Mizogan with them had already refused the Prophet 's covenant of weakness . They took a different oath , the oath of the land 's anger , the oath that Ta-Kumsaw offered them . Every White must live under Red man 's law , or leave the land , or die . A White man 's weapons can be used , but only to defend Reds against murder and theft . No Red man will torture or kill a prisoner  --  man , woman , or child . Above all , the death of no Red will go unavenged . Ta-Kumsaw knew that if all the Reds of America took his oath , they could still defeat the White man . Whites had only made such inroads because the Reds could neverp196unite under one leader . The Whites could always ally themselves with a tribe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help them find their enemy . If Reds had not turned renegade  --  like the unspeakableIrrakwa , the half-White Cherriky  --  then the White man could not have survived here in the land . They would have been swallowed up , lost , as had happened to every other group that came from the old world . When the Prophet finished his challenge , there were only a handful who took his oath , who would go back with him . He seemed sad , Ta-Kumsaw thought . Weighed down . He turned his back on the ones who remained  --  on the warriors , who would fight the White man . " Those men are yours , " said the Prophet . " I wish there were n't so many . " " Mine , yes , but I wish there were n't so few . " " Oh , you 'll find allies enough . Chok-Taw , Cree-Ek , Chicky-Saw , the vicious Semmy-Noll of the Oky-Fenoky . Enough to raise the greatest army of Reds ever seen in this land , all thirsting for White man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " You 'll lose your cause by killing , " said the Prophet . " I 'll win my cause . " " By dying . " " If the land calls for my death , I 'll answer . " " And all your people with you . " The Prophet shook his head . " I 've seen what I 've seen . The people of my oath are as much a part of the land as the bear or the buffalo , the squirrel or the beaver , the turkey or the pheasant or the grouse . All those animals have stood still to take your arrow , have n't they ? Or stretched out their neck for your knife . Or lain down their head for your tommy-hawk . " " They 're animals , meant to be meat . " " They 're alive , meant to live until they die , and when they die , die so that others can live . " " Not me . Not my people . We wo n't stretch out our neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Ta-Kumsaw by the shoulders , tears streaming down his face . He pressed his cheek against TaKumsaw'scheek , putting his tears on his brother 's face.  | " Come find me across the Mizzipy , when all this is done , " said the Prophet . " I 'll never let the land be divided , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " The east does n't belong to the White man . " " The east will die , " said the Prophet . " Follow me west , where the White man will never go . " Ta-Kumsaw said nothing . The White boy Alvin touched the Prophet 's hand . " Tenskwa-Tawa , does that mean I can never go west ? " The Prophet laughed . " Why do you think I 'm sending you with Ta-Kumsaw ? If anyone can turn a White boy Red , Ta-Kumsaw can . " " I do n't want him , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Take him or die , " said the Prophet . Then the Prophet walked down the slope of the dune , to the dozen men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal the covenant . They walked off along the shore of the lake , to where their families waited . Tomorrowthey 'd be back in Prophetstown . Ripe to be slaughtered . Ta-Kumsaw waited until the Prophet had disappeared behind a dune . Then he cried out to the hundreds who remained . " When will the White man have peace ? " " When he leaves ! " they shouted . " When he dies ! " Ta-Kumsaw laughed and held out his arms . He felt their love and trust like the heat of the sun on a winter 's day . Lesser men had felt that heat before , but it had oppressedthem , because they were n't worthy of the trust they had been given . Not Ta-Kumsaw . He had measured himself , and he knew that there was no task ahead of him that he could n't accomplish . Only treachery could keep him from victory . And Ta-Kumsaw was very good at knowing a man 's heart . Knowing if he could be trusted . Knowing if he was a liar . Had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could n't hide from him . They left only minutes later . A few dozen men led the women and children to the new place where their wanderingvillage would settle . They stayed no more than three days in any place  --  a permanent village like Prophetstown was an invitation to a massacre . The only thing that keptp198the Prophet safe was sheer numbers . Ten thousand Reds lived there now , more than had ever lived in any one place before . And it was a miraculous place , Ta-Kumsaw knew it . The maize grew up six ears to the stalk , thicker and milkier than any corn had ever been before . Buffalo and deer wandered into the city from a hundred miles around , walked to the cooking fires , and lay down waiting for the knife . When the geese flew overhead , a few from every flock would come to land on the Wobbish and the TippyCanoe , waiting for the arrow . The fish swam up from the Hio to leap into the nets of Prophetstown . All that would mean nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapeshot and shrapnel through the fragile wigwams and lodges of the Red city . The searingmetal would cut through the delicate walls  --  that deadly driven rain would not be held out by sticks and mud . Every Red man in Prophetstown would regret his Ta-Kumsaw deliberately set a killing pace , twice as fast as they had run before , bringing the boy and his brother to Mizogan . They had two hundred miles to Fort Detroit , and Ta-Kumsaw was determined to cover that distance in a single day . No White man could do it  --  no White man 's horse , either . A mile every five minutes , on and on , the wind whipping through the topknotof his hair . It would kill a man to run so fast for half an hour , except that the Red man called on the strength of the land to help him . The ground pushed back against his feet , adding to his strength . The bushes parted , making paths ; space appeared where there was no space ; Ta-Kumsawraced across streams and rivers so quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , merely sank just deep enough to find purchase on the water itself . His hungerto arrive at Fort Detroit was so strong that the land answered by feeding him , giving him strength . And not just Ta-Kumsaw , but every man behind him , every Red man who knew the feel of the land within him , he found the same strength as his leader , stepped in the same path , footfall by footfall , like one great soul walking a long slender highway through the wood.  |p199I  will have to carry the White boy , thought Ta-Kumsaw . But the footsteps behind him  --  for Whites made noise when they ran  --  kept up , falling into a rhythm identical with his own . That , of course , was not possible . The boy 's legs were too short , he had to take more strides to cover the same ground . Yet each step of Ta-Kumsaw 's was matched so closely that he heard the sound of the White boy 's feet as if they were his own . Minute after minute , mile after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun set behind them , over the left shoulder . The stars came out , but no moon , and the night was dark under the trees . Still they did n't slow , found their way easily through the wood , because it was n't their own eyes or their own mind finding the way , it was the land itself drawing them through the safe places in the darkness . Severaltimes in the night , Ta-Kumsaw noticed that the boy was no longer making noise . He called out in Shaw-Nee to the man who ran behind the White boy Alvin , and always the man answered , " He runs . " The moon came up , casting patches of dim light onto the forest floor . They overtook a storm  --  the ground grew moist under their feet , then wet ; they ran through showers , heavy rain , showers again , and then the land was dry . They never slackened their pace . The sky in the east turned grey , then pink , then blue , and the sun leapt upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands above the horizon when they saw the smoke of cookfires , then the slack fleur-de-lis flag , and finally the cross of the cathedral . Only then did they slow down . Only then did they break the perfect unison of their step , loose the grip of the land in their minds , and come to rest in a meadow so near the town that they could hear the organ playing in the cathedral . Ta-Kumsaw stopped , and the boy stopped behind him . How had Alvin , a White boy , traveled like a Red man through the night ? Ta-Kumsaw knelt before the boy . Though Alvin 's eyes were open , he seemed not to see anything . " Alvin , " said Ta-Kumsaw , speaking English . The boy did n't answer . " Alvin , are you asleep ' ? "  |p200Several  warriors gathered around . They were all somewhat quiet and spent from the journey . Not exhausted , because the land replenished them along the way . Their quiet was more from awe at having been so closely tied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy thing , a gift from the land to its noblest children . Many a Red had set out on such a journey and been turned away , forced to stop and sleep and rest and eat , stopped by darkness or bad weather , because his need for the journey was n't great enough , or his journey was contrary to what the land itself needed . Ta-Kumsaw , though , had never been refused ; they all knew it . This was much of the reasonTa-Kumsaw was held in as high esteem as his brother . The Prophet did miraculous things , but no one saw his visions ; he could only tell about them . What Ta-Kumsaw did , though , his warriors did with him , felt with him . Now , though , they were as puzzled by the White boy as Ta-Kumsaw was . Had Ta-Kumsaw sustained the boy by his own power ? Or had the land , unbelievably , reached out and supported a White child for his own sake ? " Is he White like his skin , or Red in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not in the quick way , but rather in the slow and holy language of the shamans . To Ta-Kumsaw 's surprise , Alvin responded to his words , looking at the man who spoke instead of staring straight ahead . " White , " murmured Alvin . He spoke English . " Does he speak our language ? " asked a man . Alvin appeared confused by the question . " Ta-Kumsaw , " he said . He looked up to see the angle of the sun . " It 's morning . Was I asleep ? " " Not asleep , " said Ta-Kumsaw in Shaw-Nee . Now the boy appeared not to understand at all . " Not asleep , " Ta-Kumsaw repeated in English . " I feel like I was asleep , " he said . " Only I 'm standing up . " " You do n't feel tired ? You do n't want to rest ? " " Tired ? Why would I be tired ? " Ta-Kumsaw did n't want to explain . If the boy did n't know what he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or perhaps there was something to what the Prophet had saidp201about him . That Ta-Kumsaw should teach him to be Red . If he could match grown Shaw-Nee , step for step , in such a run as that , perhaps this boy of all Whites could learn to feel the land . Ta-Kumsaw stood and spoke to the others . " I 'm going into the city , with only four others . " " And the boy , " said one . Others repeated his words . They all knew the Prophet 's promise to Ta-Kumsaw , that as long as the boy was with him he would n't die . Even if he were tempted to leave the boy behind , they 'd never let him do it . " And the boy , " Ta-Kumsaw agreed . Detroit was not a fort like the pathetic wooden stockadesof the Americans . It was made of stone , like the cathedral , with huge cannon pointing outward toward the river that connected Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair with Lake Canada , and smaller cannon aimed inland , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , not the fort , that impressed them . A dozen streets of houses , wooden ones , with shops and stores , and in the center of all , a cathedral so massive that it made a mockery of Reverend Thrower 's church . Blackrobedpriests went about their business like crows in the streets . The swarthy Frenchmen did n't show the same hostilitytoward Reds that Americans often seemed to have . Ta-Kumsaw understood that this was because the French in Detroit were n't there to settle . They did n't think of Reds as rivals for possession of the land . The French here were all biding their time till they went back to Europe , or at least back to the White-settled lands of Quebec and Ontarioacross the river ; except the trappers , of course , and for them the Reds were not enemies , either . Trappers held Reds in awe , trying to learn how Reds found game so easily , when the trappers had such a devilish time knowing where to lay their snares . They thought , as White men always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds performed , and if they only studied Red men long enough , these White trappers would learn how to do it . They would never learn . How could the land accept the kind of man who would kill every beaver in a pond , just for the pelts , leaving the meat to rot , and no beaver left to bear young ?  |p202No  wonder the bears killed these trappers whenever they could . The land rejected them . When I have driven the Americans from the land west of the mountains , thought Ta-Kumsaw , then I will drive out the Yankees from New England , and the Cavaliers from the Crown Colonies . And when they 're all gone , I 'll turn to the Spanish of Florida and the French of Canada . Today I 'll make use of you for my own purpose , but tomorrow I 'll drive you out , too . Every White face that stays in this land will stay here because it 's dead . And in that day , beavers will die only when the land tells them it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Detroit was officially de Maurepas , but Ta-Kumsaw avoided him whenever he could . It was only the second man , Napoleon Bonaparte , who was worth talking to . " I heard you were at Lake Mizogan , " said Napoleon . He spoke in French , of course , but Ta-Kumsaw had learned French at the same time he was learning English , and from the same person . " Come , sit down . " Napoleon looked with vague interest at the White boy Alvin , but said nothing to him . " I was there , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " So was my brother . " " Ah . But was there an army ? " " The seed of one , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " I gave up arguingwith Tenskwa-Tawa . I 'll make an army out of other tribes . " " When ! " demanded Napoleon . " You come here two , three times each year , you tell me you 're going to have an army . Do you know how long I 've waited ? Four years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many years , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " You 'll have your battle . " " Before my hair turns grey ? Tell me that ! Do I have to be dying of old age before you 'll call out a general rising of the Reds ? You know how helpless I am . La Fayette and de Maurepas wo n't let me go more than fifty miles from here , wo n't give me any troops at all . There has to be an army first , they say . The Americans have to have some main force that you can fight with . Well , thep203only thing that will cause those miserably independent bastardsto unite is you . " " I know , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " You promised me an army of ten thousand Reds , Ta-Kumsaw . Instead I keep hearing about a city of ten thousand Quakers ! " " Not Quakers . " " If they renounce war it amounts to the same thing . " Suddenly Napoleon let his voice become soft , loving , persuasive . " Ta-Kumsaw , I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Ta-Kumsaw laughed . Napoleon learned long ago that his tricks worked on White men , but not half so well on Reds , and on Ta-Kumsaw not at all . " You care nothing for me , and I care nothing for you , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " You want one battle and a victory , so you can go home a hero to Paris . I want one battle and a victory , so I can strike terror into White men 's hearts and bring together an even greater army of Reds under my command , to sweepthe land south of here and drive the Englishmen back across the mountains . One battle , one victory  --  that 's why we work together , and when that 's done I 'll never think of you again , and you 'll never think of me . " Napoleon was angry , but he laughed . " Half true , " he said . " I wo n't care about you , but I 'll think of you . I 've learned from you , Ta-Kumsaw . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of country , and love of country better than the hope of glory , and the hope of glory better than looting , and looting better than wages . But best of all is to fight for a cause . A great and noble dream . I 've always had the love of my men . They would die for me . But for a cause , they 'd let their wives and children die and think it was worth the price . " " How did you learn that from me ? " said Ta-Kumsaw . " That 's my brother 's talk , not mine . " " Your brother ? I thought he did n't think anything was worth dying for . " " No , he 's very free with dying . It 's killing he wo n't do . " Napoleon laughed , and Ta-Kumsaw laughed with hin ) . " You 're right , you know . We 're not friends . But Ip204do like you . What puzzles me is this  --  when you 've won , and all the White men are gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribes go back to the way they were before , separate , quarreling , weak . " " Happy . That 's how we were before . Many tribes , many languages , but one living land . " " Weak , " said Napoleon again . " If I ever brought all of my land under my flag , Ta-Kumsaw , I 'd hold them togetherso long and so tightly that they 'd become one great  --  people , great and strong . And if I ever do that , you can count on this . We 'll be back , and take your land away from you , just like every other land on Earth . Count on it . " " That 's because you are evil , General Bonaparte . You want to bend everything and everybody to your obe-dience . " " That is n't evil , foolish savage . If everybody obeyed me , then they 'd be happy and safe , at peace , and , for the first time in all of history , free . " " Safe , unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free , unless they wanted something contrary to your will . " " Imagine , a Red man philosophizing . Do those peasantsquatters south of here know that you 've read Newton , Voltaire , Rousseau , and Adam Smith ? " " I do n't think they know I can read their languages . " Napoleon leaned across his desk . " We 'll destroy them , Ta-Kumsaw , you and I together . But you have to bring me an army . " " My brother prophesies that we 'll have that army before the year ends . " " A prophecy ? " " All his prophecies come true . " " Does he say we 'll win ? " Ta-Kumsaw laughed . " He says you 'll be known as the greatest European general who ever lived . And I will be known as the greatest Red . " Napoleon ran his fingers through his hair and smiled , almost boyish now ; he could pass from menacing to friendly to adorable in moments . " That seems to dodge the question . Dead men can be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose battles are never called great , are they ? Noble , perhaps , even heroic . But not great . " " True , Ta-Kumsaw , true . But your brother is being coy . Oracular . Delphic . " " I do n't know those words . " " Of course you do n't . You 're a savage . " Napoleon poured wine . " I forget myself . Wine ? " Ta-Kumsaw shook his head . " I suppose none for the boy , " said Napoleon . " He 's only ten , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " In France , that means we water the wine half and half . What are you doing with a White boy , Ta-Kumsaw ? Are you capturing children now ? " " This White boy , " said Ta-Kumsaw , " he 's more than he seems . " " In a loincloth he does n't look like much . Does he understand French ? " " Not a word , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " I came to ask you  --  can you give us guns ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't fight bullets with arrows , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " La Fayette refuses to authorize us to issue you any guns . Paris agrees with him . They do n't trust you . They 're afraid any guns they give you might someday be turned against us . " " Then what good will it do me to raise an army ? " Napoleon smiled , sipped his wine . " I 've been speaking to some Irrakwa traders . " " The Irrakwa are the urine of sick dogs , " said Takumsaw . " They were cruel , vicious animals before the White man came , and they are worse now . " " Odd . The English seemed to find them to be kindred spirits . And La Fayette adores them . All that matters now , though , is this : They manufacture guns , in large numbers , cheaply . Not the most reliable weapons , but they use exactlythe same size ammunition . It means they can make hills that fit the barrel more tightly , with better aim . And yet they sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us ? " " No . You 'll buy them . "  | " We do n't have money . " " Pelts , " said Napoleon . " Beaver pelts . Minks . Deerhidesand buffalo leather . " Ta-Kumsaw shook his head . " We ca n't ask these animalsto die for the sake of guns . " " Too bad , " said Napoleon . " You Reds have a knack for hunting , I 've been told . " " True Reds do . The Irrakwa do n't . They 've used White man 's machines so long now that they 're dead to the land , just like White men . Or they 'd go and get the pelts they want for themselves . " " There 's something else they want . Besides pelts , " said Napoleon . " We do n't have anything they want . " " Iron , " said Napoleon . " We do n't have iron . " " No . But they know where it is . In the upper reaches of the Mizzipy , and along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake . All they want is your promise that you wo n't harm their boats bringing iron ore back to Irrakwa , or their miners as they dig it out of the earth . " " Peace for the future , in exchange for guns , now ? " " Yes , " said Napoleon . " Are n't they afraid that I 'll turn the guns against them ? " " They ask you to promise that you wo n't . " Ta-Kumsaw considered this . " Tell them this . I promisethat if they give us guns , not one of the guns will ever be used against any Irrakwa . All my men will take this oath . And we will never attack any of their boats on the water , or their miners as they dig in the earth . " " You mean that ? " asked Napoleon . " If I said it , I meant it , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " As much as you hate them ? " " I hate them because the land hates them . When the White man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sick , then earthquakes can swallow up miners , and storms can sink boats , and the Irrakwa will become true Red men again or they will die . Once the White man is gone , the land will be stern with its children who remain . " The meeting was soon finished after that . Ta-Kumsawp207got up and shook hands with the general . Alvin surprised them both by also stepping forward and offering his hand . Napoleon shook hands with him , amused . " Tell the boy he keeps dangerous company , " he said . Ta-Kumsaw translated . Alvin looked at him with wide eyes . " Does he mean you ? " he asked . " I think so , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " But he 's the most dangerous man in the world , " said Alvin . Napoleon laughed when Ta-Kumsaw translated the boy 's words . " How can I be dangerous ? A little man stuck away out here in the middle of the wilderness , when the center of the world is Europe , great wars are fought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't need to translate  --  the boy understoodfrom Napoleon 's tone and expression . " He 's so dangerousbecause he makes people love him without deserving it . " Ta-Kumsaw felt the truth in the boy 's words . That was what Napoleon did to White men , and it was dangerous , dangerous and evil and dark . Is this the man I rely on to help me ? To be my ally ? Yes , he is , because I have no choice . Ta-Kumsaw did n't translate what the boy said , even though Napoleon insisted . So far the French general had not attempted to cast his spell on the boy . If he knew the boy 's words , he might try , and it just might capture Alvin . Ta-Kumsaw was coming to appreciate what the boy was . Perhaps the boy was too strong for Napoleon to charm him . Or perhaps the boy would become an adoring slave like de Maurepas . Better not to find out . Better to take the boy away . Alvin insisted on seeing the cathedral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the place , but another rebuked him and welcomed them inside . Ta-Kumsaw was always amused by the statues of the saints . Whenever possible , the statues were shown being tortured in the most gruesome ways . White could talk all day about how barbaric it was , the Red practice of torturingcaptives so they could show courage . Yet whose statuesdid they kneel at to pray ? People who showed courage tinder torture . There was no making sense of White men.  |p208He  and Alvin talked about this on their way out of the city , not hurrying at all now . He also explained to the boy something of how they were able to run so far , so quickly . And how remarkable it was for a White boy to keep up with them . Alvin seemed to understand how Red men lived within the land ; at least he tried . " I think I felt that . While I was running . It 's like I 'm not in myself . My thoughts are wandering all over . Like dreaming . And while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Feeding it , using it , taking it wherever it wants to go . Is that what you feel ? " That was n't at all what Ta-Kumsaw felt . When the land came into him , it was like he was more alive than ever ; not absent from his body , but more strongly present in it than at any other time . But he did n't explain this to the boy . Instead he turned the question back to Alvin . " You say it 's like dreaming . What did you dream last night ? " " I dreamed again about a lot of the visions I saw when I was in the crystal tower with the Shining  --  with the Prophet . " " The Shining Man . I know you call him that  --  he told me why . " " I dreamed those things again . Only it was different . I could see some things more clearly now , and other things I forgot . " " Did you dream anything you had n't seen before ? " " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man we visited , the general . And something even stranger . A big hill , almost round  --  no , with eight sides . I remember that , it was real clear . A hill with eight straight sides to it , sloping down . Inside it there was a whole city , lots of little rooms , like in anthills , only people-sized . Or anyway bigger than ants . And I was on top of it , wanderingaround in all these strange trees  --  they had silver leaves , not green  --  and I was looking for my brother . For Measure . " Ta-Kumsaw said nothing for a long time . But he thought many things . No White man had ever seen that place  --  the land was still strong enough to keep them from finding that . Yet this boy had dreamed of it . And a dreamp209of Eight-Face Mound never came by chance . It alwaysmeant something . It always meant the same thing . " We have to go there , " Ta-Kumsaw said . " Where ? " " To the hill you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a place ? " " No White man has ever seen it . For a White man to stand there would be  --  filthy . " Alvin did n't answer that . What could he say ? Ta-Kumsaw swallowed hard . " But if you dream of it , you have to go . " " What is it ? " Ta-Kumsaw shook his head . " The place you dreamed of . That 's all . If you want to know more , dream again . " It was near night when they reached the camp ; wigwamshad been erected , because it looked like more rain tonight . The others insisted that Ta-Kumsaw share a hut with Alvin , for his safety 's sake . But Ta-Kumsaw did n't want to . The boy made him afraid . The land was doing things with this boy , and not giving Ta-Kumsaw any idea what was happening . But when you saw yourself at the Eight-Face Mound in your dreams , you had no choice but to go . And since Alvin could never find the way alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the others , and even if he could , he would n't do it . Word would get out that TaKumsawhad taken a White to the ancient holy place , and then many Reds would refuse to listen to Ta-Kumsaw anymore . So in the morning he told the others he was taking the boy off to teach him , as the Prophet had told him he must . " Meet Meet me in five days where the Pickawee flows into the Ilio , " he told them . " From there we 'll go south to talk to the Chok-Taw and the Chicky-Saw . " Take us with you , they said . You wo n't be safe alone . But he did n't answer them , and soon enough they gave up . He set off at a run , and once again Alvin fell in step behind him , matching him stride for stride . It was almost as far again as the journey from Mizogan to Detroit . By nightfall they would be at the edge of the Land of Flints. ' fa-Kumsaw planned to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring to lead a White boy to Eight-Face Mound.  |p211MEASURE  HEARD THEM COMING only seconds before the door swung open and light flooded the root cellar . Time enough to dump out the dirt and tuck his loincloth into the deerhide belt , then scramble forward onto the potatoes . The breechclout was so filthy it was like wearing dirt , but this was n't a time to get finicky . They did n't waste no time on prison inspection , so they did n't see the hole that was now reaching a good two feet under the back wall . Instead they reached in and drug him out by the armpits , slamming the root cellar doors shut behind him . The light was so sudden it dazzled him , and he could n't make out who had him , or how many they were . Did n't much matter . Anyone local would have known him right off , so they had to be Harrison 's boys , and once he knew that , he knew it was n't nothing good going to happen to him . " Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a Red . " " You put me in a hole in the ground , " said Measure . " I ai n't about to come out clean . " " I I gave you one long night to think about it , boy , " said Harrison . " Now you got to make up your mind . There 's two ways you can be useful to me . One is alive , you telling all about how they tortured your brother to death , him screaming every second . You make it a good story , and you tell all about how Ta-Kumsaw and thep212Prophet were there , getting their own hands into the boy 's blood . You tell a story like that , and it 's worth keeping you alive . " " Ta-Kumsaw saved my life from your Chok-Taw Reds , " said Measure . " That 's the only story I 'll tell . Exceptto mention how you wanted me to tell another story . " " That 's what I thought , " said Harrison . " Fact is , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way , I reckon I wouldn't 've believed you . So we both agree  --  it 's the other choice . " Measure knew Harrison meant to produce his body , with the evidence of torture on it . Dead , he could n't tell anybody who did the cutting and burning . Well , thought Measure , you 'll see I die as brave as any man . But because he was n't one to welcome death with both hands , he thought he 'd give talking a bit more of a try . " You let me go and call off this war , Harrison , and I 'll keep my mouth shut . Just let me wander in , and you allow as how it was all a terrible mistake and take your boys on home and leave Prophetstown in peace , and I wo n't tell a word otherwise . That 's a lie I 'm glad to tell . " Harrison hesitated just a moment , and Measure allowed himself to hope he might actually have some spark of godliness left in him , to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Then Harrison smiled , shook his head , and waved his hand at a big ugly riverman standing right up against the wall . " Mike Fink , this here 's a renegade White boy , who has joined in with all the evil doings of Ta-Kumsaw and his gang of child-killers and wife-rapers . I hope you 'll break several of his bones . " Fink stood there , contemplating . " I reckon he 'll make a powerful lot of noise , Gov . " " Well , jam in a gag on him . " Harrison took a kerchiefout of his own coat pocket . " Here , stuff this in his mouth and tie it there . " Fink complied . Measure tried to keep his eyes off him , tried to calm the dread that made his belly so tight and his bladder so full . The kerchief filled his mouth so full he choked on it . He only got control of himself by breathing slow and steady through his nose . Fink tied hisp213own red scarf so tight around Measure 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther ; again it took all his concentration just to breathe evenly and stop from gaggingand retching . If he did that , he 'd sure breathe that kerchief right down into his lungs , and then he would die . Which was a crazy thought , seeing as how Harrison meant to have him dead no matter what . Maybe choking on a kerchief would be better than the pain Fink meant to cause . But Measure had too strong a spark of life to choose to die like that . Pain or not , when he died he 'd go out gasping , not smothering himself just to get off easy . " Breaking his bones ai n't the way Reds do it . " Fink was being helpful . " They usually cut and bum . " " Well , we do n't have time for cutting , and you can burn the body after he 's dead . The point of this is to have a colorful corpse , Mike , not to cause this boy pain . We 're not savages , or at least some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out , took Measure by the shoulder , and kicked his feet out from under him . Measure never felt so helpless in his life as in that moment when he fell . Fink did n't have an inch of height or reach on him , and Measure knew a few wrassling tricks , but Fink never even tried to grapple with him . Just a grab and a kick , and Measure was on the floor . " Do n't you need to tie him first ? " asked Harrison . In answer , Fink picked up Measure 's left leg so fast and high that Measure slid across the floor and his buttockslifted right into the air . No chance to get leverage , no chance to kick . Then Fink brought Measure 's leg down across his own thigh hard and sharp . His leg bones snapped like dry kindling wood . Measure screamed into the gag , then nearly inhaled the kerchief gasping for breath . He never felt pain like that in all his life . For one crazy moment he thought , This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not in here , " said Harrison . " Take him out back . I ) o it in the root cellar . " " How many bones you want me to break ? " asked Fink . " All of them . " Fink picked Measure up by an arm and a leg and prac/tically tossed him up over his shoulders . Despite the pain , Measure tried to lay in a punch or two , but Fink jerked down on his arm , breaking it right at the elbow . Measure was barely conscious the rest of the way outside . He heard somebody in the distance call , " Who you got there ! " Fink yelled back , " Caught us a Red spy , sneaking around ! " The voice from the distance sounded familiar to Measure , but he could n't concentrate well enough to remember who it was . " Tear him apart ! " he shouted . Fink did n't answer . He did n't set Measure down to open the root cellar doors , even though they were low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down , then pull them up . Fink just hooked the toe of his boot under the door and flipped it up . It moved so fast it banged on the ground and rebounded so as to nearly close again , but by then Fink was already stepping into the cellar ; the door hit his thigh and bounced right open again . Measure just heard it as banging and a little jostling , which made his leg and his elbow hurt all the more . Why have n't I fainted yet , he wondered . Now 's as good a time as any . But he never did faint . Both legs broken above and below the knee , his fingers bent back and disjointed , his hands crushed , his arms broken above and below the elbows  --  throughall that he stayed awake , though the pain eventually got kind of far away , more like the memory of pain than pain itself . If you hear one cymbal crash , it 's loud ; two or three cymbal crashes at once are louder yet . But along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder , you just get deafer , and you hardly hear any of them at all . That 's how it was for Measure . There was a sound of cheering in the distance . Somebody ran up . " Governor says finish up real quick , he wants you right away . " " I 'll be done in a minute , " said Fink . " Except for the burning . " " Save it till later , " the man said . " Hurry ! " Fink dropped Measure , then stomped his chest till his ribs were pretty much broke , bending in and out any which way . Then he picked him up by the arm and thep215hair and bit off his ear . Measure felt it tear away with one last desperate surge of anger . Then Fink gave his head a sharp twist . Measure heard his own neck snap . Fink flung him onto the potatoes . He rolled down the backside and into the hole he dug . Only when his face was in the dirt did the pain stop and darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slid the bar into place , and headed back to the house . The cheering out front was louder . Harrison met him coming out of his office . " Never mind about that now , " Harrison said . " There 's no need for a corpse to keep things hot around here . The cannon just got here , and we 'll attack in the morning . " Harrison rushed out to the front porch , and Mike Fink followed him . Cannon ? What did cannons have to do with needing or not needing a corpse ? What did he think Mike was , an assassin ? Killing Hooch was one thing , and killing a man in a fair fight was something else . But killing a young man with a gag in his mouth , that was altogether different . When he bit off that ear it just did n't feel right . It was n't no trophy of a fair fight . Took the heart right out of him . He did n't even bother biting off the other ear . Mike stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right along , brisk as you please . He knew how Harrison would use the guns , he 'd heard him planning it . Two here , two there , so they rake the whole Red city from both sides . Grape and canister , to rip and tear the bodies of the Reds , women and children right along with the men . It ai n't my kind of a fight , thought Mike . Like that man out back . No challenge at all , like stomping baby frogs . You can do it , and not think twice . But you do n't pick up the dead frogs , stuff them , and hang them on the wall , you just do n't do that . It ai n't my kind of fight.  |p217THERE  WAS A DIFFERENT FEEL to the land around LickingRiver . Alvin did n't notice right off , mostly cause he was running with his wick trimmed , so to speak . Did n't notice much at all . It was one long dream as he ran . But as TaKumsawled him into the Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All around him , no matter what he saw in his dream , there was little sparks of deep-black fire . Not like the nothingness that always lurked at the edges of his vision . Not like the deep black that sucked light into itself and never let it go . No , this black shone , it gave off sparks . And when they stopped running , and Alvin came to hisself again , those black fires may have faded just a bit but they were still there . Without so much as thinking , Alvin walked toward one , a black blaze in a sea of green , reached down and picked it up . A flint . A good big one . " A twenty-arrow flint , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " It shines black and bums cold , " said Alvin . Ta-Kumsaw nodded . " You want to be a Red boy ? Then make arrowheads with me . " Alvin caught on quick . He had worked with stone before . When he cut a millstone , he wanted smooth , flat surfaces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that counted . His first two arrowheads were clumsy , but then he was able to feel his way into the stone and find the natural creases and folds , and then break them apart . Forp218his fourth arrowhead , he did n't chip at all . Just used his fingers and gently pulled the arrowhead away from the flint . Ta-Kumsaw 's face showed no expression . That 's what most White folks thought he looked like all the time . They thought Red men , and most especially Ta-Kumsaw , never felt nothing cause they never let nobody see their feelings . Alvin had seen him laugh , though , and cry , and all the other faces that a man can show . So he knowed that when Ta-Kumsaw showed nothing on his face , that meant he was feeling a whole lot of things . " I worked with stone a lot before , " said Alvin . He felt like he was sort of apologizing . " Flint is n't stone , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Pebbles in the river , boulders , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in it , the hard earth that the land gives to us freely . Not hewn out and tortured the way White men do with iron . " He held up Alvin 's fourth arrowhead , the one he cajoled out of the flint with his fingers . " Steel can never have an edge this sharp . " " It 's just about as perfect an edge as I ever saw , " said Al . " No chip marks , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " No pressing . A Red man would see this flint and say , The land grew the flint this way . " " But you know better , " said Al . " You know it 's just a knack I got . " " A knack bends the land , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Like a snag in the river churns the water on the river 's face . So it is with the land when a White uses his knack . Not you . " Alvin puzzled on that for a minute . " You mean you can see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Like the bad stink when a sick man loosens his bowel , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " But you  --  what you do is clean . Like part of the land . I thought I would teach you how to be Red . Instead the land gives you arrowheads like a gift . " Again , Alvin felt like apologizing . It seemed to make Ta-Kumsaw angry , that he could do the things he did . " It ai n't like I asked anybody for this , " he said . " I was justp219the seventh son of a seventh son , and the thirteenth child . " " These numbers  --  seven , thirteen  --  you Whites care about them , but they 're nothing in the land . The land has true numbers . One , two , three , four , five , six  --  these numbers you can find when you stand in the forest and look around you . Where is seven ? Where is thirteen ? " " Maybe that 's why they 're so strong , " said Alvin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then why does the land love this unnatural thing that you do ? " " I do n't know , Ta-Kumsaw . I 'm only ten going on eleven . " Ta-Kumsaw laughed . " Ten ? Eleven ? Very weak numbers . " They spent the night there , in the borders of the Land of Flints . Ta-Kumsaw told Alvin the story of that place , how it was the best flint country in the whole land . No matter how many flints the Reds came and took away , more always came out of the ground , just lying there to get picked up . In years gone by , every now and then some tribe would try to own the place . They 'd bring their warriors and kill anyone else who came for flints . That way they figured they 'd have arrows and the other tribes would n't have any . But it never worked right . Cause as soon as that tribe won its battles and held the land , the flints just plain disappeared . Not a one . Members of that tribe would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd go away , and another tribe would come in , and there 'd be flints again , as many as ever . " It belongs to everybody , this place . All Reds are at peace here . No killing , no war , no quarrels  --  or the tribe has no flints . " " I wish the whole world was a place like that , " said Alvin . " Listen to my brother long enough , White boy , andyou 'll start to think it is . No , no , do n't explain to me . Do n't defend him . He takes his road , I take mine . I thinkhis way will kill more people , Red or White , than mine . " In the night , Alvin dreamed . He saw himself walk allthe way around Eight-Face Mound , until he found a placep220where a path seemed to lead up the steep hill . He climbed , then , and came to the top . The silver-leafed trees shook in the breeze , blinding him as the sun shone off them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a nest of redbirds . Every tree the same , a single redbird nest . Except one tree . It was different from the others . It was older , gnarled , with spreading branches instead of the up-reaching kind . Like a fruit tree . And the leaves were gold , not silver , so they did n't shine so bright , but they were soft and deep . In the tree , he saw round white fruit , and he knew that it was ripe . But when he reached out his hand to take the fruit , and eat it , he could hear laughter , jeering . He looked around him and saw everybody he ever knowed in his whole life , laughing at him . Except one  --  Taleswapper . Taleswapper was standing there , and he said , " Eat . " Alvin reached up and plucked a single fruit out of the tree and took it to his lips and bit into it . It was juicy and firm , and the taste was sweet and bitter , salt and sour all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over  --  but good , a taste he wanted to hold inside him forever . He was about to take a second bite when he saw that the fruit was gone from his hand , and not a one hung from the tree . " One bite is all you need for now , " said Taleswapper . " Remember how it tastes . " " I 'll never forget , " said Alvin . Everybody was still laughing , louder than ever ; but Alvin paid them no mind . He 'd took him a bite of the fruit , and all he wanted now was to bring his family to the same tree , and let them eat ; to bring everybody he ever knowed , and even strangers , too , and let them taste it . If they 'd just taste it , Alvin figured , they 'd know . " What would they know ? " asked Taleswapper . Al could n't think what it was . " Just know , " he said . " Know everything . Everything that 's good . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first bite , you know . " " What about the second bite ? " " With the second bite , you live forever , " said Taleswapper . " And that is n't a thing you 'd better plan on doing , my boy . Do n't ever imagine you can live forever . " Alvin woke up that morning with the taste of the fruitp221still in his mouth . He had to force himself to believe that it was just a dream . Ta-Kumsaw was already up . He had a low fire going , and he had called two fish out of the LickingRiver . Now they were spitted with sticks down their mouths . He handed one to Alvin . But Alvin did n't want to eat . If he did , the taste of the fruit would go out of his mouth . He 'd begin to forget , and he wanted to remember . Oh , he knowed that he 'd have to eat sometime  --  a body can get remarkable thin saying no to food all the time . But today , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he held the spit and watched the trout sizzle . TaKumsawtalked , telling him about calling fish and other animals when you need to eat . Asking them to come . If the land wants you to eat , then they come ; or maybe some other animal , it does n't matter , just so you eat what the land gives you . Alvin thought about the fish he was roasting . Did n't the land know he was n't going to eat this morning ? Or did it send this fish to tell him he ought to eat after all ? Neither one . Because just at the moment the fish were ready to eat , they heard the crashing and thumping that told them a White man was coming . Ta-Kumsaw sat very still , but he did n't so much as pull out hi6 knife . " If the land brings a White man here , then he is n't my enemy , " said Ta-Kumsaw . In a few seconds , the White man stepped into the clearing . His hair was white , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a slack-looking pouch over his shoulder , and no weapon at all . Alvin knew right off what was in that pouch . A change of clothes , a few snatches of food , and a book . A third of the book containedsingle sentences , where folks had written down the most important thing they ever saw happen with their own eyes . The last two-thirds of the book , though , were sealed with a leather strap . That was where Taleswapper wrote down his own stories , the ones he believed and thought were important . Cause that 's who it was , Taleswapper , who Alvin never thought to see again in his life . And suddenly , seeing that old friend , Alvin knew why two fish came atp222Ta-Kumsaw 's call . " Taleswapper , " Alvin said , " I hope you 're hungry , cause I got a fish here that I roasted for you . " Taleswapper smiled . " I 'm right glad to see you , Alvin , and right glad to see that fish . " Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass , across the fire from Alvin and Ta-Kumsaw . " Thank you kindly , Alvin , " said Taleswapper . He pulled out his knife and neatly began flaking off slices of fish . They sizzled his lips , but he just licked and smacked and made short work of the trout . Ta-Kumsaw also ate his , and Alvin watched them both . Ta-Kumsaw never took his eyes off Taleswapper . " This is Taleswapper , " Alvin said . " He 's the man who taught me how to heal . " " I did n't teach you , " said Taleswapper . " I just gave you some idea how to teach yourself . And persuaded you that you ought to try . " Taleswapper directed his next sentenceat Ta-Kumsaw . " He was set to let himself die before he 'd use his knack to heal himself , can you believe that ? " " And this is Ta-Kumsaw , " said Alvin . " Oh , I knew that the minute I saw you . Do you know what a legend you are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they admire you more than they admire their own leaders , even though they know you 're sworn to fight until you 've driven the last White man out of America . " Ta-Kumsaw said nothing . " I 've met maybe two dozen children named after you , most of them boys , all of them White . And stories  --  about you saving White captives from being burned to death , about you bringing food to people you drove out of their homes , so they would n't starve . I even believe some of those stories . " Ta-Kumsaw finished his fish and laid the spit in the fire . " I also heard a story as I was coming here , about how you captured two Whites from Vigor Church and sent their bloody torn-up clothes to their parents . How you tortured them to death to show how you meant to destroy every White  --  man , woman , and child . How you said the timep223for being civilized was past , and now you 'd use pure terror to drive the White man out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , Ta-Kumsawspoke . " Did you believe that story ? " " Well , I did n't , " said Taleswapper . " But that 's because I already knew the truth . You see , I got a message from a girl I knew  --  a young lady now , she is . It was a letter . " He took a folded letter from his coat , three sheets of paper covered with writing . He handed them to TaKumsaw . Without looking at it , Ta-Kumsaw handed the letter to Alvin . " Read it to me , " he said . " But you can read English , " said Alvin . " Not here , " said Ta-Kumsaw . Alvin looked at the letter , at all three pages of it , and to his surprise he could n't read it either . The letters all looked familiar . When he studied them out , he could even name them  --  **31;15749;TOOLONG , that 's how it started , but it made no sense to Al at all , he could n't even say for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it either , " he said , and handed it back to Taleswapper . Taleswapper studied it for a minute , then laughed and put it back into his coat pocket . " Well , that 's a story for my book . A place where a man ca n't read . " To Alvin 's surprise , Ta-Kumsaw smiled . " Even you ? " " I know what it says , because I read it before , " said ' Faleswapper . " But I ca n't make out a single word of it today . Even when I know what the word is supposed to he . What is this place ? " " We 're in the Land of Flints , " said Alvin . " We 're in the shadow of Eight-Face Mound , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " I did n't think a White man could get here , " said Taleswapper . " Neither did I , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " But here is a White boy , and there is a White man . " " I dreamed you last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of Eight-Face Mound , and you were with me , explaining things to me.  | " Do n't count on it , " said Taleswapper . " I doubt there 's a thing on Eight-Face Mound that I could explain to anybody . " " How did you come here , " asked Ta-Kumsaw , " if you did n't know you were coming to the Land of Flints ? " " She told me to come up the Musky-Ingum , and when I saw a white boulder on the right , I should take the fork that led left . She said I 'd find Alvin Miller Junior sitting with Ta-Kumsaw by a fire , roasting fish . " " Who told you all this ? " asked Alvin . " A woman , " said Taleswapper . " A torch . She told me you saw her in a vision , Alvin , inside a crystal tower , not more than a week ago by now . She was the one who pulled the caul from your face , when you were born . She 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees . She went inside that tower with you and saw out of your eyes . " " The Prophet said someone was with us , " said Alvin . " She looked out of his eye , too , " said Taleswapper , " and she saw all his futures . The Prophet will die . Tomorrow morning . Shot by your own father 's gun , Alvin . " " No ! " cried Alvin . " Unless , " said Taleswapper . " Unless Measure comes in time to show your father that he 's alive , that Ta-Kumsaw and the Prophet never harmed him , or you either . " " But Measure left days ago ! " " That 's right , Alvin . But he got captured by GovernorHarrison 's men . Harrison has him , and today , maybe even right now , one of Harrison 's men is killing him . Breaking his bones , breaking his neck . Tomorrow Harrisonwill attack Prophetstown with his cannon , killing everybody . Every soul . So much blood that the TippyCanoewill flow scarlet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta-Kumsaw leaped to his feet . " I have to go back . I have to  --  " " You know how far you are , " said Taleswapper . " You know where your warriors are . Even if you ran all night and all day , as fast as you Reds can go  --  "  | " Noon tomorrow , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " He 'll be dead already , " said Taleswapper . Ta-Kumsaw shouted in anguish , so loud that several birds cried out and flew away from the meadow . " Now , hold your horses , just wait a minute . If there were nothing we could do , she would n't very well have sent me on this chase , now , would she ? Do n't you see we 're acting out a plan that 's bigger than all of us ? Why did it happen that Alvin and Measure were the two boys that Harrison 's hired Chok-Taw kidnapped ? How do you happen to be here , and me also , at the very day when we 're most needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta-Kumsaw . " I do n't think so , " said Taleswapper . " I think that if they needed us there , then there we 'd be . They need us here . " " You 're like my brother , trying to make me fit into his plans ! " " I wish I were like your brother . He has visions and sees what 's going on , while all I get is a letter from a torch . But here I am , and here you are , and if we were n't supposed to be here , we just plain would n't , whether you like it or not . " Alvin did n't like this talk of what was supposed to happen . Who was doing all this supposing ? What did Taleswapper mean  --  they were all poppets on sticks ? Was somebody making them move any old way , whatever he felt ought to happen ? " If somebody 's so all-fired in charge of everything , " said Alvin , " he has n't been doing too good a job of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taleswapper grinned . " You really do n't take to religion , do you , boy ? " " I just do n't think anybody 's making us do any-thing . " " Nor did I say so , " said Taleswapper . " I 'm just sayingthings never get so bad we ca n't do something to make them better . " " Well I 'll be glad to take suggestions . What did this torch lady think I ought to do ? " asked Alvin . " She said you 're supposed to climb the mountain and heal Measure . Do n't ask me more than that  --  that 's all shep226said . There is n't a mountain worthy of the name in these parts , and Measure 's in the root cellar behind Vinegar Riley 's house  --  " " I know that place , " said Alvin . " I been there . But I ca n't  --  I mean I 've never tried to heal somebody who was n't right there in front of me . " " Enough talking , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This man came to tell you to go up the mountain . Everything begins when you climb the Mound . If you can . " " Some things end on Eight-Face Mound , " said Taleswapper . " What does a White man know about this place ? " asked Ta-Kumsaw . " Not a thing , " said Taleswapper . " But I knelt by the bed of a dying Irrakwa woman , many years ago , and she told me that the most important thing in her life was , she was the last Irrakwa ever to stand inside Eight-Face Mound . " " The Irrakwa have all turned White in their hearts , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Eight-Face Mound would never let them in now . " " But I 'm White , " said Alvin . " Very good problem , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " The Mound will tell you the answer . Maybe the answer is you do n't go up and everybody dies . Come . " He led them along the path the land opened up for them , until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brambles . There was no path . " This is Red Man 's Face , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " This is where Red men climb . The path is gone . You ca n't climb here . " " Where , then ? " asked Alvin . " How do I know ? " said Ta-Kumsaw . " The story is that if you climb a different face , you find a different Mound . The story is that if you climb the Builders ' Face , you find their ancient city , still alive on the Mound . If you climb the Beasts ' Face , you find a land where a giant buffalois king , a strange animal with horns that come out of his mouth and a nose like a terrible snake , and huge cougarswith teeth as long as spears all bow before him andp227worship . Who knows if these stories are true ? No one climbs those faces now . " " Is there a White Man 's Face ? " asked Alvin . " Red Man , Medicine , Builder , Beast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Maybe one of them is White Man 's Face . Come . " He led them around the hill . The Mound rose on their left hand . No path opened . Alvin recognized everything they saw . His dream last night was true , at least this much : Taleswapper was with him , and he circled the Mound beforeclimbing . They came to the last of the unknown faces . No path . Alvin made as if to go on to the next face . " No use , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " All eight faces , none will let us up . The next is Red Man 's Face again . " " I know , " said Alvin . " But here 's the path . " There it was , straight as an arrow . Right on the edge shared by Red Man 's Face and the unknown face beside it . " You are half Red , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Go on up , " said Taleswapper . " In my dream you were with me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Taleswapper . " But the fact is , I ca n't see this path the two of you are talking about . It looks just like all the rest of the faces . So I reckon I 'm not invited . " " Go , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " Hurry . " " You come with me , then , " said Alvin . " You see the path , do n't you ? " " I did n't dream of the Mound , " said Ta-Kumsaw . " And what you see there , it will be half what the Red man sees , and half a new place that I should never see . Go now , do n't waste time anymore . My brother and your brother will die unless you do whatever it is the land brought you here to do . " " I 'm thirsty , " said Al . " Drink there , " said Ta-Kumsaw , " if the Mound offersyou water . Eat if the Mound offers you food . " Al set his feet on the path and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were roots to grab , plenty ofp228footholds , and before long the path crested , leveled , and the underbrush ended . He had thought the Mound was a single hill , with eight slopes . Now , though , he could see that each of the eight slopes was a separate Mound , arranged to form a deep bowl in the middle . The valley seemed much too large , the farthest Mounds much too far away . Had n't Alvinwalked around the entire Mound this morning with TaKumsawand Taleswapper ? Eight-Face Mound was much more inside than it seemed to be outside . He walked carefully down the grassy slope . It was tufted , irregular , the grass cool , the soil moist and firm . It seemed much farther going down than it had been going up . When he finally reached the valley floor , he stood on the verge of a meadow , with silver-leafed trees , just like in his dream . So his dream had been true , showing him a real place that he could not have imagined . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did the Mound have to do with anything at all ? It was afternoon now , they 'd taken so long circling the Mound  --  Measure might already be dying , and he did n't have any idea how to go about helping him . He could n't think of anything to do but walk . He thought he 'd cross the valley and see one of the other mounds , but it was the strangest thing . No matter how far he walked , no matter how many silver-leafed trees he passed , the mound he walked toward was always just as far away . It made him afraid  --  would he be trapped up here forever ?  --  and he hurried back in the direction he started from . In just a few minutes he reached the place where his footprints came down the slope . Surely he had walked away from that spot for much longer than that . A couple more tries convinced him that the valley went on forever in every direction except the one he came from . In that direction , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mound , no matter how far he 'd walked to get where he was . Alvin looked for the gold-leafed tree with the pure white fruit , but he could n't find it , and he was n't surprised . The taste of the fruit was still in his mouth from the dream the night before . He would n't get another tastep229of it , waking or dreaming , because the second bite would make him live forever . He did n't mind much , not getting that bite . Death did n't breathe all that heavy down the neck of a boy his age . He heard water . A brook , clear cold water flowing rapidly over stones . It was impossible , of course . The valleyof Eight-Face Mound was completely enclosed . If water ran so fast here , why did n't the valley fill right up to make a lake ? Why was n't there a single stream running off the mound outside ? Where would such a stream come from , anyway ? The mound was man-made , like all the other mounds scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so old . You do n't get springs coming out of man-made hills . It made him suspicious of this water , to have it be so impossible . Come to think of it , though , quite a few impossible things had happened to him in his life , and this was far from being the most peculiar . Ta-Kumsaw said to drink if the mound offered him water , so he knelt and drank , plunging his face right into the water and sucking the water straight into his mouth . It did n't take away the taste of the fruit . If anything , it was stronger after he drank . He knelt on the bank , studying the opposite shore of the brook . The water was flowing differently there . In fact , it was lapping the shore like ocean waves , and once that thought occurred to Alvin he saw that the shape of the opposite shore was just like the map of the east coast that Armor-of-God showed him . The memory came back clear and sharp . Here where the shore bowed outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep bay was the Chase-a-pick , and here was the mouth of the Potty-Mack , which made the border between the United States and the Crown Colonies . Alvin stood and stepped across the stream . It was just grass . He did n't see no rivers or towns , no boundaries , no roads . But from the coast , he could pretty much guess where the Hio country was , and where this very mound would be . He took two steps , and all of a sudden there he saw Ta-Kumsaw and Taleswapper , setting on the ground in front of him , looking up at him as surprisedas could be.  | " You climbed up after all , " said Alvin . " Nothing of the sort , " said Taleswapper . " We 've been right here since you left . " " Why did you come back down ? " asked Ta-Kumsaw . " But I ai n't down at all , " said Alvin . " I 'm down here in the valley of the mound . " " Valley ? " asked Ta-Kumsaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Taleswapper . Then Alvin understood . Not so as to put it into words , but well enough to use it , to use what the mound had given him . He could travel across the face of the land like this , a hundred miles in a step , and see the people that he needed to see . The people that he knew . Measure . Alvin touched his forehead in salute to the two men who waited for him , then took a small step . They disappeared . He found the town of Vigor Church easy enough . First person he saw was Armor-of-God , kneeling in prayer . Alvin did n't say nothing to him , for fear Armor might take it as a vision of the dead . Where would Armor be , though ? In his own house ? In that case Vinegar Riley 's place would be back this way , east of town . He turned around . He saw his own father , setting with Mother . Pa was smoothing out some musket balls he 'd cast . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was angry , and so was Pa . " Women and children , that 's what they are in that town . Even if the Prophet and Ta-Kumsaw killed our boys , them women and children there did n't do it . You 'll be no better than them if you raise a hand against them . I wo n't see you come back into this house , I 'll never see you again if you kill one soul of them .. I swear it , Alvin Miller . " Pa just kept on polishing , except once when he said , " They killed my boys . " Alvin tried to answer , opened his mouth to say , " But I ai n't dead , Pa ! " It did n't work . He could n't say a word . He was n't brought up here to give a vision to his parents , neither . Itp231was Measure he had to find , or Pa 's own musket ball would kill the Shining Man . It was n't far , not even a step . Alvin just inched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught a glimpse of Calm and David , shooting their guns  --  probablyat targets . And Wastenot and Wantnot , ramming something  --  ramming shot down the barrel of a cannon . Glimpses of other folks , though because he did n't know or care about them he did n't see them clear . Finally he saw Measure . He had to be dead . His neck was broke , judging from the angle of his head , and his arms and legs were all broke , too . Alvin did n't dare move , or he 'd travel a mile in an instant , and Measure would disappear just like the others . Alvin just stood there , and sent his spark out into the body of his brother , lying before him on the ground . Alvin never felt such pain in all his life . It was n't Measure 's pain , it was his own . It was Alvin 's sense of how things ought to be , of the right shape of things ; inside Measure 's body , nothing was going right . Parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly and crushinghis own life out , his brain was n't connected to his body no more , it was the most terrible mess Alvin ever saw , everything wrong , so wrong that it hurt him to see it , a pain so sharp he cried out . But Measure did n't hear him . Measure was beyond hearing . If Measure was n't dead he was half an inch from being dead , and that was sure . Alvin went to his heart first . It was still pumping , but there was n't much blood left in the veins ; it was all lost in Measure 's chest and belly . That was the first thing Alvin had to mend , heal up the blood vessels and get the blood back where it belonged , flowing in its channels . Time , it all took time . All the broken ribs , the cut-up organs . All the bones , joining them without so much as a hand to help move something into the right place  --  some of the bones were so out of line that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait until Measure woke up enough to help him . So Alvin got inside Measure 's brain , the nerves run/fling down his spine , and healed it all , put it back the way it had to be . Measure woke with one long , terrible scream of agony . He was alive and the pain was back , sharper and clearer than it ever was before . I 'm sorry , Measure . I ca n't heal you up without letting the pain come back . And I got to heal you , or too many innocent folks are dead . Alvin did n't even notice that it was already night , and half his work still lay ahead of him.  |p233IN  PROPHETSTOWN , no one but the children slept that night . The adults all felt the circling White army ; the hidingsand hexes cast by the White troops were like trumpets and banners to the land-sense of the Reds . Not all of them found they had the courage to keep their oath , now that iron-and-fire death was hours away . But they kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prophetstown , passing silently betweencompanies of White soldiers , who neither heard nor saw them . Knowing they could not die without defending themselves , they left , so that not one Red would mar the perfection of the Prophet 's refusal to fight . Tenskwa-Tawa was not surprised that some left ; he was surprised that so many stayed . Almost all . So many who believed in him , so many who would prove that trust in blood . He dreaded the morning ; the pain of a single murder close at hand had cursed him with the black noise for many years . True , it was his father who was killed , so the pain was more ; but did he love the people of Prophetstown any less than he had loved his father ? Yet he had to fend off the black noise , keep his wits about him , or all their deaths would be in vain . If their dying accomplished nothing , he would n't have them do it . So many times he had searched the crystal tower , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would lead to something good . The best that he could find wasp234the land divided , Red west of the Mizzipy , White to the east . Even that , though , could be found only through the narrowest of paths . So much depended on the White boys , so much on Tenskwa-Tawa , so much on White Murderer Harrison himself . For in all the paths in which Harrison showed any mercy , the massacre of Tippy-Canoe did nothing to stop the destruction of the Reds , and , with them , the land . In all those paths , the Red men dwindled , confined to tiny preserves of desolate land , until the whole land was White , and therefore brutalized into submission , stripped and cut and ravished , giving vast amounts of food that was only an imitation of the true harvest , poisoned into life by alchemical trickery . Even the White man suffered in those visions of the future , but it would be many generations before he realized what he had done . Yet here  --  Prophetstown  --  there was a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unlikely path , but a better one . One that would lead to a living land after all , even if it was truncated ; one that would lead someday to a crystal city catching sunlight and turning it into visions of truth for all who lived within it . That was Tenskwa-Tawa 's hope , that he could cling to the bright vision through all of tomorrow 's pain , and so turn that pain , that blood , that black noise of murder , to an event that would change the world . Even before the first detectable rays of light rose above the horizon , Tenskwa-Tawa felt the coming dawn . He felt it partly in the stirring of life to the east . He could feel it from farther off than any other Red . He felt it also , though , from the movements among the Whites as they prepared to light the matches for their cannon . Four fires , hidden and therefore revealed by spells and witchery . Four cannon , poised to rake the city , end to end . Tenskwa-Tawa walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and awakened their children . The White men thought to kill them in their sleep , faceless within their wigwams and lodges . Instead , they emerged in the darkness , walking surefooted to the broad meadow of the meeting ground . There was n't room enough for all of them even to sit . They stood , families together , fatherp235and mother with their children in the circle of their embrace , waiting for the White man to spill their blood . " The earth will not soak up your blood , " TenskwaTawahad promised them . " It will flow into the river , and I will hold it there , all the power of all your lives and all your deaths , and I will use it to keep the land alive , and bind the White man to the lands he has already captured and begun to kill . " , So now Tenskwa-Tawa made his way to the bank of the Tippy-Canoe , watching the meadow fill up with his people , of whom so many would die before him because they believed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller , " said General Harrison . " It 's your kin whose blood we 'll avenge today . I want you to have the honor of firing the first bullet in this war . " Mike Fink watched as the hot-eyed miller carefully rammed wad and shot down his musket barrel . Mike knew the thirst for murder in his eyes . It was a kind of madness that came on a man , and it made him dangerous , made him able to do things beyond his normal reach . Mike was just as glad that miller did n't know just when and how his boy had died . Oh , Governor Bill had n't never told him right out who that young man was , but Mike Fink was n't a boy in short pants , and he knew all right . Harrison played a deep game , but one thing was sure . He 'd do anything to raise himself higher and put more land and people under his control . And Mike Fink knew that Harrison would only keep him around as long as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mike Fink did n't think of himself as a murderer . He thought of life as a contest , and dying was what happened to those who came out second best , but it was n't the same as murder , it was a fair fight . Like how he killed Hooch  --  Hooch did n't have to be so careless . Hooch could have noticed Mike was n't on the shore with the other poleboys , Hooch could have been watchful and wary , and if he had been , why , Mike Fink might well have died . So Hooch lost his life becausep236he lost the contest  --  the contest he and Mike were both playing for . But that boy yesterday , he was n't a player . He was n't in the contest at all . He just wanted to go home . Mike Fink never wrassled a man who did n't want a fight , and he never killed a man who was n't set to kill him first if he got a chance . Yesterday was the first time he had ever killed somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it , did n't like it one bit . Mike could see now that Governor Bill thought he had killed Hooch that same way , just because he was told to . But it was n't so . And today Mike Fink looked at the young man 's father , with all that rage in his eyes , and he said to that man  --  but silently , so nobody could hear  --  he said , I 'm with you , I agree with you that the man who killed your boy should die . Trouble was , Mike Fink was that man . And he was plain ashamed . Same thing with them Red men in Prophetstown . What kind of contest was it , to wake them up with grapeshotwhistling through their own houses , setting them afire , cutting into their bodies , the bodies of children and women and old men ? Not my kind of fight , thought Mike Fink . The first light of dawn came into the sky . Prophetstown was still nothing but shadows , but it was time . Alvin Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then he fired . A few seconds later , the cannons banged out their answer . Maybe a few more seconds , and the first flame appeared in the town . The cannons fired again . Yet not a soul ran screaming out of the wigwams . Not even the ones that were afire . Did n't anybody else notice it ? Did n't they realize that the Reds were all gone out of Prophetstown ? And if they were gone , that meant they knew all about this morning 's attack . And if they knew , that meant they might be ready , lying in ambush . Or maybe they all escaped , or maybeMike Fink 's lucky amulet was nearly burning him , it felt so hot . He knew what that meant . Time to go . Somethingreal bad was going to happen to him if he stayed . So he slid off down the line of soldiers  --  or whatp237passed for soldiers , since there had n't been more than a day or two for training some of these raw farmers . Nobody paid no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wigwams burn . Some of them had finally noticed that nobody seemed to be in the Red city , and they were talking about it , worried . Mike said nothing , kept moving along the line , down toward the creek . The cannon were all on the high ground ; they sounded farther away . Mike emerged from the trees into the cleared ground that ran down to the river . There he stopped short and stared . The dawn was still just a grey streak in the distance , but there was no mistaking what he saw . Thousandsand thousands of Reds , standing shoulder to shoulderin the meadow . Some were crying softly  --  no doubt stray shrapnel and musket balls had come this far , since two of the cannons were on the opposite side of the city from here , firing this direction . But they were n't making a move to defend themselves . It was n't an ambush . They had no weapons . These Red folks were all lined up to die . There was maybe a dozen canoes up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the water and rolled himself aboard . Downstream , that 's where he 'd go , all the way down the Wobbish to the Hio . It was n't war today , it was massacre , and that just was n't Mike Fink 's kind of fight . Nearly everybody 's got a thing so bad he just wo n't do it . In the darkness of the root cellar , Measure could n't see if Alvin was really there or not . But he could hear his voice , soft but urgent , riding in over the crest of the pain . " I 'm trying to fix you , Measure , but I need your help . " Measure could n't answer . Speech was n't one of the things he could manage right at the moment . " I 've fixed your neck , and some of your ribs , and the guts that got tore up , " said Alvin . " And your left arm bones were pretty much in a line , so they 're all right , can you feel that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from Measure 's left arm . He moved it . It jostled the whole rest of his body , but it could move , it had some strength in it.  | " Your ribs , " said Alvin . " Poking out . You got to push them back in place . " Measure pushed on one and nearly fainted from the pain . " I ca n't . " " You got to . " " Make it not hurt . " " Measure , I do n't know how . Not without making it so you ca n't move . You just got to stand it . Everything you get back in place , I can fix it , and then it wo n't hurt no more , but first you got to straighten it , you got to . " " You do it . " " I ca n't . " " Just reach out and do it , Alvin , you 're big for ten , you can do it . " " I ca n't . " " I once cut your bone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Measure , I ca n't do it cause I ai n't there . " This made no sense to Measure . So he knew he wasdreaming . Well , if he was dreaming , why did n't he comeup with some dream where things did n't hurt so bad ? " Push on the bone , Measure . " Alvin just would n't go away . So Measure pushed , and it hurt him . But Alvin was as good as his word . Soon after , the place where he straightened out the bone did n't hurt no more . It took so long . He was so tore up that it seemed there just was n't no end to the pain . But in between times , while Alvin was making things heal up where he just fixed the bones , Measure explained to Alvin what had happened to him , and Alvin told him what he knew , and pretty soon Measure understood that there was a lot more to this than saving the life of one young man in a root cellar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly believe it . He had hurt so much for so many hours that it felt downright strange not to hurt anywhere . He heard the thump , thump of cannon firing . " Can you hear that , Alvin ? " he asked . Alvin could n't . " The shooting 's started . The cannon . " " Then run , Measure . Go as fast as you can . "  | " Alvin , I 'm in a root cellar . They barred the door . " Alvin cussed with a couple of words that Measure did n't know the boy had ever heard . " Alvin , I got me a hole half-dug here in the back . You got such a knack with stone , I wondered if you could loosen things up for me here , so I could dig out real fast . " And that 's how it worked out . Measure rolled himself into the hole and just closed his eyes and pawed at the dirt above his head . It was nothing like digging the day before , rubbing his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid off him ; when he reached up to dig more , the dirt slipped under his shoulders , and there it firmed right up , so that he did n't even have to think about moving the dirt out of the hole , it was just filling up underneath him . He kicked , and his legs jostled the dirt loose , so his whole body was rising up the same way . Swimming through dirt , that 's what I 'm doing , he thought , and he started to laugh , it was so easy and so strange . His laugh was finished in the open air . He was on top , just behind the root cellar . The sky was pretty light  --  the sun would be up in just a minute or so . The booming of the cannon had stopped . Did that mean it was over , too late ? Maybe , though , they were just letting the guns cool . Or moving them to another place . Or maybe the Reds even managed to capture the gunsBut would that be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father were with them guns , and if the Reds won this battle , some of his kin might die . It was one thing to know that the Reds were in the right and the Whites in the wrong ; it was something else to wish defeat on your own family , defeat and maybe death . He had to stop the battle , and so he ran , like he never done before . Alvin 's voice was gone , now , but Measure did n't need to be encouraged . He fair to flew down that road . He met two people on the way . One was Mrs. Hatch , who was driving her wagon along the road , loaded down with supplies . When she saw Measure , she screamed  --  he was wearing a loincloth and filthy as could be , and she could n't be blamed for thinking he was a Red all set to scalp her . She was off that wagon and running beforep240Measure could so much as call her name . Well , that was fine with him . He nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , and then he was riding bareback , galloping along the road hoping that the horse would n't trip and spill him . The other person he met along the way was Armor-ofGod . Armor was kneeling in the middle of the common green , out front of his store , praying his heart out while the cannon roared and the muskets crackled across the river . Measure hailed him , and Armor looked up with a face like as if he 'd seen Jesus resurrected . " Measure ! " he shouted . " Stop , stop ! " Measure was all set to go on , to say he had no time , but then Armor was out in the middle of the way , and the horse was shy to go around him , so he did stop . " Measure , are you an angel or alive ? " " Alive , no thanks to Harrison . Tried to murder me , he did . I 'm alive and so is Alvin . This whole thing was Harrison 's doing , and I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't go like that , " said Armor . " Wait , I said ! You ca n't just show up wearing a loincloth and coveredup with dirt like that , somebody 's going to think you 're a Red and shoot you on the spot ! " " Then hop on this horse behind me , and give me your clothing on the way ! " So Measure hoisted Armor-of-God onto the horse behind him , and they rode out to the river crossing . Peter Ferryman 's wife was there to run the winch . One look at Measure was enough to tell her all she needed to know . " Hurry , " she said . " It 's so bad , the river 's runningscarlet . " On the ferry , Armor stripped off his clothes while Measure ducked himself in the water , blood and all , to wash some of the dirt away . He did n't come out clean , but at least he looked somewhat like a White man . Still wet , he put on Armor 's shirt and trousers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Armor being a smaller man , but Measure shrugged on the coat all the same . While he did , he said , " Sorry to leave you with just your summerjohns . " " I 'd stand naked half the day in front of all the ladiesp241in church if it would stop this massacre , " said Armor . If he said more , Measure did n't hear it , cause he was already on his way . Nothing was the way Alvin Miller Senior , thought that it would be . He 'd imagined shooting his musket at the same screaming savages who cut up and killed his boys . But the city turned up empty , and they found the Reds all gathered in Speaking Meadow , just like they was ready for a sermonfrom the Prophet . Miller never knowed there was so many Reds in Prophetstown , cause he never seen them all in the same place like this . But they were Reds , were n't they ? So he shot his musket all the same , just like the other men , firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . How could he miss , them all standingtogether so close ? The bloodlust was on him then , he was crazy with anger and the power to kill . He did n't noticehow some of the other men were getting quieter . Shooting less often . He just loaded and fired , loaded and fired , stepping a yard or two closer every time , out from the cover of the forest , out into the open ; only when the cannon got moved into place did he stop shooting , make way for them , watched them mow great swaths through the mass of Reds . That was the first time he really noticed what all was happening to the Reds , what they were doing , what they were n't doing . They were n't screaming . They were n't fighting back . They were just standing there , men and women and children , just looking out at the White men who were killing them . Not a one even turned his back to the hail of shrapnel . Not a parent tried to shield a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , died . The grapeshot carved gaps in the crowd ; the only thing to stop the spray of metal was human bodies . Miller saw them fall . Them as could , got up again , or at least knelt , or raised their heads above the mass of corpses so that the next blast would take them and kill them . What is it , do they want to die ? Miller looked around him . He and the men with him were standing in a sea of corpses  --  they had already walked out to where the outer edges of the crowd of Redsp242had been . Right at his feet , the body of a boy no older than Alvin lay curled , his eye blown out by a musket ball . Maybe my own musket ball , thought Miller . Maybe I killed this boy . During the lulls between cannon volleys , Miller could hear men crying . Not the Reds , the ones still living , huddled in an ever-smaller mass down toward the river . No , the men crying were his neighbors , White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them were talking , pleading . Stop it , they said . Please , stop it . Please stop . Were they talking to the cannon ? Or to the Red men and women , who insisted on standing there , not trying to escape , not crying out in fear ? Or to their children , who faced the guns as bravely as their parents ? Or did they speak to the terrible gnawing pain in their own hearts , to see what they had done , were doing , would yet do ? Miller noticed that the blood did n't soak into the grass of the meadow . As it poured out of the wounds of those most recently hit , it formed rivulets , streams , great sheets of blood flowing down the slope of the meadow , toward the Tippy-Canoe Creek . The morning sunlight on this bright clear day shone vivid red from the water of the creek . While he was watching , all at once the water of the creek went smooth as glass . The sunlight did n't dance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding him . But he could still see a solitary Red man walking on the water , just like Jesus in the story , standing on the water in the middle of the creek . It was n't just a whimper behind him anymore . It was a shout , from more and more men . Stop shooting ! Stop it ! Put down your guns ! And then others , talking about the man standing on the water . A bugle sounded . The men fell silent . " Time to finish them , men ! " shouted Harrison . He was on a prancing stallionat the head of the meadow , leading the way down the blood-slick hill . None of the farmer folk were with him , but his uniformed soldiers formed a line and came along , bayonets fixed . Where once ten thousand Reds had stood , there was just a field of bodies , and maybe a thousand , ap243ragged remnant , gathered near the water at the bottom of the hill . That was the moment when a tall young White man ran from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a suit too small , his feet bare , his coat and waistcoat all unbuttoned , his hair wet and tousled , and face grimy and wet . But Miller knew him , knew him before he heard his voice . " Measure ! " he cried . " It 's my boy Measure ! " He threw down his musket and ran out into the field of corpses , down the hill toward his son . " My boy Measure ! He 's alive ! You 're alive ! " Then he slipped in the blood , or maybe he tripped on a body , but whatever happened he fell , his hands splashing into a river of blood , spattering his chest and face . He heard Measure 's voice , not ten yards away , shoutingout so every man could hear him . " The Reds who captured me were hired by Harrison . Ta-Kumsaw and Tenskwa-Tawa saved me . When I came home two days ago , Harrison 's soldiers captured me and would n't let me tell you the truth . He even tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so every word carried , every sound was understood . " He knew all the time . This whole thing , Harrison planned it all along . The Reds are innocent . You 're killing innocent people . " Miller stood up from the bloody field and raised his hands high over his head , thick blood running from his scarlet hands . A cry was wrung from his throat , forced out by anguish , by despair . " What have I done ! What have I done ! " The cry was echoed by a dozen , a hundred , three hundred voices . And there was General Harrison on his prancing horse , out in front of everybody . Even his own soldiers had thrown down their guns by now . " It 's a lie ! " cried Harrison . " I never saw this boy ! Someone has played a terrible trick on me ! " " It ai n't no trick ! " shouted Measure . " Here 's his kerchief  --  they stuffed it in my mouth yesterday , to gag me while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly in his son 's hand . It had the WHH embroidered in large , clear letters in
