Many tips but few clues in the hunt for a kidnaped American <P> At least 1,200 carabinieri established roadblocks in the region around Verona . Hundreds of others fanned out through the Northern Italian cities of Padua , Bolzano and Mestre , looking for clues and searching abandoned houses . Meanwhile , six antiterrorist experts from the U.S. Defense Department rushed to the scene . Yet by week 's end the biggest manhunt since the 1978 assassination of former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro had come up empty . There was still no hint of the whereabouts of Brigadier General James Dozier , 50 , the U.S. Army officer held by Italy 's terrorist Red Brigades . <P> Nor had the terrorists made it clear what they hoped to gain by kidnaping the highest-ranking American official at the Verona headquarters of NATO 'S Southern Europe land forces . In the past , the Red Brigades ' targets have always been Italians . The only apparently authentic message from the terrorist group was a note labeled " Communique No. 1 , " found in a downtown Rome trash can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The message made no ransom demands but merely stated that on Dec. 17 an " armed nucleus " of Red Brigades " had captured and placed in a people 's prison the Yankee pig of the American occupying forces . " The six-page typed text also solicited international support for West Germany 's terrorist Red Army Faction , the Irish Republican Army and Spain 's violently separatist Basque ETA . <P> At midweek Italian police arrested Pasqua Aurora Belli , 34 , a former schoolteacher , and Flavio Amico , 26 , a printer , as suspects in the Dozier kidnaping , but their exact role in the crime was not clear . Meanwhile , police were kept busy with a number of spurious tips , including a telephone message to the Beirut office of the Italian news agency ANSA . The caller , speaking in Arabic , claimed that Dozier had been executed and that his body could be found in a small but unnamed Italian village . Police found nothing , and the message was considered to be a hoax . <P> U.S. and Italian officials last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , NATO headquarters in Brussels issued a statement saying that the Red Brigades had made a serious error if they expected to extract military secrets from Dozier . The general was described as being a specialist only in logistics and support activity , not in defense plans for the alliance . <P> That is surely not why Dozier was abducted . One theory is that the Red Brigades , having failed to throw Italy into chaos with the assassination of Moro and other prominent Italians , were desperate to regain their credibility . " The society did not collapse , " says Bertram Brown , a terrorism consultant for California 's Rand Corp . " Thus they had to leap the firebreak to internationalism by kidnaping an American . " Adds Franco Ferracuti , a Rome University professor of criminology : " The Red Brigades want to embarrass the U.S. , to undermine NATO and , not incidentally , to reestablish themselves as a force to be reckoned with .
