Lee Iacocca can understand why Wisconsin is called the Badger State . Its citizens and Governor Tommy Thompson have been in an uproar since Chrysler decided in January to shut down an 86-year-old assembly plant in Kenosha , which would put 5,500 employees out of work . Last week Iacocca offered a peace plan : a $20 million education-and-housing fund for the workers , to be financed by profits from new Chrysler vehicles sold in Wisconsin this year . Meeting with Thompson in Washington , Iacocca said he would consider keeping the plant open a few weeks or months longer than its planned Sept. 30 closing . <P> All that may fail to appease the Badgers . Wisconsin 's attorney general is preparing a lawsuit against Chrysler claiming the company reneged on a 1987 promise to keep the plant open for five years in return for $5 million in job training from the state .
