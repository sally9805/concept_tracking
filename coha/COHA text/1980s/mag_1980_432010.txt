 |p532  THE JET AIRPLANE flew south from Yugoslavia out over the cobalt Adriatic , turned 90 degrees , and headed landward ? toward Albania . In antiquity , Rome 's legions , coming down the Appian Way to Brindisi on the heel of Italy and crossing the Strait of Otranto , landed here and marched east on the great military highway to Thessalonica and Constantinople . Goths and Normans invaded . The Byzantine , Bulgarian , Serbian , and Venetian empires held sway . Next the Ottoman Turks ruled for nearly five centuries and made Albania the only predominantly Muslim country in Europe . Then came the armies of Mussolini and Hitler . Today no international highway crosses Albania . Her 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) of railroad pass no frontier . No foreign plane is permitted to fly across her airspace . Commercial flights , such as our half-empty , biweekly flight from Belgrade , must come from seaward and in daylight hours only . I looked around the cabin at the score of fellow passengers ? an elderly woman , a diplomat , an Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other European tongues ) , and businessmen coming to buy minerals or to sell machinery . Where did I fit the prescription for visitors set by Albania 's dictator , Communist Party chief Enver Hoxha ? He had declared his country " closed to enemies , spies , hippies , and hooligans , but open to friends ( Marxist @#  |p533  or non-Marxist ) , to revolutionaries and progressive democrats , to honest tourists .. . who do not interfere in our affairs . " More apt was a travel agent 's comment : Only madmen , diplomats , and journalists go to Albania . " I was a Turkish journalist and had waited nearly a year to get my visa request approved . We came in over the beach and coastal plain near Durres and saw , beyond terraced hillsides , a jagged line of misty peaks riding across the horizon like a gigantic electrocardiogram . I wondered what I would find in this tiny nation of 2.7 million people , the size of Maryland with fewer people , and as little known as Tibet . For millennia descendants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traditionally known as Illyrians , have hung on in this most rugged land in the Balkans ? " mountains " in Turkish . Amid peaks rising to 2,764 meters ( 9,068 feet ) , they followed an implacable clan code of honor that wiped out entire families through blood feuds lasting generations . Today this Land of the Eagle is totally collectivized . Last stronghold of Stalinism , it is Europe 's most dogmatic Communist country , locked in the grip of a leader who has impelled the Continent 's most backward nation out of the ashes of World War II in a drive to modernization , from stick plow to tractor , from handicraft and rushlight to factory and dynamo . Here I would find an unusual social experiment : an entire generation growing up sealed off in a hard-line socialist laboratory , challenging the world , self-isolated , uncontaminated by East or West . Unconsciously I stroked my goatee ? and was startled by the sudden realization that I might lose it ! Albania forbids entry to men with long hair or full beards , and to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bourgeois decadence . Tales abound of hapless visitors being packed off to the airport barber to be shorn . But the soldier who met me at the airplane door was more intent on my passport than my goatee , and I descended in the noon sun of a September day into one of Europe 's smallest and sleepiest airports , shaded by palms and orange trees heavy with fruit . Kopi Kycyku greeted me in Turkish . A member of the Foreign Ministry 's hospitality committee ,  |p543  he would bring to my guide-interpreter each morning the day 's plan . Now he brought me espresso , expedited formalities , and ushered me into a Polish-made Fiat for the half hour 's ride to Tirana , the capital . Along the way brigades of peasants looked up from their labor in the fields . But we met little traffic on the road . Life in Tirana centers around Skanderbeg Square , with its monument to the 15thcentury hero who fought against the Ottoman Empire . The modern Palace of Culture faces it , as do several royal buildings of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of those now houses offices of the satirical magazine Hosteni ; another , the old Parliament building , is a children 's theater . For a kilometer from Skanderbeg Square to University Square stretches the Boulevard of Fallen Heroes , flanked by huge statues of Lenin and Stalin , the Communist Party headquarters , major ministries , and the soccer stadium . In the early afternoon the square looked deserted : an official car , a military vehicle , a bus , several bicycles , a scattering of old women sweeping the street . Yet in the center of the square stood a policeman solemnly directing traffic . Albania allows no private cars , and its capital has only a score of cabs , all state owned . Most were lined up near the square . Albanians seldom use them . We pulled up in front of the Hotel Dajti , built by the Italians in the early 1940s when the avenue was called Viale Savoia . It is one of Tirana 's two hotels for foreigners , and locals may not lodge in it . My balconied room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift shop , such a carpet sold for $20 a square meter in foreign currency . I checked the TV room ? only local programs could be received . I studied press releases spread on a table in the big hall and paused before a display of journals : the magazine New Albania ;  |p544  Zeri i Popullit ( Voice of the People ) , the party newspaper ; and a sampling of Albania 's dailies , all similar in content . Paperback editions of Enver Hoxha 's books were available in several languages ? but not one foreign newspaper , magazine , or book . It was as if the outside world did not exist . Emerging from the hotel at dusk , I returned to Skanderbeg Square . What a change ! It seemed that half of Tirana 's 200,000 people had gathered here after work . Some strolled the parklike walks along Stalin Boulevard , others conversed in small groups or clustered around kiosks to buy Albanian cigarettes , soft drinks , and papers . Young men and women flirted . Parents streamed to the Palace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while students crowded its national library . And amid the square 's chaos of buses , bicycles , and pedestrians , the policeman shrilly shepherded traffic with his whistle . For about two hours the heart of Tirana throbbed with life , then fell silent again . Even the traffic officer had gone home . Nation Spurns " Revisionist " Giants The following morning Bashkim Babani , my guide-interpreter , a thin man in his mid30s , took me through the Palace of Culture . Albanians are proud of this building , started by the Russians and left unfinished when they pulled out of Albania in 1961 as a result of an ideological split . Said my guide : " The Soviet revisionists and imperialists cut all aid to us and imposed an economic blockade , thinking we would soon perish . But we mobilized our forces and completed this building . It stands today as a symbol of our triumph . " Breaking with " Khrushchev 's group of renegades , " Hoxha turned to the Soviet Union 's bitter foe , China 's Mao Zedong . Albania became China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and received between one and two billion dollars of economic and military aid . That lasted until 1978 , when China 's growing rapprochement with the " imperialist " United States and " revisionist " Yugoslavia broke the " eternal friendship . " Claiming to perceive behind the " hypocritical smiles " of Mao 's successors " the perfidy . . . of one who stabs you in the night and mourns you 544 @# by day , " Albania now remained the only citadel of " true Marxism-Leninism . " Where would Albania turn this time ? From Tirana to the smallest village , in the streets , on buildings , in factories , schools , and farms , slogans proclaim the answer . A banner in Skanderbeg Square reads : " Without any foreign aid and any credit from abroad , we rely entirely on our own forces . " On the old city hall : " We shall break the blockade and encirclement of imperialism and revisionism . " Atop the Prime Minister 's office : " Long live our people 's power . " A foreign-language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Let us build socialism with a pick in one hand and a rifle in the other . " Hurling defiance to the world ? seeing themselves opposed by giant China and menaced by the U.S.S.R. and its Easternbloc satellites ; fearful and suspicious of neighboring Yugoslavia and Greece and the West ? lilliputian Albania will go it alone . How can she do it ? By mobilizing production . Plants often work three shifts to use machinery 24 hours a day . I saw tractors work fields by headlight , then go by truck at night to another farm complex for the morning plowing . As part of this " technical revolution , " some engineers , technicians , and workers add several hours to their daily eight , lengthening their 48-hour , six-day workweek . " Do you get extra pay for overtime ? " The question was put to a worker in a Tirana factory making spare truck and tractor parts . " No , we do n't ask for it . We volunteer because we believe this work is the way to break the blockade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Toma retired at 60 three years ago . But now he is back at the same factory . " We are united in this goal , to contribute to making our economy self-dependent . I am still strong . I can not sit idle while the whole nation struggles . " Did he receive pay ? " I 'm already getting my pension . " Civil servants , students , even party officials and diplomats put in at least one month 's labor a year in factory or on farm . Workers ' brigades compete in topping production quotas . This brings rewards in medals , citations , and extra days of vacation @#  |p545  at a resort . Bulletin boards are full of " grumble sheets , " intended to improve morale and production through " self-criticism . " At the Enver Hoxha factory in Tirana , my colleague Sami Kohen was proudly shown the first Albanian-made tractor . When the Chinese cut off aid , they left this ctory , a hydroelectric dam , mines , and ther major projects unfinished . " The Chinese technicians even took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then they tried to sabotage the factory by refusing to deliver needed machinery . But we completed the plant and got the machines and parts from other countries . Not as foreign aid or on credit . We had enough of such help from the Russians and Chinese . If we need something , we buy it from any country ? in cash . Or we trade for it . That way we maintain our independence . " In fact , the Albanian constitution of 1976 forbids credit deals , prohibiting bank loans from East or West . Living Well , Albanian Style Few other countries could have chosen this hard way to development . But Albania is ruled by an iron hand . And Albanians are used to privation . Hardship of earthquake and flood followed the horrors of war . When the Russians pulled out , severe drought raised the specter of starvation ; many commodities were restricted . Today , though Albania is far from prosperous , she has no serious shortages and no rationing . People are plainly dressed , but none are in rags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Western standards . But compared with yesterday 's misery , Albanians do n't doubt that they do better today . And they take pride in their will to survive on their own terms : " We prefer to feed on grass if need be . We will never stretch our hand to the imperialists . " " We experienced difficult days , " 71-yearold Kristo Teodori told Sami Kohen , on a visit to a cooperative at Finiq in southern Albania . " I spent my youth in misery , right on this plain . I worked hard for the landowner , yet could scarcely make a living . Today , thanks to Enver Hoxha , we live well . " The old man shares a three-room house with his son , Jorgo , 47 , his daughter-in-law , and her sister . Over Turkish coffee and cognac , he said the cooperative today comprises 17 villages with 8,000 inhabitants and 3,400 hectares of land , producing wheat , corn , rice , cotton , vegetables , fruit , pigs , and cows . Before the " liberation " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ; houses , tools , and seeds all belong to the cooperative , and each farmer gets a share of the output . The sale of any surplus helps maintain a health center , schools , shops , a theater , and sport facilities . The family 's three working members earn enough for essentials , so Kristo Teodori can spend part of his monthly pension of 420 leks ( $85 ) on cigarettes and cognac . " I call it Enver Hoxha 's bonus . ' " Hoxha 's regime launched its agrarian reform in 1945 , taking land from owners and distributing it to peasants . Collectivization was completed in the 1960s . The results : drained and flood-controlled river valleys , irrigated farms , and hillside terraces . Mountainous Albania 's arable land , once a scant 10 percent , has been doubled , malaria wiped out , health and social services vastly improved . Four decades ago Albanians could expect to live 38 years . Today they can look forward to 68 . In its challenge to the world , Albania also can rely on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union , Albania stands third in production of chrome . Limited in needs , it is self-sufficient in energy ? oil , some coal , abundant hydroelectric power from its dammed rivers . I saw power lines marching to all parts of the country . Mountain hamlets have been electrified , and Albania even sells surplus electricity to neighboring Yugoslavia and Greece . Industrial , mineral , and agricultural products fill the " Albania Today " exhibition in Tirana . " Everything here is the product of our labor and sacrifice , " said Hysen Vaqarri , the exhibition director . " We even produce enough food for export . Nor does the world energy crisis affect us . We manufacture everything from radios to kitchenware . We do all this with our own forces ? without foreign support . " So intent are they on self-reliance that Albanians eschewed aid from the International Red Cross when an earthquake devastated the Shkoder region in northern Albania in April 1979.  |p546  Throughout Albania I watched students , both male and female , building roads , putting up houses , tilling farmland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending northward primarily through student labor ( pages 538-9 ) . " This physical labor lets us students get to know our country and people better , increase our practical knowledge , share our theoretical education , and lets us help build socialism . " 546 So said Gjergj Murra , Bashkim cami , and Zelliha Kraga , history students at the State University in Tirana . Besides six class hours daily , they take one full day of military training a week . " What do you do after class ? " " Study the day 's lessons . " " And in your free time ? " " We stroll . . . go to the theater or movies ... listen to classical music . " Courses last eight months . Then , besides the month of physical labor for students , there is a month of military service , girls as well as boys . All high-school graduates must serve a year in a factory or on a farm before they can get a job or enter university . " And after graduation ? " " A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine serves in a hospital . An engineer in a factory . Philosophy or language majors usually teach . " University administrators said that 80 percent of the population was illiterate in 1938 ; today 80 percent can read and write . The university began in 195 7 with 3,600 students . Enrollment today is 16,000 , - in seven faculties : engineering , political science . geology , history , economics , medicine , and natural sciences . But no school of law . Why not ? " Our system has no need for lawyers . " came the answer . " Our citizens require no third person to defend them . The judges of the People 's Courts , elected by the people . take their rights into consideration . " Ominously , the Ministry of Justice disappeared in one of Enver Hoxha 's many administrative reforms . Marxism-Leninism is the core subject in all the faculties , leading to the student 's " ideological formation . " Essential courses include the history of the Albanian Party of Labor , economic policies of capitalism and socialism , dialectical materialism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works of Enver Hoxha . The five-year plan determines university admissions , with quotas by region and family occupation ? one-third each for workers , farmers , and intellectuals . Those whose families were landlords or tradesmen under the previous system have a harder time . " What if students fail their exams ? " " Our youth is idealistic . At the end of the  |p551  year 96 percent pass . Those who fail are transferred to a farm or factory . Remember , our five-year plan designates how many doctors , engineers , geologists , scientists , and teachers the country needs each year . This university may not produce fewer . We must have the best young people to attain our goals in accordance with the plan . " Working for the State " The plan . " The phrase seemed to evoke awe whenever used . Indeed , in so dogmatically centralized an economy as Albania 's the plan is sacred . The plan is based on complete state ownership . Every shop , restaurant , and kiosk belongs to the state . Every taxi driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the state . Farmers work either on state-run farms or on state-sanctioned cooperatives . Coming from inflation-plagued Turkey , I found an undeniable appeal in certain aspects of Albania 's economy . No income tax . No inflation . No dependence on outside energy sources . And since everything is tightly @# controlled by the state , no price hikes ? or wage increases . Factory workers and farmers usually get 600 to 700 leks a month ( a dollar is worth five leks ) ; a university professor about 1,000 . Wage leveling imposes a ceiling of 1,200 leks , except for top officials . By Western standards , salaries are low . But so are many prices . In the shops I found meat from 12 to 18 leks a kilo ( $1.10 to $1.60 a pound ) , bread 2 leks ( 18 ? a pound ) ; a pack of local cigarettes costs 2 leks ( 400 ) . Clothing strains the family budget . I looked at Albanian-made men 's suits costing a month 's salary , and which I would n't want to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the quality is poor . The plan limits Albania 's 250 million dollars of imports largely to essential machinery , spare parts , and raw materials , balanced by exports . Albania keeps rents low ? usually not more than 5 percent of family income . But officials admit to a shortage of flats , particularly for newly married couples . Health services and education are free , and Albanians spend little on transportation or amusements . Even Tirana offers little entertainment : afew theaters , presenting ideological films , plays , operas , and folklore programs , but no nightclubs , which smack of bourgeois decadence . Tirana has more restaurants than other towns , but few can afford to dine out often . Albanians have their own strong grape spirit , saki , as well as brandy , wine , and beer . But they are not heavy drinkers . In Tirana a boy might take his girl friend to a park , weather permitting , or to see a film on the favorite theme , the antifascist National Liberation War . Sami Kohen saw one factory-organized dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedately to old fox-trots and tangos played by an amateur orchestra . Discipline and calm prevailed . In fact , Albania 's " cultural revolution " sets the tone for youthful behavior and appearance . Not only long hair and miniskirts , but also blue jeans , narrow trousers , and makeup are taboo . No drugs , premarital sex , off-color jokes , or chewing gum . Rock music and loud jazz are frowned on . Foreign visitors usually spend the evenings in the Hotel Dajti bar , taverna , and @#  |p552  restaurant , where the cuisine is relatively good . " Apart from embassy cocktail parties , there is hardly any other place to go , anything to do , or anybody to talk to , " groused a young Western diplomat , whose previous post was Paris . I turned this into an opportunity to learn more about the roots of Albania 's suspicions about the outside world . " If I were an Albanian , I 'd be suspicious too , " my informant began . " Time and again predatory neighbors have invaded : Serbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . Remember , a million and a half Albanians live in Yugoslavia today , half as many as in Albania itself . For 70 552 years Greece claimed northern Epirus , which is southern Albania . While Western diplomats twiddled their thumbs , Mussolini marched in and took over the whole country in 1939 . Later , Tito wanted to make Albania into a seventh Yugoslav republic . A history like this leaves deep scars . " Albania today has no diplomatic relations with the United States , Britain , or West Germany . Would this policy change now that Albania has fallen out with the Soviet Union and China ? " The United States is an arch-imperialist superpower , as threatening to us as social imperialist Russia and revisionist China , " a senior official of the Albanian Foreign Ministry told Sami Kohen . " The Americans made approaches to us after the break with China , but we do not want to have anything to do with them . " " Britain still holds 40 million dollars ' worth of Albanian gold seized after World War II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us damages for the Nazi occupation , assessed at 4.5 billion dollars . We shall never accept diplomatic relations with either country without payment . " Future Holds More of the Same Today 's Albania is shaped in the image of Enver Hoxha , now past 70 . What after him ? With the editor of Hosteni , the humor magazine , I recalled the Soviet Union 's changes after Stalin and China 's after Mao . Was there any possibility Albania might also soften after Enver Hoxha ? " You compare us with those revisionist countries ? " he retorted , not amused . " No. nothing will change after Comrade Enver passes away . The party and the nation are strongly united . His teachings give us our direction . We shall not deviate from it . " Rather than opening to the outside world . the self-isolated Albanians keep constantly on a war footing . Besides two years ' military service for young men and women , all ablebodied citizens , whatever their profession . must serve a month or more every year in the armed forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices prepare the people against attack . Everywhere I traveled ? on the seacoast , in mountain passes , in fields , in city parks . amid blocks of flats ? I saw civil-defense @# @#  |p553  bunkers . They look like ? and grow like ? mushrooms , their popular name . " More steel and concrete goes for bunkers than for housing , " a diplomat told me . I knew that Enver Hoxha was concerned about the future of Yugoslavia after Tito ? and the nightmare of a Soviet occupation . Does Albania really feel threatened ? " We must be prepared for the worst , " an Albanian journalist told me . " But could tiny Albania hold out against the attack of a major power ? " Albania 's weaponry , mostly Chinese made , is outmoded , and diplomatic observers in Tirana say the country may be looking for arms in Europe . " Even if the enemy is numerically superior , we can stop them . The whole nation will mobilize instantly . Our mountains and rivers make Albania a natural fortress . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stone houses in Gjirokaster and other mountain towns , windowless walls below and loopholes above ? each house a fortress , the heritage of centuries of blood feuds . And I recalled the 15th-century citadel at Kruje ? the stronghold from which Skanderbeg conducted 25 years of guerrilla warfare against the Ottomans . Born Gjergj Kastrioti , and sent as a youthful hostage to the sultan 's court , he had risen to high command in the Ottoman Empire . Renamed for Alexander the Great Iskander Bey in Turkish ) , whom the Turks admired , Skanderbeg defected and led 300 Albanian knights to reclaim his inheritance . He renounced Islam and stemmed the Turkish tide in Europe until his death in 1468 . He lived on as a symbol of resistance . And it was under Skanderbeg 's banner ? the black double-headed eagle on a blood red field ? that Enver Hoxha 's partisans forged the independent Albania of today . State Forbids " Opium of the People " Rain grayed Lake Scutari and shrouded the wild North Albanian Alps that sentinel the border with the Yugoslav @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is navigable all the way to the Adriatic , spreads Shkoder , the ancient capital of Elyria . Brooding over it , a medieval citadel recalls Venetian masters . A monument in a park there honors five Albanian partisans who sacrificed themselves holding off 300 Nazi invaders . Near it I was taken to visit Shkoder 's Atheism Museum . Under Marx 's slogan , " Feja eshte opium per popullin ? Religion is the opium of the people , " the director , a cold , harsh-voiced man in gray , told me that religion had obstructed Albanian independence . Because the Turks identified nationality with religion , Albanians of Muslim faith ( some 70 percent of the population ) were considered Turks . The Orthodox Christians ( about 20 percent ) were called Greeks , and the Roman Catholics ( about 10 percent ) @#  |p554  Latins . Services were thus conducted , not in Albanian , which was forbidden and did n't even get its Roman alphabet until 1908 , but in three foreign languages : Arabic , Greek , and Latin . " During the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while showing me exhibits on clerical abuses , " the churches served as a fifth column for fascism , imperialism , and counterrevolution . " Hoxha 's regime executed the clergy , sentenced them to labor camps , or assigned them to " productive work . " Other Communist countries curb religion ; Albania forbids it , proclaiming itself in 1967 " the first atheist state in the world . " All 2,169 mosques , churches , monasteries , and other " centers of obscurantism and mysticism " have been closed , torn down , or transformed into recreation centers , clinics , warehouses , or stables . Shkoder 's great cathedral reverberates to the shouts of 2,000 basketball fans . Albania 's new generation knows only atheism . Marxist-Leninist faith replaces religious faith . Enver Hoxha 's books , serialized in newspapers , quoted on the radio , gleaned for slogans , serve as a New Testament . Hoxha is hailed as a messiah ? infinitely wise , farsighted , and benevolent , but also implacable toward his foes . Leader Maintains High Profile Living apart from his people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding in a curtained Mercedes , Enver Hoxha is omnipresent . His portrait looks down from walls everywhere , even from truck and tractor . His name is carved on hillsides in letters hundreds of feet high . His birthplace ? a two-story stone house in Gjirokaster ? is a national shrine . A master of Stalinist self-preservation , Hoxha has ruthlessly liquidated all opposition in the People 's Socialist Republic of Albania . The revolutionary elite , convinced that human nature can be shaped by incessant indoctrination , has set out to forge a new Albanian citizen who will unquestioningly make any sacrifice in his nation 's fight against " savage imperialist-revisionist encirclement " to build a socialist society free of the heresy of individualism , independent thought , or alien morality . While striving to remold its citizens , this tiny , once backward nation has pulled itself @# No co spiritual trol . Pe ( offensive moral v even the Burials , ground , by religi Turn literacy creased  |p556  up impressively by its bootstraps . Take the big metallurgical plant at Elbasan , called the Steel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Light of the Party ; a student enrollment of 700,000 against 56,000 in 1938 ; two radio transmitters in 1945 climbing to 52 in two decades ; average life expectancy nearly doubling in four decades ? certainly striking achievements . The regime is also trying to dismantle the patriarchal clan structure that has provided social cohesion in Albania 's mountain wilds . In doing so , it is stamping out vendettas. which , as late as 1920 , accounted for one out of four male deaths . It has suppressed blood vengeance for adultery . ( Highland tradition gave the husband the right to shoot his wife and her lover . Her family , in ritual approval , gave him a bullet ! ) The reformers put an end to infant betrothals and the sale of 12-year-old brides . and attacked customs chaining Albanian women , traditionally considered " long of hair and short of brains , " to an inferior role . @# @# No corner of Albanian life , material or spiritual , has escaped Hoxha 's drive for control . People with names " inappropriate or offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must change them . Not even the dead elude Hoxha 's reforming zeal . Burials , paid for by the state , are in common ground , without the traditional separations by religion . Turn over the glittering coin of increased literacy and you find the dark side of increased thought control , for the Directorate of Agitation and Propaganda determines what Albanians will read , just as the state determines who will work where , who will be rewarded , and who will be punished . Wary Society Closes Its Doors The harsh hand of history has embedded suspicion in the Albanian psyche . After three weeks in Albania , I realized how little I had been able to penetrate the facade of this portentous social experiment . Never in my travels about the world had I experienced so closed a society , had I felt so much an island . Accompanied and watched constantly , I felt that the conspicuous yellow car I traveled in was like the clapper that warned of the medieval leper 's approach . My guide , Bashkim Babani , would step behind me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph the outside of industrial plants but not observe them at work , visit a hydroelectric dam but not the powerhouse . At a distillery I was given raki to drink but could not see its making . Requests to visit families and homes were politely parried or ignored . No pictures of bunkers , no donkeys , nothing primitive of course . But Bashkim even stopped me from duplicating scenes on Albanian postcards . One citizen objected to my photographing children in front of Tirana 's puppet theater . Bashkim discouraged taking pictures of a wedding procession . The regime downplays such traditional festivities . Nor do I recall ever seeing a pet dog or cat , bourgeois luxuries . Once I struck up a direct conversation with a peasant in Turkish . Bashkim immediately switched to Albanian and translated the answers into the usual party jargon . Nor could I penetrate his defenses . He was correct and cordial , as were most Albanians . Only once did I encounter a breach of hospitality ? when a teenager on a collective grape farm near Shkoder spat in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to prime the pump by telling Bashkim of my life in Istanbul with my wife and son . But he never parted the curtain , as on Enver Hoxha 's Mercedes , to allow me a glimpse of his life and private thoughts . Indeed , he seemed to embody the very attitude , the very mask , that his nation so defiantly wears. @#
