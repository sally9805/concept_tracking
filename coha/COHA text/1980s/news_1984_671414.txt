" The staff had a champagne party when they heard the news , " said Jack Shoemaker , editor in chief of the house in Berkeley , Calif. // There are now 50 , 000 copies of " Son of the Morning Star " in print , plus an additional 11 , 000 through the Book-of- the-Month Club and the History Book Club . Moreover , North Point has ordered 25 , 000 more for delivery next month . " These figures are gratifying to us because it ' s not a how-to book or a book about some weird West Coast life style , the kind usually associated with California publishers , " Mr. Shoemaker said. // No one is likely to associate North Point with such books . It is one of the few publishing houses of any size that concentrate on belles-lettres - novels , poems , short stories , essays . Its authors include Guy Davenport , Reynolds Price , William Bronk , M.F.K. Fisher , Donald Hall , Kay Boyle and others who , when they sit down to write , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get is that Evan is a serious literary stylist , " Mr. Shoemaker said . He attributed the book ' s appeal to the combination of extraordinary reviews and press coverage , the enduring appeal of books about Custer , and above all to the blossoming of a writer ' s career. // " Evan ' s is that classic story of a writer who has written wonderful books and finally broke out , " Mr. Shoemaker said . " ' Mrs. Bridge ' is in its third printing and we were maybe its third publisher , " he added , referring to Mr. Connell ' s first novel , published in 1959 after rejections by eight houses . The book ' s protagonist is India Bridge , a middle-age mother of three who lives with her lawyer husband in Kansas City , Mo. , which also happens to be Mr. Connell ' s hometown . Ten years later , Mr. Connell wrote a sequel , " Mr. Bridge . " North Point has kept both books in print , as well as Mr. Connell ' s " Notes From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book-length meditative prose poem . One of North Point ' s first books was Mr. Connell ' s " Saint Augustine ' s Pigeon , " a collection of stories . Next year it will reprint " Points for a Compass Rose , " another prose poem. // Although " Mrs. Bridge " was a best seller , the 60-year-old Mr. Connell has not had an easy financial time of it . Three years ago , for example , Publishers Weekly noted that he worked at such jobs as post office clerk , gas meter reader and employment office clerk , which , along with writing book reviews , enabled him " just barely " to support himself. // But he has enjoyed the kind of critical acclaim that most writers can only dream about . He was nominated for national book awards in 1960 and 1974 , " Saint Augustine ' s Pigeon " ( 1980 ) was chosen by The New York Times as one of the notable books of the year , and " Son of the Morning Star " was recently nominated as one of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critics Circle. // Stockman Enthusiastic About ' City of Scandals ' // President Reagan ' s enthusiasm for George Gilder ' s " Wealth and Poverty " helped make that book about economics a best seller four years ago . This time around , the Reagan Administration - or at least one of its officials , David Stockman , director of the Office of Management and Budget - is enthusiastic about another book : Donald Lambro ' s " Washington - City of Scandals. " // Published in September , the book was recently described in The New York Times Book Review as " a valuable insider ' s view of the Government . " Its author , a syndicated columnist and a commentator for National Public Radio , argues that it is possible to cut the Federal budget sharply by trimming wasteful and unnecessary programs. // One chapter , listing 52 items that could be eliminated for a savings of $200 billion , appeared in the September issue of Washington magazine . It is that chapter that caught the attention of Mr. Stockman and was discussed in his conversations about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very detailed list , " said Edwin L. Dale Jr. , spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget . " In the initial Stockman presentation , wherever possible Stockman would link a proposed termination or change of program to one of three respected outside sources : The Lambro article , the Grace Commission report and the recent Heritage Foundation report . " The Grace Commission , the Presidential cost-cutting commission headed by the business executive J. Peter Grace , recommended ways the Reagan Administration could save more than $400 billion over three years . The Heritage Foundation ' s " Mandate for Leadership II , " which was presented to the Administration soon after last month ' s election , contains some 1 , 300 policy recommendations ranging from economics to foreign affairs. // Mr. Lambro ' s previous book was titled " Fat City . " It probably goes without saying that it too was about Congress , Government spending and Washington. // Condensed Version Of Gompers Memoirs // Samuel Gompers arrived in the United States from England in 1863 and the 14-year-old immigrant apprentice eventually rose from cigarmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1925 , the year after he died , E. P. Dutton published Mr. Gompers ' s two-volume autobiography , " Seventy Years of Life and Labor . " In those memoirs , the author discussed his philosophy and described conditions and customs of the workplace at the turn of the century. // A condensed version of the Gompers autobiography has just been published by the ILR Press , the publishing division of the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University . Edited by Nick Salvatore , a faculty member at the school , who won the Bancroft Prize for his biography of Eugene V. Debs , the new edition represents a little more than a quarter of the 1 , 100- page original . Mr. Salvatore writes that it is not meant to replace the original , but to make available the essence of the memoirs of Gompers , who more than anyone else influenced the structure and ultimate orientation of the institutions of American workers . The book , published in hard cover and paperback , can be ordered through bookstores. // //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
