Raymark Corp. , faced with the prospect that pending asbestos-related lawsuits may wipe out its insurance coverage , said its board has authorized management to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , if necessary . The former asbestos producer , which faces 24 , 000 suits asking for billions of dollars , said it is trying to avert a bankruptcy-law filing by offering to settle with asbestos plaintiffs for a small amount and by resolving problems with insurers . " That ' s not our plan , " to file for bankruptcy protection , said Harry D. Day , vice president and general counsel . " But we have to recognize if we can ' t sort out our insurance problems , we may have no choice . " If the Trumbull , Conn. - based concern were to file , it would be the second largest former asbestos producer to seek bankruptcy-law protection . Denver-based Manville Corp. , the huge building concern and former asbestos maker , made a controversial Chapter 11 filing in August 1982 after being flooded with asbestos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norristown , Pa. , also filed for bankruptcy-law protection in 1982 . Thousands of people have sued the former producers , claiming they suffered from exposure to the mineral , which was once widely used in building and piping insulation . Asbestos can cause cancer and other respiratory diseases , but they often don ' t show up for years after exposure . Unlike Manville , which had a healthy net worth of about $1 billion when it filed for bankruptcy-law protection , Raymark had a 1985 net worth of only $3. 6 million , Mr. Day said . And the company ' s auditors have qualified Raymark ' s financial statements every year since 1981 . For 1985 , Raymark posted a net loss of $18. 2 million on sales of $112. 4 million . The company , previously named Raybestos-Manhattan Inc. , makes energy absorption and transmission products , including brake linings . The board was forced to authorize the filing because of the chance of a huge jury verdict against Raymark and 12 other former asbestos producers named in a class-action suit that went to trial last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled its share of the suit two weeks into the trial for $7. 6 million , according to Rex Houston , lead counsel for the 551 plaintiffs represented in the class action . The remaining defendants also settled , bringing the total settlement to more than $100 million . By settling for less than the $150 million originally asked of Raymark and four of the other defendant companies , Raymark was able to avoid an immediate Chapter 11 filing , Mr. Day said . But he added that the company must resolve problems with insurers and negotiate a low settlement with representatives for thousands of asbestos plaintiffs if it has a chance of surviving . Of its $395 million of total insurance coverage , Raymark has $280 million left . But , in reality , the company may have only $30 million left , the amount remaining in its so-called first level excess coverage . Raymark may be blocked from collecting on coverage in its next level because one insurer is being liquidated and another is contesting its coverage .
