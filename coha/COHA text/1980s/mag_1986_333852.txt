For the better part of the past year , hundreds of Sandinista troops have wandered in and out of Honduras , looking for the rebel forces known as contras . And for most of that time , the Honduran military has looked the other way . On Dec. 6 , however , Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo shattered that arrangement by ordering his air force to strafe the Nicaraguan positions inside the country . Later that day , Azcona summoned U.S. Ambassador Everett Briggs and urgently appealed for U.S. logistical support . President Reagan responded promptly , authorizing an airlift . Last week U.S. troops flying twin- rotor Chinooks and Huey helicopters ferried hundreds of Honduran soldiers to within 20 miles of the Nicaraguan border . At the same time , Honduran pilots strafed targets inside Nicaragua . <P> On the surface , the provocative Honduran behavior was a response to a Sandinista attack on Honduran outposts in which three Honduran soldiers were injured and two taken prisoner . Under different circumstances , Azcona might have overlooked the Nicaraguan indiscretion , just as he has ignored more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iran-contra scandal swirling in Washington , the Honduran President was plainly seeking reassurance from the White House . His appeal for U.S. help seemed designed to gauge whether the arms scandal had shaken the Reagan Administration 's support for the rebels . More important , it tested U.S. resolve to come to the aid of cooperative allies in the region on short notice . Admitted one source close to the Azcona government : " Irangate has unnerved some top officials , and they just wanted to be sure they could count on Washington . " <P> While the White House 's quick response laid some doubts to rest , it did not answer the blunter question that is now being asked from Managua to Washington : Does the deepening U.S. crisis mean that it is curtains for the contras ? Although the rebels have held on through several funding crises in recent years , there are doubts in both the U.S. and Central America that they can survive the current ordeal . Last week , as the U.S. press analyzed the contras ' prospects in funereal tones , some officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the counterrevolution is nearly over , " said a Latin American military analyst . " If the contras could do something in the next few weeks , that might change things , but they are not capable of it . " Even a contra official saw the end coming . " We have got four months to show what we can do , " he said . " If we have n't made a very big impression by then , it 's all over . " <P> Before the arms scam erupted , the contras were already besieged by charges of corruption , human-rights abuses and military ineptitude . Congressional support was anything but assured after Democrats won control of the Senate in the November elections . Moreover , Washington 's Central American allies have long been skittish about the U.S. policy . Days before the Iran-contra link emerged , U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams warned , " The Central Americans are scared to death . They 're scared about our staying power . " Now Washington 's friends are all the more concerned that they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sympathize with their cause , " says one Honduran official of the contras . " But without American support , they 'll just become bandits. "
