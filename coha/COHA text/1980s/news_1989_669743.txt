Throughout his long lifetime , pianist/composer Franz Liszt ( 1811-1886 ) shook up a lot of people . Beethoven dubbed him a ' ' Young Turk . ' ' Clara Schumann dismissed the mature virtuoso as a ' ' smasher of pianos . ' ' In middle age , when Liszt took holy orders from the Roman Catholic Church , a monk sneered that he was ' ' Mephistopheles in the guise of a curate . ' ' Liszt himself once remarked that he was ' ' half Gypsy , half Franciscan. ' ' // // ' ' Truly great men are those who combine contrary qualities within themselves , ' ' Liszt once wrote . He may be forgiven for referring to himself . The contradictions are everywhere : // He was born into humble , lower-middle class circumstances , yet he eventually helped raise the status of ' ' artist ' ' to prestige and respectability . He was undeniably Hungarian , yet the circumstances of a mixed geographical background and the international character of his fame could accord him German and French credentials as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time , but his peak concertizing years occupied a scant decade . He began that career playing the magnificent new Erard pianos in glittering salons and ended it in a private monastic cell with an instrument that was out of tune and missing some notes . In the 1840s , he traveled across Europe by private stagecoach and traversed the Russian steppes by dogsled . But late in life he was content with second-class trains . There were numerous liaisons with women , but he never married . And tirelessly he championed the ' ' new German music ' ' of Richard Wagner ; yet when he died at a Wagner Festival in 1886 , his death went unannounced. // Public life and private paradox . Even today , Hollywood and the scandal sheets delight in him . But for the biographer and performer , Franz Liszt is a towering and unassailable monument . Two men have appeared in recent years to take up the challenge. // Alan Walker recently released the second book in his three-volume biography , ' ' Franz Liszt : The Weimar Years , 1848-1861 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , Dr. Walker now teaches at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario. // Leslie Howard is a pianist and musicologist currently involved in recording all of Liszt ' s solo piano works . Hyperion Records has released his seventh compact disc in a projected series of 48. // BOTH men agree that it is only a thorough re-evaluation of original source materials - music scores , letters , diaries , and documents - that a path can be cleared through the accumulated debris of misinformation and legend. // ' ' It ' s been about 18 years now since I realized that if a definitive work on Liszt were to appear , I ' d better do it myself , ' ' says Walker in an interview at the offices of his publisher , Alfred A. Knopf , here in New York . ' ' It dawned on me only slowly what I was getting into . . . . At first I could see no reason why a Liszt biography would take more than 10 years . Biographers , as a breed , tend to be lazy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I resolved to travel , and that doesn ' t come easily to me . But Liszt was a world traveler , and I decided to go out and buy a stout pair of boots and get into the field . Wherever I ' ve gone - Weimar , Budapest , Paris , Rome , London , Vienna , Poland , Washington D.C. - I ' ve found the name ' Liszt ' is magical . It will always make you new friends. ' ' // Like his subject , pianist Leslie Howard knows what it ' s like to storm across the globe on concert tours . Trained in musicology in Australia , he decided , after moving to London , that the sedentary life of an academic was not for him . Before starting his Liszt project four years ago , he had already traveled extensively in pursuit of other interests like Percy Grainger , Alexander Glazunov , and Anton Rubinstein , producing many world-premiere concerts and recordings of their works. // ' ' I think it ' s enormously important with almost every composer to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influences were , from all directions , ' ' says Mr. Howard. // He adds that cataloging the composer ' s more than 700 keyboard compositions is wickedly difficult . ' ' Liszt wrote no opus numbers to his work , ' ' he explains . ' ' After the end of his public concertizing in 1847 , he bought back at his own expense all his published works , except his transcriptions , in order to improve and rewrite them . The public knew him mostly as a virtuoso , but he wanted to develop as a composer . Anyway , many of his works are now difficult to properly date ; others exist in several different versions ; and some others - like ' album souvenirs ' written into guest books - remain unknown to this day , although , I think I have found most of them. ' ' // ' ' That ' s the paradox , isn ' t it , ' ' exclaims Professor Walker . ' ' We think we know a lot through the more than 20 , 000 titles in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s just that much more room for error ! Unlike other composers , whose biographies appeared after their deaths , Liszt ' s public demanded information about him then . What they got was the kind of thing we see with today ' s media superstars . The gossip mongers and journalists obligingly circulated the most spurious material , usually just hours ahead of his arrival in a city . And that became the basis for the first biographies. ' ' // WALKER and Howard confront many of the legends head on . For example , Walker minutely examines the available evidence surrounding the famous kiss of benediction Beethoven supposedly bestowed upon the young Liszt in Vienna . It may have happened , he concludes , but not in the ways we have been told. // As for the sensational piano tours from 1839 to 1847 , when Liszt conquered the world , the picture is unexpectedly sober . He frequently traveled by stagecoach at night , unwilling to give up his daylight hours . He endured a grueling schedule , snowstorms , and numerous accidents . Once he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing someone else to sit inside ; and upon arrival had , literally , to be dug out from under a pile of snow. // What about the legends of Liszt the demon , tossing off unplayable compositions at the keyboard , leaving behind no secrets to their performance ? // ' ' He never wrote anything that was impossible or even very awkward , ' ' claims Howard . ' ' Other composers did that ! His works may look and sound hair-raisingly difficult - and make no mistake about it , you can ' t sight-read these things - but they are all within reasonable bounds . Yes , you have to have stamina , but part of the secret is not to expend energy in useless places or in keeping muscles taut that are better relaxed. ' ' // THE prevailing legends about Liszt ' s showmanship - the fainting countesses , the frantic riots over a glove tossed from the platform , the collapsing pianos , and the wild tossing mane of long hair surmounting what his first mistress , Marie d ' Agoult , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only part of the story. // ' ' It was said of him that he not only played the music , ' ' says Walker , ' ' but he played the building . He knew that buildings were also musical instruments , whose acoustics and reverberation time could influence the piano sound . So , early on , he placed his pianos at right angles to the auditorium with the lid up , so as to deflect the sound straight into the room . At a concert - he first used the term ' ' recital ' ' in London in 1740 - he seemed to be saying , ' C ' est moi , c ' est Musique ! ' This concert is me and nobody else. ' ' // Colossal arrogance ? ' ' Not so , ' ' says Howard . He cites the hundreds of transcriptions Liszt made of the music of others . ' ' He brought the songs of Schubert and Schumann . . . to many people who didn ' t know them . He rigorously transcribed the symphonies of Beethoven and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestras. ' ' // Walker points out that ' ' his concerts more often than not helped charitable causes , like the building of a Beethoven monument or supporting victims of political strife and natural catastrophe . He was one of the most generous musicians in history. ' ' // Both biographer and performer have a long way to go in their respective projects . Walker ' s third volume , due out in five years , will document what Liszt called ' ' the three-pronged life ' ' of his last years , divided among the three cities of Weimer , Budapest , and Rome . Howard estimates that he will produce an average of six compact discs a year of the piano music over the next decade or so . ' ' A project like this has been attempted several times , ' ' he admits , ' ' but nobody ' s ever gotten anywhere near finishing it . But I want to play everything . Everything.
