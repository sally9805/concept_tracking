Thanks to its renown as the birthplace of Jesus Christ , Bethlehem has long since ceased to be the " little town " described in the popular carol . It is instead a city whose 35,000 residents have traditionally been joined by so many pilgrims and tourists that there is often no room in the inns . But the boom and bustle came to a rather sudden halt in December 1987 , when the intifadeh arose among the Arabs in Israel 's occupied territories . Last Christmas only 5,000 visitors  --  half the normal turnout  --  attended Bethlehem 's elaborate holiday observance . In the year since then , an estimated 300 Palestinian Arabs have been killed in the uprising , eleven in the Bethlehem area . <P> Last week a decree went out from the Bethlehem city council that will make Christmas 1988 the gloomiest yet . To express solidarity with the Arab cause , the leaders ordered historic Manger Square to be bare of the usual tinsel and twinkling lights . The city is also canceling the annual Boy Scout parade and its reception for visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispirited this year to hold their customary family celebrations . The new Latin patriarch Michel Sabbah , a pointed critic of Israel 's policy toward Arab residents , will still lead the centuries-old procession across the square for midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity . But , all in all , says Roman Catholic Deputy Mayor Hanna Nasser , " it is a very sad Christmas . " <P> The sadness extends from Bethlehem to nearby Jerusalem and many West Bank towns , where Christians , who are overwhelmingly Arabs , say they too will be forgoing glittering displays and traditional festivities . Most of the country 's Christian leaders see no end to the intifadeh . They fear that their flocks , already reduced by a century of emigration to the West , could gradually decline into virtual extinction , as has already happened to the once grand Greek Orthodox community in Muslim Turkey . <P> As prospects for peace inside and outside Israel falter , rumors fly in Christian neighborhoods about people seeking visas to move to North and South America . Since Christians are a minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishop Loutfi Laham , they " need stabilization and peace in order to stay here . " For the moment , at least , the fears of a disappearing flock appear exaggerated , judging by estimates from Israeli sources . They show that there are 103,000 Christians in Israel , including the Jerusalem area , compared with only 67,000 in 1967 . During the same period , the total number of believers in the occupied West Bank has held steady at around 30,000 . <P> Despite such statistics , Christians have already become a minority in places where they traditionally predominated . Bethlehem , for instance , a Christian stronghold from the very earliest days of the faith , now has a Muslim majority as a result of high Islamic birthrates and an influx from refugee camps . The growing influence of Israel 's Orthodox Jewish political movements adds to anxieties . Says Bethlehem 's Nasser : " Jewish and Arab fundamentalism are the same . They are like sisters , and we fear the sisters are going to clash , and we will be caught in the middle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
