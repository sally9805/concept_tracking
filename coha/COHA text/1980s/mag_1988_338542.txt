Bill McKay and Harry Williams were company men and proud of it . Vice presidents at Ashland Oil , they had a combined 35 years of experience in the oil business . McKay earned $150,000 a year and lived with his wife and two children in a handsome four-bedroom brick house in Russell , Ky. , a quiet neighborhood less than a mile from company headquarters . Williams , who lived nearby , frequently traveled to New York City and Washington as Ashland 's executive in charge of corporate lobbying . In 1983 , however , the two men felt they had to blow the whistle on their employer : they told federal investigators that Ashland Oil had paid bribes to Middle Eastern government officials to obtain crude supplies . Before long , McKay and Williams were fired , and their comfortable lives began to come apart . Unable to find jobs in the industry , they filed suit in 1984 against Ashland , charging that they were unfairly dismissed merely for telling the truth . <P> Last week a federal jury in Covington , Ky. , ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would amount to 52% of the company 's fiscal 1987 earnings . McKay , 45 , won $44.6 million , while Williams , % 47 , was awarded $24.9 million . McKay 's judgment , which was higher because his salary at Ashland was larger than Williams ' , is one of the largest awards ever granted to an individual claimant . Ashland will appeal , and may be able to get the damages reduced . Because the company will not have to pay anything until the appeals process is complete  --  something that could take years  --  the verdict should have no immediate financial effect . <P> The company 's troubles began in 1979 , when the U.S. Government embargoed oil from Iran . Since Ashland had depended on Iran for 25% of its crude supplies , the firm scrambled to find alternative sources . In so doing , the jury ruled , Ashland resorted to bribery : in 1980 and 1981 , according to court records , the company paid $49 million to government officials in Oman and Saudi Arabia and a government representative in Abu Dhabi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments were legal and were made to private consultants . <P> The four-year court battle has been hard on the whistle-blowers . Says McKay : " I would not urge anyone to subject their families to what I 've had to do . If you stand up and insist on not going along with wrongdoing , you 're going to have people try to crush you . " Recalls Williams : " Ashland Oil had been my life . I felt fiercely loyal to the company , but I felt betrayed . " Both men believe they were blacklisted by the petroleum industry after they left Ashland . The executives can hope , though , that their victory may bring about some change in corporate ethics . Says Thomas Dunfee , a professor of social responsibility at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School , of the Covington judgment : " I think it 's likely to give managers courage when they are asked to do something illegal .
