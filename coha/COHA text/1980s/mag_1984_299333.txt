Vartan Gregorian rescues the New York Public Library <P> The 1970s were bitter years for the New York Public Library . Because of budget restraints , the main research library , housed in Carrre and Hastings ' magnificent 1911 neoclassical palace at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street , which once was open 87 hours a week , could afford to stay open only 43 hours . Rain was leaking through the roof and into the stacks , endangering a number of the library 's 6.5 million volumes . New Yorkers looked upon the library , supported for eight decades by a combination of private philanthropy and tax dollars , as a shabby invalid . Even " Patience " and " Fortitude , " the majestic marble lions that guard the library 's entrance , appeared sooty and defeated . <P> But today the institution is reclaiming its position as one of the world 's great libraries , thanks to a new lion in its president 's office . Vartan Gregorian , 50 , a pudgy , bearded historian who bears more than a passing resemblance to Patience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system 's four research and 82 branch libraries in 1981 , after eight years as professor , dean and provost at the University of Pennsylvania . Born in Iran , Gregorian is an Armenian American who speaks Russian , Turkish , Persian , French and Arabic in addition to his first language , Armenian . He has a disarming habit of dropping articles like the when he speaks English ( a surprise , for instance , " comes out of blue " ) . Yet he has eloquently convinced New Yorkers that their library , which contains such treasures as a Gutenberg Bible and George Washington 's Farewell Address in his own hand , is nothing less than a central force in the preservation and transmission of civilization . Says Gregorian : " This library is as important as any university . " <P> When he was passed over for the presidency of the University of Pennsylvania in 1980 , faculty and students staged campuswide protests . His supporters in New York , who range from Mayor Edward Koch to Philanthropist and Civic Leader Brooke Astor , also praise him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Heiskell , chairman of the New York Public Library and former chairman of Time Inc. , says , " Greg has a strange combination of scholarship , energy , drive , salesmanship , enthusiasm and even a certain naivet . " <P> Those qualities have helped Gregorian prevail over what once seemed a nearly hopeless financial morass . When he arrived , the library was balancing its budget not only by cutting back services but by eating into its $80 million endowment . Then Gregorian began stating his case to potential givers . It was both blunt and plain : the library is necessary and therefore it should be supported . " I have never relied on the guilt or vanity of donors , " explains Gregorian . " Charity you give out of pity . Philanthropy is for a higher cause . "
