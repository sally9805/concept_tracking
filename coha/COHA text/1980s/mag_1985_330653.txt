What next ? After the shocks of the past six months , including the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and a leak in a chemical plant in Bhopal that killed more than 2,500 people , Indians were stunned last week by yet another national crisis . This time the bombshell was the exposure of an espionage network that had penetrated to the highest reaches of the government . Before clamping a tight lid on details of the investigation , India 's youthful new leader , Rajiv Gandhi , whose Congress ( I ) Party won a sweeping majority in national elections only a month ago , gravely informed Parliament that the country 's security had been compromised by a spy scandal that he characterized as " the most serious ever . " <P> Thus far , at least 15 government officials and three businessmen have been arrested and charged with violations of the Official Secrets Act and criminal conspiracy against the government . Several of them were officials in the defense and commerce ministries , and three men held key positions in the Prime Minister 's secretariat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to P.C. Alexander , a top aide to both Indira and Rajiv Gandhi and one of the country 's most respected civil servants . Alexander , who was not connected to the espionage activity , resigned after accepting " moral responsibility " for the leakage of hundreds of files from his office . At least 60 other people were under surveillance or being questioned by authorities . <P> The government is unlikely to disclose what secrets were compromised . But in his position close to the Prime Minister 's office , Kher would have had access to all the secret files concerning defense , foreign policy , nuclear power and the entire range of official activity . The Hindustan Times , New Delhi 's largest English-language daily , reported that documents handed over to foreign agents from the Defense Ministry " staggered the imagination of investigating officials . " Said a senior investigator : " The security system and our vital papers have been stripped clean . " <P> New Delhi carefully refrained from naming foreign governments that might have received classified information . But the French , who have landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past few ( years , were linked to the operation . The French deputy military attache , Colonel Alain Bolley , hastily left New Delhi after the Indian government asked for his recall . Bolley was alleged to have ties to the CIA . In Paris , French Foreign Ministry officials refused to comment on the case .
