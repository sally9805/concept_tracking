The last time a new name plate appeared at General Motors was 1926 , when the company introduced the Pontiac . Last week another one was added . Chevrolet , Pontiac , Oldsmobile , Buick and Cadillac suddenly got a baby brother . In GM 's boldest plan yet to counter Japanese imports , Chairman Roger Smith announced that it would set up an entirely new company , called Saturn Corp. , to produce its long-planned line of subcompact cars . Smith called Saturn " the key to GM 's long-term competitiveness , survival and success as a domestic producer . " <P> GM describes its new offspring as a " clean sheet " operation . While wholly owned by GM , the company will have its own network of dealers , its own labor contract with the United Auto Workers , its own factory , engineering and design staffs , and even its own president . He is Joseph J. Sanchez , 54 , a former Oldsmobile division boss and head of GM Latin American subsidiaries . Sanchez will operate much like the chief executive of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not going to handicap him with a lot of preordained rules . " Freed from the heavy , established GM structure , Saturn 's managers are supposed to move swiftly on several fronts to make cars that are , in both quality and cost , competitive with Japanese models . Currently , for example , Japanese automakers can turn out a vehicle for about $1,500 less than GM , Ford or Chrysler . At the same time , though Detroit 's products are rapidly improving , the Japanese reputation for quality , as surveyed in publications like Consumer Reports , is generally higher among buyers . <P> Saturn Corp . will begin life with about $150 million in capital , but it is expected to spend $5 billion during the next three to five years . About $3.5 billion of that , said Smith , will go toward building a vast factory of &; approximately 4 million sq . ft. at a site not yet determined by GM 's planners . The plant could be built in a little more than two years , with cars rolling off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says an impatient Smith : " I do n't like to wait long for anything . " The effort could create as many as 20,000 jobs and turn out 400,000 to 500,000 cars annually . That would make it bigger than AMC , the fourth largest domestic producer . Says Sanchez : " I would like to be Chrysler 's size as soon as possible . " The car will initially come in two models , a four-door sedan and two-door coupe . Other models will come later . The first Saturns may cost about $8,000 . <P> Saturn is part of the complex GM strategy for competing in the small-car market . While American automakers are fairly efficient in building large models , they are less successful in turning out small cars , where the profits are not great . Many auto-industry executives believe that because of higher costs and a foreign-exchange rate that favors Japanese exports to the U.S. , it is now almost impossible for an American auto company to build a car in the U.S. , sell it for less than $7,000 and make a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. from Japan 's Suzuki and Isuzu , and it has plans to bring in more from its South Korean partner , Daewoo . GM is also manufacturing small cars in a venture with Toyota in Fremont , Calif.
