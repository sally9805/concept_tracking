As the head of a special committee on cost control , Peter Grace , chairman of W.R. Grace , made thousands of recommendations on how to slash the U.S. budget deficit . Since he delivered his report to President Reagan in January 1984 , Grace has waged a personal crusade against the Government 's spendthrift habits . His company recently hired Movie Director Ridley Scott ( Alien , Blade Runner ) to create a TV commercial that would alert viewers to the horrors of huge deficits . The result is The Deficit Trials , 2017 A.D. , a futuristic fantasy that cost about $300,000 to produce . Set in a mammoth courtroom , it shows a twelve-year-old prosecutor trying his elders for saddling his generation with a crushing debt burden . <P> Grace hoped that the commercial would premiere on network TV following Reagan 's State of the Union address . But CBS , NBC and ABC refused , calling the ad too politically charged . Not easily deterred , Grace took his ad to local and cable channels and got a more enthusiastic reception . The Cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual stations in Chicago , New York and Washington , agreed to air Deficit Trials following Reagan 's speech .
