Any decline in the gargantuan U.S. trade deficit is welcome news . Last week the Government gave cause for restrained cheers in reporting that the trade deficit narrowed slightly in September , falling to $12.56 billion , down $760 million from the previous month . The drop may have resulted from the weakened dollar , which has depreciated by as much as 40% against the Japanese yen and major European currencies since it peaked in February 1985 . Declared Secre- tary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige : " We have turned the corner on the trade deficit . " <P> But that is hardly guaranteed . When measured against a wider group of currencies , the dollar is stronger than it seems . The greenback has fallen in value by just 6.8% against the Taiwanese yuan and has risen 4.3% against the Korean won . <P> Still , there is reason for optimism on the trade front . At week 's end Japan and the U.S. unveiled a package of cooperative measures aimed at improving trade relations and both nations ' economies . The central bank of Japan cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial banks , from 3.5% to 3% . Japanese officials also agreed to cut taxes and raise spending . These stimulative measures may boost demand for imports from America . The U.S. , in turn , vowed to cut its budget deficit and to fight protectionist measures .
