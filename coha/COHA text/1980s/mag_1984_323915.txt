In absentia , Andropov guides two key Kremlin meetings <P> The rush-hour traffic on Moscow 's broad boulevards was moving at a crawl when the convoys of black ZIL limousines , amber lights gleaming , appeared out of the morning mist . The motorcades whipped by at 70 m.p.h. , down empty center lanes marked off for official traffic . The more than 300 members of the Communist Party 's Central Committee were on their way to the Kremlin for their annual winter session . All of them but one . There was no hint of the whereabouts of the Soviet Union 's head of state , Yuri Andropov , 69 , who had not been seen in public since Aug. 18 . In his role as Party General Secretary , Andropov normally would run this very important policy meeting . Would he dramatically reappear , thus dispelling the rumors that he was too ill to lead his country effectively ? <P> The first news from the closed-door Central Committee plenum came early in the evening . The official TASS press agency wire fell silent and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency 's English-language service clicked back to life , teasingly printing out a test line again and again : " The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs . " Then came an equally puzzling message . The Central Committee members had " acquainted themselves " with the text of an Andropov speech , reported the TASS dispatch . But had they heard Andropov speak ? When the text of the address finally clattered over the wire , all doubt was removed . " I deeply regret that because of temporary causes , I will not be able to attend the session of the plenum , " wrote Andropov . He went on to explain that he had given the party program " much thought and was preparing to speak and outline some of my ideas . " <P> Details of the illness that kept Andropov from delivering his message in person remain as murky as ever . Soviet spokesmen have claimed for weeks that their leader is recuperating from a cold . But Andropov 's failure to appear at the all-important Central Committee meeting and , later in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's parliament , belied any such nonsense . Andropov is suffering from a serious illness and , presumably , is slowly recovering . Says a top-ranking U.S. official : " The truth is that no one really knows what has happened to Andropov . " That apparently included Western intelligence services .
