 | Frank Stella regularly delights the art world with his eye-popping extravagance . The most celebrated abstract artist of his generation , he now creates mostly metal " relief paintings " that project from the wall . They are exercises in controlled exuberance that dazzle the eye without dismaying the mind . Each new show yields work that does not repeat what came before ; each attracts crowds , buyers , comment . It seems fitting that the Museum of Modern Art , having given Stella a retrospective in 1970 when he was only 33 , should now mount an exhibit of Stella 's art from 1970 to 1987. * Stella , who is 51 , aims at greatness . No contemporary painter works harder , in the words of the exhibit 's curator , William Rubin , to " make it better . " Whether the art is as great as the aspiration , however , is arguable . Stella himself believes abstract art is in crisis . He has written a book , " Working Space " ( Harvard . 1986 ) , which grew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help clarify its prospects . The ex- hibit at MOMA is therefore both a salute to a major artist and a report on the vitality of a great tradition . pain Stella has always been a no-nonsense painter . As a young man , he admired the visual strength of some abstract expres- sionism , particularly the " allover " compo- sitions of Jackson Pollock , which did not emphasize one part of a painting over an- other . But he distrusted the mumbo jumbo that accompanied the style ? the emphasis on myth , spirit and the artist 's personal touch . Painting , he thought , should con- centrate on the power of painting , not on illustrating other things . Stella developed a pared-down art , based upon using strong geometric patterns as images . His fa- mous formulation of his work was " What you see is what you see . " forr Sublime rudeness : In the early 1970s , Stella entered a new period . Abstract painting looked increasingly effete : explo- rations of the edge , flirtings with the pic- ture plane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fresh territory . In the " Polish Village " se-ries of the early 1970s ? " Piaski III " ( 1973 ) is an example ? he brought the third dimension into his pictures . He began to project his paintings into actual space . A sublime rudeness entered his art . He used curved lines , giving up his reliance on straight lines , and jazzed up his color . The " Exotic Birds " series of the late ' 70s displays a new kind of pictorial drama . Its most important element is an increasingly baroque handling of space . Stella began to compose swirling , wildly complex pictures , in which he used  | space as trickily as an old master foreshort= ening figures on a church cupola . Yet there was always method to the madness . Or , put another way , structure in the screech . Stella has a lot of engineer in him . He usually works out the reliefs on graph paper and in maquettes before constructing the pieces at the factory . The forms themselves , while seeming spontaneous , typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " ship curve " that dominates " Steller 's Albatross " ( 1976 ) . In more recent pieces , he sometimes used scrap from the studio or factory . In " Marsaxlokk Bay " ( 1983 ) , you can see the metal plate from which forms were cut for other works . Power of color : The most important order , however , is formal . For all its craziness , a Stella holds together in the eye . The artist rhymes shape . He adjusts the power of color : a form that pushes forward , for example , may be painted a blue that pulls back . Often he contrasts actual space with the painted illusion of space . Usually the shapes operate within a rectangular field , which is often brilliantly disrupted or merely implied . The result is a sense of fullness . Of complexity understood , of spontaneity reconciled to order ? of serious fun . Stella says he wants to construct " a pictorial space that accommodates the reach of all our gestures , imaginative as well as physical . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Rubens and Caravaggio , whose work escaped the mannerist enervation of their time by expanding the " space " of painting ; he particularly admired the " projective , spherically informed pictorial space " of Caravaggio . Stella obviously hopes the " projection " in his own work will establish a fresh space in which abstract art can once again become great . Perhaps . But Stella more likely marks the end than the beginning of a tradition . Rubin has written of the artist 's search for inspiration in architecture and sculpture ; he has even suggested that the geometric forms in the recent " Cones and Pillars " series ( such as " Lo sciocco senza paura " ) attempt to reclaim from older figurative art a kind of " narrative drama , " a " cast of characters " that tells a story " more pictorial than literal . " This is the mark of an artist searching through a tradition for signs of life ? who sums up , exaggerates , casts a wide net . Such an artist is often particularly fluent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that arouses some doubts . Modernism itself , having entered the mainstream , long ago lost its edginess . Corporations buy it , museums show it , people like it . Stella , the modernist master , is the ideal major artist of the moment . For art historians , his work evolves with lecture-perfect tidiness . For collectors ( or consumers ) , he provides a new model every year . He 's got low style ? the graffiti glitter ? and high style ? the brilliant compositions . In a 1985 Art in America article , the poet and critic Carter Ratcliff suggested @# @# @# that Stella is a kind of " image administrator , " an engineer providing images that suit a bureaucratic culture . There 's something to what Ratcliff says . The Museum of Modern Art is making a kind of monument of modernism . Rubin has curated a series of great shows that have an air of summing up . One can easily see Stella in MOMA 's central academic line : late Cezanne , Picasso , Pollock , now Stella . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects for institutions of power . Great artists have often done so . But there 's also a feeling of loss in Stella 's fluency . Stella eschews the spiritual ambitions of earlier abstract artists . An unabashed formalist , he believes that the core of modernism is abstract , and he is right . Perhaps a little too right . His predecessors struggled toward abstract art . They recognized the critical importance of formal issues but nonetheless layered their art with other passions , confusions , hopes . This gives their work a density that Stella , a supremely knowing artist , does not possess . His art is a touch too nakedly bright . Cezanne said , " I am the primitive of the method I have invented . " Stella is never less than professional . NEWSWEEK : OCTOBER 19 , 1987 83
