The Barry Keating comic-book musical that inaugurated the new Criterion Center Stage Right theater is a polished high-tech version of the original that first amused audiences at the Ark Theater in SoHo . The show has been slightly enlarged , although even on Broadway it retains a convivial Off Broadway feeling . In that and other senses , it has some of the appeal of " Little Shop of Horrors " and is the very opposite of Andrew Lloyd Webber ' s " Starlight Express . " This is a vest-pocket rather than a fast-track musical. // What " Starmites " has is a childlike fancifulness and a genuine affection for its genre , for its labyrinthine detail as well as its exclamatory dialogue . Mr. Keating , who conceived the show , composed the score and co-wrote the book with Stuart Ross , is clearly a comic-book fanatic. // The cast is headed by the lithesome Liz Larsen , playing a teen-age earthling with a passion for comics . In a time and space warp , she turns out to be the legendary Milady , a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a state of suspended animation . Her adventures lead her into the nether regions of Innerspace to rescue the solar system from self-destruction - and from such societal impediments as tabloid television . The show has its share of social commentary , although it still does not have a sharply satiric storyline . At times , " Starmites " veers perilously close to the subject it is spoofing. // The heroine is a neo-feminist version of all those storybook young women who were flown - or blown away - to kingdom come . In this case , the " lost boys " are street urchins in sneakers and ragged dungarees . Their mini-membership includes a lead singer and a backup trio that needs absolutely no encouragement to break into a song like the catchy title number . Milady ' s comrade in arms is the lead Starmite , clean-cut despite his name , Spacepunk . He is a variation on Luke Skywalker ( the actor , Brian Lane Green , bears a certain resemblance to Harrison Ford ) . // The quest leads the couple to a Darth Vader-land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first version of the show , the Cruelty looked like a cross between a French horn and a kewpie doll . On Broadway , it becomes a glistening heavy-metal guitar . In neither instance is it as imaginative as it should be . The book is also burdened by too many references by Ms. Larsen to chapter and verse in her comic-book collection back on earth . If she really knew how every episode was going to turn out , she could have cut to the chase. // The most salutary approach is to sit back in the comfortable new Criterion Center theater and enjoy the show ' s assets . These include Mr. Keating ' s eclectic pop-rock score , which occasionally pauses for a sweet ballad or a gospel number between the hard-driving 60 ' s-style melodies . Some of Mr. Keating ' s lyrics are simplistic , but others have a cartoon cleverness , which is something that could also be said about the show itself. // To its credit , " Starmites " never takes itself too seriously and is always tongue in cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , is appealing as the damsel who can single-handedly overcome distress but does not want to push her pluck too far . Zestfully , she sets her character in her opening anthem , " Superhero Girl. " // The actress also doubles as her other self , a homely Innerspace teen-ager on a postnasal trip . In both her guises , she is arm in arm with Mr. Green , playing a super hero who is sometimes so busy expressing himself rhetorically that he forgets he is meant to be a man of action . Ms. Larsen and Mr. Green are nicely matched for duets , and Bennett Cale , Victor Trent Cook and Christopher Zelno are their helpful support team. // The plot cauldron bubbles with the character of Diva , the Queen of the Banshees and an enemy who becomes friendly under fire . In a role that might have been made to order for Bette Midler , Sharon McNight is power-packed . Her signature song , " Hard to Be Diva , " is a lowdown growl of cheerful discontent with celebrity . As she sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so much harder not to be . " Ms. McNight also plays Diva ' s opposite , the earthling ' s nagging mother. // The Banshees are Diva ' s women warriors . Unfortunately , these backup belters are beyond camp , with the lead singer a dominatrix who might be more at home in an operatic version of " Springtime for Hitler . " " Starmites " goes too far at times , but perhaps that is in the nature of the comic-book style . The fantasy elements are enhanced in Larry Carpenter ' s resourceful production . In its extended program credits , the show lists not only a chief pyrotechnician but also an apprentice pyrotechnician . Whenever there is a momentary lapse , special effects - laser beams , a shower of stars - and Ms. Larsen herself come to the rescue . <> <> Star Lures <> <> STARMITES , music and lyrics by Barry Keating ; book by Stuart Ross and Mr. Keating ; choreography by Michele Assaf ; directed and staged by Larry Carpenter ; sets by Lowell Detweiler ; costumes by Susan Hirschfeld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; musical direction and dance arrangements by Henry Aronson ; orchestrations and sound effects by James McElwaine ; associate musical direction and vocal arrangements by Dianne Adams ; assistant choreographer , T.
