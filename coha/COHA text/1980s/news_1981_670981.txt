The debate over the coal severance taxes has reached the United States Supreme Court , which is expected to rule next week on a lawsuit brought by several Middle Western electrical utilities that use Western coal and seek to have a 30 percent Montana tax declared unconstitutional . The utilities want the High Court to overturn lower court rulings upholding the tax and order new judicial hearings to test its legality. // Opponents of the severance tax rates say they contribute to higher fuel bills and benefit one region of the nation at the expense of another . Western officials say they need the tax revenues to help meet the costs of rapid energy development in the region. // Western politicians regard the challenges to the taxes , including proposed legislation in Congress that would impose a 12. 5 percent ceiling on coal severance tax rates , as an assault on states ' rights . <> <> Symptom of Regional Ill-Will // But , more important , opposition to the taxes by mostly Middle Western and Eastern utilities and Congressional representatives is interpreted here as reflecting broader regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wealth and population. // " What the Eastern states want to do is take all of our resources , and deny us the ability to raise money to meet the problems caused by that development , " said State Senator Thomas W. Towe of Montana . " That way , they get all the coal and leave us with all the problems . " It is a clear-cut case of energy crisis colonialism. " // For the Reagan Administration , the growing debate over severance taxes poses potential political problems . It frames a regionally divisive issue , and Westerners are clearly counting on the President , whom they number one of their own , for support in any Congressional battle to enforce a 12. 5 percent limit on state coal severance taxes. // So far , the White House has not taken a formal position on the issue . The legislation pending in both the Senate and House has the support of many Congressmen from the Middle West and Northeast , from major electrical utilities that use Western coal and from an organization called the National Coal Consumers Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <> <> Comparison to Arab States // The issue has provoked some rather emotional talk . Last weekend , at a conference here on severance taxes , sponsored by the National Conference of State Legislatures , Representative James L. Oberstar , Democrat of Minnesota , warned of " the eventual creation of a United Arab Emirates of six or seven Western superstates which will have all the resources. " // Earlier , Gov . Ed Herschler of Wyoming said he resented being depicted as a " blue-eyed Arab holding the rest of America hostage to an energy ranson . " Mr. Herschler suggested the problem was that " the West has been grubbing to the East for 200 years , and now the shoe is on the other foot. " // Only Montana ' s 30 percent tax exceeds the proposed 12. 5 percent ceiling . The rate levied by Wyoming is officially 10. 5 percent , though some critics have argued that the effect of additional taxes that also apply to coal production put it closer to 17 percent. // But Western politicians have become increasingly alarmed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Congress , because some see those moves as a symbolic challenge to the region as a whole . <> <> ' We ' ve Got Our Work Cut Out ' // " If a vote were taken on this issue in Congress today , I ' m afraid we would lose , " said Mr. Towe , the Montana State Senator . " The fact is that the electrical utilities and the coal consumer groups have been better organized and have a headstart on us . We ' ve got our work cut out in selling our case. " // Under the auspices of the Western Governors ' Policy Office , which represents the governors of 11 Mountain and High Plains States and Alaska , several governors gathered in Denver last month to plan a more aggressive strategy for opposing limits on severance taxes. // Among other things , the State of Montana this month hired a fulltime lobbyist to carry its case to Congress , and the policy office ' s representatives say attempts are being made to forge political coalitions not only with other regions but also with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western states. // " For many in the West , severance taxes are a symbolic issue , an instance of us against them , " says Mary Pat Wilson , a staff member . " And key to this is a perception that coal , and the West , have been unfairly singled out , since a wide variety of taxes are exported by many other states on a range of processed agricultural products and durable goods , not to mention other resources . " <> <> Other States ' Taxes Cited // Indeed , the policy office says that not only do 25 states levy severance taxes on the extraction of a wide range of resources , from oil to zinc , but also that in some cases the revenues those taxes produce far exceed what is earned by Western coal levies. // Texas , for example , earned $1 billion in 1979 as a result of a 4. 6 percent severance tax on oil produced in the state . By comparison , Montana ' s 30 percent tax on coal earned the state $42 million. // Moreover , proponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of the delivered price of coal for utilities , since they are levied on just-mined coal , before transportation and storage charges are added on . For example , coal that costs $6. 50 a ton just out of the mine in Wyoming costs $28. 46 a ton by the time it arrives at a coal-burning electrical generator at a utility in Texas . The difference in price results from railroad transportation charges set by the Interstate Commerce Commission. // " If consumers want to blame someone for the price of their electricity , don ' t blame Wyoming , " says Governor Herschler . " Blame the Federal Government . " <> <> Western Coal Industry Growing // Meanwhile , Western officials argue that the growing demand for lowsulfur Western coal will continue to cause economic and social disruptions in their states , which have small populations and a narrow economic base and consequentily lack the ability to absorb rapid growth easily. // Critics of the coal severance taxes say the taxes are rewarding energy- producing states at the expense of electrical consumers elsewhere. // At the meeting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the taxes would be " unhealthy competition which will punish the consumer states at the expense of the producing states.
