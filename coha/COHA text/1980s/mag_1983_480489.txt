KITING his lives of the saints ( as he explicitly calls Tolstoy and Gandhi ) , Martin Green wants to hurry on ahead to the saintliness , is impatient with their merely temporal deeds and choices : thus for instance tells us that by 1862 Tolstoy ? already thirty-four ? still had n't even got as far as fame and marriage ; " had not yet written a full-length novel , which was the greatest artistic form of his period , and he had not married , which was the period 's major mode of eroticism.

" ( Writers without religious credentials ought to bear in mind that a bluenose definition is more imposing when it has the threat of hell behind it . ) Anyhow before the end of 1862 sex and art had moved front and center ( temporarily ) in Tolstoy 's life : he had married Sonya Bers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modeled on Sonya 's sexy sister Tanya . Nineteenth-century fictional heroines like Tolstoy 's Natasha , Green would probably tell us , are the period 's major lightning rods for that ever popular though primitive discharge , human eroticism . In what Tolstoy no doubt means to be the novel 's klARPER'S/JULY 1983 61 most uninhibitedly physical and sensual episode , Prince Andrei is fortunate enough to happen to eavesdrop on Natasha as , invisible but audible from her window above his , she leans out gazing raptly up at the moon during the small hours of a balmy spring night , in the sheer bliss of her own material presence unable to calm herself or sleep , nubile Natasha who exclaims to her sleepy because not nearly so sensual cousin ( named Sonya ! ) , " Oh , how lovely ! Do come here . Darling , precious , come here ! There , you see ? I feel like squatting down on my heels , putting my arms round my knees like this , tight ? as tight as can be ? and flying away ! " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensuality . " It was a permanent equation for him . " I love you very much , Tanya , I know that you , like Sonya , love to be loved , " be added his greeting at the close of Sonya 's first postnuptial letter to her sister ; he continued to delight in teasing Tanya , flirting and kidding around with her ; and many years later , having decided that sensuality was bad , he still singled her out at family gatherings but no longer for fun and games ; he had by now suppressed in himself the pet genius at play or master ( to her mistress ) of the revels , he made a point now of being sharp and snotty to her , " sarcastic rather than humorous " ( as her brother recollected ) : Could n't she quit kidding around ? Did n't she understand that she too would die someday ? The once impish brother-in-law , now holier-than-thou , was venting his spite on the heedless and exuberant storybook heroine he had many years ago , for the deplorably secular purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tanya ? bless her ! ? responded in character : " Me ? Die ? Oh , Lev , another of your silly jokes ! " As a matter of fact , the storybook heroine would never have been capable of such a riposte . Tolstoy makes Natasha a bit dim-witted , because he believes high animal spirits are incompatible with mind : or rather because , as early as War and Peace ( and earlier ) , lie 's suspicious , envious , and fearful of the animal in those spirits , begrudges it any connection with brains or sensibility ; makes Natasha frisky ( " full of life " ) , flighty , not passionate but sexually irresponsible ; in the epilogue settles her hash by dropping her like a lump into the immemorial household grind for good and all ( hence good and safe at last , since what vile seducer would bother with this monotonously gravid slattern ? ) . The real thing had to be elsewhere . Even in his incomparably braver and riskier characterization of Anna Karenina , the author ( and soon-tobe saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worldly , passionate woman who is passionately in love with her lover would react to their first sex act " with disgust and horror , " with " shame ... at her spiritual 7 nakedness . " But this is n't our Anna , it 's the pits , the elemental funk , the old killjoy whose name is Legion . So Tolstoy was a " saint " years and years before he took to telling Tanya off at family parties . He was besides , whenever the mood came over him , to the very last a great critic as well as a great novelist . Green quotes Tolstoy 's late-in-life comment on one of Flaubert 's Three Tales , " The Legend of St. Julian Hospitaler , " whose saintly hero lies down in naked embrace body to body and mouth to mouth with a leper suffering from the mortal stages and grossest lesions of the disease : " the author himself , " says Tolstoy , unimpressed by the odor of sanctity , " would not have done and would not even have wished to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it and do not experience any agitation at reading of this amazing exploit . " ( True , the leper proves to be " Our Lord Jesus Christ " and rewards Julian by carrying him straight up to Heaven ; but how many of us would have had the luck to choose the right leper ? ) Tolstoy the cool and wary old critic ca n't be fooled by Flaubert 's false naivet ? . Furthermore the spry old novelist , always ready to learn new tricks , might well have been thinking about that " amazing " image of Flaubert 's when he improved on it and made it work in " Master and Man " : the crass and loveless master , for the first time in his life and at his final conscious moment , has an impulse of charity ? which with instant conviction he identifies as ( at last ! ) " the real thing " ? just in time to sacrifice his life for the sake of another 's by covering his servant 's body with his own ( both bodies , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , are themselves covered with winter clothing that turns out to be inadequate for the huge snowstorm that has stranded them out in the murderous cold together ) . But there 's also Green 's Tolstoy , the saintly old killjoy who decades earlier , denying Anna Karenina her likely and proper pleasure , was being as perverse and insincere as Flaubert : Anna 's " disgust and horror " are n't what Anna would ever feel with Vronsky ; they 're not squarely in the novel at all , they 're what Tolstoy or Flaubert old or young would have felt if he had ever found himself lying bareass naked body to body and mouth to mouth with St. Julian 's favorite leper . F LAUBERT and Tolstoy are Europeans , they share the same revulsions . West is West but East is different . Or at least Gandhi is different . Green is so set on certifying Tolstoy and Gandhi as universal saints in a spiritual father-son succession that he ignores obvious and intractable differences , one of which is that it is n't strange or wild to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Julian does ( Gandhi did actually administer daily massages to a leper in his ashram ) ? perhaps because Gandhi is more of a saint than Tolstoy , perhaps because ( as he himself would have argued with religious and patriotic pride ) Hinduism and India predisposed him to have less intense and less personal feelings than Tolstoy 's about passion and sex , disease and death . " Throw off personality from life , " old Tolstoy observed in his journal , " renounce it , and then HARPER'S/JULY 1983 62 there will remain that which makes the essence of life ? love " ; but for Tolstoy this was much more easily said than done . Tolstoy 's late articles of faith seem to go against the grain of his nature ; whereas Gandhi ? at any rate by comparison ? seems to have had an easy time reconciling his beliefs with his nature , or with his notions of what human nature ought to be . Green harps away on the theme of their solidarity and kinship : they " defy empires " ; their enemies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green 's absurdly expansible category of " imperialism " ( or " the modern system " ) , which lists Britain and Russia , modern technology ( " Machinery , " wrote Gandhi , " represents a great sin " ) , " the imperialism of women " ( erotic love ; home ; children ; creature comforts : whatever is promised and sometimes delivered by Green 's " land of eros . that thicket of lilacs , nightingales , and moonlight " ) , and anything else that he ( and they ) disapprove of . Gandhi was a " Tolstoyan " ; his first ashram he named " Tolstoy Farm " ; the two of them exchanged letters during Tolstoy 's last years and agreed on almost all issues ; except that Tolstoy concluded sorrowfully that Gandhi 's " Hindu nationalism spoils everything . " If Gandhi had known Tolstoy the man rather than Tolstoy the polemicist , he on the other hand might have concluded that it was Tolstoy 's irrepressible Western personality that spoiled everything . Green concedes that Tolstoy differed from Gandhi in having a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolkonsky a harsh and autocratic character in War and Peace side " ( his Western-personality side ? ) when he dealt with ideas he disliked ; but then , according to Green , he made up for it by sharing with Gandhi the quality of " lightness " ( presumably un-Voltairean ) , " a certain kind of gaiety " deriving from their " discovery of the world 's unreality " : to discover that the world is not fully real , that the injustice , the ugliness , the malevolence , the imperialist aggression and the wars HARPER'S/JULY 1983 are all the misbehavior of trivial personalities who have never found out what they want or who they are ? to rediscover this , at recurrent moments in the long anxiety or an- 4 , guish of involuntary involvement ? can be an alleviation and a breathing space . Such lightness is a good in itself . " But , " says Green , raising an ominous forefinger , " such lightness of heart is unprocurable except by means of the acceptance of death . " For Green 's Tolstoy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority equal but opposite to the authority most of us acknowledge in youth and life . Tolstoy and Gandhi offer us the possibility of a cult of age and death . " ( Thanks . ) When Tolstoy 's daughter Masha died , Tolstoy " declared that he did not feel unhappy . He met the village fool Kinya , and asked him : You have heard of our grief ? ' Kinya answered ' I heard , ' but then immediately said : ' Give me a kopek . ' Tolstoy commented : ' How much better and lighter that is ! ' " But , as Gandhi certainly did n't and as Green omits to tell us , Tolstoy wept listening to music : Green 's " erotic-melancholic marshland , " ( So did Lenin , who cursed his weakness and got on with the job of building a rational and perfect political community . Europeans . ) It 's onward and upward with age and death as Green keeps lightheartedly soaring beyond the reach of fact and history ; because ( to begin with ) Tolstoy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never brusque , he always asserted the authority of youth and life against the authoritarianism of aging and death , into his eighties he was light and gay with life and youthful high ( animal ) spirits and let light and air in everywhere , he joked about power as if after all it were only human ( Why did the British Navy execute one of its admirals ? " In order to encourage the others " ) . Against " the world 's unrealities " that Green 's saints did n't find " fully real " ? injustice , ugliness , malevolence , imperialist aggression , war , and the misbehavior of trivial personalities ? Voltaire , who did find them fully 64 B UT it is n't . It 's the Homeric account of a tribal chieftain in the Caucasus of To ! stay 's youth ; Tolstoy 's greatest work and one of the glories of Western fiction ; the greatest Western ever written , about a superb , fearless , dauntless , chivalrous warrior-horseman whose life is bounded by ruling his people and killing his enemies till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its single flaw is a " Voltairean " ( as Green would label it ) passage in which Tolstoy expresses and justifies his loathing of the tsar who reigned at the time of the story 's events ( which are historical ) ; but Tolstoy more than compensates for it by offering us as an altogether unanticipated treat his loveliest and most likable women characters , especially the beautiful , loving , worldly , witty , tactful , considerate , happy ( " smiling the radiant smile of a happy woman " ) wife of the Russian colonel , a lady whom , to our relief , though she 's beautiful , loving , worldly , etc. and passionately in love ( with her husband , thank God ! ) , he does n't punish and do away with as he does Anna Karenina . ( Tolstoy 's one other nearly unflawed masterpiece , written half a century earlier , is The Cossacks , which also concerns a tribe of noble warrior-horsemen and has his only other unpunished beautiful , lovable , likable heroine . ) Writing such a book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even a Tolstoyan ; his generosity in it toward men and women who would n't have had a flicker of interest in nonattachment , nonviolence , celibacy , or vegetarianism is a testimony to the unregenerate human being who somehow all those years survived somewhere inside the saint . For readers of fiction rather than leaders or followers , Hadji Murad is more of a resurrection than anything in Tolstoy 's grimly doctrinaire Tolstoyan novel , Resurrection . The old man kept kicking and screaming in favor of passivity and renunciation , denounced and reviled his own age of electricity and steam ( Chekhov and Tolstoy loved and admired each other , but the young doctor eventually grew impatient HARPER'S/JULY 1983 with the old saint : " there is greater love for man in electricity and steam , " wrote Chekhov , " than in continence and abstention from meat " ) . To the end , however , Tolstoy was a backslider , writing Hadji Murad , weeping helplessly over music , bursting into tears of imperialist misery when he learned of the destruction of the Russian fleet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our childish dreams , good-humored , fatherly , brimming with earnest advice , unintimidated by troubled waters even if he could n't quite walk on them . Tolstoy 's vows look like the usual Western guilt-pangs after a life of not terribly exciting sins ; but why such emphasis by mild-mannered Gandhi on the vow of celibacy ? One of his earliest disciples , interviewed in old age by Ved Mehta , accepted it in youth at Gandhi 's insistence and lived by it for the remainder of his life , but " I have to admit that I myself often felt torn ... because part of me believes that sex is an appetite , like eating , that should not be denied " ( he ought to have specified which part ) . One of Gandhi 's granddaughters , who spent her childhood at his Sevagram ashram , told Mehta that the ashram was " like Peyton Place " ; it appears then that , in a place where only those lived who had formally and voluntarily accepted all the Gandhian tenets , the vow functioned less as a proscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's grant it 's not necessary ( because not possible ) for the followers ; is it necessary for the leaders ? There 's recent evidence to the contrary . If J. Edgar Hoover and the very raw FBI wiretaps on Martin Luther King , Jr. , were correct , they showed that one need n't be celibate or even monogamous to lead a consequential and King-size political movement of passive resistance and civil disobedience under religious auspices . " Whatever turns you on , " as the swingers say ; and if what turns you off is what turns you on , your name may well be Mohandas K. Gandhi . But why all the prying into other people 's privacies ? why be a world-class spoil sport just because you yourself have sworn off Kentucky Fried Chicken ? Apparently the mysterious East again , Mother India of karma , dharma , and the purifying transmigration of souls ( Gandhi said that " for him , as a Hindu , sexual desire represented the source of all base and selfish human impulses " ) ; something about the doomful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't much to bank on , but which Christian charity would have to acknowledge is at least less vindictive than , say , Dante 's Christian Inferno for sodomites and software salesmen and six-day bicycle racers . It 's a question whether we need all the saints we get ; in any case it 's a pity that they come with the full complement of the stigmata of sainthood . They cast a cold eye on Orwell 's goal of a full acceptance of earthly life ; they attract cranks , fanatics , apostles , hypocrites , followers , camp followers ; they become one-issue candidates , prompters of all-too-moral minorities . The rest of us are never comfortable with them while they live , and when they die we revenge ourselves by turning them into plaster saints , heroes of sentimental legends like St. Julian 's , stars of stage and screen , political icons borne aloft in the latest parade . Tolstoy for Tsar or First Secretary of the Party ! Gandhi for Prime Minister of a united India ! Both of them , even if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too intelligent about themselves to aspire to such offices ? which is not to say that , politics being of course crude and stupid , they were too intelligent to have anything to do with political leadership . Great political leaders are not only as intelligent as saints , they 're less likely to attract flunkeys and timeservers ; they have qualities ? moral qualities too ? that saints lack : such leaders as Washington or Lincoln , or Garibaldi , or Holland 's William the Silent . But we still ca n't quite shake off our superstitious reverence or yearning for metaphysical trappings and claptrap , and the mean little taboos that go along with them .
