The deaths in April of legendary commander Salvador Cayetano Carpio of the Popular Liberation Forces ( FPL ) , and his chief lieutenant , Melinda Anaya Montes , severely shook the rebels - but they have determined they will not allow the loss to hinder their war against the Salvadorean government. // Some rebels say the net result of changed FPL leadership may even be positive . They suggest new FPL leadership may spur new unity among the five factions that make up the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) , the umbrella group of Salvadorean guerrillas. // There never have been strong , supportive relations among the five guerrilla groups . The first major joint effort of FMLN members - the so-called ' ' final offensive ' ' against government troops in January 1981 - was a failure . Unity then , as now , was strained . Even today the factions maintain separate military and political structures. // A key dispute within the FMLN has been whether to negotiate with the Salvadorean government . Rebel spokesman Ruben Zamora is scheduled to be in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zamora has said that the rebels are willing to negotiate . But in the past the issue of negotiations has split the guerrillas. // The FPL and Carpio had looked on talks as principally a tactic within the war effort . But the People ' s Revolutionary Army ( ERP ) - the largest group after the FPL - and the other three rebel organizations view negotiation as part of a political solution to the conflict. // The FPL had favored the ' ' prolonged popular war . ' ' Members would fight a long war of attrition instead of seeking quick victory or alliances to impel a political victory . In contrast , ERP advocated an ' ' insurrectional ' ' strategy or general strikes leading up to a final offensive and a mass insurrection. // The ERP plan was basically a blueprint of Nicaragua ' s revolt in 1979 . But the January 1981 attempt to carry it out in a final offensive did not work in El Salvador . There was no general uprising and the movement ' s urban organizations were exposed , forcing many Salvadorean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces. // However , shortly before Carpio and Anaya Montes died , the FPL appears to have made a major tactical shift . At a January meeting , the FPL high command decided it would make greater efforts to work with the other Salvadorean guerrilla organizations . Previously , it had functioned more or less as an opposition group within the FMLN , refusing to compromise on many issues. // This tactical shift reportedly triggered the chain of events that led to the murder of Anaya Montes and Carpio ' s suicide. // The circumstances , as described by political exiles in Nicaragua , are these : Miss Anaya Montes , second in command of the group , was murdered April 6 in Managua . FPL commander Carpio committed suicide shortly after discovering that Anaya Montes had been killed by one of Carpio ' s own proteges . Some rebels say the killer is Rogelio Bazzaglio , the No. 3 man in Carpio ' s command structure. // Anaya Montes had been a key advocate of closer relations with the other groups . Carpio went along with this change , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s position as leader was threatened by the changes . But he apparently never suspected a top lieutenant would commit murder in opposition to the changes . An FPL member calls Carpio ' s suicide ' ' his ultimate repudiation of the crime ( the Anaya Montes murder ) . ' ' // Some say that had Carpio lived , he would have reaped some political benefits from the changes and from the loss of Anaya Montes . But this might have incurred high costs as well , namely suspicion and mistrust in the rebel movement , since many would never have believed that Carpio had nothing to do with the murder. // Carpio founded the FPL in 1970 . He had resigned as secretary-general of the Communist Party of El Salvador , disenchanted about the prospects that union organizing and electoral politics could ever end the 40-year chain of military dictators . The group successfully attracted many peasant unions and radical Christian groups into its ranks. // A personality cult grew up around Carpio , which he is said to have cultivated . Nicknamed the Ho Chi Minh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members thought Carpio should be the FMLN commander in chief . Believing that the FPL was the leader of the Salvadorean revolutionary movement , they also thought the other rebel groups should swing around to their views. // But the FPL may in a sense have swung a little toward the others . Today FMLN guerrillas say they plan to focus their efforts on building rebel forces in the heart of El Salvador . They advocate negotiations with the Salvadorean government , although they are not expecting them to take place. // ' ' A dialogue with the government could lead to negotiations , ' ' said an editor of Guazapa , a newspaper associated with the National Resistance ( RN ) , another FMLN group . But elections ' ' offer no solution , ' ' he said . Asked what the parties could talk about in negotiations , the editor said , ' ' conditions for real democracy , ending of censorship , a cleanup in the military , and justice for the crimes of the death squads . . . . There is a consensus in El Salvador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate labor unions , and part of the Christian Democratic Party are already in agreement , he said. // ' ' Right now there is no way to participate in the elections , the people don ' t have channels of communication . They can not meet or mobilize , it is absurd and impossible with the repression. ' ' // The rebels dismiss the government ' s amnesty plan as well . An ERP member said , ' ' Amnesty was decreed on other occasions and the results are revealing - few were favored , few took advantage of it , and no lives were secure . ' ' He said that some of those who were to have been protected by the amnesty have been found dead , their bodies mutilated. // The previous aricle was published June 2. // //
