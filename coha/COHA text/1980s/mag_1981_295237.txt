As Reagan and Congress ponder their moves , the gloom grows <P> The uproar over Budget Boss David Stockman 's indiscreet remarks could scarcely have come at a worse moment for the Reagan Administration . Time has just about run out for Congress and the White House to make tough economic choices . The legislators have until the end of this week , Nov. 20 , to appropriate money to keep the Government running , and the President will have to decide whether to veto bills that pierce his budget ceilings . Worse , the decisions will be made in an atmosphere of confusion , worry and even gloom created by the deepening recession that had called the Administration 's policy into question even before Stockman sowed further doubts . <P> The slide does seem to be bringing down inflation and interest rates . But whether the gains will be permanent or only temporary is subject to sharp dispute . In any case , they are coming at a price much higher than the Administration had expected the nation to pay .

The Administration and many private forecasters are expecting a further increase to 8.5% or 9% . The latter figure would equal the rate at the end of the 1973-75 recession ; that was the worst jobless rate since 1941 . <P> The current slump began in housing and autos , two sectors of the economy peculiarly sensitive to high interest rates .

Retailers suffered a sharp 1.5% drop in sales last month ; many are anticipating lackluster business in their all-important Christmas season . The electronics firms of northern California 's " Silicon Valley , " which make microchip components for computers , have for years been riding a heady boom , but now their profits are plummeting . Employment and spending by state and local governments kept a sturdy prop under the national economy during many previous recessions , but now they too are falling , in part because Reagan 's budget cuts have reduced the flow of federal cash .
