The issue , raised in a bankruptcy settlement plan by the company , sets up an unprecedented contest over whether a regulated utility can be removed from state control , over the objections of state regulators. // Judge James E. Yacos of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manchester , N.H. , will resume hearings in the case today and may order separate hearings on the question of regulation . <> <> Rate Rise Could Be 40% // The stakes are high . If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission were given jurisdiction over Public Service , the utility ' s rates could instantly increase by 30 percent to 40 percent . The shift in regulation would evade a 1978 state law barring the utility from collecting money from customers to pay for its $2. 1 billion investment in the Seabrook nuclear plant , the project stalled by a dispute over emergency planning that has pushed Public Service into Chapter 11 bankruptcy . In contrast with the state law , which allows utilities to collect from customers only after a plant goes into service , Federal regulators allow utilities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under construction. // The Federal Government regulates wholesale electric transactions . Public Service is proposing to split itself into a generation and transmission company and a retail company . The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would then set the price at which the generation and transmission company sold its power to the retail company . That price largely determines the price paid by consumers. // New Hampshire argues that the United States Supreme Court recognizes utility rate regulation as the prerogative of the states . Regulating electric rates " represents the exercise of fundamental police powers , " said Larry M. Smuckler , an Assistant Attorney General who represents the state . The rate increases sought by the company , he said , would mean that " instead of a bankrupt utility , we will have a bankrupt state economy. " // But Public Service argues that Federal regulation is needed to take the utility and Seabrook out of New Hampshire politics , in which it has been a centerpiece for years . The company also argues that most other electricity customers in New Hampshire are already using power regulated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire ' s approval would be required for Public Service to reorganize into wholesale and retail companies . But Public Service said in a Feb. 1 motion that under bankruptcy law the authority of the bankruptcy judge pre-empts the usual power of the state . <> <> Possibility of Settlement // Judge Yacos has raised the possibility that secured and unsecured creditors , shareholders and the state will reach a settlement under which the issue of who would regulate would be moot . But in considering a second issue , whether parties other than Public Service should be allowed to propose settlement plans , several witnesses have said the state , the stockholders and the debt holders are far from agreement. // On Friday , Charles E. Bayless , senior president and chief financial officer of Public Service , said in testimony that the company was now considering a plan under which rates would rise 10 percent for three years in a row , but the company would remain under state regulation . In earlier negotiations , he said , the state left the impression that such rate increases were acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning smaller resources would be available to pay debt holders. // While Public Service threatens to seek Federal regulation , the New Hampshire Legislature is considering a bill to take over Public Service . The legislation was introduced when negotiations with the company broke down in December. // Another point of contention in the case is the assertion by Public Service that the state has no authority to set rates during the bankruptcy . Judge Yacos has not ruled on the argument , but earlier this month he issued a temporary injunction blocking the state Public Utilities Commission from continuing a hearing aimed at cutting electric rates . Because of increased sales , Public Service has been earning 16. 67 percent on its equity , compared with an authorized rate of return of 14. 94 percent. // The question of who will set rates for Public Service is crucial to the bankruptcy proceedings because the rates charged determine the value of the company. // " The function of a bankruptcy proceeding is to divide the pie , " said Wilbur Ross , an investment banker with Rothschild Inc. who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make the pie to divide it. " // Testimony at hearings last week in the case indicated that the parties can not even agree on a uniform method for translating a given projection of rate levels for coming years into a value for the company . <> <> Value of Company Uncertain // As a result , the value of the company is uncertain . Mr. Ross put it roughly at between $1. 5 billion and $3 billion . Others put the upper limit slightly lower. // Adding to the uncertainty , the parties in the bankruptcy proceedings are concerned that raising rates beyond a certain point may not increase revenues , because it will scare off large customers . Different parties have projected different price levels at which the demand for electricity would begin to fall off . Should that occur , utility analysts said , rates for remaining customers would have to rise again , as fixed costs were spread over smaller sales . Those rate increases could accelerate the process. // Another question is the future of Seabrook , a completed but unused reactor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said the plant is mechanically ready to begin low-power testing . But because of the poor financial health of Public Service , which owns 35. 6 percent of the plant and actually built most of it , the commission insists that the owners - a consortium of New England utilities - first set aside $72. 1 million , which would be used to clean up the radiation that low-power testing would produce , if testing was not followed by a full-power license. // Full operation is in doubt because Massachusetts has refused to submit emergency plans for the six towns within 10 miles of the plant . The owners have developed an evacuation plan , which has been tested and must now be considered in a lengthy hearing convened by the commission. // If the plant operates , Public Service could apply to charge customers for its investment in the plant , probably ending the company ' s bankruptcy . <> <> Alternate Plans Possible // With the parties having made little progress over the past year , Judge Yacos is now preparing to consider whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . Public Service said alternate proposals would delay a settlement . But the company , its creditors and the state seem to be at an impasse , and Judge Yacos said last week that " it seems to be a passive assumption , if not an outright admission by the debtor , that they are not going to proceed with this particular plan. " // As the bankruptcy proceedings drag on , they are being played out on an increasingly public stage . Northeast Utilities , which a few weeks ago bid $2 billion for Public Service , less its share in Seabrook , has begun an advertising campaign here to build public support . Northeast , which is based in Berlin , Conn. , and is New England ' s largest utility , is not alone . The New England Electric System , which also plans to bid for Public Service , has begun a similar campaign. // Public Service , meanwhile , has begun asking its employees what they think of Seabrook , the possibility the company would be broken up or sold , and the bankruptcy itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsletter . As one employee put it : " We ' re not at a fork in the road . We ' re in a rotary. " //
