Author Joy Adamson lived free amid her animals <P> Only one thing is certain , " wrote Joy Adamson in her autobiography , published just last spring . " People get out of life exactly what they put into it . " Joy Adamson embraced East Africa and shared her embrace with the world . During more than four decades in Kenya , she sketched and painted the region 's luxuriant flowers and plants , captured portraits of its tribespeople in their fast-vanishing traditional costumes , and-most of all-made the great cats of Africa her friends . No lion on earth ever became more famous than Elsa , the cub that Adamson reared from infancy and then painstakingly trained to return to the wild . Through her book Born Free , its sequels and the film , Adamson made her lioness as popular and familiar as Lassie . Feeding the tiny cub with a baby bottle , pushing her on a homemade swing , nuzzling her with fearless affection , Adamson seemed more mother than keeper . <P> She was born Joy-Friederike Victoria Gessner in Troppau , Silesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before World War I. Even then , on the family estate , she would often accompany the resident gamekeeper through thickets filled with deer and foxes . She went on to study widely-music , dressmaking , metal crafts and premedical subjects-and in 1935 was married to an Austrian businessman . But two years later she went off on vacation to Kenya where , she recalled later , she " fell in love with this wonderful country , " and stayed . A second marriage , to Botanist Peter Bally , foundered in 1944 on safari , when Joy met a British-Irish game warden named George Adamson . They were married later that same year . <P> Childless themselves , the Adamsons fashioned a wilderness family out of Kenya 's foundling animals . In 1956 , after George had shot a ferocious lioness , the couple rescued her just-born litter . The two stronger females in time went off to a Dutch zoo . Elsa , the weakest , stayed behind to become first a pet ( she rode on their Land Rover roof , often slept in George 's tent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roamed briefly with a pride of wild lions , the Adamsons determined to release her and let her return to freedom . In preparation for that , with seemingly endless patience , they taught Elsa to hunt and kill for food . <P> Elsa and the three cubs she mothered were only the Adamsons ' first experiments in returning animals to the wild . George continued to work mostly with lions , including some who had performed in Born Free . But Joy turned in the 1960s to cheetahs , successfully de-taming an engaging creature named Pippa and launching another three books . In recent years , while plowing book and movie profits into an international conservation project called the Elsa Wild Animal Appeal , she also turned her attention to rehabilitating leopards for the wild , a project that she was on the way to completing as she approached her 70th birthday later this month .
