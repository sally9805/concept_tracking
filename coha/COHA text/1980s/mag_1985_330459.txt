In his dogfight for TWA , Investor Carl Icahn has learned that if it is n't one thing , it 's another . Last week he finally won control of the fifth-largest U.S. air carrier by buying the last chunks of stock necessary for a 50.3% share of the company . Yet Icahn 's victory means that the raider will now be held hostage by a number of unusual problems arising from the June hijacking of TWA Flight 847 . <P> To date , the hijacking has cost TWA about $20 million . But it will not end there . The airline 's insurance company , Associated Aviation Underwriters , is offering the 143 passengers flat payments ranging from $10,000 to $35,000 . But international agreements entitle people on hijacked flights normally to collect awards of up to $75,000 . So far , about half the passengers have accepted the offers . <P> At least six former hostages , though , are suing TWA . One couple claims TWA was negligent in not providing proper security at Athens airport , where the hijacking began . Violette Darras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victim of grief , torment , terror and " loss of companionship " because her husband William was taken hostage . <P> TWA will have no such problem with Uli Derickson 's oil credit-card purchase . At a stop in Algiers , the plane needed fuel , but ground crews would not start pumping unless they were paid . Derickson , a flight attendant aboard the plane , reached for her purse , pulled out her Shell plastic , and bought 6,000 gal . of aviation kerosene . Shell does not expect payment . <P> The most publicized and photographed hostage of them all , the Boeing 727 plane , last week was finally flown back from Beirut to TWA 's base in Kansas City . There the grimy craft underwent a nostalgic examination by John Testrake , the pilot during the hijacking . Before the aircraft was allowed to take off , though , Beirut airport officials demanded that TWA pay one final bill : landing fees for the three times the plane touched down in Beirut , and other charges for 67 days of parking .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
