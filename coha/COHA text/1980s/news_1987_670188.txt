LOUISVILLE , Ky.  --  In the business of health care , Humana Inc. seemed to be blazing the trail to the future . The operator of 85 for-profit hospitals , Humana a couple of years ago was rapidly building a health-insurance plan as well , along with a national network of doctors ' offices . Citing changes in medical economics , its chief executive , David Jones , was bent on fashioning nothing less than a health-care conglomerate . Other chains of investor-owned hospitals , more cautiously , were moving in the same direction  --  toward the kind of integrated company that industry jargon labeled a " supermed . " The future looks rather different now . Humana ' s network of doctors ' offices , having never turned a profit , has been disbanded . And its insurance plan , stung by heavy losses , has dropped out of about half the geographical markets in which it once did business . Mr. Jones " just took everything on at once , and it was a hell of a ride , " says Randolph Brown , former head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s sorting through the pieces . " The experience has been sobering not just for Humana but also for its competitors in the investor-owned segment of the hospital business , which controls about 12% of U.S. hospitals . Now the chains are struggling anew to figure out how best to deal with the social and economic trend that set Humana off on its rocky course . That trend is a resolve by businesses and government to curb medical costs . The problem for hospital chains , of course , is that a central part of this frugality drive is an effort to keep people out of hospitals . Humana tried to defend itself through diversification , as did the other large chains , Hospital Corp. of America , American Medical International Inc. and National Medical Enterprises Inc . The idea was that if a hospital owner also had an insurance plan , it could steer patients to its institutions through financial incentives . The patient pool might shrink , but the company could grab a bigger part of it . At the same time , other new ventures , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in effect following the business that was leaving hospitals . All of the new health services might be brought together under the insurance plan and sold as a cut-rate package to employers . " There was a time in the early ' 80s when these guys were saying , ' We ' re going to operate everything , including funeral parlors , ' " says Uwe Reinhardt , a health-care economist at Princeton University . No other hospital owner ran so hard along this path as Humana . Its insurance plan , Humana Care Plus , signed up 616 , 000 people within three years . Its Humana MedFirst network of doctors ' offices hung out its first shingle in 1981 and soon grew to include 168 offices . But in fiscal 1986 , write-offs related to the doctors ' offices and the insurance plan totaled over $109 million . What went wrong ? Plenty , Humana acknowledges . In its rush to dominate fields it was new to , it discovered only belatedly that some of its maneuvers were having nearly opposite the intended results . Care Plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more admissions to rival institutions than to its own . MedFirst , though meant to strengthen ties with doctors , created resentment . Many physicians outside the new network  --  people on whom Humana hospitals also relied for patients  --  saw the doctors ' offices as an encroachment . Mr. Jones , who is Humana ' s chairman as well as CEO , says these problems boil down to mistakes in execution , not in strategy . Though forced to retrench , he has signaled , through the recent acquisition of an ailing insurance plan in Florida , that the company remains committed to diversification . Mr. Brown , the former head of MedFirst , says Mr. Jones " may win this thing yet . " The other chains , however , have had enough . Hospital Corp. of America has ended its main foray into insurance ( it still has a passive interest in an insurer ) , and last month it sold 104 of its hospitals to focus on running the other 132 more proficiently . American Medical and National Medical also have largely abandoned their insurance ventures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t going to be any ' supermed , ' " says Thomas F. Frist Jr . , Hospital Corp. ' s chief executive . At Humana , rapid expansion was always the watchword . The company is the outgrowth of a single nursing home that Mr. Jones and Wendell Cherry , Humana ' s president , opened in 1962 . Within a decade the concern was out of nursing homes , into hospitals , on the acquisition trail . It became known for tight controls of hospital purchasing and staffing . ( " Humama , " one doctor calls it ) . All the while , it rode the wave of rising U.S. spending on medical care , and its stock price soared . Then the hospital industry was shaken . The watershed event was the move by the federal Medicare program , starting in 1983 , to pay hospitals fixed fees according to diagnostic categories ; the government previously covered all of a hospital ' s outlays for treating Medicare patients . Reimbursement from employers and their insurers also tightened as they raised deductibles and began to monitor doctors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance plans as health-maintenance organizations put further pressure on hospital occupancy rates and income . Humana , sensing radical change in hospital use , began to pare its hospital chain and swiftly branched out into other health-care businesses . In Humana Care Plus , it created an insurance plan that could appeal to employers with relatively low premiums . After they bought , their employees who needed hospitalization had incentives to choose Humana : If they didn ' t , the deductible would be higher and the insurer would pay a smaller percentage of the rest of the bill , except with emergencies . The problem was that doctors still make most of the decisions about which hospital a patient goes to , and the plan contained little to influence them . By and large , doctors were loath to change their ways and start admitting to different hospitals . Mr. Jones says some doctors simply reported admissions to non-Humana hospitals as emergencies , protecting patients from financial penalty . And some hospitals outside the Humana chain fought back . In Las Vegas , the site of the giant 679-bed Humana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humana ' s incentives . Valley has accused Care Plus of retaliating by delaying payments of Valley ' s bills , an accusation Humana denies . Humana was slow to realize that Care Plus was misfiring . Bills from its own hospitals , sent electronically as soon as services were rendered , tended to accumulate earlier than bills from other hospitals , giving a false picture of the share of Care Plus admissions that Humana hospitals were capturing . In fact , as of early 1986 only 47% of Care Plus admissions across the U.S. were ending up in Humana hospitals , far below the 75% expected . At Humana MedFirst , too , there were rude surprises . It built the offices and contracted with physician-administrators to hire doctors and run them . The offices were expected to operate profitably . As start-up costs and other glitches kept them in the red , Humana began to put more of the doctors ' offices near Humana hospitals . If they weren ' t profitable , at least they could steer patients Humana ' s way . But then the Humana hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain as a threat to their practices . Some doctors were incensed that this competitor had been set up by a company that wanted them to send their patients to its hospitals . In San Antonio , Texas , a group of physicians took out newspaper ads purporting to show high X-ray and lab charges at a Humana hospital . In Greensboro , N.C. , a doctor quit as chief of medicine at a Humana hospital in protest . And in Louisville , an important market for Humana as well as its headquarters city , doctors threatening a spat dissuaded Humana from opening any MedFirst offices at all . " Humana never realized there would be this kind of resistance , " says Stuart Cohen , a family doctor in Louisville . " They thought we would be patsies . " Some administrators of Humana hospitals turned cool to MedFirst doctors ' offices , concerned that other physicians might begin to boycott their institutions . " The hospitals hated us , " says Savas Mallos , a former Humana executive who was the director of operations for MedFirst . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got from our administrators . " Humana began its disposal of MedFirst offices last year and completed it in August . It still owns a few of them but no longer uses the MedFirst name . Meanwhile , hospital occupancy has continued to slip , at Humana as elsewhere . Its rate has fallen to 47% from 61% in 1981 . Although profit margins at Humana hositals remain high by industry standards , they have eroded somewhat . For the nine months ended May 31 , corporate earnings fell 17% to $135. 4 million , or $1. 38 a share , on revenue of $2. 93 billion . And Humana stock has lost its glamour . It closed yesterday at $25. 50 a share . As Mr. Jones sees it , the continuing pressure on occupancy rates shows Humana is right in trying to get the kinks out of its diversification strategy rather than giving up on it . " I think we ' re going to be one of the big winners , " he says . The insurance plan is helping hospital occupancy more now than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely because the insurance plan has written tougher terms . Under contracts reached with 6 , 000 doctors so far , when a person insured by the plan needs hospitalization , a Humana hospital has to be used in most cases . Mr. Jones has Humana looking into what else the insurance venture ( which is gradually changing its name to Humana Health Care Plans ) might do . One possibility is to try to exact volume discounts from suppliers of things like drugs and eyeglasses . And Humana has just taken a big gamble in Florida . It is trying to revive International Medical Centers Inc. , an HMO it acquired in June for $40 million and a commitment to infuse it with $20 million . IMC ' s 140 , 000 members replenish insurance rolls that had fallen back as Humana let policies expire in weak markets . And IMC is in a state where Humana has 18 hospitals . But its contribution remains to be seen , for IMC has big problems . It had contracted with the federal government to cover Medicare patients . The government paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fixed fee in advance for most of the care members might need . But IMC didn ' t make the money stretch far enough , and last year it had an $18. 4 million loss . It was in state receivership when Humana bought it . According to federal regulators , mismanagement compounded the trouble . A federal indictment this year charged former IMC President Miguel E. Recarey Jr. with conspiracy and bribery in connection with an attempt to win a contract from a labor union . He has pleaded innocent . Regulators say Humana has moved energetically to right things , installing new management , creating a team of nurses to monitor the quality of care and working to attract non-Medicare members . In other markets , too , the company has stepped up its sales efforts . Mr. Jones says that Humana has corrected its errors and that in the long run its strategy for dealing with the national effort to curb medical bills will work out . Still , he concedes , " We don ' t know what ' s out there to bite us next. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industry Leaders Hospital Corp. of America : Number of beds 17 , 931 Latest annual net income ( in millions of dollars ) $174. 6 Humana : Number of beds 17 , 279 Latest annual net income ( in millions of dollars ) $54. 5 National Med .
