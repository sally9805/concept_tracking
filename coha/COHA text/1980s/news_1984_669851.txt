PHILADELPHIA  --  Walter Mondale rolled to a smashing victory in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary , capturing about 46% of the vote . Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado finished second , with the Rev. Jesse Jackson third in this industrial state , where the two had attempted to slow the momentum of Mr. Mondale ' s victory a week ago in New York . This was the vote , with 62% of the state ' s precincts reporting : - Mr . Mondale 46%. - Sen . Hart 34%. - Mr . Jackson 20% . Indications were that Mr. Mondale would win more than 110 of the 117 democratic convention delegates at stake yesterday , in contrast to a handful for Mr. Hart . Mr. Mondale already leads Sen. Hart by more than 400 delegate votes . Mr. Mondale described yesterday ' s victory as a " very strong win . " He said : " I ' m encouraged to believe that what I have been saying about where I want to take the country , the differences as the public perceives them , is helping me gain the momentum toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Mr. Mondale ' s labor support would hurt the former vice president as the primary campaign moved into the Western states . " Those states are much more favorable to us , " he said . The surprising dimensions of Mr. Mondale ' s Pennsylvania triumph will make Sen. Hart ' s uphill fight even more difficult . Sen. Hart campaigned hard in Pennsylvania , with considerable expectations , but the only voter group he carried against Mr. Mondale was Democrats under 25 years of age . Sen. Hart now will have to rethink the themes he has been stressing , for he failed to convince Pennsylvanians he is the man to run against President Reagan this fall . NBC exit polls suggest that Pennsylvania Democrats , by a 4-to-1 margin , believed Mr. Mondale will win the nomination . Less than half of Sen. Hart ' s own voters thought he would be the nominee . That is the best kind of news for Mr. Mondale . It reinforces , once again , the idea that his nomination appears inevitable . In New England , where Sen. Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Mondale scored with all his usual constituent groups  --  except this time he did better in almost every category . NBC reported he defeated Sen. Hart 3-to-2 among white voters . He carried the over-50 vote by 2-to-1 ; Pennsylvania has a large population in that category . Union families in this heavily unionized state turned out in impressive numbers . NBC estimated almost half the voters in yesterday ' s primary belonged to union families , and Mr. Mondale ' s margin among them ran 2-to-1 . Almost from the start , Sen. Hart has been the favorite of the so-called yuppies  --  young urban professionals making more than $20 , 000 who range in age from 25 to 40 . But here in Pennsylvania , the exit polls suggested Mr. Mondale may have come close to carrying that vote . Sen. Hart also has long been the choice of voters who think of themselves as independent . He also may have lost those people in Pennsylvania . Voters in Pennsylvania were keenly interested in economic issues , especially jobs , in a state with 8. 9% unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do more to put people back to work . Sen. Hart insists that his campaign will do better as the campaign moves west and southwest ; as a Coloradan , he thinks of that as his turf . Although the campaign does move to some Western states soon , it also heads for states like Missouri , Ohio , Indiana , North Carolina , West Virginia and New Jersey , states that don ' t look very promising for Sen. Hart . Sen. Hart ' s campaign , in trouble before the big Pennsylvania vote , appears in desperate condition now . Once again , voters here said in exit poll interviews they aren ' t sure where he stands on the issues . To improve his chances , Sen. Hart will need to find some way of stating his case to the voters , and he will have to come up with an answer soon . The vote in Pennsylvania was a big disappointment for Mr. Jackson , too . He campaigned hard here , but apparently failed to do as well as he did a week ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75% of the black vote in Pennsylvania , after picking up 87% in New York . Most black politicians supported him , with the major exception of Mayor Wilson Goode of Philadelphia , who campaigned hard for Mr. Mondale . Mr. Jackson carried about 3% of the white vote .
