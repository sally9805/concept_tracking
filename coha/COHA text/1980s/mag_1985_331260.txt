The polls had not yet closed last week in Guyana when familiar cries of " fraud " rang out . As in every election in the South American country since it was granted independence from Britain in 1966 , opposition politicians and others charged that the polling and the vote count were rigged to favor the ruling People 's National Congress . Indeed , the margin of victory was improbably large , with the P.N.C. taking 76% of the vote and six opposition parties dividing the rest . The win gives the P.N.C. 42 of the 53 seats in the national legislature and allows President Hugh Desmond Hoyte , 56 , to remain in office for five more years . <P> Hoyte has led Guyana since the death last August of Forbes Burnham , a charismatic Marxist who had eviscerated the country 's bauxite-and-sugar-base d economy . Although he was Burnham 's principal deputy for the past decade , last week the newly elected President offered his 800,000 fellow citizens some hope , promising that a revitalized economy would be his first priority . " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am not an airy-fairy socialist , that I am not bound by the dead hand of the past . "
