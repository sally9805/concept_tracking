 | There are no drugs , no jeans and not much adolescent sass at the Sheridan Road Christian School outside Saginaw , Mich . Most classes begin and end with a prayer . Students attend chapel once a week , and those who misbehave are not spared the rod . They learn , in no uncertain terms , that God created man and that history is really his story . Sheridan Road teachers believe that they were called to a special mission , and in a way so do Sheridan Road parents . " In my job I see the violence and the result of drugs in public schools , " says James Cross , a police officer and father of a senior . " I just do n't want my kids involved with that . I 'm trying to do the best I can for them , so they 'll grow up to be Christians and raise Christian kids themselves .

Some parents , like the Crosses , want a clear moral framework for their children . Others are fleeing declining academic standards and disciplinary problems in the public schools . The exodus cuts across political lines to include conservatives who oppose busing and liberals who support integration . And despite tuition that can top $6,000 a year , the applications keep coming . Some private academies have bought empty public-school buildings to teach the overflow ; all seem to be profiting from the panic ? from venerable Phillips Academy in Andover , Mass. , which turned 203 years old this year , to the Jesus Only Tabernacle , a fundamentalist school that began seven months ago in a Nashville , Tenn. , basement . Says Gerald Grant of Syracuse University : " Only private schools now have a public . " Worried public-school officials have coined a new term to define the phenomenon : bright flight .

In the South the number of students in public schools declined by 6 per cent while private enrollment increased by 31 per cent . Some educators are afraid that if the defections continue unchecked , they could erode financial and political support for public education . The NEwsWEEK Poll seems to support their fear : 54 per cent of parents with children in public school say they have considered the private alternative ; 23 per cent say they would be likely to switch to private schools if Congress approved tuition tax credits of $250 to $500 a year . James Coleman 's new study argues that minority students may have the most to gain if the government helps foot the private-school bill . And the Rev. Andrew Greeley , a sociologist and Catholic priest , made common cause with Coleman by releasing his own study showing that blacks and Hispanics perform better in Catholic schools than in public schools .

" " When you have a commitment to doing the best for your child , you want to go with the best choice , " says her mother ? a Los Angeles public-school teacher . What private schools offer that public schools do n't is control .

" Show me a private school that will accept students on a first-come , first-served basis , excluding none , and I will show you a private school that wo n't exist , " says Terry Herndon of the National Education Association . For all their advantages , private schools are not immune to the troubles that stalk the public schools . Courses are sometimes skimpy and facilities even skimpier ; many private schools have no labs or gyms . Student test scores have begun to droop in a few Southern California schools . At the Dallas Christian School in Selma , Ala. , where salaries average $8,000 , the whole staff moonlights . Dedicated teachers may not mind the heavy duties , @# NEWSWEEK/APRIL 20 , 1981 67  | but not all teachers are dedicated . Not all are certified either , and some private-school teachers would not qualify for work in the public system . Parents desperate to escape the problems of public schools must also be on the lookout for shady operators who charge for unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a richer one comes along . America 's best private schools have priced themselves out of the worst problems . Schools like Andover , Groton and Choate train the country 's elite in the prep tradition , providing top education for the top dollar . Median tuition at the secondary level for the 894 member institutions of the National Association of Independent Schools is $3,196 for day students and $6,159 for boarders . Not that money is never an object . Tuition still does n't cover all expenses and many prep schools run habitually in the red . Not long ago , they had the same drug problems as any suburban high school , and they came under further attack for not admitting enough non-white and non-rich students . But for the most part , those crises are past ; today the prep schools seem as solid and self-assured as ever . The real transformation in American private education has been in the Catholic schools . In 1965 they accounted for nearly 87 per cent of private enrollment ; by 1979 they had lost more than 2 million students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban white constituents fled the inner city ; state governments cut aid for parochial schools , and the number of lay teachers in the classroom persuaded many parents that the schools were n't all that Catholic anyway . None of that has changed , but the Catholic schools still have something to cheer about : blacks and Hispanics are moving into the classroom almost as fast as whites are moving out . At an average of $217 for elementary students and $803 for high schoolers , the education comes relatively cheap , and the worst public-school problems are kept in check . In his recent study , Andrew Greeley argues that the parochial newcomers get their money 's worth . Minority students , he says , do better academically and have fewer disciplinary problems if they go to parochial schools . Greeley concedes that blacks and Hispanics who attend Catholic schools come from smaller , better-educated , higher-income families than their public-school counterparts , advantages that might lead to better scholastic performance . Still , he told NEWSWEEK , " Something seems to be happening in the Catholic schools that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude that the Catholic schools , which were set up to help poor immigrants , now do the same for minorities . " Perhaps as a result , blacks and Hispanics are bidding to replace the Irish and Italians as a parochial-school clientele ? at least in some places . Eight years ago less than a third of Chicago 's Catholic pupils were non-white ; now more than 40 per cent are , and most of the blacks are not even Catholic . Holy Angels , the nation 's largest black Catholic school , squats amid one of Chicago 's sorriest slums . Like many others , it had fallen on hard times . But then George Clements , a black priest , became pastor of the Holy Angels parish and began to make things happen . He expanded the school year to eleven months , assigned plenty of homework and punished the students who did n't do it . He demanded just as much of their parents . They must attend Mass each Sunday even if they are n't Catholic , or their children face dismissal . NonCatholic parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . Some critics says this is asking too much ? but the school gets 1,000 more applicants a year than it can accept . Ironically , the same pressures that persuaded Catholics to establish their own schools in the nineteenth century are behind today 's Christian-fundamentalist boom . If Catholics shied away from the public system because it was too Protestant , the fundamentalists are seceding because they find it too secular . They do n't like the ban on prayer in school . They are unhappy about library books that reflect the less-than-chaste realities of contemporary society . Drugs dismay them and sex education horrifies them . " Most of the people drawn to these schools are reacting to the social and cultural changes that we 've gone through in the last fifteen years , " says sociologist Peter Skerry in explaining the new Protestant Reformation . The popularity of the fundamentalist schools inevitably begs the question of racism . In the South most of the sure-enough segregation academies were established ten or more years ago , when the Justice Department began to get serious about desegregation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only because the deed has already been done . There are a few clear signs of prejudice , however . Last month a white teen-age girl who had been expelled from Marumsco Christian School in Woodbridge , Va. , for associating with a black classmate won an $18,000 out-of-court settlement from the principal , who had told her that interracial dating was banned by Scripture . Elsewhere in the country , where desegregation foes did not have such a head start , the urge to get righteous is not so easily distinguished from the urge to get away . In Boston , half the white students have left the public schools since court-ordered integration began in 1974 . And it is no accident that Los Angeles County is home to more than half the private schools in California , many of them Christian ; court-ordered busing began there in 1978 . Another court ruling invalidated the busing plan earlier this year , however , and many students are expected back in public school next year . Nobody knows for sure just how many Christian schools there are because , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If someone wants to have a school in his backyard , he can do it , " says a state education official in Louisiana , where 400 private schools are accredited and any number of others operate without state knowledge or approval . By some estimates , there are more than 10,000 Christian-fundamentalist schools around the country , and some observers say they are currently appearing at the rate of three a day . Most are elementary schools . Some erect new buildings and landscape spacious campuses , while others do their duty with a handful of children in Sunday-school classrooms . But the smaller the quarters , the more likely parents are to participate by doing volunteer work around the school or helping to raise funds . " The one thing that really works for these schools , " says Andover headmaster Theodore Sizer , " is that the  | parents have opted in . That totally changes the transaction . " In the classroom , religion is all-pervasive . Everything from grammar to geography is taught by Biblical example , and parents more concerned with morals than SAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for the Christian part , but they are really getting a good education , " says the mother of Billy Sue Clark , a senior at Dallas Christian in Selma . Not everyone rates the schools so highly . The Accelerated Christian Education ( ACE ) curriculum used in many Christian schools is particularly quirky . Students are left on their own to learn from workbooks , with only a supervisor to oversee the results and a few monitors to handle discipline . One former teacher at a Birmingham Christian school found the ACE program baffling for students and instructors alike , dotted with errors because it was prepared so hastily and difficult for poor readers . " It was the most frustrating thing I 've ever'been associated with , " she says . A typical example of the new Christian schools is the Jesus Only Tabernacle School in Nashville . It opened last September in a building adjacent to the church and now has three instructors and 55 pupils in kindergarten through twelfth grade . The Rev. C. M. Baggett , the school principal and the preacher at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has wrought . " There has n't been no dope , there 's been no policemen out here , and there 's been no swearing or cursing , " he says . The students learn individually from the ACE curriculum . " We do n't put nothing on the blackboard , " says Baggett . " A child learns at his own speed , and if he does n't learn in our school , he wo n't learn in none of them . " Not all Christian schools fit that mold . Whittier Christian High ' in California , began in a local church 23 years ago . Now , with an enrollment of 720 , it is trying to rent a nearby junior high school ? its third public-school take-over . The Whittier campus looks like a television model of a suburban high school , @# . uF4'SWFFTc/APRTT ' 7 ! 1 IOR1  | filled with well-scrubbed , hard-working kids . " We are n't a brain factory , " says principal Frank Mercer . " Some kids have fourcylinder brains , and some have eight-cylinder brains . Our commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids operate on all four cylinders we accept them . " Most seem to be hitting on eight , a tribute to the competitive atmosphere . " It 's acceptable to do better here , " says algebra teacher Lois Freeman . " There 's no not doing your assignments to be cool . Everybody 's working because everybody 's doing it . " Students ask for extra work to bring their grades up and call attention to undesirable reading material that somehow slips past the censors . The Christian academies , particularly the ones that got their start during the battle over desegregation , have an uneasy relationship with the Federal government . Given their choice , the schools would treat government regulations the same way that they treat wayward textbooks : ban them . But church-state relations are rarely so neat . In 1978 the Internal Revenue Service proposed stripping church-related schools of their tax-exempt status if they had less than 20 per cent minority enrollment and could not prove a good-faith effort to recruit black students . The Christian schools stopped the proposal with a fierce letter-writing campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that private schools show " affirmative steps " to recruit blacks , such as offering scholarships or race-sensitive courses . That time , the schools got Congress to cut off IRS funding for the proposal . " The government agencies are just trying to get us to repeat the same mistakes that caused them to fail , " says Jack Clayton of the American Association of Christian Schools . The battles continue at the state level . Although church schools go along with fire , health and safety regulations , they bristle at government attempts to control curricula or teacher certification . Kentucky 's Supreme Court has upheld the independence of religious schools , but courts in Ohio , Nebraska and North Dakota have ruled in favor of the state 's right to regulate them . Another case is pending in Michigan , where the state sued Christian schools that refused to comply with teacher-certification re- Andover students wit quirements because they wanted to force a court test . " We do n't desire their approval , and there 's no way for us to get their approval , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our first criterion for choosing a teacher is whether he is a Christian . " The issue of government regulation is complicated by the tar baby of tuition tax credits . If the government is subsidizing private schools , even indirectly , some public officials believe it should be supervising these schools as well . Tax credits would provide an estimated $4 to $6 billion Federal bonanza for private schools , many of them church-related . One such measure was narrowly defeated in Congress three years ago and three others have been introduced this year . The most popular , drafted by Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Robert Packwood of Oregon , would offer a tax credit for half of privateschool tuition up to $250 ( $500 in the second year of the program ) . Unlike Jimmy Carter , who helped defeat the last proposal , President Reagan supports the tax credit and several of its key Senate foes are no longer in office . Christian schools , which formerly opposed the measure for fear of government interference , may be more likely to climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tax credit does not constitute a Federal grant , thus closing a potential window for government regulators . Tax-credit supporters argue that the measure would make schools more competitive and diverse , and give parents a bigger voice in the education of their children . " You should give back to the family its own resources so it can make its own choices as to the kind of education it wants to provide , " says Onalee McGraw of Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank . The new Coleman report touting private-school advantages promises to provide ammunition for that view . David Breneman , an economist at the Brookings Institution , suggests that Moynihan will soon " be standing on the Senate floor waving this report . " 0n the other side of the argument , public-school supporters are waving a few flags of their own . They worry that tax credits would dangerously undermine the public system and create an educational schism . Albert Shanker , of the American Federation of Teachers believes that 5500 would be just a " foot in the door , " prompting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement to place a S1,200 tuition-tax-credit proposal on the November ballot in Washington , D.C. Ernest Boyer , of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , contends that underwriting private tuition at a time when Federal aid to education is declining constitutes " a powerfully important public policy statement " that is none too encouraging for public education . Private schools have been around for a long time , of course ? some longer than the public-school system ? and they 've been there for good reason . They do some things that public schools ca n't and others that public schools should n't . The difference today is that private education is no longer just a high-priced alternative for parents who care ; it is a standing challenge to the public system . The education may not always make " B " minds work in " A " ways . " There 's been no miraculous change , " says Ellen Lippman , a Malibu housewife who recently put all three of her children in private schools . " The older one is still shy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all like to go to school and they are learning . " Unless the public schools can inspire that sort of confidence , they face the prospect of a lot more empty seats .
