Some employers or their insurers have been hit with medical bills of more than $1 million for the care of a single baby. // The special programs include classes , videotaped advice and free consultations with doctors and nurses. // Employers in rural areas and inner cities , where doctors are in short supply , have been especially hard hit by rising medical costs. // " We had a terrible cost problem , " said Kevin M. Breese , employee relations director at the Oster/Sunbeam Company , a division of Allegheny International Inc. in Pittsburgh. // He said Sunbeam , which is self-insured , had to pay a total of about $500 , 000 in medical expenses for four premature infants born to employees at its factory in rural Coushatta , La. , in 1984 . The four cases accounted for half of the $1 million in total health care costs for the plant ' s 600 employees . <> <> ' Didn ' t Even Have Physicians ' // Concern mounted after three more premature births to employees the following year at Coushatta and Sunbeam ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our employees didn ' t even have physicians , " Mr. Breese said . " They were heavy smokers . They had nutritional problems or a family history of high blood pressure. " // Sunbeam started a mandatory maternal educational program in 1986 and urged employees to consult a doctor early in their pregnancies . The average cost per maternity at Coushatta dropped from $27 , 242 in 1984 to below $3 , 000 in 1986. // Since then , he said , only one baby has been born prematurely - to a mother with high blood pressure , whose condition was closely monitored . The company ' s average cost per birth stayed down ; with inflation , it was just above $3 , 200 in 1987 and about $3 , 500 this year. // A premature baby is generally considered one born more than three weeks early , and low birth weight means less than about five pounds. // Sunbeam ' s experience has been repeated at dozens of companies . Burlington Industries , for example , has installed a toll-free telephone number for employees who do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can call the nurse , " said Calvin A. Michaels , director of personnel at Burlington , based in Greensboro , N.C. <> <> Warned on Smoking and Drugs // Chapters of the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation have presented free prenatal seminars at 160 companies around the country , said Irene McKirgan , director of health promotion at the March of Dimes , based in White Plains. // The women are warned of the adverse effects on the infant of smoking , drinking and using drugs . They get advice on proper nutrition and the importance of seeing a doctor early in the pregnancy. // In some cases , employers ' concerns reach beyond their immediate businesses . For example , 21 large companies recently pledged their support for both government and private programs to promote maternal health and child care. // Business executives like Owen B. Butler , retired chairman of the Procter &; Gamble Company and current chairman of the Committee on Economic Development , and William S. Woodside , chairman of Sky Chefs Inc. , have urged Congress and state and city agencies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children. // " Business is increasingly getting involved in supporting that kind of program , and business funds are beginning to flow , " Mr. Woodside said . <> <> The Cost to Society // " Much of our dropout rate starts even before birth , " Mr. Butler said . " The low-birth-weight baby is many times more likely to be an educational failure than a normal-birth-weight infant. " // Moreover , the rising cost of caring for premature babies , which the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment has estimated at $2. 4 billion annually , spreads throughout the economy. // Nearly 15 million women of childbearing age have no private or government health insurance that covers maternity care , according to the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality . One-third of all pregnant women receive prenatal care that is insufficient. // " Even if you do not have women in your work force , you are paying for uncompensated care , whether you know it or not , " said Rae K. Grad , executive director of the commission , which was created by Congress last year. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Willis B. Goldbeck , president of the Washington Business Group on Health , a nonprofit group . " It becomes a community expense . Blue Cross was seeing the impact from people they don ' t insure . " <> <> Million-Dollar Claims // Hospital costs for premature babies have been going up. // " We had a couple of claims of close to $1 million , " said Kevin Bischoff of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Utah . " The average hospital cost in 1987 for a delivery without complications was $1 , 800 . With complications , it was $12 , 925. " // Interest in prenatal care is also growing among unions . The International Ladies Garment Workers Union worked with the March of Dimes in developing a program for recent Chinese immigrants at Local 23-25 in New York . At least two-thirds of the women were getting prenatal information for the first time , said Barry Gewen , a union staff member who initiated the program. // George Bailey , the union ' s director of member assistance , said the program would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York locals. // The city ' s Central Labor Council and the national A.F.L.-C . I.O. are preparing similar health care programs in Los Angeles , Chicago , Cleveland , Minneapolis , Knoxville , Tenn . , San Mateo , Calif. , and Bethlehem , Pa. // At the community level , Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations in California , the District of Columbia , western Pennsylvania , and Utah are working with state and local officials on prenatal education . <> <> Care for Teen-Agers // In Ohio , a citizens commission headed by Mr. Butler of Procter &; Gamble reported to Gov . Richard Celeste earlier this month . " We called for , among other things , better care for pregnant teen-agers , " he said. // Some health care consultants are also promoting prenatal care. // " Most of our clients have seen six-figure and million-dollar preemies , " said Suzanne Peck , a consultant at Towers Perrin in Chicago . " We go directly to the employees and urge them to get a good doctor and visit him as soon as possible , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phylicia Rashad , the actress who plays the mother on " The Cosby Show " on NBC-TV , and her husband , Ahmad , of NBC Sports , appear with their baby on a videotape produced by Towers . " The message to expectant mothers is : Be on top of this . Don ' t let them push you around , " Mrs. Peck said . The women are also urged to question their doctors about the need for Caesarean section deliveries . " Many of the C-sections are unnecessary and the cost can be twice as much as a normal delivery , " she said . <> <> Consultations by Phone // Another consulting firm , Cost Care Inc. , in Huntington Beach , Calif. , provides prenatal consultations by telephone to companies with 200 , 000 employees. // Pregnant employees are required to call a nurse and reply to 25 questions intended to spot risk factors , like diabetes , high blood pressure and previous low- or high-birth-weight babies , said Virginia Cirica , a Cost Care vice president. // In high-risk cases , specialist physicians consult with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple as total bed rest for the last two weeks can prevent early delivery , " Ms. Cirica said . " We want to keep the baby in the womb as long as possible. " //
