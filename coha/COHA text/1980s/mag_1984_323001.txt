It should not fly . Its stubby wings angle forward , putting them under immense stress . Indeed , it is so unstable that no pilot can react fast enough to keep it from dropping out of the sky . Yet the X-29A flew precisely as planned last Friday in its first test flight from California 's Edwards Air Force Base . Pilot Chuck Sewell kept the X-29A aloft at 15,000 ft. for nearly an hour , maintaining a relatively slow speed of 270 m.p.h . His secret : three built-in computers checked all flight-control surfaces 40 times a second , automatically making adjustments to keep the plane airborne . " If I lose all the computers , the airplane self-destructs in two-tenths of a second , " said Sewell . The Pentagon and the Grumman Corp . are gambling some $130 million that the design will eventually give U.S. pilots an advantage in future dogfights.
