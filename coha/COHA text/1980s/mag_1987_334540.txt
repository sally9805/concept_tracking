" I 'm not going to promise you better times , " roared the fiery American preacher as he prowled the stage with Bible held aloft , " but it does n't matter , because you 're going to a better place anyway ! " To many of his eager listeners in a San Salvador stadium , the distant hope of heaven may have been at least momentarily alluring , beset as their nation has been by a seven-year guerrilla war and a moribund economy . When the preacher later assured them that " terrible times are coming , " the applause of approving believers reached a thunderous peak . <P> The crowd pleaser onstage was Jimmy Swaggart , 51 , the flashy Louisiana Pentecostalist who ranks as one of the top TV evangelists in the U.S. In recent years Swaggart has built a surprisingly large and significant following abroad , especially in Latin America . In January he packed the 80,000-seat National Stadium in Santiago , Chile . Last week he wound up a swing through the Central American nations of El Salvador and Costa Rica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama and Honduras . <P> At his three-day revival meeting in San Jose , Costa Rica , the 25,000-seat National Stadium overflowed with spectators for each of three meetings . In San Salvador , more than 50,000 people jammed Flor Blanca Stadium for each of Swaggart 's three rallies . The free-admission programs presented Swaggart at his spellbinding best , even though the words of the non-Spanish-speaking minister had to be filtered through a translator . At the end of each sermon , thousands came forward to be saved . Typewriter Repairman Juan Pablo Campo , celebrating a previous born-again commitment , noted , " I used to smoke , dance , drink and chase women . But since I converted less than a year ago , I have won a good battle with the devil . " <P> As in the U.S. , Swaggart 's celebrity in Latin America is largely the creation of television . His hour-long weekly show is broadcast by 511 Latin American stations and draws more viewers than the program of any other U.S.-based TV evangelist . Among his devotees in San Jose was Rosario Orozco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , " but then the Lord tells me to turn on Jimmy Swaggart , and suddenly everything in life is precious . " Swaggart is not only an orator whose incendiary style appeals to Latin Americans but a creditable gospel singer with a lively band . His proficient road crew lugs along 82 tons of equipment to record proceedings for future broadcasts . <P> Befitting his VIP status , Swaggart moves in lofty circles when he is abroad . In El Salvador , he met with President Jose Napoleon Duarte , who has confessed that he too watches the Swaggart TV show . In Chile , he met Dictator Augusto Pinochet and later urged his audience in Santiago to " pray for General Pinochet and his beautiful wife . " Swaggart usually avoids overt politicking in his Latin American sermons and disclaims partisanship . But the Rev. Jaime Wright , a U.S. Presbyterian working in Brazil , agreeing with Roman Catholic critics , charges that Swaggart and like-minded Evangelicals are giving " uncritical support " to oppressive right-wing regimes .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
