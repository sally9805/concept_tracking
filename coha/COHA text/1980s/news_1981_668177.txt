MILFORD , N.H. - For most of us , it ' s a game called Ping-Pong , and we play it at parties and in other casual settings . But when they set up the equipment at Hampshire Hill ' s Racquet and Health Club on Tuesday nights , it becomes the sport of table tennis . From fall to spring , the members of the New Hampshire Table Tennis Club rents space at Hampshire Hills to keep alive a sport which many of them learned in the basements of their homes as children . Each week , 20 to 25 of the 100 active participants band together to sharpen their skills . Competing in informal handicap tournaments - which see superior players spot points to their opponents - the table tennis faithful seem intent on showing that tennis and racquetball are not alone as viable racquet sports . The NHTTC was formed in 1973 , when a group of Granite State residentsapplied for and received a charter from the US Table Tennis Assn .

Hank Roy , a 37-year-old auto body shop owner from Manchester , is the NHTTC ' s president . As attuned to table tennis trends in the state as anyone , he speaks of the " tremendous interest " in the sport locally . He would like to see it nurtured . " Our skill level is way behind that of New York , Connecticut and Massachusetts , " Roy points out . He says that daily training sessions are the avenue to success at the sport ' s upper levels and that getting youngsters involved early can make the state more competitive . " Table tennis needs key people willing to give time to help develop it , " feels Roy , who hopes better organization will result from exposure gained when the sport goes to the Olympics on a trial basis in 1984 .

Technology has had a hand in making play more aggressive . Naylor cites the use of fast rubber on racquets as a major factor . Sophistication has also brought the cost of staying competitive higher - Naylor paid $30 for his racquet and has a friend who shelled out $80 for a more advanced model . Calling it a " cold weather sport " in these parts , Naylor states that most table tennis players are active in other sports as well . Tennis and racquetball are popular secondary pursuits , though Naylor believes most table tennis buffs are hooked for life . Not to be lost in all this is the fact that virtually anyone can learn to play table tennis to some degree of efficiency . " You just have to play every day for a couple of hours , " says Naylor .
