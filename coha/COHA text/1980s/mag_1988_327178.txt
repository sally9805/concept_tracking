While most of the attention is focusing on appointments to prestigious positions in the White House and Cabinet , many of the Administration 's new policies will be shaped by a less visible layer of sub-Cabinet officials . Bush 's choices for these little-known but powerful posts could foreshadow his decisions on urgent issues that are certain to crop up over the next four years . What to watch for : <P> Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition . A double whammy is in store for the new occupant of this post , created two years ago to coordinate and streamline the world 's biggest purchasing program ( $160 billion a year ) . A federal grand jury is expected soon to indict up to a dozen defense contractors , consultants and former Pentagon officials for fraud . Moreover , budgetary pressures will force the nation 's No. 1 shopper to prune as much as $400 billion from purchases over the next five years . One indication of how difficult the job can be : Richard Godwin , the first man to hold it , quit after only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One out of every six savings and loans has gone bankrupt , and the Treasury Under Secretary will have to concoct a plan to raise $60 billion to bail them out . In his spare time he will oversee the so-called Baker Plan for easing the Third World debt crisis and coordinate efforts to steady the unstable dollar . <P> Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration . With the annual federal health-care tab at more than $140 billion and increasing at more than twice the rate of inflation , the overseer of Medicare and Medicaid will to , have to perform surgery to contain costs . Doctors are already howling over caps on fees , and the National Leadership Commission on Health Care , which found that billions of dollars are wasted annually on services that are not needed and do not work , has just recommended further cuts . The burgeoning long-term medical needs of an expanding elderly population further complicate the job . <P> Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust . Even some big-time investment bankers are wincing at the turmoil created by the megamergers that took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . This prosecutor will have to decide if there is such a thing as a merger that is too big , and if so , how to chop it down to size . <P> Assistant EPA Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response . Bush has promised to do a better job on the environment , which after eight years of not so benign neglect needs attention fast . The new boss of the $8.5 billion Superfund will be caught between environmentalists , outraged that only a fraction of the 1,177 highly contaminated sites on the agency 's list were cleaned up under Reagan , and corporations balking at paying for it . On top of that , this administrator will have to find inventive ways to keep medical syringes and other noxious debris from washing up on the nation 's beaches .
