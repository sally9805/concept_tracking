Congress bars a gas tax <P> Not for nearly 30 years had a Democratic Congress overridden a Democratic President 's veto. * Still , that was exactly what happened to President Carter 's $10 billion oil-import tax last week . The levy , which would have cost the U.S. motorist 10 per gal. , was first rejected by huge margins in both houses . So when Carter carried out his threatened veto , the House did not even debate it . It immediately voted to override the President 's veto by an embarrassing 335 to 34 . From Republican Strategist Robert E. Bauman of Maryland came a victorious yell : " Yahoo ! " Next day the Senate completed the Carter rout , voting against the tax , 68 to 10 . <P> Carter blamed his defeat on congressional spinelessness in an election year . " I recognize the political pressures , " he said in his veto message . " I know this is a difficult issue for many members of Congress . " Nevertheless , he added , the gas tax was " good public policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action to conserve energy , the U.S. would " remain dangerously vulnerable to severe economic disruptions from terrorism , accident , embargo or war . " <P> On the face of it , the President 's case looked like a strong one . Oil imports are still running at a ruinous 6 million bbl. a day , and a new tax would probably cut consumption . Indeed some experts urge a fee of not 10 but 50 or more ( most European nations now charge nearly $2 per gal . in taxes ) . Even so , claims the Administration , the 10 charge would save 100,000 bbl. a day . Congress 's refusal to impose any tax will therefore be hard to explain when Carter goes to Venice later this month to coordinate allied energy policies . <P> Congress tacitly went along with the gas tax when Carter proclaimed it last March . But some of the legislators , notably Connecticut Democrat Toby Moffett , suspected that Carter wanted the fee not only to conserve energy but to balance the budget without asking Congress for any new taxes-perhaps even creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get more figures from the Department of Energy , but was turned down . He and four other Congressmen then joined in a federal lawsuit and won a ruling that Carter had no right to impose such a tax on his own authority . The Administration appealed , and a decision is expected this week . <P> What figures Moffett did pry loose raised some questions about the Administration 's case . While Carter claimed that the fee would save 100,000 bbl. a day , estimates within the DOE ranged as low as 20,000 . And even if the saving really was 100,000 , a $10 billion tax would mean that the U.S. Government was charging American consumers $270 for every barrel saved . <P> Already in trouble , Carter made the tactical situation worse two weeks ago by denouncing a laboriously worked-out congressional compromise on the budget , a move that many Congressmen regarded as interference with their function . The mood of the House turned angry , and the gas tax provided a splendid target for that anger . House Speaker Tip O'Neill blocked all action on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vote showed how overwhelmingly outnumbered he was .
