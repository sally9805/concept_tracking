Titan terror explodes in the Arkansas hills <P> Shortly after sunset one day last week , a maintenance worker on the third level of a silo housing a 103-ft . Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile near Damascus , in the Arkansas hills north of Little Rock , dropped the socket of a wrench . The 3-lb. tool plummeted 70 ft. and punctured a fuel tank . As flammable vapors escaped , officials urged the 1,400 people living in a five-mile radius of the silo to flee . The instructions : " Do n't take time to close your doors-just get out . " <P> And with good reason . At 3:01 a.m. , as technicians gave up trying to plug the leak and began climbing from the silo , the mixture of fuel and oxygen exploded . Orange flames and smoke spewed out , lighting up the sky over Damascus . The blast blew off a 750-ton concrete cover . One worker was killed ; 21 others were hurt . <P> Officials reported that no radiation leaked from the missile , which was tipped with a multimegaton nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week involving U.S. nuclear weapons ; the first was a fire at Grand Forks Air Force Base , N. Dak. , that damaged a B-52 bomber thought to be carrying 32 shortrange , nuclear missiles . <P> The incidents reopened the debate over the safety of the U.S. nuclear arsenal , particularly of the 54 liquid-fuel Titan II missiles , which date from 1963 ; 18 of them are based in Arkansas , the rest in Arizona and Kansas . Air Force Secretary Hans Mark , a rocketry expert , insists that the Titans are not obsolete and are " a perfectly safe system to operate , " despite 40 mishaps in ten years , two of them resulting in deaths or injuries . At the very least , Democratic Senator David Pryor of Arkansas demanded , the Air Force should set up a more effective warning system for Titan II sites . Said he : " Right now we are using the Paul Revere method-word of mouth . "
