Kissinger gives his world view <P> The contrast between the two approaches to U.S. foreign policy could hardly have been more marked . President Carter , addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors , concentrated almost entirely on two specific crises , Iran and Afghanistan , and strongly defended his actions in each . The next speaker , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , went far beyond those issues to deliver a sweeping global critique . He charged the Administration with lacking a world view that would produce a consistent policy and offered one of his own in a dour tour d'horizon of impressive scope . <P> " I happen to agree with President Carter that the danger to our country is the gravest in the modern period , " said Kissinger . " We are sliding toward a world out of control , with our relative military power declining , with our economic lifeline increasingly vulnerable to blackmail , with hostile radical forces growing in every continent , and with the number of countries willing to stake their future on our friendship dwindling . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapple with four interrelated issues : <P> 1 ) The Balance of Military Power . It is shifting so rapidly against the U.S. , said Kissinger , that in a future confrontation " like that in Cuba in 1962 or the Mideast alert in 1973 , it will be the Soviet Union which will possess the quantitative superiority in strategic weapons . " The danger , he said , " is less an imminent nuclear attack on us than an increased Soviet willingness to run risks in local conflicts . " In such cases , said Kissinger , Soviet superiority in conventional arms could no longer be offset by a credible threat of U.S. nuclear retaliation . " The present Administration has compounded the problem by systematically deprecating the role of power , by canceling or stretching out every strategic program it inherited . " <P> 2 ) The Geopolitical Equation . Said Kissinger : " By this I mean the alignments and assessments that determine whether moderates friendly to us or radicals hostile to us dominate key regions ; whether our alliances are vital or sliding toward lassitude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running : " Precariously situated countries in the Middle East see the Soviet-supported Cuban advance coming up through Africa to Ethiopia right across the Red Sea . To them the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan now overshadows the Persian Gulf like the northern arm of a great pincer . And they see no effective resistance . Somewhere , somehow , the United States must show that it is capable of rewarding a friend or penalizing an opponent . " Otherwise , he said , the " inevitable effect is to accelerate the demoralization of all moderate allies , driving friends toward neutralism and neutrals toward radicalism . "
