" We ' re in serious trouble , " said Jack E. Sonnenblick , chairman of the Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation , a mortgage brokerage concern . " The fellow who has a loan of one or two million dollars coming due and the bank wants 18 percent - the owner has no choice . In some cases there ' s not enough income . " The only long-term solution is cooperative conversion , he said. // All income-producing properties , whether they are office buildings , shopping centers or residential dwellings , need access to mortgage financing on a continuing basis if they are to thrive as investments for their owners and usable shelters for their occupants . The different forms of property compete for the available capital , as real estate itself competes for capital with other forms of investment. // As mortgage financing dries up , the properties become less attractive to buy or keep . In New York City , the combination of inflation in operating costs and lagging rents set this process in motion years ago . Accordingly , there has been little production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except where opportunities for eventual conversion to cooperatives or condominiums are foreseen . <> <> Money for ' Top-Notch ' Projects // As for prospects of additional capital to let owners take profits out of their property or make the major improvements older buildings require , " forget it , " said William S. Brennen , former president of the Greenwich Savings Bank. // The general picture does not hold for all properties . " Over all , there ' s an adequate supply of money available to finance any topnotch project that comes along , " said Andrew J. Singer , partner in the mortgage brokerage concern of Ackman Bros . &; Singer . A " topnotch " project is one in a strong market location with average rents above $200 a room per month , he said . That is about $700 for a onebedroom apartment. // But he said there were " a slew of apartments in the city " without the income to refinance their loan balances at current rates . The median monthly rent in the city last year was $265 an apartment , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // A new and more ominous chapter began in 1980 , when mortgage rates took a sudden leap , persisting at extraordinary levels since late 1980 . Not only did inflation erode the level of building income available to carry mortgage debt , but also the savings banks and savings and loan associations , the traditional mortgage lenders , suffered large decreases in the amount of money on deposit . The decreases have in some cases put them out of business. // The savings banks have " no way to provide the capital infusion necessary to keep rental housing going , " said Kathryn Wylde , assistant to the president of the Anchor Savings Bank. // For the many people in the city who would like to live in decent and affordable rental housing , the prospect , according to real estate experts , would seem to be an ever-shrinking supply . Little new housing will be built , the experts said , and what remains of the existing stock will tend to be converted to cooperatives where possible. // " It ' s sad , " said the chief mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental loans , who has examined the balance sheets on a number of rental properties . " With all the rent increases over the last several years , the price increases have eaten it up . There ' s no way to go back and pay double the rate for money . " He described the effect of the drastic increases in mortgage rates in the last two years as a " time bomb ticking away . " <> <> ' As Liquid as Possible ' // Michael Martinelli , assistant regional director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , said that thrift institutions suffering the effects of deposit losses were trying to stay " as liquid as possible " and did not have the money for additional loans. // " Unless interest rates drop drastically - to 10 or 12 percent - you ' re not going to find the banks making mortgage loans on these properties , " he said , referring to the prospects for the funds needed for major repairs and improvements. // The properties with uninsured non-self-liquidating mortgages are the most vulnerable to the increasing toughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenders agreed . The Manhattan-based savings banks , among the largest lenders to conventionally financed rentals , have also been among the hardest hit by deposit withdrawals as depositors seek higher yields. // Moreover , there is no recent record of appreciation in the value of rental property , unless it is in a location where it can be purchased speculatively for a cooperative conversion , the experts said . Thus , they said , there is no opportunity for so-called shared equity financing , in which the lender gives more favorable terms in a financing but expects to share the profits in a future sale . This type of financing has become common as an offset to high interest rates in providing financing to commercial and office properties . <> <> Financing Factors Differ // The Rent Stabilization Association , whose members own 900 , 000 stabilized apartments in the city , is expected to seek from the Rent Guidelines Board some system to make interest rates figure systematically in the calculations of allowable rent increases. // Although the board has tried to account for this factor in past rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ radically from building to building . Some buildings , for example , still benefit from 4 percent , 40-year mortgages incurred by the Federal Housing Administration . Others have benefited from turnover and are in strong market areas , and still produce a high return for their owners. // Most tenant groups and tenant spokesmen on the guidelines board have long contended that it is not proper to build a factor for financing costs into the price index for operating needs , on which the rent increases set by the board under stabilization are based . At the time rent stabilization went into effect , in the late 1960 ' s , interest rates were relatively stable , and the theory was that stabilization would provide landlords with a " fair return " if rent increases were geared to the rise in operating costs. // In the early 1970 ' s , so-called " balloon " mortgages , usually running for 10 or 15 years , were placed on many buildings . In this standard method of rental finance , large amounts of principal are still owed when the mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the owner , the building , the location and the bank itself . " When the loan comes up , we appraise and inspect the property and evaluate the owner ' s ability to pay , " said David O ' Shea , senior vice president of the Metropolitan Savings Bank , which now has merged with the Brooklyn Savings Bank and the Greenwich Savings Bank . " He has to live also or else he ' s going to walk , and we don ' t want that. " // The Metropolitan generally renews loans for soundly managed properties at 16 or 17 percent , Mr. O ' Shea said , but only for five years based on an amortization schedule that varies on the basis of the owner ' s ability to make payments and still have a return. // But other institutions are reported by building owners to be seeking to get the principal on outstanding loans substantially repaid . In some cases they are " calling " the loan - demanding that they be paid off - or asking that they run " open , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent. //
