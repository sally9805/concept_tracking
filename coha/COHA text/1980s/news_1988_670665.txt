But now the link between AIDS and intravenous drug abuse has forced it , like treatment centers nationwide , to dramatically rethink its approach. // Instead of offering hope , said Robert P. Galea , the center ' s president , " we find ourselves dealing with issues of death and dying . " <> <> Dealing With New Reality // The old message - stop using drugs and you can get your life together - can be powerless with addicts who are ill with AIDS or infected with the virus and who know their prospects of long life are not good. // The new message is that hope alone is not enough : addicts and drug-treatment centers can no longer ignore the reality of AIDS , Mr. Galea and others assert. // As many as 70 percent of the addicts Spectrum House is treating will return to drug use , counselers here say . They say they have an obligation not only to teach the virtues of a drug-free life but also to instruct recovering addicts about how AIDS spreads and , specifically , how to use clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and needle-sharing is particularly urgent , they argue , for those clients who have AIDS or are infected with the virus. // That Spectrum House will tackle AIDS and drug addiction in a rehabilitation program sets it apart from many other treatment programs , which fear talking about specifics like needle-sharing with addicts will make the pyschologically wrenching recovery process all the more difficult. // AIDS presents " a special problem for therapeutic communities , " said Don C. Des Jarlais , coordinator for AIDS research at the New York State Division of Substance Abuse Services . Some are aggressively responding but " the majority are clearly not , " he said. // A few years ago , Mr. Galea said , he was " ostracized " for addressing the issue of AIDS and drug addiction . He recalled a colleague saying , " The day we teach someone to sterilize needles is the day we close down . " Today other treatment programs are imitating the organization ' s educational approach ; Mr. Galea has attended conferences and made presentations about it in this country and abroad. // Spectrum House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intravenous drug abuse since 1985 , Mr. Galea said . That year , a client who had been drug-free for five years developed AIDS symptoms and later died . He had also infected his wife . <> <> A Rise in Anxiety // " It really began to hit us that our program was at risk , " Mr. Galea said , noting the increased " anxiety level " among the others who were being treated. // " If you are positive , the temptation is to shoot dope and kill yourself , but there are a lot of reasons to straighten out , " said Jonathan Heins of New York City , a Spectrum House client who said he had spent 19 of his 34 years as a heroin addict . Shortly after Mr. Heins arrived at Spectrum House about a year ago , blood tests showed that he was infected with the AIDS virus . Today , he says he is grateful to be alive. // " Life has never been better for me , " he said . Mr. Heins is working full time in a drug detoxification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the effort expended on his own behalf. // " I have a lot of hope , " Mr. Heins said. // That reaction is typical , Mr. Galea said . People who find they are infected with the AIDS virus stay longest in the program and are most concerned about their health , he said . " Somehow they want to lead a life and a good life. " // The connection between intravenous drug use and the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is gaining more attention because it is seen in health circles as the primary link to heterosexuals in the United States . Sharing of needles by intravenous drug abusers accounts for 24 percent of all AIDS cases , according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control , and the percentage is rising . <> <> A Slowing in One Instance // The virus that causes AIDS can spread through exchange of blood , such as in the sharing of needles by drug users . But it also spreads through sexual intercourse , so infected addicts can pass the virus to sexual partners . Infected women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Surveys in some cities suggest that the spread of the AIDS virus among homosexual men , who still account for the majority of the nation ' s cases , has greatly slowed , and homosexuals account for a declining percentage of total cases. // Spectrum House has grown substantially since 1969 , when it was founded as a modest community response to increasing drug abuse . Last year , the nonprofit organization , which has about 80 staff members , treated 1 , 300 addicts. // Up to 65 clients at a time live in the residential program here , a quiet , six-acre campus about 30 miles west of Boston . About 260 are admitted each year , and more than 600 people are treated in a detoxification center in Worcester , a 15-minute drive west . Most clients , as Spectrum House refers to its patients , are poor and are an average of 29 years old . A 10-year history of drug abuse is not unusual. // In 1985 , realizing that 40 percent of its clinical staff were former intravenous users and that there was recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS education a priority for staff members and patients . Clients in residential treatment were polled to determine what they knew about AIDS . The results , which showed the clients were interested in AIDS education , helped form the basis of the education effort that followed and continues today. // Spectrum House first instituted staff training . Later , AIDS education , testing and counseling became integrated with the clients ' drug-treatment program . They have group discussions on AIDS , attend seminars , watch films and talk individually with staff members on how AIDS is spread and on safer practices to avoid infection . People who are infected or have AIDS are permitted to remain as long as they are physically capable of doing so. #75% Tested for Virus Clients are told that they have the option of being tested for the virus . About 75 percent take the test . Of Spectrum House ' s 65 residential clients , 9 have tested positive for the AIDS virus , which means they can spread the virus to others through sex and needle-sharing , and that they have a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detoxification center one recent week , 8 of 25 people tested positive. // Infection with the AIDS virus makes treatment for drug addiction all the more difficult . It is a " resocialization experience , " Mr. Des Jarlais said . It is " painful , stressful , tough , requires great commitment and a willingess to put up with great self-examination , " he said . " If you lose hope of a normal life afterwards , then why go through those tough changes ? " Mr. Des Jarlais said. // At first , clients and even some staff members at Spectrum House resisted education efforts ; some even fell asleep in discussion groups . But after about six months , as staff members became more comfortable with the topic , clients began taking a more active role in discussion. // Counselors approach the issue through discussions of life in the streets or in shooting galleries . This approach , where an abuser ' s past may be vividly recalled and the future called into question , risks losing addicts to the street before they have made any progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House acknowledge this but are willing to take the risk. // " From drug-free , to the notion of using drugs as safely as possible , was a major change for me , " said Mr. Galea , who used intravenous drugs in the 1960 ' s . <> <> ' They Were Frightened ' // Wayne Ronan , a Spectrum House client for seven months , says he was " devastated " when blood tests taken last summer showed that he was infected with the AIDS virus . Mr. Ronan , a 35-year-old native of Salem , Mass. , who had been an intravenous drug user for 15 years , Mr. Ronan encountered a chilly response on entering a half-way house . " They were frightened , " he said . " People pushed me away. " // Mr. Ronan said he returned to the street , shooting dope and sharing needles .
