Now that Wall Street has been in a bear market for nearly six months , some venturesome investors are searching out " cheap " stocks to buy . Of course , just about all the merchandise a stockbroker has to offer has been marked down significantly since last summer . But some stocks may , upon appraisal , look cheaper than others . How to identify them ? One handy way is to plug several statistical measures into a computer program and instruct the machine to search the market for stocks that meet those criteria . Norman Weinger and Michael Metz , analysts at the investment firm of Oppenheimer &; Co. , who are well known on Wall Street for computer screening studies of this type , have just completed one . They found " deep discount stocks " predominating in electric utilities , banking , insurance , savings and loans , and some household-name blue chips as well . " No investment decision is warranted on the basis of these figures alone , " they caution . If a stock is out of favor , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be used as a starting point in a quest for unusually attractive values , " Weinger and Metz say . The analysts set three standards for a stock to qualify as deeply discounted : - Its price-earnings ratio had to be at least one-third below the average for the market as a whole , as measured by Standard &; Poor ' s index of 400 industrials. - It must carry a dividend yield at least one-third more than the S &; 400. - The ratio of its stock price to book value , or theoretical worth if the company were to be liquidated , must be at least one-third below the aggregate ratio for the S &; 400 . The two biggest names that showed up on Weinger and Metz ' s screen were General Motors Corp. and Sears , Roebuck &; Co. - prime examples of " companies that clearly would be affected by any slowdown in consumer spending , " the analysts noted . Also conspicuous by its presence is Merrill Lynch &; Co . Inc. , reflecting the depressed state of the securities industry . Numerous banking concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the right word ) to worries about loans in Third World countries and in real estate and energy deals . Representatives from the insurance industry include such prominent participants as Aetna , Cigna , Continental and Travelers . From the savings and loan group : H.F. Ahmanson , Calfed and Great Western Financial . And then there are no less than 57 utilities , from Atlantic Energy to Pacificorp . This is , according to Weinger and Metz , " an industry undergoing significant change . Perhaps the most important change is that capital requirements ( e. g. , for new plants and other facilities ) are tending to flatten or decline . " " As a result , some utilities are becoming net cash generators rather than the insatiable consumers of capital they were in the 1970s . " It is estimated that the industry in aggregate will be able to cover its capital requirements entirely from internal cash generation by 1989 . This development has favorable implications for the industry ' s investment status . " Improving debt-to-equity ratios could provide the basis for an upward valuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger proportion of reported earnings in dividends . " The group may command considerably greater investment interest as a result of the recent market decline and greater concern about prospects for continued economic growth. "
