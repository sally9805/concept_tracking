" My favorite director of all time is Howard Hawks , " Carpenter said over lunch recently , expressing admiration for the maker of " Red River , " " Bringing Up Baby , " " The Big Sleep , " and other classics . " Movies are an entertainment medium , and that ' s the way I like to treat them . I want to affect the audience emotionally , because that ' s what I believe films can do best. " // Carpenter is a young , good-looking man from Kentucky , who still carries more than a trace of a Southern accent . He began his first feature film in 1970 ; it began as a student project and " just grew " into a movie called " Dark Star . " He now has six productions to his credit . He met his wife , actress Adrienne Barbeau , while directing a TV movie called " Someone ' s Watching Me . " She stars in his latest picture , a fantasy called " The Fog. " // Just now , Carpenter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box office and is planning his next picture . He won ' t talk much about the new one because the story is in the public domain , and someone might steal it from under his nose . But it appears to be a western called " El Diablo . " After that , he ' s expected to do a remake of Howard Hawks ' s " The Thing , " this time sticking closer to the original John W. Campbell sci-fi story ( which is not nearly as powerful as the old Hawks film ) . // Conversing with Carpenter , you soon notice a certain intensify  --  he calls it " single-mindedness "  --  lurking behind even the most casual movie talk . Though he shares this quality with many other young directors , he seems unusually conscious that major American filmmakers occupy a privileged and perhaps precarious position . Like a Howard Hawks hero , he relies on alertness and professionalism to bring him through. // " Lately , people have suddenly started asking me about money , " he laments . " People wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks . The truth is , I ' ve never made big bucks . I ' ve hardly even thought of that. // " It ' s so hard and risky to make a film ! And the chances are that you ' ll never make any money . I ' ve done lots of them for free . Money has only entered my mind since ' Halloween ' did so well , " he concludes , referring to his next-to-last film  --  a thriller that has become the most successful independent production of all time , with United States returns of $20 million on a $300 , 000 investment. // On the other hand , he acknowledges that " movies and money are associated in everybody ' s mind . And that image is often fostered by people who haven ' t made any money at all . The point is that moviemaking is my job . And in our culture , you ' re defined largely by what you do . You are what you produce. " // Carpenter sounds more Hawksian than ever as he continues , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of us , and there aren ' t many of us working . As a profession it ' s tough , competitive , and high-tension , with a lot of pressure and visibility . The guys I ' m always reminded of are the air-traffic controllers  --  though they have a tougher time of it , because it ' s really life or death. . . . " // Even when money is scarce and pressure is high , however , Carpenter loves his work . HE learned the trade in film school . " I directed , wrote , edited , and everything else , " he recalls . " But it wasn ' t the real world . You didn ' t have to keep on a schedule or anything . When I did my first full-length film , it was very different  --  a real shock. " // His first " real movie " was " Dark Star , " a tiny-budget science-fiction film that has become a cult favorite , and is currently being re-released in the United States , for the benefit of fans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost everybody missed it the first time around . ) It ' s the whimsical tale of a beat-up old rocketship , carrying a crew that ' s bored stiff with outer space . One major character is an " alien " that looks like a beachball with two huge feet . Another character is a computerized bomb that wants to explode in the wrong place . The captain ' s solution to the dilemma ? " Teach it phenomenology , " he suggests  --  whereupon a spaceman engages the computer in a long and zany philosophical discourse. // In some of its ideas , " Dark Star " is like a dry run for Ridley Scott ' s successful movie " Alien , " which was also scripted by Dan O ' Bannon . Yet " Dark Star " totally avoids the violence of " Alien , " going for goofy humor instead . Carpenter calls it a " weird and strange " movie . It ' s also hilariously funny. // After " Dark Star , " Carpenter continued to cut his teeth by making " Assault on Precinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TV movies including " Elvis , " which he remembers as the only one of his works that isn ' t " personal . " Except for that one , he says , " they were all basically crafted by me and are pretty much the way I wanted them. " // Carpenter is proud of the movies he has assembled for extremely small amounts of money . Even today  --  when $1 million is considered a dangerously low budget  --  he feels a good film can be made for $100 , 000 or so . " There ' s still that possibility , " he says , " if you have a camera and a recorder and a couple of actors willing to work for you. // In fact , I kind of yearn for those days sometimes. " // When he talks like this , Carpenter conjures up images of the old Hollywood days , when fascinating work was sometimes done by the directors with the lowest budgets and the most obscure projects  --  simply because little risk was involved and they were free to experiment . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuation of an " underground " wave of low-budget creativity ? // " That ' s exactly what it is , " says Carpenter . " And I think it ' s real healthy . I hope it ' ll always stay , because it reminds us that you can do it **28;120; real <> cheap. // " The trouble is , it ' s hard to do a film of any visual complexity this way . And it ' s hard to go back , once you ' ve moved on . Once I made my first film in Panavision and Metrocolor , with a big crew and dollies and sound stages , I didn ' t want to return to the other way. " // Still , Carpenter ' s latest film bears traces of those bygone days . The title sequence of " The Fog "  --  " where the town falls apart "  --  was shot " on the run . " As Carpenter describes it , " It was just me and a camera and a couple of people . No lights . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " // Does Carpenter feel he will change one day to more openly " serious " films ? Perhaps not . " I take what I do very seriously , " he says , " and I ' m proud of it , whether it ' s a fantasy or whatever . I ' m interested in these subjects . I have a certain feeling for them , and they express certain things in me. // " I don ' t want to be anybody else except who I am , or make any films but the ones I make . I have certain ideas about movies . Most of this is subconscious . What matters is whether I connect with the material emotionally . I don ' t try to analyze it too carefully. " // So Carpenter would never do what Woody Allen did , for example , and make a film in the overtly serious style of an Ingmar Bergman . " To me , that ' s a very self-conscious and pretentious style of moviemaking , " he says . " It doesn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affect the audience emotionally . To do an Ingmar Bergman-type film would be dishonest and phony for me. " // Summing it up , Carpenter refers to an example of the movie style he **28;150; does <> respect . " There ' s a picture called ' Magnun Force ' where Clint Eastwood walks around and says one of the truest things anyone could say : ' A man has to know his limitations . ' That ' s a great strength . Once you know your limitations , you know who you are . And I think I know my limitations. . . . " // //
