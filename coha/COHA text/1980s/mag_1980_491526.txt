Speaking Out Causes , things we believe in , can be shared when we are willing to communicate them with pride and dignity and to make no apology for them . So let me state at the onset my own personal beliefs : Number one , I believe I was created by God and , therefore , I am somebody . And I refuse to go through life hung over and bent out of shape , acting like I am some insignificant nobody . I think we have come out of an age during which too many young people were apologetic about who they were instead of standing up for what they were and what they believed . Therefore , you should know I believe that I am important . Number two , I believe that God knows me , He can call me by name , and He put me here on this earth for a reason . And since He did that , I move forward with confidence , knowing I am a child of His . Therefore , if I am that , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must love you and respect you also . Periodically , as we move through life , people worry about our super-confidence . " My , you think you are somebody , " they say . And I say , " I am somebody , " and therefore I go forward with that attitude in all my associations . Number three , I believe that success is not sinful . I will say that again for you . Success is not sinful . We live in a period when somehow , especially as Americans , the achievements of America are held up to ridicule . Hungry people in the world say , " Do n't you feel guilty that you have a full stomach ? " My answer is , " No . " I do not apologize for the achievements of our nation . That does not mean I am not concerned about the hungry people of the world , but I also know that if I eat less someone else will not , therefore , automatically eat more . The achievements of our land in feeding our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather something weshould learn to share and teach others to accomplish . When we do that , we will have made great progress . There is always a great deal of conversation about how to help the hungry and the downtrodden and the disadvantaged . But you will never lift them up by lowering yourself . Therefore , I urge you to continue to develop and maintain a level of confidence and to serve as an example , as we have in this country for so many years , so that others in the world might follow it . We hear all the arguments  --  socialist dogma versus capitalism , the free enterprise system and socialism . It sounds so wonderful to the uninformed ... how we should all share with one another . But our experiences with socialism on a worldwide basis indicate that it provides an equal share of poverty , not prosperity . I have yet to find poor nations that can help other poor nations . Only those nations that work in confidence and achieve have the ability to then , in turn , with love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with platitudes about sharing . You can only feed hungry people with food . That means you should concentrate on what it takes to grow food . That is what I call getting to the solution of a problem , and not just making idle statements about who ought to do what . This brings me back to my belief that success is not sinful . The other day a young lady came to my office from a Christian college in our city . Well-intentioned as they might have been , students in her classroom had been discussing the fact that my company owned a jet airplane . They decided that was wrong . I asked her how she got to the office . She said she drove her car . I said , " That is wrong . You must ride the bus . If you think it is wrong for me to have an airplane , then it is wrong for you to have a car . If I should ride the airlines , you should ride a bus . " The class  --  and the young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if a used Cadillac was all right ; or was a new Chevy good and a new Cadillac wrong ? Were three bathrooms in a house right and four out of step ? How would you arrive at that concept in the classroom  --  that somehow achievement was a sinful experience ? It is not the achievement which is wrong . The falling in love with one 's self or with the material goods that one may have acquired is evil , not the achievement . I am very concerned about the confusion that exists about that . A most dangerous concept prevails in too many parts of our land . . . the idea that somehow we must all settle for averages instead of striving for excellence , outstanding performance , and upholding greater levels of achievement . Recently a man in the White House said that we must all learn to settle for less in America and we should all learn to get along at a little lower level . I asked him , " By whose standard do you think we should get by for less ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are behind us in the rest of the world will have to settle for even less . " We must continue to be an example , serving and uplifting the hopes and needs of our people  --  all people  --  because they will grow only when they have hope and the belief in the concept of being rewarded for achievement . There are four basic stages that we go through . We go through them as a nation and as individuals . Institutions such as churches go through them , and so do women 's clubs . In fact , we go through these steps personally as well as collectively . Let 's take a look . Stage One is " build . " This nation was built by people who believed in achievement . It faltered in its first couple of years on a dream of collectivism ; and the colonies at Jamestown and at Plymouth Rock started with the idea of working together and sharing together for the ideal state of socialism . At the end of two years they Con tinued on page 83 Success continued from page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to progress . At that time Governor Bradford , in Plymouth , said , " From now on , each shall be rewarded in relationship to what he or she does , " and in the next year and from that year forward America has never been hungry . Fasci-nating ? As Governor Bradford pointed out , during the previous year , when everybody ate even if they did n't work , he was amazed how many were tired and sick or had to stay home with the children . But the next year , when they were rewarded in relationship to what they produced , the women took their children into the fields , and those who were sick suddenly found themselves well because they would be rewarded in relation to what they did . The harvest that year was the beginning of our period of great thanksgiving because of abundance . It was all because of a simple shift to rewarding people for what they did instead of permitting them to live off the efforts of others . Then America moved forward , and we said , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young man . " Achievements were heaped upon achievements as we were challenged to greater levels of accomplishment . So , America moved forward as a free society to become a major force in the world because all of its people were free . That is why we became the greatest of all nations . I have watched our churches . When young ministers or individual laypeople decide to start a new church , they devote all of their efforts to the concept of building their local church , and they share their faith and they welcome people , and virtually all of their energies are expended in welcoming the new ; and they grow and prosper and become a great force . Building by being builders  --  many people have improved themselves and found fulfillment in their lives . But something funny happens on the way to building a business or an organization or a Continued on page 99 Success continued from page 83 church or a government . And that is Stage Two . Stage Two is the management stage . It is when we learn to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . We must get involved in politics . As we built a nation , we needed representatives in our government . In the earliest stages this was something that the man did when he was n't farming : He went and served his country . We moved from a nation of believers and builders into one whose citizens devoted their energies not to being builders but to managing what was built . There were local officials and state officials and county officials and national officials who oversaw the affairs of the nation  --  a worthy goal and an important one . I see ministers or priests who build successful churches who get busy managing the parish or the denomination or the church , and they are so busy managing it they no longer have time to reach out and share with the unchurched , because " we must take care of the flock . " The next thing you know , all of the discussions revolve around things like , Will the choir have robes or not ? Will we have seats or will we have pews in our church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Will it be an electronic organ or a chord organ or a pipe organ ? Will the minister get a car or wo n't he get a car ? Will he have an expense account or wo n't he have an expense account ? Will we have air conditioning or wo n't we have air conditioning ? How are we going to handle the janitor ? Who is going to keep the robes clean ? Who is going to buy the soap , and where are they going to buy the soap ? We have to make sure the collections are taken and properly stowed . We need a safe . We need a checking account , a deposit account . All of this is part of management . But we get so busy managing the church , the church levels out and fails to progress . When President Ford , who comes from Grand Rapids , took office , I stopped by to visit him , taking ten minutes to humor him a little bit . He needed a little relaxation once in a while ! His people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do n't you just go in there and chat about the old times ; give him a little break in his day . So at that time we did . " Hey , Ford , are you in Stage Three ? " He says , " What do you mean , am I in Stage Three ? " Well , I started giving him this little speech , and so I will show youwhere I think America is now  --  in Stage Three . Stage Three is a result of Stage Two : It 's a defensive posture for the failure to grow . You see , once you were a builder and had fulfilled dreams and people were concurring . Then you had to manage all of that . You stopped growing . Now you have to defend a non-growth policy . That is what our men in government do , and that is what Barry Bosworth of the Office of Wage and Price Control said recently , " You must settle for less . " What he is really saying to you is , " Since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are going to sell you on accepting the poor job we are doing . " You are going to have to tell your kids they ca n't progress . All throughout our lives we have said to our children , " You can do better , you can do more . There are challenges throughout the world , there are hunger problems which are solvable . Go do it , " Now we say , " No , settle down , kid . " We have a defensive posture . We are in a holding pattern . We ride through this difficult period  --  we set into motion a whole string of defensive actions . The government politicians and bureaucrats talk to us about the energy problem . " We must allocate energy . " So , we created the Department of Energy under James Schlesinger . The dear energy man would become the chief manager of the rationing process and President Carter would make headlines , trying to be the first to knock the oil companies , put them down , make them look bad . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reaching out to make a greater America and thus being able to help the people all over the world  --  we begin to set up a syndrome of backing down and defending our non-growth policy with all kinds of rationale . We say , " Oh , we ca n't let those oil companies get all those windfall profits . We are going to have to keep those boys under control . " The fascinating part of that , of course , is that if you took all the windfall profits after Uncle takes half  --  they split off the top 50.50 ? most of the windfall falls on Washington . The balance gets spread around the industry . However , the so-called windfall profits of $2.5 or $3 billion are one-fourth of what it takes to run the Department of Energy , which has an annual budget in excess of $11 billion . So it takes $11 billion to run the rationing system , and the energy department does n't find any oil at all . Continued on page 124 Success continued from page 99 Because of the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to defend their position and allocate the resource . That is the result of no longer being builders . So instead of moving ahead to solve the problem , we end up allocating the resource . Now as I say , that is true in business . In business we say , " Well , we do better if we do n't have so many government regulations . We would do better if we were in the South than if we were in the North ; or we would do better in the West . We would do better if we were younger ; or maybe if we knew more and were older we would do better . " You pick out your own defense posCon t. on following page ture to justify your lack of growth . I could take that for you on an individual basis , too . A young person comes out of school , high school , college , and has dreams and hopes . He can be president . He can go to the top . He can be a top achiever . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world  --  and all the other great things ahead . But as soon as he gets married , he ends up with two , three kids , he has a little budget , he has house payments , he has diaper rental services , and pretty soon he is so busy managing his little household that his dream disappears . Instead of reaching for greatness , he gets embroiled in the nitty-gritty of life . And he sits home , with a bad government ; or he accepts Skinner 's philosophy that your environment , not you , determines your future . I totally disagree with Mr. Skinner when he says that if your mother had only cuddled you more you would be somebody . The error of his statement is that we have forgot only given me some more money , we would have gotten something going . " In the church , the preacher says , " If the constituency of the governing body of the church had only increased , we would have had a greater outreach . " The constituency says , " If we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . " In Washington , the President says the Congress is to blame ; and the Congress says the President is to blame . And they all agree that it is the citizens who have lost their dedication to sacrifice  --  that if our citizens would only lower their level of expectations , we could get on with it . " Why should our people be mad ? We are only taking 40 percent of their income . Ca n't they understand we can spend it more intelligently than they can ? " That is their attitude . And so they blame all of us . When you get to Stage Four , unless you are careful , you will never recover from it , because you will destroy each other in the fingerpointing process . The citizen will finally blame his neighbor , condemn his richer neighbor and say , " It is your fault I do n't have more . " And the richer person will condemn the poorer person and say , " Why do n't you get on with it ? " That is happening right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of our people as builders of a greater land and , thus , a greater world , we end up finger-pointing , not problem-solving . I am fascinated with the fact that up until recently I could go any place I wanted and say , " Give me ten gallons , " and they did . It was n't a big deal . Somehow somebody got that oil out of the ground , got it cleaned up , refined , shipped , and put it in tanks in all of our cities . Any place I wanted to go , I could say , " Give me ten gallons , " and I got it ! What a fantastic achievement . It is almost as great as the achievement of milk . I am fascinated that any place I go in this land I can say , " A glass of milk , please . " And ten to sell the idea that it does n't matter where you come from or what your background is , it is up to you to make things happen in your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , if my mother had only done this or my father had only done that , or I had only been brought up in a different neighborhood , I would have done something worthwhile . " Mr. Skinner is totally in the defensive posture of giving all of our young people and others an excuse for nonperformance . I refuse to accept that . We must instill in individuals , in our government , in our organizations , the concept of being builders instead of defenders and excuse-makers for where we are and what we have or have not done . The last step is called " blame , " finger-pointing . " If we only had a better president , we would have done more . " And the president says , " Well , if those local clubs hadsomeone hands it to me . Somebody had to feed the cow and milk it , refrigerate the milk , pasteurize it , package it and haul it to the store . All across this land , you can say , " Give me a glass of milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all done in our free enterprise system by people who are builders . Out of that has come the fulfillment of many of the things for which we have hoped . So , my challenge is a very simple one : It is time we got back to being builders . It is time we stopped talking about who is responsible for the energy problem and got on to finding the solution . I do n't care who is at fault . It does n't make any difference . All I want is to solve it . All I hear now is blame being fixed , with investigation upon investigation as to who is responsible . And it does n't make one bit of difference . It is time America moved back to Stage Cont. on following page One . I see an America where no man fears to think as he pleases or say what he thinks . I see an America where no man is another man 's master , where no man 's mind is dark with fear . I see an America as the horizon of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our abilities to complete it , I answer : To act with enthusiasm and faith is the condition of acting great . It is time we got back to building our nation and our neighbors , and lifting all of the people of the world who believe in freedom and human dignity . That is not true of all the world . But it is time that those of us who believe that we were created by God and we have human rights and human dignity and are to be respected as persons as opposed to bowing to the state , joined together to lift up one another and become builders for a greater future .
