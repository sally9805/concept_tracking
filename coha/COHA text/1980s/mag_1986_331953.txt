A Toyota sedan drew up to the hillside Dublin mansion of John Guinness , a local banker related to the celebrated clan of brewers . After ringing the doorbell , three hooded men , brandishing guns , forced their way into the house and began ransacking it for valuables . Then they started to make off with Guinness 's daughter Gillian , 23 , before acceding to the request of her mother Jennifer that they take her instead . As the hoods left , they demanded a $2.6 million ransom . <P> Suspicion immediately fell upon members of the Irish Republican Army , which has staged numerous similar kidnapings . The somewhat amateurish nature of the crime , however , could suggest the work of common criminals . By week 's end no word had been heard from the abductors.
