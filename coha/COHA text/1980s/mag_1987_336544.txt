From the facade of the normally austere 17-story Ministry of International Trade and Industry in the heart of Tokyo dangled a huge white banner last week . In bold calligraphy it exhorted passersby : LET US SHAKE HANDS WITH NATIONS OF THE WORLD BY IMPORTING MORE GOODS . In his 13th-floor office , Hiroshi Sugiyama , head of MITI 's Bureau of Industrial Policies , echoed the spirit of the banner . " To Japan , " he said , " the economic priority is not kyoso ( ( competition ) ) but kyocho ( ( conciliation ) ) with the rest of the world . " <P> This from the government whose rallying cry has long been " Export or Die " ? Does this mean that Japan , the world 's most fearsome economic competitor , is ready to roll down its sleeves and relax while its rivals carve up its slice of the global market ? Not exactly . But Japan , under pressure to reduce a trade surplus that reached $83 billion last year , is indeed trying to soothe foreign critics by curbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trade turnaround was a long time coming , but there are finally some signs of change . Between 1982 and 1986 , the value of Japanese exports jumped from $138 billion to $211 billion , partly because of the yen 's 50% rise against the dollar . In 1986 alone , Japan 's trade surplus rose 79% from the previous year . But last spring it began to come down . By July the surplus was nearly 15% lower than the same month the year before . Meanwhile imports , spurred by growing domestic demand for ever cheaper foreign goods , were up 30% in August , compared with that month of 1986 . <P> The adjustment has not been easy . In such basic industries as shipbuilding , textiles and small electronics , Japan began losing customers to South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore . Many Japanese firms had to cut production and sacrifice profits to remain competitive . Mazda , for example , saw its net earnings drop 77% in the six months ending April 30 , compared with the same period a year earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. <P> The yen crisis forced manufacturers to change tactics . To reap the benefits of lower wages along the Pacific Rim , many Japanese firms built new factories offshore . Matsushita , the world 's largest consumer electronics manufacturer , makes motors in Malaysia , batteries in Indonesia and facsimile machines in Singapore . Sony plans to move one-third of its production out of Japan by 1990 . <P> Japan 's automakers , which voluntarily limit exports to the U.S. to 2.3 million cars a year , are rapidly shifting production to American shores in hopes of dousing the protectionist sentiments that continue to simmer in the U.S. Congress . Many firms are finding an added benefit : it is now cheaper to build cars in Ohio than in Osaka . By the early 1990s , at least 14 Japanese plants in the U.S. could be turning out 2 million cars a year .
