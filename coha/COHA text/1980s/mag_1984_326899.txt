The " other horse " in Woody Stephens ' barn takes the Derby <P> By Woody Stephens out of the hospital , a second-string horse , Swale , won the Kentucky Derby last week for Claiborne Farm and Trainer Stephens , for Mrs. A.B . Hancock Jr . and her son Seth , for the late Bull Hancock in a manner and for the lost Devil 's Bag in a way . Throughout 109 prior Derbys , no healthy favorite had ever been scratched , but the Bag literally could not afford to lose . Syndicated for $36 million as a two-year-old of monstrous breeding promise , he was dropped from destiny 's consideration on the basis of a victory in the Derby trial that was not victorious enough . His training associate , Swale , Stephens ' second favorite three-year-old , was left to carry on . He did so , by 3 lengths over a perfect stranger to everyone , Coax Me Chad . <P> Drama in several forms was centered at Claiborne , whose master , Seth Hancock , had been the syndicator of Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . As Devil 's Bag 's form was declining , Swale was winning the Florida Derby , and Hancock was caught between a frown and a smile . Meanwhile , Stephens fell ill from emphysema , compounded by a rib-rattling fall and exasperated by the collapse of the special horse . " Devil 's Bag just never found himself this year , " murmured Stephens , 70 , who was furloughed from the hospital to watch Swale in person . Looking small and wan , dappled old Woody said with the brave gleam of all winning trainers , " I thought he was a cinch , anyway . " A son of 1977 Triple Crown Champion Seattle Slew , Swale favors that great dark bay . <P> Laffit Pincay , Swale 's jockey and Willie Shoemaker 's idea of the best rider of the present day , had been second three times in the Derby , starting when Sham chased Secretariat eleven years ago . " I thought I was destined never to win it , " he said . Sham had been Bull Hancock 's best hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluegrass history , died that year . He bred Derby winners , but never owned one . " It 's about time , " said a lovely woman with white hair , his widow . <P> Women were central figures in this Derby ; it fizzed with equal opportunity . For the only time in 110 years , the pageant involved a female owner , trainer , jockey , horse and Governor . A filly entry of Althea and Life 's Magic was the 5-to-2 pick , Swale the 7-to-2 second choice . The No. 1 post position , while symbolic of Althea 's place as the first filly favorite in 49 years , constituted no honor . Waiting for 19 other horses to be loaded in the gate is hardship enough for any thoroughbred . But where three-year-old males are blithely ignorant of sexual affairs , a filly is eligible to " horse " at any time , to become distracted by spring . Whatever Althea 's excuse , she finished 19th . The lady rider , Patti Cooksey , brought So Vague home a deserving eleventh , just ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One woman in the winner 's circle was a certainty though . As she proudly pointed out , Governor Martha Layne Collins was the first of her sex to dispense the trophy . <P> - By Tom Callahan
