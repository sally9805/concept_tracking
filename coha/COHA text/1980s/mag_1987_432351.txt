 | BEHOLD THE BRAZILIAN whooping crane : Roberto Gaspar de Oliveira , wealthy landowner , an endangered species , and a man struggling to contain his fury . It was his land . His land , you must understand . An undeveloped part of his family property in the northeastern state of Ceara was to be taken away under a new agrarian-reform act and divided among landless peasants . The government would pay for it , but the terms were unacceptable to Gaspar . He had demanded that federal mediators examine the case . I met Gaspar in Fortaleza , capital of Ceara . He was a tall , rather engaging businessman , boyish at 34 , with dark-framed glasses , shiny black hair , and good manners . But his color rose quickly as he talked of his land , and his fingers tapped an indignant staccato on the tabletop . " My tenants have been incited by the church , " he said . " They want to be the owners of the land now ! The padre told them the land belongs to God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fruit ! " Gaspar clearly felt the victim , betrayed by the institutions that had nurtured him . " If this mediation fails , " he said , " we 're going to arm ourselves and defend what we have . We 're going to make war ! " He stood up to his considerable height . " I 'm very macho , " he said without a hint of self-mockery . " And I 'm not afraid of any government or any progressive church ! " The privilege and influence of the Brazilian landowner-politician , backbone of the nation since colonial times , has been withering for decades . Big-city corporations have become the landowners of power . And now agrarian reform has shaken rural Brazil by the scruff . Tenant farmers are demanding their due , and Brazil 's new civilian government , installed in 1985 after 21 years of right-wing military rule , has begun to give them hope . All across the nation there is a shedding of the authoritarian skin . Democracy is afoot . Brazilians are proud to be Brazilians again . Political exiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voice . For Brazil , emerging into the First World of nations , now is a moment of promise . At the Rio de Janeiro offices of FUNABEM , Brazil 's juvenile-welfare agency , director Ana Filgueiras was aglow with possibilities . " There 's tremendous excitement , " she told me . " Big , big optimism ! Brazil was a country ruled by people ( how can I say it in a soft way ? ) without morals , who stole money . The big change in Brazil is that the government will now listen to the needs of society . " It would be a change indeed . There has never been a solid democratic tradition in Brazil , a nation that has tried to sustain technological growth and feudalism in the same century . The gap between rich and poor , educated and ignorant , has widened to tragic proportions . Eighty percent of the land is held by only 5 percent of the people . Twenty million Brazilians labor at a minimum wage of less than $60 a month . A fourth are jammed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random threads , where thievery is no longer even confessed as a sin , and where heroes are often racketeers or dealers of cocaine . For the poor , government has meant only repression . Out of 138 million inhabitants of Brazil , as novelist Antonio Callado told me , " only a small group is living in this century and this time . " And yet Brazil has no history of mass violence or revolution . Change has always come from above ; popular movements have been quickly aborted . Slavery lasted until 1888 . Even military coups are bloodless . " Ours is a timid country , " Callado said wryly , " a bit of a bobo , a big fellow , but not really matured . " Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world ( map , pages 354-5 ) . It measures 4,300 kilometers ( 2,700 miles ) from the northern Amazon basin to Uruguay ? the distance from London to Tehran . Metropolitan Sao Paulo , an economic colossus , is practically a nation in itself . With 15 million inhabitants  | it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americas . Yet Brazil has no clear global role or duty . The Portuguese language isolates it from Spanish South America , and distance buffers it from the East-West tensions of the Northern Hemisphere . International affairs seem irrelevant . For the average Brazilian , as for the average American or Chinese , his own country is enough . Brazil 's worst enemy has been itself , but there is an underlying optimism here that recalls the United States of a hundred years ago , when the eastern cities were still wretched with immigrants and the Wild West beckoned to free men . Brazil , like the U. S. , is a nation of newcomers , and there is still room to grow ? and to make mistakes . It often teeters on the edge of an abyss , it is said , but never falls in . . . because Brazil is bigger than the abyss itself . FOR TWO DECADES Brazil 's military government virtually ignored the poor . It concentrated on building the national product , on the theory that you ca n't divide poverty , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generals invested in grandiose projects such as a nuclear power program and the Trans-Amazon Highway . They created Brazil 's " economic miracle " of the late 1960s , but the new wealth failed to trickle all the way down . Around each gleaming city remained a Calcutta of social misery . " Belindia , " worried intellectuals called their country ? half Belgium and half India . When rising interest rates and the oil crisis of the 1970s forced the nation into recession , the financial gains of the Brazilian middle class were eroded , and international bankers turned off the tap . In 1984 Brazil labored under a foreign debt of a hundred billion dollars , a sum so enormous that the nation 's trade surplus could barely pay the interest . The International Monetary Fund got tough , demanding monetary and fiscal austerity programs that humiliated Brazilians , kindled a backlash against international bankers , and finally helped drive the military from power . " Military ' is a dirty word now in Brazil , " one prosperous civil servant told me . " I know soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be seen . And children do n't brag to their schoolmates that their father is a general . " The new president , Jose Sarney , was an anticlimax . President-elect Tancredo Neves died in 1985 before he could be inaugurated , and Sarney , a low-key running mate with military connections , was elevated . The Sarney Administration talked a liberal game . It announced that the era of big projects was over , that the welfare of Brazilians was more important than the foreign debt , and that its goal would be social justice . Few believed it . The " new republic , " full of old faces , was met with skepticism . But Sarney resurrected agrarian reform , a measure passed in 1964 but largely neglected by the generals . And on February 28 , 1986 , in a surprise decree , he slapped a radical anti-inflation package on the nation ? the Cruzado Plan . He lopped three . zeroes off the cruzeiro currency and declared it the cruzado , froze prices and wages , and established Brazil 's first unemploymentcompensation program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor retail stores for illegal price hikes . Merchants slow to catch the spirit were jailed . Even Roberto Maksoud , owner of the fanciest hotel in Sao  | Paulo , the Maksoud Plaza , was arrested for inflating the price of soft drinks . Before the reform many Brazilians were content to live off financial speculation and inflated interest on savings accounts . " Here is the change , " a machine-shop owner told me : " Last month you could count on your fingers the number of people who thought that hard work would result in a better life ? that you could actually gain something by working . Now it 's just a step for them to believe that they can change the whole system . They will have the economic power , therefore the political power . " In a circus of expectation , I found Brazil 's @# most revered and irreverent economist , Maria da Conceicao Tavares . She gripped me by the shoulders in her Rio apartment and glared over her half-frame glasses , trailing cigarette smoke . " People do n't realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there is hope . This is the first moment in the history of Brazil that is not against the people , but against the bankers and the financial capitalists ! " By the end of 1986 the Cruzado Plan was into its second phase of adjustments . Demand had outdistanced supply . Farmers , accustomed to collecting higher and higher 357  | prices each year , withheld cattle and poultry from slaughter . Long lines formed at supermarkets just to buy eggs . Brazil was forced to import meat . Beset by an overheated economy , the administration raised some prices in November . Angry crowds stormed through Brasilia in protest . But inflation had fallen to 25 percent from 250 since the Cruzado Plan , while the economy had grown by 8 percent , among the highest rates in the world . ' Today , business is brisk again , lubricated by fallen oil prices and lower interest rates . And continued industrial success may give the Sarney government enough space to begin the social assault . " It 's the best thing that 's happened to Brazil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has brought a sense of nationalism not patriotism , not against anything ? but a sense of nationhood . " NATIONHOOD has offered little to the poor . In the past half century the search for a decent wage and a better life has meant immense migrations of people . They have fled the cycles of flood and drought in the northeast for the coastal cities . They have been lured by the economic promise of the south . And , in this decade , they have been enticed to the land of last resort ? Rondonia and the Amazon basin ? a wilderness of fearsome proportions and sudden disasters . My own three-month-long journey through Brazil took the same , almost circular route . Portuguese explorers first landed in Brazil in 1500 , not far from what is now the city of Salvador , in the state of Bahia . Salvador became Brazil 's colonial capital and remains its spiritual heart . Here is where the slave merchants discharged their sad cargoes for three centuries , where explorers and soldiers , Jesuits , and cattle ranchers staged their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations of northeast Brazil gradually found themselves captive to an exhausted land . In the past 40 years 3.5 million of them have fled . Those who remain in the sertdo , the interior , are mired in one of the most poverty-stricken areas in the Western Hemisphere . Half are illiterate ; most are malnourished . In Itapipoca , in Ceara , hundreds of families from the surrounding hills have sought refuge in mud-and-wattle huts on the outskirts of town . Fernando Silva Pontes , a physician and priest , rides the mountainous roads on a motorcycle . Sanitation , he told me , is the big problem . And food is scarce . " All they have is farinha and beans , and some mothers are too sick to supply milk , " National Geographic , March 1987  | he said . " In one house a baby was crying and crying . The mother was in tears . I told her to give the baby milk , but she did n't want to , and I almost forced her . And then I saw the baby suck blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from he sertao have migrated into Fortaleza , most elbowing into flood-prone riverbed slums . The mayor of Fortaleza , Maria Luiza Fontenele of the left-wing Workers Party , has the heart but not the funds to accommodate the influx . The conservative state government , petulant over the mayor 's victory last year , has declined to help . " Our problem is how to save the children , " she told me wearily at her home one night . " Fortaleza has one of the highest infant mortality rates in Latin America . Two out of ten kids die before the age of one . " Since the early 1960s , clerics like Bernardo Holmes , a priest who lives in a Fortaleza slum , have picked up where governments have faltered . They have helped organize grass roots groups among the poor , and they have advocated peasants ' rights , often with the lexicon of Marxism . " Right now there 's freedom in the air , " Father Bernardo told me . " We are n't needed as much . But in the 1970s we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before our eyes , and the traditional way of handing out alms did n't solve anything . " The Brazilian government , however , has seen only subversion , and the Vatican has balked over the politics of this " liberation theology . " Brazilian clerics have been disciplined , and bishops called to Rome for papal ear bendings . Bernardo sees only compelling need . " The people in these shantytowns have come from the countryside after years of hard , grinding work , " he said . " Here they are out of their natural communities ? thrown into promiscuity , where all their values collapse and they lose their work ethic . It 's the bottom of the pit . " He took me to the city dump , where about 800 men , women , and children survive by picking through the garbage for recyclable cans , paper , and metal . The stench nearly overpowered me , but for Bernardo , with his red beard , T-shirt , and fatigue pants , it was routine . He comes here , he said , " to chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson in liberation theology . I learned the meaning of hell . Hell is when you are eight years old and you @#  | compete side by side with vultures for food . Hell is when you face bulldozers pushing ten-foot-high mounds of rancid , dripping garbage , and you must wade into it , kneedeep , clawing for tin cans or pieces of tomato . Hell is when you do this every day . And when it seems normal ? when you are eight . IN BAHIA , where the powerful black culture of the African took hold and came to dominate Brazil , there was a military encampment called Favela , named for a local cactus , that was razed in the war of 1897 between rebels and soldiers of the new Brazilian republic . The survivors , homeless and facing an uncertain future , moved south and added to Brazil 's great immigration to the cities . Favela lent its name to the shantytowns that formed around cities like Belo Horizonte , Rio de Janeiro , and Sao Paulo . In these favelas you will still find entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically transplanted . In the past decade the favelas of Rio have organized effective associations to press for electricity and sanitation . As more favelados gain title to their land , they are willing to improve their homes ; cinder block and brick are replacing sheet metal and cardboard . And if the favelas are not yet prosperous , they are at least free .  | Freedom is the Rio intoxicant . Nothing is savored more in this sensuous city of party lights and brighter hopes , a city perpetually forgiven and blessed by the towering statue of " Christ the Redeemer , " who stretches His arms from the summit of Corcovado , one of the sharp , dark peaks that define the shape of Rio . Rio remains one of the world 's most glamorous tourist destinations , especially during Carnival , the pre-Lenten celebration of the flesh . Carnival was once a purely European tradition , but in Rio it has been co-opted by the poor and black . Parades of favelados press their way through fashionable streets with an almost disturbing power and momentum : wiry black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument called the cuica ; transvestites in lingerie and fishnet hose ; and a nucleus of tightly packed , strutting young men venting a year 's worth of frustration . For four days they rule Rio . " Twenty years ago we danced in the streets , " said a middle-aged woman who lives in the prosperous neighborhood of Urca . " Now it 's the lower classes . It 's changed . We leave town during Carnival , drive to the country . There is an exchange of people . " This " carnival of democracy , " as the 1986 celebration was labeled , quickly reverted to parody and satire . Once again the government could be safely lampooned . Even the United States was vilified in the elaborate parades of clubs called escolas de samba from Rio 's poor neighborhoods . Uncle Sam shared one float with an exploited Brazilian worker wearing only a barrel . " I am the Rio canary , " sang the Caprichosos de Pilares group , " and the American eagle will not close my beak . " More disconcerting to some Cariocas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the accurate timing of Carnival events , in a city where most appointments are treated only as suggestions . " Carnival was run on Swedish time this year , " my guide and colleague Tete Moraes complained . " A lot of my friends were quite angry . Why , they said , was Carnival organized , and not housing or the economy or agriculture ? If we 're going to start organizing , why start with Carnival ? " IT IS KNOWN that somewhere in the center city , commerce grinds on through these madcap days , and businessmen still toss down their 20 shots of black coffee , the ubiquitous cafezinhos , with their paperwork . But most of Rio is on the beach . Soccer fields and chinning stations stretch along the five-kilometer crescent of Copacabana . Dark young men with tight stomachs play foot volley : volleyball with no hands , only soccer rules . The tanga bikini , not outrageous enough for this season , has given way to the fio dental , the dental floss . And the " girl from Ipanema ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's Miss Ipanema pageant , " said the man who wrote the song , Antonio Carlos ( Tom ) Jobim . " For me Ipanema has become a nightmare , " he added wistfully at his whitewashed hillside home . " The other day there were a million people there . That is crazy ! It 's like Coney Island in 1948 . Forty years ago it was a paradise ? just a strip of sand , a desert . And the fish were so big we were afraid to dive into the water . " The main beaches are now polluted , and an urban haze obscures the stars , but the evenings still shine with a soft , pastel luminescence . On the beach at Sao Conrado you can watch hang gliders settle like butterflies from the overhanging bluff . And lovers still sit pressed together , waiting for the offshore islands to melt into darkness . The beach is democratic , everyone likes to say , but special groups have staked out their own sections . Surfers , intellectuals , bureaucrats , teenyboppers , all know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus it was that beach society was disrupted when the populist governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro , Leonel Brizola , set up bus route No. 461 . For the first time , poor black families from the north side had direct access to the affluent beaches in the south . Much of the resentment has been racial , for the nation 's unspoken caste system is rigid and pervasive . Society 's top echelons are almost exclusively white . Sometimes even the Portuguese are disparaged as a sort of swarthy , inferior brand of European . " There is a certain regret that the Dutch did n't stay in Brazil , " said Antonio Callado , referring to a brief period of colonization in the 1600s . " It 's a feeling that we are @#  | backward because we were n't colonized by fair people . It 's something fundamentally weak and disgusting ? trying to explain away why we do n't do things . " Very few Brazilians could prove they do n't have Negro blood . We look at faces here . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black skin , you 'd better be Pele ; otherwise you 'll suffer for it . " The ambitious Governor Brizola , champion of the poor , built more than 50 critically needed schools for favela children , only to be accused of political grandstanding . " He 's ruined the city , " said one Carioca matron . " He appeals to young boys who steal watches . Everything 's decaying in Rio . The streets are full of holes . We 've never had so many beggars , so many assaults . " And , " she said , hurling the ultimate insult , " he is not even a Carioca ! " Orderly times were badly shaken by the recession of 1981 . Crime swept darkly over Rio and the other large cities of Brazil and rippled to the doorsteps of the rich . The jobless , without an adequate federal socialwelfare net , took to the streets in desperation . On the beaches , on the sidewalks of Copacabana , families living in cardboard boxes slept overnight in dark corners . In Urea , residents got extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their streets against thieves . A woman named Vera Castelo Branco told me this story : " In the bus a man came up to me and said , Give me your ring or I will kill you . ' No one moved to help me . I gave it  | to him . When he slipped out , I thought the people would be sympathetic . But they were mad at me . Why should we be responsible for you ? ' they asked . Everyone knows you ca n't carry jewelry in the bus . ' " Brazil 's more tragic social dilemma is the millions of children who are simply abandoned in the streets , living in gangs , sleeping under bridges , surviving by petty crime . " I think this is the worst problem in Brazil , " said Emir Sader , a counselor for the president of FEBEM , Sao Paulo 's juveniledetention system . " The most scandalous of a country full of scandals . Every day 130 boys arrive here . The police beat them to make them confess to crimes they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not very democratic , and not strong enough to fight the police , " said Sader , smiling grimly at my discomfort . " We think the police kill one child each day in Sao Paulo . " " Would n't the press publicize these things ? " I demanded . " It 's normal , " he said , " not news . If somebody could stop this , then it would be news . " In the six months after the Cruzado Plan was decreed , 160,000 new jobs were created in metropolitan Sao Paulo , perhaps sparing some children the barbarism of the streets . SAO PAULO is the engine that drives Brazil 's raw capitalism . Its growth from seven million to 15 million people in 20 years has been swift and unsentimental . It has absorbed nearly two million migrants from the northeast alone . Along the imposing and stylish concreteand-glass lined Avenida Paulista , you can still glimpse a few garden-mansions of the wealthy coffee growers who once ruled the city ; but do n't blink . Sao Paulo 's high-rise towers march across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corporate buildings line the highways ? Yamaha , Siemens , Johnson &; Johnson , Scania , Quaker . Boxlike apartments perched on concrete stilts , with parking space underneath , accommodate Brazil 's best paid workers . The city center sets nerves jangling with its honking traffic , acrid air , and hammering construction . But the fine arts flourish , and university scholars are honored and heeded . And business gives the city an international dimension .  | The Maksoud Plaza is crowded with three-piece suits from the nations of the world , filled with sleek men spearheading , consolidating , scheming , and selling over power lunches . The restaurant offers " American coffee , " a minor heresy . Today Brazil has much to sell . It produces armored vehicles and candy bars , orange juice and computers , surgical supplies and mahogany , bombs and ballpoint pens , rockets to launch its own satellites . Even coffee . It produces 95 percent of its needs . Brazil is a world leader in iron ore production and hydroelectricity . Brazilian business , engineering , and construction now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China . Brazilian engineers are laying out streets in Nigeria . Brazilian shoes fill American shops . TV Globo , the world 's fourth largest television network , exports soap operas to Europe . The Brazilian mining company Vale do Rio Doce has successfully developed the world 's largest reserve of high-quality iron ore in the mountainous jungle of the Amazon basin . And in ten short years Brazil has vaulted into the international aeronautics and arms market with a range of weaponry from grenades to jet fighters . By some accounts Brazil is the fifth largest exporter of  | arms in the world , after the U. S. , the Soviet Union , Britain , and France . And Brazil was the only nation to switch successfully from gasoline to a renewable resourcesugarcane-based ethanol ? for automobile fuel when the oil crisis hit . More than 90 percent of new Brazilian-made cars use it . BRAZIL 'S agricultural output , too , remains immense . It trails only the United States in the export of food . All the more astonishing , then , that the nation 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed its people . Traditional food crops such as beans and corn have been supplanted by sugarcane for ethanol and export crops like soybeans that help pay the foreign debt . Farm workers have lost their subsistence gardens as owners have pushed the newly profitable crops to the far edges of their properties . Mechanization has deprived other thousands of a living . Many people whose families have farmed the same land for generations have been forced out . Twelve million rural families are landless , but 40 percent of private or government property remains underdeveloped . Agrarian reform works on a simple principle : The government , through an agency called INCRA , intends to buy that land and subdivide it among those who need it . But the reform cuts to the heart . Violence has rattled across the nation between pistoleiros , henchmen of recalcitrant landowners , and defiant peasants . At least 130 people died in land conflicts in 1986 alone . Agrarian reform foot-dragged its way through its first year , with INCRA reacting only on a crisis-by-crisis basis . But on May 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shot in the back in the town of Imperatriz , in Maranhao . He was the fourth church activist , including two nuns , to be murdered in the past two years . His death was the final catalyst . Two weeks later , under heavy pressure from the church , the president signed seven of the 23 state agrarian-reform plans into law . The program is a watered-down version of the original goal of resettling 10.6 million families by the turn of the century . Now 1.4 million are to be resettled in four years . Agrarian reform is the riskiest , and the most important , challenge for the popular new administration . Despite the selfdefeating fact that most politicians are also wealthy landowners , it must work . The alternative is violence . 369  | For now the landless seem content to protest . Between the lush soybean fields of Rio Grande do Sul , some 8,000 peasants of German and Italian stock have been entrenched for 17 months in a squatters camp of scrap lumber and plastic sheets on the edge of the Annoni estate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9,150 hectares ( 22,600 acres ) were marked for expropriation here , but the case has since been tied up in the courts . Owner Bolivar Annoni sees red . " It 's a criminal invasion that the government supports , " he told me in the state capital of Porto Alegre . " It 's Communist infiltration . People from Cuba and Nicaragua . They are armed , and in a short time they will also have heavy machine guns . " With some trepidation , I drove to Ronda Alta next day with journalist Tete Moraes . The road crosses the pampas , a flatland of pasture and eucalyptus trees where gauchos still keep their leathery grip on the popular imagination . But southern Brazil today is more a tropical Europe , the most prosperous region in the nation . Trucks thunder past with soybeans and wheat . Some carry cattle that slosh in the swaying double trailers like liquid , on their way to the grills of churrascaria ? barbecue restaurants .  | Padre Arnildo Fritzen , whose church shepherds the landless in Ronda Alta , offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-clay roads between the fields we flew in his Volkswagen . " The soy culture is supported by the banks , " said the padre from under his straw hat . " The colonos , the peasants , are left out . Until the arrival of soy , the farmers could manage to buy new land for their sons . Twenty years ago the small farmer produced . Here there was no problem with food . But look ! All is soy ! " The mood of the Annoni camp was a mix of sadness and smoldering resolve . Cuban machine guns were conspicuously absent . " The people here are simple rural workers , " said Padre Fritzen . " If you talk about Communism , they will be frightened . They are only people trying to get justice ? a piece of land to farm . " A volunteer doctor visits the site every few weeks , but the water from the only stream is questionable , and seven women and four children have already died . Diarrhea and conjunctivitis are rampant . " Why not go to Rondonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know the unemployment is already big in the cities , " said Darcy Maschio , 27.  | " We are sons of small farmers . We have no other profession . " Two days later 200 protesters from the Annoni camp occupied the eighth floor of the INCRA building in Porto Alegre . In an agreement battered out at four in the morning , they were promised land in 60 days . They left . A year of protest marches and hunger strikes has passed , and INCRA finally controls the Annoni land , but the colonos are still waiting . That night , returning late to our hotel in the heart of Porto Alegre , we heard loud voices singing beneath an underpass ? a family guarding their wooden stand of herbs and medicines . A man with a beaten face took me aside . " We came from the country , " he said , " but life has not been generous with my family . And I like to drink . But I 'm very worried about my wife , who now is living with a marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife . " Take this , " he said , handing me several herbs . " This is for the heart , and this is good for syphilis . This is to settle your stomach . Yes . I 've cured doctors , you know . " I took them all , and slept better for it . And I wondered which I would do if I were a dispossessed farmer ? sleep under a bridge ... or head straight for Rondonia.  | IF YOU LAID A STRING across an acre of grass and visualized it as a road , that would give you a good idea of Rondonia in the western Amazon , a new state seen as an escape valve for the nation 's social pressures . Rondonia symbolizes the westward migration of " our bravest , brightest , and best " ? a slogan of the late 1970s . But colonization moved slowly until 1984 , when the World Bank financed the paving of BR-364 through Rondonia to its capital of Porto Velho .

From Cuiaba , in Mato Grosso , a city booming as the staging area for Rondonian settlement , we reached only the fringe of the rain forest by nightfall . Majestic and ethereal trees floated overhead in silhouette , and our windshield became an insect graveyard ,  | nearly opaque in the glaring headlights of oncoming logging trucks . In the Rondonian border town of Vilhena , Caetano V. Neto ran the state immigration center , where as many as 30 busloads arrive each night from southern states like Parana and Minas Gerais , and nervous immigrants line up for mandatory yellow fever shots .

" INCRA began by parceling a hundred hectares of virgin forest to stout-hearted homesteaders , but it now has a waiting list of 20,000 families . It has suspended registration , but thousands continue to pour in . " Rondonia has become a dumping ground for the unwanted , " said Caetano . " In many towns in southern Brazil mayors lease trucks , give 200 cruzados and some farinha to each person , and send them to Rondonia . That solves their social problems but makes it worse here . One bus came with men chained up inside . They filled these guys with cachaca sugarcane liquor and just stuck ' em in . So much for your bravest , brightest , and best .

The new state of Acre on Brazil 's westernmost edge may be next . A paved road is under construction between Porto Velho and Acre 's capital of Rio Branco . But Acre has even less infrastructure for immigrants , and 8,000 forest Indians urgently need to be protected by reservations . Rondonia is overburdened , says Governor Angelo Angelin , who is lobbying in Brasilia to slow the colonization campaign . " You can not play with human lives , " state government advisor Marcio Raposo Dias told us in Porto Velho . " This is a state that has an absolutely hostile climate ? this is Amazonia . We have six months of rain ? just plain rain ? when the rivers will swell to four or five times normal . And many of these immigrants who arrive have the general idea of Rondonia as open fields , open lands , like their homes . " We waited the next night in Vilhena for the first Cuiaba bus and met Silvio Ferreira de Abreu and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hope .

You  | ca n't find decent work in Minas . I expect to go to INCRA and to find my uncle , who 's here . He says it 's good here . We got the news that land is available . " From the heights of Vilhena the wilderness stretches north in a ragged stubble , hazy with the smoke of sawmills and burning forest . But civilization holds the highway in a tender and tentative grip . Humpbacked zebu cattle graze around the charred stumps of new pastures , boys wearing team uniforms play soccer on an emerald field , and small but proud farmhouses already nestle in fruit trees and flowers .

Five times Texas would fit neatly into the Brazilian part of the Amazon basin . Brazilians consider the Amazon a sort of national warehouse where their future is locked , and while they fumble for the key , they fear that the rest of the world eyes their green treasure with plunderous intentions . The military government , acting on this touchy nationalism and fending off a leftist insurgency that used the forests for sanctuary , built the Trans-Amazon Highway in the 1970s , intending to settle five million colonists south of the main stem . The enterprise floundered . The dirt highway was virtually impassable in the rainy season , and today at least a third of the roadway has been reclaimed by the forest . Loggers , miners , and cattle ranchers have prospered , but for many poor farmers the 378 BRAZIL GOVERNS ITSELF from afar . Its capital city of Brasilia was created in a thousand days out of nothing , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1960 , fulfilling the dream of President Juscelino Kubitschek . Brasilia was the first reach into the interior , to pry the nation from the coast . The character of Brasilia falls somewhere between a sculpture garden and a lunar colony . Its creators , architect Oscar Niemeyer , city planner Lucio Costa , and landscape artist Roberto Burle Marx , fashioned a capital shaped like an airplane , with the business district in the center , living blocks in the wings , and the head of government in the cockpit . There is an alien sense of space and proportion , as if a normal city had come apart and its pieces were wandering . As an international capital , Brasilia springs odd surprises at the visitor . At the hotel swimming pool one afternoon I found a group of young people lounging and sunning . They were too pale , and just a bit too 383  | graceful . They were the Bolshoi Ballet Company from Moscow . But in this navel of the country , Brazil 's self-absorption is even more evident . The outside world seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and diplomats shuttle back and forth to Rio or Sao Paulo on weekends . And Brasilia has not escaped the nation 's social curse . The city was planned for 600,000 people , but now the area has 1.6 million . The workers who nailed and riveted the city together never returned to their northeast origins , but their fate was not in the blueprints . Today many people live in suburban favelas , sometimes called " antiBrasilias , " with poor sanitation , kilometers from the city . Their lives are so bleak that some reportedly took to poaching and eating animals from the city zoo . The military governments let Brasilia turn a bit seedy , and the Sarney government has invited Brasilia 's three designers to return and revitalize their capital . They are old but still vigorous , and they have tackled their dream with a new commitment . And so too has the government of Brazil , perhaps the first in many years to recognize and attempt to heal the great rift between it and the people . I spoke in Brasilia with Joao Sayad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cruzado Plan . " If we want a democracy , we have to build in the social area very rapidly , " he said , " and now we have the means . Our technical , economic , and industrial capabilities show we can get there . It 's only a problem of organization and political will . " Perhaps this is the time of promise for Brazil , when , as economist Conceicao Tavares put it , " we can begin to be civilized . " I remembered the words of novelist Antonio Callado : " I do n't know of any important nation that has n't gone through a moment of pain and suffering . Here , ideas are still superficial . The moment when people start thinking that ideas are important ? something that you 're ready to die for ? that moment has n't happened yet in Brazil . " Not yet . But there were the priests and peasants who had died for ideas . And there was that old man who had been working at the dump in Fortaleza for 15 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the land . He had an idea . " Where do you come from ? " I asked him . " Itapipoca . " " And which do you prefer ? " " Here , " he answered . " In Itapipoca I was a cativo , a slave . Here I am free . "
