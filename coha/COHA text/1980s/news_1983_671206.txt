" Security spending is as strong as ever with the Ayatollah on the rampage , " a salesman says. // The picture of business as usual that such anecdotes suggest about the mood here is also true of the rest of the Gulf states .

And Kuwait is budgeting $10. 5 billion in Government spending this year , unchanged from 1982. // If oil revenues fall short of spending goals , both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait say they will use income from their huge financial investments abroad to plug the gap . Saudi Arabia has at least $170 billion invested around the world , which yields it perhaps $15 billion a year . Kuwait has about $100 billion to shield it from oil price fluctuations. // Tiny Qatar , with a population of just 200 , 000 , is also pressing ahead with development plans . Last week it presented plans to spend between $4 billion and $6 billion over the next six years to develop a liquefied natural gas exporting business based on its huge offshore North Field reserves . <> <> U.A.E.

But this 34 percent decline in revenues came on a 45 percent fall in oil output , to roughly 7. 5 million barrels a day , from 13. 6 million barrels . To offset the impact of a $4 drop in the oil price now , to $30 a barrel from $34 , the Gulf states would need to increase volume by only about 15 percent , the bank notes. // " If prices do fall in 1983 , but production is restored , then many would generate higher revenues , " the bank review says .

" It is logical for them to put less of their own money into projects now and take more credit , " says Khaled al-Fayez , general manager of the Gulf International Bank in Bahrain. // As examples of this developing trend , he points to a recent $300 million syndicated credit by the Government of Bahrain to finance a new petrochemical plant and a planned borrowing by the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation to pay for new industrial investments .

They now have almost all the roads , schools , hospitals and ports they can use and , increasingly , are spending on industrial projects instead. // In turn , some of these industrial projects are now being delayed or stretched out because of the general economic uncertainty . It is relatively easy for the Gulf states to do this , bankers and businessmen say , because the only people to suffer are usually foreign minority shareholders . Several big Japanese companies involved in the new Saudi Arabian petrochemical complex at Yanbu , for example , are reportedly furious over project delays imposed by the Saudis. // In making spending decisions , Gulf governments do not need to worry about the consequences for local employment . In all of these countries , imported workers - chiefly from India , Pakistan and other poorer Middle East countries - greatly outnumber citizens , often three to one .

Development // But the oil glut is also stimulating a new debate in the Gulf over whether to invest oil income at home or abroad . The outcome of the debate could have an important impact on Western companies operating in this area. // Kuwait , for example , has spurned the Saudi Arabian policy of building up vast petrochemical works at home with foreign assistance in favor of direct overseas investment. // Its biggest such move recently has been the acquisition of Gulf Oil ' s Rotterdam refinery and a string of 750 service stations in Belgium , Luxembourg and Holland for an undislosed price . The acquisition makes Kuwait the first member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boast a fully-integrated oil industry of its own , extending from desert oil wells to retail gasoline pumps in Europe. // Kuwaiti officials say they now believe that , at a time of a glut , oil producing countries must tie up their own market outlets in the consuming world .
