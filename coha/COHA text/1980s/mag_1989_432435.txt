 | Victoria Principal will never forget the day in 1975 when she shocked the official at the Screen Actors Guild headquarters by marching into his office and defiantly tearing her membership card into confetti . Announcing she would never act again , the young actress then turned on her heels and walked out . Looking back on that little scenario 14 years ago , Victoria now says that the decision was a red-letter day in her life . " I was so desperately unhappy I had no trouble reaching the decision to stop being an actress , " she recalls . " It was a ceremonial act to really separate myself from the past . I felt as long as I was in front of the camera , I would n't have the courage to change into the kind of person I hoped to be . " She has since transformed herself into " that kind of person " with a vengeance . Today , Victoria , 39 , is one of the most  | in-demand producer/actresses in the entertainment business ? a quantum leap from the unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actors Guild . She is sitting on top of the world with her own production company and several TV movies and her own series in preparation . As we talked , Victoria sat behind her desk in a Beverly Hills office building , the picture of success . Dressed in an " executive chic " black Armani suit , she also wore a silver X she described as a " kiss from my husband , " Harry Glassman , a prominent Beverly Hills reconstructive surgeon . It is hard to believe that Victoria has been stalked by adversities of one kind or another ever since she was injured in a near-fatal car crash in Florida when she was an 18-year-old college freshman . That accident changed her life . " At an age when most kids have no sense of mortality , I felt the cold shadow of death , " she says . " I decided from then on I would go full out for everything I wanted in life . " Why , then , did she quit a promising acting career in 1975 ? At the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started at the top of the movie scale after only a few months in Hollywood and she found herself drifting downward ? fast . She had won her first film assignment when she was just 21 . " Director John Huston was looking for an actress to play a Mexican girl in Judge Roy Bean opposite Paul Newman . So I went into his office barefoot , wearing an old Mexican dress . I spoke a little Spanish . " Huston and Newman agreed Victoria was right for the part , and she joined the cast for location filming in Benson , Ariz . Victoria admits she virtually hibernated after each day 's shooting was over . " We 're all concerned about you , " producer John Foreman told her . " Do n't you want to mix and have dinner with the others ? " The truth was that she was afraid . " I thought that if I appeared off the set , I 'd be fired because after seeing the dailies , Mr. Huston would say I was n't any good and would get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous wreck . " When she learned that her footage was so impressive that Huston had expanded her modest part , " I felt wonderful , " Victoria remembers . " Now I believed I could go out to dinner with the others . " Although Victoria 's film debut was a success , Judge Roy Bean fell short of expectations at the box office . Soon after , Victoria made The Naked Ape . " That movie almost ruined my career , " she says . " It was worse than terrible . The popcorn was better than the picture ! It was a Playboy-Universal co-production , and part of the deal was that I pose nude for Playboy Magazine . I still regret that . When I signed the contract I did n't fully realize what I was getting into . But I was too frightened not to do it . " After some TV work , I thought my career was n't going in the right direction . I just was n't happy so I decided to move to the beach , 60 miles from Hollywood , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found this old house and fixed it up myself . " Victoria began putting on weight at an alarming speed . " I got fat , " she says flatly . " I did n't leave the house . During 1973-74 I ate my way out of the business . " When I did get back to my normal size , I returned to Beverly Hills and immediately got parts in l Will . . . I Will . . . For Now and Vigilante Force . It was then I decided I could no longer be an actress . I was n't succeeding as a performer ? or personally . I was a mess . There was no significant man in my life . How could there be ? Anyone with taste could n't have cared for me  | because I did n't care for myself . That 's when I tore up my card at the Screen Actors ' Guild . " But Victoria can trace her insecurities further back than 1975 . As the daughter of retired Air Force Major Victor Principal and the former Ree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , one state to another , attending 17 different schools . " Not having roots worked in my favor in the long run , but when I was living it , I felt it was a minus because I had no sense of permanence or belonging . I felt alienated and lonely . On the other hand , it made me tougher . " Victoria and her sister , Kim , were far enough apart in age ( Kim is 12 years younger ) for each girl to grow up feeling an only child . Victoria had another crucial asset : She was always exceptionally beautiful . After recovering from the Florida auto crash , she moved to New York to become a model . " Modeling was simply a way to pay the rent so I could study acting , " she explains . But she was quickly made aware that her body was too shapely for the superthin silhouettes then in vogue in the fashion industry . " Again I felt like an alien ? unwanted . " After only five months in New York she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more acceptable , to model for Oleg Cassini . But the fashion-house workers went on strike and she settled down in Switzerland for a time and then in England , where she studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts . She arrived in California in 1971 . To make a living she gave backgammon lessons . Then , her part in Judge Roy Bean came along . Victoria dated a variety of men , but there was no one special . She had never considered marriage as a career . When she abandoned acting , her exagent , Herb Schector , told her he thought she had a good business head and offered her a job as an agent . Victoria succeeded spectacularly in the job from 1975 to 1978 . " I loved making a deal , " she says with a foxy smile . " I 'd always been my own manager , and I enjoyed every minute of being an agent . My self-image improved . My wounds healed . " During this time , Victoria fell in love with a celebrated man . Their romance came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she still finds too painful to talk about . Nor does she wish to hurt him further by discussing his life . She will only say that she was brokenhearted , and had to pick up the pieces yet again . " Being an agent had answered a lot of questions for me but I had to get away to rest and think about the rest of my life , " she says . " I quit the agency and decided to go to law school . " She was accepted at a California college and searched for a part-time job to support herself . Before her first job interview , TV producer Aaron Spelling asked her to star in the pilot film for Fantasy Island . " Aaron asked how much my tuition would be for the first year , " she says . " Then he offered me that amount if I would do the pilot . During production I found myself enjoying acting . It was a revelation . After Fantasy Island I was asked to star in a TV movie , The Night They Stole Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back . I became an actress again . Then came Dallas . " A friend dropped off the script and said , Read this . You are Pam Ewing . ' " During her Dallas years , she married a young actor , Christopher Skinner , who was considerably younger than she . The marriage survived only a few months . Victoria made even more headlines with yet another younger man , singer Andy Gibb . Gibb , who had had a drug problem , died tragically in 1988 , several years after their romance  | had ended . " I tried to help him , " she said about their parting , " but there came a point in time where there was simply nothing I could do . " It was during the filming of Dallas that she met the most important man in her life , her husband , Harry , whom she married in 1985 . " I connected with Harry like I had never allowed myself to connect with a man before in my life , " Victoria says . " I am passionately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more jealous of him than he is of me . I love my work , but Harry is the higher priority . " Victoria says that , by choice , she will not have children . Harry has two grown offspring , Brooke and Andrew , who play important roles in her life . She thoroughly enjoyed playing Pam Ewing for five years , but by the seventh year found that the character just did n't have enough depth to plumb . " It took courage to leave after nine years . I knew the odds . Not many people finish a long , successful series and then go on to something else . So I purposely disappeared for two years . I was an absentee actress . " She spent those two years planning and organizing the TV films and series she wanted to do . The first big test was Mistress , a TV drama which won tremendous ratings and reviews . After that she began putting together deals for her own company , including the TV movie , Naked Lives . Currently Victoria is in the catbird seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall , but two made-for-TV movies : Sparks , in which she 'll play a politician whose career is jeopardized by a sexual indiscretion , and Nightmare , about a woman whose child is sexually abused ? which she will also produce . " The closest I 've ever felt to the high I 'm experiencing now was getting that part in Judge Roy Bean . Back then I stood in front of a mirror for an hour and a half waiting to change . Something so big and important was happening that I was young enough to believe a physical change would occur too ! " She smiles . " In a way , I 've been standing in front of that mirror for 18 years and I 'm finally seeing the change . " Only now it 's a deeper , more significant change than one of appearance . The actress has reshaped her life , personally and professionally , in a way that makes her immensely proud .                    @
