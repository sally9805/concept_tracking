Along Harlem 's 125th Street , the main artery of what was once the heart and soul of black America , a group of embittered black protesters demonstrates against the string of tidy Korean shops that now almost dominate the thoroughfare . In Miami , native blacks are beginning to feel like spurned foreigners as ambitious Cubans give the city a Latin rhythm and take over what were once bastions of black business . On the grim concrete playgrounds of Powelton Village in West Philadelphia , black children call their Asian classmates " chinks " and " gooks . " The Asians , quick learners all , call the blacks " spooks " and " niggers . " <P> Ever since the first slave ships unloaded their human cargo 360 years ago , black Americans have witnessed a succession of determined immigrants  --  Germans , Irish , Jews , Italians  --  weather discrimination to achieve a measure of acceptance and economic success that far surpassed their own . Once again the pattern is repeating itself . With a mixture of animosity and admiration , and no small dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia and Latin America flourish where blacks have not . Already the median household income of Koreans , Vietnamese , Haitians , Cubans and Mexicans has climbed past that of blacks . <P> Blacks tend to regard the immigrants as uninvited guests at a meager meal . Many believe the newcomers ' gains come at the expense of blacks and that a " racist " system benefits the immigrants . Adding to the bitterness is the black perception that America 's newest citizens are embracing one of its oldest traits , racial prejudice . Comedian Richard Pryor does a routine depicting a group of Indochinese boat people taking part in their first citizenship class . Lesson No. 1 : the correct pronunciation of the word nigger . <P> Underlying the tension is a difficult and sensitive question : Why have blacks failed to advance and achieve the way old and new ethnic groups have ? As Social Scientist Michael Harrington writes , " Why do n't ' they ' act like ' we ' did ? This has long been the cry of well-meaning white Americans who simply ca n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The answer , in part at least , is that the black experience in America has been unique . No other people came to America in chains . Unlike other groups that experienced spasms of prejudice that lasted a few decades , blacks have faced generations of racism . Indeed , they are among the oldest and newest Americans : old because they have lived in the U.S. since the time the nation was just an idea ; new because it has been only in the past 20 years that they have become truly enfranchised citizens . Says Economist Thomas Sowell : " The race as a whole has moved from utter destitution  --  in money , knowledge and rights  --  to a place alongside other groups emerging in the great struggles of life . None have had to come from so far back to join their fellow Americans . " <P> In reality , American blacks were immigrants , internal immigrants . Sowell notes in his book Ethnic America that from 1940 to 1970 4 million blacks  --  nearly one-fourth of all the 19th century European immigrants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poorest area of the country , to the urban North . Many of today 's urban blacks are only the second generation in the city , and their parents arrived at a time when the smokestack economy was spluttering.
