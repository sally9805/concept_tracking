 |p704  INDIA . How does this vast overpopulated subcontinent manage to run , and even to prosper ? For 130 years the chief reason has been the railway . Dusty and monumental , its trains often seem as ancient as India itself . In Pakistan they look like part of the landscape . An old reliable network of track brings hope to beleaguered Bangladesh . Much of Indian life is lived within sight of the tracks or the station , and often next to the tracks , or inside the station . The railway was one of the greatest imperial achievements of the British raj , and now , a larger system than ever in a subcontinent divided into sovereign nations , it still has the powerful atmosphere of empire about it . I had happy memories of the trains of India , and after a ten-year absence I wanted to return and to trace a line from the Khyber Pass in Pakistan , and through India , to Chittagong in Bangladesh , taking as many trains as possible . From the corner seat in a railway car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving east from the stony cliffs of the North-West Frontier in Pakistan , crossing Punjab and the valleys of the Indus , then cutting into India on an express , traveling up and down , linking the hill stations of Simla and Darjeeling with the long straight journeys of the plains ? via Delhi , the Taj Mahal , and the holy city of Varanasi on the Ganges . After Calcutta I could nip into Bangladesh to the end of the line ( map , page 747 ) . The statistics associated with Indian Railways are elephantine ( ten million passengers a day , 11,000 locomotives , 1.6 million workers ) , but the memorable details are simple enough : It is self-sufficient in rolling stock ? India manufactures all her own coaches and engines ? and it makes an operating profit of 12 percent revenue over expenditure . In many respects , India is one of the world 's greatest railway nations ? in total number of trains , stations , and longdistance travelers ; and also in a negative sense , with the most cockroaches , the greatest number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill out , and some of the dirtiest sleeping cars . In India the railway is not merely a way of going to and from work , but rather a solution to the complex demands of the family 's life . Birth , death , marriage , illness , and religious festivals all require witnesses and rituals that imply a journey home . I started in Pakistan , from Jamrud , a deserted station a short distance from Jamrud Fort , which , having been built in 1836 , is just ninety years older than the Khyber Railway . It was an early morning in July , and very hot ? the monsoon was weeks overdue . Once a week the Khyber train descends the 3,500 feet from the highest point of the Khyber Pass , carrying the refugees and travelers who can afford the seven-rupee ( 35-cent ) fare . The train is required to climb such steep inclines that it is powered by two steam engines ? one at the front and one at the rear of the five coaches ? both belching smoke and whistling as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once there was no trouble here , " a man told me as we clattered across the plain . " There was no water , no trees . Only small villages . Then a dam was built and water came to the valley in a stream , and since then there has been constant fighting . " Tempers were very bad . Months of drought had scorched the face of the land and made it so hot that people had moved out of their houses and set up their string beds under trees . Men sat on the banks of the trickling stream beside the railway tracks and chatted keeping their feet in the water . There were more than 35,000 people in the Kacha Garhi refugee camp , and nearly as many in the one at Nasir Bagh not far away . Driven from their homes in Afghanistan by the war , they lay in hammocks , they cooked under trees , they waited for the weekly shipment of food ; they watched the train go by . Across ten miles of gravel are the high gray-brown mountains that mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes its way across the dead land . This was always a tribal area , the people were always dressed like this , and always armed , the train was always pulled by smoking , screeching steam engines , and the nighttime noises were always human voices and the clopping hooves of the tonga ponies , and when ? hours late ? the train pulls into Peshawar Cantonment station , it is pitch dark and 110 ? F. Most people make straight for the bazaar . " This is the Qissa Khawani Bazaar , " said Ziarat Gul , a powerfully built and kindly soul who was known in Peshawar as " Gujjar ? Buffalo Man . " He was pointing at a labyrinth of alleys too narrow for anything larger than pony carts . " This means the Storytellers ' Bazaar . In the old times all the kafilas caravans came from Persia and Russia and Afghanistan , here to Peshawar . They told stories of their journeys . " Peshawar is once again a great destination . Now the travelers  |p707  are Afghan refugees , and the stories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are said to be more than three million refugees , and many of them bring goods and food to sell at the bazaar ? carpets and jewelry , embroidery , leatherwork , cartridge belts , pistol holders , rifle slings , almonds , dates , prunes , and fresh fruit . The bazaar has never been busier or more full of hawkers . Everywhere are the beaky , craggy faces of the travelers , turbaned men and shrouded women , rifles and pistols , and the tea drinkers huddled around samovars ? storytellers again . I OCCUPIED an air-conditioned compartment on the Khyber Mail , and in its grumbling way the machinery actually worked . I was soon traveling under a bright moon through Nowshera and across the Indus River at Attock . We passed through Rawalpindi and Jhelum , too , but by then I was asleep . Just before Wazirabad at dawn there was a knock on the door of my compartment . " You wanting breakfast ? " I could have been wrong , of course , but it seemed to be the same brisk man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had the same bad eye , the same dirty turban , the same lined face . And the breakfast was the same as well ? eggs , tea , bread on heavy stained crockery . Scattered showers of the monsoon had begun to appear . They darkened Lahore , once the princely city of Akbar and Shah Jahan , now the capital of Punjab . It was cooler here , and the rice fields had water in them ; planting had begun ; the grass was green . The soil was mostly clay , and so brickworks had sprung up , each one with a steeple-like chimney . Little girls , fully clothed , some looking as young as six or seven , were digging mud and clay out of pits for bricks and carrying it in baskets on their heads . Meanwhile ,  |p708  little boys played in the grass or swam in ditches . It appears the absurd custom of the country to require little girls modestly to remain clothed and do most of the laborious work , while naked boys can frolic all the livelong day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from Shandara station is one of Pakistan 's most glorious buildings , the Tomb of Jahangir , with its vast park ? grander than the Shalimar Gardens ? and the marble mausoleum inlaid with gems ; all of it in a perfect state of preservation . WHEN INDIA was partitioned in 1947 , so was the railway . but the trains did n't stop running until the 1965 IndoPakistani war . For 11 years the steel rails connecting Wagah in Pakistan with Atari , the Indian border town , were silent . And then in 1976 the trains began to run again . Very little had changed on this line ; the steam locomotives , like all steam locomotives in India , looked filthy , ancient , and reliable ; they are great sooty thunder boxes , and there are 7,245 of them still operating in India . The coaches were battered , and the train was very slow . This was the International Express . The train left on time , which surprised me , considering that the thousand or so people on board had all had their passports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain toward India . After an hour every man we passed wore a turban , the symbolic headpiece of the Sikhs . We were nearing Amritsar , spiritual capital of the Sikhs , and as practically all Sikhs are named Singh , we were among the great family of Singhs . Sikh is from the Sanskrit word shishya , meaning " disciple . " The Sikhs are disciples of a tradition of ten gurus , beginning with 15thcentury Guru Nanak , who taught monotheism , espoused meditation , and opposed the Hindu caste system . On the approaches to Amritsar , Sikhs herded goats , Sikhs dug in the fields , Sikhs processed the passengers on the International Express . At Atari station the operation took several hours : everyone ordered off the train , everyone lined up and scrutinized , everyone ordered back on . Then the whistle blew and the black smoke darkened the sky , and we proceeded into India . But it was not only black smoke in the sky . The clouds were the color of cast iron ; they were blue-black and huge . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain from the whiteness of the egrets ? they look whitest when rain is due and these dozens flying up from the paddies near Amritsar were brilliantly white against the dark clouds massing over us . We arrived just before one o'clock at Amritsar , and as our train pulled in , passing buffaloes and scattering the goats and ducks and children , the storm hit . It was the first rain of the monsoon ? pelting gray drops , noisy and powerful and , only minutes after it had begun , already erupting from drains and streaming under the tracks . The rain in its fury put the Indians into a good mood . It was the sunny days and blue skies ? intimations of drought ? that made them bad tempered . Because of the rain , only pedicabs were running in Amritsar . Automobiles lay stranded and submerged all over the inundated city . I sat inside , deafened by the rain , and studied the timetable ,
