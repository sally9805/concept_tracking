The principal appeal of these dishes is simple . A stuffing or filling offers a fine contrast both in texture and taste to the food into which it is put : a stuffed fowl with a chestnut and sausage filling , for example , or an eggplant filled with ham and cheese , or stuffed ravioli . Such foods sometimes have an additional allure - another contrast in flavor and texture - if served with a sauce based on tomato or cream. // Although these contrasts may sometimes be basic , that is not invariably the case . Some of the things into which stuffings are put are not even edible . Stuffed snails generally consist of the wholly edible mollusk inserted into a shell that would indeed , even if chewed , be difficult to swallow . The clam shell that serves as a basis for stuffed clams would be an equally tough item to get down. // The appeal of such stuffed foods has to do with flavors , of course , but is also visual . Have you ever considered how boring most snails would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sizzling garlic butter , the traditional sauce for snails ? And you have to admit that a platter of clams , stuffed on the half shell and served piping hot from the oven , would be far less tasty if served en casserole . It is more fun to eat snails in the shell - even if the " shells " are machine-made of porcelain. // What applies to snails and clams applies equally to lobster . I doubt that Escoffier , a highly cerebral man , ever gave serious consideration to why , in several of his recipes , he chose to stuff the lobster shell rather than serve the stuffing all lumped together in a large dish . He was well aware , of course , that the filling baked in a shell would be far more presentable - theatrical is not too strong word - than serving it otherwise . What ' s good for the eye can tempt the palate as well. // The list of international foods that achieve a greater appeal by being stuffed ranges from the Mexican tamale ( corn meal and meat stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Jewish kreplach , the Chinese won ton and the Siberian pelmeny , all of which are related , to Middle Eastern stuffed grape leaves and so on . The list is lengthy indeed . There are also the sweet or savory crepes of France , the Greek spanikopita or tyropita ( phyllo pastry triangles filled with spinach or cheese ) and the Greek yemista me lahano or stuffed cabbage leaves. // My own predilection for stuffed foods includes almost all forms of stuffed fish and shellfish . The potential for such dishes is virtually endless - stuffed clams and crabs , lobster and shrimp , whole fish and squid. // Pierre Franey and I were recently skimming through Escoffier to find the list of his lobster stuffings . There was one with an amusing name , lobster Clarence . Precisely who Clarence was we have no earthly idea , but he inspired a creation of lobster halves filled with rice , stuffed with medallions of cooked lobster and with a curry sauce spooned over. // Here is a sampler of fish and shellfish dishes , all of them filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster a la Clarence ; stuffed clams and crabs , shrimp with a pork filling and striped bass with a chopped clam mixture baked in its cavity . <> <> Homards Farcis Clarence ( Curried stuffed lobsters ) <> <> 4 cooked lobsters , 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds each ( see recipe ) <> 2 tablespoons butter <> 2 tablespoons flour <> 1 tablespoon curry powder <> 1 cup milk <> 1 1/4 cups heavy cream <> Salt to taste , if desired <> Freshly ground pepper to taste <> 1 1/3 cups cooked rice <> 1/2 cup thinly sliced truffles , optional ( see note ) . // 1 .
