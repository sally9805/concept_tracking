Doctors take a new look at mankind 's oldest , most stubborn agony <P> On a sunny day in Africa 10 million years ago , give or take a few million , Mr. and Mrs. Ramapithecus and their children were out foraging for food . Like their primate cousins in the forest , they usually swung gracefully from limb to limb searching out nuts , fruits and berries . But this day was different . A fierce rainstorm had knocked all their favorites off the branches , and the Ramas , alas , were forced to descend from the trees to find something to eat . <P> Moving awkwardly on all fours , knuckles bent , they were ungainly creatures on the ground and also extremely vulnerable . Barely 3 ft. high , unable to see over the tall grass , Rama suddenly found himself and his brood confronted by a snarling saber-toothed tiger . What to do ? <P> The forest was too far off for a dash to safety . So , in an inspired gesture , Ramapithecus reached for a rock with both forefeet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the predator . Startled to see this usually four-footed prey erect , the tiger cautiously retreated . But the ape-man 's triumph was costly . Unaccustomed to the abrupt , upright position , he was left doubled over in agony with a piercing pain in his lower back . <P> <P> A anthropological fable ? Perhaps . <P> But there is little doubt that , when man 's ancestors first learned to stand on hind legs , they exposed themselves to aches in the back that have been plaguing their descendants ever since . Today Ramapithecus ' spinal distress is experienced millions of times a day around the world . Indeed , after headaches , pain in the back-usually the lower - is man 's most common and intractable physical complaint . It is also the object of intensive investigation by doctors into new ways of curing this most ancient of ailments . <P> <P> At one point or another in their lives , eight of every ten people on earth will suffer from this universal affliction . In the U.S. alone , as many as 75 million Americans have back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Of these , 5 million are partly disabled , and 2 million are unable to work at all . <P> Backaches can strike almost everyone , the young and the old , males and females , people of all classes and professions . Thomas Jefferson suffered an acute case of backache when he rashly took it upon himself to show his slaves how to use a plow . Ernest Hemingway , who had a nagging back problem , chose to write standing up . To ease the pain of a wartime injury , John Kennedy spent hours in the soothing comfort of a White House rocking chair . <P> More recent victims of back trouble have included Cyrus Vance , Edmund Muskie , Elizabeth Taylor , Joan Sutherland and Barbra Streisand . Sports figures suffer from back pain too . Golfer Lee Trevino and former New York Yankee Infielder Tony Kubek have been strick en . Earlier this year Hockey Center Stan Mikita of the Chicago Black Hawks was permanently sidelined by his aching back . <P> No one except a victim can truly understand the complete sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is suddenly struck down by this devastating , if usually tem porary , ailment . The victim 's world quickly shrinks , often limited at the onset to bed or couch . Work and household chores are almost totally ignored , and every movement is fraught with peril .
