As oil prices have taken their steepest plunge ever , energy producers from Mexico City to Moscow have felt the pinch . While some are suffering more than others , no major petroleum exporter has entirely escaped the pain . A look at the economic and political woes that cheap oil is causing once mighty producers around the world : <P> LATIN AMERICA . Mexico is No. 1 on the list of endangered energy exporters . It earns 70% of its foreign exchange from the sale of oil , and this year 's price declines will slash revenues by about $6 billion . That could make it virtually impossible for the cash-strapped country to meet payments on the $97 billion it owes to foreign countries . Some economists now estimate that Mexico stands an 80% chance of defaulting on its mountain of debt . Several experts say that conditions are already more dire than in 1982 , when a temporary Mexican default sent ripples of panic through the international financial system . <P> Mexican government officials have been pressing U.S. banks and other lenders to relax their terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in new loans . President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado warned that bankers must share " the responsibility and sacrifice " of solving Mexico 's financial ills . So far , though , creditors have been wary of risking new money . <P> Meanwhile , tens of thousands of Mexicans have demonstrated against austerity measures that De la Madrid has imposed since 1982 in an effort to pay interest on the country 's loans . The belt tightening has slashed government spending , shoved the economy into a painful recession , and boosted unemployment to about 15% . " The political system is being pushed into a corner , " says Jonathan Heath , senior economist for Ciemex-Wharton , the Mexican division of Philadelphia-based Wharton Econometric . " A lot of people in the government want default , and though they are not the ones with the most clout now , at any given moment they could be heard . " <P> Events are moving swiftly in Venezuela too . No sooner did Caracas refinance nearly two-thirds of its $35 billion foreign debt last February than plummeting oil prices made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least $5 billion off the country 's petroleum revenues , which account for more than 90% of its foreign exchange , and could force President Jaime Lusinchi to return to bankers to seek better terms . With the country now in the third year of a recession , Lusinchi has little political room to maneuver . He has already promised that a job-creating $5 billion public-works program will not be touched . Venezuelans are counting on their nation 's $13.7 billion of foreign-exchange reserves , the largest in Latin America , to see them through the current crunch .
