- Nell Sigmon , textile worker // BEFORE World War II , the working conditions in Southern textile mills in the five-state Piedmont region were harsh and unrelenting . Exposed to heat , mechanical dangers , air pollution , and the constant banging of weaving machines , tens of thousands of men , women , and children worked long hours in low-paid obscurity between the 1880s and the 1930s . Labor laws were virtually unknown then . Pension plans were nonexistent. // In a new book , ' ' Like a Family : The Making of a Southern Cotton Mill World , ' ' published by the University of North Carolina Press , workers like Nell Sigmon tell of their experiences in the mills . To help paint an accurate picture of the culture of mills and company towns , 200 workers who worked there before World War II were interviewed as part of the research for the book. // // The authors state in the preface , ' ' . . . we committed ourselves to presenting our arguments in a storytelling style ; by allowing millhands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach an audience that makes history but seldom reads it. ' ' // The workers speak , in vivid and poignant words , about the cruel circumstances of their lives . But they also talk about the warmth of their feelings for each other . The metaphor of ' ' family ' ' was mentioned often - an idea that helped sustain them in hardship and need. // In selecting these excerpts , The Home Forum pays tribute to that spirit of family . <> <> George Shue : ' ' Back in them days the cotton mill people was about the lowest class of people there were . They called them linthead . That ' s right , that ' s what you ' d hear - linthead . Well , cotton mill people didn ' t worry about it ; they were the best people in the world . They ' re about that way all the way around . They love people . They love to do things for people . And they don ' t take nothing off of people . People come and want to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They just fight for theirself . ' ' <> <> Hoyle McCorkle : ' ' I guess there were two hundred houses on this village ( mill town ) , and I knew practically all of them from a kid up . It was kind of a cliche : You grew up here and you knew everybody . It had its bad points ; we didn ' t make too much money , I know my father didn ' t . But like I said , it was kind of one big family , and we hung together and survived . It was a two-hundred headed family . Everybody on this hill , we looked after one another . ' ' <> <> Ila Rice : ' ' On a cold , clear morning you could hear them ( textile factory ) whistles so plain . ' ' <> <> John Wesley Snipes : ' ' I never had no use for a cotton mill . Look at it run twelve hours a day , and the same old thing in the morning , and the same old thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , but I had to do it . I had to make bread and butter . ' ' <> <> Carrie Gerringer : ' ' We worked five days and a half , ten hours ( a day ) , and just made five dollars and a half a week . Mama would take all but fifty cents . We felt like it wasn ' t right , but we didn ' t say nothing : we knowed better . She had three young ' uns to raise . ' ' <> <> Eula Durham : ' ' There was twelve of us , and whenever one would outgrow anything , Mama would take that thing and cut it down and fix it so the younger ones could wear it . And when they got where they couldn ' t wear it and they hadn ' t wore it out , she ' d patch that thing and fix it up and the one down below you got it.

We lived about a mile and a quarter from the mill , and I ' d carry his lunch every day . He ' d tell me to come on in the mill , and he made me fill his batteries while he run the weavers ' looms - and I was just a little fellow . See , I knew a whole lot about the mill before I ever went in one . ' ' <> <> Curtis Enlow : ' ' I was about thirteen years old , and I decided I would go to work ( in the mill ) . Well , I went to work , and my Dad says if I quit when school started , he ' d let me work . I went back to school but I wasn ' t learning nothing - I didn ' t think I was . So I went and told him , and he says , ' All right , you ain ' t learning nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ' <> <> Nannie Pharis : ' ' We was all happy .

' ' <> <> Edna Hargett : ' ' Back then , when anybody got married , we ' d celebrate them , beat on tin cans and things like that , give them a serenade . They didn ' t go off on honeymoons back then , you know . They went on back to work right after they got married . So we ' d go down there ( to their house ) and we ' d take cans and beat them together and holler . They ' d raise the window and come out and speak to us , and then we ' d come home . We had a good time celebrating them . ' ' <> <> Mary Thompson : ' ' . . . Now anyone that come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in patterns ) and didn ' t have nobody to teach them , had to pay somebody to teach them . They wouldn ' t hire you unless you could hire someone to teach you , because it was expensive to teach anyone . It ' d take more skill . And the bosses couldn ' t teach you that , because they didn ' t know it theirself . He could see how it was supposed to be done and all like that , but he couldn ' t have sat down and done it hisself . . . . I loved drawing-in . I enjoyed it more than anything I ' ve done . . . . I ' d rather draw-in than eat when I was hungry . ' ' <> <> Eva Hopkins : ' ' They didn ' t have air-conditioning in the mills and it was terribly hot .

It got to where ( the machine ) wouldn ' t do its work , it would be so full of particles and dust . When I was coming along , and for a long time , that was all in the air . ' ' <> <> Lela Ranier : ' ' He ( the mill owner ) would come in . . . and go thro ' the mill lookin ' . I wouldn ' t think he would know most of the people that worked in the mill ' cause he wasn ' t there long enough to learn ' em .

They could really browbeat the people , no doubt about that . They had them over a barrel . They would threaten you with ( taking away ) your house . They pretty well had the upper hand over you all the time. ' ' // Eva Hopkins : ' ' My husband and I got married , and we started having babies , and you just have to go on from there . You ' re just more or less trapped in the job you ' re in , because when you have children you just can ' t quit and go looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married I would daydream about who I was going to marry . I was going to marry somebody that was rich so that I wouldn ' t have to work ; I could have a nice home and beautiful clothes . Then after I married , I still had daydreams . I dreamed of wanting a better life for them . It ' s been a good life , but I ' d like for them not to have to work in the mills , to live in better sections of town , to have nicer homes , more conveniences , nicer cars , nicer everything than we had . Dreams like that . ' ' <> <> Edna Hargett : ' ' I ' d get up at five o ' clock in the mornings , because you had to be at work at six . . . .

' ' // Don Faucette : ' ' You take during the Depression years , everybody had a few beans . Well , they had a great big old pot , five or six neighbors had a big old pot out there . Put all the beans in one pot and made a big pot which would go around to all the families instead of just feeding one . ' ' <> <> Icy Norman : ' ' . . . You know , money can ' t buy happiness . Money can ' t buy joy . That ' s why I said I enjoyed working on my job . . . . When I come out of that mill , I knew I had done the very best I could .
