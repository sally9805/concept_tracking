" I am more confident each day that we can produce a bill that will come very close to the President ' s mark , " said Representative Dan Rostenkowski , Democrat of Illinois and the committee chairman , at his first news conference in a month. // Representative John J. Duncan of Tennessee , the panel ' s ranking Republican , shared the chairman ' s confidence , although Mr. Duncan said he was not sure he personally would support the legislation . " I definitely think we can have a bill out of here this year , " Mr. Duncan said. // // Week of Debate Planned // The House Democratic leadership has set aside the first week in December for tax debate by the full House of Representatives . Mr. Rostenkowski said he expected to meet that deadline. // The Senate will not act on taxes this year , but Senate leaders have promised to consider the issue in 1986 if the House sends them a bill this year. // Republican lawmakers said the Administration would like to see House passage of a tax measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the President ' s plan could be corrected next year in the Senate. // President Reagan has made tax revision the top legislative priority of his second term . In recent months , he has made several speeches around the country promoting his tax plan , but the public ' s response to it seemed generally lukewarm . <> <> Treasury Official Silent // Ronald A. Pearlman , Deputy Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy , today observed what he called the Administration ' s " gag rule " against commenting on the committee ' s work . Mr. Pearlman attended all of its meetings this weekend. // The sense of progress resulted not so much from the actual votes the committee took over the weekend as from a perception by committee members that political deals had been cut on the toughest issues . These include the deductibility of state and local taxes , the taxation of fringe benefits and the rules for business depreciation. // Today the Ways and Means Committee took these steps : // * It rejected President Reagan ' s proposal that companies be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of dividends they pay to shareholders . However , the panel decided to put the 10 percent deduction in effect gradually , at the rate of one percentage point a year , so that it would not be fully effective until 1997. // * It agreed to repeal , beginning next year , the ability of individuals to exclude from their income for tax purposes $100 worth ( on joint returns , $200 worth ) of dividend payments. // * It voted to restrict the ability of parents to shelter their income from taxation by giving it to their small children or by placing it in trusts , including so-called Clifford Trusts , for their children. // * It decided to make it less attractive for companies to set up Employee Stock Ownership Plans to give their employees a long-term financial interest in the companies. // * It agreed to limit the ability of companies to buy other companies to take advantage of their tax losses . <> <> Weeks Without Progress // Mr. Rostenkowski called the weekend meetings after several weeks without progress had led to reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several lawmakers and members of Mr. Rostenkowski ' s staff said the weekend ' s developments could be decisive to the prospects for tax revision. // Today the tone was much different from what it had been before . " It ' s unbelievable what ' s been happening , " said Representative Robert T. Matsui , a California Democrat , as today ' s session began . " A week ago people were saying tax reform was dead . Now it ' s completely shifted. " // Mr. Rostenkowski appears to have obtained the votes of committee members on issues that are tangential to them by promising his backing on matters critical to their own constituents. // At his news conference , the chairman declined to respond directly to questions about reports that he had made a commitment to back retention of deductions for state and local tax payments in return for several members ' support on other matters. // He did say that he understood " the great concern , not only in the committee but on the floor of the House , " over the President ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Yorkers // Such concern is greatest among Representatives from New York . Their constituents pay the highest state and local income , property and sales taxes in the country . The three New Yorkers on the Ways and Means Committee - Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan and Thomas J. Downey of Suffolk County , both Democrats , and Raymond J. McGrath of Nassau County , a Republican - apparently sided with the chairman on every vote this weekend , although the votes taken in today ' s session will not be made public until Monday. // An important Administration official , who asked not to be quoted by name , said , " What we ' re most concerned about is the idea of a deal on state and local taxes. " // If those deductions are maintained in the committee ' s bill , tax rates will almost certainly have to be higher than the levels of 15 percent to 35 percent that Mr. Reagan proposed . The President has been portrayed as feeling more strongly about reducing tax rates than about any other element of his plan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of private development bonds , timber investments and trust provisions - were resolved through compromises . <> <> Narrowing of Tax Breaks // The tax breaks were not eliminated as President Reagan proposed , but they were restricted to a greater or lesser degreee. // That concerned both the legislators who favor abolition of as many tax preferences as possible and those who believe the foundation of the tax system should be social and economic incentives. // Representative Byron L. Dorgan , Democrat of North Dakota , who fits in the former category , complained that the panel was " creating some new tax loopholes. " // " It ' s like fixing fences when I was a kid , " Mr. Dorgan said . " You fix one side , and the cows get out on the other. " // On the other hand , Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota , an influential Republican who has been skeptical about the wisdom of tax revision , said he thought the committee was " moving much too fast to produce anything any good . " He cautioned , " We ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Frenzel said , however , that approval of a bill now seems inevitable . " We ' ve accelerated our pace a quantum leap , " Mr. Frenzel said. //
