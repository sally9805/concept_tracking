Sequestration is the last resort of national politicians unwilling to cut government spending in much the same way that patriotism is called the last refuge of scoundrels . The obscure word , which looks like a refugee from a crossword puzzle , means seizure , and that is what happened last week . President Bush directed all federal agencies to meet the budget-deficit- reduction targets specified by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law by imposing $16.1 billion in across-the-board spending cuts . Worthy domestic-spending programs such as subsidized housing were cut the same 5.3% as pork-barrel projects like the Agricultural Extension Service . Under sequestration , the Defense Department faces a 4.3% chop , with important items like military readiness facing the same reduction as questionable projects like the Stealth bomber . <P> For fiscal 1990 , the law required Congress to produce a budget with a deficit of less than $110 billion . Despite the Administration 's optimistic forecasts of continued strong economic growth and lower interest rates plus some fiscal legerdemain , congressional efforts fell $6.1 billion short . <P> The battle for fiscal discipline quickly degenerated into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only between parties and branches of Government but also onto the Gramm-Rudman procedure itself . <P> Trouble started in the spring , when congressional leaders and the Bush Administration began putting together a deal . The President 's goal was to keep his read-my-lips campaign promise of " no new taxes . " Congressional leaders wanted to appear to meet deficit-reduction targets without cutting any politically popular spending programs . Budget director Richard Darman came up with a solution that was simple  --  too simple . A cut in the capital-gains tax would at least temporarily raise money to cover the revenue shortfall . Many Democrats at first supported the plan that looked like all gain , no pain . <P> Around Labor Day , however , the consensus that Darman had put together began to fall apart . " Everything was going along swimmingly , " explains an Administration official , " until the drug plan came out of nowhere , and then capital gains became partisan instead of the easy way out . " The battle against drugs meant new spending , and Democrats began attacking a capital- gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous . <P> House Speaker Thomas Foley privately proposed dropping the hundreds of extraneous spending programs  --  and the capital-gains cut  --  from the budget- busting bill . But Darman turned down the offer , thinking he could get the kind of trimmed-down budget he preferred as well as the capital-gains cut . When it became clear the Administration would be charged with favoring capital gains over budget cutting , Darman relented . But by then it was too late to stop sequestration from taking effect . <P> In fact , when it comes to economic policy , the Administration appears to care little about deficit reduction . The White House seems to care only about keeping Bush 's no-new-taxes pledge . Administration officials like to point to Darman 's optimistic economic assumptions and deficit predictions as well as the relatively good business climate . Bush has not uttered a word about the budget deficit in weeks .
