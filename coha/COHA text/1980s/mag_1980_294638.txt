The Central Bureau of Statistics in Jerusalem announced last week what for Israelis is the most vital news of the month : the inflation rate . In June it slowed to 4.6% , or an annual cost of living increase of 76% , vs. last month 's 133% . <P> As soon as the inflation figure was announced , Israelis pulled out pocket calculators and began computing the value of their bank accounts , and merchants began adjusting prices . Banks , retirement funds and other financial institutions are automatically required to adjust the value of savings accounts , pensions and life insurance policies to offset fully the losses caused by the cost of living increases . A person 's bank balance , for example , is immediately raised in line with the previous month 's inflation . Every three months , employers must add 80% of the last quarter 's inflation to their workers ' wages . Informally , rents and the price of a wide range of big-tag goods like autos , television sets and video recorders soon increase as well . All this is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> On the positive side , cost of living adjustments have enabled Israelis to withstand the onslaught of triple-digit inflation without succumbing to the moral decay , disillusion with democratic institutions and political polarization that are normally associated with a prolonged period of soaring prices . Israelis have continued to save at their commendably high rate ( 24% of net personal income last year , vs. less than 5% in the U.S. ) . Because of the continual upward adjustments , the retired and disabled on pensions have not been reduced to poverty . And , despite the business turmoil caused by galloping costs , the country 's economy grew last year by a strong 5% . <P> On the negative side , however , indexation has proved to be an engine of more price rises . Israeli inflation has created a disoriented economy in which consumers become so buffeted by price increases that they no longer even remember what an item is really worth . The price of milk , for example , has climbed nearly 30% in just over a month to .27 ( 53 ) per liter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large number of businesses are hurting so badly that they are cutting back on staff or closing down . A major cause : the annual interest rate on bank loans is 150% . <P> Indexation at home has led to a constant devaluation on the world money markets of Israeli currency , whose name was changed from the pound to the biblical shekel earlier this year . One digit was knocked off the currency so that 10 became one shekel . During the past six months the shekel has fallen from 3.4 to 4.7 to the dollar . Because of its huge domestic and foreign borrowings , the country already must spend a crippling 30% of its G.N.P . on repayment of loans and interest . As its currency loses value , the burden of its foreign debts will become heavier . But despite all this , Israel has no plans to ease the country off cost of living adjustments . In fact , the government is expected to pass new legislation this week that would index income taxes to inflation .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
