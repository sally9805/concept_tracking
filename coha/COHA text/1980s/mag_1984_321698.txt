Be it potential terrorists or traffic jams , Los Angeles is prepared <P> It was a record day for disaster , even by the standards of megalopolitan Los Angeles . Early in the morning , Pasadena police cornered two terrorists in a catering office at the Rose Bowl , site of the Olympic soccer matches . A traffic snarl brought two major freeways to a steamy standstill , and a landslide smothered a chunk of the Pacific Coast Highway . During the Olympic cycling event , a section of bleachers at the Dominguez Hills velodrome collapsed , injuring 50 people . By day 's end Angelenos had survived a bomb scare and a raging brushfire . <P> Well , sort of . Actually , the multiple calamities-340 in all-were fictional , dreamed up for Torchlight III , the third in a series of dry runs of the Olympic-security coordinating system . But for the law-enforcement authorities who went through the exercise last month , the hypothetical mayhem was serious business . Its aim : to give security agencies , ranging from the FBI to the Fullerton , Calif. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the July 28 opening of the 23rd Olympic Games . <P> The Olympic version of mission control is a draped cubicle deep in Piper Technical Center , a city-owned warehouse and heliport in downtown Los Angeles . Once the Games begin , representatives of all the law-enforcement agencies involved will staff the Pentagon-designed nerve center round the clock . Five large screens will project an array of security information , like the size of a traffic jam or the location of a hostage incident . Says Commander William Rathburn of the Los Angeles police department ( L.A.P.D. ) , who will oversee the operation : " A civilian security coordination effort of this magnitude has never before been undertaken in the U.S. " <P> With good reason . The 40 training sites , 29 event sites and three Olympic Villages sprawl over more than 4,500 sq . mi. and are linked by about 150 miles of automobile-choked highways . Protecting the anticipated 600,000 athletes , coaches , dignitaries and tourists at each location , and in transit between them , will be a logistical nightmare . Moreover , unlike other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. does not have a national police force . At least 50 local , state and federal and nine private security organizations are responsible for guarding the Games . This potential jurisdictional tangle was sorted out on paper months ago ; the agreements have been tested and refined by the Torchlight exercises . " The bickering has not happened , because all of these people believe we are on a noble mission , " says Olympic Security Director Edgar Best , a retired FBI agent . <P> The bodyguard count alone is positively Olympian . At full strength , there will be 16,000 armed officers on patrol during the Games . Aiding them will be about 8,000 unarmed private security guards . Dressed in blue-and-tan uniforms , the private guards will monitor the Olympic Villages , event sites and hotel lobbies . They will also be on duty at the warehouses and shipping docks of the food caterers for the athletes , making sure that no tampering occurs and that delivery trucks are properly sealed .                @ @ @ @ @
