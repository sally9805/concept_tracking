None of Reagan 's four children is dedicated to politics <P> No law ever decreed that a presidential candidate must be accompanied on the campaign trail by a smiling wife and a bevy of pink-cheeked children . But a long tradition claims that the voters want a close look at every prospective First Family , and that they want any such family to be very familial indeed . No divorced man has ever been elected President , and except for Warren Harding , there has not been a childless President since James Buchanan ( 1857-61 ) , who was also the only President to remain a lifelong bachelor . <P> Ronald Reagan lists family along with neighborhood , work , peace and freedom as the core of Americans ' " shared values , " so it seems somewhat odd that his own children were so rarely seen during the primary campaign . It also seems somewhat odd that Reagan barely mentioned his children in his official biography . " We would be , " jokes Reagan 's oldest son , Mike , 35 , " the unknown First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger Reagans , and occasionally embarrassments . Oldest Daughter Maureen , 39 , sometimes gets headlines for her ardent support of the Equal Rights Amendment , which Reagan just as ardently opposes . Second Daughter Patti , 27 , attracted attention by going around with Bernie Leadon , former banjo player with the Eagles . And when Younger Son Ronald , 22 , became a dancer with Manhattan 's Jeffrey II Company , the training troupe for the Jeffrey Ballet , gossip columnists began raising eyebrows and talking of family hostilities . " How embarrassed is Ronald Reagan really about his ballet-dancing son ? " leered the New York Post . " Answer : plenty . " <P> <P> TIME Senior Correspondent Laurence I. Barrett interviewed all four of the younger Reagans and found them engagingly different from what the gossip suggested . His report : <P> <P> The Reagan children are hardly recluses , but neither are they as funky as sometimes portrayed . They have lives of their own . None is dedicated to politics . <P> Reagan 's public reticence about them comes partly from his strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides , from Nancy Reagan 's extreme sensitivity to Reagan 's marriage to Jane Wyman . Nancy , the mother of the two younger children , would like to pretend that the first marriage never happened . Reagan caters to this sensitivity , and that is why there was so little mention of the marriage and the children in his autobiography . In fact , some friends think that the extreme closeness of Reagan and Nancy has created a barrier for all the children . <P> Maureen , now a tall , sturdy , handsome woman , ebullient but more than a touch wary , was seven when her parents were divorced . She lived with her mother , but remembers going riding on her fa ther 's ranch and hearing him recite The Shooting of Dan McGrew . She jocularly refers to him as " Dear Old Dad . " Like all the other Reagan children , she spent much of her youth in private boarding schools ; like all of them , she dropped out of college ( Marymount College of Virginia ) . She went to work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 , while Dear Old Dad was an active Democrat for Nixon . " Once in a while , " she says , " I remind him that I have time on him as a Republican .
