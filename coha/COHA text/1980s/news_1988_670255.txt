WASHINGTON  --  The drought that has withered crops in many states is tragic for farmers , but is unlikely to cause acute problems for the nation ' s economy . Big problems in the Farm Belt no longer have much impact on the rest of the economy . The nation has changed significantly since the " Dirty Thirties , " when dust storms blew out of the Dust Bowl and darkened eastern skies . In those days , a quarter of the American population lived on the farm . Today , it ' s 2. 2% . Moreover , after years of agricultural overproduction , the drought is harshly accomplishing what the Reagan administration has long sought to do  --  reduce farm surpluses . Soaring farm prices will boost the nation ' s inflation rate somewhat , and interest rates may rise slightly as well . But even these changes probably will remain minimal because crop prices play such a minor role in today ' s cost of living . The bottom line on the drought ' s impact : " I don ' t think it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington , Mass . The effects will filter through the U.S. economy in complex  --  and , undoubtedly , surprising  --  ways , but the repercussions won ' t be as pervasive as , say , the sharp swings in oil prices that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s . " In a modern industrial economy , energy tends to flow through with more impact than agriculture , " says Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell , who is himself a farmer . " You can overstate the effects " of the drought . Indeed , the drought is creating " lots of winners as well as losers , " according to Mark Drabenstott , an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City . Many farming areas that have had ample rainfall or irrigation are faring nicely from the run-up in commodity prices . The drought could even help reduce the nation ' s troublesome twin deficits : budget and trade . On the budget front , higher farm prices are likely to mean the government will save more money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance . And on trade , economists say the reduced volume of farm exports will be largely offset by increased export prices . All such projections , of course , depend on how long the drought lasts . If it continues throughout the growing season and is followed by another dry spell next year , the picture could change significantly . But for now , analysts project that the drought ' s impact on U.S. economic growth and inflation will be quite mild . Crop production accounts for only 1% of the total U.S. output , so a drought that reduces crop yields by 20% would cut total output , or gross national product , by only 0. 2% . Since much of that dip in production can be offset by selling off surplus grain stocks , the economic effect may be even smaller than the numbers suggest . There also will be some spillover effects . Iowa State University economist Neil Harl says sales of pick-up trucks , farm implements , furniture and shoes will be hurt . Higher food prices could reduce consumer spending on other items , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WEFA Group , an economic forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd , Pa. , estimates the effects will peak in the fourth quarter , when the drought could slice a half percentage point off growth , but will disappear almost entirely by the end of next year . " It ' s certainly not the kind of a supply shock that would kick us into a recession , " says WEFA economist John Hagens . A Reagan administration assessment concludes that the drought " is not expected to have a major effect on the overall growth rate of the economy . " The impact on inflation may also be muted , analysts say . The cut in crop production will raise consumer food prices , but in indirect ways . In an age of frozen gourmet foods , the processing , packaging and marketing of food have more to do with retail prices than the cost of farm commodities . Richard Gady , a vice president at ConAgra Inc. , says grains account for only 10% of the cost of cereals . " Even if commodity prices double , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% impact on the price of food . " The WEFA estimate suggests the overall effect will be to raise consumer prices by about a half percentage point next year . For a historical perspective , economist Gary Benjamin of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank looked at changes in the overall inflation rate following three major droughts . Surprisingly , he found inflation in the year after each drought was lower than in the year before . " It tends to suggest to me that we might not get as much of a surge in food prices as many people believe , " he said . Rising prices caused by the drought should only boost interest rates if the markets and the Federal Reserve decide they reflect a permanent increase in inflation , and not a temporary price surge . For now , Fed officials seem to believe that the drought isn ' t a reason to tighten their grip on credit and push rates higher . " I ' m not as convinced as some that there is much relation between inflation and the drought , " says Mr. Angell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have policy implications , " agrees Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins . But Mr. Hoskins and others acknowledge that if higher food prices lead workers to successfully push for higher wages , the Fed may act to head off an inflationary spiral .
