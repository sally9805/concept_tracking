Laurie Anderson : United States Live ( Warner Bros. , five disks ) . Laurie Anderson 's United States , Parts I-IV , which premiered two years ago at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , is the work that first brought the avant-garde form of performance art to a wide audience . A dazzling synthesis of music , narration and film , Anderson 's free-associating view of American materialism was marked by both wry humor ( I dreamed I had to take a test in a Dairy Queen on another planet , goes one section ) and an imaginative use of technology : with a device called a Vocoder , she can speak and sing in chords . Anderson 's unsettling imagery and aggressively minimalist music hardly make for relaxing listening , but United States is a landmark in the art of the ' 80s , a guided tour through a post-punk apocalypse led by an innocent at home whose sense of the ironic is the only sure road map . <P> Kodaly : Sonata for Solo Cello , Op. 8 ; Duo for Violin and Cello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violin ; Nonesuch ) . Except for the Hary Janos Suite and perhaps the choral Psalmus Hungaricus , Zoltan Kodaly 's music is not much heard today , only 16 years after his death . It is his contemporary , friend and colleague , Bela Bartok , who seems to have won the Hungarian seat in the 20th century pantheon of great composers . But Kodaly 's music , while less frankly adventurous than Bartok 's , is just as redolent of the Magyar spirit , and these two works display it well . The fiery Duo ( 1914 ) , full of rich and varied strong sonorities , gets a passionate reading from Phillips , who has a flourishing chamber-music career , and Grossman , a Chicago Symphony cellist . Even better is the brooding Sonata ( 1915 ) , which employs just about every string-writing trick there is , including left-hand pizzicato and scordatura ( nonstandard tuning ) . As close to technical impossibility as a piece can be and still remain playable , the Sonata is a 20th century masterpiece that deserves to be known by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while not as pyrotechnical as , say , Janos Starker 's , captures all the work 's quintessentially Hungarian soulfulness . <P> Schubert : Piano Quintet in A Major , " Trout " ( Emanuel Ax , piano , with members of the Guarneri Quartet and Julius Levine , double bass ) ; Mozart : Eine kleine Nachtmusik ( Guarneri Quartet with Julius Levine ; RCA ) . Schubert 's ineffable " Trout " Quintet , so named for its use of the composer 's song The Trout as the basis of the fourth movement , is one of the glories of the chamber-music repertory , beloved of pianists and string players ( and audiences ) everywhere for its grace , wit and warmth . Ax 's sensitive , full- toned pianism and the Guarneri 's rich ensemble are perfectly matched here , to each other and to the piece . Some readings of the " Trout " emphasize its sparkle and brio , but this one favors a relaxed elegance : it is less a day at the beach than a month in the country . A bonus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Mozart chestnut , played by the Guarneri and Levine instead of the more familiar small string orchestra . The five musicians give a sophisticated , gracious performance .
