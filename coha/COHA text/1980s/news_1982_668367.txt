In the eight years since America lifted its prohibition on gold trading , there rose to prominence a group of financial advisers who came to be known among themselves as " the hard currency industry " - and as " goldbugs " to everybody else . Fellows like James Dines and Harry Browne , James Sinclair and Nicholas Deak , Howard Ruff and Douglas R. Casey preached a gospel of apocalypse for paper money . Ruff , author of " How To Prosper During the Coming Bad Years , " and Casey , author of " Crisis Investing , Opportunities and Profits in The Coming Great Depression . " were archetypical goldbugs . They issued warnings that were more pointed ; they had visions of the future that were more salacious ; they offered advice that was more flamboyant . According to Ruff and Casey , only hard money , meaning gold and silver bullion and coins , would prove to be the only safe bet in the coming upheaval . Those foolish enough to trust in old-fashioned investments , such as government bonds and blue-chip stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bags of coins and precious stones , they said , and citizens should either fill their houses with a year ' s supply of food , or be ready to leave the country . Both Ruff and Casey rode to the top of the best-seller lists with this recipe . Thousands of persons bought subscriptions to their newsletters , at $100 a year and up . As it has turned out , the goldbugs ' advice was the equivalent of recommending stock pools to small investors in September 1929 . The crash in gold came in 1980 , just as its price peaked at around $850 an ounce . The fall was brutal . Today , gold is selling for around $340 an ounce , thanks to a brisk rally last week that prevented it from falling to the $250 floor that nearly universally had been predicted for it as recently as two weeks ago . Meanwhile , Silver is at $6 an ounce ; diamond sellers often simply can ' t find a buyer ; the hard currency industry is in disarray . Amid all this , Ruff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly embarrassed by the roller-coaster ride of the last three years . Casey is now running " leadership schools " for gullible celebrities . Ruff is scrambling to keep his empire afloat . Casey caught it sharply from Forbes magazine . In a recent feature called " Turning $100,000 into $58,263 , " it set up a mock portfolio , patterned as closely as possible on the advice he was giving . Noting that Casey had recommended so many different tactics during the last few years , many of them conflicting , that it was impossible to be certain exactly what he thought at any given time , the magazine nevertheless priced what it thought a reasonable person might have bought on Casey ' s say-so . A $100,000 portfolio was invested 20 percent in gold , 10 percent in silver , 10 percent in a gold-mining stock , 25 percent in some small energy stocks Casey had recommended , and 25 percent in Swiss francs . If the money had been invested in September 1980 , when Casey ' s book hit the best-seller charts , it would be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s advice haven ' t had to wait for the coming great depression . ' They ' ve been able to manufacture their own , " the magazine concluded . Ruff got his comeuppance from Fortune Magazine . After a thorough investigation , one of that magazine ' s most talented reporters concluded that , although Ruff gave " the outward appearance of escaping the carnage , " in fact he had barely survived the Goldbug Crash . A.E . Ehrbar , a member of Fortune ' s Board Of Editors , said that a drop in the circulation of Ruff ' s newsletter , a rash of new ventures and some inept management had combined to put Ruff in " a severe cash bind . " Ruff denied he was short of cash , but acknowledged that he ' d been putting the arm on rich subscribers in an attempt to raise $1 million . Ruff ' s record as a forecaster was about average , Ehrbar wrote : he ' d been right about half the time . His worst error came in September 1979 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling at about $375 an ounce . A month later , he told them to buy them back - at $475 an ounce . Since then he ' s done better . It was Ruff ' s record as a promoter that was remarkable , according to Ehrbar . Building on the base of his subscription mailing list , Ruff sold special coins , board games , fancy cruises to exotic places designed as " investment seminars " and staged conventions two times a year . He makes records ( " Money , Money , Money " and " The Impossible Dream " ) and television shows and even published a Christmas catalogue . Ruff ' s record as a businessman ? Ah , that was somehat disappointing , according to Ehrbar . Ruff had told him that his publishing company , Target Inc. , had earned $1 million in 1980 on revenues of about $23 million . By industry standards , Ehrbar wrote , Target should have earned from $5 million to $8 million . What happened ? Part of the reason was hustle : Ruff did a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly ( $1.2 million ) " hotline " to which they could telephone requests for financial help . But expensive bets on gold and silver futures that turned out wrong may have been a major expense , the Fortune writer said , and just plain sloppy management may have been another reason . After one management shuffle , the new boss announced he ' s saved $25,000 company dollars on auto insurance premiums alone . It all added up to cash straits , Ehrbar wrote . Ruff said he was simply looking for a little extra working capital , but Ehrbar thought it was a close thing . For Ruff , it would have been nothing new . He has diversified out offinancial disaster several times . A stockbroker during the 1960s , he went broke running a speed-reading franchise , then turned to selling dehydrated food to families worried about the end of civilization . An utterly charming person , who as a young man sang on-call for a couple of dozen San Francisco funeral homes ( he eventually performed on the Ed Sullivan Show , and still sounds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing a TV show modeled on Phil Donahue ' s morning show . It , too , seems to have failed , but meanwhile Ruff has inaugurated a new series of newsletters - among them one by Doug Casey - and a series of financial investment seminars . In a recent visit to Boston , Ruff was jolly as could be : " This is what I love doing , " he said . " The difference between me and the rest of the industry is that I ' ve got a sense of humor . " Likewise , Doug Casey , a carefree fellow who has taken plenty of money out of his books , isn ' t hurting . ( He denies having sold the best-selling " Crisis Investing " to publisher and author Robert Ringer - " Winning Through Intimidation , " " Looking Out for Number One " - for a flat $30,000 . ) He gives seminars , writes newsletters and otherwise poses as an international adventurer . But for investors ? Pity those who followed these fellows ' advice too closely . Not that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But unlike the durable metal , the reputations of its fans , the goldbugs , are more than a little tarnished .
