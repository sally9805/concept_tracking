The break sent water cascading over the streets and through the subway system before the city shut off the supply to the 48-inch main pipe and began re-routing water through other pipes. // Water flooded the stations and tunnels of the nearby subway lines and caused a substantial disruption of service . The BMT ' s N and RR trains were not running again until 10 : 30 yesterday morning . Water service was knocked out in scattered locations between Second and 10th Avenues from the 20 ' s to the 50 ' s. // // Affected Area Smaller // By yesterday morning , according to John Cunningham , spokesman for the city ' s Department of Environmental Protection , the affected area had shrunk to the blocks between Third and Ninth Avenues and 36th and 42d Streets . In some places , water was cut off to entire apartment buildings , along with rows of stores and restaurants. // Tenants of some buildings rushed to grocery stores for bottled water , and a restaurateur in one affected building , at 244 Madison Avenue , carried buckets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings in the vicinity were flooded . A maintenance supervisor at 1411 Broadway , at 40th Street , said that water had leaked into the vault of the Chemical Bank branch there and that private guards had been called to protect it. // At 1431 Broadway , nearly six feet of water filled the bottom of the elevator shafts , knocking out service . Excavation work yesterday at the corner of 40th Street and Broadway , where the break occurred , revealed that a 12-foot section of cast-iron pipe had cracked lengthwise . The crack was confined to one section between joints. // " We are hoping we can get it all done Sunday , " said Mr. Cunningham of the repair effort . He said that crews were to remove the damaged section of the 65-year-old pipe last night and replace it today. // The excavation closed Broadway to traffic between 42d and 39th Streets and closed 40th Street from Seventh Avenue to the Avenue of the Americas. // Service on the IRT and IND lines was restored , then lost and restored again during the early morning , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The No. 1 , 2 and 3 trains were all halted at one time or other , as were the A , AA , B and E trains. // At the peak of disruption Friday night and early yesterday morning , IRT service was cut off from South Ferry to 96th Street , IND trains were not running between West Fourth and 59th Streets , and the BMT was not operating between Canal Street and the Lexington Avenue station at 59th Street . <> <> Two Feet Into the Air // The break just before 9 P.M. Friday shot water up through the pavement two feet into the air for three and a half hours . The water swirled along the streets - freezing and turning the walkways into treacherous paths - and sometimes reached people ' s knees as it coursed through the streets and into subway stations. // It was not the first time a 48-inch main had broken in Manhattan , Mr. Cunningham said . Last summer a pipe of that size burst at First Avenue and 52d Street. // " But there weren ' t anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had here , " he said . The lack of water pressure burdened many midtown businesses , especially restaurants with their late-Friday customers . Among the greatest inconveniences was that toilets could not be flushed . <> <> Most Service Restored // Mr. Cunningham said that the water supply to the four-foot main had been shut off at 12 : 25 A.M. yesterday and that , by rerouting water through parallel pipes , the city had managed to restore most of the service within an hour of the closing. // He said that engineers testing water pressure yesterday afternoon found it to be back to normal north and east of the break and just slightly below normal to the west. // Mr. Cunningham said the cause of the break had not yet been determined . The pipe in question was installed in 1917 , he said . " It is not by any means the oldest in the system , " he said . " We have mains under the streets that are 125 years old. " // " We are beginning to think that age is not primarily a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some 2 , 500 breaks in Manhattan between 1955 and 1978 . <> <> Prime Enemies // Instead , he said , the vibrations set off by heavy traffic , by construction and by the rumbling subway trains , combined with shifting soil that may leave whole sections of pipe without foundation , are the prime enemies of the city ' s 6 , 200-mile subterranean water network. // Exacerbating the problem is the fact that many of the mains , including the one that broke Friday , are made of cast iron and are therefore quite brittle. // Peering over the sidewalk cavity at 40th and Broadway , and getting a rare glimpse into the city ' s underground arteries , one could see a clean fissure , almost a foot across , running as far along the pipe as it was exposed and looking almost like a rusted , broken piece of pottery. // The city uses ductile steel , a metal that bends somewhat in response to shifting stresses , when it replaces the older piping . As a matter of course , some 200 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about $10 million . <> <> A Store of Pipes // For emergencies such as this , the city turns to its store of pipes . Mr. Cunningham said that a 48-inch pipe had been located in a city yard in Queens . He said that the cost of the weekend work would be between $20 , 000 and $30 , 000. // The main that broke Friday night is part of one of the city ' s three water systems , the one that brings water from the Catskill region through the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla , N.Y. // From Valhalla , the water travels down an aqueduct into the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers . Neither reservoir actually collects water , but both serve a distribution function. // From Hillview , the water comes through a 15-foot-wide tunnel under the Bronx and into Manhattan . From several shafts connected to the tunnel , water is distributed into 72-inch trunk pipes that carry it and distribute it farther . <> <> Under the Library // One of these trunks runs down Fifth Avenue and meets the 40th Street main under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water flows from Fifth to Ninth Avenue , where it joins a smaller , 30-inch main that branches northward. // Along this main are the 20- , 12- and 6-inch distribution pipes that carry the water directly into homes and office buildings . Electric pumps at the bases of the buildings send the water into rooftop collection tanks. // The Catskill waters start at so high an elevation , relative to the city , that they are carried completely by gravity until they reach the buildings themselves . Gravity again conducts the water from the tanks down into houses and offices , so that only once in the trip do pumps have to be used to bring the water to its users. // A possible explanation for the water problems on the East Side , which is not directly served by the main that ruptured , lies in the fact that the gravity-forced Catskill water drives turbines that help pump water coming in from the Croton system. // Croton water , which fills the main branching eastward from the station under the library , needs to be pumped en route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main hampered the turbines , the Croton supply may have faltered somewhat. //
