Without the pervasive odors of sidewalk cooking and the crowded street life common to many of its neighbors , it does not feel like many Latin cities. // With its immaculately dressed , meticulously groomed mostly European-stock population bustling to work and snapping up goods in the bountiful stores , it does not act like many Latin cities. // // Country ' Needs Dictatorship ' // And so it is a bit jarring when an outsider realizes that this country is being run by a very Latin-style dictatorship , and more so when people seem to take it all with a shrug. // " This country needs a dictatorship , " an Argentine explained . " The politicians are not ready . " He went on to explain that he was an air-conditioning specialist , and was desperately trying to get a visa so that he could join his brother in Palm Beach , Fla. // " I ' ve had enough , " he said . " Every day what you earned the day before is worth less . " Such contradictions are not analyzed here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten the link between their Government and their lives. // The words military dictatorship usually evoke pictures of omnipresent repression , and terror , and freedom lost . But the fact is that the dictatorship here inserts itself only marginally into the day-to-day lives of its citizens. // Businessmen and workers criticize the Government for its economic policies without fear ; the disenfranchised politicians condemn it for almost everything. // People with money can shop at high-quality stores , eat at fine restaurants and dance the night away at glitzy discotheques like New York City , a huge place with a two-story-high mural of the Manhattan skyline by someone who has apparently never been there . The free spending of money is a national way of life , spurred on by an inflation rate in excess of 100 percent . <> <> Little Street Crime // Unemployment is relatively low , although underemployment remains a serious problem . Those who remain without jobs , an Argentine woman said , do so because " they are Argentines - the job must be within six blocks from my home ; the salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Street crime is virtually nonexistent , and illegal drugs are scarce . The Government does not have to act strongly , an Argentine explained ; the people here remember what happened the last time things got out of hand , in the mid-1970 ' s . People began disappearing by the dozens . Hundreds were jailed , and more than 6 , 000 have yet to be accounted for. // And so it is perhaps not surprising that the Government allows the mothers of the missing to march in their sad little circle outside the presidential palace each Thursday . It is not just the memory of their lost ones they are keeping alive. // The Government usually relies successfully on the self-censorship borne by a lack of press safeguards to avoid criticism in the press . When it began its war it went further , establishing guidelines and using them to lie - sometimes boldly and sometimes subtly - in the press and television broadcasts . Thus its reports on the war with Britain on the Falklands islands were a shining example of optimism in the face of rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in the game , criticized reporters for purveying " the British point of view. " // When it was suggested to a top military spokesman that the foreign press might give fairer treatment if they were allowed closer than 1 , 200 miles from the battle zone , he rejected the idea . " Look at the problems the British are having with their reporters down there , " he said . " They are printing things the Government considers antipatriotic . No , our way is better. " // When the people realized they had lost the war - something they had to infer , in part because the Government had called in the nation ' s editors to ask them to avoid the word " surrender " - thousands took to the streets in a mass display of anger. // But the Government here learns slowly . As policemen rolled through downtown Buenos Aires with sirens blaring , shooting tear-gas guns and rounding up demonstrators by the dozens , reporters in the presidential palace were given the official report. // " Reduced numbers " of demonstrators had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is calm now , " the television stations were reporting as fires burned at a half-dozen intersections and demonstrators continued to chant as they fled . " Things have returned to normal. " // Throughout the war , the Government maintained an intense interest in what was being printed about it abroad - so much so that they seemed to be reading reporters ' dispatches before their editors did . While the phone system here is generally abysmal , many suspected the buzzing and clicking was not simply a mechanical problem. // When one American publication began using an electronic terminal to transmit its dispatches to a computer in New York by telephone , the federal police broke into its hotel room and accused its reporters of trying to send coded messages from the country. // The New York Times , hoping to avoid a similar incident , requested permission from Entel , the national telephone company , to use a similar device ; this was cheerfully granted . A half-hour after the bureau here began transmitting its news copy , the telephone company called and politely requested a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to maintain a detached bemusement when looking at their Government . The Argentines are a proud people - even haughty , their Latin American neighbors say - and so , for all its faults , the Government could not be all that bad. // " I ' ll tell you the problem , " a wealthy Argentine woman said as she dined with foreigners at Hippopotamus , a fashionable nouvelle cuisine restaurant and discotheque . " We are 28 million independent people - totally independent - and no one can work with the other. " // " We will never be able to govern ourselves , " she said . " The only way this country will ever be run well is by a triumvirate of Swiss. " //
