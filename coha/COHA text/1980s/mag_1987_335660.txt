The Soviet constitution is an impressive document . It allows freedom of the press , of assembly and of religion . Discrimination based on sex , race or nationality is forbidden . Every citizen has the right to a job , to " rest and leisure , " to free health care and education , to housing and even to such " cultural benefits " as television programs and books . <P> No wonder Soviet workers take off every Oct. 7 to celebrate the adoption of this generous charter . But the reality is that most of the Soviets ' political freedoms have never existed in practice or are locked in a straitjacket of limitations . Article 39 , for example , is a loophole as wide as the ruling regime wants to make it : " Enjoyment by citizens of their rights and freedoms must not be to the detriment of the interests of the society or the state . " <P> The text makes clear who decides those interests . The Communist Party , whose members include 6.7% of the nation 's 282 million people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nucleus of its political system . " That mandate is so broad the document does not even mention the groups that really run the country : the 14-member Politburo and the 307-strong Central Committee . <P> Unlike its U.S. counterpart , the Soviet charter is not the law against which other laws are judged . Instead , an exhaustive compendium of legal codes takes precedence , and the Soviet Supreme Court is not empowered to override such laws by invoking the constitution . " There is no system of checks and balances whereby the judiciary can say to the legislative branch , ' You ca n't do that , it 's against the constitution , " says Harold Berman , a Soviet legal expert at Emory University . <P> " If it is politically expedient , an individual 's rights will be sacrificed even though the constitution very clearly says he has those rights , " says Peter Maggs , a Soviet legal expert at the University of Illinois . " If there is a dissident who is making a nuisance of himself , the authorities will find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble to have a charter at all ? Though political freedoms are a glaring exception , the Soviet government does provide much of what the constitution promises : housing , education , pensions and cradle-to-grave security . And in the great majority of court cases , Maggs points out , " Soviet law , including constitutional rights , is applied the way it is supposed to be . " <P> The Soviets are living under their fourth constitution . The first , adopted in July 1918 , attempted to lay out the structure of the Soviet government without even mentioning the Communist Party . The 1924 constitution , which formally recognized the creation of the multinational Soviet Union , gave individual states the right to secede  --  a fiction that remains in the current text . The 1936 revision , known as the Stalin constitution , theoretically expanded personal freedoms at a time when the dictator 's Great Terror was sweeping the country . The current version was adopted in 1977 . One of its key changes : the right to sue the state , which has seldom been exercised but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reform of the Soviet legal code .
