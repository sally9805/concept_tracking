' ' An option buyer of puts and calls will lose money 80 percent of the time , ' ' asserts David L. Caplan , head of institutional options trading at Jesup &; Lamont Securities in Los Angeles . ' ' People liken commodity or stock index options trading to gambling . I tell them that ' s definitely not true - because in gambling you have a chance of winning , ' ' he says. // In two years , index options have become tremendously popular . Trading volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange is now second only to the New York Stock Exchange . The appeal : a relatively inexpensive bet on the direction of a market . An option buyer knows the most he can lose is the price of the option , but his potential winnings can be huge. // // But this is a zero-sum game . If most index options buyers are losing , who is winning ? ' ' On balance , although more risky , the sellers are the ones that make money , ' ' answers Jon Bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. in New York . Indeed , because institutions and brokerage houses have the time , the capital , and the computers to sell options most effectively , critics have derided index options as merely a way of shifting wealth from the unsophisticated to the sophisticated. // So how is the trading done ? There are probably hundreds of ways sellers can play index options profitably . In the last year , one strategy has gained some renown for making money when the markets go nowhere. // ' ' The ' strangle strategy , ' ' ' asserts Mr. Caplan , ' ' will make money for you over 80 percent of the time . ' ' ( Some other traders who have used the strategy suggest 70 percent is more accurate . ) In any case , Caplan explains that most of the time , stock , bond , and commodity markets are trendless or at least trade within a 5 to 10 percent range . When one stops to consider this , the investment community does spend oodles of time prognosticating and waiting for the market to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter the strangle ( or neutral option spread ) to take advantage of the doldrums . To set up a strangle , one sells both an out-of-the-money put and call . Out-of-the-money options are ones with strike ( exercise ) prices above or below the current market price . Suppose , for example , the Standard &; Poor ' s 100 stock index is at 180 . You sell a 190 call ( an option to buy ) and sell a 170 put ( option to sell ) ; both expire in a month . For the two options , the buyer pays perhaps $1 , 200 in premiums - prices fluctuate with traders ' expectations about the direction of the market. // ( Index options , if exercised , are settled in cash ; no stocks change hands . The value of the underlying option is set for each index . For example , an S &; P 100 option is worth , in dollar terms , 100 times the index . So if the index is at 180 , the underlying value of the option is $18 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between the strike price and the closing value of the index on the day the option is exercised. ) // If the market moves up , the call appreciates in value while the put decreases - and vice versa if the market turns south . So your position remains protected . As each day passes , however ( and the likelihood decreases that the market will reach either 170 or 190 ) , the premium loses some value . This time decay factor is how the strangle makes profits for the seller. // As one trader put it , an option is a shrinking asset . The put and call combination , which you sold for $1 , 200 , may only be worth $1 , 000 a week later . So if you turn around and buy it back , your gross profits at that point would be $200 . The less the market moves , the more the value of the call and put will drop , thus boosting the profit on both sides of the trade . If the option expires without being exercised , the $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn interest at Treasury-bill rates on the margin funds all sellers are required to deposit with their brokers and on the full $1 , 200 in premiums from the day of sale until you close out your position. // A key to making the strangle work is that out-of-the-money options tend to be ' ' overpriced . ' ' By using computers , options sellers can calculate when options are fetching too much . The more that speculators are willing to pay for these options , the greater the potential profits for sellers. // But it can be ' ' a bit like betting against the masses , ' ' says Mr. Bloom at Goldman , Sachs . The buyers are betting the market is going to be volatile , and you ' re selling and setting up strangles with the opposite belief , he says. // The rewards for playing chicken with the masses ? // Gerald Appel says he chalked up returns of about 25 percent annualized by running a stock index strangle ' ' almost continually ' ' last year . Bear in mind , most money managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely moved . With greater leverage , using more margin , he says returns could be higher . Mr. Appel is president of Signalert , a Great Neck , N.Y. , investment advisory concern with $40 million to $50 million under management ; he also publishes the Systems &; Forecasts newsletter. // When a person is margined to the 10 percent limit , Bloom says studies have shown it is possible to get 40 percent or more annualized returns on stock-index options . Caplan is one of the few who set up strangles in both commodities and stock indexes . And with admirable success . On Dec. 1 , 1984 , a $10 , 000 account was opened and the actual trades tracked in his newsletter , Opportunities in Options . The account , including commission fees , is up 53 percent as of March 1. // Says Appel : ' ' Dave ( Caplan ) uses close to minimum of margin . I don ' t , because every so often you ' re going to have a losing position . We usually have 40 spreads on a $300 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on $300 , 000 , plus the premiums . If you were margined to the limit , you could have 40 options spreads on a $60 , 000 account , but if you had to take losses you could lose half that amount in no time. ' ' // The strangle options game is more risky than buying options . The most you can make is the premium plus interest . The losses are potentially unlimited if you don ' t move your spreads or close out your position in time. // In January , when the market surged up , you could have lost a bundle sticking to strangles . ' ' A month like that could completely offset six months ' or a year ' s worth of gains , ' ' Bloom agrees. // Finally , like so many investment strategies , as more people discover the strangle , the less effective it becomes . Already , traders have noticed that markups on premiums have been less drastic , thus reducing profits. // So why talk to reporters ? Aren ' t you undermining future profits by publicizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculators ? // ' ' There ' s nothing I could possibly do to stop people from buying index options , ' ' says Caplan . ' ' It ' s just greed . The kind of thinking that even though everyone else lost , they will be the ones that hit it . They will outsmart the market. // ' ' On top of that you have brokers on television and in newsletters all over the country pushing options , ' ' he adds . ' ' And of course they want their clients to buy options because they get the commissions . A broker can make a lot more getting clients to buy options than sell them . You need a larger account to sell options , because there ' s margin . There ' s more risk involved in selling , and 9 out of 10 brokers don ' t know how to manage an option sale.
