txt South Korea 's industrial policy has often been pointed out as a successful example of a targeted national policy . Especially during the 1970s , the government played a central role in allocating resources in order to promote development of " strategic " industries In the last two years . however , the government 's view of this kind of targeting has changed considerably . and Korea is moving away from its old industrial policy toward a less active role in investment allocation . The Korean economy is now much too large and sophisticated to allow the degree of government intervention it has seen in the past . Economic conditions in Korea in the early 1960s were n't very different from Asia by Kim Kihwan those in any resource-poor , low-income developing country today . Korea , already overpopulated , had wide unemployment and high population growth . In 1961 , per capita GNP was 582 , and domestic savings were negligible . Korea had no significant exports and suffered from chronic balanceof-payments deficits . To deal with these problems the government adopted an outward-looking development strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to promote eco , nomic growth through the expansion of labor-intensive manufactured exports in which Korea had comparative advantage . Inefficient restrictions on interest rates were eliminated , the overvalued exchange rate was adjusted and tax incentives were granted for exporters to offset distortions caused by import barriers . In addition , administrative red-tape for export industries was reduced and customs procedures were simplified . The result of these measures surpassed all expectations . Export growth in 1961-71 averaged nearly 40% . Propelled by this export growth , real GNP grew at an annual rate of 93%. and inflation was kept relatively low . In the early 1970s , however . Korea 's development strategy shifted significantly . Partly as a result of rising protectionism against Korea 's labor-intensive manufactured exports , the government adopted a national industrial policy designed to accelerate the development of several specific industries , particularly steel , shipbuilding , machinery , electronics , nonferrous metals , power-generation equipment and petrochemicals  --  the so-called " strategic , " or heavy and chemical industries . Although the primary purpose was one to restructure exports in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitution to the extent that it increased domestic self-sufficiency in these industries . The strategic industries were given a wide variety of incentives , including preferential tax treatment , easy access to capital and protection against imports . Special funds and institutions were set up to channel investment into these industries , and loans were provided at favorable terms . The government pumped resources into the industries and , in the process , tampered extensively with the market mechanism through an over-valued local currency , artificially low interest rates and price controls . To a certain extent , this policy was successful . The targeted industries achieved truly phenomenal rates of growth and led the nation to an annual average GNP growth of 10.4% in 1979-79 . By 1982 , more than half of Korea 's exports came from the industries which had benefited from targeted government incentives . This success , however , was achieved at the cost of introducing serious structural imbalances into the economy . The excessively low cost of capital , for example , led to over-investment in heavy chemical industries , while untargeted small and medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of access to funds . In addition , the incentive system pushed the economy to grow rapidly , but the low interest rates on loans to many industries caused chronic excess demand for funds . This in turn stimulated the expansion of the domestic money supply and contributed to rapidly rising inflation . As the prices of daily necessities , produced for the most part by investment-starved small and medium industries , rose faster than the overall inflation rate , the cost of living for low-income households increased relatively more than that for high-income households . As a result Korea 's economic performance suffered , especially in 1979-80 when the country labored to recover from the triple blow of oil shock , political instability and world recession . As world trade volume dropped and Korea 's export expansion slowed , the problems caused by the industrial policy became apparent . Saddled with excess capacity in the heavy and chemical industries and lack of investment in the more traditional labor-intensive sectors , Korea experienced a premature loss of competitiveness in world markets for laborintensive light industrial goods . The basic message from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficiencies which eventually hurt economic performance . By creating a deep and prolonged gap between the real and the effective cost of capital in certain industries and by discriminating excessively among industries , the policies contributed to both a slowdown in export growth and adverse developments in equity and income distribution . Changes in the last few years reflect the government 's desire to rely more on the free-market allocation of resources . The policy of extending preferential access to credit and treatment in taxation to strategic Industries is being phased out . In as place the government is moving toward an incentive system which is neutral with regard to firms and industries and which will allow the effective cost of capital to more accurately reflect the true cost . Several major reforms are under way . The most Important is the liberalization of the financial market . The government has denationalized the five major commercial banks and is lifting restrictions on competition among different types of financial Institutions . In addition , it is acting to increase the flow of funds to small and medium industries to correct the imbalances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being revised to give more equitable treatment to different industries . The fairly complicated interest-rate structure has been simplified . The new policies seem to be working . Korea achieved 6.4% growth in 1981 and 5.3% in 1982 , in spite of the global recession . During the past two years Korea also made outstanding progress toward price stability . The inflation rate measured in wholesale prices was 2.4% , and in consumer prices , 4.8% in 1982 . This year , the economy is expected to grow about 8% , with 1% to 2% inflation . Korea holds some lessons for other countries considering similar incentive systems . However , the lessons may not be what some people believe them to be . In particular , for any economy which is as large or complex as Korea 's , it seems best not to overrate the government 's ability to implement a targeted national industrial policy that will produce better results than those yielded by the efficient operation of the free market .
