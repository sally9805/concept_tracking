FRANCE After two years of Socialism , the mood turns testy and resentful <P> On May 10 , 1981 , youthful Frenchmen were careering jubilantly through the streets of Paris , trailing red flags from their cars and chanting , " We 've won ! We 've won ! " Standing in the chill spring rain at the Place de la Bastille , others laughingly shouted , " Mitterrand , give us some sun ! " Even as a joke , that demand was a measure of the Impossible hopes raised by French President Franois Mitterrand 's election victory two years ago , a historic occasion that brought to an end 23 years of conservative rule . <P> Last week , though , neither Mitterrand nor his ruling Socialist Party observed the second anniversary of his mandate with so much as a public toast or official reference . Any celebrations , in fact , would have been unseemly in the face of widespread disillusionment in France that , under the pressure of economic austerity , is deepening into a testy , resentful mood . On this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students protesting education reforms . Instead of red flags and roses , they carried anti-government placards and , occasionally , crowbars to use against riot police . <P> Once again , spring was bringing forth the strains and tensions of a society that never has accepted easily the constraints of government or the call for sacrifice in the national interest . Clouds of tear gas rising over the center of Paris , gangs of masked students clashing with riot police in the Latin Quarter , banner-bearing protest marchers , including farmers , doctors , teachers , retailers and small businessmen-all these signs of widespread unrest seemed disturbingly familiar to many Frenchmen . There were nagging fears of a repetition of the popular upheaval in May 1968 that rocked Charles de Gaulle 's regime to its foundations and led to his departure from office a year later . Was the same thing now happening , in reverse , to a Socialist President ? <P> The answer , according to government officials , leaders of the opposition and even most of the demonstrators , was that history was not repeating itself . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear little resemblance to those of 1968 . Above all , this time militant students lack the support of the unions and workers , who tend to regard them as part of the privileged bourgeois elite . Alain Krivine , one of the leaders of the 1968 uprising and now head of a Trotskyite splinter party , recalled that " we had 60,000 to 70,000 students in the streets . " In the past three weeks , fewer than 10,000 students have turned out for any given protest . Said Krivine : " Today 's movement is divided between left and right . It is reformist , while ours was an explosion against a whole society . "
