A MATTER OF TASTE J r/ dolph ( Rudy ) Coniglio says his trouble began on the night of July 27 , 1969 , a Sunday . He was then 53 years old and the proprietor of a restaurant called Rudy 's Pizza , in Closter , New Jersey . He remembers : " Two of my people , the cleaners , they did n't show up that night to clean . So I stayed after closing and did the cleaning myself . I did the kitchen , the counter , the dining room , where I got 20 tables  --  I did it all . So I perspired even in that air-conditioned place , and I got so hot that I did n't sleep good all night . So I got up the next morning with this heavy cold and fever . I do n't feel good . So my wife goes down to run the place , and I went over to this doctor  --  this local , family doctor  --  and he prescribed some yellow antibiotic pills . I took those pills and stayed three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the restaurant . I got there early , and I felt all right . Not bad . So I start to work in the window up front and make some pizza dough . Pizza is my specialty , I make it all myself . Well , now the dough is rising good , so I get out some tomatoes and the other stuff for a pizza alio napoletana . All of a sudden , I start to smell something funny . Something bad . I 'm peeling a tomato , and I smell it . It smells rotten . It smells like garbage . Then I taste it . It has the taste of garbage . I call the wholesaler , and I 'm mad . What 's the matter , you send me rotten tomatoes ? He says I 'm crazy  --  he do n't handle rotten tomatoes . Now he 's mad . I hang up and go out to the kitchen to find some good tomatoes . But  --  oh , my God ! Did you ever when you 're a kid burn a plastic comb ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out . I went back to the front , and it was just as bad . That smell  --  that garbage stink . Some of my people were coming in , and I told them , but they do n't smell nothing . So it must be me . It must be that heavy cold . " I figure I 'm still sick . So I got my car and went home . The street was almost as bad as the place  --  the exhaust fumes . It was the same stink . It was better at home . Some . But not much . My wife went down to the restaurant again . I went outdoors , out in the backyard . It was better there than in the house , but it had a smell . The grass had a smell . It smelled like regular grass  --  only 20 times stronger than normal . It smelled so strong it smelled bad . Igot some woods behind my house , so I tried there . That was better . It was okay . I tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat down on a log , and it was nice sitting there , so after a while I lit a cigarette . Oh , my God ! The smell was like everything else  --  and the taste ! It burned on my tongue like a hot pep-per . So I do n't have anything to do but just sit in the woods . I stayed there all day . When it was time for dinner , I could n't eat . Everything had that stink . I thought I might as well go to bed . I got ready and laid down , but I had to sit up . The pillow  --  it smelled like dirt . So my wife went out to the store and bought a new pillow . It had a smell , but it was n't too much . But I had to sleep on my back . I could n't have my face in the pillow . So the next day I went back to the doctor . " The doctor was surprised . But he thought like me  --  it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a new prescrip-tion , for some pink antibiotic pills , and said to come back in a couple days . But the pills did n't help . I went back to the doctor . He told me to wait a while . Be patient . So I had to hire somebody to run my place . All I could do was stand in the woods all day . Of course , I had to eat  --  I did n't want to die . But the regular food  --  it was all like gar-bage . I could drink a little cold milk . I could eat a little cold boiled potato . I could eat a white grape . I could eat a little vanilla ice cream . That stuff , it did n't taste good , but it did n't taste bad . It did n't have any taste at all . So I lived on that . No coffee  --  God forbid . Even a ba-nana ? / could n't go near it . I went back to the doctor again , and he sent me to another doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my nose , and he took some x-rays , but he could n't find anything wrong . He called the family doctor and said , this Rudy , what he needs is psychiatry , his trouble is psychosomatic . He sent me to a psychiatrist . So the psychiatrist started talking about my life history  --  did I like my work ? My God , I love my work . I listened , and I went out , and I did n't go back . Well , now it was almost September . I was n't any better , I was losing weight , and the only time I was comfortable was out in the woods . So I decided to go to Italy . My mother is there , and I thought maybe the Italian doctors could help me , I went to Naples and saw a doctor there , and I went to a doctor in Rome . But they were the same as at home . It was all in my mind , Did I like my work ? They gave me some tranquilizer pills . Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and came back home in October . " By this time , I do n't know what to think . Am I crazy ? Maybe those doctors , they 're right . They keep saying it 's my mind . Or maybe they 're making me crazy . I try another doctor . Not in Closter  --  in another Jersey town . This doctor looks at my nose with a needle , and a little blood comes out . Ah , he says , I know what you got . You need an operation . So he gives me a date . But I do n't take his word . I go to another doctor next day . He says he first wants x-rays . But I just had x-rays yesterday . He wants to know who , and I tell him , and he calls that doctor and they talk . Then he looks at my nose again , and he finds where the needle touched me . Ah , he says  --  that 's it . You got a tumor . Very serious . Operate at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop dead . Then I thought I better kill myself . I 've lost 40 pounds of weight , and I 've spent a hell of a lot of money , and now I 've got a tumor in my nose . But , thank God , I 've got a neighbor friend . His job is hospital administrator at a big hospital in New York , in Manhattan . I talk with him sometimes , and so one day  --  this is maybe December  --  he says , maybe you better try my hospital . He says they 've got good men , and so he arranges everything and I get a date . So I walk in the hospital , and they'rewaiting for me  --  three doctors . Everything is organized right . But first another x-ray . Okay . And then  --  my God , good news . The head doctor says no tumor . They do n't find anything . But the head doctor is interested . He says he wants to see me in his office . He 's got a private office up around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We visited and talked for an hour . He could n't find what was wrong . He ordered me again some pills and a spray for my nose . He says to come back in a couple days so he can see the reaction . But he do n't find any reaction . No better . No change . So then I tell him what I 'm worried about . I say , listen , doctor  --  they send me to all these psychiatrists , and they talk about psychosomatic . I say , I 'm willing to go to the crazy house . I do n't care anymore . I had enough . But I want to ask one thing . Do crazy people have their food taste like garbage ? And the doctor says no . He says they eat like everybody else . He says , I do n't know the trouble with you , but I know one thing . You 're not crazy . " That made me feel better , so I was ready to go . But he said wait a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he knew a man who could . He said there was a doctor down in Washington , a specialist at the National Institutes of Health , who was coming up to New York pretty soon . He wanted me to see him . So I went home and waited . At least I was n't crazy . But I still ca n't eat or work or do anything but go out and stand in the woods . It 's Christmastime , and I 'm living like a dog . Well , I wait a couple weeks , then I get the call . There 's a Dr. Gould , with an office on 77th Street , and this man from Washington is waiting for me there . So I go over and meet him  --  Dr. Henkin , of the National Institutes of Health . He takes me into a little room . I talk and he listens . Then he says , openyour mouth . So I open . Stick your tongue out . So I do , and he puts a drop of something on my tongue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell him , No taste at all . ' Good , ' he says ? ' Now I know what you got . But I ca n't treat you here . You 've got to come down to the Institutes of Health . ' My God , I did n't know it then , but there was a god . That 's all I can say about Dr. Henkin . He 's a god . " Dr. Henkin is Dr. Robert I. Hen-kin . He was at that time chief of the Section of Neuroendocrinology , Experimental Therapeutics Branch , of the National Heart and Lung Institute of the National Institutes of Health , in Bethesda , Maryland , an appointment he had held since July of 1969 . Since 1975 , he has been director of the Center for Molecular Nutrition and Sensory Disorders at the Georgetown University Medical Center , in Washington , D.C. He says : " Well , I thought I knew what Rudy 's trouble was . I thought he had what we call idiopathic hypogeusia . It 's a condition that involves a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is often accompanied by a distortion of taste and smell . The cause is unknown , or idiopathic . The reason I suspected it in Rudy was simply that I had it on my mind . I had seen the same condition twice before  --  and only a few weeks earlier . Aberrations of taste and smell are not , of course , at all unusual . They are common symptoms of the common cold . And hepatitis . And pregnancy . But my introduction to idiopathic hypogeusia was entirely accidental . I had occasion to mention the loss of taste acuity , with a related distortion of taste and smell , in a refresher training course in the basic sciences that I was teaching at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in the fall of 1969 . It was sometime in early September . Well , about a month later , I got a call from one of the officers who had taken the course  --  an Air Force colonel down in Texas . He had a patient at his base he thought I might want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's complaint was pretty much what I had been talking about . Everything he ate or drank smelled and tasted foul . But he did n't have a cold , he did n't have hepatitis  --  he seemed in every other respect to be in normal good health . I said I was very much interested . I said to send him right up . " Mack came into the N.I.H. clinical center on October 18 . He was 46 years old and a big , powerful man . He said he had lost some weight in recent months , but he still weighed a good 200 pounds . We gave him the usual workup , including neurological and ear-nose-and-throat evaluations , and the results were , as we say , uneventful . He was a little hard of hearing from working around airplanes , but that was all . He was , in general , in excellent health . I sat down with him , and we had a long talk . His trouble had come on gradually . Back in June , he said , he began to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to notice that meats of all kind also tasted peculiar  --  tasted as if they had been cooked in rancid grease . Then other foods began to taste bad . Vegetables had an ' iron and tinny ' taste . Cigarettes smelled like Vick 's Vapo-Rub . For the past three or four months , he had been living on lettuce , cottage cheese , milk and ice cream . It was weird  --  fantastic . I wondered if he might be crazy . I 'd never heard of such a thing except as a manifestation of some other and demonstrable disease . I took him down to the hospital kitchen . I got out a cold roast of beef and cut off a beautiful slice and asked him just to taste it . I 've never seen such a look of revulsion . He said he would n't , he could n't  --  he would vomit . Just the smell of it made him feel sick . I took him back to his room . I had to believe him  --  but I certainly had something to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a study I 'd been involved in a couple of years before that a substance called D-penicillamine can diminish taste acuity and even distort taste . This has happened a number of times to patients being treated with that drug for various diseases  --  rheumatoid arthritis , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , scleroderma . When Dpenicillamine was discontinued , normal taste returned . Our study also showed that the administration of D-penicillamine was usually followed by a drop in the concentration of copper in the blood . We treated those patients with supple mental copper , in the form of copper sulphate , and normal taste returned . That certainly suggested that copper might play a role in the physiology of taste . We then began to wonder about the possibility of a similar role for other metals that are minutely present in the body  --  zinc , for example . We tried the same experiment again , only this time using zinc sulphate instead of copper . We got the same result . Normal taste returned . Well , with that in mind , I arranged to measure the levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which was done . And the results were normal . There was no decrease at all . " That was rather a shock . I had been all set to start him on one of those metals  --  probably zinc . It has a very low toxicity . So now what ? But I still wanted to do something . And I thought , what 's the harm  --  why not try it anyway ? So I wrote out an order for oral zinc sulphate ? 400 mg a day . And what happened ? It was really quite dramatic . Two days later , he said things did n't seem to smell as bad as they had . The next day , there was more improvement , and the day after that , I dragged him down to the kitchen again and offered him another slice of roast beef . He ate a couple of bites , and said it did n't taste too bad . A few more days , and his taste was back to normal . He was well . It was a gratifying recovery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never less than normal , and yet he had  --  or seemed to have  --  a certain zinc deficiency . I wondered if something could happen to deplete the supply of zinc in a specific area  --  as in the taste buds on the tongue . In any event , the zinc had seemed to work . Mack was discharged on November 4 with a good supply of pills , and that was the end of him as far as I was concerned . I never heard of him again . " I did n't forget him , though . That would n't have been possible . And for several reasons . One was this . I have an old friend , an English colleague , and about a week after Mack went back to Texas , my friend ? I 'll call him Wilson  --  turned up in Washington on his way out West somewhere . I had n't seen him for a couple of years , and I picked him up at his hotel and drove him home to dinner . On the way , I happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought Wilson acted a little strange . He cleared his throat and looked a bit embarrassed . Finally , he said something about not eating much these days . He wondered if he might have something very light  --  a little cottage cheese , perhaps , and some lettuce . The truth was , he said , he could n't eat meat anymore . He could n't stand the smell of it . As a mat-ter of fact , there were very few foods that did n't have a most un-pleasant smell . It was like talking to Sergeant Mack . I asked him how long this had been going on . A cou-ple of years , he said . It was a nui-sance , but he had learned to live with it . I felt  --  it 's hard to say how I felt . But I said I thought I might be able to help him . He gave me a hopeless look . I asked him if he would let me try . Would he come in-to the hospital for a week or two ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but  --  all right . I made the arrangements , and he came in , and we worked him up very thoroughly to exclude any other possibilities ? liver disease , a tumor , all the rest . We found nothing . He was normal in every way but one . His serum-zinc level was down . I put him on placebos for three days . If he im-proved on placebos , which are noth-ing but sugar pills , that would strongly suggest that his problem was functional  --  was rooted in some emotional disturbance . There was , however , no change . Then I started him on oral zinc . It was n't like Sergeant Mack  --  it was n't in the least dramatic . But after four or five days his serum zinc began to rise . His sense of smell improved . He could eat a little something  --  an egg , a slice of meat . But then he had to leave . He could n't postpone his en-gagements any longer . I discharged him on November 17 . I gave him a supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . We were using it in an entirely experimental setting . The official view is spelled out in the standard text The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics , which says , The systemic actions of zinc have no therapeutic application . . . . All drugs must by law have a specific use . Zinc is not recognized as having any usefulness internally except as an emetic . ' Well , Wilson went on his way , but he called me a few weeks later , just before flying back to England . He had continued to improve . He was n't all the way back to normal , but he felt enormously better . " And that was when I heard about Rudy Coniglio . A friend and colleague named Wilbur James Gould made the arrangements , and I went up to New York and saw him . It sounded like the same sort of thing . I gave him a drop of relatively concentrated hydrochloric acid . This is a compound that normal people find extremely sour . But Rudy did n't bat an eye . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank him with Sergeant Mack and Dr. Wilson , but it was more than a little suggestive . I certainly wanted to know a bit more . Those first two cases had merely whetted my curiosity . I was really interested now . So I got Rudy into the Bethesda clinical center as soon as I could  --  on January 11 . We started with a very comprehensive workup  --  all the routine tests , plus a skull series , EEG , brain scan , sinus series , a neurological examination , an ophthalmological study , copper and zinc evaluations and a tongue biopsy . An examination of tongue tissue could tell me if there had been any anatomical changes in the area of the taste buds . The test results were essentially normal  --  all but the trace-metal evaluations and the tongue biopsy . Zinc and copper  --  serum and urinary both  --  were low . On the fifth hospital day , I started Rudy on oral zinc sulphate : 400 mg a day . There was some improvement by the end of the first week , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when I saw the results of the tongue biopsy . They were quite impressive  --  startling , even . The normal structure of the taste buds was almost totally absent . I was looking at the pictures  --  the photographic enlargements of Rudy 's electronmicroscope examination  --  and you could n't miss it . The taste buds looked frayed , worn down , motheaten . But now it was two weeks later . So I made another tongue biopsy . And waited with some impatience for the results . They were very interesting indeed . They looked like a normal tongue . Very close to it , anyway . Rudy had left by then . I had discharged him on January 31 , with the usual supply of pills . I asked him to call me in a couple of months to keep me posted on his progress , and I also arranged for him to come back to the center in July for another checkup . He called me in March . He was taking his 400 mg of zinc sulphate every day , and he was fine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 12 , he came into the clinical center again , and he stayed a little over a week , until July 21 . His trouble seemed to be completely under control . But I wanted to follow him -- I had lost track of Mack , and Wilson was back in England . I wanted to be sure , so I made arrangements to see him again in another three months or so . " Mr. Coniglio says : " I wonder how many people went into the crazy house with this thing I had . I mean , years back  --  before Dr. Hen-kin . I bet plenty . I was almost there myself . But Dr. Henkin fixed me up . 1 came back home that second time from the hospital , and I never felt better in my life . It was even better than the first . I felt better in my mind . For almost a year now , I could eat and drink and work at my place . I had a normal life . But I think it was around the beginning of October that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slow . At first , I do n't believe it . But things are beginning to smell again . They stink . I 'm taking the pills , but I 'm losing . They do n't do any good . Oh , my God  --  I 'm scared . It was n't as bad as before , thank God , but I know that smell and that garbage taste . I know I 'm going backward . I can still work , but my nerves are bad , and I think maybe I better sell out  --  get rid of the place before I get worse . So I did . I sold Rudy 's . I did all right  --  I got a good price . But the way I 'm feeling , I do n't really care too much . Because it is getting close to time for me to go back to the hospital . I got to go back , and I do n't know what I 'm going to say to Dr. Henkin . He thinks I 'm cured . He thinks he made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to see him . You know , I 'm embarrassed . But the time came , and I got the appointment letter and I went down to Bethesda and Dr. Henkin came in and I told him . And he laughed . " Dr. Henkin says : " Laughed ? I do n't know  --  maybe I did . But it was n't because I was amused . If I laughed , it could only have been from relief . I was pleased . Rudy had confirmed an important hypothesis . Maybe I was a little embarrassed , continued on page 108 Medical Mailbox continued from page 107 Medical Center has one on order . Cardiologists are predicting they will be able to see plaque build-up in heart vessels without injecting contrast material or using radiation . With the equipment , the physician can see through the skull to look at damage from a stroke or a brain tumor . Researchers in psychiatry will be able to look at brains after ECT and ascertain whether or not shrinking of brain tissue has occurred . What makes NMR so remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears to be completely safe . L-Lysine Treatment Dr. Richard Griffith continues to pursue his studies on the use of lysine for herpes patients . He has discovered that , for the treatment of active disease , 500 milligrams of L-lysine for every 10 pounds of body weight is an effective dosage . In the rare instances that this proves to be too much , a slight burning sensation during urination might result . In that event , he asks his patients to lessen their lysine intake slightly until the burning disappears . Word is beginning to circulate among physicians that lysine used intravenously has successfully treated the highly fatal herpes encephalitis . The work has not yet appeared in professional journals . Virus Research Research from the National Institutes of Health has revealed that vaccination with an attenuated strain of Herpesvirus saimiri , which causes cancer in nonhuman primates , has effectively protected laboratory animals exposed to the virulent strain of the virus . Success of the vaccine in animals validates the concept of boosting an organism 's natural defenses to protect against herpes simplex , according to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard University and codeveloper ofthe vaccine . Dr. Falk and his colleagues tested the effect of human interferons in tissue culture on herpes viruses . Low concentrations of interferon inhibited growth of the virus , but when interferon was withdrawn from the infected cell cultures , viral replication recurred . By using large doses of interferon , they were able to cure infected cell cultures that had been extensively damaged by the oncogenic ( cancer causing ) viruses , allowing the culture to repopulate with healthy cells , according to Dr. Falk . Dr. Falk said that researchers prefer to use herpes viruses that cause cancer when testing the effect of vaccines and drugs , because the signs of the disease are unmistakable and long lasting . Other diseases caused by the herpes viruses , such as lesions , are transient and difficult to document . " Though the potential of herpes viruses to cause cancer in nonhuman primates is undisputed , only suspicions and a controversial statistical study link the viruses to human cancer , " stated a report by the National Institutes of Health .

Antibodies to the Herpesvirus saimiri antigens were detected as early as 10 days after vaccination with the weaker strain . Taste continued from page 69 too . Rudy 's suffering those past few weeks was all my fault . He should , of course , have called me when the first symptoms returned . That 's what I told him to do . I realize now why he did n't  --  he did n't want to disappoint me . Which tells you a lot about Rudy . It was terrible that he did n't call . I could have helped him right away . Be-cause the pills I sent him off with in July were not zinc-sulphate pills . They were placebos . That was some-thing I had to do . This is a research hospital . My work is clinical research . Sergeant Mack had dropped out of sight , and Dr. Wilson was in England . But I still had Rudy . He gave me an op-portunity I had to take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were truly in re-sponse to medication  --  if it was n't a matter of spon-taneous remission or a psy-chosomatic response to a sympathetic hospital and medical situation . And now I was sure  --  reasonably sure . It was only necessary to put Rudy back on the old regimen . Which I did . And then I was sure . In Rudy 's case , at any rate , oral zinc sulphate , at 400 mg a day , was genuinely therapeutic . " Adolph ( Rudy ) Coniglio has the distinction of being the first victim of idiopathic hypogeusia whose experience has been recorded in definitive detail . He thus is classically commemorated in the infant annals of the disease . He is , however , no longer alone in affliction . Others  --  many others  --  have since followed his enigmatic footsteps . More than 10,000 cases of taste and smell dysfunctions are now known to Dr. Henkin from correspondence with colleagues throughout the United States , and some 1,500 more have been diagnosed , attended to and treated by him and his associates in Bethesda and Georgetown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I 'm inclined to think that those cases we have on record are only a fraction of the real total . I 'll tell you why . Fifty-five of the cases we saw at the clinical center were our own people  --  National Institutes of Health employees . There were around 10,000 men and women working in one or another of the several institutes , and 55 cases gave us an incidence rate of roughly one in 180 . Now , let 's project that on a national population of more than 200 million . And what do we get ? It suggests that more than one million Americans are suffering from hypogeusia or its related disorders . That really is a lot of cases . I think it 's a reasonable figure , though . Hypogeusia is n't a new disease , of course . It 's been around for a long , long time . It 's merely a newly discovered disease . I think loss of taste is probably just as historical an affliction as loss of sight or hearing . But we do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized . Remember all those doctors who thought Rudy Coniglio 's trouble was psychosomatic ? " So we 're beginning to get somewhere . I think zinc sulphate is therapeutic . It works  --  not always , less often than we would like , but often enough to prove its worth . We 're beginning to understand that problem . We understand , at any rate , that it is an immensely complicated one . But treatment is n't all . We 've also been learning something about the nature of the disease . One thing we know is this : As a group , the victims of hypogeusia are measurably deficient in zinc . There are a number of conditions that can bring about hypogeusia . We know it can happen in pregnancy  --  perhaps because a portion of the mother 's zinc is transferred to the baby . We know it can be brought about by head injury , by a fall or a blow . We know it occurs in cancer  --  I 've seen it in my own experience . About ten percent of the patients we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found to have cancer . Which raises an interesting question . Is hypogeusia a disease ? Or a symptom ? Hypogeusia and its related disorders occur in a variety of infectious diseases . Hepatitis is one . Flu is another . About half the people in whom we have confirmed a continued on following page // Taste continued from page 109 loss and distortion of taste and smell developed the disorder following an attack of flu . Like Rudy  --  Rudy is our model case . Another group of our patients developed aberrations of taste and smell after some surgical procedure . I do n't know why . Maybe stress is a factor . That casts some possible light on a rather familiar phenomenon . Postoperative patients are always complaining about the quality of hospital food . Can all hospital kitchens be that bad ? Or could it be the patients ' sense of taste ? I wonder . And then we have a third group . These are the patients whose hypogeusia is truly idiopathic . We ca n't find any precipitating insult . I think we will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A team of pediatricians at the University of Colorado Medical Center , in Denver , has reported some interesting findings . They examined a group of 132 boys and girls with ages ranging from four to 16 . Zinc concentrations were normal for all but nine of the group . Seven of the nine were found to be below normal in both height and weight , and they also reported poor appetite . They were then tested for taste acuity . All were found to be suffering from hypogeusia . They then were treated with oral zinc sulphate . Normal taste acuity returned . Other studies , here and elsewhere , have confirmed our conviction that zinc can be a crucial factor . One of our studies involved a group of normal people  --  volunteers . We biochemically depleted their body zinc . We used an essential amino acid called L-histidine , which has the power to strip zinc from its binding proteins and excrete it through the urine . The immediate effect of depletion was appetite loss . That was followed by a loss of taste and smell . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed the condition , even in the face of continued administration of L-histidine . So once more , zinc emerged as a major marker for normal taste acuity . " Much of what we feel we have learned has come from a double-blind test that we staged in 1973 at the N.I.H. The true effectiveness of a drug can best be established in a double-blind test . The test we did on Rudy was a single-blind : The patient did n't know the nature of the drug he was given , but the doctor did . In a double-blind test , the true drug and the placebo are delivered to the clinician in containers labeled in a code known only to the investigator who prepared the medication . The doctor is as blind as the patient  --  he told you Harold did n't photograph wear ca n't anticipate results . Our double-blind test involved a group of 106 patients . Half of them were given placebos , and the other half got zinc sulphate . The results were a shock . Some of the people on placebos got better . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And some did n't . Statistically , we could not distinguish between the group that got placebos and the group that got the zinc . We could n't believe our eyes . What was going on here ? We thought we had been put back to zero . Then we calmed down and took a closer look at the data and we got a clue . In a single-blind test , we give the patient the placebo first , and if there is no response we then try zinc . If , however , he responds to the placebo , we drop him from the study . A placebo response suggests that other factors are involved  --  maybe a functional debility , maybe a psychosomatic problem . In any event , when we dropped the placebo responders from the double-blind study we ended up with results much like those of our single-blind tests . So we had another confirmation . But the study actually gave us something more than that . It encouraged us to reconsider , to rethink . We realized that there is a great diversity of taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were forced to conclude that zinc is no magic bullet . That is to say , it is a drug like other drugs . Magic bullets are rarer than people like to think . There are , for example , insulin-resistant diabetics . And the famous antibiotics are far from being comprehensively effective . " We were also en-couraged by the study to reconsider some of our criteria . We had been us-ing serum-zinc levels ? the concentration of zinc in the blood  --  to measure both zinc deficiency and the response to zinc therapy . We decided that there might be a more definitive approach . We had plenty of room to maneuver in . The phe-nomenon of taste has never been of very great interest to medicine . The reason probably is that its pathology had never seemed to have much di-agnostic value . Not like vision , for example , or hearing . Consequently , very little is known about the me-chanics of taste . The conventional explanation supposes it to be entire-ly a neural process . Our studies have suggested a different explanation . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't know just how this chemical information is then translated into electric signals to the brain or how those signals are coded to define the basic qualities of salt , sweet , sour and bitter . But we do know that taste is initiated at the taste buds , of which there are more than 1,000 in the oral cavity . We thought that zinc must be present in the bud . But then the question arose : How does the zinc get there ? Well , the first possibility that came to mind was the obvious one  --  the saliva . Saliva serves the oral cavity as blood serves the rest of the body . We decided that our next move would be a study // of the saliva . " That took a little time . We had to develop a technique for measuring zinc in the saliva . What we did finally was adapt an **36;4422;TOOLONG technique to measure the tiny amounts of zinc involved . We isolated the zinc-containing protein in saliva , and named it gustin . Gustin is responsible for the growth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is diminished in concentration . The result of our work was to establish that zinc is one essential of the taste process . And realizing that enabled us to revise our clinical thinking . We had made the mistake of using the serum-zinc concentration as a diagnostic measure . But now we know better . We now measure salivary zinc  --  and with notably accurate results . We find in an impressive number of cases that victims of hypogeusia have a low level of salivary zinc . And we find that an impressive number of such cases respond to zinc therapy . The salivary-zinc level goes up . And taste acuity returns . We 're beginning to know who we can help  --  and who we ca n't . We 've still got a long way to go . But I think we 're over the hump . " I mentioned that more than a million Americans are suffering from some form of taste or smell dysfunction . That 's a lot of people , and problems of taste are very disagreeable problems . Eating is a basic pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two basic pleasures in life . We 're being told now that the pleasures of sex may well be enjoyed into very ripe old age , and I hope it is true . But it is certain that eating is with us all the years of our life . A life without pleasure in eating ? a life in which nothing tastes good and much tastes awful  --  would be hard to endure . We hope that we 're on the way to bringing help to those unhappy people who are forced to endure it . Oh , there 's so much ahead of us . I 'm an activist and an enthusiast , and the potential in our work could hardly be more exciting . We 're on the threshold of a new technology . I 'm thinking beyond the treatment of hypogeusia  --  important as that is . I 'm thinking , for example , of the day when we can order the chemistry of saliva in such a way as to prevent dental caries and gum disease . I 'm also thinking of what a fuller knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . We know now that the taste receptors can be manipulated . Sour or bitter can be made to taste sweet . Think what the refinement and application of that phenomenon would mean to the diabetic , the obese , the hypertensive , the heart sufferer . Sweetness without sugar , sweetness without sweeteners . No more worries about saccharin or the cyclamates . Think  --  just think  --  how happy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would be ! " A
