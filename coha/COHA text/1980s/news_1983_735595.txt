txt Recently . at a dinner party , some of us agreed on how much we admired the books of Dr. Lewis Thomas . " Well I do n't ! " asserted another guest . He was a professor of zoology. specifically an authority on snails . Citing the title piece of Dr. Thomas 's second small book of essays , " The Medusa and the Snail . " the professor averred , " He does n't know anything about snails . He 's read the wrong books . " In the ensuing talk , the dissenter did concede that Dr. Thomas 's first book " The Lives of a Cell , " might be all right --  " That 's his field . " I think the episode was an instance of the Toynbee syndrome , a pattern in which historians specializing in particular segments of the vast sweep of civilizations that Arnold Toynbee discusses , sometimes foam at the mouth over alleged errors in their own fields . In the proverbial friction between specialist and generalist , the specialist knows more and more about less and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more . Dr. Thomas wrote very little about snails , but managed to tread on the toes of at least one malacologist ( snail specialist ) . An error , if demonstrated , is an error , yet the challenge may miss the point . Dr. Thomas , in all of his nontechnical essays , writes as a wisely witty , literate , cultivated philosopher , linking many aspects of science to the life experiences of all of us . If he read the wrong book on snails , he reads well the book of life , and that Is his subject . Lewis Thomas is president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York . He is a bacteriologist , immunologist , biologist , pathologist , physician , administrator and something more than the sum of those parts . A man of modesty and candor , he speaks good-humoredly of numerouschallenges to the ideas , or details , of some of his essays  --  this in his new book , which has the essential appealing qualities of , yet is structurally different from , the essays . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 270 pages , $14.75 ) , is the chronicle of his life in medicine . The third in the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Series , devoted to encouraging public understanding of science , it follows " Disturbing the Universe . " by physicist Freeman Dyson. and " Advice to a Young Scientist , " by immunologist and Nobel laureate Sir Peter Medawar . In regard to the title of his present book , Dr. Thomas will kick up some controversy by contending that those varied practices from time immemorial , which we have called the healing arts , truly became " a technology based on genuine science " only as of about 1937 with " the explosive news of sulfanilamide , and the start of the real revolution in medicine . " ( I was an early beneficiary , threatened by peritonitis from a burst appendix , having sulfanilamide powder sprinkled in my wound as from a flour shaker . ) Medicine 's technological marvels now range from heart and other organ transplants , to artificial hearts , dialysis machines . CAT scanners and the new magnetic scanners . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , and less touching of patients by physicians , the classical " laying on of hands , " which he feels had no small part in healing . Still , he has immense pride in the benefits that the technological marvels can bestow . Yet , he is ambivalent . Nurses inherit that manual contact with the patient . In a chapter on nursing , he says , " My discovery , as a patient first on the medical service and later in surgery , is that the institution ( the hospital ) is held together , glued together , enabled to function as an organism , by the nurses and by nobody else . . . . I am all for the nurses . If they are to continue their professional feud with the doctors .. , I am on their side . " He has been a worried patient , in medicine and surgery , in his own great hospital ( he turned out not to have cancer ) , and reflects : " One of the hard things to learn in medicine , even harder to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Every young doctor should know exactly what it is like to have things go catastrophically wrong , and to be personally mortal . It makes for a better practice . " As for the organs of his own body : " I do not at all resent any of the parts for going wrong . . . . having seen what they are up against , I have more respect for them than I had before . " There are affecting glimpses of his rich bonds of companionship with his wife , Beryl . He gives a warm portrait of his parents , the father a dedicated doctor , the mother , a nurse . In their time , " the practice of medicine was accepted to be a chancy way to make a living , and nobody expected a doctor to get rich , least of all the doctors themselves . " ( " All changed , changed utterly , " in words from Yeats . ) He gives special praise to New York 's Bellevue Hospital , where he once directed clinical services . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide the best of all possible medical care for the sickest of patients under the worst of conditions . If you could make it at Bellevue , you could thereafter cope with almost anything . " Of the new Bellevue : " If I were to be taken sick in a taxicab . . . or struck down on a New York street . I would want to be taken there . " A chapter of value to any medical or educational administrator is " The Governance of a University , " specifically bearing on those with medical schools . A cautious optimist , he yet goes so far as : " I look for the end of cancer before this century is over . " In general philosophy : " In real life , research is dependent on the human capacity for making predictions that are wrong , and on the even more human gift for bouncing back to try again . . . . A successful child is one who has learned so thoroughly about his own fallibility that he can never forget it , all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own uniquely top form in " The Youngest Science .
