Christopher Whittle has a high-tech answer for the problem of cultural illiteracy among American students . Beginning next month , his Knoxville-based Whittle Communications firm will beam Channel One , a slick news program for teenagers , directly into schools for a seven-week test period . Whittle has provided each of the six pilot schools with $50,000 worth of television sets and satellite equipment to use as they wish . The only requirement : each day students will have to watch a twelve-minute Channel One broadcast  --  including two minutes of ads . <P> Whittle 's plan to introduce commercial television into the classroom has sparked considerable controversy . " I think it 's appalling and greedy , " says Arnold Fege of the national PTA . Whittle counters that the venture will not only inform students about current events but also provide schools with valuable hardware to increase learning opportunities . " The equipment we install has enormous secondary benefits , " he claims . <P> Few educators object to the idea of the news program itself . Modeled on the Today show and Good Morning America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines , facts and features , along with a focus piece examining one story in depth . The young announcers , who include Kenny Rogers Jr. , son of the country-and-western singer , will even spring pop quizzes on their viewers . Example : Which of these two is older , the pyramids or the Great Wall of China ? ( Answer : the pyramids . ) <P> However , each program will also carry four 30-second ads , causing some educators to worry about the encroachment of commercialism on the classroom . " Do we want our young people to get the idea from school that buying fast food is as important as learning when Columbus discovered America ? " asks Patricia Albjerg Graham , dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education . Adds Bella Rosenberg , an official at the American Federation of Teachers : " By showing commercials , schools are implicitly endorsing the product . " Others charge that principals are selling their students ' souls for a pile of high- tech hardware . Says Peggy Charren , who heads Action for Children 's Television : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of television sets . " <P> Administrators at some pilot schools admit that the lure of free equipment influenced their decisions to air the program . But other officials insist that they chose Channel One primarily on its merits . " Some people assume we 're mindless dolts and victims of rampant commercialism , " says Thomas Sharkey , principal of Billerica Memorial High School in Billerica , Mass . " I consider this the best form of corporate-school partnership . " David Bennett , superintendent of the St. Paul school district , cites lack of public funds as ; a key reason why schools would accept the offer . <P> If the $5 million pilot succeeds , Whittle will open Channel One to schools nationwide . He hopes to have signed up as many as 10,000 schools by 1990 , giving the program an audience of up to 7 million . The estimated cost to Whittle Communications , half of which is owned by Time Inc. , would be $100 million dollars .

Whittle pledges there will be no ads for alcohol , tobacco or contraceptives.
