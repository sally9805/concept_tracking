Ralph Waldo Emerson , upon meeting Mary Ann Evans in 1848 , said she possessed " a calm , serious soul . " Twenty years later a young American visitor to London encountered Mary Ann , now famous as George Eliot . " Behold me literally in love with this great horse-faced blue-stocking , " Henry James wrote to his father . " A mingled sagacity and sweetness  --  a broad hint of a great underlying world of reserve , knowledge , pride and power . " Two years before her death in 1880 , Ivan Turgenev raised his glass at a party in an English country house and proposed a toast to Eliot : " The greatest living novelist ! " <P> Through much of her career , the author of Adam Bede , The Mill on the Floss and Middlemarch commanded great critical and public esteem . But her reputation began to decline with the new century until the epochal year 1933 . It was then that a young American instructor named Gordon Haight came across a cache of Eliot letters in the Yale University Library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correspondence . He became the general editor of the definitive Clarendon Edition of Eliot 's novels and , in 1968 , produced a fine , now standard biography . Haight 's crowning achievement was an edited and annotated edition of her letters . Largely as a result of these efforts , Eliot has re-emerged whole from the Victorian era , as a novelist and as a woman of uncommon fascination . <P> The letters in Haight 's Selections have been judiciously culled from his ninevolume magnum opus . Furnished with explanatory notes , the correspondence may be read as an unselfconscious autobiography recounted in the voice Henry James found as " soft and rich as that of a counselling angel . " Eliot also delights in playing the devil with Victorian cant and hypocrisy . <P> In 1842 , at the age of 22 , the self-taught country girl from Warwickshire writes to her father declaring that she will no longer attend church . Speaking of the Scriptures , she pronounces , " I regard these writings as histories consisting of mingled truth and fiction . " There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the clergymen affronted by her heresy . Even the Rev. Ralph Waldo Emerson is impressed when she informs him that Jean Jacques Rousseau 's Confessions is the first book to " awaken her to deep reflection . " <P> She espouses a variety of radical causes . She denounces slavery in America and anti-Semitism in England , and demands better education for women . After the fall of France 's King Louis Philippe in 1848 , she confides to a friend that she sympathizes with the revolutionaries . To her , Victoria Regina is " our little humbug of a queen , " and she suggests that the world 's monarchs should be put into " a sort of Zoological Garden , where these wornout humbugs may be preserved . " <P> As the unpaid and unacknowledged editor of the celebrated Westminster Review , she enters into fierce arguments about political and religious subjects . Her article " Silly Novels by Lady Novelists " excoriates authors who mistake " vagueness for depth , bombast for eloquence , and affectation for originality . " Even after it becomes known in 1859 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never accused of similar foolishness . For the rest of her life she is regarded as the formidable equal of such eminent Victorians as Charles Dickens and Herbert Spencer .
