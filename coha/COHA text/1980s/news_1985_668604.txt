He ' s the one who photographed Burt Reynolds in the buff for a controversial Cosmopolitan centerfold some 10 years ago , thus triggering a rage for celeb male cheesecake spreads . He ' s the one who made the late Martha Mitchell look like Lana Turner for the cover of New York magazine . And he ' s the one who Farrah Fawcett said " discovered " her when he snapped her for the cover of Cosmo . He ' s acclaimed as one of the great portrait and fashion photographers of our time . He ' s Scavullo . Francesco Scavullo , a small gentle man of 55 , is wearing a pilot ' s cap adorned with a rhinestone airplane pin and an all-black outfit , except for a red knit tie held in place with a crucifix necklace . He is publicizing " Scavullo : Photographs 1948-1984 " ( Harper &; Row , $60 ) , a just-published retrospective of his 35-year career in photographing entertainers , celebrities and the fashionable . " Farrah Fawcett said I discovered her , " Scavullo says proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found me , and Dr. Joyce Brothers said I made her look better than when she was young . " Although his photographs are riveting , exciting , glamorous , sexy and stylish , his personal method seems simple enough . " I make people like me , trust me , " he says . " I charm them . I ' m constantly talking to them , whether they ' re experienced fashion models or performers . We always have music playing to make people less nervous . " Present at all of his photo sessions are a makeup artist , a hairstylist and fashion expert . When Scavullo photographed the late Martha Mitchell , wife of former Atty . Gen. John Mitchell , for instance , he and his staff altered her image from harsh and contrived to young and sultry . On the other hand , when singer Diana Ross finally agreed to have Scavullo do an album cover of her " without the sequins , beads and Bob Mackie dresses , " he convinced her to forget about makeup and the exaggerated hairdo . " She even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and became so attached to them that she wanted to buy them from her , " Scavullo says . The resulting photo showed a barefoot Ross in jeans , a leather jacket and a wet T- shirt . Scavullo had a bit of a problem , though , photographing Muhammad Ali . " I took many rolls of pictures of Mr. Ali , " he says , " but I knew I was getting nothing special from him . Finally I goaded Ali saying , ' Are you No. 1 or No. 2 ? ' He became animated and stuck his fist into the camera , leaving no doubt who he thought was No. 1 . " Other subjects were easy to photograph , and Scavullo became close friends with them . One was the artist Salvador Dali . " I photographed Dali in 1973 , and I was fascinated by him . We got on very well . He ' s a ham . He likes to pose . After our session , he invited me to his every-Sunday-night dinner parties where I met many fascinating people , " Scavullo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and pleasant to photograph . She ' s a photographer , too , and I discussed photography with her . People think after looking at my portrait of them that I made them look alike . But , you know , people say that after you are married to someone for many years , you start to look like them . Perhaps this has happened with Paul and Linda . " One of Scavullo ' s favorite performers and photographic subjects is Liza Minnelli . There are two photographs of Liza in the book , one taken in 1967 and another taken with fashion designer Halston in 1980 . " Liza is great , " Scavullo says . " She is completely comfortable in front of the camera . She performs for the camera . It ' s her friend . She has so much energy . And , of course , I ' ve known Halston since he was a hat designer for Bergdorf Goodman . He ' s a good friend . " Scavullo , who grew up in New York City , has always been interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ' ve had a strong sense of the visual , " he writes in his book ' s introduction . " My earliest memories are visual , and the images I loved were the Chesterfield Girls and my mother ' s magazines : Harper ' s Bazaar and Vogue . It was an enchanting world ; as I leafed through these magazines , I entered a complete world of fantasy . " Eventually he went to work at Vogue as an assistant to the photographer Horst , who at first considered him an " upstart . " Highlights of Scavullo ' s early career include assisting at a photographic session of his idol Marlene Dietrich , shooting a new model who was " exotic and innocent " ( Lauren Bacall ) and his first cover for Seventeen , which landed him his first independent contract . This is Scavullo ' s fourth book . His photographs have been on the covers of every major U.S. magazine and he still claims to be " as excited by photography now as I was when I first saw Garbo on the screen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
