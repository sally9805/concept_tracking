The new Hilton hotel at Walt Disney World Village in Lake Buena Vista , Fla. , has telephones that would fit into Disney 's Tomorrowland . With 35 buttons instead of the standard twelve , the UTX Five Star phones do a lot more than just give a dial tone . As in many hotels , guests can press different buttons on the phone for food , a bell captain , a maid , the valet service or medical aid . But they can also hit other buttons to adjust the temperature setting , change the speed of the fan and switch channels on the TV . If a guest forgets to bolt the door , a red light appears on the phone . Each unit is connected to a smoke detector , and if a fire breaks out , the phone automatically alerts the hotel 's security desk . The staff can then broadcast evacuation instructions to all guests through speakers in the phones . <P> The phones , which are made by United Technologies , occasionally malfunctioned when the hotel opened late last year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary . Within minutes , the director of housekeeping popped in to tell him his conversation was being broadcast to every room on the fifth floor .
