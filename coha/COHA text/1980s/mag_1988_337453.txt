At the beginning of this Brazilian pageant , a colonel surprises his rivals in a violent encounter known thereafter as tocaia grande , the big ambush . It is an overriding metaphor , not only for events in Jorge Amado 's novel but also for those outside it . There the ambushees are bookstores , critics and the public . The firepower comes from an arsenal of hype . <P> Bantam , Amado 's new publisher , seems uncomfortably aware that its author is not a brand name . His 21 previous novels ( among them Gabriela , Clove and Cinnamon and Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands ) have been translated into 46 languages in 60 countries , but in North America he has never been able to break from the shadows of such Latin American celebrities as Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa . Moreover , the portly mestre is 75 and unlikely to produce many more epics . The Amado boom has to be detonated now or not at all . <P> Accordingly , Bantam , which paid the unusually high price of $250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate promotional campaign . It commissioned the " big-book look " : a dust jacket with an original painting , featuring the author 's name in print nearly as big as the title . Last month Amado and his wife were flown to New York City for interviews , receptions , book signings . Now a national advertising campaign is under way , complete with a mailing of 8,000 postcards to bookstore owners . Inscribed on each one is an encomium from Vargas Llosa : " Not only is Jorge Amado one of the greatest writers alive , he 's also one of the most entertaining . " <P> The merchandise Bantam is pushing is a romantic evocation of Brazil 's cacao region circa 1900 , when it was a lawless frontier powerfully reminiscent of the American West . The land surrounding the settlement of Tocaia Grande , as it becomes known , is peopled with archetypes : gunslingers and half-breeds , fortune hunters and wanderers , gypsies and whores . They are placed under the % authority of Captain Natario da Fonseca , a macho gunman with grand appetites for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast has a grand appetite for sex and violence . Surrounding Natario are men like Fadul Abdala , a gigantic Turk who talks to God in Arabic " since he was n't sure that the Almighty knew Portuguese , " and the black Castor , a former serf turned free spirit . Their loosely plotted exploits are augmented by a series of women identified principally by their breasts and buttocks . In the beginning , all is fornication , feasts and braggadocio . But the blessed time grows short , and soon the arena is visited by catastrophe . Flood and plague are followed by lurid murders ; imperialism prevails , and the notion of honor is buried with the men who upheld it . In its ultimate tragedy , the city of Tocaia Grande is ambushed by history . " What happened afterward , " says Amado with bitter irony , " progress , emancipation . . . the church , the bungalows , the villas , the vicar , the prosecutor , and the judge . . . is n't worth mentioning , holds no interest .
