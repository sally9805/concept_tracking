The man on the screen seemed distinctly ill at ease . Puffing on Marlboros , his eyes darting nervously between camera and interviewer , he vowed to launch terrorist attacks against Americans at home and abroad . That was not all ; he labeled Ronald Reagan " enemy No. 1 , " implying that the President of the U.S. is a prime target for assassination . <P> Until last week , Americans had seen Mohammed Abul Abbas Zaidan , better known as Abul Abbas , only in a few still photographs and snippets of TV footage . The accused plotter behind last fall 's hijacking of the Achille Lauro and hence a suspect in the murder of cruise ship Passenger Leon Klinghoffer , Abbas is on most-wanted lists in the U.S. , Italy and Israel . Suddenly , however , the elusive Palestinian showed up on American television last week . In exchange for the exclusive 3 1/2-min. interview , NBC News executives agreed not to disclose Abbas ' whereabouts , an arrangement that stirred up almost as much debate among U.S. officials and journalists as the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to use American television as a platform to air his deadly views . <P> " Obviously , terrorism thrives on this kind of publicity , " said Charles Redman , a State Department spokesman . Robert Oakley , head of the State Department 's counterterrorism office , called NBC 's decision to keep Abbas ' location secret " reprehensible " and accused the network of becoming , in effect , the terrorist 's " accomplice . " <P> There is nothing novel about a news organization acceding to ground rules in pursuit of a story , and that includes pledging not to disclose details of where interviews took place . Most reporters also seem to shy away from any definitive prohibition on interviewing fugitives , even those wanted for murder . " We as journalists do n't see ourselves as an extension of any law- enforcement agency , " says John Seigenthaler , editorial page editor of USA Today . " What the journalist has to consider is whether the information to be gained is so vital that it tips the scale in favor of granting protection to a fugitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Seigenthaler , the Abbas interview did not pass that test . Abbas uttered only predictable propaganda , offering little that was new or surprising . " I did n't see anything that was remarkable or enlightening , " says George Cotliar , managing editor of the Los Angeles Times . Comments Karen Elliott House , foreign editor of the Wall Street Journal : " We are not in the business of spreading propaganda but in the business of analyzing why things happen and what they mean . I do n't see ( the interview ) as a great journalistic coup . "
