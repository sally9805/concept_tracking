In a perverse replay of 1978 , Marchais undercuts Mitterrand <P> It was the biggest Communist Party rally of the French presidential election campaign . Thousands of students and workers marched across Paris to the historic Place de la Bastille . Many carried banners with familiar bread-and-butter Slogans : WE WANT HOUSING AND JOBS and PRODUCE FRENCH . Caravans of buses filled with activists poured in from the provinces . With rope and tackle , a mountain climber managed to hoist a red flag to the summit of the square 's monumental central column , where it fluttered from the arms of a winged figure . Finally the party 's pugnacious leader , Presidential Candidate Georges Marchais , rose to address the cheering throng of 70,000 . <P> Marchais , 60 , an aggressive , hard-lining former metalworker who has been party boss for the past eight years , seized the occasion to launch some characteristically hard-bitten attacks on the leading candidates . French President Valry Giscard d'Estaing , he proclaimed , was " the champion of the insolent and decadent aristocracy that dominates France . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaulted the Bastille " in 1789 , sweeping away " the old rotten regime . " Then he turned with equal antagonism on the other main candidate , Socialist Leader Franois Mitterrand . Heaping scorn on his former partner in the now defunct coalition of leftist parties , Marchais disparaged Mitterrand 's socialist and working-class credentials . " He passes his time soliciting the confidence of the business community , " said Marchais . He went on to urge his troops to turn out in record numbers at the ballot box . By doing so , he clearly implied , they would help prevent the Socialist from winning . <P> Marchais 's speech was characteristic of the perverse , often perplexing performance that has made him the spoiler of the campaign . That role has taken on a bizarre urgency as the two-round election draws close . Polls indicate that in the first round , April 26 , Mitterrand should handily defeat both Marchais and the fourth challenger , Gaullist Leader Jacques Chirac , and run a close second to Giscard . <P> In that event Giscard and Mitterrand would face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Communists could be instrumental in swinging the outcome either way . <P> Marchais bills himself as the " anti-Giscard candidate , " but the non-Communist French press routinely describes his speeches as " doubletalk . " One prominent Socialist leader goes so far as to call him a " Janus , who has two faces : one the anti-Giscard candidate , the other turned against Franois Mitterrand . " Pundits insist that Marchais actually has a carefully masked preference for the re-election of the conservative Giscard over the leftist Mitterrand . His main reason , they reckon : the fear that a Socialist victory would severely undercut the influence of the smaller Communist Party and relegate it to a helpless **33;6524;TOOLONG ambiguity .
