Weep for me , whoever has charity , truth and justice ! I did not come on this voyage for gain , honor or wealth . <P> - Christopher Columbus <P> Most of the children met so far have known what they want out of life , and their desires are connected to the violence around them . The Belfast children long to get away from that violence , even if it means not seeing their country again . The Israelis want peace with victory . The Palestinian children seek redress for wrongs done their people . The Cambodians yearn for tranquillity . Within their various desires , they show great kindliness and generosity and a high sense of fairness . This generally applies to the children of Viet Nam as well . Most of these children seek a little of each of the things sought by the others-escape , honor , victory , peace . They also display the same basic goodheartedness of all children of war . <P> Yet technically they are not children of war-not of war as it is fought in Belfast , Nahariya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are no gun battles or street riots in Viet Nam any more . One side has won , one has lost ; and the children of the losers have the choice of " re-education , " hunger or the sea . The children of Viet Nam have known war , and they have also known the consequences of war . They thus offer an opportunity to pose the one question that has been hovering over all these children , which is a question about the future . <P> So you ask the priest : " Do these experiences-the war , the voyage-do something permanently worthwhile for the children ? Or will the children change as they grow older ? Will they eventually become like any generation of warriors ? " <P> " Who can tell ? " the priest shrugs . " Some of these children have been through hell . It will depend on what their memories do to them . " <P> On this hot , blue Sunday morning , on this pontoon in Hong Kong harbor , on a crate marked PRECISION EXPLOSIONS , LTD. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haiphong with 28 others , who five weeks ago slipped aboard too small a junk and trusted themselves to the South China Sea . Behind him the junk bobs crazily in the harbor , giving an idea of how it must have rolled in open swells . His fellow refugees huddle together on the pontoon , staring straight ahead , as if posing for a formal family photograph , and sipping water from an orange plastic bucket passed from hand to hand . Three women group under a tent made of shirts to keep the sun off . They pay no attention to the gawkers in fresh-painted yachts who swing close by for a look . A woman nurses a baby so small it can be mistaken for her own forearm . <P> Around the pontoon , boats chug and cruise-police boats , water taxis , sampans piloted by women in straw hats , ferries , tugs , dredges , schooners . Freighters with exotic names lie at anchor . In the background , the office buildings of Hong Kong Island stand pressed against Victoria Peak . Trinh Thi Nuong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is told that she looks lovely . <P> <P> At that she becomes selfconscious , and her eyes fill up with tears . She says that she is thinking of her father who was left behind in Viet Nam .
