It is , after all , the last active village of Shakers , a celibate religious group that once had thousands of members living in villages in nine states . When she was in her 40 ' s , Miss Carr was the youngest member here and many of the handful of other members were quite elderly. // Then , about 14 years ago , Arnold Hadd arrived from Massachusetts . He was 21 years old . Eight years ago , Wayne Smith , who was 16 , moved in . And four years ago , Meg Haskell , who was 24 , joined the group . Miss Carr no longer worries . " I have a very good feeling to know that they are here , " said Miss Carr , who was brought to the Shaker village as an orphan . " They ' re a vital part of the community , very committed. " // // ' Few Are Called ' // Many have said the Shakers are a dying breed , doomed by their rule of celibacy . But to the nine people living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue well into the 21st century . And , the members said , the number of residents in the village is not an accurate measure of the work of the religion founded in England more than 200 years ago. // " This life is very demanding and is something that few are called to do , " said Leonard L. Brooks , the director of the Shaker museum and library here but not a Shaker himself . " There are other aspects of how the Shaker church serves God in this world : the number of people who come to Sunday meeting , who correspond with the brothers and sisters , who volunteer their time to help in the village. " // He says a dozen outsiders usually join the Shakers the morning worship services on Sundays in the summer , gathering in the sparsely furnished Meeting House , and about 300 people have joined the Friends of the Sabbathday Lake Shakers , which provides financial support for the village. // When the Shakers wanted to renovate the former school building for use as an archives for Shaker history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , 500 people tour the village each summer to look at the simple Shaker furniture and to see Shaker inventions , including water-repellant cloth. // " People still are amazed and surprised that we are living here , " said Miss Carr . " Most people think Shakerism has died out , but the way of life is still very much alive . " <> <> Simple Lives , With Conveniences // The life is a throwback to another era , when farming was the foundation for the family and simplicity was paramount . A huge garden on a portion of the community ' s 1 , 900 acres here produces nearly all the vegetables that members eat , as well as herbs that are sold in perhaps 100 stores around the nation. // The members grow sheep for yarn , which is also sold commercially , and sell timber from their wood lots . They rent their apple and pear orchard to a local farmer. // " Being a part of the Shaker community did a whole lot more for me than just going to church on Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Church had always been a burden , but being here , God became someone I could be close to. " // Mr. Smith became acquainted with the Shakers while at high school in Cumberland , Me . His high school English teacher , a Shaker , asked for help with some farm animals . He attended Sunday services and visited and two years later asked if he could move in. // His parents , who live in North Yarmouth , Me. , about 30 miles away , were stunned. // " They were concerned and figured I ' d stay for a while and then return to the real world - figured I ' d outgrow it , " he said. // While the Shakers lead simple lives , they do not reject modern conveniences . They have a television , a dishwasher , a Cuisinart food processor and a very old tractor . A station wagon and a pickup truck serve their transportation needs. // Their dwelling house , a six-story brick structure , has an oil furnace , but they prefer to heat with wood , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in just about every room. // They dress uniformly - the women in long dresses in muted colors and the men in collarless shirts and dark trousers - only on Sundays or when they leave the village to represent the community . Some wear blue jeans while working in the garden. // They go to movies and watch " Murder She Wrote , " a television mystery series , and the news until it gets too depressing , said Miss Carr. // The Shakers , whose formal name is the United Society of Believers in Christ ' s Second Appearing , were founded in the mid-1700 ' s by Ann Lee , a daughter of a blacksmith in Manchester , England , after she became attracted to the teachings of the Quakers. // By the time Miss Lee brought a group of eight followers to the United States in 1774 , they were known as the Shakers , because of their motions and dancing in services . <> <> ' It Isn ' t That Difficult ' // Miss Lee believed in celibacy because that was how Christ lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest stumbling block of life in a Shaker community , although it is the element that receives the most attention. // " One of the hardest things is giving up one ' s independence to come and go as you please and giving up your possessions , " said Miss Carr . " I knew if I made the decision to stay that that would be the life . It isn ' t that difficult. " // Many early members were married couples who , once they came to live in the community , lived together as brother and sister . Several years ago a married couple " tried out the life , " as the Shakers say , but decided to leave after a year . A handful of people have come and gone in the past five years , and one young man is now in the yearlong novitiate program. // Mr. Brooks said a declining interest in agriculture , not the celibacy rule , was responsible for the dwindling Shaker population. // Several former Shaker villages are now museums , and the Shaker village in Canterbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer hold worship services . Some museums have displays of the equipment and methods Shakers used to make furniture , but no member continues the tradition. // The Shakers in New Gloucester make window frames , coat hangers and wooden animal figures and occasionally will re-weave the seat bottoms of Shaker-style chairs , which are woven with wool tape. // The Shakers have historically lived in communities apart from society , but they have nevertheless had much contact with outsiders . Miss Haskell is employed outside the village in a surveyor ' s office . Mr. Hadd and Miss Carr have traveled to Washington , D.C. , California and New York for lecture series and regularly give programs in public schools. // In addition , the community prepares a meal each week for the homeless at a shelter in Portland. // " We ' re not just living in an ivory tower apart from the world , " said Miss Carr . " We are in the world , preferably among those less fortunate. " //                @ @ @ @ @
