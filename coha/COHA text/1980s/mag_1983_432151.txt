 |  | First will come the bureaucrats . Then the moving vans and rental trailers . Then the bulldozers ? ripping up houses , concrete foundations , utility poles , a sewage-treatment plant , even the trees . Finally , enormous dump trucks will rumble in and bury Mountain View Mobile Home Estates under 2 feet of dirt . The subdivision , covering 17 acres just outside this remote mining town in east-central Arizona , will cease to exist . Some 100 people will be displaced , and U.S. taxpayers and businesses will be out 4.4 million dollars . Thus , Mountain View Mobile Home Estates will join a rapidly growing list of American communities being forcibly abandoned as the nation begins a massive campaign to clean up the environmental mistakes of industrial society ? the final cost of which is unknown but surely will total in the billions of dollars . The exodus began in 1980 with the evacuation of Love Canal , a neighborhood-in Niagara Falls , N.Y. , poisoned Mountain View residents are moving after a fouryear battle against asbestos contamination from local plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count , some 2,800 persons nationwide had been moved from their homes and businesses at a cost of about 40 million dollars , and the wave of mass removals is building rapidly . All this is being paid for by the 1.6-billion-dollar Superfund created by Congress in the wake of the Love Canal crisis to clean up chemical spills and abandoned toxic dumps . Most of the fund ? 87.5 percent of it ? comes from an excise tax on the production of raw materials that eventually become hazardous wastes . Taxpayers are tapped for the balance . In Missouri , the 2,400 residents of Times Beach in early June agreed to sell their town to the federal government for 33.5 million dollars after scientists found that contamination by the toxic chemical dioxin made it unsafe for human habitation . It is only one of 31 dioxin-contaminated " hot spots " in the state . In New Jersey , Governor Thomas Kean has offered temporary housing to 100 Newark residents living near a downtown plant once used to manufacture Agent Orange , a powerful defoliant used in Vietnam during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a key ingredient of Agent Orange . " Tip of the iceberg . " Officials fear that Mountain View and other communities slated for oblivion are only the beginning . Says John Seyffert , chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's mitigation-assistance division : " How many more of these dumps are sitting out there ? We do n't know , but we 're probably at the tip of the iceberg . " One clue to the extent of the problem : Confidential documents obtained by investigators as part of the congressional probe of the Environmental Protection Agency warn that by the end of this century America will be pockmarked with " dead zones " ? chemically contaminated areas that will be uninhabitable for generations to come . EPA chief William Ruckelshaus told an audience of scientists on June 22 that many communities are " gripped by something approaching panic " about toxic pollutants that expose them to " a mine field of risks . " He urged a stepped-up search by scientists to re- solve the uncertainties about the health effects of toxic substances . The worry at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivision of 45 manufactured homes is being relocated because the dwellings sit on the site of an old asbestos mill . EPA investigators say the fibrous white mineral has contaminated the soil down to 10 feet below the surface and collects in rugs , drapes , ventilation ducts and even wall insulation of the homes . Lungs affected . Researchers have linked asbestos to several illnesses , including mesothelioma , a cancer of the lining of the lungs , and asbestosis , a crippling , emphysemalike disease caused by a buildup of asbestos fibers in the lungs . The problem first surfaced in 1979 when state health officials visited Mountain View to check complaints about an overloaded sewer system and spotted piles of asbestos tailings at the old Metate Asbestos Company mill ? standing in the middle of the homes ? and across a fence at the nearby D. W. Jaquays asbestos mill . Within six months , Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt had declared an emergency and spent nearly $200,000 to move residents out temporarily , demolish the Metate mill building and spread 6 inches of clean topsoil on yards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away most of the new dirt . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta advised Arizona and EPA officials that a major cleanup ? or , better yet , permanent relocation of residents ? should get top priority . Yet nothing happened for more than three years . Witnesses at recent congressional hearings testified that Rita Lavelle , who has since been fired as head of the EPA Superfund , deliberately stalled action on Mountain View Estates . Witnesses said that chemical-industry officials did not want any of the Superfund money they contributed going to clean up a mining-industry problem . Mining-industry lobbyists , in turn , were said to oppose action for fear they would be billed for the cleanup . One EPA official has described Mountain View Estates as " a major agency embarrassment . " While waiting for Washington to act , residents of the subdivision filed lawsuits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from federal , state , county and city governments as well as from Jack Neal , who developed Mountain View Estates on the property of his Metate Asbestos Company . Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mountain View Estates has divided this once close-knit town of 8,000 that has survived for more than a century by mining the desert for silver , copper and asbestos . Some Globe citizens scoff at Mountain View Estates residents who fear for their health . The government buyout plan , declares Tom Anderson , publisher of the weekly Arizona Silver Belt , " is a big federal boondoggle ? a waste of taxpayers ' money . " Many townsfolk who do not live at Mountain View Estates contend that the type of asbestos found in the region ? chrysotile asbestos ? has not killed or harmed a single person in the more than 50 years it has been mined and milled in and around Globe . Publisher Anderson notes that large parts of the town , including City Hall and his newspaper plant , are built on old asbestos mine and mill sites . " You can make just as good a case for picking up all 8,000 of us and moving us as you can for moving the folks out of Mountain View , " he argues . Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. W. Jaquays Mining &; Equipment Compa- ny . He recalls that as many as 13 asbestos mills were working in the Globe area in the mid-1950s , when the federal government was buying the fiber for its defense stockpiles . " There were times the white rnill dust was so thick drivers on Highway 60 could n't see to drive and we would shut down for a few hours to let it settle , " Gerhardt says . " If this type of asbestos is so carcinogenic , why does Gila County have a lower incidence of cancer than both the Arizona and national averages , even after half a century of exposure ? " Yet Dr. Jaynes Sarn , outgoing director of the Arizona Department of Health Services , agrees with most other health experts that all asbestos is dangerous . " The preponderance of studies shows that chrysotile asbestos is definitely dangerous , " he reports . Mountain View Estates is located 2 miles east of the center of town , sandwiched between Highway 70 and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks . The subdivision opened in 1973 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Neal 's mill . There is a shortage of buildable land amid Globe 's steep hills and deep valleys , so Neal decided to divide the mill site into lots and sell them at prices ranging from $5,500 to $7,500 . Among the buyers was John Insalaco , who with his brother owns a music store and upholstery shop in town . John and his wife Elaine are New Yorkers who moved to Globe more than 10 years ago . They were followed by John 's brother , their parents and an uncle . Elaine 's parents also moved to Globe , and all of them live in Mountain View Estates . Insalaco explains why he and his family could not just hook up and move away once the asbestos hazard became known , although he lives in what is called a mobile-home park . " This is a subdivision , not a trailer park , " he says . " These are manufactured homes that move only once . " Harassment in town . While waiting to move , residents of Mountain View Estates have had to endure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in town is tremendous , " says Insalaco . Adds Maury Gooch , a disabled retiree who has lived in Mountain View Estates with his wife Dorothy since 1976 : " Some of the townsfolk laugh at us ; some old friends turn their backs on you . They say we 're making it up , but they do n't come out here to see you any more . They say we are after a fast buck , but they do n't know what it is like to learn that the home you love is contaminated , poisonous . " In response to claims that no health problem exists , Insalaco says : " I know all the arguments about how safe chrysotile asbestos is . One night at a city-council meeting , I sat behind two guys fighting the cleanup and listened to them talking . They get out about one sentence , and then they stop and wheeze like they just ran up stairs . Huff and puff . The stuff they are defending is getting them , too . " For citizens of Globe , the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erase it from the face of the earth ends years of controversy . As Mayor G. H. " Hank " Williams says : " The mood is , Let 's get this over and done with so we can get back to living quietly . ' " For countless residents of other U.S. communities ? many of them as yet unidentified ? the trauma of mass flight from poisonous contamination still lies ahead .
