three cows for each of the boys , and six for the girl , as the Law says girls require more care . And everything without my name 's being mentioned  --  can you do that , lad ? " Padriac 's eyes glowed with pride . " That I can , my lord ! " he assured Brian . " Very well then , it is agreed . I 've already paid the cart driver enough to send him back to the Slieve Aughty mountainsa happy man ; he will tell no one that I rescued Norse babies . Nor will you . " " But my lord , such an act of kindness does you credit . " Brian 's face was momentarily contorted by a huge , crackjawyawn . " Padraic , " he said when it was satisfyingly concluded , " I make hard decisions and I lead men to their deaths in battle . To follow me without question they need to believe that the iron in me goes straight through , that I am invulnerable , immune to human weakness  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of their own desires , and it was not their desire to save the Northman 's spawn from Limerick . " They went forward in a companionable silence , the spear carrier walking proudly at the horse 's shoulder , Brian sitting as straight as always . After some distance he spoke once more , so low that the youth had to press against his knee in order to hear him . " Of course , " he murmured , not looking at Padraic but keeping his eyes fixed on the road ahead , " there might come a time when I would have no objection to your telling about this . Do you understand ? " Padraic , who did not , smiled and nodded . The people of Munster met their returning heroes with showers of blossoms and thrown kisses . It seemed that thep251news of every detail of the battle at Sulcoit had been carried to Cashel by runners , and amply embroidered en route . The king had fought like an emperor , the people were telling one another , and his brother like an avenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road from the causeway of the Suir crowds met them , singing . Old women called blessings upon them and children ran forward , giggling and daring one another to snatch hairs from the tails of the officers ' horses . Brian 's mount , who had had enough of warfarefor a while , laid back his ears and kicked petulantly whenever anyone came too close to his hindquarters , and so was able to make his way in relative peace . Brian 's thoughts ran ahead to Deirdre , waiting somewhere within the stone walls of the hallowed fortress . Deirdre . She moved before his eyes in a hundred remembered poses . Lovely and shy as a wood violet , her delicacy like a breath of air from some hidden waterfall amid cool ferns . A luminous princess from his boyhood 's tales of champions and their maidens . And then he saw her with the cloud in her eyes , and the barely perceptible shuddering that marked the onset of an attack . He remembered her in a blue-lit chamber on a rainy day , her robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head drooping , her black curls without luster , the low mournful sound of her helpless weeping going on and on . He saw her kneeling on the bed , the depression replaced by hysteria , her face engorged with rage , her mouth stretched into an ugly square as she screamed at him . If only there were someplace else to go ; some way to alter the direction of time so that he would be back on the plain at Sulcoit , with the chanting at his back and his destiny coming to him in one transcendent hour ! His horse , eager for its pen and fodder , lengthened its stride so that Padraic was forced to run to keep up . Faces beaming with happy smiles lined the roadway on both sides , and joyous voices called out to him . " Welcome , Prince Brian ! " " There he is , the hero of Sulcoit . Wave to him now ! "  | " Brian Boru ! " someone shouted . " Boru ! Born ! " And the glow returned for a golden moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates of Cashel swung open . Brian entered with his captains and the chieftains of Munster who had won their own glory at Sulcoit , and as he looked up he saw that the banner of the three lions hung equally with , not below , the king 's banner at the portal . Fithir met them with outstretched hands and a ready explanation for Mahon 's obvious absence . " The king hastened home as soon as the battle ended , " she said smoothly , " so that he might begin the prayers of thanksgiving immediately . He is in the chapel with his brother Marcan at this very moment . He will be so glad to hear you have arrived safely ! " Brian searched her face for some clue . Her expression was so carefully bland it was obvious she was hiding something , and he felt the finger of dread trace down his spine . He made himself ask : " Deirdre ? " Fithir 's face relaxed into a radiant smile . " Oh , my lord , God has been good to us indeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since that time her mind has been as clear as a young girl 's ! " Brian stared at her . " Are you certain ? " " The physician says that childbirth has calmed her almost miraculously . Whereas sometimes it brings a deep melancholy on a woman , in her case it appears to have worked a sort of cure . She is still nervous , you understand , and shy as a coney , but she seems more like herself than she has in months . When you are cleaned and rested , I will take you to see her . " " And what of the king ? " Brian asked , feeling a drumbeat starting deep within him . A son ... a son .. . The skin of Fithir 's face tightened on its bones and she hesitated . That was it , then . Brian took a half step toward her , to encourage her with his size and proximity , and to his astonishmentshe melted bonelessly into his arms and began crying . " Oh , Brian , he has seen no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last hour , when he sent for the barber ! "  | " The barber ? " Brian asked , baffled . Fithir 's sobs redoubled . " He asked to have his hair cut in a tonsure ! Like a monk ! " she wailed . Mahon had returned to Cashel sick at heart . Refusing to see anyone or discuss the battle , he went directly to his privatechamber and barred the door . A crowd of courtiers piled up in his wake , each clamoring for an audience , but the door remained resolutely shut . Marcan , who had been waiting at Cashel to discuss his possible appointment to the hierarchy of the Church with his brother the king , at last succeeded in talking his way past the guard and knocked on Mahon 's door , calling his name in a loud voice . He was granted a grudging admission . Mahon sat in a lampless darkness , his chin sunk upon his chest ; he did not look at his priestly brother . " What do you want ? " he asked Marcan in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy , " Marcan replied smoothly , realizing that the king was in no frame of mind to discuss bishopricsand abbacies . " Whatever burden you bear , dear brother , I assure you that God will lift it from your shoulders if you will only ask Him . " Mahon groaned . " I have looked into Hell ! I have seen the ultimate ugliness of men 's souls . I watched while our own tribesmen turned into beasts like the Northmen .. . and the responsibility was mine ; they murdered babies in my name ! " " Christ look down upon us ! " Marcan breathed . He hurried across the room and flung himself on his knees beside his brother . " My lord king , my dear brother , God in His wisdom has surely sent me to you in this moment of your distress . Lean on me and let me help you , and together we will ask God to bring you peace , and comfort for your over-burdened soul . " Marcan 's features arranged themselves into a beatific smile . After several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summon the king 's confessor . To him Marcanp254related in triumphant voice , " I have been blessed by God ! I am being allowed to bring the wandering soul of the king to the ultimate realization of God 's plan . He will give up the love of luxury and the sinful trappings of temporal power and be God 's man from henceforth , like the great priest-kings of old . Come with us to the chapel , that we may pray . " The three men knelt together on the stone floor . Following Marcan 's instructions , Mahon extended his arms in the Sign of the Cross and held them outstretched , hour after hour , untilthe agony of his muscles erased the sight of Limerick from his tortured mind . The blaze of religious fervor that had long ago consumed Marcan leaped from him to his brother , and Mahon welcomed it , welcomed its flames that were brighter than his nightmare vision of the dying Norse city . He prostrated himself before the altar and poured out his bitterness and his horror to One who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited to wash himself with the ritual warmed and scented water offered to every guest and resident of Cashel , but had hurried directly to Deirdre 's bedside to see her condition for himself , and feast his eyes on their first-born son . The baby was lusty and red-faced , with an undeniably healthy set of lungs . Deirdre looked pale and shrunken beneath the covers , but her clear gaze was lucid and she smiled brightly at him when Brian entered the room . She lifted one thin white hand , and he pressed it gratefully to his lips . " My lord , " she acknowledged softly . At first he was as careful with her as one is in the presence of an old wound , but when her eyes remained dry and her voice cheerful he began to hope that perhaps the baby had , after all , worked a small miracle . " There will be a celebration in the banqueting hall tonight , " he told Deirdre , " and I would like to present my -- our  --  son formally to the court . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish I were strong enough to be there with you , " she told him . But Deirdre was not the only member of the king 's family to be absent from the festive occasion . Mahon 's High Seat was empty and Fithir entered the hall alone . When her eyes met Brian 's she shook her head . " The king is still at his prayers , " she told everyone firmly , " and has asked not to be disturbed . " The hall buzzed with whispers and speculation . Before the first red wine was poured a maidservant entered with the infant in her arms , and carefully unfolded the fine linen sheet in which he was wrapped so that everyone could see he was a healthy male . Beaming with pride , Brian lifted the boy above his head . " My son ! " he shouted down the hall . " Murrough mac Brian , prince of the Dal Gais ! " " Murrough mac Brian ! " they thundered back to him amid cheers and blessings . Murrough drew a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly requested the attendance of those men still living who were survivors with him of the outlaw days in Thomond . Now they entered the hall one by one , cleaned and freshly dressed but with the scars of their most recent battle still on them , and Brian gave to each a special token , some treasure of exceeding value liberatedfrom the Norse city . As they came and knelt before him , the herald read their names and Aed made a brief poem , reciting each man 's history and special accomplishments . Liam mac Aengus , who had been their physician when they had no other . Leti of the Long Knife , his face permanentlyscarred into a grin that Brian found beautiful , because he knew its price . Klan and Brendan and Illan Finn . The brothers Loaghaire and Reardon Bent-Knee . Fergus the Fist and Conaing the Beautiful Chief . But no Nessa . Nor Ardan . There were two piles of treasure in their names , the finest of all , scrupulously set aside on a tableapart from the others . And their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p256The  torches burned late in the hall , and the cheering and singing could be heard clearly in the chapel where Mahon knelt . " You are a born killer and you will go on killing , " Mahon accused , not looking at his youngest brother . Brian had finally forced a confrontation by invading the king 's private chamber , and now they stood , separated by more than space , in a room Brian scarcely recognized . It had been stripped bare of its luxurious appointments . The hangings were gone from the cold walls , the floors were bare of rushes , even the wealth of lamps had been replaced by one feeble stub of a candle . The chamber now held only a thin pallet and a chest , and one black crucifix hung on the wall . It was the cell of an ascetic . " What have you done with your things ? " Brian asked , ignoringhis brother 's accusation . " I do n't understand . . . " He waved his hand at the stripped room . " No , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you understandis warfare . Brutality . Lust for power . You do n't realize that material objects are of no consequence compared to the wealth of the spiritual life . I 've been praying to Our Lord to enlighten you as He has me , but so far my prayers are un-answered . " Brian scowled . " You do n't need to pray for my soul , brother . " Mahon gave him a look of curiously commingled disgust and pity . " Ah , but I do , I must ! You and I both have so many guilts to expiate ; you surely earned God 's wrath for the evil you unleashed at Limerick , and I ... " " Is that what this is all about ? You 're trying to punish yourselffor what happened at Limerick ? " " I could never punish myself sufficiently for what happened at Limerick ! I can only try , and beg God 's forgiveness . I misunderstoodthe nature of war . I let myself be seduced by the trappings and the excitement , I let my vanity blind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all now , and I must atone. "  | " Atone ! " Brian snorted . " What have you got to atone for ? Ivar and his allies are nursing their wounds on some sandy islandinfested with black flies , where the Fergus joins the Shannon . Irish families that have quarreled with one another for years are united now , proud of being Munstermen together , singing your praises and speaking of the possibility of freeing all our land from the tyranny of the foreigners . By God , that 's an accomplishment to be proud of , and yet you sit here beating your breast and crying mea culpa . I tell you frankly , brother , I would n't want a conscience like yours ; there is no logic in it . " Mahon looked at him bleakly . " And I no longer want a soul like yours , barbarous and cruel . You are the wolf who devours the lambs to fill his own belly . Marcan has convinced me that we must walk in the paths of peace , accepting God 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marcan is a priest , with his own view of God 's will , and I do n't happen to think that view is right for our situation . I 'm not even convinced that it is God 's will that we be victims , though Marcan used to expend a lot of energy trying to convince me of it . He could not persuademe and so he has gone to work on you , and I am sure he is very proud of his ... his accomplishment . " The deep voice was bitingly sarcastic . " Marcan has brought me peace , Brian ; he has shown me that there are other paths that I may follow . God sent him to me when I needed him most . " " God did n't send him ! Marcan came here himself to beg your influence in having him named bishop of Killaloe . Marcanmay preach humility , but he hungers for power within the Church as much as any tribal king hungers to expand his holdings . " " I will war no more , Brian , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much pain . I sent your own brothers into battle ill-prepared , I think , and knew the guilt of seeing them die for a kingship I did not really value , even then . I tried to do betterby you , and yet when I see what you have become I think I would rather have buried you somewhere in Tipperary , withp258Lachtna and Niall . I will build a new church on this Rock and give my life to God . " ' You think that is the best way for you to serve God ? Charlemagne built churches , too , but he had a sword in his hand and it was with that sword that he brought Christianity to the Franks . " " I renounce the sword forever ! " Mahon cried . Sensitive to something in his tone , Brian studied the king 's face intently . At last he said , " It is not God 's wrath that frightensyou , brother . I think you are afraid of something in yourself . You enjoyed the killing , if only for a moment  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps . " Marcan is a shrewd dog , and he found that chink in your armor , did n't he ? And worked on it ? " Mahon 's body had stiffened into a column of outrage , but his eyes were haunted . " You 've made a pact with the forces of evil , Brian , " he whispered into the stillness of the room . " You can see into men 's hearts and uncover things better left hidden . " Brian 's smile was small and bitter . " I made no unholy pact , Mahon . I 've merely learned to examine myself in the long watches of the night , and I never lie to myself about what I find . Knowing my own truth makes it easier for me to recognizecertain signs in others . There are similarities in all of us , if we admit to them . With part of my mind I can understand even the Northman 's joy in destruction , and with another part of my mind I can share a child 's innocent pleasures or know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more and more horrified by the brutality you see , and I suppose that does you credit . But you are afraid that it has stained your soul with some permanentmark that wo n't wash off , and you have become desperatefor forgiveness of one of the very qualities God gave you in the first place . " If you would have peace , genuine peace , you must accept all the aspects of your personality and learn to be comfortable with them . You ca n't cut away one part of your nature as a physician cuts away rotten flesh.  | " You must continue to be strong and valiant , because if you wo n't fight to protect what you have won , every Dane and Norseman , every greedy scoundrel and born thief , will come a-gallop to Munster to pick its bones . If you care about these people , Mahon , be a strong king and defend them ! " Mahon slumped against the carved olivewood chest , cradlinghis head in his hands and swaying gently from side to side . " I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can not take men into battle anymore . " A vast pity swept Brian . This is what I wanted , he told himself , only not this way . Not this way . He carefully kept both pity and sympathy out of his voice as he told his brother , " Then I will do it for you . Be the king , hold court , and commune with God , and leave the rest to me . " On the first night of the new moon , Deirdre returned to his chamber from the ladies ' wing . " The physician says I am well , my lord , and able to resume my duties as your wife . " " You want to ? " She dropped her eyelids , the long lashes sweeping in a curve over her cheeks , then looked up again and smiled . " I want to please you , Brian . I know that I have not ... always ... " " You were ill . " He hastened to excuse her . " I suppose so . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , my lord ! " She knew the shadows were still there , waiting in the corners . But since Murrough 's birth she had begun to find she need not look at them . With each passing day she felt more insulated , less vulnerable to them , wrapped securely in some mystical cocoon she shared with her baby . Mothers were special , and strong ; in their presence the shadows lost their power , and she was a mother now . She turned her back on the shadows and saw instead the beauty of her husband . She remembered the songs the harper had sung of him , and imagined how glorious he must have been at Sulcoit . The lips framed by his crisply waving beard were soft , cool , and breathsweet . But when they parted hisp260mouth was hot and hungry , clamping on hers with a passion too long contained . She could not respond in kind ; it took all her new strength to push the fear below the surface and hold it there . But she gave what she could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath him , fighting her desire to resist , wondering at the alien power of the emotion that gripped him and curiously flattered by it . This thing Brian called lovemaking had an intensity she had experienced only through the medium of terror , and when she felt him plunge deeply into her with the last , spendingthrust , and the cry of pleasure was wrung from him , she envied him . That which was forever dreadful to her gave Brian a rewardshe could not even begin to imagine . She put her hand against the back of his head and pressed his face into the hollow of her shoulder , so that he could not see the glitter of tears in her eyes . His heart hammered against her , his breath singed her skin . But he was hers . The worst moment was over , endured , survived ; now she was free to love him . Her fingers twined themselves gently in his hair . " Welcome home , my lord , " she whispered softly . In the dark and desolate cave beneath the roots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends of the earth , weaving the fates of men , the threads that controlled the life of Olaf Cuaran had become exceedingly tangled . Even in distant Dublin he felt them twisting about him , pressingthe air from his lungs , and he grew irritable and morose . Everything seemed to be turning to ashes in his hands ; thep261very foundations of his belief in himself were crumbling beneath his feet . He spoke of it to his old viking comrade Magnus Ulricsson , whose warship Windwalker- had just brought news of the latest setbacks in Northumbria . On Mother Night , the longest night of the year and parent to all other nights , they sat together over their drinking horns , and Olaf 's thoughts were blacker than the starred darkness beyond the walls . " It is n't just the news from the Saxon lands , Magnus , " he said , staring gloomily at his clenched fists on the table . " The Saxons have always fought our efforts to control that land , and I suppose it is inevitable that they challenge our dominancefrom time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge , Olaf We are suffering severelosses and we may even lose control of York city ; then we would have no port on the Humber . " York , once a glittering prize that Olaf had claimed as part of his far-flung kingdom , seemed that night to be a great distanceaway , and only a symptom of the disease that was gnawing his vitals . The possible loss of his holdings to the east was a fitting part of the dark tapestry his life had become . " We are losing more than the Saxon territories , my friend , " he told Magnus . " The very gods have deserted us , and we suffer defeat after defeat at the hands of Celtic upstarts who would not have dared face us in battle a generation ago . My own wife laughs at me . " His broad shoulders slumped and his head sank forward in despair . Magnus snorted derisively . " Your wife ! What does that matter ? She 's only Irish . Have someone run her through with a sword , that will teach her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better one . " " It is n't that easy . For one thing , she is the sister of Maelmordha , prince of Leinster , and I would not have his hand raised against me . Already I am threatened by Munster and Meath , and the Ulstermen are howling like wolves at my door . " " Munster , you say ? You need fear nothing from them  --  they spend all their time fighting amongst themselves . Theyp262are even worse about it than the rest of the Irish . Besides , Ivar of Limerick will keep them too occupied to come adventuringin your territory . " Olaf sighed heavily . " You have been away , Magnus , living a good life in the Saxon lands where things are simple . On this cursed island nothing is as it seems ; friends become foes overnight and there is magic in the very rocks . Bad magic . " Magnus swung round on his bench to stare at his friend . " What 's this you 're saying ? I do not recognize such words , coming from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuaran ! This is late night talk when the drinking horn has been filled too many times . " " No , I only wish it were . But I speak the truth , Magnus . Ever since I wed Gormlaith  --  perhaps even before that  --  there have been signs , portents that I should have been quicker to recognize . This is the land of the Christians , not of O1din and Thor and Freya . We can not hold it in their names and if we continue to try we are doomed . We go into battle against the Cross and we are cut to pieces . " Magnus was becoming alarmed . " Your wits are addled ! You have a few unimportant setbacks and believe their one god is more powerful than all of ours . But just stop and think , man , how many times we have made the Celt flee in terror or grovel in the mud . Why , we hold all this island in one clenched fist ! " " No more , no more , " Olaf said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You spoke of Ivar of limerick  --  he is limerick no longer . Six months ago , Mahon of Munster destroyed Ivar 's army and sacked the city . It is ashes and rubble , and Ivar has fled to Scattery Island , where he is trying to rebuild his forces . I was no friend of Ivar 's , as you know ; ours is an old rivalry , but his loss is mine too in this case . Munster is now united under the Dal Cais , and I fear they will join with Malachi of Meath , who has shown sympathy with their cause , and all march on Dublin . " " Irish kings standing together ? I do n't believe it ! " " Neither did I , but it is true . There is a new feeling in thep263land , spreading outward from Cashel , and we are beginning to hear rumors of a plan to drive Norse and Dane alike from Ireland . " " Talk ! Boastful Irish talk and nothing else . You know how they love to brag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , but they can fight , Magnus . Like you , I underrated them , but no longer . " " And where did they get this prowess on the battlefield ? From the Munster king  --  what 's his name ?  --  Mahon ? " " I suppose so . In his youth he was an indifferent warrior ; he nipped at Ivar 's heels for years without ever being a real threat . Now all of that is changed . In one battle after another , the men of Munster have met and crushed good Northmen ; this very day I heard that Ivar may be forced to flee to Wales , where Donovan of Hy Carbery has some allies who have offeredhim support . " " I think I need more ale , " Magnus commented . " I 've tried ale and I 've tried women ; I 've had the Runes read and made sacrifices to every god , but nothing helps . Day by day , fortune slips away from me and I am powerless to prevent it . I 've come to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you first because you 've been my friend since we first fed our swords wound-dew together . I 've decided to becomea Christian . " Magnus sat bolt upright . " You 've what ! I ca n't believe my ears , the sea wind must have finally destroyed them ! " " You heard me . We are too far from the old gods ; they have no power to help us here . I have long suspected it and now I am certain . I will convert to the White Christ and ask his protection instead , for he is young and vigorous in this land and his priests say he is a god of compassion . I need compassion . I 'm an old man with a young wife and enemies on every side . There is more for me in Christ 's religion than in Odin 's . " " That young wife of yours , is it her hand I recognize in this ? " Olaf laughed without humor . " Gormlaith has no interest in converting new disciples to the Christ ; she is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Magnus , that woman is not the least of my problems ! " When I first became aware of the threat from Meath , she was plaguing me at the time for something to occupy her mind . Almost in jest I asked her to learn something of Malachiand suggest a way to handle him  --  after all , she knows the Irish disposition . To my surprise , she set about it as if the whole thing were a serious military campaign ! In a most unwomanlyway she organized a system of spies and acquired a complete history of the man . She came to me and described his character for me as fully as if they had been raised in the same crib . " " She must be an extraordinary woman . " Olaf 's expression became even more despondent . " She is that . Extraordinary . She has no talent at all for woman 's business , and no interest in it ; she must be forever pushing her oar in where it is not wanted , and her deepest desire seems to be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping her occupied she would have every man in Dublin at his neighbor'sthroat by this time tomorrow . " " And yet it is said of her that she is the fairest woman in Ireland , " Magnus remarked , hoping to bring some ray . of light to his downcast host , and curious to see for himself the Irish princess with a man 's mind and a body like no other woman 's . " There is a song sung of her in the streets ; it is said that she is best gifted in everything that is not in her own power , and does all things ill over which she has any power . " Olaf expelled a long , quivering sigh . " Aye , that 's Gormlaith . " " Then why do you not do as I suggested and get rid of her ? Surely her brother 's goodwill is not that important to you  --  a mere Irishman , after all ! " " If I were a younger , stronger man , I would . I have several good sons by women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of taking my place when I am gone . But Gormlaith has also borne me a son , Sitric , a strapping big boy who reminds me more of myself than any of the others . When he is a man grown I will be proud to own him . If I throw out the mother and keep the son I know she will bringp265her brother down on me , and if you have contempt for the anger of the Irish , I do not . Not anymore . I want to make no more enemies among them . I am already spread too thin , Magnus , I can not afford that . " " You are in a trap , then , old Ravenfeeder . " " I know it . " Magnus swirled his drinking horn in his hand , staring down into the dark brown liquid . " Perhaps there is a way out , for a patient man , " he said at last . " The Irish can not go for long without losing their tempers with one another , as you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all sleep comfortably in the same bed . If you only maintain things as they are and wait , they will fall to quarreling among themselves as they always have and can easily be destroyed . " You can even work behind the bush to help them . Incite them against one another . Remind them of old grievances and start new feuds . They are an easy people to goad . " " That would not be a Christian thing to do , " Olaf said , but there was a light in his eyes . " Do you intend to adopt this Christianity all the way through , or only on the surface ? " " As deep as it needs to go , I suppose . " " Then take my advice and keep your viking heart , my friend . If it gives you comfort to embrace the White Christ do so , but do not think that means you must abandon Ireland to the Celts . Give them enough time and the Irish will destroy their own strength . " " But how much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning , Magnus arose early . Olaf 's unease had communicated itself to him in some fashion , and he had spent a bad night , fragmented by dreams that were too close to wakefulness . At cockcrow his head ached and his mouth tasted like dead fish . There was nothing to be done for it but get up and begin the day . He stepped over the sleeping bodies of Olaf 's men and made his way out of the hall . The pallid sky was pregnant with snow . He stood with his back to the Norse palace ,  |p266stretching  , forcing the cold air into his lungs where it cut like new knives . " Magnus Ulricsson , " said a voice behind him . A throaty , rich voice ; a voice the color of dark amber . " Are you trying to escape without ever having greeted your king 's wife ? " He turned . Magnus thought himself a tall man , but the princess of Leinster was taller . Big-boned in the way of the Irish peasant class , she had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white swan 's , broad and full , and no man could look at it without wanting to bury his face between those magnificent breasts . Firm-waisted , she was broad of hip and long of leg , and when she walked she undulated in a subtlemimickry of the way a woman thrust her pelvis against a man in the act of love . He did not notice what she wore . Gormlaith 's skin was rich cream , glowing and flawless . Her large mouth was red-lipped , quivering , the full underlip moistly inviting . Green eyes , the green of Ireland itself , blazing , emerald , fiery with unquenchable life . And crowning it all , her hair . Her hair such as no other woman on earth possessed . A flame of dark red so pure in color that it had bluish lights , it was plaited and crossed atop her head to form an incomparable crown , then hung in great loops and swags of braid to her hips . She advanced toward him , insolent in her power , smiling and holding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other woman would have , and he steeled himself to avoid stepping back . The natural fragrance of her flesh was that of ripe apricots in the sun ; beneath it lay a faint , more disturbingscent  --  the musk of an animal in heat . " My husband never introduces me to his guests , " she said , although her eyes were saying other things . " At least , not to the big , strong ones . He tells me about them after they 've gone . " She took a deep breath and slowly shifted her weight from one hip to the other . Magnus seemed to have acquired an obstruction in hisp267throat . He spoke around it with difficulty . " Your husband is a prudent man , my lady ! " Her eyes glittered with amusement . " He has learned to be one . Olaf is old and worn , not the man he once was . Tell me , Magnus Ulricsson  --  are you the man you were in your youth ? " Challenge was implicit in every line of her body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing too close to a fire that would strip his flesh from his bones . He tried to move away unobtrusively . But she noticed , and her eyes danced . " I suppose not , " she said , answering her own question . " I am a student of men , Magnus ; did my husband tell you that ? I collect them , as other women collect jewels or robes . But they must be the strongest and best . Why do you suppose is the strongest man in Ireland today ? " " Your husband , the Iron Shoe . Olaf Cuaran , " he answered loyally . " You lie , " she laughed at him . " I do n't mind that  --  I tell lies myself . But surely you know that he has little strength left ; his power is peeling away from him like the layers of a boiled onion . Forget Olaf , I will give you the answer . " The superior man is Malachi of Meath , he who already calls himself Malachi Mor  --  Malachi the Great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Stone of Fal will cry aloud for him . Ireland will have a High King such as she has not known for generations . The five provinces will kneel in submission before him ! " " How can you be certain of that ? " She shifted her weight again , closing the space between them . Though the day was cold a dew of sweat had begun to form on Magnus 's upper lip . " I have made it my business to know a great deal about Malachi Mor , " he told him . " He is the obvious successor to the kingship of Tara ; he is of the southern branch of the Hy Neill , and the Ard Ri has always been of the Hy Neill . Donall is northern Hy Neill , so by the tradition of alternate kingship it will go next to the south . Malachi is young and aggressive , hungry to make a name for himself to rival that of his famousp268ancestor , the first Malachi Mor . There is no other man in the land with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of Munster , Mahon the Dalcassian ? Is n't he coming to be something of a force among the Irish ? " Gormlaith lifted her silky eyebrows . " He is not Hy Neill ! It is unthinkable that a usurper from a minor tribe should be crowned Ard Ri at Tara . No , it will be Malachi , and my poor husband is already shivering in his sleep for fear of him . " It was hard for Magnus to imagine that any man could so unnerve Olaf Cuaran , the conqueror of Northumbria , victor of a hundred savage battles . " You misjudge Olaf , woman , " he said sternly , determined to put an end to her aggression before it became too threatening . " He is a magnificent warrior , he has made of these Irish a subservient race , and he will not lie trembling in his bed this night or any other , just because one of them rises against him . " She tossed her head . Her smile was no longer hot and full of promises . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a man to be broken , like any other man , " she said . " I could break you , Magnus Ulricsson , if I thought you were worth the effort . But you are a little man , a weak man , an old man like my husband . The sap has dried in you . It would be more interesting to match myself against , say , this Malachi Mor . " She turned her shoulder to him then and looked away . " A storm is coming , " she said in a voice grown cool with disinterest . " Can you smell it ? I love storms . " Then she whirled away and was gone , and where she had been there was a cold emptiness.  |p271A  long season of peace came to Munster . A landman could plant his crop , harvest it , let the land lie fallow , and then plant again , and still it was not watered with the blood of his children . The Northmen skulked along the coast and pieced together the shattered fragments of their strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army marched out behind the king 's brother , and death came with it . The Norse bided their time , licking their wounds . To the east , Malachi was enjoying similar successes , and the fellowship he had once felt toward the Irish in Munster began to fade in the light of his own ambition . He called back those of his troops who had stood with Mahon and employed them in continuing campaigns against the foreigners in his own kingdom and the Leinstermen to the south . The monument that was Cashel brooded beneath wintry skies and glowed in the summer sun . Marcan was often there , closing the gap between his elder brother and his God , encouraging Mahan in the religious fervorthat grew within him . From dawn to dark prayers arose from the precincts of Cashel , punctuated occasionally by the cries of an infant as Brian 's children were born . Conor followed Murrough with but a year between them , and then Sabia , a lovely miniature of her mother , and next the dimpled daughter they named Emer , for Cuchullain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the policies of Munster were the policies of Brian of Boruma , few knew that but Brian and the king . With each passing year Mahon found it simpler to give Brian the decisionsto make , the responsibilities to carry , and Brian accepted them all without hesitation . To him , Mahon hadp272ceased being the king ; he was God 's man now  --  and , sometimes , Fithir 's , although his marriage had not rekindled his interestin things of the flesh as much as that lady might have desired . Apart from all of them , from Mahon and Deirdre and even his children , Brian lived alone within himself . And waited , as the Northmen waited . Something was coming alive in his mind . Sometimes he could catch a glimpse of it , a glimmering of an outline , a fragment of a perimeter , and he knew with deep certainty that the time would come when it would all be there , intact and perfect . It need not be rushed . It grew quietlyin the dark , nourished by his experiences and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as a presence . The green land , the passionate , intensely alive people , the great weight of their history together that stretched back through memory to myth , to some prehistoric dawn he could not even imagine . Ireland . A need to love which could not be fearlessly bestowed on any mortal being could be satisfied by the country herself . She could not die . If a man could weave himself into her very fabric she would be his forever , capable of absorbing all his passion , his to safeguard and cherish . Ireland . The beautiful , ravaged , troubled land . The sum of the parts of all her people . More than that . The shape in his mind began to firm . He could grasp its dimensions , and the size of it astonished him but did not frighten him . Once he had thought all his being consecrated to the destruction of the Northmen , but now he could see that was only a part of the overall task . The foreigners were but an obstacle to be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and he played around with them , rearranging them in his head , waiting to see where they would lead . The road ... to empire . It was there , finished and dazzling , in the center of his soul . The Empire of the Irish , as Charlemagne had built the Em/pire of the Franks , but stronger , immortal as Charlemagne 's was not . A land under God , where education and art were valued as the most precious of human accomplishments . An empire kept safe by the strength he would give it , where books would not be burned nor children butchered . The Empireof the Celts , of harps and hospitality , of poetry and peace . But it must be won by the sword . He began to be hungry for this thing that had never been . With Deirdre he was gentle and wary , always conscious on some level of the wounds within her that might break open once more . When she was tired she grew fretful , and her tears fell as easily as a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . She could not be joked with , nor could she endure casual play in bed . Indeed , the act of begetting children required her total forbearance , and he was aware of it . But though she felt no pleasure in their conception , she took pleasure in the little ones themselves , and it was the beliefof everyone that her babies kept her quiet and sane . There was never any question of putting them out to fosterage . Noble families routinely exchanged children , to strengthen the ties between them , but , when Aed mentioned it in a passing conversation , Fithir silenced him with a stern glare . " My sister 's children will be raised in her household and no other , seanchai ! They do her more good than all your wisdom or the physician 's medicaments . " " But it is the tradition , my lady . Young ones are being sent to Cashel from the four corners of Munster in accordance with the custom , and they expect like in return , or how else can we be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The king and I will have many children and see one in every powerful tribe in the land , if that will insure peace . But speak no more of sending Deirdre 's away , and ask the Brehons not to mention it to her ; even a whisper might do her harm . " Aed was saddened . Any break with tradition was a sacrilegeto him , and though not every family participated in the ritual of fosterage he believed deeply in the wisdom of thep274custom . He also saw , with the eyes of the observant , that Fithir was moving past her childbearing years and had not yetconceived . She holds Brian 's children close to warm her own heart , as well as for her sister 's sake , he thought . The youngsters wove a thread of merriment through Cashel . Murrough in particular was the light in his father 's eyes . He lacked Brian 's serious side , but he was a sturdy little fellow , scrappy and full of pranks , and he poured his enormousenergy and opinionated spirit into everything he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much his own person , and Brian delighted in him , even as he tried to control his more headstrong impulses . It was Murrough who was responsible for the scurry of cats at Cashel . As soon as he was old enough to straddle a pony he had ranged far from the Rock , fearless as an eagle , returningat day 's end with some present to placate his parents . Once it was a cloakful of squirming cats . " A little girl in the woods gave them to me , father , " he explained to an amused Brian . " She said her mother wanted you to have them ! " Brian cocked an eyebrow and tried to appear serious . " And what would I be doing with a tribe of kittens ? Are you sure this is n't your latest army , little general ? " " Oh , no , my lord ! " Murrough insisted . " I was told they were a gift for you . To keep down mice , I expect , " he added earnestly . The cats were incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they became more particularly , as Brian had expected , the playfellows of his oldest son . Murrough liked having his own way . On the eve of the young prince 's eighth birthday , Brian and Padraic were returning with a company of warriors from a skirmish exercise , a war game Brian had devised to keep his troops battle-ready in the absence of Northmen . Padraic , Brian 's shadow , had come to be more than an aide ; he was as much of a confidant as Brian would allow himself , and the younger man was proud and jealous of his position . They were discussing the morrow 's festivities . " The boyp275will be pleased with the banquet planned in his honor , I think , " Brian told Padraic . " My brother the king intends to be back from Bruree , where he has gone to hold out the hand of friendship to Donovan of Hy Carbery . Bishop Marcan will be celebrating Mass , and that wild boar I speared in Graedhe 's Woods is turning on the spit this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a king ! " " The son of the real king of Munster , " Padraic said , almost under his breath . " Hush , " Brian reprimanded him sternly . " I wo n't have you saying such things , even in private . " " In all but name ... " " Enough ! " Brian 's voice cut him off sharply . " The son of the king will be Mahon 's first-born in marriage , if he has one . I belive that a strong dynasty passed from father to son would be the best way of insuring stability for us . As for myself , I have no kingship to offer my heirs , so I must give them something else ; something of more value , perhaps . " " What could that be , my lord ? " Brian 's eyes stared forward , through Time . " A legend , " he said . " I want to know , before I die , that when I am gone the harpers in the halls will still sing of me . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that my children will remember me , not only as their sire , but as a force that shaped the world they will inherit , a source of pride to be handed down to their children 's children . " " You are already a legend among your men , my lord , " Padraic assured him . " Thank you for that , my friend . I work at it , as well you know ; you 've seen my hands shake when I make speeches , and you know that I deliberately conceal them , so they do not spoil the image . The books I study , the lessons I set myself to learn  --  they are all part of something I am building piece by piece . Each bit of it must fit perfectly with the others . " " How can you know when it does ? " Padraic asked . " In the same way a singer knows he has sung the right note , or a harper knows to touch the strings that create a chord that feeds his soul . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it will all be put to use , Padraic . I do n't know when or how , but everything I have made of myself will be of value someday . " Padraic 's eyes shone . " You believe in destiny , my lord ? " Brian 's answer was firm . " I believe in myself . I was given a good mind and a strong body , which gifts obligate me to use them to the best of my ability . I was given a hunger for power , which some men might call evil , but I believe that it can be a force for great good . The only alternative to educated power is brute force , mindless , inhuman , a rolling stone that crushes everything in its path . That is infinitely more immoral than ability used wisely , Padraic . " I can not deny my ambition  --  not to myself , nor to you . The addiction to power is the end result of a long series of small seductions . It begins as a reaction to some real or imaginedinjustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a pearl , layer by layer . The layers men build are of strength , influence , the ability to get things done . " All the power I possess or can gain will be used to win something more than a mere kingship , Padraic ; something I can hand down to my sons with great pride . " They were nearing the Rock . The road broadened and was harder , beaten down by many feet , rutted by carts and the wheels of an occasional chariot . Soft gray stone , moss frosted , edged up through the thin crust of the soil like bare knees pushing through worn trews . A skittering of midges thickened the air . A speck was racing down the road toward them , pursued by a cloud of dust . As it drew near it resolved itself into a man on horseback , hair streaming , eyes wild . He sawed on the rein and set his mount on its haunches directly under the nose of Brian 's own animal . " My lord ! Fearsome news ! " In reflex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , " he commanded . " The king has been taken captive , my lord ! It is a piece of the most dreadful treachery ! "  |p277Beneath  the bronze of his wind-burned skin , the blood fled from Brian 's face . " How do you know this ? " " Some of those who went with him to Bruree escaped and have just returned to Cashel , my lord , in dreadful condition . They fled for their lives across Munster and arrived but an hour ago . They say that instead of receiving King Mahon as an honored guest in his home , that whoreson Donovan laid hands upon him as soon as he arrived and bound him with ropes and chain . He 's being delivered like butcher 's meat , handed over to Molloy of Desmond and his foreign allies ! " A dreadful moan was wrung from Brian . " I warned him ! God , I ... he would n't listen ! He was so certain ... he said Christ was with him in all things ... he said he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Mahon ! Oh , Mahon ! Your Christian duty , you called it turned to Padraic and flung his hands wide . " I tried to keep him from going to Donovan and asking for one of his sons to raise at Cashel . You heard me , Padraic ! I told him it was a mistake . Did n't I ? Did n't I ? " Padraic felt as if he had just been told that the sun would not rise in the morning . " Yes , my lord , " he said faintly . King Mahon ... ? It seemed impossible . " Why would n't he listen to me ? " Brian went on , rocking back and froth on his horse in the excess of his emotion . " I understood Desmond and Hy Carbery better than he did . Those are proud men , with long memories , and they bear grudges . Mahon forgives ... forgave ... I knew they had not . " He doubled one impotent fist and pounded it against the rock-hard muscle of his thigh . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment in the meaningless rhythm of the beating hand . " I should have stopped him .. . stopped him ... " " What 's this ? " The officers were crowding around now , scenting bad news . " The king is taken ? " " What of the safeguards he was given from the bishop and clergy of Cork ? " someone asked . " He put much trust in them . "  |p278The  messenger shook his head . " Donovan laughed at them . " " Bishop Marcan will be angered to hear that ! " cried Kian , running up in time for the worst of the news . " And what of the holy symbol the king had pinned to his breast ? I saw it myself , the gold reliquary with a gold cross upon it , and a fragment of the gospel of Saint Finnbarr inside . " " I know not , " was the reply . " All that gold  --  Donovan probably stole it , " a voice growled . " That short-beard bastard ! That clay-coated sea slug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not at this distance , " Brian growled , recovering himself a little . " Let 's get on to Cashel and determine what 's to be done . " They were met by uproar . Fithir , with queenly calm , had taken charge of the household , but the hall and yards were a-swirl with nobles and warriors , weeping servants and scurryingpriests . Olan , pensioned off in the time of peace , came thundering in with his sword in his hand and the scars on his old face livid with rage . " How could you let this happen ? " he roared at Brian as soon as he saw him . Brian did not take time to answer . There was blame enough to go round , and the coldness in his breast told him that he would absorb it all himself when he had the leisure to reflect . But for now there were orders to be given , organizationto be wrought out of chaos , and the entire community looked to him . He convened the council of state and heard the pitiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's retinue who had been allowed to escape . Only the king 's hide was of value to Donovan . " I fear they will kill him , my lord ! " Mahon 's steward exclaimed . " Do n't say that ; we must not even think it . Grief and fear will weaken us and given them the advantage , and this situationmust be handled quickly , with all our cleverness . " Thep279steward stood before the council table , tears rolling down his cheeks . He had been but a man 's length from Mahon when the traitors seized him . Brian fought to get his attention . " Tell me ... tell me ! ... are you certain they are taking him to the prince of Desmond ? " " We believe so , my lord , " the man sobbed . " And are the Northmen involved ? Look up and answer me ; you can cry later . Are the Northmen involved in this thing ? " The steward made a valiant effort to control himself . " They are tied into it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronghold at Bruree we had news of the presence of Ivar 's men in the neighborhood . Some of the nobleswanted to turn back , but the king would n't listen . " Brian turned to the councilors . " I have feared this ever since Ivar came back from Wales . He has sulked too long at a distance , brewing up his mischief , and I told my brother more than once that a placid surface does not mean there are no treacherous currents beneath . We have done all we could to intimidate them with our arms and our power , but Molloy has never lost his hunger for Cashel nor the Northmen their taste for revenge . The question is , now that they have acted , how can we thwart their intent ? " " We must send the army in full might to Desmond ! " Kernac thundered , banging his walking stick on the floor . The one-legged veteran had a seat of honor on the council , and though it took two men to lift him he was still considered a warrior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken to him , " Brian said . " These men tell us he was gone from Bruree in chains on the night of his capture . He is Molloy 's by now . " Olan 's voice was sepulchral . " Unless they have taken him north , to give him directly into Ivar 's hands . The cowards may prefer to have Ivar do their murdering for them . " Kernac shook his head . " Molloy must hate Mahon very much by now . I doubt he would let Ivar have the satisfaction of killing him . Either way , the king is a dead man . "  |p280The  men gathered in the council chamber argued far into the night , seeking hope and finding none , snatching up plans and discarding them . But the urgency was gone ; they all knew they were howling into the wind . Mahon 's fate was in God 's hands . As Brian at last stumbled from the chamber , gritty-eyed and longing for a few hours of oblivion before he assembled the army for the inevitable march , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber . " Father ? " He peered down at the sturdy boy standing in front of him . His own face , with Deirdre 's coloring , looked back at him . " You should be abed , Murrough ! Where is your nurse , or your mother ? " " Oh , they think I 'm asleep ! I tiptoed ! But I could n't stay in bed , not after I heard about the king . Will they kill him ? " The simple childish question demanded equal candor . " Yes , " said Brian , feeling strangely that he was condemning his brother to death by admitting it . Murrough looked up  --  far up  --  at the awesome figure toweringabove him . To have such a man for a father was the source of much pride , and no little boasting to the sons of the other nobles , but in truth he was shy in Brian 's presence and half afraid . The great prince was always so busy , so preoccupied . A boy 's foolishness was an embarrassment compared to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uo enough nerve to demand attention . Tonight was an exceptional time . " If he dies , will you be king ? " Murrough asked . Brian groaned inwardly . There was no way to answer that . He looked down at the earnest young face , then slowly lowered his weary body to crouch beside his son on the cold stone floor . Seen that way Brian became more human , and Murrough ventured a shy smile . " I mean , I 'd be very sorry to see the king dead , for he has always been kind to me . I 'll sing at his wake if I am permitted , and I 'll take part in the funeral games and win a race in his honor . " He tried very hard to pitch hisp281voice lower and sound mature , and he stood with his legs braced apart and his back very straight . His eyes were shining . " But I will be proud of you , my lord , if you are made king , " he added . " You 'd be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of his words . Brian 's face darkened in the torchlight , then crumpled like a linen napkin . His shoulders heaved . A sound came from him , a wordless noise , a cry of suffering such as Murrough had never heard his father utter . Brian stood up and wrapped the boy in his arms , puffing Murrough tight against his chest , so that the boy felt his father 's tremendous strength and wondered how he knew just how hard to squeeze without causing pain . Brian 's voice rumbled around him , " My son , my son . Some day there will be genuine peace in Ireland , and then we 'll have time to spend together and get to know one another . I promise it . " He released the child reluctantly , his arms still tingling with the feel of his son , and the love that must be put aside for more pressing matters choked in his throat . He could not let go and indulge himself in feeling ; there might be no way to get back . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down the passageway . " Get back to your warm bed , Murrough , " he ordered , " and leave me to the task at hand . " " You 're going to rescue the king ? " asked the eager voice . Brian could not answer . He went to his chamber and looked longingly at the bed . Then with a deep sigh he summoned a page and sent for his maps of the land of Desmond . He dashed cold water on his face and knuckled his reddened eyes , then sat down with the charts spread before him and began calculating distances and times . Beyond Cashel , the sky turned ashen with the false promise of dawn . Wearied beyond weariness , Brian at last slumped back on his seat , his right arm lying across the table , his left arm fall/ing of its own weight to dangle beside him . A measure of time passed . Something brushed against those inert fingers . A whisper of fur touched his skin and was gone , only to return with a gentle , insistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian could envision one of the cats pacing back and forth in a small figure eight , pleading silently for his attention . He stretched out his hand and the cat filled it , setting up a happy humming . Idly , he stroked the narrow back , feeling it hump up to accept his caress and lift its tail to stop the gesture so that he might begin again . His fingers explored the fragile skull , seeking out those places beneath the chin and at the base of the ears where a skillful rubbing could send a cat into raptures . Beautiful silk and sinew creature , made by its Creator to be uniquely graceful . Gentle , savage , vulnerable , yet willing to offer a moment 's trust . Without ever looking down he found himself smiling , and the cat knew it and responded , expandingthe volume of its purring until the vibrations were carried up Brian 's arm and throughout his being . Somehow , magically , the pall of weariness lifted from him and was gone . Time spiraled inward on itself and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and disappeared from the room . The road was not even a good cart track , merely a narrow serpentine of a path worn by cattle in search of water . It wound through the heather and climbed toward a tumble of mountains . Peering ahead through the morning mist , Mahon recognized the approach to the pass of Barnaderg . " We are near Ballyorgan ? " he asked the man leading his horse.  |p283The  guard turned toward him , his dark face sullen under a thatch of tangled hair . " Aye , " he said , and spat . He gave the leadrope a rough jerk and the horse broke into a jolting trot . Mahon 's wrists were bound behind his back with rope that sawed endlessly at the skin , but at least the heavy chains had been removed so that he could ride . He was in the center of a hollow square of armed men ; not a guard of honor but of menace . Donovan had stood at the gates of Bruree to see them off , a satisfied smirk on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock salute when Mahon was led past him . " Fare you well , king ! " he had taunted . " You have broken the sacred obligation of hospitality , " Mahonreplied in a voice rimed with frost . " You are unfit to speak to me ! " " Praise God , I shall never have to again , " Donovan told him . They moved into the narrow pass of Barnaderg , and the stony path was hard on the horses . The guards pulled Mahon from his mount and ordered him to walk . The trail was full of rocks and several times he stumbled , falling once to his knees . The captain ordered the binding removed from his hands then . " After all , " he laughed , " this is a gift from Donovan to Molloy of Desmond , and we want to be certain it is delivered in good condition ! " Hostile laughter rippled through the ranks of armed men . Mahon held his head high and tried not to hear . He had known since they left Bruree that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell him why . It was best to hope that he would be held for ransom , humiliated perhaps , pressured to give up the kingship of Munster . If only they knew , he thought , how gladly I would relinquish it ! It can be taken from me by the merest twist of the wrist  --  but not from my brother . They will have to deal with him , and that is a very different matter . They may not realize how differentThe thought of Brian started his heart thudding with hope . Surely by now word of his capture had , reached Cashel ; many of his party had been allowed to flee the scene . Brian wouldp284come to get him , all flags flying ! His eyes brightened with the thought of the impending rescue , but then he felt his soul counting the number who would die in the battle . More blood on my head . There must be some way to prevent it . " Please , listen to me for a moment ! " he called to the captain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? " His voice was flat , without respect . " Do you know ... what is planned for me ? " " I do n't know , and I do n't really care . You stole Cashel from its rightful heirs , and it 's up to them to decide what 's to be done with you . I only have orders to turn you over to the prince of Desmond in good condition . " They filed through the pass in silence . In the distance they could see men coming up to meet them , and as they drew nearer Mahon 's guard commented , " It appears you are to be treated better than you deserve . There is the escort sent from Molloy , and I can make out priests among them , so you 'll be handled fairly . " Mahon squinted ; then he too was able to see the little group of men in clerical robes walking with the others . " The prince is kinder than I had hoped , " he said with relief . " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carrying it when I meet my brothers in Christ . " " You nobles always like to make a big impression , " the guard grumbled , but he signaled to one of the men to fetch the Bible . Mahon received it with thanksgiving . Ever since they had stolen Saint Finnbarr 's relic from him he had felt peculiarlyalone , almost as if God had deserted him . But now he was in touch again . Everything would be all right . Within view of the pass but a safe distance from it , Molloy of Desmond waited with a band of his followers and a company of armed men . He saw the tiny figures of the two groups merge ; raising one hand , he fingered the massive ruby that hung around his neck on a chain of silver . " Enough of silver , " he said to the man nearest him . " I was born for gold . "  |p285Donovan  's men , their mission accomplished , stepped back and left Mahon alone to meet his escort . He stood straight , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he would greet anyone as the king of Munster . A sunbeam broke through the overcast and haloed his hair . Ignoring the soldiersadvancing upon him , he smiled a greeting at the little band of clergymen who walked with them . And then he looked at the soldiers , who were not pausing to salute him . He saw their intent in their faces , and he knew . Knowing , he was aware that he wanted to meet death with courage , to die as a Christian martyr with Christ 's holy name on his lips . He saw the death blow coming at him and realized , with a soldier 's knowledge , that it would cleave his torso and his gushing blood would soak the Bible he carried , obliteratingGod 's sacred word . He flung the book wildly from him , trying to hurl it into the safe haven of a thornbush , but his aim was bad and he hit one of the priests square on the chest . The startled man , only just becoming aware that murder was about to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared open mouthed at Mahon . The upraised sword sliced toward him . Mahon lifted his chin to meet the coming darkness  --  and at the last moment something within him gave way without his permission , and he dodged sideways and tried to run . Molloy saw the downward flash of the sword in the sun . It was done , then . He wanted to cheer . He looked around and called for his horse , and as he did so a puzzled voice asked at his elbow , " What is it you want me to do ? " An elderly priest , one of the number he had summoned to give this occasion its spurious sanctity , stood beside him lookingpuzzled . He had stayed behind when his fellows went to meet the Dalcassian , and now he was unaware what had happenedand was peering at the distant scene in bewilderment . Molloy swung onto his horse 's back . " I 'll tell you what you can do , " he said . " Cure yonder man if he should come top286you ! " Laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galloped away . The other priests came running back over the broken ground , their faces ashen with shock and horror . " Murder ! Murder ! " they cried , crowding around the old one , repeating themselves endlessly in their disbelief . " We have been used as dupes , as bait ! We have been tricked into mocking God ! Insteadof going to meet Mahon of Munster and seeing to his safety , we lured him to his death . He is killed , murdered , when he thought himself welcomed to the bosom of the Church ! " A thrill of revulsion ran through them . Some fell to their knees to pray for the fallen king . Others went back , drawing strength from the company of one another , and approached the place where he lay , quite alone now , staring at the sky . They shut his eyes and covered him with their cloaks after they had administered the last kind offices of their calling . " We must send word to his household , and to the bishop of Cork , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we were ; the princes of Desmond told him they were anxious for peace when all they really wanted was to get this good man in their grasp and kill him . " One of the younger priests shook his head as he wiped his blood-stained hands on his clothes . " It will not go well with Prince Molloy for having done this evil thing . " He looked with distaste at the brown smear on the rough gray wool . " But who will punish him ? " he asked . There would be no shining rescue . They brought Mahon back to Cashel on a cart , his multicolored cloak of kingship spread over him . The priest who had caught his Bible accompaniedhim ; he had wept as he laid the book atop the dead king 's chest . " I would have taken the blow myself , if I had known it was coming , " he told all who would listen . But it was too late . The skies wept for Mahon . A tomb was prepared for the murdered king in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had buried a husband before , squeezed her plumpness into the same gown of mourning andp287felt a pang of guilt . " What kind of a woman am I , to have outlived two men ? " she asked her maid . " Fortunate , " was the succinct reply . Mahon was to rest in hallowed ground at Cashel , a stone tomb shielding his bones , a stone cross above him . The sombercelebrants of the funeral ritual arrived to pay him homage , fewer than had attended his coronation . The political wind had taken an unexpected shift ; a man must keep his allegiancesfluid and not be too conspicuous in his mourning . Brian was a tall column of inheld pain . It burned in the hollows of his gray eyes . From the moment they learned Mahonwas dead , he had been the prisoner of an accumulation of guilts whose voices were louder than the keening of the mourners . I sought his death , Brian 's inner voice accused him endlessly . I stood over him as he slept and planned to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely as Molloy must have done . It was only by God 's grace that mine was not his assassin 's hand . Once I wanted him dead . Wished for it . And now his lifeless body lies at Cashel , surrounded by candles . Once I dreamed of the things I could accomplish if only I had his power . And now the kingship of Munster is vacant . But sweet Jesus , how can I believe that my brother 's murder is God 's way of answering my prayers ? What kind of God is that ? He writhed and twisted inwardly , and no one saw . I almost killed him once , that merciless voice reminded him . And perhaps , because of me and my ambition , another man has acted as my surrogate and completed that crime . I thought I had escaped the guilt of it , but now I never can . My brother is sacrificed to a dream that was not his . He had begun to find serenity within himself , the peace which this world would not grant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with myselfWhat can I possibly do to make the life that is left me worth the price he paid ? Brian went out into the rain and stood alone at the edge of the area where the tomb was being prepared . The workmenp288saw him , a gaunt figure wrapped in a dark cloak , but they stayed out of his way and avoided his eyes . Cahal came to him at last , braving the weather and glaring up at the skies as if his annoyance would lessen the downpour . He had to put his hand on Brian 's arm and squeeze hard before the prince would turn and look at him . " We 're all worried , my lord ! " he called above the incessant rain . " Desmond will be marching on us soon , I fear ; there 's no doubt that he will claim the kingship now , and decisions must be made immediately . " Brian looked at him from a far distance . It took a while before he recognized Cahal , and then another space of time before Cahal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babble . Kingships . Politics . More fighting . It took a tremendous effort of will to focus on those things , and keep his eyes away from the tomb being built for his brother . " Molloy will not profit from his crime , " Brian said at last in a dead voice . " But what 's to be done ? Now that he has shown himself to be strong he will find new allies and the Owenachts will rally behind him . And there 's Ivar ... " Brian turned away as if the subject held no interest for him . " We will talk of it later , " he said dully . He was not to be left alone with his pain . There were too many questions and no answers , and , apologetically , the chieftains and officers sought him out , demanding that he put aside the indulgence of grief and give thought to the urgencies of the living . He spoke with them at last in the king 's council chamber , where the empty High Seat loomed as a stark reminder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all clamored to know . The tuath-kings , each with his own family and small communityto care for ; the princes who claimed the allegiance of many tuath.s ; the officers whose men were waiting in their tents and in the muddy fields  --  they crowded together like nervous horses about to bolt at a clap of thunder , and Brian smelled their fear in the room.  |p289He  still wore the clothes he had worn as he stood in the rain beside his brother 's unfinished tomb . They dripped into an icy puddle at his feet . " I have promised Cahal of Delvin More that the prince of Desmond will not make a triumph of King Mahon 's killing , " he told them . " The treacherous Molloy shall not rule Munster , giving away its riches to his Norse allies and destroying all we have built . Each year of my brother 's reign saw less warfare and more folk fairs , and that is the way it must continue in his memory . The murderers will be punished and peace secured , and a new order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " they asked , surprised . " This outrage was committed because the old laws of successionencouraged it , " Brian said in an impassioned voice . " Kings have been chosen from alternate tribes in an effort to placate everyone , which in reality only sets one side against the other . The result is that a man like Molloy now thinks he has a perfect right to rule Munster just because it 's his turn . " But I tell you , the continuation of that policy will keep our land forever fragmented , the tribes at war with one another . The king should be the man best qualified to rule , a man blessed with strength and prepared by education . We must have one royal family , one dynasty , one unity of vision and purpose . We must have the one strong bloodline capable of producing generations of able leaders . Tradition is not sacrosanct ; a bad tradition must be set aside and a better one es-tablished . " " But it is n't done that way ! " Aed exclaimed , scandalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with determination . In the damp meadows below the Rock of Cashel , the commonfolk gathered to pray for their dead king . In small groups along the muddy road , in little clusters beneath the dripping trees , they kept their vigil . Some carried lighted candlesto cut through the gloom of the day , showing their respectwith that small extravagance . Some carried crucifixes . Many had come a long distance , across countryside made safe during Mahon 's reign.  |p290The  nobles passed them by , riding up the road to the fortress . At the very edge of the road , half hidden in a clump of young birch trees , a woman stood . A small brown woman , wrapped in a common bratt  --  she might almost have been a deer , watching there . A child crouched beside her . In their hands they held not crucifixes but mistletoe , and their lips moved in prayer like the Christians . But they were not Christians . Fiona kept her watch throughout the long day , ignoring her tired feet and aching back , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might speak a word to his brother 's people . The child grew fretful and whined , and she took some dried meat from the bag slung at her waist and shared it with the little girl . " Be still , " she admonished her . " You will be a woman in a very few years ; you must learn patience . I promise you we will go home , when all is over . " In the king 's hall at Cashel , his subjects assembled to say their last good-byes . The funeral games had been played , the victors of each race and contest eulogized by Aed and given silver circlets according to the custom . The banquet tables were spread with food ; the air was crowded with praises and reminiscences of the dead king . Harps and tympans were played without ceasing , even as the commonfolk below the Rock played their own bagpipes in memoriam . It was the final day . The tomb was ready ; the body would wait no longer . It lay on a trestle in the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet . Upon the dead king 's chest were his Bible and the crown of Munster , a dull gold in the melancholy light . All those who loved him were gathered for the leavetaking , the hour when Mahon would leave his hall for the last time , to be carried by a guard of honor to the damp tomb beneath the dripping rocks . In turn , they had each knelt before the bier , heads bowed , hearts full . It was not a day to be stingy with tears ; as Aed reminded them . " The gift , of tears is the mark of a noble soul . " Mahon 's subjects wept without restraint.  |p291Last  to come forward was Brian . When only Fithir remainedat Mahon 's side , seated on the floor , her unbound hair streaming over her heaving bosom , her keening shrill in the hall  --  Brian entered the room . The onlookers raised their eyes to him , and some gasped . He was dressed in a single garment , an aged and ragged tunic belted at his waist with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular dark blotches , so old that they might have been woven into the fabric . The briars of Thomond had torn that tunic , and Norse blood as well as Irish was on it . He wore it as if it were ermine . In one hand he carried his naked sword , in the other the little harp he sometimes played for Deirdre . Brian knelt at the king 's feet and laid the sword there . I am here , brother . You wanted me to suffer , and I am suffering . But I promise you , your death was not my desire . I am as hurt by the sight of destruction as you wished me to be , and a lifetime would not be enough for my atonement if I chose to spend it in sackcloth and ashes , blaming myself for this . But I will not . The time for blame is over . I must go on . He rose and turned to face outward , his back to the silent figure on the bier . He lifted the harp and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other harpers fell silent , and Brian alone played the last music for Mahon , son of Cennedi . He began with the Gentrai , the laughing , merry strains that evoked the boy his brother had once been . The lilting tune brought a smile to the lips and an invitation to the feet , as if death were a thing with no power to still the joy of living . The music drifted , changed , sank into the heartbreaking lamentof the Goltrai , the keening for the dead . A thousand years of tears were in the voice of the harp , a liquid inconsolablegrief as old as the loss of Eden . The music was woodsmokeand a doe 's eyes , the pain of a child 's grave , the emptiness of the winter sea . The cry of the banshee floated down the wind , and children clung to their mothers ' knees and shivered.  |p292The  hands that could wield the heaviest ax flickered delicatelyover the strings . Brian 's deep , strong voice rose with the music and filled the hall . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cashel the renowned ; Alas , alas that he fell not in battle , Under cover of his broad shield ; Alas that in friendship he trustedTo the treacherous word of Donovan . It was an evil deed for MolloyTo murder the great and majestic king ; And if my hand retains its powerHe shall not escape my vengeance . Either I shall fall  --  without dread , without regret= Or he will meet a sudden death by my hand ; I feel that my heart will burstIf I avenge not our noble king . " When the lament died away , the sobbing in the hall was being healed in the first flush of anger , and men and women with tear-stained faces were holding their clenched fists in the air . Someone began it  --  almost in a whisper : " Born ! Boru ! "  --  and one voice after another took it up . The chant rose , swelled , filled the hall . " Baru ! Born ! " Brian stood erect then , his face unreadable . He felt the presence of the martyred man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and clear , though stained with blood . The blood could not be put back in the ruined body . The opportunity to set foot on the road might never come again . He laid down his harp and picked up the sword , thrusting it through his belt . " Born ! " they cried . With hands he forced to be steady he lifted the gold circlet from the dead king 's chest , and placed it on his own head.  |p293And  the roar that was raised in the hall of Cashel thundered out across the green land . It took two years to get them all . There were those who threw the epithet Usurper. / more savagely at Brian than they ever had at his brother , and refused him men or aid . There were traditionalists who listened and nodded at his wisdom and yet refused to sanction a break with the past , and those who were afraid , and those who might be won over by long conversations far into the night . The time had come for Brian of Boruma to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one immediate goal : Mahon 's killers must be punished , must be denied even the smallest reward for their crime . He began with Ivar . The leadership of the Dal Cais and the control of Thomond were Brian 's at his brother 's death , for no man stood to claim them from him . He made good use of his new power . The officers who had shared the last , desperate stand with him in the mountains beyond Boruma were placed in charge of the entire army of Thomond , and every man who could fight was summoned to attack Ivar in his stronghold on Scattery Island . Brian himself led the attack on the earthen walls the Northmenhad hastily erected on the island , riding to Scattery in one of the boats craftsmen were hurrying to build to his order on Munster 's waterways . In his hand he carried an Irish sword  --  he would not kill Ivar with a Norse ax  --  and he nursed his hatred in his heart as a thrifty woman nurses a flame on the hearth on a cold night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he isp294mine , " Brian warned his men repeatedly . " If any man puts a mark on him first , that man shall answer to me . Fight well , use your soldiers carefully , and put no one in unnecessary danger  --  and as soon as you find Ivar , send for me . " But there was no need to send for Brian . He was in the forefront of the attack that charged through the doorway to the room where Ivar waited , an old man past his fighting days , the rot of age in his joints and sinews . Brian waved his men back and advanced on the Norse king alone . " You are Ivar Amlayson ? " he asked in his heavily accentedNorse . Ivar gave no vocal answer , merely bared his remaining teeth in the practiced and mirthless grin of a warrior and waited . But his eyes were still keen ; he clearly saw the man who stood before him , tall as the tallest Northman , with the history of Ireland on his face . There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw Ivar glance at it . " You have no weapon ? " he asked . Ivar glared at him and gave a curt shake of his head . " I need no weapon against an Irish dog , " he snarled . Some of the tension went out of Brian . Here was a chance , one of those golden moments that can be turned to immortal treasure by the alchemy of a bard 's retelling . He made himselfsmile at Ivar . " I understand your belief is that you must die with a sword in your hand to reach Valhalla , Northman ; is that not so ? " Ivar watched him , narrowing his eyes . He knew the fellow was using him . If he had been younger , stronger ... ah , but it hardly mattered anymore . Because he was old his men had deserted him and left him to die , the vaunted brotherhood of the Northmen forgotten , corrupted by this alien land . Death was no stranger , and Valhalla was a promise given a child and soon forgotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sword at Ivar . " I would not deny any man his heaven , nor kill any enemyin cold blood as was done to my brother . Fight for your life or your death , foreigner ! "  |p295Ivar  's shocked mind reacted with the old quickness , but his hands were slower . He grabbed at the sword , caught it , fumbledit , and struggled to lift its weight while Brian stood unarmed , watching him , smiling . And when at last he held it firmly , the hilt clasped in both his hands and his feet parted in as good a fighting stance as he could manage , Brian came toward him . Unarmed . Smiling . Ivar lay dead of a broken back in the heart of his last stronghold , while its buildings were ignited by Irish torches to provide his funeral pyre . Two of Ivar 's sons lay dead on the banks of the island ; the oldest , Harold , had fled safely to his old ally Donovan . Crouched in hiding in a wooden chest in one of the storerooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother Ilacquin heard the first crackle of the flames without realizing what they represented . Then he smelled smoke , and thrust violently against the tightly fitted lid of the chest . Irish swords were preferable to being roasted alive ! But the chest was strongly made , and the damp air of Scattery Island had caused the wood to swell . Doubled up within it , Ilacquin was unable to get enough room to straighten his arms and force it open . Growing desperate , he hammered against the lid , yelling for someone to come and help him . Only the roar of the fire answered . Hungry , insatiable , the flames surrounded the chest and licked the wood with eager tongues . As the frantic Ilacquin at last broke free of his prison , a gust of air swept the room and the blaze leaped high , igniting his clothes and turning him into a living , screaming torch . He did not scream for long . Brian and his men laid waste to the rest of the island , then turned south toward the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary of Mahon 's death Bruree was burned to the ground , and Donovan and Harold Ivarson slain , together with a vast number of their followers . On the charred trunk of a sycamore that had stood by Donovan 's gate Brianp296left a banner hanging , its defiant three lions clawing the breeze . Those who might have stood with Molley sided with him no longer . He waited in Desmond , watching a thin trickle of men desert him every day . " My mistake was one of ignorance , " he lamented to his wife on the privacy of their pillow . " I saw Mahon and thought he was the king , the obstacle in my path , and assumed his brother was merely his general . I have destroyed the weaker man and brought the stronger down on my head . " " You had no way of knowing , a mhuirnin , " his wife said , trying to comfort him . Molloy sat up on the bed and nursed his knees . " I should have known , " he muttered . " I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I challengedthem . That 's the way Boru does it . But I mocked Mahon and made sport of his clergy , and now there is an avenging angel at Cashel , honing the edge of his sword andII ' 1 thirsting for my blood . " " You always tempted God . You laughed at His priests and defied his commandments , and I warned you and warned you about it . You know I did . I told you many times ... " " Oh , be quiet , " Molloy groaned , turning his back to her . The months passed , and Brian let Molloy wait , knowing the fear that sickened and weakened him . It was pleasant to drowse in bed at night , safe , sure , the strong stone walls embracinghim ; or lie in front of his tent in the army camp , watching the stars wheel above him , and imagine the agony of Molloy , waiting . It was part of the punishment . " I 'm a vindictive man , Padraic , " he commented one day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sure you 're not , my lord , " his aide was quick to reply . But Brian refused to have his self-knowledge muddied by illusion . " No , it 's true , " he insisted . " I can harbor a grudge for years , and I never forget an insult or slight . The priests tell me these are weaknesses I must overcome , and my brother Marcan prays for me to be given a more forgiving spirit . Hep297can afford to pray  --  vengeance is not in his province ; he has God for that . Munster has me . " It occurred to Padraic that Brian was not ashamed of his vengeful nature ; he even appeared proud of it . Brian was proud of many things , including his own pride . Yet surely these were sins .. . Brian made them sound like virtues . Padraic shook his head and smiled good-naturedly . " I must confess I do n't always understand what you say , my lord , " he told Brian , " but the way you say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , Brian grew weary of the game . The satisfaction was wrung out of it . He sent the prince of Desmonda formal challenge to battle , instructing the envoy to make it plain to Molloy that no truce or peace would be acceptedand no payment taken for the murdered king . Nothing would do but open battle . There was no reply . For two years , ever since Mahon 's death , Brian had had agents in Desmond , reporting to him on Molloy 's every move . He was determined that the man not slip through his fingers ; no ship would take him , no foreign port welcome him . Molloywas to wait , feeling the sands run out of his glass , until Brian was ready for him . And now Brian was ready . He sought out Deirdre , to tell her personally and as gently as possible that the time had come for one more campaign . He found her with the children , her lap piled with sewing . The needle flashed in her thin fingers  --  when had she gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teigue , who leaned against his mother 's knee , begging for a story . " Did n't I tell you a tale yestereven ? " Deirdre asked him , a smile at the corner of her mouth . The boy looked up at her with innocent eyes . " I do n't remember it , " he said flatly . Emer , shocked , contradicted him . " Yes , you do ! " she began . " It was all about the pookah , and , ... " Teigue glared across Deirdre 's lap at his sister . " I do n't re/member it ! " he proclaimed again , with more volume . " Maybe she just told you . Nobody ever tells me a story for my veryown . You get stories , and Sabia and Flann get stories , but I never ... " The laugh pulled loose from Deirdre 's lips and rippled softly about the room , warming it . Brian stood in the angle of the doorway , seeing but unseen , and found that he was listeningas eagerly as the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , just for Teigue , though I know I 've told you a score since the last Saint 's Day . " " Have n't , " Teigue murmured under his breath , pleased . They gathered around their mother 's feet , dropping to the stone floor with the boneless grace of the young . Even Murrough came and hung over the back of Deirdre 's seat , and Brian realized with a start how large the boy had grown , how soon he would be a man . Where does the time go ? We have n't begun to know each other yet , and soon he will be off with a horse and a sword . " Have I told you the story of Tir-na-n-bg ? " Deirdre asked the children . As if pulled by one string their heads moved in unison , left to right and back again . " Very well , then . It 's time you heard it as it was told to me , to give me sweet dreams in my bed at night . " Deirdre took a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the corners of the chamber . In his hidden alcove Brian strained to hear her . " Tir-na-n-Og is the land of perpetual youth , where all is beauty and death is unknown . It is the Place of Radiance . Do you know how the morning looks after a rainy night , when moisture glistens on every leaf and the bright sunshine breaks through and dazzles us ? Well , Tir-na-n-Og is like that , and it makes you feel that way as if your heart were too big to stay inside your breast . " " O0000h ! " breathed Flann . " Who lives there ? " " The ancient gods live there , the immortals who were in Ireland before the coming of Christendom . Lugh of the Silver Spear , and Dagda of the great Cauldron that gives life to thep299dead and food to the living , and Angus Og , who is the soul of poetry , and all the large and small spirits of the woods and hills . " Some people call that land Hy Brazil , the Isle of the Blest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their courage and steadfastness . It is said that the great Cuchullain himself is there , with Conchobar , and Fionn mac Cumhaill . " " And Conn the Hundred-Fighter ! " Murrough interrupted , unable to listen in silence any longer . " And his lifelong enemy Owen Mor . Aed says that once they divided Ireland between them , and Conn took the northern half and Owen Mor laid claim to all the rest , and ... " " We are not talking of battles this day , Murrough ! " Deirdre repoved him sharply . " We are not all as obsessed with fighting as you are . Sit down on your stool and listen ; it will do you good to hear something of peace and beauty . " Murrough sank back on the stool , but it was not his way to accept a rebuff or a criticism . Soon he jumped up and left the room , brushing past Brian without even noticing him . Deirdrelooked after him , and sighed . " Go on ! " Teigue begged her . " Ah ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere and nowhere , for it is not bound by the laws of time and space as we know them . Sometimes it is beneath the sea , and if you are lucky you may catch a glimpse of its crystal towers rising above the waves in the dawn . Other times it floats atop the water , appearing and vanishing again . The sainted Brendan himself set sail for it , convinced it was the lost Gardenof Eden and could be reached in a curragh if his faith was strong enough . " " Was it ? " they clamored to know . " Was his faith strong enough ? " " That 's another story , and must be told some other time , " Deirdre answered . " On clear days Tir-na-n-Og is sometimes glimpsed from the westernmost cliff 's of Ireland , and its music comes drifting over the waters like a forgotten song . Many have dived into the sea and attempted to swim to it . The dark in heart are always drowned and washed back upon thep300rocks . Only the strong and beautiful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hy Brazil . " But few truly have the ability to be happy in such a world , strange as that may seem . There are those who grow discontented , even in Tir-na-n-Og , because there is no challenge for them there . They must return to the land of the mortals and continue to fight for life and food and a bit of earth to be buried in . " " It is n't heaven you 're talldng about , is it , Mother ? " asked Conor , wrinkling his forehead . Deirdre 's smile was sad . " No , dear , it is n't heaven . Not the heaven in the Bible . It 's a pagan place , and the stories about it are so old that no one knows where they came from . " " But is it true , is there really a Tir-na-n-Og ? " Emercrowded against her mother , looking hopefully into Deirdre 's face . There are some questions that must never be answered , Brian thought . He stepped from his hiding place into the light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright leap in his wife 's eyes . Whatever malign force it was that had blighted her life with terror , it still stood between them . Cashel was not Tir-na-n-Og ; his lovely princess lived in a dark and fearful world . His children regarded him with varying degrees of awe . He stood on one side of the invisible line called adulthood , and they on the other  --  and he could never remember having crossed over . He felt a mild surprise that they did not recognizein him their own sense of wonder , of fascination with the tales which were their common heritage . But he could not drop down on the floor with them and say , " Go on , Deirdre , tell us another story . " He could not say , " Yes , there is a land of Tir-na-n-Og , and I will take you all there to be happy forever . " He could not even say , " I love you , Deirdre  --  do n't look at me like that . " " Leave us , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with your mother . " The flowerlike face she lifted to him was as beautiful asp301ever , all traces of fear carefully wiped from the shadowed violeteyes . But he knew without having to think about it that if he put a casual hand on her shoulder she would tremble , and if he stood too close to her she would shrink inside her clothes , and tolerate him . Only tolerate him . It was this place , this dark and gloomy pile of ancient stone , with its ghosts and its memories , its odors of sanctity and incense that somehow stifled children 's laughter . Mahon had wanted to turn it all into a splendid religious center , a shrine as far removed from life as Tir-na-n-Og was from reality , and had he lived there might have come a time when there were no banquet tables at Cashel , no marriage beds , no little ones racing and laughing through the passageways . And it might be better so . " My lady , I 've come to bid you good-bye for a while , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she alwaysknew . " You 're going to war again ? " " It 's Molloy of Desmond . The time has come when he must stand to account for my brother 's murder ; I can put it off no longer . I go to dispense long-overdue justice , Deirdre . " She said nothing , merely watched his face . A fantasy flickeredacross his mind : Deirdre with tears in her eyes , throwing her arms around him , begging him not to leave . A warm and passionate Deirdre , clinging to him as Fithir had clung to Mahon the morning Mahon left for Bruree . As Fiona had once clung to him . " Be careful , " Deirdre said at last , her voice very low . He had to leave her with something . " When I was a boy , " he told her , " there was a hill where I used to play . It was a piece of high ground overlooking the Shannon , not far from Boruma , and a favorite game of mine was to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her eyes were fixed on his face . " I am king now , Deirdre . King of Thomond , and , when Molloy is dead , undisputed king of Munster . And I want my own stronghold from which to rule . Let the priests have Cashel ; that will please Marcan , he can offer it as a penancep302dearly bought with blood . If you like the idea , when I come back from the west country I will have a new palace built on that hill in Thomond , a home of our very own . A place of ra-diance . " Her eyes widened ; he had heard the story she was telling , then , and was offering to build a Tir-na-n-Og for her . If she had the strength to believe in it . " Are you asking for my approval , my lord ? You are the king ; you need no one 's permission save that of God . " " I ca n't give a gift unless there is someone to receive it , Deirdre . Would you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I promise you that it will be as beautiful and secure as mortal man can make it ? " She dropped her eyes to her hands , twisting together in her lap . It was so much easier to talk to him when there were other people around ! " Yes , Brian , " she told him , her voice so soft that he had to lean over her to hear it , which alarmed her and irritated him . " What did you say ? " he snapped , feeling his good intentionsslipping away . She pitched her voice louder , so that it sounded shrill and unnatural to her own ears . " Yes , my lord ! I would be very happy to share such a palace with you ! " And then she knew that in some curious way she had hurt him , and her guilt gave her the audacity to reach out and take his big brown hand with her own small white one . " Please , Brian , " she said in a more normal tone , " I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave here ; I 've always hated this place . " He was surprised . " I did n't know that ! Why did n't you tell me ? " " I did n't know there was anything to be done about it . " " Ah , lady , there is always something that can be done . If I had known you felt that way we would never have lived here at all . We could have had a compound of our own beyond the Rock , or on the banks of the Suir . But you must share your feelings with me , Deirdre ; do n't expect me to read your mind . " " It is said that you have a gift for doing that . "  |p303He  shook his head regretfully . " It does n't work with women ! " Aware that Brian was coming for him , Molloy made one last desperate effort to recruit allies . But the name of Desmondhad lost its magic . His defiance of God had made him many enemies ; former friends shrugged eloquently and showed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his command he rode from tuath to tuath of his kingdom , waving his sword and hurling threats at Cashel , but most folk stayed indoors and barred their gates against him . Some few Northmen stood with him , but when he marched to meet Brian 's forces at Belach-Lechta he still had only a thousand men , and the full weight of southern Ireland was bearing down upon him . Belach-Lechta , near the pass of Barnaderg . A stone cross stood there to commemorate the spot where King Mahon the Dalcassian had been slain ; Brian and his officersknelt there and left a gift of flowers . The two armies came together three miles beyond . When camp was pitched before battle morning , Brian rode among his men , already savoring tomorrow 's victory and anxious to see it in their faces as well . They waved to him from their cooking fires ; relaxed , confident , aware that they had twice the number of warriors Molloy could hope to field , and Right was on their side . It was a holy war ; a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to defeat the Desmonians ; it was to be a straightforward battle , a final mopping-up of the last rebels against the new rule in Munster . A good , clean battle . Something prickled at the back of Brian 's neck , some atavistic-instinct warning him of the unexpected . He reined in his horse . His escort , led by Fergus and Reardon Bent Knee , pulled up behind him . " What is it , my lord ? " " I do n't know ... something ... when things seem to be going too easily , watch out . " He raked his keen gaze over thep304spread blanket of his army , row upon row of seasoned warriors . It was a sight to reassure , not alarm . And yet .. . An officer 's tent , pitched in the center of a company of men , rippled slightly over its surface with a passing wind . A young face , a page perhaps , or a body servant , glanced out briefly and then ducked back . Sitting on his horse , Brian froze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out , my lord . " " It does n't matter , just bring me the lad inside there . Quickly ! " He waited , tall on his horse , his face carefully clean of expression , while Reardon trotted over to the tent and vanished within . There was a sound of voices , a brief but loud protest , and then he returned , followed by Murrough . A flushed , defiant Murrough , dressed in a soldier 's tunic that lapped his boyish frame and reached his knees . He stood bright-eyed before his father , his shoulders braced . " Before God , I ca n't believe this ! " Brian swore , torn betweenanger and amusement . " Who helped you do this foolishthing , boy ? " " I did n't need anyone to help me , my lord , " Murrough answered strongly although his voice began with a suspicious quiver . " I 'm old enough to come to fight by myself . " " But not so brave that you would do it openly , it seems . Does your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Murrough stuck out his chin . " I thought not . It probably never occurred to her that you were so eager to get yourself killed . I shudder to think what she would say to me if you went home with so much as a chipped tooth . You have put us both in jeopardy , boy , and I do not thank you for it . " Brian 's men were smiling openly , their teeth flashing in their beards . Man and boy looked at each other , a generation separating them , and it was easy to see Brian 's youth reflected in his son . Even Brian recognized it , and it took a mighty effortof will to avoid being influenced by it . He turned briskly to Fergus . " Take care of this whelp , Fer/gus . See that he gets a look at the fighting , so that he 'll know what it 's about , but do n't let him get in the way . " He turned back to his son . " I 'll deal with you later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-sided , its outcome predetermined . The Northmen who had stood with Molloy deserted him as soon as they became aware of the superior numbers arrayed against them , but Brian ordered a detachment to pursue and kill them anyway . " Let the foreigners learn what it costs to interferein our affairs ! " he cried . Molloy led his men in the first few minutes of the battle , then disappeared from the scene , and with his going the heart went out of the Desmonians . The slaughter that followed was swift and harsh . Brian had given the order that men be cut down in their tracks unless they asked outright for mercy , and by the titre the sun stood overhead there were hundreds dead where once the king of Munster had died alone . Molloy was not to be found . Brian raged among his officers . " He must be captured ! That man can not be allowed to live to enjoy another sunset ! " He rounded on Cahal , who had led the assault on Molloy 's right . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The king of Delvin More snarled back , " I did , but the cowardthrew aside his princely cloak and abandoned his horse during the thick of the fighting . By the time you got to us , my lord , no one could identify him . And then he was gone en-tirely . " " Damn it ! I want every Dalcassian put to the task of findinghim ; now ! There will be no fires lit and no food eaten until I have Molloy  --  and by God , if my own Dalcassians ca n't catch him , then I 'll spread every man here over Munster like a net until that murderer stands before me . I have promised him to my sword ! " Search parties scattered in every direction . Fergus , as one of Brian 's inner circle from the outlaw days , should have beer.  |p306leading  one of the companies , but he came instead to Brian , sweat on his face and a curious expression in his eyes . " Yes , Fergus , what is it now ? " " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing also . " There was no way to tell that but baldly ; the dreadful words spat out upon the air like arrows to wound and kill . Fergus shrank from the expression in Brian 's eyes . " You 've lost my son ? " It was well known of Brian Boru that he recognized no excuses , and Fergus offered none . " I had given him my horse to hold , my lord , and placed him well behind the front line . He simply handed the horse to someone else and vanished . " Brian looked out in agony at the battlefield , where men still convulsed in the final act of dying , or shrieked and cried for water or mother . One of them might be Murrough . " Find him , " he said bleakly . Among the anxious searchers who fanned out across the countryside was a tall man on a horse . His face was so closed , his manner so forbidding that even Padraic fell back and walked a dozen paces behind him . Alone , sick at heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brian moved among the dead , looking for his son . The hut was long abandoned , tumbledown , its thatched roof reintegrated with its native soil . A great weight of hawthornleaned against it , crushing it back into the earth . No door remained , merely a crooked aperture between two saggingposts , but it was sufficient for a man to squeeze through . He stood very still , waiting for his eyes to adjust to the gloom . The air was close , dead , with a mustiness that madep307his nose itch . Sweat trickled down his neck . It was very quiet in the hut ; even the spiders that had laced its decaying walls with cobwebs were still , as if watching him . He drew a deep , shaky breath . And then another . He felt greedy for the air that meant he was still alive . No one had seen him headed this way , running doubled over among the trees , and it would be dark in a few hours . If he was still undiscoveredby then , it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by going home  --  Boru would surely have men waiting for him there . Perhaps they were already there , tying up his sons , putting their hot hands on his wife ... he swore bitterly and rubbed his hand over his eyes . The stinging salt sweat made them itch , and he swore again . Molloy of Desmond sank down against the wall and leaned back gingerly , ignoring the rustle of disturbed vermin in a pile of thatch . By looking straight up he would see a piece of blue sky . He picked at his nose , adjusted his clothing , ran through various plans in his mind and discarded them one after the other . The defeat was total ; there could be no doubt about that . All Munster would accept the Dalcassian upstart now , it would not be possible to put together a force large enough to drive him out , even if the Norsemen and the Danes could be convinced to take part in such an attempt . Which looked highly unlikely . He sat and thought about defeat . Something moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through shrubbery and then reached the collapsed door , breathing heavily . Molloy 's hand was on his sword hilt and he held very still , trapping his breath in motionless lungs . Someone squirmed through the opening and into the hut . Molloy almost laughed aloud . The newcomer was only a large child , a boy who surely had no more than ten or eleven years on him . He was wild-eyed and flushed , his black hair tangled with twigs , and when he saw Molloy he started . The prince of Desmond got to his feet and bowed with sar/castic silken courtesy . " If you 've come for hospitality I can show you little , good fellow , " he said . " I 'm new here myself . " The boy circled him warily , looking him up and down . " Who are you ? " he asked . Just a soldier who got tired of fighting , " Molloy answered casually . " This looked like a quiet place , out of harm 's way , and I thought I 'd stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a deserter , then . " " You might say that . What about yourself ? You look too young to be a warrior . " " No , I 'm not ! " The boy straightened to his full height and tossed his head , flinging aside a tumble of raven curls . " I 'm old enough to fight , and I can wield a sword as well as any man ! " " Ah-hunh . " Molloy edged sideways , trying to get the boy to follow him into the shaft of light that pierced the ruined roof . The lad looked well nourished and well dressed  --  ah , yes , when the light struck him it was obvious he had a noble 's face . Some important family would pay a good ransom to get him back . Perhaps enough to buy passage to the Cornish coast , and bribe the Munstermen to look the other way . Molloy spread an ingratiating smile across his face and held out his hand . " Come closer , lad , I wo n't hurt you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " It 's glad I am to have you here for company , my man , " Molloy continued , trying to edge closer unobtrusively . If he could get a hand on the youngster , tie him up with something .. . Murrough watched the man 's eyes above the dark beard . The lips were smiling , but the eyes were not . Murderer ! Assassin ! Murrough continued to back slowly away from him , and with one hand he sought beneath his tunic for the knife hidden there . He had been holding Fergus 's horse , chafmg with impatience and enduring the cramped muscles of one who has stood too long on tiptoe as he craned to watch the battle . And then he had seen the Desmonian slip past , cutting across the rear of Brian 's line , moving not away from those who soughtp309him but directly behind them . The man wore the plain clothingof a foot soldier , but the gilded hilt of his sword caught the light and Murrough 's attention . It must be the prince of Desmond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprised slinger standingnearby and ran in the direction of the swiftly retreating back . While ducking and dodging through the trees , it had been exciting to imagine himself confronting the treacherous prince , capturing him alone , and handing him over to Brian in triumph . In a boy 's fancy such deeds are easily done , but now , alone in the smelly hut with a grown and dangerous man , he began to realize the vast gulf between imagination and reality . Molloy was a skilled warrior , a big man with a heavy sword and a feverish glitter in his eyes . Murrough 's mouth went dry . There was a commotion outside . Brian 's men were passing nearby , calling Murrough 's name . Momentarily distracted , Molloy turned away from his intended victim and stepped catlike to the opening . Careful to keep his face hidden , he peered outside , trying to determine how near the soldiers were . There might not be another chance . Shaking with terror and very sick to his stomach , Murrough pulled out his knife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Withoutallowing himself to stop to think , he ran full force at Molloy 's unguarded back and put his whole strength behind the blow . It was frightening , how tough that back was ! It was not like cutting into meat at all ; more like trying to sink your blade into a tree trunk . The shock of the blow rocked Murrough and he let loose of the knife and stumbled backward , waiting in terror for the infuriated Molloy to turn around and strike him down . But Molloy did not turn . He stood unmoving for a terribly long time , then made a strange gurgling sound , and sank to his knees , arms upraised , hands clawing at his shoulders.  |p310Murrough  screamed , then , with all the air he could draw into his lungs . " Help ! Help ! I 'm here , I 've got him ! Help ! " And then strong hands were ripping down the flimsy walls of the hut , and Brian 's soldiers poured in upon them . By the time Murrough had repeated his story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deed of an impulsive child committing a rash and dangerous folly to a feat of heroic proportions . In spite of the fact that the dead prince lay on his face , a knife hilt protruding from between his shoulder blades , by Murrough 's account he had been slain in savage hand-tohandcombat by an intrepid young man who knew what he was doing every step of the way . When Murrough was brought before his father  --  accompanied by Molloy 's body on a litter  --  the boy was glowingwith pride and self-importance . Brian 's furious face was like a dash of icy water . " How could you do such an insane thing ! " Brian yelled , his relief roaring out of him in the shape of a thunderous rage . " You could have been killed  --  you should have been killed ! Molloy should have spitted you like a pig and had you for his dinner . Idiot child , do you think war is a game for babies to play ? " The exuberant light faded from Murrough 's eyes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulky edge to his voice . " I was old enough to kill the prince of Desmond , was n't I ? I thought you wanted him dead . " Brian struggled with the urge to put his hands around the boy 's throat and throttle him . The memory of painful , fearful love was wiped away , and he felt something very near to hatredfor being made to suffer such anxiety . And beneath that , a burning , shameful resentment for having been cheated of the revenge he had promised himself for so long . It was not the sword of Brian Born that brought Molloy down . He forced himself to look at Murrough , and remember that this was his son . " Get out of my sight , and stay out of it until we are back at Cashel , " he said in a voice rough with anger.  |p311He  turned to Led . " Tie his hands , if you have to , and keep him within arm 's reach at all times ! " When at last he had a chance to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brian began to let the tension drain out of him . He leaned back against the firmly planted tentpole and stretched his long legs in front of him , crossing them comfortably at the ankle . His hands lay quietly along his thighs , palms downward , and beneath them he could feel the swell of iron muscles . He watched Padraic prepare their evening meal . Outside there was shouting and the singing of men well gone in drink , the sounds of celebration that follow a victory . Brian wondered why the joy of it eluded him . Mahon , he thought , the name crossing his mind as it did so often in unguarded moments . It was a spear of pain . And Murrough 's name might have been added to it , another burden of guilt . The more I have the more I can lose , he thought . The price for my dreams keeps getting higher . " I am raising him to be a king , " Brian said darkly , mostly to himself , " and he is willing to throw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick-tempered , but are those youthful follies alone ? Will he outgrow them when he comes into manhood , or am I wasting all my dreams ? " Padraic , quick to respond to the pain in Brian 's voice , said , " Oh , no , my lord ; Prince Murrough will do you proud some day , I know it . He is young yet , that 's all ; there 's sturdy timberunderneath . You are training him to the kingship and he will not fail you . " Above his beard , Brian 's gray eyes brooded.  |p312The  palace of Kincora rose on the west bank of the Shannon , stone upon stone , timber wedded to timber in an embracemeant to span the centuries . When Brian could make time for it he rode up to supervise the building , suggesting a window here , insisting on a stouter wall there . The builders were surprised at his grasp of their craft , and annoyed at his insistence on perfection in the most minute details . But as the compound grew they began to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a house fit for a provincial king , a splendid citadel , and in the years to come men who did no more than straighten bent iron nails or tamp clay would boast to their grandchildren , " I built Kincora , you know ! " The chambers were to be circular , free of shadowy corners . The grianan was built around an enormous , gnarled apple tree , which had been spared the woodman 's ax and allowed an opening in the roof . Cages for Emer 's songbirds were to be hung from its branches , and the slant of the trunk was invitingto the feet of small climbers . The huge banquet hall was to have two long galleries leadingto the kitchens , so that a steady flow of servants could come and go without having to dodge one another . " No one has done it that way before , my lord ! " the chief builder complained , and was irked to see that his argument only pleased Brian . " That 's all the more reason for doing it , " the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the inmost recesses of the king 's hall , and bright colors blazed everywhere , replacing the gloom of Cashel with the brilliance of Kincora . Painted leather hangings were commissioned for the many separate guest houses and apartments , and Brian 's treasurercomplained to him of the cost.  | " In the spring we 'll demand an additional tribute from the under-kingdoms , if we must , " Brian told him . " I 've spent a fortune already on repairing their roads and giving them militaryprotection ; they should n't object to a little more gold for Kincora . " " But my lord , tributes are always resented . Callachan was a frugal man , and his son after him , and even your dear brother , God rest his soul , spent nowhere near such sums as these . " Brian arched an eyebrow . " All the more incentive for me to do an excellent job as ruler of Munster , would n't you agree ? My people will have such security as they have never known , and the prosperity peace makes possible ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I earn it in full measure  --  twice over . The first rule of kingship should be that a king is always worth his keep . " As Murrough grew , his father 's concept of kingship began to squeeze him like tight clothes . In keeping with his new rank , Brian had not sent his children to the monasteries to be educated , but had brought in the best of the monastic tutors to instruct them at home . The endless lessons pleased scholarlyConor , but Murrough hated them . " Why do I have to stay inside and study all the time ? " he complained to Brian . " I do n't want to be a priest-king , like my uncle , so I do n't need to know Latin and all that . I want to be a warrior-king , like you ! " " I thought like you , once , " Brian told him , " but then I learned that a man must have much knowledge and many skills to rule well , and so I have never ceased my education . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilizations have to do with here and now ? " Murrough argued , thrusting out his lower lip in the small pout that was characteristic of him when he felt abused . " When I am king I 'll have slaves around me who understand mathematics and astronomy and all those boring things ; I wo n't need to know them . " " Every lesson is valuable , if only for the discipline it gives you , " Brian replied . " You are to be more than just my successor , Murrough ; you must be the best king I am able to prod/uce for my people , or my whole concept of succession has no validity . Ca n't you see that ? Besides , I think you will find , as I have , that you will have the opportunity to make use of everything you learn as life goes by . " " I doubt it , " Murrough told him flatly . The boy had spent a lifetime listening to the tales told of his father , and they were all of great deeds , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within him bubbled and steamed ; the peace Brian had brought to Munster did not feed his active imagination . He approached his father with a project . " I want to take a horse and ride out with one of the patrols when they go looking for outlaws and Northmen , " he began enthusiastically . " I would n't get in the way , I 'd just watch , but I could be a lot of help to them , holding horses and so forth , and I could ... " " You 're still a child , Murrough , " Brian interrupted him , with the disconcerting feeling that he was hearing an echo of his own youthful voice . " And you caused enough trouble on your last military venture . I prefer to keep you at home , at least until you have a beard and a little wisdom , so that you cost me no more than you already have . " " What have I cost you ? " " I had to pay a huge fine to the family of Molloy of Desmondbecause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You paid the eric for Donovan 's death , too , under the BrehonLaw , and I do n't remember your complaining about that , " Murrough said sullenly . " I did n't complain in your hearing . But it was costly ; the case for murder with malice is twice that for a simple killing , and in both cases it was certainly with malice . Those men were princes ; their deaths cost me a fortune in cows . " " You would have had to pay for Molloy anyway , " Murroughsaid . " You intended to kill him yourself . Besides , you 're the king ; no man can force you to pay . " Brian scowled . " You have not even tried to learn the Law , have you ? The king must be the foremost respecter of thep315Law , even when it goes against him , or his very land will turn lawless around him . " The rule of compensation is a good one , Murrough . Every man , from the lowest class to the king of kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enters the world , whether it be one pig or five hundred cows . That is his worth and can never be diminished as long as he is within the Law , though he may increase his value through his own efforts . It gives a man a platform of pride on which to plant his feet . " If he is killed or injured outside of a true act of war , then the guilty party must pay . If they can not , their entire tribe is levied upon until compensation to the full amount is furnishedto the family and tribe of the victim . This serves us well , for each tribe controls its own members so as to avoid having to pay large fines for their behavior to some other group . " " Why do n't they just refuse to pay ? " " But that is the very strength of the system ! " Brian exclaimed , struggling to hold on to his diminishing patience . " Surely you have had this explained to you many times -- why do n't you listen ? " Murrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced himself to continue in a reasonable voice . " We obey the ruling of the Brehon Law because the penalty for refusing to do so is expulsion from the tribc permanent outlawry . No tribal lands to till , no share of the cattle or crops , no access to the falidh , no armed tribesmen to protect you . Such an outlaw is one lamb , separated from the flock forever in a world of wolves . " He has no property rights , for the Law will not uphold his right to property , nor compensate him for loss . Any man may kill him without fear of legal redress , for the clothes on his back or the food in his bowl . An outlaw is outside the law . He has no tribe and no protection . His life is usually very poor , very short , and very miserable . " " Thu were an outlaw , once , " Murrough said . " Not really , " Brian told him . " I had not broken the Law of the Brehons , my ears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . I was merely a rebel . " He allowed himself a ghost of a smile . " But I got over it . " Murrough had the kind of mind that could not be led into byways for very long . " I still do n't see why you had to pay for Donovan , or Molloy either , " he said suddenly . " Their deaths were acts of war . " Brian 's voice was cold . " Those were acts of revenge . It is important to see the difference , since we suffer so much from our thirst for vengeance . It is an indulgence , Murrough , nothing more noble than that . I could afford it , but you could not  --  you were only a child , and you were rash and careless with your valuable life . " " I will repay you for Molloy 's eric ! " Murrough exclaimed angrily . " I will pay you for everything you 've ever done for me ! I would n't want to be in debt to a man who held it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Why do I bother ? Brian thought . He went to stand at the window , gazing out over the misty plain . And he saw his dream there , spread before him , bigger than the pettiness of daily living . I love this land , he reminded himself . What I do , I do for IrelandThe gray rocks of it , the ribs and spine that have been here since the Creation . Over there , where it blurs into the trees , there is a sweet curve to it that makes my heart ache the way Deirdre 's smile does . I could stand here for hours and feast my eyes on it . It is almost as if I could stretch out my palm , so , and feel it rounding against my flesh . In that copse of autumn-brown trees I might fancy I could see Fiona .. . He shook his head and wiped his hand across his eyes . There was no one in the trees . If I were to ride down to the river and sit on the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay , but also the richness and rebirth . An animal falls into the river and dies and its bones are washed clean , its mortal part carried away and returned to the whole mass of existence . It becomes part of the land again . When I am old and tired I will sink into the soil , too , and dissolve into the earth and be one with it . When I am but a memory it will stillp317be here , and a thousand years from now men may stand where I do and see what I saw , feel what I felt , and we will all be part of the same thing . Irishmen , with a throat-aching love in them for the hills and the valleysand the singing of the water . Men whose bones will be formed from the crops they grow in the soil to which my body shall return . Brian snorted and turned away from the window . I make a lot of fancy speeches in my head to impress myself , he thought . I am a pretentious bastard . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before he returned to the problems of the day he spared it one more look of lust and love . " Erin , " he said aloud , softly . " Erin . " A tender smile lighted his eyes and spread , slowly , to curve his lips . Tara , hill of kings . And the green plain beyond it , within sight of the jumble of royal buildings and the sacred mounds where dead kings and unredeemed hostages slept together in the dark earth . Nothing disturbed the brooding peace of Tara  --  not the ceaseless traffic on the network of roads leading to it , nor the clash of battle on the sunlit plain . It was the heart of Ireland . And it was here in the year 980 that Malachi Mor , ruler of Meath , had at last forced the decisive confrontation he sought with the Dublin Norsemen . The battle over , the victory won , the jubilant young king was celebrating with his officers . Goblets and flagons were overflowing and the bonfires were piled lavishly high . Malachi was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he called to a newcomer just arriving from the battlefield , his splintered shield and bloody arm tes/timony to his recent efforts . " Are the dead from Dublin identifiedyet ? " Rone widened his eyes . " As soon ask me if the leaves on the trees are numbered ! There are hundreds of them out there . " Malachi was stretched full length on the ground , propped on one elbow . Wiry , ruddy , with narrow shoulders and the beginnings of a pot belly , his was not a king-like figure . But an aura of energy emanated from him , quivering the very air he breathed . To be in Malachi 's vicinity was to be aware of life , of mirth and merriment bubbling close to the surface . When his blue eyes danced and his chuckle broke into hearty laughter , as it usually did , he became the center of any group , warming them like a good fire . Malachi the Great they called him , with love and affection . Malachi the Victor , today . Malachi Mor , successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conqueror of the Dublin Norse . He grinned and sat up , sloshing his mead . " I do n't want them all named , you great dolt ; just see if old Olaf the Shoe is among them , will you ? He 's the one I 'm after . " " I can tell you now , my lord , he 's not , " a glowering dark Celt stepped forward to report . " It seems he did n't come up to stand against you after all ; the coward sent his son instead , and he 's safe behind walls at Dublin , enjoying that gorgeous wife of his . " Malachi 's grin widened . " Ah , yes , Maelmordha 's sister . Well , we 'll be going on to Dublin anyway to collect hostages , so perhaps we should take a look at the lady and see if she lives up to the songs sung about her , eh ? I hear she 's a spiritedgirl , and I do like a spirited girl ! " He glanced at the men around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and laughed . The news reached Dublin before the setting of the sun . Olaf Cuaran sat impassive in the hall , listening to his runners as they told their tale of tragedy . He was in full Norse armor , but a gold crucifix gleamed at his throat and a Christianp319priest stood at his elbow , hands clasped in an attitude of prayer . The torches in their holders flared and smoked , S throwing fantastic patterns against the walls . " You say my son Ranall is slain ? " Olaf asked in a hoarse whisper . The runners bowed their heads . " He is . " " Killed ... at Tara ? By the new Ard Ri ? " " Yes , my lord . " Olaf Cuaran looked past them to the doorway and the courtyard , and thought of the land that lay beyond . " He was my first son , " he said at length , in a voice erased by grief . " My oldest  --  my vildng , I called him . Ranall . " He roused himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pray for him , Father ? " he asked the priest . " Of course ; a Mass will be said at sunrise for the repose of his soul . " Two Norse chieftains in the hall exchanged glances . " Ranall died a warrior . Odin will claim him ! " one hissed to the other . The second shrugged . " There will be a war for his spirit , then . Since the king 's converted to the White Christ he 's consignedall our souls to the Christian heaven . " " But there 's no fighting there ! No drinking , no sleeping with women ... it 's an abominable place ! Just because Olaf chooses it , that 's no reason the rest of us must be imprisoned there . " " Well , then , I suggest we get out of here quietly and be on board our ships before Malachi reaches the gates of Dublin . At least if we die in northern waters on a viking expedition we can anticipate a ride with the Valkyries instead of a wooden box buried beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod and jerked his belt tight . " Let 's go , " he said . The man who stood at her chamber door was old . His skin sagged on his bones like wrinkled leather bags , empty of riches . Gormlaith did not even bother to dismiss her maid  --  itp320had been a long time since anything had passed between her and Olaf that required privacy . " What is it now ? " she asked him , irritable because he had interrupted her reading . " I thought you might like to know I 've made my decision . " Gormlaith showed him an extravagant yawn . " I did n't know you had one to make . " She stretched out her arm and indicated to the maid that she wished more scented oil rubbed onto it . " Malachi Mor is advancing on Dublin , Gormlaith . He will be here by tomorrow . " " I told you you should make more of an effort to establish friendly relations with him . " " He does n't want my friendship ; he wants control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spent our strength in the effort to hold on to Northumbria , and he 's moving in to pick our bones . " " You Northmen are fine ones to talk about predators ! " Gormlaith laughed at him . " I see you as an old wolf , lying on the ground with your feet in the air , begging mercy of a young one . " Olaf 's voice tightened . " I wo n't beg mercy , and I wo n't stay here and be his pawn . My plans are already made , wife . I am going to Iona to enter the monastery there , if they 'll have me . " Gormlaith whirled around on her cushioned stool and stared at him . " You 're what ? " " I 'm going to answer the call of Christ . I 've fought it too long already , and my son 's death is my punishment . I 'm going to spend the rest of my days in prayer and peace . " Gormlaith roared out a laugh as full-bellied as a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shouted to her maid , a Cornish slave from one of Olaf 's more successful viking raids . " The terrible warrior is going to be a gentle monk ! It 's too funny ; I ca n't quite comprehend it . Are you having a jest with me , Olaf ? " " No jest , I assure you . I 've had enough turbulence for four lifetimes ; I long for the solitude of the holy isle . "  | " And what of your sons your responsibilities ? " " Ranall is dead . Malachi killed him at Tara . Harold goes his own way . As for Gluniarand , I suppose he will satisfy his belly and his loins by the easiest way , as he always has , even if that means licking the Irish hand . I expect no better of that one . " " And me ? And my son ? " There was a ghost of a smile on Olaf 's lips . " Do you want to come with me and request admission to a nunnery ? " Gormlaith gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , woman , what you do with your life from now on is up to you . Sitric is a likely lad , but not quite a man yet , no matter what he thinks . You might send him to a noble house ... " Gormlaith began to realize that Olaf was really serious . Incredulous , she stood to face him , feeling her temper kindle . " Are you trying to tell me you mean to abandon us ? You would leave your wife and child helpless here , with an army marching on our gates ? " She was splendid in her anger , her lips curled in contempt and her emerald eyes flashing . But Olaf was not moved . I will never look on that face again , he thought with vast relief . I will pray every day at the shrine of some cool and pallid Madonna , and count my blessings . " You slander yourself , Gormlaith , " he told her . " You are the least helpless of women , and if you confront Malachi I worry more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You clay-eater ! " Gormlaith screamed at him , grabbing the nearest jar of unguent and hurling it at him . " You maggot-heap ! You stinking vermin ! May you taste hair in your mouth and have sand in your eyes every day for the rest of your life ! " With what remained of his warrior 's reflexes , Olaf Cuaran side-stepped the barrage of objects she was throwing at him . One heavy gold bracelet struck his shoulder and fell with a clatter to the floor , and he bent to pick it up . " Farewell , Gormlaith , " he told her , speaking calmly beneath the rising volume of her yelling . " I 'll present this as an offering to the monks of Iona in your name , and buy a prayerp322for your soul with it . " He turned away . " Or for the soul of the next man to fall into your power , " he added under his breath . Deirdre had a cough . In the beginning it did not seem serious , just the occasional hacking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The move to Kincora had overtired her , the royal physician said , and when she was rested and the spring came the cough would disappear . But spring came and the cough remained ; it began to sound as if it came from someplace very deep within her . She would be seized with it during meals and turn away , her eyes begging forgiveness , to strive without success to empty the phlegm from her lungs into a basin held by a solicitous servant . Afterward , when she tried to draw a deep breath there was a rattling in her chest . The physician gave her nostrums and syrups but the cough overrode them . " All those medicines taste so bad , Brian , " Deirdre objected fretfully . " I ca n't believe they do me any good when they are so vile ; they only make me want to vomit and then I feel worse . " " Take the medicine anyway , " he urged . In the long days of summer , when fresh food and the sweet produce of Thomond plumped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow thinner . She picked at her food . She had never been a hearty eater , as easily thrown off her feed as a nervous horse , but now she ate almost nothing . The skin of her hands became so white and translucent the bones could be seen starkly beneath . Brian railed at the physician . " You are on ollamh , your knowledge is supposed to be the most complete in your pro/fession , and yet the queen is wasting away before our eyes . Do something , man ! " " I 'm doing everything I know , my lord , " the physician protested . " Well , it is n't enough ! I will have a new and better practitionerof your skills in Kincora by harvest time , I promise you that ! " Brian went to the priests , he consulted with the herbalists himself , he sent Padraic to make sumptuous offers to any physicianwho could come to Kincora with a cure for Deirdre . And daily the enemy gained ground . The king began to spend time on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a softness , a gentle browning of leaves , and the calls of the birds going south . Formations of geese moved through the sky , their cries hauntingand full of leave-taking . Brian felt a dread of the first frost that he had never known before . " Everything 's dying , " he said to Padraic . " It 's autumn , my lord ; there will be rebirth in the spring , and Resurrection at Easter . " Brian found that he could not clearly visualize the spring . So many magical returns of that season had he lived through , and yet his memory of it was blurred , unreal . He knew there would be tender green leaves and a thousand starry flowers within arm 's reach , and the wind would be warm and sweet , but somehow he did not really believe it anymore . There was a vast cold chasm between him and spring ; he feared winter with the old pagan dread , and was afraid of its permanence . He tried to find more time to spend with Deirdre . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state made its insatiabledemands on him . There was no hour that did not require his personal attention , no act that could be completed properlywithout his supervision . He felt frustrated by circumstancethat conspired to keep him from her side , and at the same time relieved that he had no long hours to spend with her , listening to her breathing . She , whom he had never been able to grasp totally , was moving away from him on an invis/ible tide , and the only sign it gave was the labored drawing of her breath . Everyone knew she was dying . There was color in her face where no color had been before a red , hectic stain below the cheekbones , unhealthy against the pallid skin . Her breath was bitter , and her eyes burned dryly with fever . She tried to make a joke of it , a small , Deirdre-sized joke . " I wo n't need to put berry juice on my cheeks now , my lord , " she said to Brian , " nor those stinging drops in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort ! " " You were always beautiful without that , " he told her , touching her hot face with the back of his hand . She no longer shrank away from his touch , even in the invisible way within herself . Her body was safe from the hungers of his , protected by the onset of its own disintegration . No desire was left in him , only a terrible sadness that burned in his belly like unshed tears . When she would no longer take food they found the only way to get any nourishment into her was to wrap her in warm robes and place her on Brian 's lap . He would share his goblet with her , a sip at a time . He never thought that the killer might move from her lips to his ; she was the one who was going away , and he would be left behind . When she had taken an amount far too small to sustain life she would give a little sigh and her head would droop onto his shoulder . " One more swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she only smiled , and that hurt him worse than the sound of her coughing . " Maybe later , " she promised . It became a desperate race , unnamed but recognized by everyone at Kincora , to keep her alive until spring . " If she can see the geese return she will live , " the old women prophesied . " The disease will not take her after the last frost , " someone else said . But the winter was their enemy now . It invaded the valleys with glittering fingers ; its cold breath , whistled through the hills . An unusually harsh , long winter . The insects burrowedp325deep into the soil and beneath the bark of trees , and the small animals slept on in their sleep that is the brother to death . Spring became a fable , promised but not delivered . The days at last began to grow longer , though the sun was without warmth and the light that filtered through the windowswas sickly and yellow . They all told themselves that Deirdre looked stronger , but when Brian held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit only . In his heart she had already died , and the days spent with her fading shell were agonizing . And then one evening there was a new scent in the air , a whiff of warming earth and greening grass , and the next day the sunrise was vibrant with life and the birds were singing . The children burst from the palace , unable to bear a moment longer within walls . " Take me outside too , my lord , " Deirdre asked . " Please . The little . tree beyond my chamber window looks as if it has buds on it and I would give anything to see them ! " Her maid wrapped her in a robe of wool dyed a rich royal purple , and Brian saw the color reflected in her eyes . She smiled at him . " Have I become so very old and ugly my lord ? " " No , truly . I was just noticing your eyes  --  they 're like amethyststoday . " " Did I ever tell you I do n't like amethysts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People always give them to me for some reason , but I 've never really cared for them . " She paused to cough and he was concerned for her , but she smiled and went on . " What I really love is massive gold jewelry  --  you know the kind ?  --  barbaric ! Like that collar you brought back from limerick . Fithir said it was too heavy for me , and my maid put it at the bottom of my jewel chest and then always took out other things instead . But I liked it best . " " I never knew that . I thought you did n't wear it because "  --  he hesitated , then found he could say the words after all . Because she was dying something had changed and at last they could speak to one another  --  " because it was a gift from me. "  |p326Had  the fever not burned all moisture from her there would have been tears in her eyes . " Ah , Brian ! That was the very reason I loved it most ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder as he carried her out into the morning . The fresh air seemed to do her good , although the physicianfussed and Brian took her back in quickly lest she be chilled . Throughout the day she coughed less than she had in months , and at dinner she ate a tiny bit of fish and a quarter of a cutting of a honeycomb . But as the shadows stretched towardevening her small vitality seemed to drain away , and at last she asked Brian to carry her to her chamber . It was always Brian she asked for now . The distance from the banquet hall to the bedchambers was not long , but because of Deirdre it was kept well-lit . Brian would allow no shadows at Kincora . As he walked with his wife in his arms , he heard her soft voice against his chest . " Why so many lamps , my lord ? Is n't that wasteful ? " He smiled down at the top of her head . " Lamps give a clearer light than torches . I 'm the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I want as many as will give you comfort . " She shifted delicately in his arms . He could barely hear her voice . " But it really is n't necessary , " she said very faintly . " I 'm not at all afraid of the dark . " When he reached the door of their chamber , Brian Boru was alone . " This place gets less like a pal ce and more like a garrison every day , " Liam complained , kicking at a hound that had grown too bold and tried to snatch food from the table . " Thep327bread 's not fit to eat , the chambers are filthy , and I swear there are weeds starting to grow through the walls ! " " Do n't complain to me , " Conaing told him . " Well , I ca n't complain to the king about it ! " The hound grew more insistent , and Conaing whirled around on his stool and slapped the dog 's drooling jaws . " Why not , wo n't he see you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see anybody , he just does n't pay any attention . Ever since she died , talking to Brian has been like talking to a rock . You recall that Malachi replaced Olaf Cuaran with that vicious son of his , Gluniarand  --  why , I ca n't imagine  --  and Brian was very concerned at the time over the fact that Malachi was going to leave a Norseman with a reputationfor cruelty in charge of Dublin . Messengers came yesterdaywhen you were out with the patrol ; they had ridden hard to bring the news of Olaf Cuaran 's death on Iona , and to tell of a rumor that Malachi intended to wed the Norseman'sIrish widow . " All of those affairs would have been of great interest to the Brian we have always known and followed , and yet the king did n't even have any questions for them . He halfway listened , and then he thanked them in a vague sort of way as if they had brought no more news than a comment on the weather . If rumors of his state of mind should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's a shame the lady Fithir chose to remain at Cashel ; the king always seemed to think highly of her . " " Brian needs something more than a near-sister right now , " Liam remarked . A tall man in a hooded robe of monks ' cloth leaned forward to enter the conversation . " You warriors  --  you think a woman is the answer to everything , do n't you ? " " A woman may not be the answer , Celechair , " Liam told him , " but it 's been my experience that women always have an answer . But I suppose you would n't know about that , being an abbot . " He gave Celechair a broad wink which the other man ignored . " Clerics have feelings like everybody else , Liam . Anchoritesp328may take to the celibate life , and the bishop of Rome may like to think that all the clergy does likewise , but you know as well as I do that the Church in Ireland has overlooked more than one married priest , and many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Corc grinned . " And what about you , Celechair ? " " I keep my private life private . Unlike some . " The abbot sniffed . Laoghaire the Red moved down the table to get closer to the discussion . " You 're talking about women ? " he asked with a gleam in his eye . " Wait and I 'll go and get young Murrough ; that is his favorite topic these days , since his beard grew . " " We 're talking about the king , " Conaing said coolly . " Oh . That 's another problem . " " Yes , and one that must be solved soon , or all Munster will suffer . " Padraic , who sat throughout the meal with his eyes downcastand his hands on his food , slipped quietly from his stool and left the hall . He found Brian sitting on a stone outcropping overlooking the river , his harp lying forgotten in his lap . The gray eyes glanced without interest in Padraic 's direction and looked away again . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talk in the hall , my lord ... " " There is always talk in the hall . " " Your men are worried about you . " " It 's not necessary . " Brian 's fingers touched the strings carelessly and the little harp made a strange , discordant sound . Padraic tried again . " They say the year of your grief has ended , my lord , and they would be relieved to see you rouse yourself from it and consider some of our problems  --  call a meeting of your council , perhaps . " Brian would not look at him . " What problems ? " " Our position in relation to the other provinces , for one . You 've brought such prosperity to Munster that both the el/ders and the army fear invasion . Leinster has always been inimicalto us , and then there 's Meath ... Some say that now that Malachi is Ard Ri , he may undertake to enrich his own home province at the expense of others . " Brian allowed himself a small sigh . The never-ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seen from the remote viewpoint of a height above the river , it was all like the scurrying of ants in tall grass . What differencewould it make in a hundred years ? Everyone would be dead , the dreams forgotten . Or not dead  --  otherwise  --  otherwhere ... He began speaking in a faraway voice . " You know , Padraic  --  the Druids believed that nothing was ever lost , that every raindrop and rose petal contained its own tiny spark of immortality , and would continue without end in some spiral of existence . They did not believe in death , those practitioners of the Old Religion ; they merely believed in a change of condition . " The priests tell me Deirdre is at peace with Christ , and yet I find greater comfort in the belief of the Druids . It would hurt less if I knew her tender spirit continued in the world , even if it 's a world I can not see . I want to think that she 's just over the horizon  --  or in another room  --  anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really got to know her , Padraic ; I always thought there would be time for us in the future , when I had made everything else right . But there is no future if Deirdre is dead . " " If she is dead ? " " To go to heaven , out of this world altogether , one must die . But in the Old Religion there was no such thing as death , merely a passage into another existence , hidden from us by the thinnest of walls . It was believed that it was possible to pass back and forth between those worlds under certain circumstances . The ancient priests believed they could communicate with those in other life forms ; they could speak to their gods , and bring messages to the living from the not-living . " They did not fear death because it was not an insurmountablebarrier to them , and they were somehow attunedp330to a larger scale of existence than we know today . But we have lost that , over the centuries ... " " Of course we have , my lord ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it ? " Brian asked . His face was haggard , his eyes were glowing coals sunk deep in their sockets . " Or is the blasphemythe fact that we have become less godlike and more mortal ? " I 've tried to find comfort in the Church 's teachings , Padraic , for I am a Christian and I believe in the way of the Lord . But it seems that I believe in something more , as well , and I no longer assume that one is the negation of the other . I suspect the forbidden religions had part of a secret we have lost , and as long as we refuse to admit its existence we are like blind men , shut off forever from the reality of our world . " Like the Druids of old , I do not want to believe in death . But ah , Padraic ! I find I no longer believe in life , either ! " Malachi felt as nervous as a young lad about to meet his sweetheart in some hidden glade . He walked with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At his heels a page trotted , carrying a whole basketful of jewelry , and as Malachi neared her door he took a quick mental inventory of his offerings . Too small , too common ! Beside her brilliant eyes and flaminghair they would pale into nothingness . She would laugh at his gifts and throw them in his face . But it was too late to exchangethem , for her maidservant stood at the entrance , smilingand bowing them into the room . " Malachi Mor , Ard Ri of all Ireland , king of all the kings ! " the page announced in a squeaky treble . Gormlaith reclined on a padded bench , her body propped against velvet cushions and swathed in glossy furs . But nothingcould hide the beauty of the woman . Looking at her , Malachirealized that her pose was carefully arranged for maximum impact , a studied selection of line and curve and texture intended to nail his attention and simmer his blood . But he did not resent it.  |p331How  could you resent a woman who was , so totally , Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , extending one jeweledhand to him . Gormlaith did not rise , even for the High King . It was a statement of her own power . He took the box of jewelry from its bearer and dismissed the boy with a curt nod . The maidservant melted away as well , bowing low as she backed from the chamber , and Malachiwaited through an eternity until they were gone . Then he strode to the bench in one great step and reached for the woman who lay there , smiling lazily up at him . How fragrant her flesh was ! How cleverly constructed this gown , that somehow fell apart at the throat as soon as his fingerstouched it and let her heavy breasts spring free ! There were words he had meant to say , rehearsed speeches to impressher , but she offered herself to him so totally and with such a lack of restraint that any formalities seemed ludicrous . There was nothing to do but touch , taste , feel , rub , thrust .. . Gormlaith squirmed away from him and sat up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a handsome man , unfortunately , but he was a beautifully lustful one ! The hot light in his eyes warmed her from her erect nipples to the aching valley between her thighs , and the smile she gave him in return withheld nothing . Nevertheless , she planted one square white hand against his heaving chest and stiffened her arm between them . " You 've waited so long , my lord  --  surely you can control yourself for a few moments more ? " He read her right . This was a lady who demanded the loss of all control ; a dangerous thing in a woman , but what a joy it would be to surrender to it ! " Gormlaith ! " he cried , grabbing for her . The warmth was gone from her voice in the blinking of an eye  --  a cold emerald eye , that stared at him imperiously as if he were some impudent baggage boy taking liberties with the nobleman 's wife . " Wait , I said ! " Gormlaith demanded . She put all the power at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it iron , lashing him with it , and watching intently top332judge the courage of his response . Olaf Cuaran , that crumbingold man , would have backed away and stood blinking at her like some great fish out of water . Malachi did not back away , nor did he blink . He held himselfabsolutely still , trying to measure her as she measured him . He was aware of the erection thrusting against his tunic , a foolish lance forward-tilted for an engagement that might never take place . He would hate her if she looked down at it , but she did not . Their locked eyes held . " Why wait , lady ? " he said at last , controlling his breathing with difficulty . If she would deny him , he would deny her . Malachi had played games before . " Why not ? Is n't fruit sweeter if you have to climb a tall tree to pick it ? " She was teasing him then , cat-and-mouse . But I am no mouse , lady , he thought , and no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her own . " Sometimes the fruit is n't worth the climb , Gormlaith . " Her eyes sparkled . " How can you know unless you taste it ? Unless you hold it in your mouth . and run your tongue over it ... and let its juices slide down your throat ... ? " Malachi balled his fists , the nails biting into his palms , but his voice was level and calm . " It seems you mean to deny me a taste , Gormlaith  --  is that correct ? Have you chosen to remember that you are a widow , still in mourning ? " She stuck out her pointed red tongue at him . " Ha ! You think I mourn a slack-loined old man who ran off and left me to face the conqueror alone ? " Her voice caressed the word conqueror , and in spite of himself Malachi looked again at her naked breasts , and the sheen of sweat glossing them . She watched the direction of his eyes . " They would taste salty now ; it 's very warm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a golden purr . Something twitched in his jaw , a tiny muscle into which he poured all the concentrated tension of his body . " You invited me here , lady . Your messenger brought word that you were ready to discuss my proposal of marriage , and I came in good faith . Your welcome certainly gave me no reason to suspectp333that you intended to reject me ! But now you tell me to wait , as you have told me to wait again and again these past weeks . " I 'm tired of waiting , Gormlaith , and there are other mattersthat demand my attention . Either your brother has sent his permission for the marriage or not ; I must know today . " " Oh , now , Malachi , do n't be angry ! I was merely having a little fun with you , did n't you know that ? A little harmless amusement to add spice to our relationship . " She drew her gown closed demurely , looking up at him through her long lashes , and patted the seat beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive me . I have good news . " He sat down too eagerly , and knew at once it was a mistakewhen he saw the minute flicker of contempt in her eyes , but it could not be undone . Every gesture , every syllable must be weighed with this woman ! Perhaps that was what made her so exciting ; surely old Olaf had been as helpless to deal with her as a baby with a lion . But he knew he could handle her . " News from Leinster ? " he asked . " Yes , my brother Maelmordha has consented to the match , in return for your support of him in his struggle for supremacyover the entire province , and five thousand men to stand with him if he is invaded . " " Invaded ? By whom ? " Gormlaith shrugged , and her breasts pulled free of their flimsy covering once more . " Every prince has enemies , and my brother has more than most , I fear . That 's why he has to be so careful with his ... assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bridc dealing with the lady herself , " Malachi commented . " It 's rather like makingyour arrangements with the horse instead of the horse dealer . " Gormlaith laid her hand on his thigh and the fingers began a slow walk upward , pushing the edge of his tunic ahead of them . " You 'll be getting a hot-blooded mare , my lord , " she smiled at him , " sound of wind and limb and with all her teeth intact . " The flaming hair whipped past his face and droppedp334to his lap , and he felt her mouth on the inner surface of his thigh , her teeth nibbling . I am making a terrible mistake , Malachi thought . He closed his eyes . I do n't care . A small brown woman came to the gates of Kincora , accompanied by a tall maiden well-concealed in a hooded cloak . " We have heard that the king is far gone in grief , " the brown woman began to explain to the guard . " I am a skilled herbalist , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or one of the line of Cennedi ? " the guard interrupted her , stepping forward abruptly and trying to peer into the tall girl 's face . " What do you mean ? This is my daughter ! " Fiona exclaimed , putting herself squarely between them . " All right , all right , but you 're bringing her to Kincora to live , are n't you ? " Fiona bristled . " And why should I ? " " Why , we have had a standing order from the king that we are to take in all the blood descendants of Cennedi ; he wants to see that they are properly educated and provided for . His older brothers had sired a sizable brood among them before they died , and most of them have come to Kincora since it was completed . Lachtna 's son Celechair is here right now  --  the abbot of Terryglass , he is now . And this girl has a look about her ... " Fiona dodged in front of him , determined to block his view . With one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , she 's not anyone but my own child , and no one else has any claim on her ! She and I go our own way and trouble no one ; it 's just that I am ... obligated ... to try to aid the king when he needs me , in what ways I can , and ... " " The king is n't seeing anyone , " the guard said firmly . " And if he were , it would n't be some faded woods-woman . If you want to leave the lass here , though , I 'll look after her myself , and ... " " You misunderstand me , " Fiona said in a harsh voice . Shep335grabbed the girl 's wrist , and the two started back down the road together , leaving the guard staring after them . When she reached the sheltering woods , Fiona stopped to look back . The stone and timber walls rose in symmetrical beauty , a stout defense against sword and spear . But there were other dangers that could cut a man down and destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There it was ; a faint shimmer of tension , white-gray , the aura emanatingfrom the place where Brian was . The halo of grief ; leaden , depressing . With one hand she reached up slowly and felt her cheek and the skin of her face ... " some faded woods-woman " .. . Her fingertips touched the rayed wrinkles at the corners of her eyes , then drew forward a long strand of hair so that she could see it clearly . The rich brown was frosted with white . " Do men only grow , " she said , more to herself than the waiting girl , " while women grow old ? " There was a rumble of thunder over the mountains . Her daughter began to walk again , hurrying deeper into the woods , and Fiona followed her as the first raindrops spattered on the friendly leaves . Runners came up from the south , breathless with the excitement of bad news . " Gillapatrick of Ossory has invaded Munster , raided the cattle herds near the border , and stolen everything of value that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly Brian would immediately launch an attack of reprisal ; volunteers came scurrying up the roads with packs on their backs , anxious to be able to tell their kinfolk , " We marched with Brian Boru ! " Only Brian remained uninterested . He discussed countermeasureswith his officers in a desultory fashion , half listening , his gaze elsewhere . The kingdom he had fought to win was invaded , raped , and he could not make himself care . He saw the bafflement in their faces as they tried unsuccessfully to enmeshhim in their plans . " My lord , of course you must lead us ! " Leti argued . " It'sp336unthinkable that you stay at Kincora while your army attacks Leinster ! " " You can do it without me . I trained you , all of you ; you know what to do . " " But it would n't be the same ! " " Why not ? " Brian 's voice was thin . " What difference is one man , more or less ? " " I do n't believe I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God help us ! " came the reply . But Brian was no longer attempting to carry on dialogues with God . The Ear into which he had poured his pleadings had been deaf , no prayer was answered , no help given . Deirdrelay in her tomb . Mahon .. . He spent most of his time outside the compound . All of his love and creativity had gone into the design of Kincora , and the sight of it had become excruciatingly painful . The only thing that hurt more was the thought of leaving it . Every torchholder and candle niche was a dig in the gut ; the sweepingviews from the galleries , the wealth of carved stone and polished yew , even the light and the spaciousness were a constantreproof , a reminder of the long final darkness . They did not know how much I loved them . I could have spent more time with Deirdre ; I could have tried harder to understand . Did Mahon know ? He thought I was his enemy . I thought he was a fool . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of the familiar , loved face , he could only picture the darkness of the grave . The unacceptable wall , the final separation . He strove within himself to force his way through that dark veil that separated the living from the notliving , and daily he grew more comfortable with his growing isolation . There was one way of dealing with pain that he had never before explored . Surrender .. . He stood on his hilltop , eyes caressing the reedy silver loops of the Shannon , and said the word to himself . The once unacceptableword : geilleadh  --  surrender . Open to it , fight nop337more . Give yourself completely to the melancholy and let it carry you away , into that dream world beyond . Surrender . Give up . The pearled air of Ireland moved about him , mist-soft , comforting . The piping sweetness of a waterbird 's cry came up to him from the river . The greens of the landscape flowed into his eyes , into his brain , into his soul . Grasping trees , springing grass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the river . Going on without him . He was peripherally conscious of the community of Kincora at a distance ; felt without thinking the pressure of its responsibilities . Family , children , foster children , cousins , friends , councilors , ollamhs , clergy , officers , artisans , musicians , brehons , warriors , servants . Each of them requiring some part of his energy , none of them able to help him . Behind him , the trees moved , clasping their branches together in the gentle breeze like supplicating hands . They drew their energy from the earth and poured it into the very air , sending it out , directing it .. . As the small brown woman who stood concealed within the heart of the woods directed them . Her eyes on the tall man barely visible through the screen of leaves , her hands forming the ancient signs , she poured her life and all the life at her command outward , toward the man who carried the future of Ireland on his shoulders . He stood erect , at last beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God or hope of heaven . Purgatory , he thought idly , not caring . And I am all alone . I have no one but myself . But myself . In the silence he heard the blood roaring in his ears . He felt the weight of his body pressing downward through strongmuscledlegs and broad-planted feet , into the earth . I have myself . He drew one slow , deep breath , careful not to shatter the bubble expanding within his chest . The awareness of life , in/sistent , demanding , not to be denied , grew in him and sang in his veins . I am alive . He looked at the beloved land and it was still there , as it had always been . Just as beautiful , just as enduring . Death was absorbed into it and given back as life . Death had no power over the land . It has no more power over me than I give it , he thought . I told Padraic I do not want to believe in death , and I have never believed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? He threw back his head and looked at the endless depths of the blue sky above him , the sun gilding the edges of a little billow of clouds blown gently inland from the sea . " Do You hear me ? " he cried , raising his fists above his head . " I will surrender to no one ; I will not let myself be destroyedby shadows in my own mind ! " He hurled his defiance at the empty spaces above him and knew , with absolute certainty , that Something heard ... and was pleased . The army of Munster swept across the land , following Brian Boru . The red-and-gold banner of the three raging lions whipped in the wind of their passing . They splashed through streams , singing , and broke through the stands of alderas they would break through the ranks of an enemy . They flowed over the gentle hills , hot with purpose , shouting their war cries , Boru 's men on the move again . Hearing the thunder of their coming , long-eared coneys hid in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding in the oak forests . But there was no hiding place for the men of Ossory , only a hasty retreat to their tuathsp339on the banks of the Nore river . Brian 's men came after them , pausing for neither rest nor food , eating oat bread and waysideberries as they marched , a forest of spears rising from their shoulders , chanting . The countryfolk cowered in their cottages of mud and timberand wickerwork , shielded only by a coat of lime wash from the hard eyes of the warrior of Munster . But , as always , there were some who darted out , eager to give news of Gillapatrick for a piece of silver or a fine wool bratt . Besieged and hard-pressed , the prince of Ossory sent three messengers riding north with a desperate plea to Maelmordha of Leinster , in his stronghold near Naas . " Tell Maelmordha that we have been attacked without provocation by a gang of bloodthirsty Munstermen , " Gillapatrick instructed them . " Explain about that vile trick when Boru lured my best men into a bog and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drown  --  that will show what kind of a dog he is ! And be certain the prince understands that my people are being gathered and taken to Munster as hostages . Beg him to send me more warriors , and arms ! " As night fell , the messengers led their horses , hoofwrapped , a safe distance from the ruin of Gillapatrick 's hall , where sporadic fighting was still taking place , then mounted and raced northward . Morning found them in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains . They had ridden past deep peat ridges and bogs starred with bog cotton , and sheep grazing on lonely moors had lifted their heads to watch them gallop by in the moonlight . They kicked and switched their horses along winding mountain trails , oblivious to the wild beauty of foaming stream and lacy waterfalls . Their memories still contained the picture of the Munstermenrunning up the hill toward Gillapatrick 's stockade , brandishing axes as skillfully as Northmen and screaming threats . When they looked at one another they saw , mirrored in their comrade 's eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sweating stallion , a red silk mantle blowing back from his shoulders , his tireless sword arm rising and falling.  |p340They  reached Naas at last , exhausted , horse-sore , and Maelmordha ordered boiled eels and red wine for them while he listened to their story . Then he called for fresh horses to be brought them . " The Cualann road lies a few miles from here , leading straight to Tara . The Ard Ri is my near-brother now , and my problems should be his . You have come such a long way so bravely , I charge you go this little additional distance to Malachi , who has convened his council there . Greet him in my name , and tell him that I request he put a body of men in the field against this Brian Boru , who has criminally invaded Leinster . " When they had ridden away he returned to his hall and commented to the throng of nobles and hem-hangers who filled it , " I never believe in spending my own men unless it will benefit me directly . Gillapatrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ri defend him . " " You do n't intend to fight Boru ? " someone asked . Maelmordha gnawed his underlip and thought of the tales he had heard in recent years . " Not if I can help it , " he replied . " After all , he has n't done anything to me . " The Ossorymen rode on , following the road blindly and unaware when the aspect of the land changed . It was only when the road itself began to be crowded with carts and horses that they knew they were on the slighe , the main highwayfor wheeled vehicles . They became part of the- general crush of carts and chariots jostling one another for right of way as they approached the official seat of the Ard Ri . The chariot whirled past them , driven by a young noble in a brilliantly colored and elaborately pleated linen tunic . He reined in his pair of frothing horses to stare at them curiously , then cracked his whip and dashed away , wheeling the horses too sharply , so that the chariot rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Watch out ! " and " Look where you 're going , you young fool ! " The slighe flowed into the ramut , the king 's avenue . There was no rock or rut in it where a tired horse might stumble ,  |p341for  the ramut was kept immaculately clean by the people of the king 's own tribe , using the three ritual cleansings : by brushwood , by water , and by weeds . The road stretched straight before them now , a broad ribbon gently rising to the green and distant ridge , the sacred hill , hub of the Five Roads of Ireland . Tara . Timbered halls still stood within the seven duns , the ringfortsbuilt beyond memory 's reach , but their wood was ash gray and fragile with age . Before the Miodhchuarta , the huge royal banqueting hall , the Ard Ri 's flag hung limp in the soft air . Guards wearing swords and holding shields of bronze stood at each of the fourteen doorways of the enormous building , and a constant flow of people moved in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various musicians playing throughout the area . If the Ossorymen had expected to be ushered into the presence of Malachi Mor himself , they were mistaken . They were taken to a separate round chamber , bustling with lawyers and courtiers , but the Ard Ri was not there . In his place , not actuallysitting on his High Seat but standing very close to it , rather leaning against it , was a woman . And such a woman ! Gormlaith straightened and lifted her chin , so that she could look down her nose at them . " I 'm told you have a messagefrom my brother , Prince Maelmordha of Leinster ? " They exchanged glances . The leader of the trio sputtered through several throat clearings before managing to say , " We were instructed to report directly to the Ard Ri , my lady . " They were embarrassed . How delicious ! Gormlaith flashed her eyes at them . " In my husband 's absence , I rule here ! If you have anything worth telling , tell it to me ! " The courtiers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consult with his Hy Neill kinsmen , and they had had ample opportunity to learn not to interfere with Gormlaith in his absence . But when he returned ... ! Looking around the room at their watchful , amused faces ,  |p342the  Ossorymen saw no help forthcoming . Reluctantly , they recited their recent history to Gormlaith . They were surprised by the quickness of her perception , the probing questions that went right to the mark . " How many fighting men were with the king of Munster ? Was the attack genuinely unprovoked , or was there a reason for it you are not telling me ? Are the roads muddy between Meath and Kilkenny ? Would it be possible for us to get warriors there in time to do any good ? " As the story unfolded it became obvious there was no immediateremedy to be offered Gillapatrick ; Boru and his hostageswould be safely home in Munster by now , no doubt encouraged to make further raids on his peaceful and lawabidingneighbors . " That savage will not despoil lands under the protection of Malachi Mor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ringing words . " How dare that upstart venture beyond his own borders ! Be thankful that you have an Ard Ri who will soon show him his proper place ! " She was working herself into a fine froth . It happened at lease once a day , sometimes more often , and nods and winks were passed around the chamber . Gormlaith in full sail was a sight to see . The messengers from Ossory were given food and bedding in the hall known as the House of the Hostages , and riders were sped southward to assure Maelmordha of the Ard Ri 's support ; a reassurance carefully couched in the most ambiguousof terms . Gormlaith retired to the grianan to reflect on the pleasures of power . Her maidservant hurried to bring her fruit and a goblet of mead . The girl was the latest in the long succession of women chosen to wait on Gormlaith ; a fair young woman from the Hebrides , blessed with silky hair and nimble fingers . Unique among women , Gorrnlaith could afford to have comely women surround her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dun na Sciath to the convening of court at Tara , she had sought out and befriended the most beautiful among the wives of Malachi 's nobles . She deliber-  |p343ately  kept the lady at her side in every light and situation , untilit became obvious to all that the young woman 's beauty paled in comparison to Gormlaith 's . The lady herself , horrifiedat finding herself devalued , sought other companionship , to her husband 's displeasure and Gormlaith 's amusement . But now Gormlaith had only her maids for company . " The Ard Ri will be surprised when he learns how well I am handling his affairs , " Gormlaith mused as she sipped her mead . " I 'm certain he will , my lady , " the servant replied , removingthe gilt slippers and gently propping her queen 's feet on a silk cushion . Gormlaith ran her bare heel over the fabric , testing the texture of both , seeking flaws . " Men have small vision , Ninianne , " she continued , tilting her head so that the girl could begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They only see the immediate problem , whereas women , being so much more involved with the inner workings of life , are able to enjoy a better perspective . We can think in terms other than bed , battle , and belly . " If I had not taken charge here , some little band of fighting men would have been sent south immediately , to placate my brother and go on chasing after the king of Munster in hope of winning a battle long since lost . Ridiculous . All those little skirmishes that seem to delight men prove nothing ; they have no grandeur about them . The outcome is forgotten in a fort-night . " The last comb removed , Ninianne began patiently untwistingthe strands of hair which held Gormlaith 's collection of tiny gold balls . In spite of her most careful efforts , something pulled , and Gormlaith spun around to deliver a backhanded slap that sent the girl reeling . Without pausing to acknowledgeher act or see its outcome Gormlaith continued talking , leaving the maid to pick herself and her combs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously required here is some grand gesture to show all Ireland that Malachi Mor is its ruler and no man may defy him with impunity . One sweeping blow that will linger in men 's memories . Less fun , perhaps , than a simple battle , but with more lasting effect.  | " This Brian Boru must be humiliated in some way ; humiliationis the best of punishments for a proud man . Surely I can think of something appropriate , some crippling insult to be dealt him , so that the plan will already be laid and awaiting only Malachi 's approval . Let me think ... what would cut the legs from under that Dalcassian ? " Malachi returned to Tara in a fine humor . In spite of recentdepredations by Norse pirates based in the Orkneys , the kingdoms in Ulster had sworn to pay a good tribute this year . After the lax years of Donall 's old age , a new and vital spirit occupied Tara ; things would be accomplished now  --  battles won , roads built , trade expanded . And his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of the future itself . He was pleasantly surprised that Gormlaith was so eager to be with him that she could not wait for him to discuss his trip with the council of state , but insisted on welcoming him immediately in his own bedchamber . Malachi had been entertainedlavishly in Oriel and Ulidia , but there was no such woman in all Ulster as Gormlaith . Gormlaith was equally pleased that he came so readily to her arms and bed . Best to tell him her ideas before those mossy old graybeards in the council chamber had a chance to get at him . While he lay dazed and sweat-drenched on her bosom , she told him of the attack on Gillapatrick . With her hot hands stroking him , cupping him , molding themselves to the shape of his muscles , she urged him to retaliate on Leinster'sbehalf . Malachi tried to collect his thoughts . " Why does n't your brother Maelmordha settle this thing himself ? It 's more his concern than mine . " She pulled out of his arms and sat up , her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlip thrust forward in a pretty pout . " Maelmordha has periods when the chirping of a bird too close in his chamber will send him to a killing rage , and at other times he is as slow and careful as an old woman with brittle bones . This must be one of the lat/ter , so I suppose the upstart king of Munster has gotten away with his vicious attack . Of course , it will mean a mark against the honor of the Ard Ri if you refuse to make some gesture on behalf of your wife 's brother . " The faintest of smiles touched her lips , faded , and came back again . " You know , " she purred , leaning toward Malachi , " there are ways to punish a man other than meeting him on the battlefield . It occurred to me that the king of Munster could be reprimanded as he deserves , by very few men and with almost no danger at all . . . " She fitted herself back into the circle of his arms , pressing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her husky voice became velvet , became samite , turned into an artist 's brush painting his imagination with brilliantly colored pictures . " You have an extraordinary sense of the dramatic , Gormlaith , " Malachi commented when she finished explainingher idea . " I 'm Irish ! " she offered as a comprehensive defense . " When I am well I feel better than anyone , when I am in pain I yell at the top of my lungs , and when I am dead I shall be deader than anybody . " Now  --  how do you like my plan ? Do n't you think it 's an idea worthy of a clever king ? " She was pressed against him from shoulder to feet , and her rich chuckle shook them both . On the summer-scented plain , the grass waved in green patterns beneath the shifting clouds . The tree had stood alone , unchallenged for centuries , in the center of its broad meadow . At its feet was the holy mound , the tomb of the founder of the tribe Dal Cais . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veneration , most precious symbol of Dalcassian nobility . Beneath its gnarled branches generations of tribal kings had sworn the Oath and received the bent knee of their people . Like hungry fingers , the roots of Magh-Adhair dug deep into the soil of Thomond , drawing nourishment for the mighty tree . In their blind search the roots found little pockets of woody decaywhich had once been other root systems , supporting olderp346trees on the same site . Magh-Adhair was but the latest in the line of royal oaks , a lineage as old as that of the Dalcassians themselves . Wicker baskets in the shape of animals had been burned beneath the spreading branches of its predecessors , while the cries of the sacrifices within those baskets mingled with the groaning and creaking of the oak tree in the wind  --  nature 's voices , beseeching nature 's gods . In later ages , Christian princes had received tribal kingship on the Plain of Adoration . Lorcan , Cennedi , Mahon , Brian  --  each in turn had come , bareheaded and awed by history , to kneel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aswirl with leafy recollections , fearing111 nothing , as the band of Meathmen dressed in country clothes came marching down the road , leading an oxcart . They might have been any group of folk on their way to market . When the oxcart reached the edge of the road opposite theii tree , the . men threw back their rough bratts , revealing the saffrontunics and serious weapons of warriors . Several of them gathered around the cart , lifted out the axes that lay within it and passed them to their comrades . The leaves of Magh-Adhair shivered . It might have been the result of a passing breeze . Hard , brutal blows rang across the Plain of Adoration . When the great tree fell it cried aloud with a voice not human ; unbearably forlorn . Even the Meathmen felt a sense of loss as they looked across the broad  --  now treeless  --  expanse of meadowland , its focus gone , its skyline empty . They threw their axes into the cart and hurried away , anxious to reach the friendly borders of Meath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a , the first small mortalities as rootlets died and the tenderest leaves shriveled . A curious badger emerged from his den , blinking , and peered with dim eyes at the vacant sky where the Great Shade had been . The first passers-by to see the fallen monument were a family of stonecutters from Ennis . Horrified , they spread the news across the countryside , and soon messengers were racing top347Kincora to stammer out the tragic story in Brian 's hall . " The sacredoak has been cut down ! Magh-Adhair is destroyed ! " Cries of horror rose from all sides . It was a sacrilege beyondimagining . Even the Northmen , out of veneration for their own mythical tree , Yggdrasil , had never profaned the holy symbol of Dalcassian kingship . Brian 's eyes narrowed to slits as he questioned the newsbringers . " Are you certain the tree was cut down deliberately ? Might it not have been toppled in a storm , or succumbed to some disease ? " " Oh , no , my lord , it was chopped right in two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there is worse yet to tell . " " What is it ? " " The banner of the Ard Ri is nailed to the fallen trunk ! " The sibilant in-hiss of breath was the only sound in the hall . Men 's faces grew white . There could be no mistaking the deadly insult . Brian reached out with his mind , trying to find a current of thought , an intuition ; straining across the distance that separatedhim from Malachi in an effort to read the man 's intentions . " It seems plain enough to me , " cried an Owenacht prince from the tribe Fer Maige . " Malachi fears your power and , never having met face to face with you , is using this way to test you . " " If that were what he wanted , he could have done it in a more forthright way than this , " Brian said thoughtfully . " MalachiMor has no reputation as a vandal . There is something more to this than we see on the surface , something else is involvedhere ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angry sound that swelled in volumes as each man turned to his neighbor to expresshis outrage . It rippled outward , carrying princes and warriors with it , heating their blood , edging them toward the massive doorway that led from the banquet hall into the forecourtof the palace . Brian felt them pulling away from him , leaning toward war . Beyond Kincora were armed soldiers capable of swift re/taliation ; men who had begun to fret with inactivity and were ripe for fresh skirmishing . He could understand the anger . On a purely irrational level of his consciousness he knew the desireto go howling along the road to Meath , screaming for vengeance . The death of Magh-Adhair was the wanton murderof a part of his heritage , an irreplaceable loss , as well as an insult of the most provocative nature . How blissful it would be to surrender to the voluptuous flood of rage ! If only I were not king , he thought , remembering the pure sweet fighting fury of his youth , undeterred by the responsibilitiesof consequence . He stood abruptly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose mind had been wandering elsewhere , blew a startled and discordant toot on his horn and someone laughed , easing the tension in the hall by the smallest degree . " I know your hearts ! " Brian cried aloud . " We must retaliate , we can not swallow this meekly or it will sit in our throats and choke us . I feel as you do ! " But this deed was done by the Ard Ri , or his agents , and I think it was meant as a gesture , not an outright act of war . If we attack the Ard Ri , ours would be an act of open rebellionagainst the highest temporal power in Ireland . It can not be undertaken lightly . " " He desecrated our holiest place ! " Murrough cried . Brian nodded . " So it seems . But by destroying MaghAdhair , the Ard Ri has acted specifically against the Dal Cais , not against all of Munster . For that reason I can not send the army of the entire province against him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Olchobar the Owenacht cried . " You will gladly fight , yes . That 's one of our problems . We have a long history of invasion by foreigners , and yet we are our own worst enemies , always ready to go at one another 's throats . Until we can turn our passions to better use than bloodletting we will always be a helpless , divided people , " Brian told them . But they were not listening . I can see it so clearly , he thought . But how can I make them see ? It is not possible now , they are already too preoccupied with the promisep349of battle . Later , though  --  later there will be time to bring all Irishmen together . But it will take warfare to make them accept it . He sighed . " Magh-Adhair ! Magh-Adhair ! " a warrior chanted , lifting his sword above his head . " Yes , " Brian said reluctantly . " Magh-Adhair . Go , then , and take your revenge , but I command you this : only Dalcassians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meathmen you find in Munster or along our borders . You will not attack any member of the Ard Ri 's personal guard , nor any woman or child . That is an order . " They swept out of the hall , chanting the name of the sacredoak , and Brian stood before his High Seat and watched them go . A picture of the tree flashed across his mind as he had seen it last , the day he stood beneath it cradling the hazelwoodwand of kingship . How huge and benevolent it had been , towering over them all , its wide-spread arms welcoming the Dal Cais , its rustling leaves whispering old secrets . Fiona would have understood . Fiona ! Her name and face moved before his eyes . How many nights and months had it been since he thought of her ? The image of the tree had summoned her . How she would grieve for that fallen patriarch ; how she would suffer for every blow of the ax . He stood lost in reverie . Strange to think of her now . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even living , and yet her face was more vivid in his memory than Deirdre 's , or all those eager women who had , somehow , never been enough for him . Fiona . Watching him , Reardon grinned in his beard and jabbed Corc with his elbow . " The king 's planning his own private revenge , " he chortled . " You wait  --  Malachi Mor will regret the day he insulted Brian Born ! "  |p350Men  entered the halls of Kincora with their belts strapped firmly about their waists , their weapons honed , fever in their eyes . Food somehow tasted better ; life was felt more keenly . The harpers played martial music with firmly strumming fingers . Brian mused to Padraic , " There is never such a thing as an isolated battle , is there ? One action always leads to another , and another ... The slightest disturbance on the surface of water causes ripples that spread outward farther than the eye can see , and eventually touch shores we may not even dream . " I feel things out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Magh-Adhair was part of something bigger ... something ... " He waved his hand in a vague half-circle , but ended the gesture with a closed fist . " It 's like having an adversary whose face I 've never seen , " he said . " I 'm not even sure it 's Malachi . I only feel a presence out there , waiting for me , influencing all our lives ... " Padraic cleared his throat meaningfully , glad of an opportunity to break into the rather painful tension building in Brian . " Someone is waiting , my lord , but I do n't think you could describe him as a faceless adversary . It 's the new historianyou sent for to be your , ah , secretary ? " Brian 's face lightened into a pleased smile . " Secretary and Counselor to the King , Padraic ; if the man is already here you must be certain you have his title right . He 's a great prize , you know . He was a brilliant scholar and an instructor at both Clonmacnoise and Glendalough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far exceeds mine , and I intend to pick his brain at every opportunity . What a pleasure it will be to welcome him and have him at my elbow ! " Padraic scowled.  | " As soon as he has refreshed himself , ask our new treasure to join us in the banquet hall , " Brian ordered , not noticing the look on Padraic 's face . His gaze had traveled across the hall , to the corner where Murrough was engaged in heated conversation with his brother Conor . Murrough 's voice did not reach Brian , but the obvious anger of his expression and gesture did . He was saying to his younger brother , " The king is giving the best commands to men with half the fighting ability I have , and ignoring the fact that I am his own blood son ! " " You might get more from him if you did n't argue with him all the time , " Conor pointed out . " If he says the sun 's shining you rush right in to say it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you complain that it 's rotten . you wo n't leave any statement of his unchallenged . Do you expect him to love you for that ? " " I want him to respect me , Conor . As a man ! I am full grown and sixteen years old , by God . How can he expect me to be just his echo , a little dog that trots at his heels and thinks he can do no wrong , the way Padraic does ? " " Well , he does n't do much that is wrong , " Conor replied . " The king our father makes very few mistakes ; that 's what makes him what he is . " Murrough brooded darkly over the statement . Strong and powerfully built , he was almost as tall as Brian , and his face beneath Deirdre 's tumble of dark curls was almost as beautiful . Ladies who had despaired of the king were beginning to turn their eyes toward his more accessible son . At length he said , " Even when I know I 'm wrong I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the time I realize it it 's too late and we are enemies again . " " So just do n't ever start , " Conor advised . " Well , he is n't always right ! " Murrough flared . " I 'm not an idiot , you know , I 've had some experience  --  as much as he 's allowed me  --  and I know that sometimes my grasp of a situation is better than his . " He makes the simplest issues hopelessly complex . Every action has to be weighed , measured , plotted in minute detail ,  |p352while  time creeps by . And then , more often than not , he substitutescaution for action ! " Take this matter of the tribe of the Deisi . They insist on trading with the Waterford Norse , who have n't submitted to us ; and the king has sent them a warning from Kincora but they merely ignored it . He should n't waste time warning and giving second chances . He has the authority , he can just march down there and crush them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else . But if I try to tell him that , all he does is repeat that old saying of his about the sword making enemies , not friends . " No other chieftain is like that ! Why does it have to be my father ? It maddens me to listen to him going on and on , explaininga lot of things that do n't really matter , when it 's obvioushe could accomplish so much more if he would just use the power he has ! " Before Conor could frame an argument , Padraic returned to the hall from his errand and made his way to the king 's High Seat . Murrough 's eyes followed him by chance , and then found themselves locked with Brian 's . Carried high on the wave of his anger , Murrough started toward the king , cryingout . " You gave the best command to Donogh ! You chose that silver-headed bastard over me ! " Brian braced himself . " Donogh is no bastard , " he replied coolly , a polite and meaningless smile on his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by me when his own parents died . " " He looks like a damned Norseman to me ! " Brian turned an expressionless face to Padraic . " You arrangedthat matter , Padraic , I believe , and dealt with the brehon ? What was Donogh 's parentage ? " " He was the eldest son of Connlaoch the Weaver , my lord , " Padraic replied with an equally blank face . " They lived just south of the Tipperary Road . " " Ah ... yes . I remember now . And Donogh has become a fine warrior and one of my ablest captains . He follows orders , Murrough ; I can always depend on him . There are times when that is more valuable than bloodlines , either his or yours . "  |p353Murrough  trembled with the need to answer , but he felt Conor 's hand grasp his arm , squeezing hard , and for once he bit his lip and held back the hot rush of words . He merely glared at his father and then spun around and left the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaryarrived . " I am Maelsuthainn 0 Carroll , " he said formallyto the herald at the door , " but my grandsire , Carroll , is dead now , and in honor to his memory I would like to use his name for my own . " The herald nodded and announced the name of Carroll to the hall of Kincora . The great scholar was by nature a round man , with a soft little belly that pressed outward against his belt . He wore the simple clothing of a monk , and the placid expression of a man who lived his life among books and in quiet rooms . He possessed a thickness of nose and chin as if he were storing littlepockets of fat for the winter . But his blue eyes were brilliantwith a lively intellect . The herald plucked at his arm . " Come and be presented to the king , my lord . " Brian Boru was the talk of southern Ireland , but Carroll had spent a lifetime studying myths and legends . In the old tales all mighty men were described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had long ago learned to accept that as a sort of illumination , like the marvelous designs with which the monks colored their manuscripts . Until he saw the Dalcassian . He stared at Brian Born in astonishment . The warrior king really was a giant , and magnificent beyond anything Carroll had imagined . Scarred from a hundred battles , his skin toughenedto leather by wind and sun , his copper hair lightly threaded with silver now , he was nevertheless a sight to race the hearts of his people and freeze the marrow of his enemies . The perfect proportions of his face and form made other men seem like careless imitations . Brian rose from his High Seat and stepped forward to give the stunned Carroll the ritual kiss of greeting , politely repeatinghis name  --  " Carroll , if you wish , at least for informalp354use "  --  then sat back down and waited . He always began by forcing the other person to establish communications . " I ... ummm ... am aware of the duties expected of me , my lord , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of them , " Carroll offered , watching the king 's face for some clue . But there was absolutely none . Brian 's eyes were friendly enough , in a remote way , but the features behind his carefully curled beard were unreadable . Distress widened Carroll 's eyes , and suddenly Brian took pity on him . " Do your job well and I 'll be content , historian , " he said , smiling with genuine warmth . " As Padraic will tell you , I 'm pleased with any man who does more than is requiredof him , and I have a low opinion of a man who does no more than he must . " Carroll beamed . " Then we 'll get along well together , my lord ! " He realized that his tone was too effusive , but he could jfq not help it . Brian awed him . " There is one thing you can do for me right away , " Brian said , lowering his voice so that the conversation was limited to the two of them . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common rooms , the other courtiers iillll busied themselves with their own dialogues . II ' Brian told Carroll , " My eldest son , Prince Murrough , is a gifted lad just coming into manhood , and it is my fervent hope that he will be able to follow me as ... king ... and continue to build what I begin . " But he has no patience with scholarship . The experience of one lifetime is not enough for any man , much less a ruler of kingdoms ; he must also have access to the knowledge and experience of many other lives , and for that he needs an ed- II ' ucation . Murrough resists the idea very strongly  --  perhaps because  it comes from me  --  and it would mean a great deal to me if you could influence him . " Carroll 's eyes shone . " I will do my best , my lord ! " Brian 's answering grin was warm and very engaging . " That 's all I ask of any man , " he said . " Always . "  |p355Padraic  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nobles and courtiers , and the complement of Brian 's Dalcassianswho were usually within hailing distance of their chief . The banquet hall itself impressed Carroll , and at one point he ceased his forward advance altogether and turned slowly , revolvinglike a cock in the wind , murmuring admiration . The interior walls of Kincora had all been plastered and they gleamed with lime , the smoke stains having been scrubbed from them each new moon . The banquet hall had not one but two great hearths , the bog oak stacked upon them , the coals always glowing . There was light everywhere in spite of the cavernous size of the hall , with its carven rooftreethat soared higher than six spear lengths . Rushlights and torches of bog fir burned at intervals around the room ; oil lamps hung by thong and chain from the rafters ; servants scurried about carrying candles . There was always enough light for a man to read by . Beyond the banquet hall were the separate houses which served as bedchambers and guest apartments . These were let into the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded ditch that bespoke this as a king 's house , and the bawn , the curtain-wall of timber and stone . " Who designed all this ? " Carroll asked Padraic . " The king did , " Padraic replied , glowing . " Brian can do anything . " By evening Carroll was not only familiar with the precincts of Kincora ; he had listened to several versions of Murrough 's latest grievance with his father over the tribe of the Deisi , and had asked Padraic a number of astute questions about the situation . At the evening banquet table he seated himself next to Brian 's oldest son . But it was not to Murrough that he addressedhimself . He carried on a lively discourse with his neighbor across the table , Conaing the Beautiful Chief , about the statesmanship of bygone kings . The air was rich with tales from history of great men who in the end the Deisi revolted outright , and Brian crossed the Shannon and headed south to repair the torn fabricof his kingdom . The king of Deisi was pursued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jeers of the Northmen before they agreed to put him on a boat to escape Brian 's punishment . The soldiers of the Dal Cais ravagedhis abandoned kingdom . " Tell every man that if he stands against me he is my enemy , " Brian ordered , " and I will treat him accordingly . All Munster must be of one mind and one will . " Accompanying him , Carroll dutifully recorded that the king of Munster was merciful to those who accepted his authority , and slew no rebellious Irishman without great personal sorrow . Along the northern and eastern borders of Munster , a constantcampaign of plundering and harassment continued to be waged against the men of Meath . Using the name of MaghAdhairas their battlecry , Dalcassian warriors attacked the edge of Malachi 's home province repeatedly , disrupting trade and shaking the confidence of Meathmen in their Ard Ri 's ability to protect his own kingdom . " Malachi Mor spends too much time visiting his noble relatives , drinking red wine , and singing in halls , and not enough time protecting us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Malachi was grumbling too  --  to his wife . " Gormlaith , I fear you have made a bad enemy for me in the king of Munster , " he told her with some bitterness . " Your plan was to assert my authority without bloodshed , and it seemed a good idea at the time , but plenty of blood has been shed since , mostly by my own tribespeople ! " " Perhaps you should encourage some other faction with a claim to the kingship of Munster , and replace this Boru , " Gormlaith suggested . Malachi had come to view his wife 's concepts of policy with a cynical eye . " I have neither the time nor the manpower to get involved with the internal affairs of Munster , woman . I 'm already fully committed to defend my Hy Neill kinsmen inp357the north from the foreign assaults on their coast . And I have difficulty closer to home , in Dublin . I thought that by putting that son of Olaf 's in control I would have some security on that front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irishman is safe within the city . " She sniffed . " I told you Gluniarand was a bad choice . Nobodyliked him , even his own father ; the man had a disgustingdisposition . " " So disgusting that one of his own servants murdered him , " Malachi fumed . " So now I must go to Dublin myself , reassert my authority , and find someone else to rule for me there . " " I could rule Dublin . " Malachi stared at her . " You surely ca n't think I would put you in charge of a Norse city ? " " And why not ? Ireland has known many great queens ! " " We 're not talking about an Irish queen . Whoever I install in Dublin must be my ally and help stabilize a balance of power between the Irish and Norse interests from Dublin to Waterford , or we 'll be cut off from all foreign trade on our eastern coast . For the life of me , Gormlaith , I can not imagine you as a stabilizing influence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked him in a voice turned to acid . Rather than answer her , Malachi left the chamber . Her voice rose behind him , rippling up and down the scale through all the shades of scorn . " You fool ! Who can you get to hold a foothold for you in Dublin ? You have no foothold anywhere , you pathetic little man ! Some truly strong chief , someone like the king of Munster , will rise against you and strip you of your precious title because you lack both the strength and the imagination to hold it ! I am the best asset you have , Malachi , and you are wasting me . Do you hear that ? I could help you , and you are too stupid to use me ! " Shaking his head , Malachi hurried to the council chamber to call a meeting of his advisors . " I must establish my own man as ruler of Dublin , " he explained , " but he must also be someone the Norse will accept . " " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatly.  | " There must be . Think , think ; give me a name . " " Sitric Olafson , " a wizened chieftain of the Clann Cholmain suggested . " Gormlaith 's son ? " " And why not ? He 's a young lad , still malleable , and his fatherwas a Norse hero . He 's Irish and Norse ; what could be a better bloodline for the purpose ? " Malachi sank onto a bench and closed his eyes , pursing his lips in thought . From time to time he nodded to himself His councilors watched him , not interrupting . At last he unlaced his fingers and looked up . " I like it ; it seems to be a practical solution . " " Will the queen agree ? " Kelly asked . Malachi closed his eyes again . " The queen rarely agrees to anything that is not her own idea , " he said in a tired voice . " But she has no say in the matter ; the boy is old enough and the authority is mine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the entire problem of my marriage and try to resolve it in some way , since this seems to be a time for solving problems . Gormlaith has given me no sons ; she is productive of nothing but trouble . I can not take her with me to other courts because I never know in whose bed I may find her , and I can not leave her behindwhen I travel  --  she either usurps my power or alienates my nobles . " They started to interrupt him in protest , but he held up his hand . " Ah , yes , it 's true and I know it . No denials are needed . I know where the fault lies . Nothing satisfies the woman , myselfincluded ; I doubt that any man or any reasonable degree of power would be enough for her . " She must be handled carefully or she will turn all of Leinsteragainst me , but at least no one can force me to share a roof with her any longer . I will give her an establishment of her own to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What about sending her to Dublin with Sitric ? " Malachi raised his brows in horror . " Oh , I think not ! Would you put a wolf to instructing the lambs ? " " You wo n't set her aside totally ? " Kelly asked  | " Not yet  --  it would cause too many problems with her brother Maelmordha . Besides , I 'm not anxious to take another wife right away . I have had enough of women for a while ! " Marcan , bishop of Killaloe , was paying a call on his brother at Kincora . With the passing of years Marcan found it harder and harder to go out of God 's peace and into the seething cauldron of the world . But Brian was directing much of Munster 's increasing wealth into the coffers of the Church , building schools and chapels , buying chalices , funding monasteries , raising monuments to God the length of Munster ; and it was necessary to appear at Kincora from time to time to express gratitude . Brian met with him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing fire against gray walls , and the youngest of the king 's many foster children were playing contentedly with the vast collection of wooden soldiers Flann had outgrown , under Teigue 's supervisory eye . Once he tired of the chore and came over to his father and uncle , leaving confidinglyagainst Marcan 's shoulder , breaking without shame into the conversation . " I 'm going to be a priest when I 'm all finished growing , " he remarked . " Are you now ? Have you the calling ? " Marcan smiled at the boy . Such a pleasant lad , with his thin neck , overflowing smile , and two ears sticking out like the handles of a jug . " Has Our Heavenly Father summoned you to do His work ? " the bishop asked fondly . Teigue blinked solemnly . " Oh , that is n't necessary ; I decided it for myself My brothers will be warriors , Sabia wants to have babies , and Emer wants to enter a convent so I thought I 'd choose something of my very own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and sauntered back to oversee his young charges as Brian and Marcan exchanged amused glances . " He certainly is your son , " Marcan said . " No limit to his ambitions ! " Brian narrowed his eyes . " What are you saying ? " " Merely that I hate to see you encouraging such boundless ambition in your children . Your Murrough , for example , is al/ready consumed with his desire to be bigger and better than you in everything . I understand he is making quite a name for himself among the ladies , and there is a certain faction among the young warriors that believes we would have more profitable warfare if his policies were adopted . His desire to best you is making his soul more bloodthirsty than yours , Brian , and it is a danger to him in the eyes of God . And perhapsmay come to be a danger to you personally  --  have you thought of that ? " It would be better for us all if you would devote yourself to storing treasures in heaven instead of on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A tiny spasm crossed Brian 's face , but he recovered quickly . " I share my treasures with the Church , and you do n't seem to object to that , " he observed dryly . " You never seem to criticizemy ambition as long as its benefits are directed towardthe ecclesiastical community . " With a patient glance heavenward , Marcan laid a gentle hand on his brother 's arm . I just fear you will overreach yourself , Brian , and lose all that you have gained . You can not deny that your motives have not always been the purest . " " You mean you only approve as long as I fight for the glory of God , but when I act out of revenge or to enrich the provinceince it is an example of my sinful ambition . " " All this fighting  --  is it really necessary , Brian ? Surely you realize you 're only encouraging retaliation ; outsiders will come into Munster and destroy all that you have built . The churches and monasteries will be looted again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that innocent round face and those guileless eyes , and it was hard to accuse him of selfishness . Could one be selfish on God 's behalf ? " I 'm always mindful of my responsibilities to protect the Church , Marcan . You remember that it was at myinstigation the illuminated gospels and othergatloYea go thatspirited church treasures and manuscripts were out of Ire1and before the Northmen could seize them and destroy the last remnants of our heritage . When our land is truly safe I will bring them back again , paying the expense myself " But I must balance all the consideration of both Church and state , brother , and that is not as one-sided a matter as you see it . You only fear for the Church  --  I must fear for the lives of my people as well as their souls , and to protect them I have to have a strong sword arm and a willingness to avenge wrongs done to them . " " And what about the wrongs you do to them , Brian ? What about all those noble hostages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If you had Christ 's compassion you would free them ... " " And their kinsmen would fall on me with swords and axes , " Brian finished for him , " and steal our cattle and probablyrob those churches of yours as well . The hostages do n't suffer  --  I am famous for my hospitality to them . And I have found it to be a sensible custom . As long as I hold hostages of good conduct , my physical control of their persons insures that their tribes will not act against me and my people . The concept did not originate with me , Marcan ; it is an old traditionand a good one . " " Why ca n't you just be satisfied with what you have alreadyachieved , dear brother , and live here in peace without further efforts to enlarge your power ? " Marcan asked . " You would be happier , you know . And you might live longer . " Brian 's thin smile was sarcastic . " Why do n't you just say what you think , outright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid I mean to take the offensive in other parts of Ireland , are n't you ? And you 're not afraid I will jeopardize my immortal soul by doing that ; you 're only afraid I will somehow lose . I ca n't be manipulated like Mahon , and so you see very little good in me , do you , brother ? " Why is it a man can not be appreciated by his own family ? I simply do n't understand that ! All I 've done has benefited you and the rest of Munster . Our tribe now owns all the land from the Shannon to the Slieve Aughty mountains , and there are gold chalices on your altars and new cells for your monks . " Yet you come to me in fear and trembling to beg me to put an end to my ambition and not endanger all that by losingit in warfare . And worse than that , perhaps  --  like a slyp362weasel , you sneak in a threat that my own son might harm me as a result of his ambition ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't you think I 'm aware of the whispering in corners ? There are others who think like Murrough , all right ; I feel their little daggers aimed at me from time to time . Any man who walks in power also walks with the expectation of a knife in his back . I live with that . You can not imagine what it 's like to live with that . It 's just one of the many , many details I have to deal with and handle . " " You could avoid such anxieties and not run the risk of losmg ... Brian cut him off angrily . " Do you think I will allow myself to lose , Marcan ? " Marcan rose and gathered his dignity around him like a new bratt . " You misunderstand me as usual , king of Munster , " he said haughtily . " And you misunderstand me , bishop , " Brian replied , not takingthe easy advantage of standing to tower over Marcan . " You just do God 's work your way , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed , " That fleet of warships you are building on the Shannon  --  do you call that God 's work ? " " If it is against His will , " Brian answered , " He knows how to stop me . " The Council of Twelve was convened to hear the annual reportof the brehons on the state of children in fosterage throughout the kingdom . It would be a lengthy meeting , as the records were read of each family 's fulfillment of their obligations as to clothing and education , and the elaborate bookkeeping involved was spread out on the council table for examination . The king 's council only concerned itself with the arrangementsmade within noble families of the highest rank , but nevertheless the procedure could take all day . On this day , however , the king had another matter he wished to discuss , and he hurried them through the business and sent the lawyerson their way with his thanks . The new subject was the ultimate and continuing problem of the Northmen . Beside their rankling presence , even the dy/nastic feuding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware of the foreigners always , a brooding menace at the edges of his land . " In general , Munster now accepts our rule , and the provinceis thriving , " he stated to his council . " But our prosperity is always conditional while the Northmen have the ability to threaten us . " I will speak to you of history , so that you will understand my position in its greater context . I feel that the time has come for us to dominate Leinster ... " There was a smothered gasp in the room. " ... and I trust you will agree with my reasoning when I have explained it to you . I have an excellent historian at my elbow  --  Carroll , here  --  to correct me if I make any errors , for though we are all educated men his knowledge is more thoroughthan any of ours . " As you may recall , great Caesar 's sandals never stuck in Irish mud . His conquest stopped with the Saxon lands , and Ireland 's ancient culture was preserved here undisturbed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver arm was grafted onto Nuada the Perfect in the legends . When the barbarians overran Rome centuries ago , the important knowledge of the civilized world was already safely in Ireland , transported westward with Christianity ahead of the vandal hordes . In our monasteries the world 's wisdom lay stored , protected , waiting to shed its light on a new and better age . " But this beautiful , unfortunate land dreams under one long curse , and the name of that curse is Invasion . It is the central fact of Erin 's history . One after another the rapacious invaders have come , since long before Christ , fleeing the cold , or barren land , or repression by tyrants ; descending on these shores to feast on the riches of this island until they have stripped it almost bare . Already the mighty forests are greatly diminished , the gold is gone from the streams , and the variety of game animals is much reduced . " This plundering of Ireland must stop . We must be left to ourselves , free of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rape and pillage ; for two centuries they havep364destroyed what they could not understand and taken the best we could produce to sell to other lands and fatten their own coffers . They have muddied Ireland with their ignorance and their barbarity , and much of the glory that was ours is destroyedforever . " What this long and tragic tale of conflict has done to the natures of the people is the saddest part of the story . The nobleclass is one seething mass of contention , family against family , and the under classes pay the price , for it is their effort that supports the warfare and their children who cry , fatherless , in their beds . The incessant need to fight for our lives , generation after generation , has turned us into a people whose society is devoted to fighting . All that is naturally aggressivein our natures has been honed fine . " To keep our defensive skills sharp we savage one another as a cat attacks its own tail to stay in practice for the rat . It has become so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , this eagerness to do battle . We can not set it aside until there have been generations of true peace in Ireland , and men no longer need to patrol the coasts , carrying spears and watching the horizon . Only after such a time can we learn to practice the arts of peace among ourselves . " Understand this at the outset : I do not want to kill Irishmen . But to drive the foreigners from our land we must first control the land ; all of it . The Northmen sit in strength in Dublin and in Waterford , and between them and us lies the kingdom of Leinster . Leinster , who fears and tolerates the invader . And marries its women to him willingly . " It must no longer be Munster and Leinster , but one land , southern Ireland , one nut too hard for the Northmen to crack . We will turn them into slaves or drive them into the sea , it mattersnot which , but we will have Ireland for ourselves alone ! " The heat was flowing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council in waves , warming , scorching , strikingsparks . Carroll felt the hairs on his arms rise as Brian 's cry was taken up in the echoing hall . " Ourselves alone ! "  |p367Fiona  saw a band of nobles riding to Kincora along the ramut and she hurried after them , hoping to glimpse Brian with them , if not in his splendid feathered chariot then on one of the lean quick horses he preferred for battle . But the group was led by Leti , with not one but two spear carriers trotting beside his horse , and it included a number of princes and warriors whose faces she did not recognize . Beyond the ridge where Brian had built his stronghold , the hills folded back upon themselves in layers of green and gold . Summer was over ; the campaign just getting under way would be the last major one before cold weather . Fiona felt the growing drowsiness of the world around her , the laying aside of climb and grow , the incurling and settling down of a land preparing for rest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , and as she watched she laid her palm against its trunk . Beneathher hand she felt the life flowing downward , out of the leaves and branches , into the welcoming earth . " Sleep well , friend , " she bade the tree gently , her hand caressingit once more before she turned to go . Then she heard the distant creak of the heavy gates being pushed open and she paused to look back , unaware that a stray sunbeam had sifted through the leaves to pin her in a shaft of light . Padraic had no gift for riding horses . He had come to it too late , his joints and tendons were already firmly set in the mold of the pedestrian . He and horses regarded one another with mutual misgivings . But as a highly ranked representative of the king of Munster , he must be appropriately mounted when undertaking an errand for his lord , and so on this morning he had selected ap368gentle-seeming horse from the stable and set out with a brave face and a nervous belly . He saluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare pranced beneath him . The breath of autumn air excited the horse , who had grown bored dozing in the stablepen , and as the gates closed behind her she tossed her head violently , snatching at the bit . Padraic gritted his teeth and jerked her to a standstill , anxious to establish some degree of authority over the beast before entrusting his life to her on the road . When she seemed quiet , he breathed a sigh of reliefand glanced around ... and saw the woman in the distance , haloed in gold beneath the elm tree . Startled , he turned the mare for a better look . He kickedthe horse and trotted toward her as Fiona became aware ofhis interest and turned to run . She dodged in a zigzag path through the trees , hearing the horse crashing behind her and the desperate profanity of its struggling rider as his face was slashed by branches . It was hard to keep sight of the fleeing woman , and even harder to stay on the horse inthe thick stand of trees , but Padraic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fine stag . Here was a clever quarry , indeed , and a mystery soon to be solved . He grinned in anticipation of tellinga fine tale inthe hall just as a low branch whipped across his face and nearly knocked him from his horse . And then , between one breath and the next , the woman was gone . The path lay empty and open before him , a dim road winding through the trees into the gloom of a narrow valley . The mare 's trot slowed to a walk and Padraic pushedforward warily , trying to analyze every pattern of foliage forthe discordant shape of a hidden watcher . It seemed he had ridden for miles . Surely the woman could not have come this far ! But by now he was reluctant to turn back , too committed to the quest to admit failure . A girl appeared beside the path so suddenly that his horse shied . Padraic scrabbled desperately for a handhold of mane , but the landscape spun around him and he hit the earth with a jolting thud . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone . When it did not materialize , he sat up gingerly . The girl knelt beside him . " Are you all right ? " she asked in a voice like the whisper of dry leaves . He looked at her in wonder , unable to answer . Her rippling hair was red-gold , a fall of molten copper in the shadowy light . Her features were finely chiseled and strangely familiar . The big brown eyes that regarded him with concern might have come from a doe 's face . " I said , are you all right ? " she repeated , leaning toward him . Seen at close range , she was not a girl but a sweetly maturedyoung woman . There was something about her face that was known to him , already achingly dear . He watched his hand reach to touch the strong curve of her cheekbone . " I 've never felt better , " he told her honestly . " It 's glad I am to hear it , " she replied , lowering her eyelids before the intensity of his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch your horse for you . " She rose and chirruped to the mare , who was grazing beside the path , and the horse came at once , dropping her head to receive the touch of the girl 's hand . " How did you do that ? " Padraic asked in surprise . " Ach , ' t is easy to talk to animals . They 're not like ... " " Not like what ? " " Like people . " She looked as shy as a coney , ready to break and run , but there was strength in her face and a hidden merriment that twinkled in the depths of her eyes . " Do n't you see many people ? " he asked her . " A fair lass like yourself , so close to Kincora ... " Her eyes widened in alarm . " I never go there ! I rarely come this far , but I wanted to fetch my mother . She walks in these woods sometimes , and today she went off without her woolens and the weather 's turned raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is your mother a small woman , rather dark , with some sort of brown robe ? " " Aye . Have you seen her ? " Padraic hesitated between the truth and a polite fiction.  |p370What  would Brian do ? The king would certainly never come right out and say he had chased this beauty 's mother through the woods like a wild animal ! " Ah ... I believe I saw her back there a way ... " he gestured vaguely toward Kincora , " but she was headed in this direction . No doubt she 's on her way home and you 'll be seeing her very soon . " The girl smiled gravely and watched as he pulled himself awkwardly onto the horse . " Will I be seeing you again ? " she asked shyly . Padraic , a man long grown and with some experience of the world , felt his ears growing hot and his heart racing . " If I knew where we might meet ... ? " he said hopefully . At Kincora he was the recipient of much teasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king , neglecting his duties to go off in the hills chasing a woods-woman ? " Why , man , there are scores of women within the palace walls who 've made eyes at you , if you 'd but notice , " Laoghaire the Black told him . " Aye , " his brother Red Laoghaire added , " and when they faded away for lack of you I 've been here to console them ! " " The king and I have no time for women , " Padraic said loftily . " Oh , well , the king ... that 's one thing . I think we all agree he will not soon commit his heart again ; that is a wound scarred over but not healed . An occasional lady to warm his bed , perhaps  --  but you , Padraic ? You have not even taken your share of bedwarmers . Until now ! " They laughed and winked at one another . " This is different . " Padraic drew himself to his full height and glared at them . Guffaws . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is short and that one is tall and the other yells in bed and squirms like a ... " Padraic 's face was crimson around its freckles . " I wo n't have you talking about Niamh that way ! " he cried , knotting his fists . Brendan grinned at him . " So it 's Niamh , is it ? And who isp371this Niamh who has bewitched you away from us and is so different from other women ? Why do n't you bring her to Kincora and let us have a look at this treasure ? " Padraic rounded on him . " You 'd like that , would n't you ? Well , you 'll all have a long wait ; I have to have some private life , you know ! " He stalked away from them , fists still clenched , shoulders rigid . " Whew ! " breathed Carroll , who had entered the hall in time to hear the end of the conversation . " What was that all about ? " " Padraic has a woman hidden away somewhere , bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . But he has n't brought her to Kincora for the king 's approval , for some reason . There was a time when Padraic would n't squat over a pot without Brian 's nod . " " Padraic takes everything seriously , " Carroll commented , " himself foremost . But if he wants to have a private lass , that 's his business and we should let him be . " Brendan , whose high voice was always so unexpected issuingfrom his bull neck and massive chest , said , " You 're more generous to Padraic then he would be to you , Carroll . " " What does that mean ? " " The man 's so jealous of you and your closeness to the king that it put him off his feed , even before he took up with this woman of his . " " Padraic and I are friends ! " " That may be , but if the king snapped his fingers for Padraic just as you stepped between them , Padraic would leave you lying on the ground with his footprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and all but worshiped him since he first joined us . Now you spend so much time with the king he fears you 're trying to supplant him . " Carroll was taken aback . " I mean to do no such thing ! I am merely filling the position assigned me . Why , I do n't even call the king Brian ' the way the rest of you do ; he 's never encouragedme to be so familiar . " He thought for a moment , then a slow smile spread across his face . " Now that I think ofp372it , it was Padraic himself who told me the king was only called Brian by his very closest friends . " " He has a lot of close friends , then ! " Laoghaire the Blacksaid with a snort . " Padraic was trying to keep some distance between the two of you . He 's gotten cunning as a fox over the years . " " He learned it at Brian 's knee , " Brendan said , and they all laughed . Padraic and Niamh met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kincora . It gnawed at him , leaving Carroll to hear Brian 's inner thoughts , but Carroll found ways to set him at peace by mentioning , casually , what a private man the king was and how much he kept to himself . It is all right , then , Padraic thought . He makes speeches for the historian , but he does not really share himself Only I am his true friend . He boasted of it to Niamh . Fiona was never there when he met the young woman , although cold weather forced them to stay in the warmth of the little cottage Niamh shared with her mother in the lee of a hill . " Mother goes out in all weathers , " Niamh explained . " She hates being under a roof . " When he had gone back to Kincora Fiona would appear , red-cheeked and icy of hand , anxious to sit by the fire and hear Niamh repeat Padraic 's tales of the king . She devoured every word , greedy for the smallest detail of Brian 's life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is it really so ? What did he do then ? " " Padraic assures me it is true , and he is the king 's only confidant . He says he knows everything about him . " " Everyone must tell his secrets to someone , girl . " " Not you , Mother . You keep all yours to yourself . " " I tell them to the trees , " Fiona said . " You are one of the trees , Mother , " Niamh said laughing . " But seriously , you are still a healthy woman ; you could find a man like my Padraic and be happy . " " He is n't your Padraic , " Fiona reminded her . " People do not belong to other people , only to themselves and the gods . The time for me to have a man has come and gone ; it wouldp373not be appropriate for me now . I have other , more important , things to think about . " When Fiona spoke in that faraway voice , her " vision " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean the guardianship , Mother ? " Fiona nodded . A fat tabby cat came and rubbed against her thin ankles ; the evening meal bubbled in its cauldron , sending up a rich aroma of winter meat and herbs . She sat quietly for a time , gazing into the fire , and then she spoke again . " The old ways are gone and all but forgotten , Niamh . Most of our race is dead now . But the gods are not dead . This is their land and they are part of it , part of every tree and bird and flower ; and we must protect it for them as best we can . We are sworn to their service ; I , by my grandfather , and you , by me . " " But there are so few of us left , Mother  --  you said that yourself . What can we do when we have so little strength ? " " We keep our race and our obligation alive as best we can , my child . Long ago , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Brian of Boruma . It was his wish that Brian 's blood be added to our race , to give us a link with all the tomorrows . " Niamh sat very still , staring at her mother . " Padraic says Boru is the greatest man in Ireland , " she whispered proudly . " Aye . He is the hope for the future , and it is the will of the gods that we guard and watch over him . I am not as strong as I used to be , Daughter ; perhaps the time has come to summonthe remnant of our people and charge them to share in our task . If we must vanish , yet we can continue to live in Bore 's children , so long as there is some thread carrying forwardinto the future until we are reunited in other worlds , in other lifetimes . " Remember the old ways , Niamh ; remember everything that I have taught you . If the time comes when Brian needs a gift that only the gods can provide , and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others to see to it . " Fiona sat withp374closed eyes . The smoke from the fire drifted around her , swirling , spiraling . When Niamh 's belly began to swell , Fiona took her away . Padraic was distraught . " I should have married her ! " he moaned to his priest . " I begged her to , but she did n't believe in the Christian marriage and I could not give myself to paganritual . " " You did the right thing , my son . " " I do n't think so ! " Padraic cried . Now the king and I have something in common , he told himself in the dark watches of the night . We have both lost our women . Brian 's mind was not on women , but on the campaign to dominate Leinster , the skirmishes with Meath , the delicate shiftings in the balance of power between Munster and Connacht . The kings of both north and south Connacht had taken fright at the growing strength of their neighbor and were torn between war and negotiation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic ploys and military stratagems , and when he went to bed at night his brain did not rest but churned on , invading his sleep until it was no different from wakefulness . Even so preoccupied , he could not help noticing the change in Padraic . The whimsical quality was gone from his aide 's face , leaving it gaunt , with long vertical lines that ran from below his cheekbones to the edge of his jaw , showing through his slight beard . He no longer followed like a shadow at Brian 's heels , nor tried to place himself between the king and Carroll in the banquet hall . There was something definitely amiss with Padraic . Brian summoned him to his chamber , the sacrosanct room that even Padraic rarely entered . " I 'm concerned about you , " he began without preamble . " I 'm all right , my lord . " " You 're all wrong , Padraic , and everyone at Kincora isp375aware of it . If you feel ill , speak to Cairbre the physician or get a tonic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll fix it . " Padraic 's smile was crooked , threatening to slide off one side of his face . " Even you ca n't fix this , my lord . " " Oh . It 's a woman . " " Yes . " The two men sat in a companionable silence for a time . Then Brian said , " She wo n't have you ? " " She did , but she 's gone . Run away . I 've searched everywherefor her , even sent agents to try to find her , but she 's vanished from the earth . " " Did she care for you , this lady of yours ? " " I thought she did . But she was not a lady , my lord ; she was a woods-woman , a practitioner of the Old Religion . " " Is that why you never brought her to court ? You should have known better than that . " " I tried , but she would n't come . Her mother would n't allowit ; they were a strange family . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never see her again . " The pain skewered through his voice , twisting it into a shape Brian recognizedall too well . He looked in understanding at Padraic , and their eyes met in the gentle brotherhood of vulnerability . " I 'm sorry , Padraic . " " Thank you . " Brian poured out two goblets of mead for them from the flagon on his table , and handed the first-poured to Padraic . " Sit here with me a time , " he offered . They drank in silence . At last Brian said , " I wish I could tell you how to endure loss , my friend , but I have no talent for it either , as you know . The only thing I 'm certain of is that no words make it easier . You just live through it , get it behind you , and come out on the other side . If you want her and think you have a chance of making it come right , stay with it until you find her . " Padraic 's shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find her , my lord . If she had really wanted to be with me , she would n't have let her mother take her away . " There was something Brian could give him , although thep376words were hard to say . He spoke carefully , searching among his store of phrases for those that would mean the most to Padraic . But it was strangely embarrassing . A small betrayal of Murrough , who would not care if he knew . And the knowledge that Murrough would not care was painful . " You know , Padraic , " he said aloud , " my oldest son and I are not ... as close as I might wish . Have not been since I punished him for killing the prince of Desmond . " " I know , my lord . He never understood that , I think . " Brian gave a hollow laugh . " As well for me that he did not ! But it 's become a wedge between us , and every year we grow farther apart . Now we are almost strangers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement deliberately to catch Padraic 's eye , and then he held the gaze . " You are more a son to me than Murrough , Padraic , " he said , wondering how much he really meant it . But the light it kindled in the other man 's eyes was unmistakable . " I would not want you hurt if it were in my power to help you , " Brian went on , " and if there is anything at all I can do for you in this matter , you have only to ask . " In the silence that hung between them Padraic recognized the size of Brian 's gift and tried valiantly to find a way to match it . " Prince Murrough loves you , my lord ! " he offered . " Fathers and sons grow apart , but they come together again in time ; it always happens ! " " Some things are not meant to be , Padraic . It is easier to accept it than to torture yourself with regrets . That is good advice for both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps we will not be haunted by too many ghosts . Come around here and help me unroll this map , I want to select a site for a new garrison on the Blackwater ... " Grateful and flattered , Padraic moved around the table to stand beside his king . When he looked down at the seated Brian 's coppery hair , he was surprised to find that something about it brought a painful lump to his throat.  |p377The  next day , after surprising Murrough at the center of a knot of low-voiced men who stopped speaking entirely as he approached , Brian called Carroll to his chamber for a private meeting . " Carroll , " he began bluntly , " is there anything to this problem with Murrough ? He does n't seem to be accepting my authorityany more than he ever has , and I feel there are other factions that might be encouraging a full-scale break between us . Carroll narrowed his eyes and considered . " Your son loves you , my lord , " he said carefully . " I loved my brother . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leinster seemed to have capitulated to the superior force of Brian Boru . Maelmordha and the other princes sulked in their strongholds or contended among themselves for the vacantkingship of the province , but sent no further raiding partiesinto Munster . Malachi Mor was also feeling the weight of Brian 's hand . Satisfied as to his control of the land below the Shannon , the king of Munster was turning his full attention to Connacht . Council was convened at Tara , and the prospect was viewed in a sour light . Dt nlang the Wise expressed the thought uppermost in the mind of everyone . " If Boru forces Connacht to stand with him , he will control more warnors than the Ard Ri himself " " He has made no attempt on Tara , " Malachi pointed out . " We ca n't actually accuse him of leading a rebellion against my authority . " " He attacks Meath ! " Malachi tried hard to be fair . " He had some provocation for that ; I let myself be persuaded to act in a way that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the more violently inclined nobles argued , " the skirmishes along the border have gone far beyond simple acts of retaliation . Munster is all but at war with both Meath and Connacht , and there is only one way to interpret that ! "  |p378Malachi  moved around to see their point of view , and found that he agreed with it as well . It was part of the problem with being fair ; if one was totally objective , there often seemed to be no right or wrong . " Boru is suffering heavy losses in Connacht , " he said . " It certainly does look like an all-out war for control there . " " Then this would be a good time to attack him and destroy this threat once and for all . Surely even the king of Munster can not sustain active warfare on two fronts and keep control of his under-kings and the Norsemen as well . " At last Malachi agreed , feeling a certain sense of relief at being forced to act . " Very well , then . While Boru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to this thing before it goes any further . Give the order to summonthe war counselors , and we will choose the most auspiciousmoment to attack . " Cut and thrust and slash , swing the ax , whip your horse forward , sweat and grunt and dodge , scream till your throat was bloody with the constant repetition of orders unheard above the din of battle . Fergus was slain by a Northman 's ax . March , march , slog through mud and scramble over hills , lose some of your best men in an ambush in an oak forest so dense there seemed no sky above it . Fight to win the people 's loyalty , bury more friends , pray , swear , struggle . Worship at the altar of Discipline and try to grind it into your officers until they could be trusted as you trusted your own hands . Brian 's sons rode with him , two of them gladly , and the third , wrapped in his own thoughts . Conor and Flann fought well but had no gift for leadership . Murrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , fought like ap379demon and was a magnet for the loyalty of men , but he constantlycriticized his father 's command decisions . When Liam mac Aengus fell in battle Murrough asked for his warriors , but Brian reluctantly gave them instead to Donogh mac Connlaoch . Donogh did not risk men 's lives unnecessarily in the name of valor . The tension between Murrough and his father was as sharp as a dagger 's edge . Donogh 's obedience and his love of the land were total , and sometimes Brian found himself watching the silver-haired young man with speculative eyes . Donogh had much to give Ireland . Brian ordered still more boats added to his fleet , which was proving a successful deterrent to Norse aggression on Ireland'sinland waterways . The new ships were built of wood in the style of the Norse dragonships , shallow drafted for rivers and coastal waters . They enlarged his assortment of common log canoes and the ubiquitous curraghs , which were built on a framework of ash lashed together by alum-soaked leather thongs and covered with oxhide . Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet weather , and replacingthem with lightweight ones of woven flax . The fleet sailed northward from Killaloe , through the dark waters where the mountains came almost to the river 's edge , and then moved out onto the broad blue breast of Lough Derg itself . The countryfolk came out to see them glide by  --  Irish ships , not vildng raiders  --  and blessed them and thanked God for Brian Boru . It was whispered  --  a rumor that came from nowhere , with no discernible source , but was somehow heard by everyone  --  that no matter which direction the king of Munster chose to sail , the wind was always with him . Some said it was witchcraft , and some said it was an act of God . Brian went south to hold court at Cashel and was appalled at the long lines of people streaming down the road toward the Rock , each with a boon to beg or complaint to air . The endless struggle against the encroaching grass must be waged along the roads , and men found to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to market and warriors to war . The high court was convened , and valuable hours spent hearing one lawyer debate his interpretation of the Brehon Law against another ; books sent for , piled on tables , consulted , judgments made  --  enemies , too ; under-kings placated , fairs and feasts attended , a new Norse outburst put down , troops reviewed , officers trained , ambassadors received , motives analyzed ... and still another battle to fight . The ships and the foot-soldiers returned to Connacht . The king of the tribe Muscraige was a happy man . His tuathwas prosperous and his compound sheltered a large healthy family . The fields of his land grew good grain , heavyheadedand golden in the sun ; his cattle were fat and his wife was docile . Even the bishop at Cashel told him he was a man blessed by God . Then the Meathmen came , marching in quick columns across the land , taking advantage of Brian 's absence to drive into his heartland . The armies of Munster were fighting on Connacht , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the king of Muscraige . Only his own warriors were available to fight the hopeless battle , and when the sun set the happy king was dead and his docile wife was a banshee shrieking in the night with grief . Brian returned to Kincora , victorious in the most recent encounter with Conor 's army , and was told the news of the Ard Ri 's attack . He listened to the story intently , his gray eyes glittering with anger . " Malachi will not face me directly , man to man , but comes sneaking into my kingdom in my absence to cut my people down , like a wolf separating one sheep at a time from the flock . Does he mean to exterminate us tribe by tribe ? " Someone suggested , " This raid is very like our own raid last month on the Caille Follamain . Malachi killed more men , but otherwise his expedition might have been modeled on ours . " Brian arched one eyebrow . " I 've noticed something about the Ard Ri . He does not act ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a leader , I think , this habit of always taking the second step . He appears to deal with each situation as it occurs on its own terms and in its own context ; he fights a hundred little battles and overlooks the war . " He turned to look directly at Carroll , holding the historian'sgaze for a meaningful moment , then spoke to the entire hall in ringing tones . " Ireland would be better served by a differentHigh King . " Carroll understood , but duty forced him to say the words anyway . " Malachi Mor is the ranking member of the tribe Hy Neill , my lord . The Ard Ri is always Hy Neill . " Watching the king , they all knew what was coming . It filled the room with them , tightening their throats and racing their hearts . Even Padraic lost his customary halfsmile as he leaned forward , elbows on knees , to wait tensely for the words Brian was bound to say . " The Ard Ri has always been Hy Neill , traditionally , " Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . " Has been . But no more . A ruler must be the man best suited to rule , not a man determined by tradition . If Ireland is to take her rightful place in the world , she must do so with her strong hand uppermost . " He stood in front of his High Seat , slowly raising his right hand in front of him , so that they could all see the size of it . The strength of it . He lifted it like a banner , and their eyes watched it ascend . " The days of the Hy Neill are over , " said Brian Boru . " He has gone mad with ambition ! " " He has promised new glory to Ireland . " " He will get us all killed ! " " He will bring back the Golden Age . " " He 's a monster ! " " He 's a saint ! " " It 's about time , " said Murrough . There was no disguising the intent of Munster now . Armies in Roman-style columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bantry Bay . As if overnight , an enormousorganization sprang into being , capable of feeding men and supplies in great numbers into Brian 's military base on the Shannon . Like the Northmen , he used the river as a highway , and by following its watercourses he was able to reach long fingers of attack into Connacht and Meath . From the Suir he sent a wall of men marching eastward to Leinster , his determination written on their faces , his battle cry on their lips . The struggle for the control of Ireland was joined . Malachi was no longer able to view it as part of the old familiarpattern of king against king , tribe against tribe . Brian marched through Ireland making speeches , repairing schools and monasteries , appointing new bishops , firmly enmeshing himself in the hierarchy of the Church while attracting a new generation of hot-eyed young soldiers to the glories of the battlefield . He fought continually , and there were some defeats but many more victories . He flung his grandeur ahead of him like a challenge . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a frightening man . " What does it mean ? " Malachi asked his advisors again and again . " Why should this king of Munster lead a revolt against the established order ? It all began as a misunderstanding , an argument between tribes ... it should never have come to this ! " " Bore is an outlaw , " they told him . " He used his military skill to put his brother on the High Seat of Munster , and then stole that kingship for himself from its rightful heirs . He is a man of great fighting ability and no principles . " Malachi turned to them with imploringly outstretched hands . " What am I to do ? There are rumors that he is winningmy people away from me . His red banner with its three lions has been found hanging from trees and poles in my own Meath , and the countryfolk refuse to cut it down . " " He must be destroyed ! " they shouted at him in unison , allp383those old men , past their fighting days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I agree , he must be stopped , " Malachi said , " but how can I give it my full attention when Sigurd and his Norsemen wait in the Orkneys to attack us once more and there is always the possibility of an uprising in Dublin ? The king of Munster has somehow amassed a very large army , and persuaded even his traditional enemies to stand with him ; what can I bring to bear against that ? " They offered him advice  --  every man had some  --  and he patiently listened to each in turn , hoping that one suggestion would strike fire in his own mind . None did . Malachi Mor lingered at Tara , forcing his council and under-kings to remain in session with him , considering his problem . The loveliest of Ireland 's hills was no longer beautifulto him ; it had become a prize that could be wrested from him , a position he would have to defend with his blood . " I 'm not afraid to fight this Brian Boru , " he told Kelly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battle . But first I must be certain that whatever policy I follow is the right one . I must get down on my knees and pray to Jesus Christ to protect me from rash impulses , because every time I give in to one connected with this Boru I get in greater difficul-ties . " He stared gloomily into space . " Damn Gormlaith , " he said . " Eh ? " " It was my ill-considered marriage to her that caused all this . She was the one who turned the king of Munster against me , with her shrewish scheme for insulting his tribe . That was the beginning of the feud between us . And now I know she whispers in her brother 's ear , alienating Leinster from me as well . They will accept Boru and repudiate me . " " Perhaps , if you restored her as your queen ... ? " Malachi stiffened in alarm . " Oh , no ! Even if I could guaranteethe devotion of Leinster for a thousand years , I would not sit at a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced around to be sure that none but his nephew heard him . " I tell you , that woman unmanned me !  |p384It  's true  --  me ! Nothing I ever did was enough for her , and at last I could n't do anything at all . You think I could take her back ? I 'd rather go into a monastery , like Olaf Cuaran ! " Malachi paced and worried , and Brian 's influence spread . In desperation , the Ard Ri applied to the kings of Connacht to enter into a military alliance with him against Munster , but Conor , over-king of the province , expressed grave reservations . " I am not anxious to have the Ard Ri bringing troops into my land , " he told Malachi 's emissaries . " Armies of alliance become armies of occupation all too easily . " Malachi took the rebuff with a sinking heart and planned new overtures . At his request , the king of Maine , largest of the subkingdoms of Connacht , rode onto the land of the Conors with a deputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited at Tara , feeling himself squeezed in a relentlessly closing vise . Taking full advantage of the situation , the Northmen in Dublin encouraged their jarls to throw off the appearance of subjection to the Irish Ard Ri and once more sailed dragonships into the Liffey and the Boyne , laden with pirated goods and still wearing the fearsome wooden heads that stated their intent to kill and plunder . Sitric Olafson remained snug within the walls of the Norse fortress and made no effort to interfere on behalf of the Ard Ri . Malachi began a desperatebattle on two fronts , pitting his strength against the foreignerson the east coast of Ireland and the emerging titan from the south . Brian 's ships advanced farther and farther northward , movingup the Lough Ree once more , every dip of the oars edgingthem closer to the northern kingdoms . Men at Sligo began to speak of Brian Boru , and ambassadors were sent southward at the gallop from Oriel and Ulidia to ask the Ard Ri 's intentions . It was a bad time for Malachi . The tongue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but combined with the fear of the Munstermen it was sufficientp385to win a conditional military alliance between Connacht and Meath . " We have word from the south that Leinster has capitulatedtotally , and Brian Born rules all of southern Ireland from the Dingle peninsula to the Wicklow mountains . " The Meathmenurged Conor , Join with us , or Connacht and Meath will fall together as he marches to take Ulster as well ! " Conor , suspicious of all this vast shifting of armed men and alliances , gave his tentative agreement , but he slept with a sword by his bed and ordered a new fortress built for himself ; with sturdier walls . The weather turned cloudy , then chill , then unremittingly hostile with the onset of a vicious winter , and men began to think longingly of their hearths . Brian ordered the fleet back to the safety of Lough Derg and had the boats hauled up onto the shore for repairing during the winter months . Nature'speace was imposed , briefly , on the ambitions of men . But the struggle for power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armies from Meath and Connacht establishedwinter camps within hailing distance of one another , trying simultaneously to stand guard against a possible winter invasion from the south and to watch each other for some sign of treachery . It was a fragile bond that united them , and Malachi and Conor both knew it to be temporary at best . The two provinces had enjoyed too many years of warfare with each other to be fast friends now . It was a chieftain of Connacht who suggested building a massive stone fortification across a narrow stretch of the Shannon , to block Brian 's ships when they came north in the spring . It was a chieftain of Meath who hurried to Malachi to suggest that the plan was merely a disguised opportunity for establishing a large causeway to carry invading Connachtmen into Meath itself . Malachi listened to both equally convincing arguments and scratched his head . The bed was cold at night . Perhaps the blankets were too thin for the severity of the winter . Brian lay awake and stared into the darkness , wondering why he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage bargainingfor special privileges , or a noble lady whose eyes had made extravagant promises across the banquet hall . But there was a sameness about each encounter that depressed him . " You are lovely , " he would say , paying in the simplest coin . " And you , my lord ! " At least that was true ; he knew it by the way their eyes widened when he removed his clothes . The broad chest with its mat of golden hair , the rippling muscles and bulging thews relatively untouched by the years , the lean flat belly and firm legs were best appreciated by a woman lyingwaiting on the bed . But when the woman 's body opened to receive him it was always the same . The hot pleasure was not quite hot enough , or intense enough ; the climax came a little too quickly , and left a residue of unrelieved hunger behind . Or the woman felt fragile beneath him , and he throttled his passion and held his great strength under rigid control , so that what satisfaction he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right woman , and his mind knew it . It went galloping off without him , plotting campaigns and writing speeches , to be called back for a reluctant moment when the pressure burst and the hot rich flow demanded mindless participation , but then his thoughts were gone again , drifting off to other places where the woman  --  whoever she was  --  could not follow . And when she tried to cling to him Brian felt a certain uneasiness , often amounting to distaste , and inevitably drew away . No woman was invited to his bed twice . The time came when Carroll asked him the question all Kincora had been wondering . " Will you take another wife , my lord ? " Brian was slow to answer . " I had a wife , once . When we were married , I thought she was all I ever desired in a woman . " His fingers plucked idly at a holly bush that had grown tall since the first stone was laid at Kincora . " But perhaps I asked too much . Neither of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hurt again like that . " I 've never found a lady who contained all that I want in a woman , or wanted all that I contain . No one to match mep387stride for stride , and understand what goes on in my mind and heart . I suppose I thought I could find someone who would be able to understand my dreams and listen to my plans , as Fithir used to listen to my brother Mahon . Some lovely woman who would laugh with me and yell with me and not flinch if I forgot and roared at her ... and yes , by God , carry a sword and fight at my side if it came to that . And still be female , and soft in her secret places , and sit besideme in the autumn while I played my harp for her , or she read poetry to me . " He gave a mirthless little laugh . " Some dreams are impossible , Carroll . I 've made so many of mine come true , I suppose it is inevitable that there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still in your prime , my lord , " Carroll replied . " There are years ahead of you . . . " " Are there ? " Brian asked . Brian held court at Kincora , the Christmas court of holinessand revelry . It was to be the grandest scene of pomp and power ever held in southern Ireland , and invitations to attend were carried by runner and rider to every noble of importancethroughout the kingdom Bore held . And to some who lived beyond it . To their astonishment , the kings of the southern tribes of Connacht found themselves giving hospitality to couriers from Munster , who came bearinggifts of peace and an invitation to celebrate Christ 's Mass at Kincora . Brian had explained it to Padraic , and tried to explain it to Murrough . " You 'll see  --  at least some of the princes of Connacht willp388respond to my invitation . Curiosity will bring them , or fear , or the desire to have alliances partially established with me in the eventuality that Malachi fails them . " I 've been scrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man who is a guest beneath my rooftree can be assured of the utmost courtesy . No man can accuse me of the smallest degree of mistreatmenthere ; no guest needs to enter my gates carrying a sword , and everyone knows it . " " These are men we have fought , my lord ! " Murrough argued . " They should have the edge of the sword , not a fat goose . " " There is more than one way to win a victory , Murrough . Carroll could tell you of times when battles were won , when no man felt dishonored and no blood was spilled . If you would only listen to him ... " " Trickery and guile , " Murrough said angrily . " If you meet men on the battlefield you solve everything at once , cleanly . All of this subtle playing of games accomplishes nothing ! The Connachtmen , if they come , will have full bellies at our expenseand a good look at our defenses , and what will you have gotten in return ? " Brian grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , I 'll have the pleasure of sitting on my High Seat and watching them try to figure me out ! " They came to Thomond , the hardy , thin-lipped princes of Connacht , in their chariots or on horseback , surrounded by spear carriers , restless of eye and nervous of hand . They came to see and assess the strength of the king of Munster , and they stayed to wonder . And to laugh , and sing , and dance . Christmas at Kincora . Brian greeted each of his guest with open-handed cordiality , appearing oblivious of their suspicious faces and armed escorts . Carroll entered each name on the list he was compiling for the king . ( " Any man who comes will be brave , Carroll , and dangerous . It 's good to have a record of such men . " )  |p389Lavish  guest houses had been built for the visiting nobles , and the royalty of Connacht could not fail to notice that theirs were as sumptuous as those furnished the princes of Munster  --  or more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to holy celebrationand feasting in the palace on the Shannon . The bishop of Munster presided over the religious ceremonies , and the numerous abbots and bishops who owed their appointmentsto Brian were conspicuous by their presence , and lavish in their praise of the king . " No man in Ireland has worked so hard to build and strengthen the Church since blessed Saint Patrick himself ! " " King Brian is a man of great piety , as his works demonstrate . How fortunate we are to live beneath his protection and see him march in the name of Christ against the hea-then ! " Guaire of Aidne whispered behind his hand to Ruanaid of Delbna , " Was n't there some scandal a time back about this Brian Boru and the monasteries ? " Ruanaid shrugged . " I seem to remember hearing of it , but apparently all is forgiven now . It was something about manuscripts , some rare books that he spirited out of the country .. . I forget how it went . But you always hear tales . " Guaire nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came down here , that we would be met by an army and all taken hostage ; then I heard from another source that we were to be murdered before the first night was over . Instead we are treated like members of the king 's own tribe , and I 've never been better fed in my ... damn it , man , get your knife out of that pork ! I had it first ! " There seemed no limit to the food , a point not lost on the princes of Connacht , where times and cattle were lean . The roast ox and mutton customarily eaten in the wintertime were augmented by quantities of summer food , fowl and fish and cheese of every description , and such delicacies as salmon with woodruff and platters of scallops and periwinkles . Bowls of stirabout and clotted cream were set on every table , and the fragrance of bacon and sausage fought for supremacyp390with the sweet opulence of mead and the heady tang of beer . A year 's storage in the cool souterrains beneath Kincora were served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men looked at one another goggle-eyed . Into such a scene came the new seanchai of the Dal Cais , a man chosen after long deliberation to replace old Aed . A distinguishedollamh of poets , he bore the proud name of Liag MacLiag , in honor of his father who had been a great poet before him . His appearance fitted his calling . Fine-featured , with a high forehead and a mane of fair hair , he paced solemnlyalong in Brian 's cortege , admiring everything with the dreamy detachment of a maker of songs . MacLiag was very much aware that , as a poet , his honor-price was the equal of a king 's , and he bowed to no man save Brian Born . Brian had welcomed MacLiag with a magnificent speech in the banquet hall , in which he called attention to the fact that MacLiag had once been court poet to Teigue 0 Kelly of Connacht . " We are fortunate that the flower of Irish art and wisdom comes such distances to bloom at Kincora , " Brian said . " My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructor and counselor , comes to us originally from a kingdomnot known for its friendship with the Dalcassians . But all men are welcome here "  --  he looked meaningfully at the Connachtmen  --  " andall who give me their allegiance are richly rewarded . " On a fair bright day when the sun shone unclouded from its rise to its setting , and the grass was untouched by so much as a sparkle of frost , Brian escorted his guests to the gates of the fortress to view the ingathering of a vast tribute of cows from Leinster . MacLiag quickly composed a poem of praise , and at its close Brian turned to the poet and laid a hand on his shoulder . " Well said , MacLiag ! But wealth in cattle is nothing compared to the wealth of a poet 's talent . In possessing the bard MacLiag , Kincora already has treasure enough  --  we need no more . All the cattle you see there are yours , poet . "  |p391It  was worth it all , just to see the expressions on the faces turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unpleasant confrontation with his treasurer and a careful computation of the cost of the gesture , Brian allowed himself the luxury of a small regret , expressed only to Padraic . " The nobles will go back to Connacht with their fighting spirit considerably thinned , " he said , " for every time they think of me they will think of wealth they can not match or hope to prevail against , and a generosity they would like to share in . I wish that both were as great as they think . " He took a drink from his cup and stared gloomily at the row of figures written on the tablet before him . " Perhaps you could have accomplished more by giving the cattle to the Connachtmen themselves ? " Brian shook his head . " You ca n't buy friends , Padraic . Such a gesture would have told them I have a weak defense or a guilty conscience , and I would n't want to give either impression . A statesman must usually go after a thing sideways , rather like catching a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never send that many good cattle out of Munster ! " On the final night of High Feasting , Brian brought to life another of the traditions from Ireland 's poetic past . Heralds moved through the chambers and the compound , announcinga bardic duel in the banquet hall after Evensong . " Every prince who has brought a seanchai in his retinue is invited to make an entry for the competition , and the winner will be chosen by acclamation . All are invited to attend , lords and ladies alike . " Kincora was magic that night . Great logs burned on the hearth and the air was sweet with the perfume of heated wine . The courtiers wore their most elegant clothing and their finest kidskin slippers ; the ladies outshone them all with veils of gilt-threaded silk draped bewitchingly about their heads and shoulders . Even Emer , who was little more than a child , with uncovered hair as a token of her virginity , wore a glittering swath of veiling draped across her budding breasts.  |p392Brian  looked at her critically . How could a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to seek out her sister Sabia , and finally located herI ! i half-hidden behind a screen , laughing with that laughter which a daughter does not share with her father . She was leaning against the shoulder of Cian mac Molloy , the young Owenacht prince of Desmond on his first visit to the court of his dead father 's former enemy . One glance told Brian there was no room for him in the world these two had lately found . " Did you want something , my lord ? " Sabia asked sharply , looking at Brian with her mother 's violet eyes . Brian felt a return of the old clumsiness , the awareness of himself as an unwelcome intruder , a violator of secrets . He was never comfortable around Sabia . " No , nothing , " he said curtly , turning away before he could stain his own reputation for hospitality . Then he paused and looked back , intending to warn her with his expression that a king 's daughter must alwaysobserve the proprieties , but she had already forgotten about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool of Cian 's adoring eyes . Brian stalked away from them and ran directly into the abbotof Terryglass , to their mutual confusion . After an assortment of apologies , Brian indicated the Owenacht prince , still absorbed in conversation with Sabia . " Tell me , Celechair , have you ever seen an uglier youth than that one ? " he asked , gesturing toward Cian . Celechair looked at the well-built , handsome young man , admiring his high color and intelligent brow . " Ugly , uncle ? " " You do n't think so ? Look again , and you 'll see that the fellowhas a vacant stare and a weak mouth . I despise a weak mouth ! " Brian walked away briskly , leaving a puzzled Celechair to regard Cian in bafflement . The competition of the seanchaitlie began . One by one , the storytellers of southern Ireland stood in the place of honor besideBrian 's High Seat and spread their shining talents for all to see . The legends came alive again in Kincora that night . The panorama of courtships and cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heartsong of Irish memory and myth were retold to a spellbound audience , as each bard drew on his utmost skill to win his audience . The polished voices rang like musical instruments in the hall , evoking tears or laughter at will . Only once did Brian interrupt the contest . Kevin of Ennis had risen to sing of Cuchullain , that greatest of heroes , and had chosen to tell of the mighty warrior 's ultimate destruction by treachery and magic . As he was describing the wounded but defiant Cuchullain binding himself to a pillar of stone while the cursed demonic crows circled above him and his attackersapproached to take his head , Brian leaped to his feet and raised a voice like thunder in the hall . He stood with his two arms outstretched , as if he would hold back the very darkness , and glared furiously at the storyteller from Ennis . " Enough , seanchai ! " he commanded . " Sing no tales of defeatin my hall ; stories of doom are not welcome at Kincora ! My people must be fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of defeat . Do not commemorate tragedy , or it will reach a dark hand out of the past and strike us down again ! " Sing to me of glory , Kevin of Ennis ! Tell us that we can live , lest we be too quick to accept death . Tell us that we have a chance at happiness , lest we learn to expect only sorrow and live uncomplainingly in its shadow . Do not pander to our Celtic melancholy , or we may think it is a normal condition and that we deserve nothing more than tears and grief . " Tell us that we are strong , seanchai , that we may help each other . Tell us that we are valuable , that we may cherish each other . Tell us that life and love and victory are possible ! " The princes of Connacht rode back , afterward , to their own kingdoms . Each carried with him the memory of the king of Munster , and the enchantment of his court . Each man wondered , in his inmost heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were ever forced to face him in battle . The waters of the Shannon pushed gently against the hastilyerected stone-and-timber barrier that ran from Connachtp394to Meath , seeking a way through it . The rocks shifted , slightly ; the logs moved and swung around , the water surged forward . Bit by bit the causeway disintegrated . The Connachtmenstood on the western bank and watched , but upon the orders of their princes they did nothing to repair it . In the spring Brian 's ships once more sailed north , unimpeded , to Lough Ree . Malachi was crimson-necked with rage . " The king of Munsterhas sent the annual tribute to the Ard Ri , right on time and correct to the last cow ! Every bale of wool is scrupulously accounted for , and every sack of grain is numbered . The arroganceof the man is appalling ! He defies me on every front , and yet is perfectly correct in fulfilling his obligations under the Law ! " " More tribes support him this spring than last , " he was warned . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The peoplerespect me and I 've treated them well ; I 'm a good Christian , I 've fought as well as Brian Boru and won fine victories ... " " They say in the countryside that Boru is champion of Irelandagainst the Northmen , " he was told . " I 've fought the Northmen too ! " Malachi protested . " But it is Brian Boru the poets sing of in the halls , " he was reminded . " Sometimes I wish I were n't a Christian , " Malachi mutteredunder his breath , out of the hearing of the priests . " It would give me such satisfaction to have Brian Boru 's head hanging at my belt . I wonder ... " He tented his fingers and closed his eyes , seeing visions behind them . Malachi attacked Connacht as a warning against their apparentlyincreasing affiliation with Munster . Refugees streamed down from the north and Brian emptied the storehousesof Thomond to feed and clothe them . King Conor of Connacht sent messengers to Kincora , to report on the Ard Ri 's treachery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pillage of his most loyal province by the High King . " In Meath and in Munster , the two kings concentrated , each upon the other . Brian thought of Malachi , the rank he held , and the opportunity it represented . Malachi thought of Brian . Bloody thoughts that echoed from the ancient Celtic days of head-hunting , and drove him to his knees in the confessional . But they did not go away , those thoughts . " We will meet at last , Malachi Mor and I , " Brian said , drawing the swordbelt tight around his muscular body . He smiled at his officers , assembled with him in the joint camp they shared with the allies of Connacht . West of the camp , in the lap of the Shannon , Brian 's fleet waited , shields overlappingthe sides in the Norse fashion , crimson crosses freshly painted on the sails . The foot soldiers who had accompanied the boats , trotting tirelessly along the bank of the river , had had their rest and were preparing themselves for the march eastward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the heather . Princes on horseback cantered up and down the lines , issuing orders or merely presenting themselves to be admiredby the warriors of their tribes . Their command was nominal at best . This was Brian 's army , guided by his will , shaped by his hand ; at his order , the random Celtic fighting formation could be transformed swiftly into a flying wedge , a hollow square any configuration and fighting style that the situation might require . " Are you going to call out the Ard Ri for single combat ? " Padraic asked eagerly , standing beside Brian to readjust thep396brooch that held his cloak . Padraic never believed that Brian  --  or his body servant  --  could pin the massive gold badge of kingship properly . The sharpened spike must be worn pointing upward at just the proper angle to the shoulder , to protect the king from any man so foolish as to attempt throttling him from the rear . Brian , who usually rejected such ministrations and dressed himself , had laughed at Padraic about it  --  " Who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but Padraic had taken it upon himself as a compulsion , and did not feel right in his mind about the king 's safety until he had seen to the brooch 's pinning with his own blunt fingers . He settled it more firmly in the cloth , nodded in satisfaction , and stepped back . " Will you ? " he repeated , just as Laoghaire the Red asked in the same breath , " Will you take female hostages , Brian ? " The king looked over their heads , his gaze sweeping the camp . The nearest Connacht chieftain was conferring with his officers just a little distance from them . Brian turned his back toward the man and spoke away from the wind , so that his voice reached only the ears of his own men gathered about him . " I do n't intend to fight the Ard Ri at all , " Brian told them in a low voice , shifting his body so that his broad shoulders blocked the view of their astonished faces from the Connachtmen . Before they could question him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop an alliance with Connacht as much as is possible under the circumstances , but even that is a secondary consideration . I 'm principally interested in having Malachi see the force of the army I can assemble , and in meeting him personally in a situation where I am certain of numerical superiority . Without the armies of Connacht I could not be sure of that , but today enough men march beneath my banner to make an overwhelming impression on the Ard Ri . " " But if you do n't intend to fight . . . " Conaing protested , bitter disappointment in his voice . " The time has not yet come when I would be willing top397challenge the Ard Ri in life or death combat . I hope it will never be necessary . Today I come only in support of my friend , the king of all Connacht , who has been treated badly . Do you understand ? We 'll sit at a table with Malachi and establishan accord that will pacify both sides  --  for a while  --  and I 'll have an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way . " " I can not believe you would take so many men such a long distance with no intention of a battle ! " man Finn complained . " How can I explain it to my wife if I come home with no loot ? " " We may yet have a battle , " Brian said . " It can never be discounted as a possibility . But I would prefer not ; I would rather have Malachi form the habit of agreeing to my policies under amicable conditions than have to impose my will on him by force . If I attack him , I only encourage someone else to attack me when I am in his place . " Listening , Carroll nodded , a half-smile on his face . The army of Meath was encamped on the eastern shore of the limestone lake known as Lough Ennell . They were gatheredto defend the Ard Ri 's tribal stronghold , Dun na Sciath  --  the Fort of Shields . It stood but a little distance from the water , a timbered fortress snug within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the center of the lake was a dotting of small islands , favorite haunts of Malachi and his court on long summer evenings . This was Meath 's heartland , center of power for the whole tribe of the southern Hy Neill . News of an invading army had struck terror here . The scouts came running hard , breathless with the news . " Born ! " they cried . " He is coming ! " The warriors shouldered their weapons and strapped their shields to their arms . Priests moved among them , giving blessings , offering prayers for victory , promising heaven . On the far shore of the lake a dark line appeared , a sinister black crop growing out of the green fields , advancing over the land like a blight . It seemed to stretch for miles . Its size and its menace were obvious.
