Mr. Taylor  --  David N. Taylor , an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer attached to the Enteric Diseases Branch , Bacterial Diseases Division , of the national Centers for Disease Control , in Atlanta  --  pushed the telephone away and sat for a moment glancing over his notes . Then he gathered them up and walked down the long hall , the fifth-floor hall , to the office of his superior , Dr. Roger A. Feldman , the director of the Bacterial Diseases Division . That was around three o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday , January 28 , 1981 . Dr. Feldman , a tall man with a pepper-and-salt beard , a wide smile , and a riveting eye , was at his desk , and he smiled Dr. Taylor into a chair . Dr. Taylor  --  slim , straight , neatly parted sandy hair , small sandy mustache , steel-rimmed glasses  --  is 33 years old and a product of Kenyon College , Harvard Medical School , and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine . He took out his notes and made his report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an epidemiologist named Frank Holtzhauer , at the Ohio State Department of Health , in Columbus . Holtzhauer was calling for Dr. Thomas Halpin , the state epidemiologist , and his callwas a call for federal help in investigating a perplexing outbreak of gastroenteritis in the town of Steubenville . The outbreak had begun on December 10 with the illness and subsequent hospitalization of a fivemonth-old girl . Since then , in the course of the past six weeks , 12 more cases , both adults and children , had been reported to the local authorities , and it was expected that there were more to come.The nature of the outbreak had been established . The enteritis was bacterial in origin . Laboratory analysis of stool samples of the victims had shown the microorganism involved to be a member of the genus Salmonella and of the species known as S. muenchen . But that was all . There was no other apparent link between the several victims . " Roger listened and smiled and nodded , " Dr. Taylor says . " He asked a couple of questions . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation and for a formal invitation to intervene . But the handwriting was already on the wall . I was going to Steubenville . " Salmonellosis , as the disease caused by the Salmonella organism is properly called , is the most frequent single cause of what is commonlycalled food poisoning . It accounts for at least 25 per cent of the numberless outbreaks of mingled nausea and vomiting , abdominal cramps , diar-rhea and fever that occur in this and every other country every year . Its name commemorates the 19th-cen-tury American pathologist Daniel Elmer Salmon , who first identified the genus , and it is a commemoration of international reach . " Bacteria of the genus Salmonella , " Robert H. Rubin and Louis Weinstein , both of the Harvard Medical School , noted in a 1977 monograph , " are perhaps the most ubiquitous patho-gens in nature , affecting , in a worldwide distribution , not only man and his domestic animals but also reptiles , wild mammals , birds , and even insects . " The usual cause of human salmonellosis is contaminated ( and insufficiently cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chicken , or , particularly , eggs . Other causes include food or drink contaminated by the excreta of infected animals or by tainted equipment . An outbreak in Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital in 1966 was traced to contaminated carmine dye , a diagnostic staining material . The salmonellae are almost as various as they are abundant . Since 1941 , when the Danish bacteriologist Fritz Kauffmann perfected a serotyping technique by which the different salmonellae could be specifically identified , the number of species that make up the genus has grown from a handful to the hundreds . Some 2,200 distinct serotypes are now known . The names of these ( with two or three exceptions ) indicate where they were first isolated  --  S. moscow , for example , and S. Panama , S. miami , S. senegal . Some of these are still found only in their place of discovery , but most have long since achieved a cosmopolitan prevalence . " S. muenchen was n't much of a clue , " Dr. Taylor says . " A really common  --  a relatively localizedserotype can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you where to look , and even what to look for as the source of contamination . But S. muenchen turns up everywhere  --  all over the country , all over the world . Around 350 cases are reported to the CDC every year . So I was prepared for some hard work , for plenty of old-fashioned shoe-leather epidemiology . I should say we were prepared . I had an assistant  --  a fourth-year medical student at Duke who was assigned to the CDC for a term as a sort of intern . A very bright guy named Emmett Schmidt . Emmett and I left the next morning  --  Thursday morning  --  by plane for Pittsburgh . We rented a car there and drove on down to Steubenville . Steubenville is in the eastern part of the state , across the Ohio River from West Virginia . I come from Ohio . I was raised in Columbus . But Steubenville was an Ohio I had never seen before . It 's a mill town  --  a steel town , down in a deep valley , very old and run-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year , the dead of winter , or because most of the mills were barely running and everybody was out of work , but I 've never seen a ore depressing place . It took the heart out of me . " There was a Holiday Inn . We registered there and then drove around to the city Health Department and met some of the people we would be working with . We met Maurice Pizzoferrato , the Steubenville Commissioner of Health , and two state epidemiologists  --  Charlene Steris and Robert Campbell  --  and Janice Schrader , a microbiologist . It was Janice who had determined that the cause of the outbreak was Salmonella , later serotyped in Columbus as S. muenchen . The first thing we learned was that the outbreak was still going on . I 've forgotten just how many new cases there were  --  I did n't keep a daily report card . But I can tell you the total . By the time the outbreak had finally run its course , we had 36 confirmed cases . " Janice Schrader was a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole area , and she was still able to find time to help us every way she could . She was a big help in working out our game plan and getting it into action . She seemed to know just about everybody in town . She was involved , she cared about what had happened . Charlene briefed us on the cases  --  age , sex , date of onset . The incubation period for satmonellosis is about three days . The date of the appearance of symptoms indicates the approximate time of exposure and can often indicate its place and nature . We learned that the outbreak was , on the whole , pretty severe . There is no treatment for salmonellosis . Antibiotics tend to do more harm than good . But 80 percent of the affected children here were sick enough to be hospitalized , and about 65 percent of the adult cases . The age range was enormous . It stretched from a one-month-old boy to a woman of 73 . " We formed two teams . I joined up with Charlene , and Emmett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but start almost from scratch ? to start visiting the households of the patients . I was especially interested in the first two cases reported  --  the 5-month-old girl and a 25-yearold man . That was because the baby 's father  --  a man I 'll call Frank Lowell ? was bosom buddies with the second case , whom I 'll call Gene Russell . And then there was case No. 3 , a close friend of both Lowell and Russell . He was a 27-year-old man I 'll call Paul James . Russell was out of work , but Lowell and James both had jobs on a municipal garbage truck . The three of them had been friends since high school . " My thinking was this : " Young guys , young couples , do things together , so let 's see what the Lowells , the Russells , and the Jameses do for recreation . They all lived in the same neighborhood , down by the river . We decided to start with Mrs. Lowell . It 's easier to talk to the mother of a sick infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adult tends to shrug it off . Mrs. Lowell was sort of typical-27 years old , pretty face , overweight . And very nervous . Her house was old and rundown , but it was scrubbed clean . Not a speck of dust . The baby 's illness seemed to embarrass her , as though it reflected on her as a mother and a housekeeper . She did n't see how a thing like food poisoning could have happened in her house . I asked about formulas , about Christmas or holiday foods . There was a famous outbreak of S. eastbourne that involved contaminated chocolate Christmas candy . I asked about deli meats  --  a notorious vehicle . The Lowells could n't afford to eat in restaurants or patronize delis . During the holidays , they had eaten turkey , ham , and some venison . Gene Russell had shot a deer and dressed it himself at home . They rarely went out . They sometimes played cards with the Jameses and the Russells , or just hung out together . " So Charlene and I moved on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Same kind of household  --  father , mother , twomonth-old boy . Russell was out of work and at home . But this was n't like the Lowell house . These people were relaxed . Mrs. Russell said that she had n't been sick , and neither had the baby , even though later tests showed that both had been infected . And Russell himself was the picture of unconcern : ' Gee , Doc , I do n't know what happened . I got sick , but I feel O.K. now . What do you think it was , Doc ? Could it have been that deer ? I shot it out near an old abandoned dump . But , what the hell , it 's all over now . ' Another dead end . " It was the same with the Jameses , around the corner . James was at work and his wife was at home with two children  --  a boy of five and a daughter of six . James and the boy had been sick , and were treated at the Ohio Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russells , played cards , drank a little beer . Had a ham for Christmas . That was interesting . I had never thought of ham as a holiday food , but everybody around here seemed to eat it at Christmastime . I filed the thought away . " And on we went , from house to house , still fishing , still getting nowhere . But two things did take shape  --  three , including those Christmas-ham dinners . The first thing was that the cases seemed to fall into three groups . There were the blue-collar cases down in the valley . There were a couple of middle-class cases up on the hill , in a neighboring village called Wintersville . And there were some cases in a middle-class neighborhood of a suburb called Mingo Junction . Which , of course , was the reverse of helpful . It simply made things more mysterious . " The other finding was a little more positive . It was only a statistic , but it had the feel of something solid . This was the age breakdown . The largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 and 29 . That group accounted for 28 percent of the cases . But the national average of salmonella outbreaks in that group is just 12 percent . This suggested that something a little different was happening here . Why the prevalence of young adults ? Was there a preponderance of families of young adults in Steubenville ? We decided to find out . So we picked out a set of controls . We selected at random 32 households in the neighborhoods of our established cases and called them up . What was the makeup of the household ? And  --  ahal It was not usual in Steubenville to find a young adult in every family . All our case households included persons aged from 15 to 35 , but only 41 percent of the randomly selected households included persons in that age range . Well , now we had a common denominator . Maybe not the common denominator but a common denominator . The next question was : What do young adults do ? Where do they go ? Bars . Fast-food places . We went back to shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These people still did n't have any haunts in common . " There were two cases up in Wintersville . Both were students  --  a 17-year-old boy and an 18-yearold girl  --  at the local Catholic high school . The boy was in the hospital . The girl had been treated in the emergency room and sent home . We talked to the boy , and he gave us the story of his life . Video games . Pizza parlors . A few private parties . We talked to the girl 's parents . The mother had a theory : her daughter had been poisoned by frozen king crab . I thought of the Lowells and the Russells and the Jameses . They had probably never even heard of king crab . And then the girl 's mother seemed to finish things off . She said that her daughter and the boy in the hospital moved in entirely different circles and hardly knew each other . " I 'm going to go back a few days now , " Dr. Taylor continued . " The morning that Emmett and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Feldman , in the Bacterial Diseases Division , and he showed me a yellow office-memo slip . It said , ' S. muenchen , Michigan . ' It was dated about a week earlier . Roger told me what it meant : Michigan had reported an outbreak of S. muenchen and wanted to know if the CDC had had any similar reports . Roger said he had told them about Steubenville . He would pass my reports along to them . O.K. So on the way back down the hill to the Holiday Inn after that wasted day in Wintersville , I got to thinking about that Michigan outbreak . S. muenchen is common enough , but still . . . Back at the motel , I called a man I knew in the Michigan State Department of Health named Harry McGee . Harry told me they had 20-odd cases , all with onset dates much like ours here , and all were in Lansing . Not in East Lansing , the university town , but in Lansing , the blue-collar auto town . They had n't a clue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nine or ten were babies  --  infants  --  which meant that they were in households that included young adults . 1 began to get a little excited . I thanked Harry and called Roger Feldman . I told him the situation here , that we were stymied . The people were getting tired of us . The health commissioner wanted the case solved and cleared up and ended  --  he had all the eating places in town on his back . I suggested that a trip to Lansing and a look at those very similar cases might give us a new perspective . Or something . Roger said no . He said to stay where we were . He said that the answer was there and that we 'd find it . And to let him know when we did . That was on Thursday , February 5 . It was snowing . The charm of motel life fades very quickly . Emmett and I were homesick for our wives , who kept asking when we were ever coming home . We went out in the snow and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we went back to the motel . We stared at our data , turning it this way and that , until about 2 a.m . And the only item that meant a thing was all those young adults . " We started out the next morning on a new tack . I still had ham on my mind  --  those holiday ham dinners . So we decided to settle the question one way or another . Commissioner Pizzoferrato lent us one of his department 's sanitarians , and with him as our guide we undertook a tour of the city 's meat markets . We picked up samples of different kinds of ham at each place , and Janice Schrader would culture them for possible salmonellae . Most of the markets were ethnic  --  Polish , Italian , Greek . Steubenville is that kind of town . The proprietors were a little suspicious . They did n't want to get involved in food poisoning . But we got what we wanted . And , all in all , it was a pretty dull tour . There was one incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we were leaving , a young woman came in . Pretty but bedraggled . She was crying , her eye makeup was smeared and she was acting strange . Stoned . Spaced out . Something . The proprietor went over to her and soothed her , and she left . It was sort of sad , and we talked about it on the way to the next market . Was she drunk ? Or was she on drugs ? The sanitarian said something about a relationship between unemployment and drugs and alcohol . Looking around Steubenville those crippled mills , all that depression  --  I could believe him . Anyway , we finished up and took our samples to Janice . And that , as it turned out , was the end of the ham idea . The cultures all were negative . " Emmett and I had dinner that night with Janice . We ate at an Italian place she knew about , and for once it was n't bad , and we sat there afterward , drinking coffee and shooting the breeze about what the heck was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families  --  the Lowells and the Russells and the Jameses . In case you 've forgotten , the outbreak was still not over . We were still getting new cases , and all the cases , new and old , were being monitored once a week . Their stool samples came to Janice , and she cultured them . Well , Janice said we might be interested to know that one of the cases had just been cleared . That was Mrs. Russell . For the first time , her weekly sample was negative . The rest of her family was still positive , and so were the Jameses and the Lowells . It was interesting . We wondered why her . Janice said that maybe Mrs. Russell was also pregnant . Maybe that had something to do with it . Then we broke up , and Emmett and I went back to the motel . I remember that Emmett called his wife and they talked and talked , and he mentioned the woman in the meat market and they talked about drugs . When he hung up , we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaaludes and things Like that  --  drugs in capsules that could get contaminated in processing or packaging . It was a thought . " It still seemed like a good idea in the morning . Janice had mentioned Mrs. Russell , and she seemed as good a place as any to start . We went around to the Russell place right after breakfast , at about nine o'clock . Mrs. Russell received us . Russell was still in bed  --  and why not ? He was out of work and it was a dismal morning . We asked Mrs. Russell once again about food , about mixes , about condiments . We did a thorough kitchen inventory , and it was the kind of kitchen you would n't be surprised to find any kind of contamination in . These were real easygoing people  --  not like Mrs. Lowell . But that was all just thrashing around . Finally , I got down to business and asked her if she or anybody in the family was taking any kinds of drugs . She said , ' You mean like medicine ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illicit drugs ? Like , say , ' ludes ? ' Oh , no  --  certainly not . ' Then there was a funny kind of silence . Then she said , ' Well , Gene and I and most of our friends , we do smoke a little pot when we 're hanging out together . But I stopped last week . I mean , I 'm pregnant , so I thought I 'd better . ' Pot ? Marijuana ? I was thinking capsules  --  swallowing something contaminated . Pot was smoking . I did n't know what to think . And then Russell came strolling into the living room . I guess he 'd waked up and heard us talking . He was very cool , very relaxed . He said , ' Sure , we smoke a little pot . What else is there to do in this town ? ' I was still trying to think , to adjust . I asked him very carefully if he happened to have any marijuana on hand ? if I could have a sample for laboratory analysis . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Sure . ' He said , ' Man , I 'll roll you a joint . ' I told him just a sample for the lab would do . But I was aware of what he was doing . To him and his wife , Emmett and I were some kind of Feds . He wanted to get me involved . He wanted to get me neutralized . Anyway , he just shrugged and laughed , and went off somewhere and came back with a couple of grams in an envelope  --  about enough for one joint . Emmett and I exchanged a look . We finally , at last , had something concrete . It was a weird idea . I had never heard of marijuana as a vehicle for salmonella . Nobody had . But it was an idea . It was concrete , and I had it in my hand . " Our next move was going to be a little more difficult . Russell had nothing much to lose  --  he was unemployed , and who cared if he smoked a little pot ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lowells and the Jameses were city employees . It was going to be hard to get anything out of them . I decided that our best move was through Russell . I explained to him that our interest in marijuana had nothing to do with the law . Emmett and I were n't any kind of police . We had no intention of getting him or anybody else in trouble . We were only trying to get at the source of the outbreak . We rapped like that for a little while , and then I said that we would need to talk to the other cases , including his friends the Lowells and the Jameses . I wondered if he would try to sort of pave the way for us . Would he mind calling Mrs. Lowell ? Be glad to . He went to the phone and called her . He was very good , very persuasive . You remember that she was a very nervous , worrying kind of woman . But she agreed to see us . We went right over . She was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she had ever come to a drug bust . But she was making an effort to be calm and sophisticated . She said , well , yes , they did smoke pot . She said , well , yes , they did have some in the house . She went off and came back with about two grams in a plastic bag . She said it came from the same guy that the Jameses and the Russells bought their pot from . She asked me if I really thought that the outbreak was caused by pot . I said it seemed to be a possibility . ' Well , ' she said , ' I 'm not really surprised . I thought this batch had a kind of funny smell . ' That made me smile . But I really wanted to shout . A possibility , of course , was all it was . But it was a possibility that seemed to fit in very nicely with that preponderance of young adults . We were cooking . We were really cooking . " But down here in this blue-collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one neighborhood , only one part of the outbreak . There was Mingo Junction , and there was Wintersville , up on the hill . When we made our first round of house calls , we had talked to a young woman at Mingo Junction  --  Linda Somethingor-Other . She was the one confirmed case there , but her brother and her boyfriend were both subclinical cases  --  positive but asymptomatic . Linda was 21 , a salesgirl in a nut shop by day and a dancing teacher evenings . She never had any reason to go down to the valley . She took sick on December 28 . She lived at home but very seldom ate there . She told us she lived on tacos , submarine sandwiches , and such . When we finished up with Mrs. Lowell , we went out to Mingo and ran Linda down again and had a talk . Pot ? She said she never used it . Her brother did , though , and so did her friend . She thought she could get us a sample from her friend . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wintersville . We got nowhere with the two high-school kids . We had to be careful , and they were n't telling : getting caught using pot meant expulsion from school . But I talked with a counselor at the school , and he told me that while our two kids moved in different circles , the circles they moved in were very far from the best . We met Linda and her friend that evening , and they had a nice sample for us . I do n't know how Emmett and I got through Saturday night . We were really keyed up . I called Janice on Sunday morning and told her what we had , and she agreed to meet us at her lab . Very quietly . This was ticklish business at this point  --  we did n't know how the Health Department would react . On Monday afternoon , Janice told us that preliminary results showed evidence of contaminated pot  --  all three samples . By Tuesday , it was definite . She had cultured salmonellae from the samples , and they were salmonellae of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. muenchen . On Wednesday , Janice went on to make it certain : our marijuana samples were definitely contaminated with S. muenchen . But on Tuesday morning the C/2 finding was enough . I called Roger Feldman , and he said , ' Well , well ! I 'll be damned ! ' " Maurice Pizzoferrato had very much the same reaction . Only more so . Roger was naturally pleased that we had solved the problem , and as a professional he was very much interested that we had found a new vehicle for salmonellae . But Maurice ! Maurice was euphoric . He had been getting very edgy , very impatient . His lab was tied up , his people were on call to us , and all the eating places in town were on his phone every day andafraid of hearing the worst . And , of course , the press was pressing . Marijuana was an absolutely perfect answer . It took him entirely off the hook . Illicit drugs were no responsibility of his . He wanted the world to know what we had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Roger , when I asked him for instructions , agreed . Emmett and I worked up a statement , and the conference was set for ten o'clock on Wednesday morning , February 11 , in Maurice ' office at the Health Department . They even had me sitting in Maurice ' own big chair , at his own big desk . " It was my debut in this sort of thing . All the media were there  --  the local newspaper , the local radio , the local television and the stringers for the wire services . I read our statement . I told them that the source of the outbreak was n't water , it was n't any eating place , it was n't any food . I told them  --  and this is from our prepared statement ? ' Our most important lead suggests that a noncommercial product with an unknown distribution is the source of this salmonella . We have tested samples of marijuana associated with three different cases , and we have found the identical salmonella which has been isolated from the ill persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson Countyhas become contaminated with salmonella and represents the primary vehicle of transmission for the illness . ' I told them that having diarrhea caused by salmonella did n't necessarily mean that the person was a user of marijuana . Many of our cases , I said , were infected indirectly from a person who was a silent carrier , or from environmental sources . The salmonella was in the marijuana . When a marijuana smoker rolled a cigarette , his hands became contaminated , and when he put the cigarette in his mouth his lips became contaminated . Then a touch or a kiss or any sort of contact could spread the infection . I said we did n't know yet just how heavily contaminated the marijuana was  --  actually , it turned out to be very heavily contaminated  --  but even a light contamination would be enough to make a susceptible person sick . And not only that . Pot decreases the gastric acid , and gastric acid is an important defense against infections of all kinds . Regular pot smokers are especially susceptible to infection . Then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our statement : ' To substantiate our theory that marijuana is the culprit , it is most important that we continue to test marijuana samples from the area . If it were a commercial product , we could just pull it off the shelves and test it but that is not possible with marijuana . We therefore need the community to help us by allowing us to test additional marijuana samples . People may drop off their samples either at the Jefferson County Center for Alcoholism and Drug Abuse . . . or the samples may be brought directly to the Steubenville City Health Department . Because we think this is a major health risk , we are testing marijuana free and anonymously . Your sample will be given a number . . . And so on . The police had agreed to look the other way for a day or two . Then came the questions . I did the best I could . It was really very exciting . A big story . And not only locally . Both the wire services carried it . It was n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marijuana . That gave it a contemporary touch . " That was our last day in Steubenville . There was no reason for Emmett and me to stay on for the windup of the investigation . We flew back to Atlanta that afternoon . I had a day at home  --  Thursday , February 12 ? and then on Friday Roger sent me off to Michigan . I was n't exactly eager to leave , and yet , of course , I wanted to go . I felt that Steubenville was only one side of the coin . I did n't feel we had absolutely proved our case . What wanted was what I had wanted before  --  to do a good case-control study . Our studies in Steubenville were n't really precise . The supreme court for an epidemiological problem is a case-control study , and I wanted that supreme-court verdict . As I said , my contact in Michigan was Harry McGee , of the Michigan State Department of Health . Nothing had really changed in Lansing since Harry and I last talked . There was a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak was still unknown . But now , after Steubenville , we had a lead to work with . The study ; went like this : We selected 34 households to serve as controls . These households matched the case households in neighborhood and in general social and economic status , and they had much the same prevalence of young children and young adults . The one crucial difference was that the controls were households in which there had been no diarrheal illness for at least two months . We did our interviews in person . People respond to a personal visit with trust . We asked a comprehensive set of questions . We asked about restaurant meals . About deli foods . About alcohol . And then about marijuana . The results were very satisfactory . The case households used marijuana more than three lames as often as the control households . We also collected eight samples of marijuana from six households . Only one of them was positive for salmonella  --  for S. muenchen . But that was enough . " I went back to Atlanta feeling very pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The final reports from Steubenville were in . The public appeal had brought in 54 new samples of marijuana , and five of them were positive for S. rnuenchen . Then came some totally unexpected news : There had been two outbreaks of S. muenchen gastroenteritis that were more or less coincident with Steubenville and Lansing  --  one in Alabama , involving two cases , and another in Georgia , in and around Atlanta , involving 21 cases . When the health people there saw our first Steubenville report , they sat up in a hurry . They went back to their cases and interviewed them all over again and collected some samples of marijuana and analyzed them , and the results were positive for S. muenchen contamination . The contamination in every instance was very considerable . It was almost incredible-4 million organisms to a gram of marijuana . That was so high that it enabled us to make a very reasonable assumption . This was that the contamination could not have occurred by accident  --  by contamination on the hands of the processors . It must have occurred either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizer , or by contamination during drying or storage  --  or by direct adulteration of the marijuana with dried manure , to increase the weight and therefore increase the profits . We generally favor the last hypothesis . A good reason for this theory was that S. muenchen was not the only contaminating pathogen found in the marijuana . All the samples also showed the presence of such organisms as Staphylococcus epidermidis , E. roll , K. pneumoniae , Ps. aeruginosa , and Group D Streptococci , which would also be present in manure . Our only disappointment was that we were never able to determine where the stuff came from . The Drug Enforcement Administration of the Department of Justice estimated that in 1980 about 75 percent of the marijuana consumed in the United States came from Colombia , about 10 percent from Jamaica , and about 8 percent from Mexico and that the rest is grown locally . Locally grown marijuana is consumed locally , and Mexican marijuana is consumed largely in the Southwest . So we can assume that our marijuana came from either Colombia or Jamaica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
