txt As an evening bugle blares , a seven-man presidential honor guard is lowering the green-and-white flag here in Nigeria 's new capital city . But the president is n't here . Neither is the government . In fact , despite its official designation last October as the capital of this West African country , Abuja is little more than a collection of clearings in the bush . Its only major public building is the unfinished concrete shell of the presidential palace . The palace complex  --  designed with such amenities as two swimming pools , a mosque , a chapel and a nuclear-bomb shelter ? by now was supposed to be housing President Shehu Shagari , his two legal wives , two mistresses , and as many as nine visiting heads of state . Construction of the capital , which once represented the hopes for the future of the 23-year-old nation , has come to symbolize the dejection of the present . Abuja was planned during the heady days of soaring petroleum prices in the 1970s. but now has fallen far down on the list of priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more concerned these days with halting a plunge in oil revenues and keeping the country 's economy from collapsing . Undercutting OPEC The flagging fortunes also have spawned disruptive strikes , student riots and rampant crime , and called attention to high-level corruption in the former British colony , whose 90 million people occupy an area slightly larger than Texas and Oklahoma . Among the signs of corruption : two suspicious fires that have destroyed records of government investigations . Crime , says Ben Lawrence , editor of the Lagos Evening Times , is " part of a get-richquick mania that started with the oil boom . We were trying to live like the Arabs . But things will never be what they used to be . ' Lagos , on the Atlantic coast about 250 miles - southwest of Abuja , is Nigeria 's largest city and still the real , if unofficial , seat of government . And observers there say economic and social upheaval throughout the country has helped forge its recent maverick role in the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . In a bid to increase cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month undercut other cartel members by $5.50 a barrel . This month 's tortured OPEC negotiations in London , finally resolved with a pricing agreement Monday , were prolonged by Nigeria 's refusal to raise its prices even - 50 cents a barrel to fall in line with the new pricing structure . Import Troubles Less-populous OPEC nations , lacking Nigeria 's debt problems and the need for imrtiediate cash , still consider Nigeria the weak link in the cartel . And they figure that if any member breaks ranks again to meet price cutting by non-OPEC nations , it is likely to be Nigeria . Experts question whether Nigeria would be successful over the long term in increasing oil revenues by undercutting world prices . Even a rise in oil exports to 1.2 million barrels a day , nearly double last month 's rate , at current prices would produce only $5.6 billion in 1983 revenues . That is well below 1980 's record $10.4 billion , and less than a third of the 1983 amount that had been projected in a Nigerian five-year plan outlined at the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . And since the five-year plan was instituted , it has postponed a $1 billion subway system for Lagos , sharply curtailed support to the nation 's 19 provincial states and slowed work on the new capital . For Nigeria-based industry , problems also have intensified . Using an unwieldy licensing process , the government is trying to slash imports to $900 million a month from about $2 billion a month in 1982 . Even companies that obtain the necessary licenses have trouble getting govegment letters of credit , which also are required for importing goods . A Volkswagen assembly plant had to be closed for a time last month because parts could n't be brought into the country . Peugeot , the French car maker , needs to import $300 million in parts to keep operating . Further , Peugeot has threatened to shut down one of its plants soon If the $200 million debt Nigeria owes the company isp't settled . The money is locked up in Nigeria 's central bank . Smaller companies are having similar troubles . One Nigerian trading and Indus- trial concern at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several oil-services companies have been forced to make deep cuts in employment . A hatchery closed because it could n't import chicks to replace the birds slaughtered to feed Nigerians . Foreign banks have held back credit from the government and most of Nigeria 's companies until the country forks over some of its $5 billion to $6 billion in unpaid trade bills . Rocks for Motorists The corporate importation problems , especially , have a paradoxical ring in a nation where impoverished looking children still sell European watches and Japanese calculators at intersections . " Every company confronts a raw-material problem , " says one banker in Lagos . " Only the strongest companies will survive . " The constriction of public funds distributed to the states has rippled quickly through the countryside . The state of Benue has proposed cutting salaries for civil servants about in half . Teacher strikes prompted by previous pay cuts , and dockworker stoppages , have proliferated . The university at Maidugun , in the nation 's northeastern corner , has been closed for weeks after student unrest , and students in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been without water or electricity for months . Around Nigeria , street crime seems to be growing . Youths often throw rocks at passing motorists at night from footpaths that cross the highway . The road from Zaria to Kano . towns in the north , is dreaded by taxi drivers . An attack on the vice president 's house in Lagos earlier this year by armed robbers dramatized the severity of the problem for many Nigerians . " We do n't like the phrase ' law and order . ' but it is becoming an issue here , " says B.O. Clark , Nigeria 's former ambassador to the United Nations . Some argue that the economic disruption is devastating only in the larger cities , because 70% of the population still lives in villages , isolated from the worries of bankers and oil executives . Many urban workers , however , send money home to their families in rural areas . So rises in unemployment do have an indirect effect in the countryside . Here in Abuja , the economic slowdown is tangible , even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to import 47 different items needed to finish the palace . Contractors on various projects have n't been paid in months . Yet somehow , billions of dollars have been pumped into this area , with little more to show for the expense than the daily flag ceremonies . An official at Strabag Bau AG. a West German contractor that is building a 25-mile-long stretch of expressway , says his company has received less than 15% of its payment for the work done over the past 13 months . The company was supposed to build a 10-lane highway ; the plan has been scaled down to four lanes , only two of which have been completed . Like many companies operating in Nige- ria , Strabag Bau is hanging on here hoping for a turnaround . " Of course companies have a lot of investments here , " says an official . " You ca n't walk out at the first sign of rough weather . It 's like abandoning a ship you just paid $30 million for . " He adds : " We hope to weather the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't based on facts . " Nigeria 's capital-building project also is supposed to include a national assembly , a library and museum , government ministries and apartment houses and hotels  --  built around the centerpiece of the presidential palace . Xenophobic Tensions It 's estimated that companies here have laid off 25% to 50% of their employees , both Nigerians and foreigners . Senators from the nation 's states had expected to move here a year ago , but one contractor figures the capital wo n't be ready for at least another 10 years . " I broke my crystal ball last week , " says another contractor . The mood here has turned against foreign workers , most of whom are in Nigeria illegally . Some Abuja laborers have scrawled " Ghana Go " on the palace walls ; more than half the estimated two million foreigners in the country until recently were from Ghana , just up the coast from Nigeria . Xenophobic tensions are worse in Lagos . where most of the illegals lived . Last Jan. 17 the government ordered that foreigners obtain working papers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent weekend Nigerians swept through a beach shanty town in Lagos , tearing down hundreds of flimsy dwellings that had been occupied by the foreign workers . Corruption seems to be a bigger contributor to Nigeria 's woes , and the government has launched several investigations into charges of criminal activity by officials . Burning Evidence But a fire destroyed many of the records in Abuja after the administrator in charge of capital construction and five of his aides were accused of embezzling more than $20 million . The men have been arrested and held without bail . The firebug has cropped up elsewhere , conveniently protecting officials charged with corruption . An investigation of the Nigerian External Telecommunications Ministry , which regulates wire and phone services , was interrupted in January when a fire burned records being kept in a Lagos skyscraper . The fire destroyed much of the 32-story structure , the tallest in West Africa , and a team of American insurance investigators detected evidence of bombs on three of its floors . Some observers say the crackdown on foreigners and the Investigations started by President Shagari 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national election expected in July or August . Opposition leaders have charged his National Party with economic mismanagement . Chief Obafemi Abolowo , the Unity Party 's candidate for president , calls Nigeria " bankrupt " and accuses members of selves at t ' s expense . Adenemo Kadin , a worker in Abuja , has been told his job will be phased out in June . and he blames government mismanagement of oil revenues . Mr. Kadiri lives here with his wife and two children , but sends as much money as he can to his father 's farm in the southern state of Bendel . Land Without Polls It 's clear , however , that much of the populace is n't touched by such opinions . Near Abuja stands a small village of grass-covered huts , where women walk to the river daily to collect water in earthenware pots . Lambs , chickens and children run free in the dry grass . Politics seems far away . President Shagari is viewed in Nigeria as a heavy favorite to win , although the political scene often is difficult to fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there reliable counts of registered voters . Indeed , concern over the possibility of election fraud involving the illegal foreigners may have been one reason for their recent expulsion . " It is only the second election in 17 years and the first one with tough economic circumstances after the oil boom . " says one Western diplomat . " A lot of new ground is being plowed . " The two major opposition parties have n't been able to agree on a united ticket , and tribal and personal loyalties seem to favor the incumbents . An aide to Mr. Shagari argues that even those people hurt by the sagging economy wo n't blame the government as long as they feel each section of the country and each tribe is getting its fair share of current revenues . He maintains that unrest in Nigeria has n't matched that of several years ago , when a military regime distributed revenues in a manner many people viewed as uneven . Conscious of this history , the Shagari government carefully has earmarked grants for different regions , most recently in a $300 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out of the recession , but it 's a world-wide phenomenon , " says Ibezim Chukwumerije , deputy national secretary of Mr. Shagari 's National Party . " We do n't think the electorate will punish us for that . "
