But always one step back , as a U.N . commission heads for Iran <P> We are not privy to news and consequently are unaware of what efforts , if any , are being exerted on our behalf . There 's no news about our status . <P> So wrote William Keough Jr. , one of the 50 Americans being held hostage in Iran , in a letter to his family in Waltham , Mass . It is one of the cruel and bizarre aspects of the hostages ' long ordeal that they probably have no notion of how the search for a means to free them has dominated the nation 's concerns ever since they were taken prisoner on Nov. 4 . <P> This search seemed headed for yet another climax last weekend as a special five-man United Nations commission arrived in Tehran to hear the grievances of Iran 's new rulers against the regime of the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi . Arranging this mission took more than a week of feverish diplomatic activity , as officials at times worked round the clock . Their efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to materialize , and hints of progress that suddenly dissolved . <P> Every detail of the U.N . mission was haggled over . At a packed Manhattan news conference , U.N . Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim announced the formation of what he very carefully termed " a commission of inquiry " that would " undertake a fact-finding mission . " This appeared to mean that the group was not to be a tribunal , something that the Iranians had requested and the U.S. had strongly opposed . Waldheim added that the commission " will complete its work as soon as possible and submit its report to the Secretary-General . " <P> Will the hostages then be freed ? A fortnight ago , officials in both Washington and New York seemed confident that the release was part of a package deal , definitely linked to the formation of the U.N . commission . The only uncertainty , it seemed , was whether the release would come when the U.N . commission was formed or after it finished its work . Iran 's new President , Abolhassan Banisadr , appeared to have agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say so in writing , he denied that there was any connection at all between the U.N . hearings and the release of the hostages . Some optimistic officials in Washington and at the U.N . insisted that such a package was still being worked on-it is " a gentleman 's agreement , " said one of the U.N . envoys - and that Banisadr had to sound tough because he still lacks control over the young militants who hold the hostages . Said Waldheim , in his office during an interview with TIME last Friday : " I am confident that we shall find a solution , though nobody can say when . " And a senior State Department aide summed up the latest impasse by saying , " We are now in a dance where it 's two steps forward , one step backward . Before that , it was always one step sideways . " <P> Both sides were relying heavily on the skill and shrewdness of the five distinguished U.N . envoys . Much care had gone into choosing them : former Venezuelan Ambassador to the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delegate Mohammed Bedjaoui , Syrian Career Diplomat Adib Daoudy , Sri Lankan Lawyer Hector W. ( " Harry " ) Jayawardene , and French Human Rights Activist Louis-Edmond Pettiti ( see box ) .
