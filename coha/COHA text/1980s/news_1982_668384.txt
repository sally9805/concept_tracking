For the last eight years - ever since Middlesex County ' s new 22- story court complex opened for business on Thorndike street - the old , abandoned courthouse building across the street has remained vacant , boarded-up and ignored . But last week the 70-year-old building suddenly became the focus of new attention . A Middlesex County grand jury began investigating the circumstances surrounding a Sept. 21 vote by two of three county commissioners to sell the courthouse . The proposed buyer was Samuel Perlman , a Somerville lawyer and real estate developer . That vote to sell the building was rescinded Sept. 28 , in the aftermath of a controversy that stirred Middlesex County politicians , as well as East Cambridge residents and members of the county ' s advisory board . But questions about the original action taken by Comrs . Michael E. McLaughlin and John Danehy to sell the building are still being raised . " The big question I have is why would they ( McLaughlin and Danehy* not try to open it ( the sale* up to as many people as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnew Jr. , the budget chairman of the Middlesex County Advisory Board , said in an interview . " I really can not understand why they wouldn ' t want to do that . " The commission chairman , Thomas Larkin , who later said he was " stunned " by the unexpected vote , opposed the sale . Perlman could not be reached for comment concerning the matter . In interviews , McLaughlin and a spokesman for Danehy denied any impropriety in their votes to sell the building to Perlman . According to courthouse sources , the grand jury investigation was called by Middlesex County Dist . Atty . John Droney to ascertain whether the state ' s conflict-of-law was violated when the two commissioners cast their votes . The two commissioners cast their votes to sell the courthouse last Sept. 21. during a regularly scheduled meeting . The sale of the courthouse was not on the agenda , however . And the $175,000 purchase price was half the amount that had been tentatively offered a week before on behalf of state officials who want to buy the building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also fell short of an appraisal commissioned by Danehy last June , as well as as estimate of the building ' s value that was listed in the county ' s 1980 annual report . The county ' s June 1980 annual report , compiled by the county treasurer , estimated the building ' s value at $1.5 million and the courthouse is insured for $2.1 million . The low selling price and the sequence of events leading up to the sale precipitated the district attorney ' s investigation , the sources said . Grand jury subpoenas have been issued for all three commissioners , as well as for their executive assistants , according to sources . In addition to the grand jury action , the office of Massachusetts Inspector General Joseph R. Barresi has sent an accountant to review Middlesex County financial records and is working to draft guidelines to govern future county real estate transactions . In an interview , McLaughlin said that his vote was motivated only by his desire to sell the courthouse after years of fruitless discussion about it . And attorney Thomas F. Gibson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell the building to Perlman , Danehy believed the county would be getting a fair deal . But Rep. Michael Barrett ( D-Reading ) , who led a group of legislators whowent to court to stop the sale , calls the vote by McLaughlin and Danehy " a fast shuffle . " " There ' s more here than meets the eye , " said Barrett . " When things happen this quickly , someone , somewhere is applying his shoulder to the mountain . " In a letter to the commissioners , Newton Mayor Theodore Mann , the chairman of the county ' s 54-member advisory board , also expressed his concerns over an action he said " gives the appearance . . . of something questionable . " The advisory board was empowered last July 1 to oversee county budget appropriations , but has no authority over decisions concerning county business . Mann has asked the commissioners to provide information about other county properties that have been sold or are now being leased . The possibility of selling the vacant courthouse has lingered on the business agenda for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state court officials over the years never reached the point of firm negotiations . In 1980 , however , the state appropriated $2.3 million specifically to buy the courthouse . Perlman , who owns the Otis Hospital in Cambridge and Central Hospital in Somerville , first expressed interest in buying the courthouse last February , in a letter written to the commissioners . He also met that month with members of the East Cambridge Planning Team , a neighborhood group that has long been concerned about the potential use of the now-vacant courthouse . Frank Budryk , president of the East Cambridge Planning Team , said residents never heard from Perlman after they asked him to submit a proposal to them in writing to address their concerns about parking and landscaping . In March , however , Perlman appeared twice before the county commissioners . His proposal to buy the abandoned courthouse for $175,000 and convert it into office condominiums was taken under consideration , but no vote was ever taken . Larkin said he never considered Perlman ' s offer a serious one , because of its low price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building that were submitted to the board in June . The first , conducted by the Cambridge firm of Laverty and Russo at the request of Danehy , placed the value of the building at $798,000 if it were used as a courthouse and $374,000 , if converted to offices . A second appraisal , done at the request of McLaughlin by Wingersky and Son of Boston , set the fair market value of the building at $175,000 - the exact price Perlman had offered earlier . Last week , Gerard Wingersky said that before his firm made the appraisal , his associate , Kenneth Sherman , met with Perlman to discuss the costs that the developer might encounter in his plans to convert the building to office condominiums . Meanwhile last August , Judge Arthur M. Mason , chief administrative justice of the Superior Court , appeared before the commissioners to express interest in the building . As a result , the board voted 2-1 to again begin discussing a possible sale to the state . On Sept. 13 . , Larkin ' s executive assistant met with Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the courthouse for $350,000 . Just a week later , however , the commissioners met for their regular Tuesday meeting , and McLaughlin and Danehy decided to vote to sell the building to Perlman . Now , with the original vote rescinded and a court order prohibiting the commissioners from selling the building by bids - a sale plan they voted Sept. 28 - the fate of the county ' s abandoned courthouse is still unclear . Larkin said he hopes no action is taken until after Jan. 5 , when Danehy ends his 17-year career as a county commissioner and his replacement takes office . As for McLaughlin , he now says he has no preference . " It doesn ' t matter what happens . I ' m already a loser on the issue , politically . "
