Describing the Southwest Conference , the Dallas Morning News headlined LEAGUE OF ILL REPUTE . It was no small scold in a year when athletic chicanery in other college athletic associations has prompted court cases involving charges of fraud , illegal firing and point shaving . But the Southwest Conference , where four of nine universities are on probation or are being investigated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association , has a special claim to dubious distinction : Southern Methodist University in Dallas , whose six N.C.A.A. probations in the past 28 years make it the reputed all-time leader among penalized schools . In mid-November , while under a three-year probation imposed in 1985 , S.M.U. was rocked by further allegations : football talent hunters had reportedly given $25,000 to one player and a rent-free apartment to another . <P> If proved , such violations could cost S.M.U. the first-ever " death &lt; penalty " of two years ' banishment from intercollegiate football  --  and $3.2 million in annual revenues the school normally earns from the sport . But winking at regulations is so endemic to big-time football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged donor of the free apartment ) George Owen , already permanently banned from recruiting by S.M.U. for previous violations , offered a classic rationale : " I do n't know why they 're making such a big deal of this , " he said . " Everyone bends the rules a little . " <P> Such attitudes are not altogether unknown in the 3,000-member Mustang Club , an S.M.U.-based organization whose dollars have helped underpin S.M.U. 's record as a jock palace ( three Bowl games and a No. 2 national ranking in the past six years ) . Says one faculty member : " Only being No. 1 counts for anything . . . getting there is all that counts as long as you do n't land in jail . " Advocates of this hard-line boosterism hoped that S.M.U. could skate past the death penalty and be back to business as usual in ' 88 after the probation ends . <P> But in a stunning move , the long-complaisant S.M.U. faculty , through its senate , called for an end to athletic subsidies . " Football has become out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Economics Professor J. Carter Murphy . " The college is running a big entertainment industry . " Two days later S.M.U. President L. Donald Shields took early retirement , citing a diabetes condition . <P> Nor was that all . Within a week Board Chairman  --  and Texas Governor-elect  --  Bill Clements announced the abolition of special admissions that let in some 15 athletes a year with SAT scores as low as 700 ( 400 points below the norm ) . And Clements declared he was " dead serious " about dropping the football program outright if it could not be brought under control . <P> Nine days later Athletic Director Bob Hitch and Football Coach Bobby Collins quit . Their resignations seemed normal in such circumstances , but there was irony in Shields ' departure . Since his arrival in 1980 , he had pushed academic improvement as well as big-time football , adding 21 endowed chairs . This year SAT scores of incoming students rose to 1,100 from last year 's respectable 1,020 . But Shields ' rejuvenated professoriat , says Faculty Senate President Leroy Howe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fundamental compromise of the institution . "
