 | With its revolutionary low-fare , nofrills service , People Express Airlines quickly won over an untapped market : the discretionary traveler . Backpacking vacationers flocked to its Newark terminal , patiently enduring long lines and even longer delays for a cut-rate price . In just five years this cadre of loyal " infrequent fliers " transformed People Express 's three 737s into an 80-jet fleet ? and the nation 's fifth largest airline . But that soaring growth has outdistanced the number of budget travelers , and the airline has plunged into the red . So it was no surprise last week when People announced it was @# changing its flight plan by ? how else ? ? going upscale . Starting this month People Express is heading into the pin-striped skies of first-class and business travel . The key to the marketing strategy is a new frequent-flier program called Travel Reward . By flying only 6,000 miles , compared with 10,000 or more at other airlines , passengers can receive a free upgrade to first class . People Express hopes to win over the business traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all flights and including food and drink in the fares . Other incentives will include assigned seating , for both coach and first class , and a special check-in to separate business and first-class passengers from the masses . The airline is also building a new headquarters at Newark and turning its old offices into passenger lounges , complete with a VIP suite . Even more important , it plans to join computer reservation services so that travel agents , who book most corporate trips , can sell tickets on People Express automatically . " Without these changes I would question the airline 's long-term viability , " says analyst Tim Pettee of L.F. Rothschild . People certainly needs some first-class profits . Figures released last week showed that the carrier lost a staggering $58 million in the first quarter ; that follows a loss of $27.5 million last year , when long-term debt reached $540 million , 10 times its debt load in 1981 . A large share of the airline 's losses stems from the ambitious expansion plans of People Express 's founder and president , Donald Burr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year it took over Britt and Provincetown-Boston airlines , giving it routes to 149 cities . Many analysts , however , say People Express has overreached itself . The airline 's low fares require an average 70 percent passenger load to break even , but lately it has been flying at only 60 percent capacity . Says analyst Louis Marckesano of Janney Montgomery Scott : " People Express has proven it can carry a lot of people . But so do the New York subways , and they do n't make any money , either . " Breaking even : People Express is confident it will restore profitability . No more major capital expenditures are planned , and refinancing put $130 million into its cash reserve . The new services are expected to increase passenger volume above the break-even point , particularly as the industry moves into the summer travel season . But the cost of the added services will eventually raise fares which , analysts say , have been too low . That means passengers with backpacks will pay more to subsidize passengers with briefcases . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American , wooing the same passengers with the same services . " It may work , " says analyst David Sylvester of Montgomery Securities . " But it will be a long-term effort to change people 's perceptions of the airline . " After all , how many first-class travelers will think of flying an airline called People Express ?
