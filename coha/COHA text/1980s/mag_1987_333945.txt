When Therese Martin died in 1897 , she was an unknown nun of 24 . She had lived 15 years at home with her father , nine more in the Carmelite cloister at Lisieux , France . She worked no eye-catching miracles , made no famous converts , succumbed to tuberculosis like many others of her time . Yet within 28 years of her death , Pope Pius XI had canonized Therese , and her artless autobiography , The Story of a Soul , had blossomed into one of the world 's best-selling books . <P> The secret of Therese 's overnight success was simple : she had a genius for loving Jesus . " Passing by me , " she wrote , " Jesus saw that I was ripe for love . He plighted His troth to me and I became His . " No self-denial attended this betrothal , only the deepest and most radiant devotion . Therese was a vibrant teenager , bursting with the juice of sanctity , and in Christ she found the ideal outlet for her holy passion . She reveled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemanly reticence . For Therese , God was the perfect man  --  an amalgam of loving husband , righteous father , adorable son , good-time pal , indefatigable lover  --  and she made herself the ultimate acolyte , surrendering to her heart 's crush . Throwing over reverence for schoolgirl rapture , Therese dared to love Jesus to pieces . <P> For God 's sunniest slave , a film of sensuous austerity . Alain Cavalier 's biography plays the incidents in Therese 's life as terse vignettes . The background is a spare , off-white wall . There are no raised voices or unnecessary gestures . Here stark 19th century mysticism meets skeptical 20th century minimalism . But , as Therese did with God , the film serves its subject , rather than imposing an ironic gloss . It communicates a girl 's consuming joy in finding , in Jesus , the object of her obsession . It also takes a peasant 's pleasure in the texture and even the temperature of every icon , from a bed warmer to a crucifix to the face of an old crippled nun preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she demands of young Therese . " A real kiss . The kind that warms you up . " The movie is a saint 's chaste kiss that warms you up . <P> Therese ( played with fierce clarity by Catherine Mouchet ) was one of four Martin sisters in the convent at Lisieux . The film portrays it as a true community , a beautiful sisterhood . For novices like Therese , every act of abasement is another wondrous rite of initiation into a high-spirited sorority of love and sacrifice . For the older nuns , the convent is not a prison but an enchanted castle that surrounds them with images of their beloved . All the sisters find beauty in duty , fulfillment in filth . One nun , ministering to lepers , consumes flakes of a diseased man 's skin as if it were the Eucharist . Later another nun tastes the dying Therese 's tubercular sputum and makes of it a sacrament of ecstatic commitment . To Cavalier , these acts have a spiritual and physical grace , for they are outward signs of the sisters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nothing is impossible , nothing is impure .
