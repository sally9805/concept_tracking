Lake Wobegon  --  a mythical small town , set in the Minnesota prairie heartlands , that millions of otherwise practical-minded Americans believe to be absolutely real . Saturday evenings , as dinner is cooking in the kitchens , these believers  --  listeners served by the 260-station American Public Radio network ( including Hawaii and Alaska ) ? huddle by their radios to hear the latest news from Lake Wobegon on " A Prairie Home Companion . " After the broadcast , they might devote the evening to reading Lake Wobegon Days ( Viking Penguin , 1985 ) , the No. 1-best-selling chronicle of the town 's history that was , along with its author , Garrison Keillor , the subject of a Time cover story . As in the case of Paul Bunyan , Minnesota 's previous mythical export ( Mary Tyler Moore aside ) , Lake Wobegon and its residents have taken on life by the sheer fact of their vivid place in our imaginations  --  quite an accomplishment for a community that , as Lake Wobegon Days tells it , had a less-than-auspicious beginning : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every spring the earth heaves up a new crop of rocks . Piles of rock ten feet high in the corners of fields , picked by generations of us , monuments to our industry . Our ancestors chose the place , tired from their long journey , sad for having left the motherland behind , and this place reminded them of there , so they settled here , forgetting that they had left there because the land was n't so good . So the new life turned out to be a lot like the old , except the winters are worse . " Lake Wobegon is , as that excerpt underscores , not a Shangri-la . Its populace , largely Norwegian Lutherans ( led by Pastor Ingqvist of Lake Wobegon Lutheran Church ) and German Catholics ( tended by Father Emil of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Church ) , are of hearty , seemingly serious stock . Life is a thrifty business for them . And yet they have a simplicity and warmth , not to mention an unpredictable wayward streak . How else could The Sidetrack Tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safe to be foolish " ) and The Fearmonger 's Shoppe ( " serving all your phobia needs since 1954 ? when it comes to safety , do n't expect to save money " ) both be doing such roaring business ? At times , Keillor 's Lake Wobegon resembles the Russian village of Chelrn  --  the setting of Fiddler on the Roof  --  where fools , peddlers , and rabbis continued the eternal debate over the nature of God while their wives complained , their children played , and their roofs leaked . Lake Wobegoners  --  similarly isolated , similarly filled with faith  --  surmount the difficulties ( often hilariously self-created ) of their lives through an awkward , endearing loyalty to the values of their ancestors : honesty , industry , church . In so doing , they have escaped from the world of " literature " or " entertainment " to become familiar figures  --  friends  --  presented on a live ( not a pretaped ) radio program . Keillor , the creator of the Lake Wobegon world , addressed the issue of the reality of Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often Asked About ' A Prairie Home Companion , ' and Eleven Answers Not Given Previously " : " No , there is no town in Minnesota named Lake Wobegon that I could show you ; at least I 'm not aware of one . But I would also have a hard time showing you the Ninth Federal Reserve District , the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis , the Big Ten , or the upper middle class . Most people deal very comfortably with abstractions much more far-fetched than Lake Wobegon  --  the Moral Majority , secular humanists , Hollywood , etc . " Compared to any of those , Lake Wobegon is as real as my hands on this typewriter and sometimes more real than that . I once dreamed that I drove over a hill in central Minnesota and found it Lake Wobegon . In the dream , they were n't particularly happy to see me , but they managed to be fairly polite . I was invited to someone 's house for supper , and then I woke up . " The dream of finding Lake Wobegon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the book , has become a nationwide obsession and haven . Keillor had longed to create a live radio show since doing a piece for the New Yorker on the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville . The first live " A Prairie Home Companion " broadcast  --  aired solely to a Minnesota audience  --  took place in a small college auditorium on July 6 , 1974 . There was an audience of 12 in the 400-seat hall , and the total gate ( $1 for adults , 50C for children ) was less than $8 . By 1980 , Families come together to listen : 11 they live in separate cities , they call each other after the shows to talk about the latest gossip overheard at the Chatterbox Caf ? , " where the coffeepot is always on , which is why it tastes that way . " In small Midwest towns you can see farmers in official Lake Wobegon " Whippets " baseball caps . Chic apartments in New York 's SoHo district are adorned by posters celebrating Keillor and Powdermilk Biscuits ? " biscuit mix in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown bag with the dark stains that indicate freshness . Heavens , they 're tasty and expeditious ! " Although " Home Companion " is not regularly broadcast outside the United States with the exception of a weekly airing in Australia ( there have been limited airings  --  to enthusiastic response  --  in Sweden ) , the show 's weekly fan-mail bag of 1,000 letters ( not including the extra hundred straightforward ticket requests ) confirms that its listenership is distinctly international . Cassettes of the show ? both those produced for sale by Minnesota Public Radio and those bootlegged by home-taping listeners ? pass hands throughout the world . Consider this recent letter from a Lutheran missionary in Madagascar ( who had not had " home leave " for three years ) : " Your program is immensely popular with ALC American Lutheran Church missionaries over here , and 1 think you should know that . Missing America does play a large part in our lives , and your blend of nostalgia and humor is very therapeutic . Relatives no longer wonder about what to get missionaries for Christmas ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows . . .11 used to be that when a person from our headquarters in Minneapoli , , would make a trip out here , he would be filled with requests to carry medicines . Now he carries ' PHC ' tapes ! ( Which , for us , are a kind of medicine . ) " A young American girl , homesick in December during her year abroad for studies in France , met a Frenchman who had spent time in the States and had brought back cassettes of the show upon his return . In her letter to Keillor she wrote : " I listened to your telling - of the Christmas Story , and I laughed a good bit and cried some , too . . . So thank you for my Christmas present : You gave it completely and unselfishly , to as many people as you could , not needing any thanks . And if that 's not what Christmas is all about , I do n't know what is . " Although those closely involved in the production of " Home Companion " are grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which qualities of the program make it so successful . Lynne Cruise , the director of the show , works with Keillor and the musical performers in setting the structure for each episode ; she also oversees all technical arrangements . After a number of years with " Home Companion , " surely she should know just what makes great radio . She laughs at the statement . " We 're still working on an answer to that . if we ever did get it right , we 'd probably quit . But radio is a remarkable medium . It communicates directly to listeners  --  you 're with them  --  as opposed to video , in which you are an onlooker staring at a screen . " The hardest part of the technical aspect of the broadcast is to achieve a quality that will make the persons at home full participants . When that happens , they do have a visual component to the show  --  they 're imagining as we go along , and everyone imagines differently , which makes it very personal . Videos provide the visual component , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the audio audiences play an important part in creating the mood and the feel of " Home Companion " broadcasts . " We have entirely separate audio mixes for the at-home and the in-house audiences , " she says . " The person at home is in a small room , an entirely different environment and feeling . We use a technique called ' panned mono ' to create a three-dimensional sound  --  at a seemingly genuine distance from a performance stage  --  with depth , like the live audience hears . " Ilene Zatal , a volunteer staff member who has been with the show for more than five years , has as her special assignment the handling of the voluminous listener mail . Zatal , who makes her living as a consultant to hospice programs , takes great pleasure in fashioning personal written responses to the hundreds of letters Keillor himself can not review . " At times it can be emotionally overwhelming that listeners , complete strangers before they write , can produce letters that share so much , with so much warmth and caring , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . They do n't write to tell us how they could do the show better . They 're giving a piece of themselves . That 's what opening the letters is like  --  discovering pieces of lives . " Every kind of person writes . I 'm surprised at the number of handwritten letters from men  --  they have n't been dictated to a corporate secretary . For many people , the show seems to remind them of a childhood they may not have had but would have liked to have had . Garrison is always emphasizing that the primary thrust of the show is not nostalgic  --  to take you back there  --  but it does , regardless . " People often write to say how a show reminds them of some important moral lesson they once learned ? by applying it and saving the day in a difficult situation . A number of people wrote to describe instances when they turned away from something because it did n't just affect themselves , but others as well . " The home base for " A Prairie T Home Companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . A one-time movie palace in the ' 30s , the World had fallen  --  before its occupancy by Keillor and crew  --  onto hard times as an inner-city derelict , abandoned by audiences preferring suburban cin- ema outlets . ( Keillor headlined a live broadcast marking the reopening of the World Theater on April 26 . ) Now the World Theater  --  from which the very real Lake Wobegon takes to the airwaves each week  --  has taken on new luster . One New York listener wrote after a trip to Saint Paul : " We 're so faithful that last spring , on a brief visit to our daughter in The Other Twin City , we drove by the front of the World Theater as if it were a famous cathedral ! "
