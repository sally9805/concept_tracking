The most fortunate ( and startled ) people in Chicago were those who packed the Roxy last Friday and Saturday nights to see and hear something called Accordion Summit 3 . Few of them knew what to expect beyond accordion music and certainly more than a few came for a hoot , a goof . What an image problem : The accordion is to musical instruments what Dick Butkus is to Shakespearean actors . But , to exaggerate not at all , Accordion Summit 3 was among the most exciting shows we have ever witnessed here , a musical revelation that soared and swung in the face of everyone ' s misconceptions about the maligned accordion . Yes , it was the hippest show in town . From the charming old-school craft of Caesar DiCato ' s tangos to the wild , foot-stomping sounds of the West River Boys ( who appear in the hit show " Pump Boys and Dinettes " at the Apollo Theater and perform as accordionists at local clubs such as Irish Eyes and Holsteins ) , the summit provided ample examples of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Gypsy Ensemble , Greg and Mary Zaborniak , David Dimaano , Mark Konewko and the B.Z. Squeezies provided two nights of stunningly different sounds : country and western , Cajun , Polish , Filipino , classical , experimental , Latin , Spanish and Gypsy . The first Accordion Summit was held in September , 1984 in New York . The second was four months after that . They were put together by Billy Swindler and Zeena Parkins , two musicians and friends who found themselves attracted to the accordion ' s possibilities and formed the B.Z. Squeezies . " Look at all the different types in here , " said Betty Murray , who owns this pleasant saloon/club at 1505 W. Fullerton Ave. with her husband , Pat . " Those guys , they look like Hell ' s Angels . They ' re here for the accordion . And those old ladies . The accordion ! " Of the Roxy summit , Swindler says , " I am tremendously pleased . No one really knew what to expect . But they realize something special is happening . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ' s what an accordion sounds like . ' Unfortunately , the association is always with Lawrence Welk and polka bands . A man who has been teaching and playing for 40 years came up to me after Friday ' s show and said , ' I had forgotten the accordion could be so much fun . ' " The next summit is scheduled this spring in Manhattan . Swindler ( performing in " Pump Boys " since April ) would like to hold Accordion Summit 5 in May in Chicago . It would be different , he says . He wants three performances in three very different locales : a Randolph Street art gallery , a club like the Roxy and a place like Cabaret Metro . " The accordion has had a bad rap , " he says . " But most people were never aware , have never been exposed to the full range of the instrument . For me , the purpose of the summit , without being pedantic , without putting it on a pedestal , is to educate and entertain . " Done. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleek little saloon ( calling itself a " drinkery " ) tucked into the Sheraton-Naperville Hotel , East-West Tollway and Naperville Road in Naperville ( 369-1900 ) . It was jammed . Some of the patrons were obviously paying guests of the hotel but a surprising number proved to be natives of the area . " This is an entertainment wasteland , " said one fellow . " It ' s growing but there isn ' t a lot to do out here . I like this place and I like the DJ . She ' s cute . " The DJ ' s name in Chris Harvey . Still on the pleasant side of 25 , she has been working at LaSalle for more than six months . Before that , she worked at a number of Cattle Company locations . She lives with her parents in Marquette Park . ( " At first I thought ' DJ ? ' " said mother Anna . " But I ' ve seen her do her job . She ' s so good . We ' re so proud . " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes her job seriously . " I ' m like the hostess at a big party , " she said . " And it ' s my job to keep all the guests happy . In a way I ' m a performer , the center of the room , and it ' s my job to keep that room happy . " Between spinning records , Harvey handles the wide variety of promotional gimmicks the club employs . These include lip-synching contests , trivia contests , ' 50s nights , horoscope nights , biggest sales-slip nights and the traditonal ladies ' nights . She also must deal with the astonishing number of people who want to talk to her during the course of any night . Most are merely requesting songs or harmlessly shooting the breeze . Others are interested in things of a more personal nature . " Oh , sure , a lot of guys ask me out , " she says . " You have to be very personable and outgoing . And sometimes , well , guys get the wrong idea . That ' s one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Zeena Parkins and Billy Swindler : Bringing new dignity to the accordion .
