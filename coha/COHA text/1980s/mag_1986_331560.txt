Bethesda Naval is the hospital of Presidents . Ronald Reagan went there last year to have a cancerous polyp removed from his colon . Richard Nixon was treated for viral pneumonia at the 500-bed facility in 1973 . Lyndon Johnson had his gall bladder excised at the hospital in 1965 then proudly displayed his scar to anyone who cared to see it . Bethesda , in the northwest outskirts of Washington , D.C. , is also a jewel in the crown of the U.S. military health care system , whose 688 facilities care for the nation 's wounded in time of war . But presidential patronage notwithstanding , the massive system , and Bethesda in particular , has been sorely wounded in recent weeks and may be slow to recover from the strange case of Commander Donal M. Billig , whose court-martial was still under way last week at the Washington Navy Yard . <P> Billig , 55 , was chief of Bethesda 's cardiothoracic surgery in 1983 and ' 84 . He is charged with five counts of involuntary manslaughter resulting from technical foul-ups and poor judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges specifies that Billig " wrongfully sewed " and tied blood vessels during bypass surgery , " improperly manipulated " heart tissue and , in one case , " tore " a woman 's aorta and " improperly repaired " it . Also listed are 24 counts of dereliction of duty for performing unauthorized operations . If he is convicted on all counts , the surgeon , who was commissioned in December 1982 , faces dismissal from the Navy and a maximum of 21 years in prison . Meanwhile , 15 of Billig 's former patients or dependents of former patients have sued the Federal Government for $75.7 million in malpractice claims . <P> The beleaguered surgeon suffers from an appalling handicap : 20/400 vision in his right eye , the result of a 1978 tennis accident . Because of the damage , which is only partially correctable , the prosecution contends that Billig can not accurately judge depth and distances . A number of his former colleagues have stated under oath that he is unable to see small blood vessels in tissues and has difficulty clamping arteries and veins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the operating room , described his technique as that of " a first-year resident . " <P> Billig 's substandard performance at Bethesda should have come as no surprise . Before joining the staff there , he had been fired from two previous jobs , one at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch , N.J. , in 1980 , and another with a Pittsburgh physicians ' group in 1982 . When he arrived at Bethesda the following year , he had not performed open-heart surgery in six years . Nonetheless , the Navy permitted him to undertake such operations after only six months of retraining . Last month Monmouth 's chairman of surgery , Dr. Cyril Arvanitis , revealed that he had begun to suspect Billig after examining weekly reports of patient deaths . " Dr. Billig 's cases began to appear with increasing frequency , " Arvanitis testified . " We kept seeing new cases , and his explanations were n't satisfactory . "
