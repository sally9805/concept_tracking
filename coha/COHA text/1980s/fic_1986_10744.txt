It still be two lists , one say , " White Man Can , " other say , " Nigga Ca n't , " and white man still be the onliest one can write on em . ' So he do n't run no more . Run for what ? ' he say . Get caught just be that much worseroff . Maybe is a place without no whites , nigga can be free . ' But he do n't know where that is . He find it , he say we have us babies then .

" No matter though , " she said with her eyes closed . " Masa kill Kaine before it get time for us to go . " They were both quiet for some time .

If that be true , " she said as he opened his mouth to speak , " why I not be happy when I live it . " June 29 , 1847As today is Sunday I held no formal sessions with Odessa . But , in order to further cultivate the rapport thus far achieved , I read and interpreted for her selected Bible verses . We were in our habitual place under the elm tree and I must admit that the laziness of the hot Sunday afternoon threatened , at times , to overcome me ( as Hughes had warned it would . As a consequence he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt my vigilance would be impaired by the heat . I replied that , in as much as the darky would remain chained as usual , there was no danger involved in such a venture  --  unless , of course , there was some question about the actions of his ownp51darkies . He was stung by the retort as I meant him to be , but he did surrender the keys . It has really become quite tedious to plow the same ground with Hughes each time I want to do something with Odessa that he considers out of the ordinary . I shall make it my business to obtain another key to the cellar and to the chain with which she is bound to the tree  --  at my suggestion , this is the only one that in her quietedstate she now wears . It is not to my liking to be required to request permission each time I wish to talk with the gal ) . My drowsiness was compounded , I finally realized , by the monotonous melody she hummed . I have grown , it appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural part of the setting , like the clucking of the hens or the lowingof the cattle . Thinking to trap her into an admission of inattention , I asked her to repeat the lessons I had just imparted . She did so and I was pleased to find her so responsive . However , the humming became so annoying that I was forced to ask her to cease . She looked up at me briefly and though I had not threatened her , I believe she was mindful of previous punishments and of the fact that it is only through my influence that she is able to escape from her dark hole for these brief periods . She assured me it was n't " no goodtimingsong " ; it was about " the righteousness and heaven . " I asked her to sing it and I set it down here as I remember and understand it : Gon na march away in the gold bandIn the army by ' n by , Gon na march away in the gold bandIn the army by ' n by . Sinner , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going do that day ? When the fire arolling behind you In the army by ' n by ?  |p52It  is , of course , only a quaint piece of doggerel which the darkies cunningly adapt from the scraps of Scripture they are taught . Nevertheless , the tune was quite charming when sung ; the words seemed to put new life into an otherwise annoying melody and I was quite pleased that she had shared it with me . We were both quiet for several moments after she had done . The heat was , by this time , an enervating influence upon me . She , too , seemed to be spent by that brief animation . After a few moments , I closed the Bible , prayed briefly for the deliveranceof her soul , and would have returned her to the cellar . But , she spoke . " They caught ev  --  " she said suddenly , turning to me . Instantly I recognized in those few syllables the beginning of the question she had started to ask me the other day . " Some nigras did get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are ! " This was a bit impetuous of me , but to have confirmed what I have suspected all along made me incautious . The blank sullen look immediately returned to her face , but I count that as nothing . She will be brought to give up this information ! * *Later : Hughes says there is talk of a " maroon " settlement , an encampmentof runaway slaves , somewhere in the vicinity . There have been signs of marauding about some of the farms and plantations farther out from town . In the latest incident , severalblacks ( the wife of the farmer could not give an accurate count ) stole into a small farm about fifteen miles southeast of here , took provisions and the farm animals , and seriously wounded the farmer when he tried to protect his property . Fortunately , the wife was hidden during the raid and thus escaped injury . Hughes was inclined to treat this as an isolatedincident  --  claiming that the other cases had happened so long ago that they had become greatly exaggerated in the telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figment in the imagination of the larger slave holders . He put down the missing provisions and the occasional loss of livestock to the thieving of the planters ' own darkies . I am aware , as I told him , that an unsupervised darky will steal anything which is not nailed down , yet , in light of Odessa 's talk of a place without whites and her concern about " catching "  --  talkwhich I repeated  --  I can not dismiss the theory of an encampment of some sort so easily . It is , of course , pure conjecture , but not , I believe , groundless to say , as I did to Hughes , that perhaps the unaccounted-for darkies had joined the maroons  --  which would certainly be one place without whites . And it 's obvious the darkies from the coffle were making for somewhere when they were apprehended . Hughes was much impressed with my reasoning and invited me to join the posse which leaves at dawn tomorrow in search of the renegades . I readily accepted , for , even knowing the imaginativeflights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put much faith in this information precisely because it was given inadvertently . What information Hughes and the prosecutor were able to obtain from the others  --  and from the darky herself regarding the uprising  --  is as nothing compared to this plum. * *Dessa had come to look forward to the talks with the white man ; they made a break in the monotony of her days . She had slept a great deal when she first came to the farm , surrendering in the deep quiet of the cellar to the exhaustion she had held so long at bay . But , once she was rested , misery had come upon her in shudderingwaves she hoped would kill her ; and the dreams . She had paced restlessly , the chain that held her to the stake in the middle of the dirt floor clanking behind her . Sometimes she lay listlessly on the pallet or sat against the wall behind the dull sunlight that entered through the tiny window . Always , whether her eyes were open or closed , Kaine walked with her , or mammy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down about some lit/tle foolishness . Aunt Lefonia , Martha  --  They sat with her in the cellar . She grieved in this presence as she had not done since their loss . Often she saw Leo , his bald head shining in the moonlight , his face a bloody mess , and felt his body heavy and supine where it had rolled against her knee . Her hands moved ineffectually above the gapping hole in his chest . Big Nathan whispered eerily , urgently , above her , " Help me get his jacket off . Help me ! " Leo 's skin was still warm , the flesh flaccid  --  She cringed away from that memory , that ghostly vision . They had n't killed Leo ; one of the white men had done that . And Leo  --  The white men would think Leo was Nathan , if they could n't see his face . Nathan had been ferocious in battle but he could not look into Leo 's dead face . He had raised the rock above his head and closed his eyes as it descended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , so much for it all to end in this hole . Talking with the white man kept her , for those brief periods , from counting and recounting the cost . Jemina said he was making some writing , a book , about the fight on the coffle . The big , light-skinned woman came to see her almost every night , often bringing some special fixings from the white folks ' supper table that she passed to Dessa through the bars of the cellar window . At first , in her misery , Dessa had n't understoodwhy the house servant would take such risks for her , or even wondered why . She had merely accepted dumbly whatever the woman offered . Jemina 's kindness had eventually penetrated her despair and , finally , Dessa had asked why . " Why ? " Jemina chuckled softly . " Why , honey , you 's the debil woman . ' " Hurriedly , she told how the people in the neighborhoodhad coined the name from the slave trader Wilson 's description of the uprising . It expressed their derision of slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight that a " devil " had been the agency of one 's undoing . Dessa had not liked the idea of such notoriety , but she was pleased to know that others knew of that daring , that brief moment of exultation in the clearing , when all had stood free , by their own doing , of beads and chains . She was grateful for the brief companionship of the other womanp55for no one else came near her . Now and then she did hear a scrap of song or caught a word from a raised voice that might have been meant for her to hear . Often when she sat with the white man she saw one of the men or women going about some errand in the yard . Once , two wide-eyed , bare-bellied children had appeared suddenly behind the white man 's shoulder . One had smiled quickly , tentatively , at her , then they had scampered away as silently as they had come . The white man never knew they were there . Twice a day , Jemina brought her meals . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray without a word . More and more often now , Beaumont , Jemina 's husband , unlocked the door . " Masa say he got better things to do than wait on some darky , " Jemina had chuckled the first time Beaumont guarded the door . " Go on , look . " She gestured toward the stairway . Dessa , her chain clanking , walked to the bottom step and looked up through the doorway . Beaumont , his foreshortened figure framed by the light , his face shadowed by a hat , cradled a rifle in his arms . He wiggled the fingers of one hand at her ; his teeth flashed whitely and were gone . Jemina took up Dessa 's slop jar and turned with a nod and brief smile and she , too , was gone . Dessa understood ; even with Beaumont above , it would not do to tarry . At night , Jemina hunkered down beside the window for a few moments ' whispered conversation , meaningless words of encouragementthat Dessa appreciated nonetheless . Sometimes Jemina brought news that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was how Dessa knew the white man had studiedwhat the court said about the fight . She had no idea what a " court " was ; she had never been more than five miles from where she was born before being sold , nor seen more than three or four white people together , except at a distance . She had no words to describe much of what she had experienced , or what those experiences had forced her to see . She understood " court " as white folks for trying to figure out if everyone on the coffle had been caught . She wanted to know this herself , so she watched and listened . The white man was little , hardly taller than herself , she thought ,  |p56but  he kept a careful distance between them , even outside under the tree , sitting above and behind her , his chair tilted back on its hind legs , its back against the tree . He would lean forward long enough to wave her to a spot several feet from him , using the **26;14577;TOOLONG she knew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer smelled  --  Jemina now brought her water to wash in  --  and it shamed and angered her that he still thought she did . Always above her , behind her if she turned her head , she heard tapping , in the silence between his questions , his finger flicking proudly against the gold chain he wore at his waistcoat . She could n't always follow the white man 's questions ; often he seemed to put a lot of unnecessary words between his " why " and what he wanted to know . And just as she had puzzled out what that was , he would go on to the next question . " Who had the file ? " he would ask , and how could she answer that ? There had been no file . Nathan had knocked out the trader where he slept and taken the keys to the chains from the saddlebags the trader used as a pillow . So , having no answers , she gave none , though she had listened carefully at first : Maybe this white man would tell her something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her that the white man did not expect her to answer . She had kept a carefulexpression on her face , now and then cutting her eyes at him to see if he required some response ; but , despite her best efforts , her attention wandered . Once she had looked up and seen his face contorted with the violence of some unexpressed feeling . She had shrunk from him , her chains clanking about her , and he had hit her in the face . She had not taken the full force of the blow ; she had been warned by that one startling glance . Her nose had bled some and she now kept her face vacant ( better to appear stupid than sassy ) ; but her mind continued to roam . Had Master looked at Kaine like this white man looked at her ? Why ? White folks did n't need a why ; they was : his voice , quiet and mocking , pulsing like a light through the darkness inside her . " Kaine  --  " She did n't know she had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knew it in the next instanceas her own . How hoarse and raspy it sounded . She had notp57spoken above a whisper , except in muttered response to some white man 's questions , in weeks . Caught in her own flow , she listened and continued , seeing as she spoke the power of Master as absoluteand evil . Terrell Vaugham , by virtue of his marriage to Mary Lenore Reeves , owned three farms , the large Home Farm and two smaller outlying properties , and a house in Charleston . Dessa did n't know how many people he owned . Somebody was always being born . Two or three times , a relative or family friend had died and left someone to one of the Reeveses , as Martha had been inherited by Young Mistress when an elderly cousin died . Master Vaugham had brought no slaves to the marriage ( not even a manservant , Childer , scandalized , had reported ) , as Old Mistress had brought mammy , the dairy maid , and Lefonia , the personal one . All the children were separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the care of Mamma Hattie and a couple of older or younger women  --  depending on who was just up from childbed or otherwiseailing . When the children were old enough to work , usually around six or seven , they were parceled out among the farms and the town house to fetch and carry , as Dessa had been put with her mother in the dairy . Often they were hired out to local farms or businesses or apprenticed to a craftsman on the Home Farm  --  as mammy had feared that Dessa would be apprenticed in the dairy . Carrie Mae , Dessa 's older sister , already worked there ; the only reason they would need three women in the dairy was that one was going to be sold . But Dessa , like many others , found a permanentplace on one of the farms . If they lived , they lived long . But the toll of those who did not , who died or were permanently debilitated by the annual fevers , by one or another of the ailments that walked through the Quarterswith agonizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaping need for more and more hands to plant , to reap , to make , to clean , to feed . Or , you were sold away . Increasingly , they were sold away . Even in dreams that threat had haunted her . Master Vaugham had improved their working conditions . Theyp58were never in the fields before sunup and seldom there much after sundown . They were given an hour-and-a-half break at noon , nursing mothers two . Roofs were repaired , weevily meal replaced . But they all knew , without , it seemed to her , ever having discussedit among themselves , that as soon as they learned some craft or task , they were liable to be sold . They were bred for market , like the cows mammy milked , the chickens that she fed . Dessa had not admitted this to herself , even under Kaine 's prodding . She saw the past as she talked , not as she had lived it but as she had come to understand it . White men existed because they did ; Master had smashed the banjo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what he felt like doing . And a nigger could , too . This was what Kaine 's act said to her . He had done ; he was . She had done also , had as good as killed Master , for was n't her own punishment worse than death ? She had lost Kaine , become a self she scarcely knew , lost to family , to friends . So she talked . She was reconciled to nothing , but the dreams or haunts that had crowded about her in the cellar now walked the sunlit air and allowed her peace at night . Memory stopped the day Emmalina met her as she had come out of the fields . Dessa came back to that moment again and again , recognizing it as dead , knowing there was no way to change it , arriving at it from various directions , refusing to move beyond it . Out there was nightmare , Kaine 's body , cold and clammy beneath her hands , Master laughing in her face , the horror that scarred her inner thighs , snaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed with patent-leather smoothness . Once the white man 's questioning had driven her into that desert and Young Mistress had risen from the waste , clothes torn , hair screaming , red-faced , red-mouthed . The four red welts in the suddenlypallid face , the white spot where her thumb had pressed at the base of the red neck filled Dessa with a terror and glee so intensethey were almost physical . Frightened at her own response , she was almost ashamed  --  not of the deed . No . Never that , but surely it was wrong to delight so deeply in anyone else 's pain . She had seen the blood and bits of pink flesh beneath her own fingernails , felt again the loose skin of Young Mistress 's neck . Andp59clamped her mouth shut , clanked her arms across her chest . She should have killed the white woman ; they would have killed her then . It would all have been over ; none of this would have begun . She did n't know where " this " had begun . There was no set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Nate was paying attention to her or that the young mulatto boy who often walked the chain in front of her was being kind . Graduallyshe had realized that she never stumbled when the mulatto walked in front of her , that there was always something extra on her plate  --  a bit of home-fry when everyone else had only grits , alittle molasses for her bread . She expected that one or both of them would come fumbling at her in the dark . The men and women were bound together at night ; and , while it was more common for the white guards to take one of the women , the chains were no real barrier to a determined couple . They were encouraged to it . Pregnancy was proof of a woman 's breeding capacity ; and the boy was often chained with her at night . But neither man touched her . Cully , the mulatto , talked to her about the stars when they happened to lie next to each other at night . She knew the drinking gourd , the North Star in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rabbit , put there , so he said , because of a low trick Rabbit had played on Brother Bear . Often he touched her stomachand marveled that the baby moved . This was all that she rememberedof those nights . For at first she had paid him no attention . He talked just like a white man ; except for his nappy yellow hair , he looked just like a white man . Later , he reminded her of Jeeter , her only living brother , who had been sold away . The big , bald-head driver , Nathan , had been with the trader the day she was bought . It shamed her somehow to know he had seen her so low and she was glad they could none of them hold a real conversation . The coffle walked twenty miles a day , and even around the campfire , talk among them was discouraged . But Dessa knew herself to be enveloped in caring . The pain and tiredness of her body numbed her mind ; she was content to leave it that way . Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their freedom , about their trials under slavery , Dessa was silent . Their telling awoke no echoes in her mind . That part of the past lay sealed in the scars between her thighs . Dessa could n't understand why this white man would want to take her out under the tree and talk about Kaine , and behind her inquiring expression she resented his careless references . Was n't no darky to it , she would think indignantly . Kaine was the color of the cane syrup taffy they pulled and stretched to a glistening golden brown in winter . Or , Childer had said the words over them , looking at each of them in turn , disapproving , Dessa knew , of Kaine 's choice ( but he had chosen , Lawd ! he had chosen her , brown as she was , with no behind to speak of , and he had wanted her  --  not for no broom-jumping mess , but the marriage-words and Childer just had to accept that ) . Talking with the white man was a game ; it marked time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lightly capping , as though he were no more than some darky bent on bandying words with a likely-looking gal . Maybe she had been careless with the white man , she worried now . She had lain awake in the early morning hours watching the window as it slowly grayed with dawn light . The baby kicked vigorouslyin her side ; she put her hand to her stomach , feeling it ripple with the baby 's movement , and crooned wordlessly to it . She had slipped in asking anything of the white man that did not turn his own questions back upon themselves ; maybe she had caught herself in time . He had n't pressed her and she could n't bring herself to regret that betraying impulse . To know that someone , Nathan , anyone had gotten away . . . She had forced Nathan and Cully to abandon her , clambering noisely back toward the sound of sporadic pistol fire , where she knew she would find the patterrollers . Her flight had been an act of total despair . Someone had to escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . She was barefoot , pregnant  --  She had already held Nathan and Cully back insisting that any who wanted to be free must be given a chance . Nathan had grudgingly agreed . In the melee of a general escape , the three of them would be harder to track . He had planned at first to free only Dessa and Cully on some moonless night whenp61the two were chained together . He had a key , as did all the guards , to the shorter chains by which groups of five or six were chained together at night . Only Wilson had a key to the manacles and Cully argued against taking it . Best to let sleeping dogs lie ; the three of them could be away while the camp slept and once free could worry about the manacles . But with more than half the coffle expected to run , they had to have the slave trader 's keys . Their numbers grew , David , Matilda , Elijah , Leo , two or three others Nathan felt could be trusted . They talked only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , of stranding them . The actual deed there in the clearing was more frightening and more exhilarating than any of them had imagined . Nothing went as planned . They had wanted a dark night , but there had been moonlight ; Cully and Dessa were n't chained in the same group . The white men had delivered a big lot of people to an outlying plantation and were in a relaxed mood . They had sat long and drunk deep by the campfire , two of them falling asleep there ; the rest managed to make their way to their bedrolls . Not long after the camp settled into sleep , one of the white men sought out Linda , a mulatto girl purchased in Montgomery , and led her into the bushes . The other white men did n't even rouse up as the guard thrashed off into the underbrush with Linda , but everyone on the coffle was awake . Every night since Montgomery , one of the white men had taken Linda into the bushes and they had been made wretched by her pleas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then came the rattle of chains and above it a dull thud , startingly loud in the stillness , and the rattling of the chains again . In his lust and alcoholic daze , the guard had failed to secure the chain after he removed Linda from it . Someone in Linda 's chain group moved and all their chains fell away . Seeing this as a sign , Elijah whispered urgently for Nathan , who was alreadymoving stealthily toward Dessa 's group . Linda appeared in the clearing , her dress torn and gaping , the bloody rock still clutched in her manacled hands . All hell broke loose . The white men asked her later about attacking the trader , butp62whatever answer she had given ( and she thought she had given several different ones ) , she could not remember the trader as distinctfrom the other white men . She 'd tried to kill as many of them as she could . The one thing that stuck in her memory from that night was Nathan in the moonlight , crushing the face of his friend . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go north , following the drinking gourd to freedom . There was a mighty river to cross , David admitted , but once across it , they would all be free . Most wanted to go with Nathan , who planned to take Dessa and Cully south to the coast . They could find a ship there to take them to islands he had heard of where slavery had been abolished and black men were all free . Again , Nathan consented , not so grudgingly that time , she thought now , for he had fallen in with their plans . Matilda wrote a pass for them , stating that all of them were in the charge of Toby , a big mulatto , and Graves , a lean brown man approaching middle age , taking them to their master on a plantation farther south . The moon had set by the time this was decided . They took wagons , weapons , and horses . The wagons proved too cumbersome for the quick cross-country trip Nathan said was imperative . They plundered , then abandoned them , piling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day , by night and sleeping by day . The patterrollers came up on them one morning just as they were retiring , having , as they thought , eluded the white man for yet another day . Nathan and Cully , never far from her , took her hands and ran . Afterward , when she burst into the clearing where the captured people were held , she had fought fiercely hoping by the strength of her resistance to provoke them into killing her . They had n't ; a blow to her head quickly ended her struggles . She kept count , on the trail and in the warehouse where they were held , scanning the faces of those who were recaptured , culling through the whisperednames and descriptions of those who had been killed . Nathan  --  Nate , as the white men called him  --  was reported dead and no one of Leo 's description was ever mentioned in her hearing.  |p63Only  Toby of the several mulattoes on the coffle had been taken alive and she mourned Cully , giving him up as lost . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from the warehouse where Dessa and the rest were held . Those who remained learned their fates when some were taken out and did n't return , or returned whipscarred and branded . Yet , as the population in the warehouse dwindled , a pinprick of hope was born in Dessa . Perhaps their ruse had worked and Nathan had survived . Had it not been for that hope , her own sentence would have driven her mad . To be spared until she birthed the baby . . . the baby . . . Could she but do it again , she sometimes thought , she would go to Aunt Lefonia if that would bring her even a minute , real and true , with Kaine . But to let their baby go now , now .. . She would swallow her tongue ; that 's what Mamma Hattie said the first women had done , strangling on their own flesh rather than be wrenched from their homes . . . . She would ask Jemina for a knife .... She would take the cord and loop it around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowed ; the conch sounded . Dimly , so softly at first it might have been the echo of her own crooning , she could hear the people assembling for work , a mumbled word here , the chink of a hoe , the clunk of one implement hitting against another . A warbled call soared briefly above the dawn noise ; sometimes this signaled the beginning of a song , one voice calling , another answeringit , some other voice restating the original idea , others takingup one or another line as refrain . She never heard more than fragments of these songs ; whatever commentary they contained did not carry beyond the Quarters , but she recognized many of the tunes . Now and then she mouthed the words or soundlessly improviseda response of her own . She came to recognize some of the voices , a nasal soprano she learned was Jemina 's , a full-throated voice that skipped from baritone to soprano in a single slurring note , the clear tenor that ascended to falsetto and yodeled across the dawn much as Kaine 's had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenor rose briefly and was silent . Kainep64could have made another banjo ; he had made the first one . Why , when they had life , had made life with their bodies  --  ? The questiongnawed at her like lye . She shut her mind to it ; it would eat away her brain , did she let it , leave her with nothing but a head full of maggots . On impulse , she moved to the window , her chain rattling behind her , and standing on tiptoe looked out . She could see nothingexcept the dusty yard that sloped away from the cellar , but she sang anyway , her raspy contralto gathering strength as her call unfolded : Tell me , sister ; tell me , brother , How long will it be ? She had never sung a call of her own aloud and she repeated it , wondering if any of them would hear her : Tell me , brother ; tell me , sister , How long will it beThat a poor sinner got to suffer , suffer here ? There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark falsetto : Tell me , sister ; tell me , brother , When my soul be free ? Other voices joined in , some taking up the refrain , " How long will it be ? , " others continuing the call ; her voice blended with theirs in momentary communion : Tell me , oh , please tell me , When I be free ? They had begun the chorus a second time when another voice , a rough baritone that Dessa did not recognize , joined in , singing at a faster tempo against the original pace.  |p65Oh  , it wo n't be long . Say it wo n't be long , sister , Poor sinner got to suffer , suffer here . The words vibrated along her nerves ; was this really an answer ? She sang again : Tell me , brother , tell me , How long will it be ? Again the voice soared above the chorused refrain : Soul 's going to heaven , Soul 's going ride that heavenly train Cause the Lawd have called you home . Startled , Dessa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voice cut across the singing and she was still a moment , heart thudding . " Who that ? " she called . No one called her Odessa but the white folk ; only Jemina came to the window . " Odessa . " It came again and she bundled the chain in her arms and moved soundlessly back to the window . " Who that ? " She saw the pale blur of a face at the window even as she recognized the voice of the white man . " I 'm leaving in a few minutes . " " You do n't be coming back ? " Jemina had not told her about this . She moved closer to the window , letting her chain drop noisily to the ground . " Oh , I shall indeed return in a few days and we will resume our conversations then . " He paused a moment as though waiting for some response from her ; when she made none , he continued . " We are going in search of a maroon settlement . " " Maroon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put special emphasis on it.  | " An encampment of runaway slaves that 's rumored to be somewhere in this vicinity . " She clutched the bars of the window and peered at him through them . She had not understood the half of what he said , catching only the meaning of " camp " and " runaway . " He stooped awkwardlyat the window , his face almost touching his knees . It was a ridiculous posture and she turned her face to hide her grin . " You a real white man ? " she asked , turning back , as the thought struck her . " For true ? You do n't talk like one . Sometime , I do n't even be knowing what you be saying . You do n't talk like Masa and he a real uppity-up white man , but not like no po buckra , neither . Kaine say it be 's white men what do n't talk white man talk . You one like that , huh ? " She could hear him suck in his breath before he answered sharply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " " Oh , you a teacher man , " she exclaimed childishly . He was angryand she continued hurriedly , " Was a teacher man on the coffle . " She was grinning in his face now , feeling him hang on her every word .

That be what he call it , the Good Word ; and when his masa find out what he be doing , he be sold south same 's if he teaching a bad word or be a bad nigga or a prime field hand . " " Is he the one who obtained the file ? " the white man asked quickly . Dessa laughed tiredly , wanting now only to hurry the white man on his way . " Onliest freedom he be knowing is what he call the righteous freedom . That what the Lawd be giving him or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one the patterrollers killed . " She moved back into the darkness of the cellar , still laughing softly . " Odessa ! " he called again . " Whatcho want ? " she asked moving toward him . " Whatcho want ? " stopping just outside the pool of gray light . There was a shout from the yard and the white man 's face dis/appeared from the window . She could see his legs clearly now as his hands brushed at the legs of his trousers . " You will learn what I require when I return , " he flung at her . The sound of his departing footsteps was lost in the new song the people had begun during their conversation . Dessa joined in , suddenly jubilant , her voice floating out across the yard . Good news , Lawd , Lawd , good news . My sister got a seat and I so glad ; I heard from heaven today . Good news , Lawdy , Lawd , Lawd , good news . I do n't mind what Satan sayCause I heard , yes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . On the TrailSouth and West of Linden June 30 , 1847We set out early this morning , picking up the trail of the renegades at the farm where they were last seen . It led us in a southerly direction for most of the day and then , just before we stopped for the night , it turned to the west . The trackers expect to raise some fresher sign of them tomorrow for , by their tracks , they appear laden with supplies and we are not ( a fact to which my stomach can well attest . Dried beef and half-cooked , half-warmed beans are not my idea of appetizing fare ) . And , I am told , if the weather holds humid as it has been and does not rain , their scent will hold fresh for quite a while and the dogs will be able to follow whereverit leads . I did see Odessa this morning before we departed . I heard singing and , at first , taking this to be the usual morning serenadeof Hughes ' darkies , I took no notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintive note of this song ( a peculiar circumstance , for Hughes , despite his disclaimerp68to the contrary , does frown on the darkies ' singing any but the liveliest airs ) . I listened and finally managed to catch the words  --  something about the suffering of a poor sinner . I had no sooner figured them out  --  and recognized Odessa 's voice  --  when another voice , this one lower and harsher , took up the melody , singing at a somewhat faster tempo while Odessa maintained her original pace . It gave the effect of close harmonicpart singing and was rather interesting and pleasing to the ear , especially when other voices joined in , as they presently did . This is the liveliest tune I have heard Odessa sing and I went round to the cellar window . There proved to be no time , however , for the kind of session such as now has become our custom  --  quite vexing . Odessa was a bit fractious , probably no more than a sign of her returning spirits . And no more than a careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came under the influence of that fool buck so young . Even now , with prudent schooling  --  That Vaugham was a fool ; of course one puts aside such things when one marries  --  as Mims did when he wed Miss Janet . Had I but had Odessa 's breaking , that intemperate nature should have been curbed . What a waste that she should have fallen into such hands as those . * *Somewhere South and West of Linden July 3 , 1847A wild goose chase and a sorry time we have had of it . I much doubt that there is an encampment , such as I first conceivedof , at least in this vicinity . We have searched a large area and come up with nothing conclusive . Several times , we sighted what might have been members of such a band , but the dogs could not tree them and it was more than we ourselvescould do to catch more than what we hoped were fleeting glimpses of black bodies . Whether they took , indeed , to the trees , or vanished into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have no way of knowing . If they exist , they are as elusive as Indians , nay , as elusive as smoke , and I feel it beyond the ability of so large a group as this posse to move warily enough to take them unawares . To compound matters , the storm that has been threatening for days finally broke this morning , putting an end to our search and drenching us in the process . We have stopped to rest the horses , for Hughes estimates that if we push hard , we should reach Linden by nightfall . A bed will be most welcome and , perhaps , I shall see also about something to warm it when we get back . Hughes has given the call to mount and so we are off. **July 4 , 1847 Early MorningI put the date in wearied surprise . We have been out most of the night scouring the countryside for signs of Odessa , but there were none that we found and the rain has by now washed away what we must have missed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her were not humanblood , human flesh , but sorcerers who whisked her away by magic to the accursed den they inhabit . Hughes maintainedthat the devil merely claimed his own , and gave up the search around midnight . But reason tells me that the niggerswere not supernatural , not spirits or " haints . " They are flesh and bone and so must leave some trace of their coming and going . The smallest clue would have sufficed me for I should have followed it to its ultimate end . Now the rain has come up and even that small chance is gone , vanished like Odessa . And we did not even know that she was gone , had , in fact , sat down to eat the supper left warmed on the fire-half against our return , to talk of the futile venture of the last few days , to conjecture on God knows what . Unsuspecting we were , until the darky that sleeps with Jemina came asking for her.  |p70Hughes  went to inquire of his wife  --  who had not risen upon our return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that food had been left for us . I was immediately alarmed , prescience I now know , upon learning that the woman had not seen Jemina since the wench had taken supper to Odessa earlier in the evening . And Hughes ' assurance that Jemina was a good girl , having been with the wife since childhood , did nothing to calm my fears . Such a slight indisposition as his wife evidently had was no reason to entrust the keeping of so valuable a prisoner to another darky who is no doubt only slightly less sly than Odessa herself . I protested thus to Hughes , too strongly I now see , for he replied heatedly that if I did not keep my tongue from his wife , my slight stature would not keep me from a beating . I am firm in my belief that these impetuous words of mine were a strong factor in his early abandonment of the search and I regret them accordingly . There are stronger words in my mind now , but I forebore , at that time , carrying the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , that time was of the essence . But Hughes shall find on the morrow that even one of my slight stature has the means of prosecuting him for criminal neglect . To think of leaving Odessa in the care of another nigger ! Hughes ' darky was , of course , incoherent when was a nigger in excitement ever anything else ?  --  but we finally pieced together , between the darky 's throwing her apron over her head and howling , " Oh , Masa , it terrible ; they was terrible fierce , " and pointing to her muddied gown to prove it , what must have happened . There were three niggers ( she said three the first time ; the number has increased with each successive telling . Perhaps there were only one or two ; I settle upon three as a likely number . These were obviously the niggers with whom Odessa was in league in the uprising on the coffle . I could scream to think that even as we were out chasing shadows , the cunning devils were even then lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she  --  she was so deep asp71to give never an indication that they were then lurking about . Both Jemina and that woman of Hughes ' swear that except for a natural melancholy  --  which in itself was not unusual  --  I have been the only one to succeed in coaxing her into animated spirits  --  there was nothing out of the ordinary in Odessa 's demeanor these last days . And knowing now the cupidity of which she is capable , I must believe them ) . The three bucks overpowered the darky just as she opened the door to the cellar to hand down the evening meal to Odessa . At this point , Hughes ejaculated something to the effect that it was a good thing " my Betty " was not present , at which the darky began what must have been , had I not intervened , a long digression on the " Mist 's ' " symptoms and how she might , at long last , be increasing . But I could feel those niggers gettingfarther away with Odessa , and so could not bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that except for one exclamation from Odessa , of surprise or dismay , she could not tell which , they fled in silence ; swears also that she could not see well enough to describe any of the niggers , save to state that they were big and black and terrible , as though that would help to distinguish them from any of hundreds , thousands of niggers in this world who are equally as big and as black and as terrible . Hughes ' jocular , and inappropriate , prediction that we should find Odessa and her newborn brat for what female as fat gone as she could stand the strain of a quick flight without giving birth to something  --  lying beside the trail within a mile or so proved incorrect . Both the nigger and the one bloodhound Hughes keeps were alike worthless in findingtheir trail . And then the rain came up , driven by a furiouswind , lashing the needlelike drops into our faces ; washing away all trace of Odessa . Hughes , in giving up the hunt , charged that I acted like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for failing in his own lawful duty . But the slut will not escape me . Sly bitch , smile at me , pretend  --  . She wo n't escape me. **p75There was a murmur from the crowd gathered in the torchlit area between the corn cribs and the Great Barn . Dessa looked at Charlie . Ellis , Sara , and Neely , Charlie 's first three choices for his team , stood beside him looking as surprised as she felt . She was young to have been chosen so early . Though she was a steady worker ( " steady sometimes be better than quick , " mammy said , " and it all ways better than flashy " ) , she was not as good at huskingcorn as Harriet , say , or Petey , or any of a number of other people whom Charlie could have chosen . He was probably joking , Dessa thought , trying somehow to show up Alec , the general for the other team of corn huskers . And Alec  --  Alec was obviouslycourting . He had chosen Zenobia at his fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make short work of the huge mound of corn piled in the middle of the area . That kind of funning was usually left until after the best workers had been chosen . " Charlie going try for Youth ' now he done lost Booty , ' " someone called out . People laughed and she hid her own grin in her hands . Charliep76could choose whomever he wanted . Dessa , though young , was no more foolhardy a choice than Zenobia , who was not known for her quickness at any chore , had been . Alec 's side had groaned when he called out Zenobia 's name ; Brud , his second-in-command , had tugged frantically at his arm . Alec had shaken him off impatiently . " This strategy , " he said loudly . " Strategy . " And taking Zenobia 's hand , he pulled her to his side with a sweeping bow . That gesture had really loosened tongues and it was this amazed and ribald tribute to audacity that Charlie had sought to capture for himself in choosing Dessa . He probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older girl hunched her in the side . " Come on over here , baby . " Charlie beckoned to her , then folded his arms across his chest and waited with an air of such evident satisfaction that she was tickled in spite of herself . Still , she hesitated ; maybe Charlie would choose Martha next . And  --  She glanced around . Mammy was sure to think that Charlie had chosenher because she had put herself forward and not because Charlie was just trying to shock people . Dessa craned her neck , her eyes searching among the dark faces , but she could n't tell if mammy were anyplace in the crowd . " Well , if that do n't  --  " Alec slapped his thigh in disgust that no one took seriously . The good-natured wrangling over selections was customary  --  though that , too , usually took place later . Alec 's publiccourting had swept them all into early gaiety . Dessa eyed Zenobia curiously . She was not above average looking , her brown skin rather muddy and , even in the torchlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told anyone who would listen , ass-for-days ( and said like that as one word , it was n't cussing , just repeating what someone else had said . Anyway , she would never say it in front of mammy or any other grown person ; with them it would be Zenobia 's " long booty . " Even this she would not say too often ) . And now that Zenobia was no longer with Jake , Alec was determined to have her . This was common knowledge . Even the children know about it , Dessa thought with a smile as she watched the older woman . Zenobia looked like she was n't studying about anything as shep77stood with her arm casually brushing against Alec 's sleeve . She did jiggle when she walked ; the way her firm buttocks jostled the coarse cloth of her dress was generally admired among the men and envied , at least a little , among the women ( and not just a certain kind , as mammy and Aunt Lefonia maintained ) . Dessa herself preferred Martha 's figure , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high narrow behind seemed to be driving two or three young men on the plantation wild . And there was nothing about Zenobia  --  if you discounted her booty ( and after tonight , no one in the neighborhood would )  --  that Dessa could see that would inspire a man to risk Master 's accusation of playing around with the work . A corn husking was not , strictly speaking , work , true enough . Master provided music and food  --  Jeeter said his stomach itched everytime he thought of the night 's feasting  --  and invited the masters of neighboring plantations to bring their people to the husking . The white folks , of course , danced and feasted at the Big House while the people shucked the corn . The food , the music , the competition over who would be the corn general , over which side would finish shucking its pile of corn first , all these made you want to come . And though some of the more religious people ( for Master served up the persimmon beer in barrels ) and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the white folks , to watch the dancing , everyone knew that all Master 's corn , down to the last rounding , would be shucked beforevictual one was eaten or the fiddler bowed one note . " In that case , " Alec sputtered now , " I wants Martha . " Dessa felt a quick spurt of disappointment ; they would not be on the same side after all . " Booty ' and Beauty . ' This from the crowd amid rising laughter . " Martha ? " Charlie squawked . He was definitely into his act now , playing to the laughing crowd . " Man , how you going choose Martha when Santee ai n't been chosed , and Monroe ; neither Hank ? " " Now , look here , Charlie , you know these two pretty little ladiesdo n't be doing too much of no kind of work "  --  here she started , up : Why Alec want to say something like that , even in fun ? " let alone shucking corn , when they 's right long side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing too much of that even when they ai n't together , " Sara said laughing . Though she and Martha looked indignantly at Sara , Dessa was relieved that the older woman had spoken up . The whole business of choosing sides had come to a halt . She felt torn between pride at being the subject of the men 's fast-talking raillery and mortificationat having her name bandied about before every darky on the place . Mammy would pitch a hissy ( " Another one want to be noted , huh ? Note ai n't never got a nigga nothing but trouble " ) . " Now , you just hold on a minute here , Sara  --  " Alec began . " Aw , man , get on with the choosing . " " Do n't make me no ne ' mind which'n choose me . " Martha spoke for the first time . " I ai n't never been particular about scratching up my hands on no corn husks no way . " Dessa smiled at her whispered commentary . Martha was used to all this ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get next to her . But Martha paid none of them any mind . " Now , if it was Masa . . . " she 'd said once , looking at Dessa sideways out of innocently widened eyes . Dessa had felt a faint brush of fear at the idea . To do that with . . . She had turned away from the thought uneasily and Martha had continued . " Why not ? Least that 'd be one man ca n't be sold way from you . " " Sold way " the words echoed eerily in Dessa 's mind and the brightly lit , laughing faces of the people wavered before her eyes . She heard a clanking noise , her own labored breathing . She stumbledand would have been dragged down by the pull of the ankle chain had it not been for a hand on her elbow . " Oh , drat ! " Martha held out a stubby muscular hand , the nails broken , the skin ashy . She licked a forefinger and rubbed it delicatelyat a roughened place between her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand up so . " Dessa laughed ; Martha could tear up herself . That Robert boy who worked with Luke 's gang in the timber lots came into her mind . Lawd . He was fine and maybe they would end up on thep79same side tonight or at least sitting across from each other . She imagined the pile of corn reduced between them , his face appearingabove it in the moonlight , the pointed chin and little shiny eyes that got lost in the crinkles of his face when he laughed . He had some eyes for looking ; they seemed to follow her whenever she was around him . She could n't see him in the crowd but there was no doubt in her mind that he would seek her out before the eveningwas over . " Come on , girl . " Martha tugged at her arm . " We on Charlie 's side . " She stood a moment , her eyes frantically searching the scene : Someone was missing . They rested a moment on mammy 's wide dark face , her uncovered head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from her head Dessa 's heart beat fastMammy did n't go out without something on her head  --  She turned . . . Jeeter ? Her insides opened up . Jeeter ? Was this the hole in the blackness ? The brother sold southIt was dark ; the square was lit almost as bright as day by flaringtorches and moonlight , but there were shadows on the faces . The people milled about  --  men , women , children ( When I was n't nothing but a chile . . . )  --  oh , someone was missingCharlie and Alec scrambled up the corn pile and finally succeeded in laying the rail across the top of it to everyone 's satisfaction . Last year , the mound had been so lopsided and there had been so much argument back and forth about which side  --  if either  --  were larger that Master had had to divide the pileNo . That had n't happened since she was a real little girl . When Old Master was alive . Master Vaugham did n't get any closer to a shucking than that wagon seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of the people . Blood had crusted on his temple and a cut above his eye oozed wetly . She backed away , her head pounding , suddenly , painfully . . . Masa ? Masa bleed  --  Someone " Slip shuck corn a little while , " Alec gave out . He stood at the top of the pile , hands on his hips , his feet planted solidly in the corn . " Slip shuck corn a little while.  | " Little while , little while I say . " She was a steady worker , picking up an ear with her left hand , stripping it with her right , tossing the shuck onto a pile at her right side and the ear into a basket in front of her . " Slip shuck corn a little while . " Charlie and Alec strode across the pile of corn , shouting encouragement to their teammates , now and then husking an ear of corn with a flourish or dropping down to work and trade words among the shuckers seated around the edge of the mound . And most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topical situation , improvising on an old theme that the singing made new . " Little while I say . " She saw mammy down the line and waved . That Robert boy caught her eye and winked . She dropped her own as Martha nudged her with a sly laugh . ( I was n't nothing but a child " Possum up the gum stump , racoon in the holler ; " Someone was missing " Rabbit in the old field fat as he can wailer . " Maybe it was the torchlight on the faces that made such shadows The people talked and laughed but someone was missing " Nigga in the woodpile ca n't count seven . . . " The twang of the straws beaten against the fiddle strings rose above the sound of shuffling feet . Little Simpson could really handle the straws . Little Simpson was n't nothing but a child " I was grown when I met you . " She 'd said that once in response to some comment of Kaine 's about her bull head and what she would never learn . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child  --  " Oh , Kaine 's fingers like the notes off that banjo on her skin  --  and here they 'd thought that there was n't anything half so fine as Gustus on that fiddle with Little Simpson to beat the straws . " Whee-ee-y000 , whee-ee-yoo . . . " " Gentlemens to the right . " Brud strutted away from her on the call ; she whirled to the left , double-timing on the flight of half notes Kaine played just for her while his heel and toe stomped the syncopatedrhythm to which the rest of them danced " Whee-eee-yoo , whee-ee-y000000 , " he sang above the music and the dancing feet . She rocked back on her hips , clapped her hands , and glided into the turn . Brud 's fingers were light as a feather at her waist and on her fingertips as he guided her through the figure . Whee-ee-y000 , whee-ee-yoo , her heart answered . She snuggledThe raftered ceiling had been whitewashed and recently , the walls , too , and where the sunlight struck them , they gave off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but even behind her loweredlids , she could still see the light striking the white walls and it filled her with terror . Where was this place ? And the white face white ? eyes as gray as glass under arching red brows and lashes . " Harker ? " The name she screamed was dredged up from a place she did n't know existed but she felt safety in the name and she screamed it again and again , her eyes screwed tight against the white walls , against the white face . " Harker . Harker ! Harkerrrrr . . . " The hands were thin and strong ; she could feel the fingers bit/ing into her shoulders as the hands shook her . Harker ? whispered through her mind but . . . Harker 's hands were . . . She did n't know . Harker ? She peeked through partly opened eyes . The white worn --  She could feel a scream , hear it rising and rising as she fought to untangle her arms and legs from covers . The white woman would kill her kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her ba  --  She freed an arm and smashed it into the white woman 's face just as hands grabbed her from behind . She twisted . Black . " Harker ? " But the face did not respond . She raised a leg to kick and the side of her face seemed to explode . She fell back on the bed . " Harker . " It was only a whimper , the last sound she heard before her mind went blank . Dessa watched the white woman . She knew she had lain like thisbefore , body rigid , heart hammering against her ribs , watching the white woman through half-closed lids . The white woman stood at the door . This , too , had happened before . . . maybe . A white woman moving quietly around her bed  --  bed ? ( Feel like it feather , too ! Dessa barely stifled a laugh . Lightheaded in a feather bed . ) She was in a bed , a white woman white stared at her from the shadows of some room  --  She would be still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chest . The white woman passed beyond her line of vision . She heard a soft swish off to her right , someone moving about , a voice talking . She could n't understand a word . This a dream . Her heart slowed , muscles relaxed ; she'fill snuggled . Dessa watched the white woman , who stood now with her backto the door . She lowered her lids even more , looking at the white woman through the spikes of her own lashes ; finally she could no longer see her . A white woman . The image filled her mind , the hair pinned carelessly on top of her head , orange tendrils hanging about the pale blur of the face . She opened her eyes slowly . The face seemed to float toward her . She clenched her hands convulsivelyand was still.  | " I know you-all ai n't doing a thing but playing possum . " The face grinned . Dessa 's mind raced ; she could not put two thoughts together . Oh , why this dream so hard ? Mammy would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Is that your enemies ? ... could be . . . could be " To dream of death is a sign of marriage . ' " The teeth of the comb bit into her scalp as Carrie Mae parted off another thin line of hair . Dessa flinched from the comb and frowned at mammy . Dessa and Carrie sat on the steps that led up to mammy 's cabin door , Carrie Mae on the top step , she on the next step between Carrie 's legs . Carrie 's fingers tugged sharply on each strand of hair as she began the intricate corn row . Sometimesit was so hard to get mammy to talk some sense . That was grief had her bowed down , so Aunt Lefonia said  --  pappy , whom Dessa remembered a little ( did n't she ? somewhere ; when she was little : a prickly cheek against her own small hand , a wide chest against her knees , hard arms supporting her bottom . . . ? ) ; teeter , whom she knew she loved ; that boy and girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was that word again . Mammy had to talk . Dessa turned her head under Carrie 's hands and looked at her mother . She waited . The old woman sat on a three-legged stool in the doorway , her heavy hips and thighs overflowingits seat , arms folded tight against her chest , eyes closed . Maybe she should go see Aunt Lefonia . But Lefonia would only send her back to mammy ; mammy was the one who read dreams . " This a white woman I 'm dreaming of , mammy , not no burying shroud . " Mammy sat on a three-legged stool by the bottom step , head bowed , sucking on the little corncob pipe Jeeter had made for her . Dessa wanted very much to see mammy 's face , the full lips that were the color of ripening blackberries , the broad , pockmarked cheeks and furrowed brow , the large flaring nostrils . The whites of mammy 's eyes were yellowed , the red-brown pupils covered by a milky film . This she knew from memory . Mammy would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of death . ' " " I know that , mammy , " she said patiently . " This a white woman I 'm dreaming of , not no wedding gown . " " Maybe , " Carrie said ; the comb 's teeth bit into Dessa 's scalp again . " Maybe , it 's like silver money ; you think , mammy ? ( Hold your head this way , Dessa . ) " She tapped Dessa on the shoulder with the comb . " You know , Silver money a sure sign of trouble . ' " What a nigga doing dreaming of money , anyway ? Dessa thought impatiently . Course something like that bound to mean trouble . She had never seen a white woman so close  --  the fine red-gold fuzz on the top lip , the lines radiating from the corners of the eyes , the bluish shadow at the temples , the skin as pale as hoecake dough  --  so much detail she could almost think it real . " Mammy  --  ! " Lawd , she wished she could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to her nonsense about the baby 's talking at six months . " Mammy  --  " " ' A bright Christmas mean some white folks going die . ' That the only one I knows . " Martha grinned . ( This was too much , Dessa thought frantically ; Martha would tell her something she did n't want to know . Something mammy would say she did n't need to know . ) " A dark un mean some nigga going go . ' " Martha was laughing now . " But I guess we do n't need no dream to tell that . Girl "  --  Martha sobered  --  " do n't be running round here trying to figure out no dream when you got life right here to get through . " Her skin was the golden brown of an autumn sycamore leaf , with just that much red , stretched smooth and taut over the thin-bridged nose , the delicate nostrils . " Do n't be studying about no dream . " And Martha walked away . " You scrape  --  oh , about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea scrape that much from the horn of a cow ; this is if they real sick with the fever , now . I would n't use this for just every little common heat . But I take the scrapings from the horn , you see , and make that into tea , just pour some hot water on it , honey . Let it steep till it cool , then reheat it and this will cure any fever  --  long as it ai n't determined to kill . Now if the fever determined ... "  | " Mammy , I came about my dream . " Dessa was exasperated . She stood in front of mammy 's cabin . Like all the others in the Quarters , it stood on stilts above the ground . Three rickety steps led up to its lone door . Mammy sat in the doorway on a threeleggedstool . Dessa started up the steps . Mammy was going to tell her something about this dream today . " Never tell a dream until you broke your fast . ' " " Fast ? Mammy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me and Kaine be just down the Quarters , there . " They were insidemammy 's cabin , the dark smoky room where she and Jeeter and Carrie Mae had been raised . A crude fireplace had been arranged in one corner , bricks and a stovepipe that vented the smoke from the fire through a hole in the wall . A rude table and four three-legged stools stood before it . Pappy had finished the last stool just before he 'd hired out that last time . That was before Dessa was old enough to work the fields . She had slipped away from Mamma Hattie as she often did and run off to the spring house . Mammy gave her a piece of cheese and continued churning the butter : swish , creak , squeak , and beneath that a top-pa-ta , toppa-ta , as the stick thumped against the bottom of the churn . The sound of the churn filled the room and mammy 's voice rose above it : " This little light of mine . . . " Dessa rocked herself to the beat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This little light of mine . . . " Dessa chewed and rocked and hardly noticed the creaking of wheels as a wagon lumbered into the yard . Someone had come running , shouting . Mammy had jumped up screaming , knocked over the churn , and slipped and slid in the soft butter and yellowed cream , and screaming had run behind the wagon and the pine box that knocked against the wagon sides . Mammy sat now on one stool , Carrie Mae , a big chicory-brown baby ( . . . baby ? asleep on her shoulder , on another . Dessa sat down on a third . One place was empty . " We be just like Carrie-nem . " Someone was missing " Kaine through with all that foolishness he done when he first come here  --  acting out and talking back . " Someone " Mammy , you going talk to Boss Smith for us ? "  | " Dreaming about dollars is a sure sign of a whipping .

He could make it tinkle like the first drops of spring rain spattering on the roof or sheet like creek water runningover a rocky course . Someone was sweeping her house after sundown , someone was sweeping her out of the family house " Mammy . Mammy . I dreamed  --  " " Put graveyard dirt in your shoes and ca n't no dog track you . ' " She snuggledThe white light the raftered ceiling Dessa had seen this all before . She watched the white woman sitting in the light from the long window . Her hair was the color of fire ; it fell about her shoulders in lank whisps . Her face was very white and seemed to radiate a milky glow ; her mouth was like a bloody gash across it . Dessa closed her eyes . Only the Quarters had been a dream . Mammy , Martha . Kaine 's face danced before her eyes . She was the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bed and these were sheets . She clutched them in her hands . The white woman sat in a rocker across from the bed . Next to her was a large cradle ; next to it another piece of furniture Dessa could n't identify . A large cupboard stood in a corner on the other side of the rocker ; near that corner was a door . Dessa stared at it but could not move . They had come for her at night . Nathan , Cully , and Harker , whom she had n't known . Jemina , praising the Lawd in scared whispers , had opened the cellar door and unlocked her chains . Free , and scrambling up the steep steps , Dess had focused all of her attention on the stranger 's whispered instructions , refusing to thinkp87beyond the next step . She was free and she walked on , mindful of his hand on her arm , uncaring of anything else save his cautions and the putting of one foot in front of the other . Silently , she had thanked the Lawd , Legba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cully and Nathan , for Jemina herself . She would not be a slave anymore in this world . They had walked for a long time , Harker going before her , holding back low branches and vines , his voice whispering the presence of obstacles on the path so she could avoid them . It had taken a while for her feet to remember the gliding shuffle that , slow as it appeared , ate up ground . The coffle had taught her that , just as it had Cully and everyone else who had ever spent more than a day on one . She had learned quickly after the first few hours of hobbling along with the manacle rubbing her ankle raw . She had known without being told that if she fell , one of the drivers would be along with the whip . Her feet were remembering : The muscles of her calves and thighs protested some and it took all of her concentration to keep their protests from drowning out the remembrance of her feet . She did n't speak . She did n't think either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would ever be but she knew , without needing to think about it , that she 'd never be less free than she was now , striding , sometimes stumbling toward a place she 'd never seen and did n't know word one about . She remembered laughing weakly , leaning against the thin mulattoboy , an arm around her , an awkward pat on her shoulder . " ... the midwife back at the farm say less your time real near . . . " ( Farm ? Had he  --  A white woman  --  ) Her own foot in the stirrup , Cully pushing from behind , she mounted the horse beforeHarker . And leaning back against his chest , tears sliding silentlydown her cheek . She had not known how bad she felt , how scared , how  --  She had lost track of place , of time , dozing only to be jostled awake by the dull throbbing in her back , some poundingin her head , starting up out of some unremembered dreams to feel the sinewy arms around her , the beard-stubbled cheek against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . At some point they rested ,  |p88|probably  more than once ; she remembered the sky through a canopyof trees , the smell of roasting meat , " Rest , " her face against some coarse material , the warmth of someone 's flesh and the dull throbbing in her back . She was bumped up and down and something , in her womb , she guessed , somewhere deep inside her , the baby pinched its lining in its fist . It had rained , hard and soaking , and Harker laughed , " There go the trail and the scent , " as he pulled out an oilcloth and draped her in it . But the wetness of the rain was mixed with that other , sudden , drenching liquid that made the horse rear , nearly killing them both , embarrassing her half to death . What would Harker think , her having no more bladder control than this ? And little else : the anxious broad-nosed face , a fiercely muttered " Shush ! " and " Bear down , bear down ! You got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawd , the pain , the blood .. . The white woman 's mouth was like an open wound across the milky paleness of her face . She sat , one shoulder bare , a child held against her breast . " Got enough ? " She tickled the baby under the chin and raised it to her shoulder , patting its back and murmuring . The baby was big , a year old , maybe , or more , with plump white arms and legs , wisps of light-colored hair on its smooth white head . The child burped loudly and grinned ; the white woman laughed . " Well , I guess you did get your fill . " Dessa dosed her eyes ; her lashes clotted wetly against her cheeks . Her stomach was flat , the muscles flaccid ; her breasts , swollen and tender , felt on fire . Lawd , where my baby at ; where is my child ? She could feel the sodden rag between her thighs , sticky with blood . " Where my child ? " She did n't know she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right here . " And opened her eyes . The white woman , the shoulder still bare , the curly black head and brown face of a new baby nestled at her breast , faced her now . " See ? " " Naaaaaawwwww ! " The scream rushed out of her on an ex/plosion of breath . She saw the glass-colored eyes buck before her own squeezed tight . The covers weighed her arms and legs ; some voice screamed , " Annabelle . Annabelle , get Ada ! She starting up again ! " Hands , herself crying weakly , a cool cloth on her foreheadand something at her breasts . " See ? See ? He know his mama . See , he just want to eat . " Dessa looked down . The brown baby was in her arms , his dark eyes staring up at her unwinkingly . She touched a tiny fist ; it opened to grasp her finger . She looked up . She had never seen the tall brown-skinned woman before . " Let me fix them pillows so you can nurse more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands moving deftly . Dessa lay quietlybut warily . " There , now ; you turn just a little on your side and you both be more comfortable . Well , go on ; put the nipple in his mouth . " Dessa looked down quickly , then up at the woman 's smiling face . She did as she was told , gingerly touching her breast and awkwardlyguiding it toward the baby 's mouth . The nipple touched his cheek and he turned his head toward it , his mouth opening to grasp and clamping tightly around it , all in one sudden movement . A sharp pain shot through her breast at the first tug and she gasped . " You got to get used to that , " the woman said conversationally . " Pain going get worse before it get better  --  that is , if you ai n't dried up . It 's a mercy if you not , way you been carrying on . " She laughed . " Attacking white folks and scaping all crost the country in the dead of night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her do n't be coming in here less one of us was with her . But you think Miz Ruint going listen at me ? " At least she could understand these words even if they still made no sense to her . Who was this woman ? Where was " Harker ? " " She sent the boy at him . He be here directly . You go on see at that baby . He getting some , huh ? " she asked , peeking over at the nursing baby . " It be all right , now . " Every pull of the baby 's lips sent a thrill of pain through Des/sa 's breast . She looked up at the woman and smiled before she closed her eyes . Rufel watched the colored girl , not as she had at first from the rocker by the window , rocking gently as she nursed the babies or shelled peas . The colored girl was young . Do n't look no more than twelve or thirteen , Rufel had thought . Could n't be more than fourteen , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She disliked disagreeing with Ada . The older darky had an abrupt way of speaking that Rufel found daunting . Rufel herself was not , of course , a child to be corrected by some middle-aged darky  --  Who knew no more about birthdays , she would continue sullenly to herself , than " planting time " and " picking time . " ' Why , even Mammy had n't known how old she was or even her own birthdate . That was why they she , Rufel , " Miz ' Fel , " had chosen Valentine 's Day as Mammy 's birthday . Mammy had refused to accept a date  --  " This way I do n't have to age , see , " she had joked , " I just gets a little older . " Eyes full and shiny , a smile fluttering about her bee-stung lips  --  Rushing from the wound of that memory , Rufel would silently declare , All darkies know about is old age . Rufel would sew or rock for a minute , until another point occurredto her . Thirteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a darky . Well . Rocking again , maybe sewing , fifteen . But no older and Ada talked about her as if she were a grown woman . Even if the girl were eighteen , as Ada said , she was too young to live as a runaway , hand to mouth , Rufel thought scornfully , like the rest of these darkies . And Ada was no better than the rest of them . Why , any white person that came along could lay claim to them , sell them , auction them off to the highest bidder . They should thank their lucky stars she was a kindhearted person . Bertie  --  But she resolutely closed her mind against the thought of her husband . She had done what she could do . He would see that when he came . Rufel would resume her task , all the while watching the colored girl . If she did n't want to go back to her people  --   |p91The  wench was the color of chocolate and Rufel would stare at her face as she tossed or , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that barely made an impression in the big feather bed . The girl would be all right . Rocking again or returning to the rocker if she had stood as she sometimes did to fetch some article , to stretch , or just to look more closely at the colored girl . Ada and Harker said she  --  they called her Dessa  --  had been sold south by a cruel master . She certainly acted mean enough to have been ruined by a cruel master  --  kicking and hitting at whoever got in the way the few times Rufel had seen her roused from stupor . But the girl 's back was scarless and to hear Ada tell it , every runawayin the world was escaping from a " cruel master . " Ada herselfclaimed to have escaped from a lecherous master who had lusted with her and then planned the seduction of Ada 's daughter , Annabelle . Rufel did n't believe a word of that . She could see nothing attractive in the rawboned , brown-skinned woman or her lanky , half-witted daughter  --  and would have said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , thanking Ada for her help and God that Ada had escaped from her old master . Vexed , Rufel had bit her lip , remembering then what the utter nonsense of the darky 's statement had made her forget . They needed Ada . That was the plain fact of it . Often , misery washed over her . She would struggle against the familiar tide , feeding her indignation at Ada 's story . At least UncleJoel and Dante , the darkies Bertie had brought back from that last trip , had stayed , she would remind herself then . And , forgettingher angry , and silent , exasperation at Bertie 's conviction that he had somehow gotten the best of a deal that netted him an old darky and a crippled one , took some satisfaction in their loyalty to the place . Mammy said they had been some help at harvest , but the real work was done by the darkies Ada knew . Still , Rufel had n't been able to resist pointing out Ada 's lie to Mammy . " No white man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied a sack over her head first , she had continued maliciously to herself . Mammy , folding linen  --  black hands in the white folds , Mammy 's hand against her face , and even then , maybe , that scaly , silveryp92sheen creeping over the rich , coffee-colored skin  --  had paused . " Why , Mammy , that 's  --  " Rufel was n't sure what it was and stuttered . " That 's  --  " " Miz Rufel ! " Mammy had said sharply . " You keep a lady tongue in your mouth . Men , " Mammy had continued with a quailing glance as Rufel opened her mouth , voice overriding Rufel 's attempt to speak , " men can do things a lady ca n't even guess at . " Rufel knew that was true but could not bring herself to concede this openly . " Well  --  " She had tossed her head , flicking back locks of hair that tumbled in perpetual disarray from the artless knot atop her head . " Everyone know men like em half white and whiter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mammy had snapped . " Lawd know it must be some way for high yeller to git like that ! " Shaking out a diaper with a low pop and folding it with careful precision across her lap . " Ada have a good heart and at least she know how to work that danged old stove . " Mammy 's retort about the stove had silenced Rufel . She shared Mammy 's antipathy for the beastly and expensive contraption Bertie had so proudly installed in the kitchen lean-to during the first months of their marriage . Its management had baffled every cook they ever owned ; meals were most often late or the food burned , when the darky could manage to get the fire going at all . None of them had ever understood how to regulate cooking temperatures by sticking a hand into the oven and counting until it had to be withdrawn , the method prescribed by the manufacturer . And it took Mammy 's constant supervision to see that the stove was kept clean and blackening applied to prevent the rust of its many surfaces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the tardy and overdone meals ( often he was not there to share them ) , and usually laughed when Rufel apologized for the quality of the meals set before him . How , he would ask , could she be expected to teach darkies to regulate the temperature of the stove when most of them could n't count beyond one or two ? Still , Rufel felt she had failed in a crucial duty and she was both relieved and piquedp93that Ada seemed to have an instinct where the operation of the stove was concerned . Despite Ada 's considerable skill in the kitchen , Rufel still itched sometimes to throw the lie back in Ada 's face ( White man , indeed ! Both of them probably run off by the mistress for making up to the master ) , but she was glad she had n't provoked Mammy that day . Mammy had probably not believed Ada 's story herself , Rufel thought now , but had not wanted to antagonize Ada . Mammy , perhaps even then foreseeing her own death , trying to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rufel would need that scheming Ada . No , Rufel had concluded , hurrying now lest she be trapped in grief and fear , the " cruel master " was just to play on her sympathy . But  --  maybe  --  there were no people for this wench to return to . Timmy had said the other darkies called her the " debil woman . " His blue eyes had rolled back into his head and he had bared his baby teeth in a grotesque grin as he said it . Repulsed by his mimicry , she had scolded him for the mockery . " But that 's the way they do it , mamma ; and laugh and slap their thighs . " He had imitated that also and she had relaxed , a little surprised at how seriously she had taken the joke . And it was a joke , she told herself , a foolishnickname , " debil woman " ( He talk plain when he with me , she thought defensively ) . What could there be to fear in this one little sickly , colored gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of devil in her , Rufel would think , smiling , remembering the way the girl 's eyes had bucked the first time she awakened in the bedroom , just the way Mammy 's used to when something frightenedher . Mammy , Mammy 's hands in her hair  --  Sudden longing pierced Rufel . Mammy 's voice : " Aw , Miz ' Eel " ; that was special , extra loving , extra . Rufel squeezed her eyes tight . She  --  the colored girl  --  had probablybeen scared out of her wits at finding herself in a bed . Even in her fevered state , she would know that no darky could own a room like this . It was a spacious and light-filled chamber , handsomelyproportioned and stylishly finished from the highly pot/ished golden-oak flooring to the long , French-style windows that faced the morning sun . Even the open-beam ceiling , so long an ugly reminder of that good-for-nothing darky 's unfinished work , seemed , since Mammy had hit upon the idea of painting the rough wood white , almost elegant . The highboy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its three-quarter mirror had come with her from Charleston ; the crib and the half-sized chest had been made by the estate carpenterat Dry Fork as the Prestons ' christening gift for Timmy . She had only to look at these to see Dry Fork again  --  not as she had come to know it during her lying-in with Timmy and the weeks she had spent there regaining her strength , as a bustling , virtually self-sufficient , miniature village , but as she had seen it on her first visit , the year she and Bertie went to Montgomery to buy a cook : the stately mansion built in the English style with an open court in front , the circular carriage drives and broad walks , the gardens opening before it : large flower beds and mounds , empty at that season but since pictured in her mind in a riot of blooming colors , rose , snowball , hyacinth , jonquil , violet . A mockingbird sang perpetuallyfrom bowers of honeysuckle and purple wisteria , perfumedand heavy with spring blossoms . There was no comparison , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't build an establishment like Dry Fork in five or even ten years . Not without slaves , not without " capital . " Unconsciously , Rufel quoted Bertie , and shrugged , impatient with herself . What could a darky have to compare the Glen with ? Certainly it offered a better home than any runaway could hope to have . Even that scheming Ada did n't want to go back out in the wild . And , if the darky was n't from around here  --  No angry owners or slave catchers had descended on the house as Rufel had half expected would happen . She had been in the yard drawing water from the well , because that idiot girl of Ada 's had forgotten to do it , the morning Harker rode in with the girl . She had been startled by the sight of darkies on horses and frightened when she recognizedHarker . What would these darkies steal next ? And : She wouldp95have to say something ; people might not come way out here looking for a chicken or a pig , but somebody would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been as startled as Rufel , but , after the briefest hesitation , had continued walking their horses toward the kitchen lean-to . " Harker . " She had stepped into their path  --  and seen the girl strapped in the litter Harker pulled behind his horse . There was something in the ashen skin , like used charcoal , the aimless turning of the head that had kept Rufel silent . The baby had started to cry , a thin wail muffled by layers of covering . The girl 's eyes had fluttered open and seemed to look imploringly at Rufel before rolling senselessly back into her head . " Go get Ada , " Rufel had ordered without hesitation . " Take her on into the house ; bring the bucket , " she said as she bent to look for the baby . She should n't have done it ; Rufel had been over that countless times , also . If anybody ever found out . If they had been followed . But nothing of that had entered her head as she picked her way carefully up the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girl 's desolate face , the baby 's thin crying  --  as though it had given up all hope  --  had grated at her ; she was a little crazy , she supposed . But she could do something about this , about the baby who continued to cry while she waited in the dim area back of the stairs for the darkies to bring the girl in . Something about the girl , her face  --  And : She  --  Rufel  --  could do something . That was as close as she came to explaining anything to herself . The baby was hungry and she fed him . Or she would imagine herself saying to Mammy , " Well , I could n't have them bringing a bleedingcolored gal in where Timmy and Clara were having breakfast , " wheedling a little , making light . As long as the girl was n't from around here  --  Though it would serve the neighbors right , she thought , resentful now , if the darky did belong to someone around here . Many times as Bertie had gone looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truly , it would not surprise her to learn that some jealous neighbor had been tampering with their slaves , just as Bertie had always said , urging them to run away . Harker and Ada swore the darky was n't from around here . Inp96fact , Harker said the girl was from Charleston . Not that Rufel believedthat for a minute ; Ada had probably put him up to that , hoping to touch Rufel 's heart . But , if the girl were from Charleston . Here Rufel would stop short , hearing once again Mammy 's anxious voice , urging her to write the family , for surely they would send for Rufel to visit , seeing again the glittering ballrooms of her first Charleston season . Usually  --  for if it was n't this longing or memory , it would be some other  --  she would put aside whatever task she worked on , gather up the babies if she had been nursing , and find something in the sitting room that needed doing . No one asked and she rarely thought to question herself after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to the girl 's story than the darkies were telling , and now and then she did wonder briefly what could have forced the girl out into the woods with her time so near . Even in the comfort and splendor of Dry Fork , having Timmy had been an ordeal , and Rufel refused to dwell on the agony of Clara 's birth . Well , darkies did have their own way of doing things and whatever the real story was , it could n't , she thought , amount to much . Rufel sometimes suspected that the girl was the sweetheart of one of the new darkies , and was made uneasyby the idea . They could n't start using the Glen like a regular hideaway , she would think fearfully , and push the speculation aside . The colored girl would wake and tell her story  --  Whether or not she believed it , Rufel , recalling the long hours she had spent with Mammy , talking idly or in companionable silence , thought it would be something to pass the time . Rufel leaned now against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay curled on her side in the big feather bed , facing the door . The colored girl had not stirred at the sound of the closing door and after a moment Rufel continued across the room to the curtained doorway in the adjacent wall . This girl could n't go on acting crazy forever , she thought impatiently , talkingall out of her head , laying up like she was still half dead . Rufel pushed aside the curtain with a swish and entered the narrow antechamberwhere her seven-year-old son , Timmy , slept . It had been her dressing room in the original plan of the house . The boy hadp97slept in the room since early spring and its plain neatness was a sign of his growing independence . He acted more like nine or ten than the eight he would be in November , spending long hours with Uncle Joel and Dante as they tended the stock and garden , with Ada in the cook-shed , or with Annabelle , when she could catch him and there was nothing better to do . She should keep him closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat piles on the open shelves above his makeshift bed , keep him away from the darkies . Send him to the field school at the crossroads  --  But Bertie would return and be mortified to find his son sharing a desk with common red-necks . And where would she get the two dollars a month to keep him there ? I ca n't just keep him cooped up in here with me all day , she thought wearily . And the darkies talked before him as they would not with her ; it was through him that Rufel kept some kind of track of the comingsand goings in the Quarters . She was not entirely convinced that some of those darkies were not Bertie 's nigras taking his continuedabsence as an opportunity to slip back and live free . Neithershe nor Timmy would ever recognize them . Mammy had been the one who knew them all . Finished , Rufel turned and stood in the doorway , peeking between the curtains ; she could just see the top of the girl 's head in the pillows . Rufel shrugged between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she neared the bed . The girl had turned over ; her profile was a sooty blur against the whiteness of the pillow . Her eyes were closed , the lashes lost in the darkness of her face . When open , they looked like Mammy 's , a soft brownblackset under sleepy , long-lashed lids . And big . Once , when Rufelhad had to restrain her , the girl had seemed to look at her , to recognize her . Even as Rufel watched , the girl 's expression had changed to fear and loathing . It was over in a moment . The girl had renewed her efforts to get out of the bed and Rufel had called to Ada for help . Sometimes , when the girl 's eyes fluttered open , their gaze sweeping past her without recognition , Rufel thought she had imagined that momentary expression . And it was silly to suppose the girl had really recognized her , even if she were fromp98Charleston . And never , never had Rufel done anything to anyone to deserve such a look . But to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It had given Rufel quite a turn . She wanted the girl to wake up , wanted to see that look banished from her face . The girl lay unmoving and Rufel continued to the door . It was time for this darky to wake up . Rufel turned as a thought hit her , and , back to the corridor door , eyed the colored girl . Perhaps she had changed her position slightly , but she lay still now under Rufel'sgaze . " You not doing a thing but playing possum , " Rufel said loudly . The girl did not respond and , turning with a flounce , Rufelstepped into the wide central hall , closing the door behind her . The big front door stood open and the wide hall was cool . Rufelcould see Annabelle , Ada 's daughter , through the open parlor door opposite the bedroom . Annabelle sat on the backless lounge near the front window , head bent over the magazine she held in her lap . The girl could n't read a lick , but she would , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old Godey 's Lady 's Books , turning again and again to favorite pictures and staring off into space . " You supposed , " Rufel said loudly as she entered the parlor , " to be folding nappies . " Clean laundry lay piled about on the setteeand chairs ready to be sorted , folded , or ironed , and put away . Annabelle looked up at Rufel 's words and , putting the journal aside , stood . " This'n just start crying , " she said , pointing at the newborn baby , who began the first tentative notes of what Rufel knew to be his hungry cry . Then , pointing to Clara who crawled toward Rufel across the bare wooden floor , face screwed up to cry , " That'n  --  " " And see at these children , " Rufel shouted as she reached for Clara. "  --  been fretting off and on . Spect she hungry , " the girl continuedas though Rufel had not spoken . " Nappies in the chair . " She pointed . " Well , put them away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told everything and she would do just what she was told and no more.  |p99Rufel  wiped at her daughter 's motley face . She would have to speak to Ada , she thought with a tightening of her stomach ; the girl was just too , too  --  slow . That was what Mammy had maintained . Slow and big for her age . Rufel certainly agreed with that last . Ada seemed to tower over both Rufel and Mammy who were themselvessomewhat above average height . Annabelle , whom Ada claimed was no more than thirteen , was already eye level with Rufel . And Rufel could not rid herself of the idea that Annabelle 's slowness was assumed , that the girl somehow used this means to mock her . There had been incidents . Once , Rufel had stood posingin front of the mirror , lifting her hair from her neck , tugging at the waist and bodice of her dress . It was the first time she had taken an interest in her appearance since Mammy 's death and she prattled to the girl , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had lifted both their spirits , and happened to look up in midsentence to see the girl 's retreating image merginginto the shadows of the great hall . Reflected in the mirror , the dusky doorway seemed to yawn at Rufel 's back and she turned , suddenly furious . " Why  --  I 'm telling you more joy and , and happiness , yes ! and excitement , too , than you can ever imagine in that paltry black hide . Nigger , " she started forward , " you come back here . " The girl stopped in the hall so suddenly that Rufel almost ran into her . She retreated a step before the other 's silence . " You . " And then again , this time stronger . " You know you do n't just walk away from a white person without a by-your-leave . " Hands on hips , Annabelle leaned toward Rufel , grinning in her face ; the dark shoots of her tangled hair seemed to writhe in the yellow light from the fan-glass over the door . A thousand imps seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising note of incredulity , " Mistress Fe ! ? Miz Rufel ? " Rufel flushed , hearing the name on the darky 's lips over a suddenpounding in her head . " Miz Rufel " was a slave-given name , discarded by white people when they reached adulthood . Annabellehad put Rufel almost on the same level as herself by its use now , making Rufel appear a child , Young Missy in tantrum , rather than Mistress of the House . Shaking , Rufel screamed , " My namep100is Mistress ' to you ! " and fled before the silent laughter in the girl 's eyes . Shaken and angered by the incident , Rufel had complained to Ada . And Ada , while allowing that the girl was slow and oftentimessilly , had defended her , reminding Rufel in that abrupt way she had that neither of them belonged to her , that in fact they did her a favor by working for her at all ! Outraged , Rufel had wrung from Ada a promise that Annabelle would do better . Annabelle was more civil now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike the girl and hid her own anger behind an elaborate show of patience . And , despite her anger at the way the girl had turned the name against her , she could not break herself of the habit of thinking of herself as " Rufel , " " Miz ' Fel , " the pet name Mammy had given her so long ago . Rufel curbed her temper now and turned to look at the baby . He lay on his back in the bedding-stuffed basket that served him as a daybed . She patted his chest and made soothing sounds at him before turning back to Annabelle , who had not moved during the pause . " After you put away the nappies , " she said carefully , " change the baby and bring him into the bedroom . Do n't forget to wrap him up . " He would be all right until Annabelle came back for him . Clara quieted under the expectation of eating and Rufel retracedher steps to the bedroom . She sat Clara in the crib while she unfastened the bodice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nappies but Rufel ignoredher as she picked up Clara and sat in the rocker . She leaned back in the chair , allowing Clara to accept her nipple , and , feeling the muscles in her back and pelvis loosen , relaxed under the baby'sdeep pulls at her breast . Clara liked to explore , her fingers wondering at Rufel 's dress , her underthings , tracing imaginary patterns across Rufel 's skin . Often when she finished , Clara would lie with her head resting under Rufel 's bosom as she explored herself , her fingers , her nose . The baby let the milk gurgle in her throat and smiled around the nipple when she saw Rufel watching her , in perfect charity with the world . Rufel smiled , too , holding herp101quietly , barely rocking , now and then smoothing wisps of hair from the baby 's face as she continued to nurse . Clara finished and Rufel burped her , talking gently to the child , who was now so sleepy she could barely keep her eyes open . Rufellaid her in the crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come back so quietly that Rufel had scarcely noticedher . Now she handed the infant to Rufel and waited , shiftingher weight from one foot to the other , for Rufel 's dismissal . The girl would now stay  --  except for sneaking off to look at those danged magazines , which not even Ada seemed able to do anything about until Rufel told her to move . " Bring his basket in here , " she told the girl , turning away from her . " You can go sit in the parlor when you finish that . " It would be a relief to have someone around with a little conversation and initiative . She glanced at the colored girl , still asleep , on her back now , and quiet , as she gave the baby her other breast . The new baby suckled with insistent shallow pulls . " Your mammy will have a time when she start nursing you , " she chided him , speaking aloud as she often did when she nursed the babies alone . Sometimes this one stared at her with eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brown folds of his face . Rufel had taken the baby to her bosom almost without thought , to quiet his wailing while Ada and the other darkies settled the girl in the bedroom . More of that craziness , she knew ; but then it had seemed to her as natural as tuneless crooning or baby talk . The sight of him so tiny and bloodied had pained her with an almostphysical hurt and she had set about cleaning and clothing him with a single-minded intensity . And only when his cries were stilled and she looked down upon the sleek black head , the nutbrownface flattened against the pearly paleness of her breast , had she become conscious of what she was doing . A wave of embarrassmenthad swept over her and she had looked guiltily around the parlor . Annabelle was settled in a corner , oblivious to everythingbut the page of the journal in her lap ; Timmy , she realized with relief , had slipped out soon after breakfast . No one would ever know , she had assured herself , and , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a baby . Lulled as she always was by the gentle rhythm and spent by the drama of the morning 's events , she had dozed  --  and awakened to the startled faces of Ada and Harker . Their consternation had been almost comic . Ada had stuttered and Harker had gaped . In the pause Rufel had recovered her own composure , feeling somehow vindicated in her actions by their very confusion . She had confounded them  --  rendered Ada speechless . Still , she had felt some mortification at becoming wet nurse for a darky . She was the only nursing woman on the place , however , and so continued of necessity to suckle the baby . Whatevercare she might have had about the wisdom of her action was soon forgotten in the wonder she felt at the baby . The baby had lost what Timmy called his bird look , the grayish sheen over his skin that Ada said was common to newborn darkies . His color had been blotchy , pale patches of nut-shell brown , darker patches of chocolate , red , even green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Timmy had laughed . He was as fascinatedwith the baby as Rufel , taking an interest in him that he had never shown in Clara , wanting to measure him , to watch when he was bathed or changed , to wake him if he were asleep , to hold him if he were awake . She herself liked to watch the baby as he nursed , the way he screwed up his face and clenched his fist with the effort , the contrast between his mulberry-colored mouth and the pink areola surrounding her nipple , between his caramel-coloredfist and the rosy cream of her breast . " Where my baby at ? " Startled , Rufel looked up . The colored girl had risen on one elbowin the bed and was watching Rufel . " Why  --  Why  --  " Rufel said , rising from the chair thinking , Finally . About time this girl woke up . " He right here , " she said smiling , bending her arm so that the girl could see him better . The movement dislodged the baby 's mouth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the girl , rocking the baby in her arm . " Here 's your baby right here . " She could see the girl 's body stiffening , her hands fumbling at the covers as she tried to rise fromp103the bed . " Annabelle , " Rufel called shrilly , " Ada ! This girl starting up again . " Sutton 's Glen was not the largest property in the district no one really knew what that was . Much of the land along the Witombe River ( thought to be some of the best in northern Alabama ) was undeveloped , owned , it was rumored , by various eastern interests that expected to make a killing when the market was right and so refused all fair offers for the land . People pointed to the sparse settlement in the neighborhood as proof of this allegation , implyingthat their own residence in the area had been achieved through the hardest work . There had been , over the years , a few attempts to cultivate cottonon a large scale along the river ( generally forgotten when the " stranglehold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none had survived beyond a few seasons . Worms two years running were said to have proved the undoing of several ; rust , a malnourishmentof the stems and leaves that often plagued cotton , the undoingof others . Travelers on the Great Road between the river port at Iverton , on the south , and Double Springs , the county seat to the north , might see an occasional white frame house in the dells or on the hilltops that dotted the rugged landscape ; more often the dwellings were log huts of one or two rooms . Even these were not numerous . Most of the holdings in the county were small , some no more than forty or fifty acres . Sutton 's Glen , with almost two hundred of its five hundred acres cleared for cultivation , was thus a substantial property . The Great House at the Glen sat some six miles from the Road in a small meadow above Ives Creek , and was known in the neighborhood for its fancy cook-stove ( the first in the neighborhoodwith a removable ash-box and a built-in tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanlight and double windows that graced its front  --  Not that many in the neighborhood had seen the House close up . There was bad blood between Sutton andp104several of his neighbors , though few now remembered the ins and outs of the original quarrels . Whatever the initial fault , Sutton 's high-handed manner in these disputes  --  it was rumored that he had once tried to whip a white man off his place  --  had served to alienatemost of the neighborhood . Sutton had never encouraged visits , anyway , and had always eschewed the harvest " bees " and the house and barn raisings that provided most of the opportunities for socializing in the area . The charitable , mostly women who thought Sutton a handsome , albeit mysterious , figure , called him reclusive , and wondered that his wife put up with such habits . Others , and these were in the majority , declared the Suttons wouldbeswellheads , victims of " planter fever " : that flashy House , they muttered , and passel of niggers in a region where there were few slave holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three slaves , all that land planted in cotton when any fool could see this was corn country . Sutton had stuck it out longer than most , so popular wisdom ran , but the hill country did not take kindly to cotton culture  --  nor its people to the " hoity-toity " ways of those who planted it . The Suttons were seen so seldom that folk in the district could go from one season to the next without giving them so much as a thought . They bought provisions in Iverton , bypassing , so it was claimed , Barton 's Emporium at the tiny crossroads hamlet some nine miles from the Glen , to make the longer trek into town for even the smallest purchase . Few now recalled the last time they had attended the occasional church services held by itinerant preachers at the crossroads store . Now and then , a hunter or traveleron the Elmira-Dexter track , which ran within five miles of the Glen , might notice woodsmoke curling above the trees in that general direction , and mention this at one or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased , over the years , to draw much response . The long double windows at the Glen faced east toward the steep , wooded slope that formed the eastern bank of Ives Creek as it snaked through Sutton land . Hills rose behind it , heavily timbered , stretching without break to the far horizon . Often Rufel ,  |p105as  she sat in the rocker by the windows , fancied that sunlight danced briefly at a pane of glass . The tail of a curtain fluttering through an open window in the breeze might catch some traveler'seye . The Georgian facade of the House would gleam whitely through the trees , as fleeting as a dream , lost from sight as the Road dipped , the river curved , hidden again by the trees . That was Sutton Glen as Bertie had first described it to her in Charleston , his lilting voice holding her mesmerized so that she saw what he saw and loved it , she thought , as he loved . " If you was to take a ride on that river . .. " The daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shyly engaging manner made her generally well liked , Rufel had been expected to do well for herself  --  not a brilliant match ( that would be for her younger sister , Rowena , the beauty in the family , to make ) , but someone with prospects . She could not , as the saying went , look as high as she chose  --  her father , Benjamin Carson , was the junior partner in his uncle 's cotton factorage ; the firm itself was up and coming rather than established . Still , her father and Uncle Carson would come down handsomely with whomever she chose to marry . The son of some up-country planter come to town for the racing season perhaps , or one of the aspiring young lawyers in the city , a doctor from one of the outlying counties  --  someone would approach her father soon . If not this season , then the next . Bertie had made that " someone " seem as dull as dishwater . They met at the come-out ball of Abigail Sorenson , in Rufel 's only seasonin Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year and Rufel and Bertie had literally run into each other in the crush . He had caught his foot on the hem of her gown ; she had narrowly missed spilling punch on him . They had both taken the mishap in good part , Rufel nervously good-natured , somewhatawed by the handsome stranger . He had worn no hat , of course , but his bow when he introduced himself gave the impression , even in the press of bodies , that he had just swept one off . When Rufel discovered a small rip at the waistline of her gown , he offered to convey her to her mother . Rufel , who had felt ratherp106lost in the crowd where she knew few people and those only slightly , had been flattered by his solicitude and gratefully accepted . He had chatted amiably as he wove their way expertly through the crowd and , under the gentle flow of his conversation , she had relaxed . She never remembered afterward just what they had talked of as they strolled through the ballroom ; he was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she . But he was obviously someone ; she could tell that by the way he dressed and his soft drawl . He courted Rufel through the rest of the spring , not assiduously at first , he was too well bred for that . But they met often at subscriptionballs and now and then at one of the large private partiesthat highlighted the racing season in Charleston . He teased and flattered her , but always with a subtle deference that made her feel older than her seventeen years , and fragile as though she might break from rough handling . In his more serious moments , he told her of the Glen , the mansion he was building above the river , and the virgin land he was plowing . Blousett County boasted no city as fine as Charleston  --  few areas did , he added with a quick smile . But northern Alabama was not a wilderness or frontier . There were towns and roads . Not many people , he admitted with a wry grin that went straight to her heart : " We have every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobering . That would come , of course  --  pushing back the shock of brown hair that was wont to curl on his brow . And the Suttons would be part of it ; earnest , emphatic on this point . At first she could n't believe that he had singled her out , could think of nothing about herself that would attract him . Later , this very circumstance became proof of his love . Under Bertie 's gaze , her rather carroty hair became flame , the freckles across her nose and cheeks , a golden veil . Finally , he had declared himself : She could be the wife of some bumpkin or mistressof FitzAlbert Sutton 's heart . Charleston meant nothing to her then . To stay and be married off to some younger son seemed , under the spell of Bertie 's highflownspeeches , a fate worse than death . Mrs. Carson , for whom there was no better reference than to be accepted within the no/toriously closed circle of Charleston society , needed little persuasion . Some of the best families in South Carolina had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed on easy terms with many of them . More familiar with the vagaries of cotton cultivation , Mr. Carson and his uncle were less enthusiastic . They had hoped to see Rufel married closer to home  --  to a man of property , to be sure , but one also less dependent on the land than the runof-the-millplanter . Even had Alabama been the scene of fierce Indianfighting , Rufel would have gone with Bertie . Her father and Uncle Carson had yielded to her mother 's arguments and her own tearful pleas ; she and Bertie were married and sailed for Alabama at the end of the spring . This was the story Rufel told herself as she sat in the rocker by the windows , looking at the trees , rocking as she nursed the babiesor shelled peas , or simply sat , rocking gently . Sometimes she relived her first trip to Montgomery , the ball the Prestons had given at Dry Fork in their honor , their annual trips to the cotton market at Mobile ; even the summer after her second miscarriage , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became one of a gay succession of amusements that she re-created in loving detail , lingering over isolated images : the great hall at the Glen as she had first seen it from the threshold , held aloft in Bertie 's arms , so wide she 'd thought it a room , high-ceilinged , oak-floored , an elegant stairway at its end ; sunlight slantingacross the black and white tile in the bathhouse at Dry Fork ; a steamboat on the river , majestic as a dowager , chaste as a maiden by day , a torrid beauty by night ; droopy vermilion flowers planted in the doorway of some rude cabin along the banks of the Black River . More often she recalled some scene from her season in society , an oversubscribed luncheon at the Jockey Club during the racing meet , an afternoon musicale in the garden of some stately home , the ballroom at the Sorensons ' ( a real one , not the double parlor that served for dancing in the houses of most of her friends ) , opening out onto a veranda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chill darkness a welcome retreat from the heatp108and light , the music and laughter of the big overcrowded room . This was how she remembered her courtship , a lighted room , heat , noise , herself and Bertie strolling somewhere in the throng . She had not always longed for Charleston , nor missed the companythat seldom came . There had been the trips  --  their anticipationand recollection  --  and Timmy , born in the second year of their marriage , the ordering of the household ; Rufel sketched a little , hooked rugs , sewed . In the days spent with Mammy , her treasured " weddin gif , " she recalled the glittering scenes again and again , knitting them firmly into the commonplace fabric of their days . There had been the inevitable disappointments and sorrows . They had never gotten far enough ahead to complete the second story , never had much luck with slaves , ill health and runaways plaguingthem so they never had more than eight at a time  --  not countingMammy and whoever was acting as Bertie 's man . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazing rights . They resented the fences Bertie put up to protectthe cotton fields from the hogs and cattle that habitually roamed at will in the neighborhood . He accused them of harboringhis slaves , even encouraging them to run away . Rufel had miscarriedtwice after Timmy was born , and somehow they had lost touch with the many friends met on excursions outside the county and with her family . Rufel never , even in her most private thoughts , referred to the four-year-old estrangement from her- family as more than having lost touch . Someday , she told herself , she would write her mother and set the record straight , refute those malicious slanders against Bertie and herself . Perhaps she and Bertie had been a bit free in asking money of her father and Uncle Carson in the first years of their marriage . Even big plantation owners were often short of hard cash and waited upon the harvest to purchase ready-made goods or pay for services . Her mother just never understood how much it took to establish a decent living in these backwoods . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the exorbitant sums her mother had mentioned in that last hateful letter . Four orp109five thousand dollars , indeed ! And the second story still no more than a Georgian front and an empty , slant-roofed shell , the ktichen barely a lean-to covering that monstrous cook-stove . They could not have borrowed so much in just four years of marriage . And whatever the correct sum , her father must have known that Bertie would repay it as soon as they were on their feet . It was all , of course , a stupid misunderstanding , which though hurtful , Rufel would have been ready to forgive , had it not been for the libelous names her mother had called Bertie , scoundrel , wastrel , gambler . All of this caused by Rufel 's request for some trifling sum whose purpose she could n't now even remember . Rufelhad brooded over that letter in secret . It seemed to reveal a mean and petty side of her mother 's nature that she herself had sometimes suspected but always excused ; she could not bring herself to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To do so seemed somehow to give validity to those stupid charges . In truth , she cared more for the consequences of the letter than for the content of the letter itself . She could not now hope to visit Charleston with her family 's help . But someday , she told herself , when they were on their feet , she would write her mother ; she would see the record set straight . These were the dreary parts of the story and Rufel tried never to tell herself those . She did not sneer at the neighbors as Bertie did , but she knew them to be rough and uncouth . The women , as Bertie maintained , were dowds , for the most part , and gossips . Now and then  --  always unbidden and fleeting  --  she had thought , as Mammy had more and more frequently muttered aloud , that there ought to be something more showing on the eastern horizon than a bird lifting above the trees . And always , close upon the heels of that feeling , silencing that vagrant thought as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertie had wrested a good livingfor them out of these backwoods . Rufel had never had to turn her hand to more than an occasional piece of sewing or the soil in a flower bed . She knew Bertie had bought her leisure at some cost and she would not criticize him . Worms , spreading from a new field into the established cottonp110acreage in the fifth year of their marriage , had devastated the harvestand come close to wiping them out . Bertie had proposed an extended business tirp , like the shorter ones he went on once or , more frequently now , two or three times a year . Most often he had returned with a little of the ready money they were always so short of . He traveled the rivers , the Mississippi , the Missouri , and Ohio , where , he said , northern capital met southern enterprise and made " deals , " made cash money . Rufel had only a hazy idea of what Bertie was talking about , something , she thought , like what her father and Uncle Carson did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buying and selling of goods . And this was only to tide them over , to make ends meet until more land could be cleared , more cotton planted . Bertie had returned before the last cotton picking , with money , a bolt of watered silk for her , a saddle and the crippled darky for Timmy . Their own harvest had been smaller  --  not enough land planted to cotton , Bertie had explained ; they would remedy that come spring . And he had gone again in the slack time between the last chopping and the first picking of the cotton , back to the river , to get capital to feed the land . Mammy had n't liked it . Rufel was expecting ; she had miscarried twice and had a hard time with Timmy before that . There was n't a decent driver on the place and the responsibility for directing the half-wild negroes who then worked their fields would fall largely to her . But Rufel could not bring herself to say no ; Bertie was always so sure and she was , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done her some good , she had laughed , pleased to be pleasing Bertie , who thought it so important that he go . Had he not gone the last time , she told herself , they would scarcely have made it through the winter , even Mammy could see that . It had laddered like a stocking ; four of the six hands had taken off soon after they finished stripping the corn fields in August ; the baby , Clara , had come early and hard . Bertie had not come at all . Perhaps , as Mammy said , he had gone too far north in search of business , been caught there when a river iced over . Rufel had no clear idea of geography and was calmed by Mammy 's confidence.  |p111She  had , as Mammy often reminded her , a healthy baby girl ; they had taken care of the harvest  --  though what Master Bert would say about how they had done it , using runaways . Mammy laughed , sure that Bertie would see the joke they had played on the neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payback , Bertie would call it , for all the Sutton slaves these shiftless farmers had helped escape . Rufel worried less about Bertie 's reaction than her neighbors ' , though Mammy assured her that none of the darkies were from the area . Her fears that she would be denounced or arrested for harboring runaways receded as autumn wore on , but she was never as sanguine as Mammy about the arrangement with the runaways . True , they seemed to work with a better will than darkies on the place had ever done ; but she could not like Ada , the rawboneddarky whose aid Mammy had enlisted when Rufel 's labor with Clara had proved so long and difficult . Ada had stayed on to cook ; Annabelle was to help in the House . The darkies had lightened Mammy 's load considerably but Rufel sensed something sly in the way they seemed to avoid her , and secretly fretted that Ada seemed to take up so much of Mammy 's time . Rufel had nothing much to do with the four or five other runaways who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements were necessary  --  but she could not rid herself of the suspicion that , having run away from one place , these darkies would run away from the Glen , too . Rufel got into the habit , as she nursed Clara , of sitting by the window , rocking gently , watching the trees . She thought then of Charleston , began to speak of it with hesitant longing as she sat and watched the trees . She did not think , as Mammy teased her at first , that Charleston would appear on the eastern horizon , but she hungered for the city of her come-out with a strength she tried guiltily to conceal . Mammy , concerned and fearful at Rufel 's lingeringlethargy , urged Rufel to try one of the foul-tasting teas Ada swore would help a new mother regain her strength . Ada , Mammy told Rufel , might , if asked , stay on when the master returned . As if Bertie were due back any minute ! And she spoke casually ofp112Rufel 's deepest fears : It was sure bad of Master Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't spare him her tongue when he returned . Her calm certainty that he would return bolstered Rufel 's own faltering belief . Bertie , she told herself as she gazed out the windows , would be homebound as soon as the river up north thawed in the spring . Rufel remembered hardly anything of that winter ( and felt a faint surprise , if she thought of it , that she had no recollection of privationor even scrimping ) , except that she had been miserable . She had paid little attention to the preparations for spring planting until Mammy began to talk of it . They should marl the cotton fields and put manure on them ; they should rotate the crops , putting corn where Bertie had always planted cotton ; put in oats or hay or peas ; expand the potato field . Plant less cotton altogether . Rufelhad been uneasy as the suggestions diverged more and more from Bertie 's practices , but Mammy , citing as justification the experience of the new darky , Harker , who had wandered into the Glen sometime during the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled by the larger questions of crop management that were implicit in these changes and found it easierin this , as in so much else , to rely on Mammy 's judgment . A cold had settled into Mammy 's chest at the tail end of spring . It had seemed nothing serious at first and Rufel , roused at last from lethargy and anticipating Bertie 's return any day , had enjoyed pampering Mammy , playfully bullying her into drinking Ada 's noxious brews . The cough had worsened and with frightening suddenness , Mammy died . Rufel could not get used to that fact . Nothing in the days and weeks since Mammy 's death had filled the silence where her voice used to live . Bertie would not return . Rufel never voiced this fear aloud or even phrased it to herself . It had been unthinkable to say when Mammy lived ; it was impossiblenow that Mammy was dead . Who would scold her or laugh away her fears ? But they were there , darting into consciousness . Only Charleston kept foreboding at bay , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her dull days and the neverendingtrees.  |p113Rufel  herself had never seen Sutton Glen through the trees . Oh , she had imagined the elms that would someday line the lane from the Road to the House , their branches meeting overhead , the House standing squarely at lane 's end . But Ives Creek was too narrow , its course too winding for convenient travel and the House was n't visible from the Road . She had come to understand these things silently as she nursed Clara and stared out the windows or simply sat singing tunelessly . It was like being swallowed up by the forest , she thought , wanting Charleston again with all her heart . Like the forest had swallowed up everything east of Ives Creek : " If you was to take a ride . . . " Yet , she would tell herself , even now , as far as she knew , there was a spot  --  on the opposite slope , say  --  where just so much of the House was visible , just so much and no more . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else might see from some distant perspective . She looked out upon the barely kept yard , the slopes rising beyond it , the changing light , changing colors , the empty sky . The trees grew fat , got lean ; some water glinted silver , imagined among the trees . And now she watched the colored girl . The days drifted by . Dessa slept , waking to the colored woman 's gruff urgings to " eat . Eat , " the taste of some strongly flavored broth , the mealy texture of cereal , thinned she thought with milk , the changing of the bloody cloth . Acutely embarrassed and weak as a kitten , she bore the woman 's gentle touch . Often she woke to find the baby asleep in the curve of her arm and , hand heavy , powerless to caress him , she pursed her lips and breathed him love ... Or opened her eyes to some smiling face  --  dark , peach-colored , hair like night or the sun  --  whose name she ought to know . She would grin feebly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . Cully . But already they were gone . The colored woman chatted in a companionable way as she tended Dessa . Not enough to require an answer or force Dessa to questions , but she did listen , her mind holding enough to know the baby was doing well ; the white woman meant no harm ; shep114could sleep . She did not dream but she became cautious in her waking . The white woman seemed often in the room and Dessa woke , now and then , to find her settled in the rocker , hands quiet in her lap , dreamy-eyed , looking toward Dessa but apparently talking to herself . " . . . bonnet . . . " Dessa heard several times . Half-listening , fascinated , she watched the red mouth move . She knew she could understand what the white woman said if she would let herself . But if she understood the white woman , she would have to . . . have to , have to do  --  Something And  --  " ... picnic , " the white woman said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick nits ? Or was that something else only white folks did ? She peered at the white woman ; her dress looked neat enough . So they had bugs , just like some trashy buckra or freshwater negro who did n't know enough to keep clean . " Mammy . . . " That made no sense . Mammy 's name came up often . What could this white woman know of mammy ; or mammy of " dropped waists " and " Dutch sleeves "  --  unless these were cows ? Once she woke in arms , her face tangled in a skein of fine webbingthat seemed alive , it clung and itched her skin so bad . She almost suffocated in her terror for she knew the white woman held her and they were together in the big feather bed . And , really , it was the white woman 's breathing that saved her , brought her to her senses ; its calm regularity imposing order on her own wildly beating heart . That breathing , punctuated by a drawn-out sigh of utter satisfaction and the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving with infinite patience , she inched herself and the baby toward the edge of the bed . Squirming carefullyinto the soft mattress she managed to nudge out a slight rise between herself and the other woman who , still breathing regularly , had likewise turned away . What kind of place had she come to ? she thought as her heart thudded against her ribs . Her fingers touched briefly the satiny hair , the thin velvet of her baby 's skin . It was a long time before she slept again . The colored woman 's name was Ada , Dessa realized one morning . The long windows had begun to gray with dawn light . Nop115conch or bell sounded here ; people must get up with the rooster 's crow . This was the Sutton place except Master Sutton was n't here . Ada called the white woman " Miz Ruint . " There was something funny about the way Ada said the name , as though  --  Was the white woman crazy ? Dessa sweated ; the thin stuff of her shift clung to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never in her life owned cloth as fine as the material her hand rubbed against her side . She moved uneasily between the unbelievable smoothnessof the sheets . The white woman 's breathing was barely audiblein the stillness . Maybe she was crazy , Dessa thought , but not a killer . No , not a killer . Nathan and Cully would not have brought her here . Not a killer but touched , maybe ; strange in the head . What else could explain her own presence in this bed ? Touched ; and Ada said , Miz Ruint said the master was coming home this harvest for sure . The other woman had laughed quietly . Ada said the white woman had said the same thing about the master 's return last year and he had n't come . Dessa remembered that ; Ada had rolled her eyes as if to say  --  Dessa could n't quite put her finger on it . Crazy  --  maybe , she assured herself now , but not no killer . Ada spoke also of " Dorcas . " In her mind 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmounted by a tangle of even darker hair . No . That was Annabelle , Ada 's daughter , seldom seen and then only briefly , a slender figure who hummed quietly and showed no interest in Dessa . Dorcas was someone Ada quoted , someone Dessa did n't think she had yet seen . Never mind , she told herself . Her hand moved to soothe the baby . There had to be someplace else to sleep . She would ask Ada . Neither Ada nor her daughter belonged to the white woman ; none of them did . Ada 's words plucked at Dessa 's attention . Ada 's face beneath her bandanna was placid and Dessa wondered if she had heard right . Free ? Dessa wondered silently , as she watched Ada stir the bowl she held . Dessa tried to gesture but her hand fell limply to her side . She swallowed . " Yo'all  --  " she croaked . Ada paused with the spoon halfway to Dessa 's mouth . " Free ? " she said smiling , brown eyes looking closely at Dessa as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cat let loose your tongue , huh ? Come on , it just a bit more . " She stirred the remaining grits and lifted another spoonful toward Dessa . " Come on ; eat up . " Dessa opened her mouth obediently . The grits had been thinned with milk and seasoned with butter and Dessa held the spoonful in her mouth savoring the richness . " I would n't zactly call it free , " Ada said , doubtfully . " We runned away , " she added brightly , as though this explained it all . " She let us stay here ; she need the he'p . Man gone ; slaves runned off . " Ada shrugged and smiled . " White folks think we hers but did n't none of us never belong to this place . " She spooned the last of the cereal into Dessa 's mouth and rose . " Ada . " Dessa managed to grasp a fold of the woman 's skirt . " Ada , sleep with you ? " She struggled to one elbow , then fell back weakly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Me and the baby ? " She could n't spend another night in the white woman'sbed . " Honey . " Ada bent over her , eyes warm with concern . " Honey , me and Annabelle sleeps in that little lean-to they calls a kitchen ; it just barely big enough for us and it ai n't no wise fitting . You ai n't even out of childbed  --  " " Quarters , we could  --  " " Worse than a chicken run . " Ada sat on the bed , stroking Dessa'shand . " Tell you , honey , these some poor white peoples . Oh , this room and the parlor fine enough , but you know what 's outsidethat door ? A great big stairway lead straight up to nothing cause they never did finish the second floor . " She laughed . " The Quarters ' is a cabin , one side for the womens , one side for the mens . ' Sides , " she added when Dessa would have protested further , " she the only nursing woman on the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby here . " Dessa had suspected from the way the baby turned from her , fretting and in tears , that she had no milk to speak of . Her baby , nursing  --  Her breathing quickened and her heart seemed to pound in her ears . There was more , but Dessa turned away . Ada talked as much to herself as she did to Dessa , almost in thep117same way that the white woman did , never really expecting an answer . Already she seemed to have forgotten that Dessa had spoken . Dessa surrendered to the familiar lassitude . Runaways . Ada , Harker , how many others ? And the white woman let them stay , nursed  --  Dessa knew the white woman nursed her baby ; she had seen her do it . It went against everything she had been taught to think about white women but to inspect that fact too closely was almost to deny her own existence . That the white woman had let them stay  --  Even that was almost too big to think about . Sometimesit seemed to Dessa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . There was a small mole on the white woman 's forehead just above one sandy eyebrow . She smelled faintly of some scent that Dessa could n't place . Why had they all run here ? Becauseshe let them stay . Why had she let them stay ? " ... behind . She was that put out about it , too . " The white woman was sewing this time , setting big , careless stitches in a white cloth draped over her knees . Against her will Dessa listened . " .. . night of the Saint Cecilia dinner and of course Mammy had to dress mother for that . " No white woman like this had ever figured in mammy 's conversations , Dessa thought drowsily . And this would have been something to talk about : dinner and gowns  --  not just plain dresses. " ... all by myself . And scared , too  --  the Winstons was related to royalty or maybe it was only just a knight . " The white woman paused a moment . " Now , often as Daphne told it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She shook her head and laughed softly . " Mammy would know it . " Maybe , Dessa thought , with a sudden pang , Mammy had n't " known " about Kaine , about Master selling Jeeter .. . " ... Mammy doubted that , when it all happened so long ago was n't no one alive now who wimessed it . " I seen it , Dessa started to say . Master sold Jeeter to the trader same as Mistress sold me . But the white woman continued withoutpause. " ... the pretty clothes . Well , I know Mammy did n't know a thing about history , but I knew she was right about the clothes.  |p118She  used to dress me so pretty . Even the Reynolds girls  --  and their daddy owned the bank ; everyone said they wore drawers made out of French silk . They used to admire my clothes . " Dessa stared at the white woman . She was crazy , making up this whole thing , like , like " ... pretend their clothes came from a fashionable modiste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something Mammy ran up for me . ' So when I walked into the great hall at Winston , I had on a dress that Mammy made and it was Mammy 's  --  " " Was n't no mammy ' to it . " The words burst from Dessa . She knew even as she said it what the white woman meant . " Mammy " was a servant , a slave ( Dorcas ? ) who had nursed the white woman as Carrie had nursed Young Mistress 's baby before it died . But , goaded by the white woman 's open-mouthed stare , she continued , " Mammy ai n't made you nothing ! " " Why , she  --  " The white woman stopped , confused . Hurt seemed to spread like a red stain across her face . Seeing it , Dessa lashed out again . " You do n't even know mammy . " " I do so , " the white woman said indignantly , " Pappa give her  --  " " Mammy live on the Vaugham plantation near Simeon on the Beauford River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say if some white person asked them ; their name and what place they belonged to . The white woman gaped , like a fish , Dessa thought contemptuously , just like a fish out of water . Anybody could make this white woman 's wits go gathering . " My , my  --  My Mammy  --  " the white woman sputtered . The words exploded inside Dessa . " Your mammy '  --  " Never , never had that white baby taken Jessup 's place with Carrie . " Your mammy ' ! " No white girl could ever have taken her place in mammy 's bosom ; no one . " You ai n't got no mammy , ' " she snapped . " I do  --  I did so . " The white woman was shouting now , the white cloth crushed in her trembling hands . " All you know about is this kinda sleeve and that kinda bon/net ; some party here  --  Did n't you have no peoples where you lived ? Mammy ' ai n't nobody name , not they real one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to cry and the white woman made as if to rise and go to it . Dessa 's voice overrode the tearful wail , seeming to pin the white woman in the chair . " See ! See ! You do n't even not know mammy 's ' name . Mammy have a name , have children . " " She did n't . " The white woman , finger stabbing toward her own heart , finally rose . " She just had me ! I was like her child . " " What was her name then ? " Dessa taunted . " Child do n't even know its own mammy 's name . What was mammy 's name ? What  --  " " Mammy , " the white woman yelled . " That was her name . " " Her name was Rose , " Dessa shouted back , struggling to sit up . " That 's a flower so red it look black . When mammy was a girl they named her that count of her skin  --  smooth black , and they teased her bout her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled like cow milk and her mouth was slick as butter , her kiss tangy as clabber . " " You are lying , " the white woman said coldly ; she was shaking with fury . " Liar ! " she hissed . Dessa heaved herself to her knees , flinging her words in the white woman 's face . " Mammy gave birth to ten chi'ren that come in the world living . " She counted them off on her fingers . " The first one Rose after herself ; the second one died before the white folks named it . Mammy called her Minta after a cousin she met once . Seth was the first child lived to go into the fields . Little Rose died while mammy was carrying Amos  --  carried off by the diphtheria . Thank God , He spared Seth . " Remembering the names now the way mammy used to tell them , lest they forget , she would say ; lest her poor , lost children die to living memory as they had in her world . " Amos lived for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not another one lived till she had Bess . " Mammy telling the names until speech became too painful . " Them was the two she left , Seth and Bess ; Seth was sold awayp120when she come with Old Mistress to the Reeves place . Sold away like Jeeter , whose real name was Samuel after our daddy  --  only Carrie kept saying Jeeter when she meant Junior and that was the name he kept . Bess , born two years before Old Mistress married Old Master Reeves ; left cause she was sickly ; died before Rose reached her new home . " Even buried under years of silence , Dessa could not forget . She had started on the names of the dead before she realized that the white woman had gone . Both children were crying now but Dessa'svoice continued through their noise : " Jeffrey died the first year she come to the Reeves plantation ; Caesar , two years older than Carrie : head kicked in by a horse he was holding for some guest . Carrie was the first child born at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby girl . " Anger spent now , she wept . " Oh , I pray God mammy still got Carrie Mae left . "  |p121How  dare that darky ! Seething , Rufel blundered blindly out of the back door , slamming it behind her . She went quickly down the steep steps , pushing roughly past Ada  --  who had just set foot on the bottom step  --  without a word . Wench probably do n't know her own name and here she is trying to tell me something about Mammy . She strode across the yard , automatically turning down the path to the stream . Uppity , insolent slut ! Ought to be whipped . And if she was mine , I 'd do it , too , she thought venomously . She took the faint path to the left and entered the thin strand of trees that boarded the upper creek . It was cooler here in the dappled sunlight and Rufel slowed her pace . Of course she knew they weretalking about two different people . Though how that crazy gal could think she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had half-hoped the same thing . Rufel knew the darky often shammed sleep but she had also sensed the girl 's puzzled wonder at her words , and her wide-opened eyes had seemed to invite confidences . Rufel had not talked of Charleston with the raw yearning that Mammy had come to hate and fear , but as simple proof that that life had existed ; the darky 's credulous , if drowsy , attention had seemed somehow to confirm that existence . Rufelp122flushed angrily . She had acted no better than the wench ; she had fallen into reminiscing with a strange darky . Mammy would say she was too trusting , Rufel knew , too openhearted . The wench had been sassy , but it was Rufel who had first forgotten her place , gossiping like common trash . She could hear Mammy 's voice plain as day . I was just trying to cheer her up , she thought defensively . Must be dull as straw laying up in that bed all day . If she had chatted a bit long , well , Rufel admitted that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes came near to crushing her . And to be invited to speak  --  Resentment flared in her . Anyway , she thought sullenly , there had been no call for the wench to turn so hateful . Making up all that stuff just to be mean . Rufel came out on the narrow shoreline and was almost upon the dark figure by the tree before she noticed him , or he her . One of the darkies who came to see the girl , recognized in the instant before she could scream . Fishing : the pole propped between his knees , his back propped against the tree trunk , battered hat over his face . Sensing or only hearing her , he moved . Hat slipping , pole falling , body struggling to rise , he seemed at first all arms and legs , a shapeless darkness contained by ragged clothes , topped by the light-colored hat , and she covered her mouth to laugh . Balanced now , he rose , fluid , looming black against the sky , stopping the laugh in her throat . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Softly , arm out , hand up , open , looking straight into her eyes . " I 'm just fishing . " He gestured with the pole toward the creek . " No trespass intended . " But he made no move to go . Confused she stopped . " Why  --  " It was her place , she thought indignantly . " You  --  " Everywhere ; they were everywhere , her house , her bed  --  And Mammy  --  Rufel burst into tears . Of course she knew Mammy 's name , she told herself , and she would think of it as soon as she got over being so upset . She " Mis'ess . " Close to her , body heat drawing her . . . " Miz  --  " She threw her arms around the shoulders , her head seeking that spot where the frayed collar lay open against the black neck.  | " Mammy , " she hiccuped against the soft , supple cloth , and , rememberingwith painful clarity : " Dorcas . It was Dorcas . " Dorcas . Pappa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rufel sometimes claimed . Dorcas was a lady 's maid extraordinairewho had traveled with her former mistress in France and , at eleven hundred dollars ( you could get a good field hand for that ! ) , far too expensive a present for a thirteen-year-old girl . Dorcas did for all three of the Carson ladies , sewing , laundry , hair , dressing them , choosing their clothes . They called her Mammy because Mrs. Carson thought the title made her seem as if she had been with the family for a long time . She cared for them all , restraining Mrs. Carson 's taste for low-cut dresses and Rowena 's penchant for gaudy furbelows . She kept five-year-old Benjamin junior in starched shirt fronts when company came and introduced the senior Carson men to the comforts of the soft tie , which had not then come into the general vogue . She made Rufel stand up straight , rinsed her babyfinehair in malt water and lemon , and arranged it becomingly about her childlishly thin face . And loved her . It was Rufel Mammy had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiled . " Dorcas , " spoken promptly in response to Rufel 's startled question at finding a strange slave in her room . Her face was like coffee with nothing of cream in it , Rufel had thought in confusion , feeling gangly and graceless , conscious of her rumpled pinaforeand the hair that straggled limply about her face . " Dorcas " was neat as a pin : Her long , narrow white apron was spotless , pinned under the bust rather than tied at the waist of her dark gown ; a white kerchief was arranged in precise folds over her broad bosom ; a cream-colored bandanna  --  No , Rufel corrected herself . The silky-looking cloth on the darky 's head bore little resemblance to the gaudy-colored swatches most darkies tied about their heads . This was a scarf , knotted in a rosette behind one ear . Rufel , used to the rather haphazard dress of the other house slaves , was made uncomfortable by the darky 's tidy appearance . Why , she thought , again in confusion , she 's almost stylish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your mamma , " the darky said pleasantly . She put away the last of Rufel 's undergarments in the chest , closed the drawer , and turned , for Rufel had remained silent . " You are Miss Ruf  --  ? " " Ruth . Ruth Elizabeth , " she said then , the spell broken . The darkies never could get her name straight , slurring and garbling the syllables until the name seemed almost unrecognizable . The careless pronunciation of the two household servants annoyed Mrs. Carson ; often she dealt offenders a sharp slap across the mouth . Automatically , sure of herself now , firm and clear , " Ruth Eliz-abeth . " " That 's quite a mouthful for a young beanpole like yourself . " And Ruth Elizabeth , drawing herself up in offended dignity  --  for she was agonizingly conscious of her height , her suddenly expandingbreasts , and tried to minimize both by slouching  --  was arrested by the smile flashing like a firefly across the dark face . The eyes lit with laughter , yet for a moment , Rufel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I ? Is it all right to tease ? Drawn by that firefly grin , yet disturbed by the darky 's obvious assurance , Rufel was relieved by that hint of uncertainty ; it made the darky seem more natural and herself a bit more comfortable . Rufel had been lonely , had felt herself ugly and awkward . Mammy talked with her , admired her hair and rather full-lipped smile , showed her how to walk erectly . She praised where Mrs. Carson had criticized , hugged where Rufel 's own mother had scolded . Whatever Rufel had not taken to that pillowy bosom seemed insignificant to her now ; and she had been taken to that cushiony bosom , been named there ' Fel , Rufel . To hear the names on Mammy 's lips was to hear , to know herself loved . The hands in her hair now were hard , the chest , the arms . Rufel sat up sniffing . A dark hand obligingly offered her a ruffled cloth . She blew her nose with dainty precision , only then realizing that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aghast , and caught her breath . Never had she seen such blackness . She blinked , expecting to see the bulbous lips and bulging eyes of a burnt-cork minstrel . Instead she looked into a pair of rather shad/owy eyes and strongly defined features that were  --  handsome ! she thought shocked , almost outraged . She looked again , surreptitiouslythis time , conscious of herself , the darky , a male , herself , on the ground , together . He had dropped his arm from her shoulderat her first start of surprise ; stiffly now , she drew further away from him . " Dorcas . " He cleared his throat . " Dorcas ; that was the lady that died ? " Rufel sniffed again and nodded . " She treated me just like , just like  --  " She stuttered and could have wept again , seeing with an almost palpable lucidity how absurd it was to think of herself as Mammy 's child , a darky 's child . And shuddered . A pickaninny . Like the ragged , big-bellied urchins she had seen now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting capers , beggingcoppers . Mammy was a slave , a nigger , and , and " She  --  She was my maid , " she finished lamely , confused ; " my personal servant . " But Mammy was my friend , she thought . Embarrassed by her own recoil from the cherished memory , she said stoutly , " She loved me . And no darky can tell me different ! " she added fiercely . She hiccuped and scooted closer to his comforting warmth . " That wench , " she continued angrily , " the one you-all always making over  --  " " Dessa ? " "  --  said Mammy did n't love me , could n't possibly have loved me . " " I do n't see that as much to take on about . " The darky spoke quietly . " Something some darky said . " " She  --  " " Dessa did n't even know Dorcas , and just met you . Why you so upset ? " Rufel opened her mouth to speak , closed it , and turned away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the familiarname , " remembering her . " Unable then to recall the familiarface , she blinked away angry tears , seeing then the loved features , the coffee-black skin and cream-colored head-scarf , the full lips , but subtly altered so the face seemed that of a stranger.  | " Guess you must have cared for Dorcas a lot . " She nodded and wiped her nose , warming to the quiet voice . " I talked to her every day of my life from the time I was thirteen . I do n't think I ever thought a thought during all that time that I did n't tell Mam  --  Dor  --  That I did n't tell her . Well , " seeing his skeptical look . Had he known Mammy ? she thought wildly , and looked away . " Not everything . When I was  --  After I got married , there was certain thoughts a married lady ca n't share . But I told her everything else , " she said hurriedly , grabbing among memoriesshe and Mammy had shared . " I 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Misses Greyson , Regina and Dolly  --  they were my particular friends . " There was no special day she remembered , just the feel of those strolls about the city with Pompey , one of the Greysons ' darkies , walking along behind , or the taste of the buttery little biscuits the Greysons ' cook made for afternoon tea . Mammy had not always been there when Rufel returned from an outing ; often as not , Mammy had been dressing Mrs. Carson or trying to comb the tangles out of Rowena 's thick , honey-blond curls . But always she found the time to review the happenings of Rufel 's day , to exclaimover any small triumph , to console , advise , coax , chide  --  Rufel had started to describe the dress she had worn to Abigail Sorenson 's ball when she became aware of movement at her side . The darky stood , hat in one hand , fish at his side in the other ; Rufel stood also , her face burning . She had done it again , she saw ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if darkies could ever know the life she spoke of . " Scuse ; scuse me , Mistress , for intruding . " The darky was bowingand backing away . " Scuse me . " He was gone . Rufel stamped her foot angrily . They were jealous of course , jealous of her memories , jealous that her life had been so much better than theirs , that it would be again . She was crying because she missed Mammy , she told herself as she sat under the tree and wept . Ada had made the darky a pallet on the floor in the bedroom ,  |p127she  reported when Rufel returned to the House . Rufel , her breasts throbbing , said nothing to this as she bent to pick up Clara . " I fed Little Missy a soft egg and some custard , " Ada said quickly . Rufel ignored this , too , as she fumbled to open her bodice . She could hear the baby crying through the closed bedroom door , but she shrank from the thought of nursing him , a pickaninny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would  --  see it . His dark skin might as well be fur . " When the baby sleep through the night , Dessa move back of stairs . " Ada spoke loudly . Just like the reason I do n't answer is cause I ca n't hear , Rufel thought irritably . Clara had done as much playing as nursing and now settled sleepily in the curve of Rufel 's arm . The tightness in one of her breasts had eased but the other continued to throb . " Where Dorcas used to sleep , " Ada continued . "  --  if that all right with you , " she added quickly . So you finally realized you have to ask the mistress round here , Rufel thought spitefully , enjoying Ada 's obvious discomfiture . Aloud , she said angrily , " I do n't care where that wench sleep . " She would have to feed the baby , Rufel thought wearily . She took the sleeping Clara into the bedroom and laid her in the crib . The darky was awake but Rufel avoided her eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background looking uneasily from one to the other . Mammy would have had the story out of us in a minute , she thought as she returned to the parlor , forced an apology from the instigator  --  if not from both !  --  as she used to do when Rufel and Rowena quarreled . Rufel caught herself up short . There you go again , she told herself angrily , expecting all darkies to be like Mammy . Like family , a voice wailed silently within her . Rufel sank gratefully into the rocker in the parlor and freed her breast to the baby 's searching mouth . The baby planted a tiny fist on her breast , sucking hungrily , his shoe-button eyes glittery with tears . She turned her head from his stare , uncomfortable underp128his unwinking gaze . Almost of their own volition , her fingers stroked his silken curls , so different from the bald heads of her own newborns , the utter brownness of him a striking contrast with the pallor of their skins . Willfully , she closed her eyes and , sighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding . Later , lying awake in the big bed , she welcomed the soft regularityof the girl 's breathing in the larger silence of the night . She hated the stillness , the quiet . Listening to the crickets , hearing Timmy turn in sleep , or Clara 's occasional sighs , was like listening to some extension of the hush , as if she were the only waking , thinking being in the vast emptiness she had not even been aware of when Mammy was alive . Ada had said the name so easily , had always called Mammy " Dorcas , " Rufel knew . Dorcas . She mouthed the name , seeing Mammy 's face now , but finding no comfort in the familiar image . It was as if the wench had taken her beloved Mammy and put a stranger in her place . Had Mammy had children , Rufel wondered , suckled a child at her breast as she did the wench 's , as she did with her own ? And how had Mammy borne it when they were taken away  --  That 's if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had only the wench 's word for that . And they were not , she repeated , talking about the same woman . But Mammy might have had children and it bothered Rufel that she did not know . Mammy had liked blackberries , Rufel knew . Every summer they had put up jam and Mammy had coaxed tarts from whatever darky was trying to cook . They had not had much luck with cooks , with the cook-stove , but Mammy could talk the roughest field hand through a creditable tart , Rufel thought with a smile . Mammy had liked to work with silk and had directed the work of the householdfrom a chair under the oak tree in the kitchen yard as long as fair weather held . Had she a sweetheart ? A child ? In all the years she 'd known her , Rufel had never seen Mammy without the rosette-knotted cloth on her head and the snowy kerchieftied across her bosom , until Mammy got too ill to rise from her pallet back of the stairs . So changed , the dark face framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , softer than a skeinp129of the silkiest wool . And yet the same , making light of her ailment , humoring Rufel , who had the darkies move the mattress from the cramped quarters under the stairwell into the parlor where Rufel nursed her . Both of them enjoyed the brief reversal  --  though Mammy only let Rufel do so much and no more  --  neither believing that Mammy could come to harm over such a little cold . Mammy was kind and wise and strong ; her short black hair curled about the fingers with a will of its own ; she had narrowfingeredhands , the thumb and second finger calloused from sewingbecause she hated wearing a thimble ; she liked blackberries and silk and the oak tree in the kitchen yard . That much and no more , Rufel thought , somehow shamed ; eleven years and only then to know the feel of a loved one 's hair under a loving hand . Truly , such ignorance was worse than grief . She thought feverishly . Mammy had not liked France . Oh , it was pretty enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carson had reported often to their friends , when she still talked about her new slave before company , before she learned , Rufel thought with new bitterness , that it was better to have an old servant named Mammy than to have a " French " maid who could n't talk French . Had Mammy minded when the family no longer called her name ? Was that why she changed mine ? Rufel thought fearfully . Was what she had alwaysthought loving and cute only revenge , a small reprisal for all they 'd taken from her ? How old had Mammy been ? Why had they gone to France ? Rufel had never asked . Had she any children ? The wench 's breathing seemed to fill the room . Slaves were free in France , Rufel thought ; it was like going north where the Yankeestried to entice slaves away . Had Mammy loved that other mistress so much ? Sudden , foolish jealousy spurted through her , about a woman you do n't even know , she berated herself . Mammy made the same choice for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those shiftless darkies . But Rufel knew , even as she told herself this , that escaping to the woods or even running away to the north was not the same as being free in France . And Mammy had passed that up to return . She would have returned if she had a child , Rufel knew , thinking of the wench 's words that after/noon . Mammy have children . What had the colored girl called her Mammy ? Rose . Dorcas . Rose  --  smooth black . She remembered the phrase , the fresh airish smell that seemed to follow Mammy  --  Dorcas . Rose ? Would the wench call that coffee-dark skin " smooth black " ? Rufel herself had seen Mammy 's eyes in the wench 's face . The wench was from Charleston . Mammy had returned to Charleston all those long years ago . Rufel was awakened sometime before dawn by the baby 's muffledcries . She lay still a moment , consciously struggling out of sleep , feeling puffy-eyed and heavy-lidded , breasts throbbing faintly . He had been crying , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and wondered why the stupid wench had n't brought him to her or at least called her . She bent to pick him up , her muttered complaints abruptly silenced by the memory of how reluctantly she had nursed him earlier in the evening . Wench still should have enough sense to know I would n't let him go hungry , she thought a trifle self-righteously ; yet , she was rather pleased to realize that she had some real power over the wench and Ada . The baby seemed to recognize her touch for he stopped crying and turned his face to nozzle at her bosom . He was such a tiny thing to have so big a voice , so fierce a will , she thought . A careless hug could kill him , yet he demanded care and trusted that someone would provide it . Shaken by a sudden wave of protectiveness and remorse , she climbed back in bed and bared her breast to his searching . She had used the baby 's hunger to spite the wench and was shamed by the knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wench , too , but she could not bring herself to do so , Ada could act so funny , even when asked the most harmless question  --  as thoughanybody but Rufel would already know the answer . And in thiscase , Rufel would almost agree with her . She , Rufel , had been Mammy 's friend and she was chagrined by her own ignorance . She would send for Ada after dinner , Rufel temporized , or go outto the kitchen herself after supper . She whiled away the day , angryat her own past thoughtlessness , unwilling to expose her presentuncertainty to Ada 's view.  |p131Harker  came to visit the girl after supper . On impulse , Rufel followed him outside when he left , calling to him as he crossed the yard . Harker had known Mammy and had brought the girl here . She hurried down the back steps , determined to have her questions answered . He waited for her at the edge of the yard , hat lifted slightly above his bushy head , pleasant-faced as always , yet conveying a certain guardedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . Thus the question she asked now was not about Mammy as she had meant , but about the wench and more challenging than she intended . " That wench from Charles-ton ? " He hesitated , then admitted rather sheepishly , " No 'm . You know some of them places so little , only people know of em is the ones that live there  --  and it 's not many of them . " A grin moved slowly and easily across his face . " We just said Charleston cause we thought you being from that area you might know something of the hardship she had to bear . " So it was to play on my sympathy , she thought triumphantly ; then blurted , " Did Mam  --  Dorcas have any children ? " " Why  --  She never spoke of none that I know of . " And then , with dawning comprehension , " You do n't think Dessa related to Dorcas , do you ? " She did n't think so , but that question had been there in her mind nonetheless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , is she ? " Almost she expected him to laugh ; the question was so ridiculous . He looked at her quizzically . " I would n't think so , " he said slowly . " But I do n't know so , either . Nathan might ; and he 'd be the one to ask . " " Nathan ? " " Tall , dark-skinned fellow  --  " She remembered the darky at the creek . Dark-skinned ; so that was what they called it , picturing the dusky skin that had seemed like jet to her . " You want I tell him come see you ? " The darky 's question startled her . " No . No . " She felt slightlyp132panicky at the thought of questioning the darky with Ada in , the parlor or the wench across the hall . " No ; it 's not important , " she said quickly . " Thank you , Harker , " she said turning away . The darky was probably at the creek , fishing again when he ought to be working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After dinner the next day , Rufel made sure that both babies were asleep then went to look for the darky . The best fishing on the whole property was at the pool some distance downstream from the spot where she had seen the darky the day before . Bertie had given her that spot as her own ; he allowed the darkies the use of some streams west of the fields but he had forbidden them the watering places close to the House . The darkies had generally abided by the rule as far as the spot on the upper creek was concernedbut the fishing at the pool had drawn them like flies to honey . It had been one of the most frequent causes of punishment . There was no one at the pool that afternoon , nor at the spot upstream , and she had turned to go when the darky seemed to emerge from the trees . " You sent at me , Mis'ess ? " " No , " she said startled . Face to face with him , she was not at all sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly sent . " He paused as though waiting for her to speak , but Rufel could think of nothing to say . He continued , " Harker said you was asking about Dessa . " He paused . She scrambled about in her mind for something to say , but found nothing . " He thought maybe there was something you might want to ask me about her . " He did not say he would answer , she noticed , just as he had made no excuse or move to go when she surprised him loafing yesterday . It was as if they did n't know how they should act in front of a white person , she thought , amazed and uneasy . She had never met darkies who seemed so unversed in what was due her place as these . Harker , Ada , Annabelle , none of them offered her anything that she had not specifically requested ; they volunteered no act that she had not specifically directed ; they never sought top133oblige her . Mammy had attributed this to Annabelle 's slowness and refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rufel thought , often bordered on the presumptuous . Harker had never displayed any suggestion of Ada 's cheekiness but she knew he volunteered his knowledge of the land and how to work it out of something other than loyalty or duty to her . She felt , too , in him a certain reserve ; he would give this much and no more . He could just as easily have told me about that wench , she thought crossly now . Certainly he must know more about Mammy . Instead he had put her off on this stranger who was no more obliging than he . She eyed the darky with disfavor . " He said "  --  the darky spoke as though in response to her look  --  " he said you was asking about Dessa and Dorcas . " She nodded , hoping her continued silence would force him into further speech . " Dessa was n't no ways related to Dorcas , " he continued after a moment . " Not that I knows of , anyway . Dessa come from a plantation up around Monks Corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of em from up around that way . " " You-all said she was from Charleston . " She still felt a sense ofsatisfaction in having at least exposed that fabrication . He shrugged . " Charleston , Augusta ; do n't matter all that much . Ai n't likely she 'd know anyone you know . She  --  " " You-all lied . " " Yes , Mis'ess , " he admitted without a trace of guilt , " and we did n't mean you no harm . Dessa been through a hard time and if stretching the truth a little get her a spot of rest  --  " He shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands palm up . As though that explained it all , she thought indignantly . She turned away fuming . " Wait , " he said touching her arm suddenly , lightly ; and withdrew his hand as quickly . He rubbed it slowly along his pant leg , looking at a point just over her shoulder . " I seen her when she come out that sweatbox they put her in . Know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box they put willful darkies in , built so 's you ca n't lie down in it or sit or stand in it . It do got ap134few holes in it so you can breathe , but plenty people done suffocatedin em . They whipped her , put her in that , let her sweat out in the sun . " " That wench do n't have a scar on her back , " she said quickly . He looked briefly in her face , and she turned away , uneasy at the boldness of that glance . " They lashed her about the hips and legs , branded her along the insides of her thighs . " Rufel shivered ; that could n't be true , it was too , too awful , she thought ; and how did this darky know anyway ? " How do you know ? " she challenged ; yet , she was interested despite herself . " How you come to see all this ? " He did not look at her this time , rather he looked toward her . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying up around Minifree when he heard about an experienced field hand , already breeding , for sale at Simeon . Master Wilson ride a pretty mile out his way to look at a proposition like that and he taken me with him . So I was there . I seen her when she come out the box . " They 'd just about whipped that dress off her and what had n't been cut off her  --  dress , drawers , shift was hanging round her in tatters or else stuck in them wounds . Just from the waist down , you see , cause they did n't wan na impair her value . ' That 's what her mistress told Wilson . She drove a hard bargain ; I was there and I heard that , too . " His face had a stubborn cast to it , as though he expected her to challenge this . " Mistress told Wilson out front that the girl was scarred and she still got four hundred dollars for her . " He shook his head and chuckled ruefully . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " I do n't know how long they had her in that box . Her face was swolled ; she was bloody and dirty , cramped from laying up in there . I did n't think she could stand up ; but she did . " He spoke with quiet intensity . " She stood up . " Rufel could see the scene as he described it . The darky himself tying the wench 's hands , looping the lead rope over the pommel of his saddle , walking the horse across the yard and around to the front of the house as she stumbled along behind , seeing the darIdeslining the drive , some , as he said , hiding their faces , othersp135staring straight ahead . Had her own people been there , Rufel wondered , her own Rose ? She could almost feel the fire that must have lived in the wench 's thighs . " The mistress was standing on the front porch , talking to Wilson . He was already mounted up and when he saw me , he started off at a trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that girl could n't bit more run than I could fly and I did n't want to drag her . Well , Master Wilson , he rode back and hit my horse , piya ! like that cross the rump . By the time I got the horse under control , Dessa 'd been drug about the yard a good bit . And Wilson was right there beside me , his hand on my hand when I moved to help her up . No , ' he told me . That her first lesson on this coffle . She got to keep up . ' " She was crying , you know , tears making mud on her face , dirt from head to toe so she looked like something bandoned longside the road . She picked her own self up and I know her skin must 've been screaming . But she did n't ask that white man for no mercy ; not then , not ever that I knows of . " " What a horrid story , " Rufel breathed after a moment , imaginingthe agony of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious trader . " The darky shrugged again . " Master Wilson was n't like some , cruel just cause he could be ; he did n't believe in damaging goods , though if he could get em cheap enough , he bought em . That what he done then was mostly for show , impress the mistress with how slaves ought to be handled . Soon as we was out of sight , he let me take her up on the horse with me ; she rode in the supply wagontill she healed enough to walk . He was n't trying to kill her . " " I know , " Rufel said softly . Which made it all the more horrible . To violate a body so . That 's if it happened , she told herself . She had sat , at some point during the darky 's recital , on a low stump ; the darky sat on his haunches a few feet from her . Rufel rose now , conscious that they had talked a long time , brushing carefully at her dress , yet reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " she asked curiously . He hesitated , then said tersely , " Escaped off the coffle. "  |p136Rufel  looked at him in some disbelief . She had seen coffles ; they were a common enough sight on the riverboats , the men loaded with chains , the women with scarcely enough rags to cover them decently , all of them dirty and desolate . She found it hard to reconcilethat memory with the presence of this darky . They seemed to personify wretchedness ; he glowed with life . For that matter , the wench looked remarkably healthy to have been through all the darky said . She looked at him sternly . " She must have done somethingpretty bad , " she said , unable herself to imagine such a crime . " I do n't know about that . " The darky rose also . " Some owners , it do n't take much . Maybe Dessa 's was one like that . Whatevershe done , it was n't enough to impair her value . ' " The gently gibing tone seemed to mock her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the master ; that 's why the mistress was so cruel . I bet that 's what it was . " " Dessa was breeding when Wilson bought her , Mis'ess , " he said . " What she was carrying laying right up there in your house now . No white man ai n't had no hand in that . " " Well , " thinking of the nut-brown face , but " His hair , " rememberingits silken texture . " You not going to tell me darkies have hair like that , " she said stubbornly . " Mis'ess "  --  he was shaking his head and laughing softly  --  " every negro baby I ever seen come in the world got curls shine like satin ... and nap up "  --  he snapped his fingers  --  " inside six months . You see that boy in a year , he wo n't even be able to get a curry comb through that crop . " " Truly ? " smiling at the idea . He nodded mock-solemn ; startled by his drollery , she laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she had intended , " Are you the baby 's father ? " No , Mis'ess , " he said steadily . " I think you-all are sweethearts . " She smiled at him encouragingly , thinking that would explain his evident protectiveness of the girl . He shook his head . " Dessa ai n't been in too much of a position to think about no sweetheart , " he said without looking at her.  | " Well , " she began , moved in spite of herself by the simple statement ; she faltered . Still , something inside her urged , you did n't just up and whip a slave , without some reason . " Well , I know it must 've been something happen to cause all that . " " Whatever it was , she paid for it . Man gone , mammy gone . Dorcas , now , " he said abruptly , turning toward her again , " her I ca n't tell you too much about . She talked mostly about you , things yo 'll had done . She set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from just general conversation , you was what she talked about . " He shrugged . " Ada say she believe Dorcas was from Virginia , " he continued . " Near as we can figure  --  cause you know Dorcas did n't just sit down and tell no one her life story  --  was maybe she had a couple of kids . But they was sold away or maybe she just lost touch with them early on . The peoples she belonged to seemed to have moved round quite a bit , least ways she seemed to know something about a lot of different places . White people do n't hardly travel with no pickaninnies , so , much as she moved round , it 's doubtful Dorcas even know her own children , if she had any . " That was worse , Rufel thought , blinking back a quick rush of tears . " Mis'ess ? " She looked up . " I would n't take what Dessa say much to heart . She been through a hard time . You know you been through a hard time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was what her own common sense told her but she was outragedto hear herself compared to the wench . " I knew that little hellion could n't be no kin to Mammy , " she said tartly . " The mistress have to see the welts in the darky 's hide , eh ? " " Ye  --  " His tone implied that her desire for proof was mean and petty and she flushed hotly , as the image of herself inspectingthe wench 's naked loins flashed vividly to life in her mind . " Well  --  " How else was she to know the truth of what they said ? " I know it 's more to this than you telling , " she flung at him as she turned to go . " And I 'm going to get to the bottom of it . " Rufel hurried toward the house in some agitation , yet she was relieved that the wench was n't related to Mammy  --  though after hearing that horror story she could well understand the wench'sp138confusion , her hysterical insistence on her mammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her do n't mean that Mammy did n't love me , Rufel thought , wanting desperately to believe that Mammy had loved her not only fully , but freely as well . Almost she felt personally responsible for Mammy 's pain , personally connected to it , not as the soother of hurt as Mammy had always been for her , but as the source of that pain . She , Rufel , who would never have knowingly hurt a hair on Mammy 's head . It was not so , of course . Rufel 's footsteps slowed as she neared the House . If anything , she had been the center of Mammy 's world  --  And the children , Mammy'schildren  --  girls or boys ? Had Mammy been taken from them ? How did they bare such pain ? she wondered , thinking then of a branding iron searing tender flesh . Surely whipping was enough ; there was nothing she had ever heard like the scream of a darky under the lash . Had Bertie stopped the beatings as he 'd said or merely moved them , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mammy  --  Had anyone ever whipped her ? Rufel wondered , surprised at how angry the thought made her . Why , the very quality of her relationship with Mammy might have been grounds for a beating with some masters , she realized with alarm , remembering Mammy 's tart answers , her way of forgetting to do what she did n't want to do when she felt such forgetfulness was in Rufel 's best interests . It did n't take much : remembering the darky 's words . Often it had taken no more with Bertie than a broken plowshare ( which cost money ) or a darky who did n't move fast enough . That was only at first , Rufel protested to herself ; Bertie had become a good master . Why , she could n't remember the last time a darky had been whipped at the Glen ; certainly she would have heard the screams ( unless Bertie had taken to whipping them in the woods ) or Mammy would have told her  --  Would n't she ? Rufel recalled Mammy 's tight-lipped face the first time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and pained expression had seemed to demand that she , Miz Tel , do something . And she had , had n't she ? Coaxed and pleaded with Bertie , though it had seemed to do little good at first . But the screams had stopped ,  |p139she  repeated to herself . This , with this wench , was unusual . And they had branded her , too . That 's if she took the darky 's word for it , branded her and sold her away . She must have done something pretty terrible . Rufel clung to this belief , although it gave her little comfort . The wench was dozing on the pallet when Rufel returned to the House , the baby snuggled carefully in the crook of her arm , and Rufel stood a moment in the doorway watching them . They were as peaceful as a painting , the girl a vivid chocolate and jet against the whiteness of the sheets , the baby as bright as toast against the bedding and the darky 's arm . The darky 's tale of beatings and brandings seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gullible and trade on the goodwill of the openhearted . Rufel stalked across the floor and knelt by the pallet . The wench awakened almost immediately , her eyes gleaming forth from the darkness of her face , quickly hidden as she ducked her head under Rufel 's gaze . " What 's your name , gal ? " Rufel asked sharply . " Dessa . Dessa Rose , ma'am , " she said in a raspy voice . Rufel was slightly taken aback ; she had not expected the wench to answer so readily . " Why 'd you run away ? " The darky kept her eyes downcast and plucked nervously at the coverlet . " Cause , cause I did n't want my baby to be slaved , " she said finally in a rush and still without looking at Rufel . Rufel looked at the baby , seeing in him the pickaninnies at Mobile . And that 's what he 'll look like , too , if I put you all out of here , she thought pettishly . " I mean , why your mistress use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wench said on a long shuddering breath as she turned her face away . Rufel was stunned for a moment by the ring of utter truth in the statement , yet , almost of its own volition , her hand reached to draw back the covers from the darky 's body . She drew back at Rufel 's touch , her eyes popping open in alarm . Rufel blushed , thinking for the first time of how humiliating she would find such an inspection . " Are you  --  are you healing properly ? " " Yes . Yes 'm . " Why , Rufel thought , this wench actually afraid of me . Con/scious for the first time that she herself could be in physical dangerfrom these strange darkies , she realized that she had fallen into the habit of thinking of the runaways as a slightly malicious means of evening the score in their continuing estrangement in the neighborhood . Somebody somewhere was using the Sutton slaves ; why should n't she use these  --  especially since she had neither enticed them away from wherever they came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada with the stock cuts used to illustratenewspaper advertisements of slave sales and runaways : pants rolled up to the knees , bareheaded , a bundle attached to a stick slung over one shoulder , the round white eyes in the inky face giving a slightly comic air to the whole . She still thought Ada and the others no more than casual truants , avoiding work or even punishments . But this wench and that big darky  --  especially him , she thought , remembering his size and self-possession -- even that yellow boy who came to see the wench , were all , no doubt , hardenedrogues . Had to be , to get clean away from a coffle as they apparently had done . Yet this wench was afraid of her . Rufel sat back on her heels , fighting a panicky urge to laugh . Like I was the criminal ; her mouth quirked involuntarily . Calmed by the wench 's fear , she rose and left the room . The wench began to sit up , to take notice of her surroundings , though she said little to Rufel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes downcast . The darky 's diffidence irked Rufel and she was offended by the way the girl flinched from her when she reached for the baby , by the girl 's surreptitious examination of the child when Rufel returned him after nursing . For all the world like she was going to find some fingers or toes missing , Rufel thought indignantly . Exasperated , she told the wench , " Just becauseone mistress misused you do n't mean all of us will . " She did stop flinching at Rufel 's approach , but it was plain to Rufel that the wench did not like having to let her nurse the baby ; and she seemed incapable of even casual conversation with Rufel . Some/times Rufel wanted to laugh  --  she had thought that " devil woman " business no more than a joke . At other times , remembering the silly , passionate argument over Mammy , she knew the wench 's reticence and timidity were feigned , and was angry and bewilderedby the deception . The wench talked freely enough with Ada and the other darkies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their conversationas she sat in the parlor ; now and then she heard a soft chuckle or muffled giggle and was surprised at how envious the laughter made her feel . She watched the wench covertly when she was in the bedroom , wondering what she could have done to make the other darkies , even laughingly , call her " devil woman . " There had been only admiration in the big darky 's tone when he spoke of her , no hint of fear or amusement in his voice . Though it would probably take more than this little pesky gal to frighten that darky , Rufel thought , recalling the breadth of his shoulders and the hard muscled arms . Rufel sensed somewhere in the general outline of the wench 's tale a deeper story and one not entirely unrelated to her concern for Mammy , though she could not say just how . She blamed the curious restlessness she felt on her unanswered questionsabout the wench and one afternoon she gave in to impulse and wandered out to the stream . Rufel and the darky were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood and touched his hat . " Evening . " He bowed his head slightly . She stood awkwardly , shifting her weight from one foot to another . " Fishing ? " she asked . He nodded , then as though remembering himself , " Yes 'm , " and touched his hat again . " Nice spot for it . " He shrugged . " Not as good as the spot down by the pool , but quieter . Everyone trying to fish down there this evening , " he explained . It seemed somehow rude to tell him that darkies were not allowed to use either , so Rufel merely nodded . She saw the stump she had sat on the other day and sat again , tucking her skirtsp142carefully about her . After a moment he picked up the pole he had laid aside , cast , and sat on the ground a short distance from her . They were silent . She cleared her throat . " Why you-all call that wench  --  " " Dessa ? " he asked quietly . " Yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where you hear that ? " he asked sharply . She shrugged , pleased to have finally gotten a rise out of him . " Oh , I hear things , " she said airily . " It have something to do with you-all escaping from that coffle , huh ? " He grinned slightly . " That ai n't nothing but something white folks made up , " he said with an air of unconcern . " Well , why they call her that ? " she prodded . " That 's some mess  --  That 's some of Harker 's talk , " he said annoyed . " Dessa done her part just like everybody else , just she was more easy to pick out cause of that big belly . " He chuckled suddenly . " She did like to scare Master Wilson half to death when she jumped on his back  --  he screeched like a stuck pig and she was already yelling like a banshee . I guess white folks might of thought they was in hell . " " You-all did kill some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , finally , that this question had been in the back of her mind ever since he told her of the escape from the coffle . " Mis'ess , " he said looking at her steadily , " we ai n't harmed no one did n't offer us harm first . " " You-all going to kill me ? " " No , Mis'ess . " He sounded genuinely shocked . " Do n't suppose you 'd tell me if you was , " she said , still on a note of disbelief . " Mis'ess , " he said earnestly , " ai n't no one here plan you no hurt or would do you or yours any harm . " He cleared his throat . " We all know it 's not too many white folks would let us stay round like this . " It was not exactly the expression of gratitude she felt the runawaysowed her , but , somewhat mollified and reassured , too , she asked curiously , " Was it a big battle ? "  | " On that coffle ? Not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rufel was disappointed . " Did that wench  --  Odessa really jump on that trader like you said ? " " Rode him like you would a mule , " he said , laughing outright . " Master Wilson a big burly man but she stuck to him like a burr to a saddle . Knocking him all upside the head with her bare hand , yelling to the rest of us , Get him , get him . ' Oh , she was something , " he said shaking his head . " All you darkies from off that coffle ? " she asked . " No 'm ; I believe Ned from down round Lowdnes County ; Red from round about Dallas County someplace . " Rufel had only a hazy idea of whom he spoke and an even hazieridea of where the counties he named were located . To cover her ignorance , she said sarcastically , " All you-all escaping from a cruel master , huh ? Beat every one of you worse than what that wench 's mistress beat her , huh ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old master died and the ' state was being broke up ; stead of being sold away from everything he knowed , he runned off . " He paused and looked at her in a measuring way . " Master Wilson cuff me sometime , throw a boot at me now then , but , sometime  --  sometime I get to wondering why Master can take his ease while I be the one that sweat , why the harder I work the more he gets . But I guess you would n't know nothing about that ? " he added , cutting his eyes at her . His lightly mocking tone recalled her earlier anguish over Mammy  --  Had she felt this way ? Rufel rose hastily to her feet . How could you love someone who used you so ? " Ada say you come from pretty big people back there in Charleston . " Rufel paused . He was watching her , she saw , not in that disconcertinglybold way he had , but from beneath properly lowered lashes . She was instantly suspicious ; he was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that big , " she said cautiously , remembering that other occasion , yet , wanting to impress him , she added quickly , " Oh , we was accepted by society , but we was n't real prominent . "  |p144The  darky nodded wisely . " Ada say Dorcas was always talking about the parties and dances you was invited to . " " Well , " she said slowly , " I did go to a lot of balls and parties , " and remembered with familiar yearning the ballroom glittering with the flames of a hundred candles ; the jewellike colors of the women'sdresses swirled in a kaleidoscope before her eyes . " Reckon he 'll be home right soon . " The darky 's voice recalled Rufel to his presence and she stared blankly at him . " What ? " " Your husband , " he prompted . " Reckon he 'll be home soon ? " " Yes , " she said nervously . " Yes , I expects him home any day now . " " Must be some powerful big business keep him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , any river , that would earnhim money , that would make him stay away from home like this ? "  --  gambling . " It was not the first time Rufel had asked herself this question and for a moment she thought she had spoken aloud , that the one word she 'd heard from the darky was his answer . She stared at him in disbelief . He grinned at her . " Oh , yes , ma'am , Harker 's old master was a gambler ; won Harker in a card game . Master 's cardplaying was how Harker got free . " Rufel relaxed as soon as she realized the darky was n't talking about Bertie ; the darky continued unperturbed . " Harker ai n't had to escape like the rest of us , least ways to hear him tell it . Seem like his master got caught with too many aces  --  you know it 's only four in a deck , Mis'ess , and there was three on the table and two in his hand . Not that I think the masterhere would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slyly , or so it seemed to her , out of the corner of his eye , then continuing casually , " Seem like Harker 's master was a regular cutup , a confidenceman you know . Sold snake-bite oil and a magic elixir was straight puredee alcohol . Sold well , too  --  especially to spinster ladiesand widders . " He paused for breath and Rufel grinned broadly at his fast/talking commentary . " You , " she said clapping her hands , " you are the funniest darky  --  " " Nathan , " he said smiling . " My name Nathan , Mis'ess . " Rufel hardly noticed . " What , " she asked laughingly , " what puredee alcohol ' and widders ' got to do with Harker escaping ? " Not much , as it turned out . Harker had not thought it prudent to stay around and find out what the other cardplayers thought of a five-ace deck , as he himself had several stashed about his person . These he had slipped to his master as occasion and circumstancepermitted while he served the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had previously arranged , Harker , believing all to be lost , had fled the vicinity . He had been a wanderer ever since . " Until he happened onto the Glen and a kind white lady named Miz  --  " He paused expectantly . Amused by his mock gallantry , she replied , " Rufel , " automatically , and wanted to bite her tongue . He tipped his hat slightly and continued , "  --  named Mistress ' Fel took him in . " Gratified that he showed no reaction to her use of a pet name and oddly moved by his use of the diminutive , she smiled . " That 's better , " he said . " Nice Miz Lady like you not supposed to go round all sad , " he said gruffly . " Why , why , " startled she stammered . " Thank you , Nathan , " she said touched . Now that she knew who Nathan was , Rufel seemed to see him frequently . He came every couple of days to see the girl and now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the yard for a moment as he finished some amusing pleasantry or anecdote , before turning back to the House . Often they met at the stream . It had been her habit to sit by the stream in summer with her sketch pad . She had some skill , she thought , with caricature , but Bertie had not encouraged this . The form , she knew , was rather vulgar but she could not help preferring the whimsical figures drawn as much from her imagination as life to the crude still-lifes and landscapes that Bertie praised as ladylike . So she hadp146seldom sketched ; she had watched the play of sunlight on the surface of the stream , counted the various shades of green among the branches of the overhanging trees , dozed a little , dreamed , though she could not remember of what . Sometimes now she took Clara , as she had once taken Timmy , and spread a quilt for her under the trees . Now and then Timmy and Dante , pausing between the vague but exciting adventures that drew them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking the fruit that Ada had started to can and dry for winter use , would sit with her . Most frequently it was Nathan who bore her company . He took his turn at the plow , he assured her when Rufel laughingly taxed him ( " Harker going see to that , " he added with a laugh ) , but his luck with snare and fishing pole were valued more than any furrow he could plow . He had shown Timmy and Dante how to make snares to trap the small game that abounded in the woods . The two youngsters had yet to make a contribution to the pot , but Nathan 's skill kept a variety of fresh meat on the table . And he told fascinating stories animals that talked , trees that had spirits , people who refused to die , and tales that he swore were " true to life . " Often Harker figured in these ; between them , the two of them seemed to have done everything possible for a darky to do and much that Rufel knew to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth that gave his grin an open , carefree quality , and little red-rimmed eyes that he could make dance or sparkle almost , it seemed , at will . His company came , in large measure , to replace the companionship Rufel had shared with Mammy . She could not see him as she had seen Mammy , almost as an extension of herself  --  his observations were , by and large , too racy for that . His opinions and positions were sometimes mildly outrageous  --  he would rather come back to life as an animal or bird with a chance to work his way back to humanform than sit around heaven drinking honey ; women were as smart as men ; there were some people who could see into the future but he could make even the driest crop report sound scandalously funny . He treated her with a semblance of the deferenceand indulgence that had characterized Mammy 's attitudep147toward her . Now and then , she might speak of some incident she had seen or heard of in Charleston or Mobile , but she felt little need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . Through talking with Nathan , Rufel came to know something of the people who lived in her Quarters : Ned , a young rascal given to playing pranks ; Red , who longed after a " wife " down around his homeplace ; Castor and Janet and the others  --  and once again became aware of the daily routine of the farm . She used him much as she had Mammy , as the means through which she participated in the life beyond the yard . These were not Sutton darkies , of course , so she was mindful of what she said . Nathan could shut his face just as tight and quick as Ada or that wench , but he was far friendlier . Rufel still felt some resentment that the wench had destroyed her comfortable , and comforting , image of Mammy , but she no longer held that silly argument against the wench . However hatefuland spiteful the wench had been , she could n't change the way Mammy had cared for Rufel . Even if Mammy herself had been spiteful , bitter , secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Rufel hers , had laid claim to her affections . Rufel knew this as love . She would have said as much , but the wench 's stiff civility made her hesitant to reopen the subject . She had heard the story of the escape from the coffle and the wench 's rescue from the cellar again and again from Nathan . She knew there must be some element of exaggeration as in his other " true-to-life " tales . She would not admire the action  --  one could n't , of course , approve any slave 's running away or an attack upon a master  --  still , something in her wanted to applaud the girl 's will , the spunk that had made action possible . The wench was nothing but a little old colored gal , yet she had helped to make herself free . Nothing Rufel said or did made either the wench or Ada more at ease with her . Once Rufel had entered the bedroom to find Ada combing the wench 's hair . The older darky sat in a ladder-back chair ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rungs of the chair . Her head rested on Ada 's knee as Ada 's fingers wove rhythmically through the stubby strands of the girl 's hair . Theyp148looked so companionable and content that Rufel almost felt an intruder . The moment the darkies became aware of her they started nervously , the wench vailing her eyes and bowing her head , Ada rising clumsily . Almost , Rufel begged pardon for entering her own room . When Nathan told her that the wench was trying to settle on a name for the baby , Rufel did not immediately suggest one . She called him Button , a name that Timmy and Ada had picked up from her , which seemed like a perfectly serviceable one to her . Almost , she offered it in jest , but it was obvious that Nathan took the matter seriously . He was all for naming the baby Kaine , after the baby 's daddy , and Harker agreed with him . The wench wanted to name the baby in honor of her rescuers . The baby 's daddy , like that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rake it up each time she called her son 's name . Rufel saw both sides and suggested , half humorously , that the baby be named for all of them , or at least a name that represented them all , and , on impulse , offered " Desmond " as a pretty compromise . " Des " for Odessa , " mond " to represent the men , Nathan , Cully , and Harker , who were responsiblefor his free birth . Button became Desmond Kaine ( called Mony because Odessa , so Nathan told her , felt him to be as good as gold ) with little ceremonythat Rufel could see . She said nothing , but felt that , as mistress of the place , she ought at least to have been advised . She added it to her secret count against the wench , which already includedher coldness toward herself and the wench 's growing chumminess with Ada . Now she took a private pleasure in having had some hand in naming Button , feeling repaid in some measure for the wench 's continuing aloofness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed Ruth Elizabeth 's name , that somehow she had snuck a little piece of the child for herself , had marked at least some part of him with something of her own making . She sought Nathan 's company more often  --  he at least treated her like a person  --  and took out her pique at the wench by teasing Nathan , insisting that he must be sweet on her . " You talk aboutp149her all the time , " she would say innocently , as if she herself took no delight in hearing of the girl 's exploits . At first Nathan had ignored her teasing remarks , then laughinglydenied them . One day , he burst out in genuine annoyance . " Course I 'm sweet on Dessa . Cully have a crush on her and I 'm sweet on him , ' too . " He laughed harshly . " You been through with someone what we been through together and you be sweet ' on em , too , " he said turning away from her . Rufel realized with dismay that he was really upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know I 'm only teasing . " After a moment , he turned back to her . " You see so many peoplebeat up by slavery , Mis'ess , " he said wearily , " turned into snakes and animals , poor excuses even for they own selfs . And the coffle bring out the worst sometime , either that or kill you . And it did n't in Dessa . " He sighed . " I feels bad for all them that did n't make it , worse for all them that did n't die , that even now living in slavery after we been free . But us three  --  we did it and we made it . It 's gots to be some special feeling after that . " " What going to happen when the master come back here ? " It was high summer , the weather hot , sultry . Rufel and Nathan had sat in companionable silence , sweating , speaking lazily , now and then , of one thing or another . This question made Rufel 's stomach lurch . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertie in weeks and even now his name did not awaken the familiarterror over his whereabouts . Rather , she was uneasy that Nathan should ask about him . " He going to give us a share of the crop like you did ? " Nathan asked almost idly . Share the crop . The words echoed in Rufel 's mind . That might mean something this year . Harker said they were likely to make thirty bales of cotton and close to a hundred bushels of corn in addition to the oats and potatoes . Cotton was the only cash cropp150but it was ridiculous to suppose that Bertie was likely to share any part of the harvest . " Or he going to try to claim us as his ? " Nathan continued quietly . Rufel looked at Nathan , unable to answer truthfully . He might , she knew ; Bertie might do anything . Her stomach tightened at the thought . He would want to enslave them . He did n't believe in sassy negroes or smart negroes or free negroes ; that was why he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hard and stinted on their food and clothing . Rufel knew this without ever having really seen it . Mammy had made sure that any darky who worked in or near the House was clean ; Bertie had not encouraged Rufel to roam much beyond the House and yard . She had seen the hands from a distance when she rode out to the fields with Bertie now and then . They did look wretched , he had admitted , but then slavery was a wretched lot . And she had accepted this as long as she did n't hear the screams . Rufel bit her lip . Could she be that blind again ? And these people would not be beaten or sold . She licked her lips . " I  --  I would n't let him sell you-all . " He looked at her with a humorous lift to his mouth and Rufel flushed . She would have no more rights than they when Bertie came back . " We do n't have to be here when he come back , " he said , leaningtoward her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if you help us . " Uneasy but intrigued despite herself , Rufel listened as Nathancontinued earnestly , " Member I told you his old master was a flimflam man , a confidence man ? Well , they had one scheme they used when they was down on they luck . They would go into a strange town and his master 'd sell Harker , auction him off . After a couple of days Harker would run off and join him at a place they 'd already picked out . They do that in a couple of towns till they got a stake together again . Harker figure we could go down in the black belt and run that scheme three or four times using me and him , maybe two or three others , we could make maybe nine or ten thousand dollars . And we 'd split it , split the money . That'dp151be five thousand cash dollars for you ; five thousand dollars for us to get away from here on . " Rufel was a little repelled by the scheme , yet amused , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she do the very thing she wanted to keep Bertie from doing . " What would I do with so much money ? " she asked skeptically . " What could n't you do ? " he asked with a hoot of laughter . " You say your husband went off looking for a new stake ; well , you 'd have one waiting for him right here when he come back . " When he came back . Bertie would take the money . They would resume their trips to Mobile and perhaps beyond ; they might finishthe second story . He would buy more slaves , clear more land , plant more cotton and their life would begin again : the poorly timed extravagances , the arguments with the neighbors , the wild schemes and dashed expectations , the single-minded dependence on cotton . Nobody around here planted more than a few acres of cotton ; Harker said the soil was too thin and sandy to nourish the hungry cotton plants . Rufel shook herself . Bertie had made a good home for them , she told herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What if he do n't come back ? What you going do then ? " The question opened the door on the bottomless terror that , in the settled heat of summer , she had thought gone forever and she teetered at the edge of panic . " Dorcas always thought you 'd go back to Charleston . " His quiet statement pulled her back from the brink and sheturned to him . Charleston . To go back without begging her family'sassistance , without risking their rebuffProfoundly disturbed and unwilling to continue the discussion , she changed the subject nervously . " What , what did you do when you was slaved ? " Aside from his true-to-life adventures , he never talked in any detail about his life and she had long felt a curiosity about him . " What did you do ? " she repeated . He was quiet so long that she thought she had offended him and he would not answer.  | " Worked for a slave trader grew negroes by planting they toes in the ground . Made em drink ink at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him restored to good humor , but unwilling to let him turn aside her question with a joke as he often did . " What 'd you really do ? " " Loved pretty white womens like you . " Her head snapped around ; he was grinning , the gap between his front teeth sparkling , the sherry-colored eyes dancing . The lie was so outrageous that she laughed . " No , seriously , " she said , sobering a little , but still gasping for breath . " Serious business . " He watched her steadily , only the twinkle and the grin lurking about his lips belying his outward gravity . " It 's a special kind of white woman ca n't keep they hands off a negro . Special breed of nigga wo n't let em . " She had n't laughed like this , she thought , hearing his soft chuckleunder her own , since , since she did n't know when . " All right , " she said suddenly , " what did you all do with the babies ? " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , " he said grandly , " not babies . " He shrugged . " Other peoples makes carriages and clothes . White mens makes labor and "  --  he cut his eyes at her  --  " lust . Why ca n't I make love to a "  --  he coughed- " a lady ? " It was the funniest , most audacious spiel she had ever heard , though she doubted she understood half of what was going on . " What , " she asked , " what , what did Harker do ? " " Oh , he raised sand . " " A grain , " she squealed , giddily , " a grain that grew up to be rock . " " No , this was hell , " he laughed , " and when he got through with that , he raised the devil . " " And Ada ? " she asked . " I know Ada raised ' something strange . " He sobered . " Well , " he said . " You know womens do n't never have such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make some further joke , but he said nothing . They were both silent now , and awkward after the shared laughter . " Bertie was a gambler , was n't he , Nathan ? " she askedp153suddenly , remembering the avidness with which he had returned to the river , the previous absences from which he had come back flushed , excitable , or , as often , ill-tempered and silent . She had n't known herself that she knew enough to ask this and she was frightened at her perception . But having asked she could not quit the subject . " Was n't he ? " she asked again as Nathan hesitated . " Yes 'm , " he said . Sighing heavily , he looked at her steadily . " Yes 'm , he is . " " Why did n't Mammy tell me ? " Rufel wailed , feeling more betrayedby Mammy 's silence than by Bertie 's deception . Had they conspired against her , plotted together to keep her in the dark ? " It was n't her place . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I spect she tried , " Nathan said drily . " And what was you going to do way out here by yourself , if you had knowed ? " What mamma had written must be true , she thought , a wastrel , a petty scoundrel ; how much had he borrowed over the years ? " Maybe Dorcas was wrong , " Nathan said , " maybe she should have told you flat out front what she knowed . And maybe if she had knowed up front , before you was married , she might 've tried to say something . But she did n't know and once yo'all got out here  --  You was happy ; all that time , least she thought you was happy , and that was what yo'all both wanted . " Rufel looked mutely at Nathan . He was saying that she had n't wanted to know ; that she had kept herself from knowing the truth about Bertie . She looked away . There would be no Mammy when Bertie came back to abet her in the pretense . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , to think , " I guess it 's time for me to go . " He rose and touched his hat . " Mis'ess . " Rufel walked back to the house in a daze . She had n't known Bertie either , had purposefully kept herself from knowing him . Even now she could not recall his features ; oh , she remembered that he had blue eyes and dark hair , that he was handsome . But for the life of her , she could n't see these features in any familiar configuration . What else had she refused to see ? she wondered bitterly  |p154Bertie  was dead . Rufel walked on , considering this possibility more calmly than she would ever have thought possible . He had gone off a week or two without word before . She had received not so much as a note during the whole time he had gone that first summer . But even he would not go off and stay so long without a word . Truely he must be dead . And if Bertie were dead  --  Five thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House quietly , deep in thought . Hearing a slight noise as she started past the bedroom door , she stopped , pushing the door open silently . The wench stood by the window , her back to the door . Rufel paused , uncertain ; the wench was n't supposed to be on her feet yet . " Just a minute , Ada , " the wench said withoutturning and bent to step into her drawers ; briefly her breasts and hips were reflected in the dresser mirror . Only then did Rufel realize that the wench was naked ; her bottom was so scarred that Rufel had thought she must be wearing some kind of garment . " I know you said tomorrow , " the girl said without looking up , as she secured the drawers about her waist . Barely managing to suppress the quick gasp of sympathy surprisedfrom her by that glimpse of the dark body , and acutely embarrassed , Rufel closed the door . The wench 's loins looked like a mutilated cat face . Scar tissue plowed through her pubic region so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakly against the door , regretting what she had seen . The wench had a right to hide her scars , her pain , Rufel thought , almost in tears herself . Impulsively , she opened the bedroom door . " Odessa  --  " and stopped , unsure of what to say . The wench had snatched up a dress and stood stiffly with it clutched in front of her bare chest . Rufel sensed the smoldering hostility beneath the girl 's obvious embarrassment and flushed painfully , recalling how she 'd tried to argue the girl down about Mammy . " That other day "  --  she stopped and cleared her throat  --  " that other day , we was n't talking about the same person . Your mammy birthed you , and mines , mines just helped to raise me . But she loved me , " she could n't help adding , " she loved me , just like yours loved you . " The wench watched her narrowly for a moment ; slowly herp155tensely held shoulders relaxed . " I know that , Mis'ess , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without anger or regret . Rufel , suddenly conscious again of the wench 's half-nakedness , started . " I 'll pull this door to so you can have some privacy while you dress . " Rufel and Nathan made love for the first time later that week . Nathan came to the House in afternoon . Rufel was in the bedroom and heard him ordering Annabelle out . He walked into the bedroom without knocking , closed the door behind him , told her to take off her clothes . He spoke with such authority that almost without thought her hand moved to the drawstring at her bosom . She caught herself and laughed nervously as she dropped her hand . He took her in his arms . It was no laughing matter after that and she clung to him as he undid her bodice with practiced ease . He picked her up , his mouth already nuzzling at her breast . His tongue left trails of liquid fire along her flesh . He eased between her thighs , entering that nameless deep , filling that lonely cavern . Will-less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand nights and endless stars . Nathan had told Rufel the truth , though he later assured her that his first mistress had been no where near as pretty as she and , by the time he knew her , she had not been so young either . Headstrongand smart , Miz Lorraine  --  he never identified her beyond this  --  had inherited a large fortune at an early age . There had been none to curb her wild nature and not until she was almost forty  --  near as he could figure it ; she held her age well  --  had she allowed herself to be " stifled , " as she called it , by " the chains of matrimony . " Prior to that she had taken slave lovers , bought from friends or sent up from her own plantation off the Georgia seacoast . She took them young  --  Nathan was barely fifteen when he was sent up to town , but already the size of his shoulders , his hands , and feet gave promise of the man he would grow into . He was apprehensiveat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back stairway Miz Lorraine 's maid led him up openedp156into the mistress 's bedroom . He looked around wildly for the maid when Miz Lorraine told him to strip , sure that he could n't have heard right . The maid had already disappeared . Frightened half out of his mind  --  Miz Lorraine had on something he knew he could see through if he looked  --  he did what she told him ; and was totallyunable to achieve an erection . Miz Lorraine laughed , gently , mockingly , and made him sit on the edge of the bed . She knelt before him and took his penis in her mouth . Terrified , he at first tried fumblingly to pry her head away , but already her mouth and tongue were sending such intensewaves of pleasure through him that all he could do was hold her head and moan  --  and try to control the muscle that threatened to leap from his control . " Mistress , " he whispered frantically , " Mistress , " trying to pull her head away now , " Mistress , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so she would understand him but terrified of coming in her mouth . " Mist  --  " He could hold it no longer . The power of his climax rocked him back on the bed and he lay there , waiting for her to denounce him , to call the laws , but uncaring . She squirmed onto his still erect penis . Her lips still wet with his come , she sought his mouth . Faintly repelled but alreadyexcited by the pull of her vaginal muscles on his penis , he turned his lips toward hers . " If you ever breathe a word of this to anybody , I 'll chop it off , " she breathed then . He believed her , but the threat did n't deflate him ; rather the knowledge that he lay in danger , not only of his member but of his life , sent him plunging up a peak of unspeakable desire . Miz Lorraine took her bedmates young , saw that they learned some more conventional trade , and , about the time their fear of discovery and their awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues with her and might have boasted to others , about that time she got rid of them , sold them off . Nathan was young enough when he came to her that it took a long time for him to reach that stage , at least in front of her . He believed Miz Lorraine implicitly when she told him , with a finger over his lips , that talking to niggers was like trying to get monkeys to talk ( it was even longer before he thought to ask himself what fucking niggers wasp157like ) , and she , for one , did not want to do it . By the time Nathan found his voice , he also understood ( or thought he did ) something of why his mistress chose her belly-warmers from among the lowestof the low . Nature was strong in her ; she did not call on him that often , no more than once or twice every month or so , but when she did , she kept him awake most of the night and sometimeskept him for a day or even two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men , even ones outside her own class , she would have had no way of ensuring their silence . If a black man boasted , she could have his life . He never learned who else , if anyone , besides her maid knew of the mistress 's habits . He talked to no one about what he did and no one talked to him . This was what Miz Lorraine wanted : to be in control . She was not as freakish as some of the white men people whisperedabout ; she would copulate orally with him , but only once did she allow Nathan to serve her so . He did so , not because he wanted to  --  he never did get used to coming in her mouth  --  but because he thought it was expected . He had been with enough women to know that , usually , they did to you what they wanted you to do to them . While this was a wholly new thing to him and still slightly distasteful , it gave him such joy that he was not averse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her , and himself , by surprise , his tongue flicking across that little slippery piece he knew got delight from his fingers almost before he was aware of what he was doing . She had writhed and kicked but he held on till he felt the thick come against his tongue . She threatened to yell rape that night ; to sell him , to have him flayed within an inch of his life . He never took the lead in sex with her again . At what point Miz Lorraine began to take his silence for sense , Nathan never knew , but she kept him longer , she said , than she had any other slave lover and promised to put him out to stud rather than sell him . He had n't looked forward to that . He was thoroughly enraptured by her and he liked Savannah . He loved his work as coachman , the driving , his smart livery , the horses . He felt also , but so dimly he could not have articulated it , that there was something demeaning in what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan could see on a whim , to marry and , contrary to her word , had sold him to Wilson . He understood the reasons for her betrayal  --  he had never dared boast of his relationship with her , but on that plantation , away from the twin goads of fear and desire , he was n't sure he could have held his tongue , as he had not been able to once settled at the Glen . He had tried to be philosophical about the change in his fortune . Driver was a brutal job , but Wilson had not been an especially brutal master . He had rather favored Nathan ; the latter did his job and knew how to return an amusing quip without seeming uppity . Had Nathanbeen more inclined toward harshness , he might have stood higher in Wilson 's esteem . As it was , knowing something of the hardships to which most slaves were subjected , he would not complain . Miz Lorraine had given him what few niggers even dreamed about . There was , he told the men in the Quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white woman 's pussy and he knew because he had had his share of black women both before and after Miz Lorraine . It was not , as he liked to claim , that they had snapping pussy that held on to your dick until the last little seed was drained , then opened to let you fill again . It was the terror , he knew , that made it so sweet . If climax , as some men said , was like death , then a nigger died a double death in a white woman 's arms . And he had survived it . He walked a little taller , aware of the power hanging secret and heavy between his legs . Nathan was the color of eggplant , a rich , velvety blue-black ; beside him , Rufel 's skin took on a pearly glow . They sweated and rested , his face buried in her bosom , one leg caught between hers . She stroked his back ; his fingers played purposefully in matted pubic hair , teasing the slick lips of her vagina . Supine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard the door open , only the startled gasp : " Mis  --  Nathan ! " Surprised , Rufel saw the wench 's face , wide-eyed with shock , over Nathan 's shoulder and glimpsed Ada 's bandanna.  | " Nathan , " the wench breathed again , striding into the room , " and Miz Ruint  --  Well , I knew you was a fool  --  " " Dessa ! " Nathan shouted , rising . " What you call me ? " Rufel cried . " Miz Ruint ! " Odessa repeated harshly , deliberately , struggling now in Ada 's grasp . Nathan was out of the bed then ; together he and Ada got Odessa , breathing hard but no longer struggling , out of the room . Nathan closed the door and turned to Rufel . " What 's that she called me , Nathan ? " Rufel asked . " Rufel , " Nathan said , grinning slowly , widely . " Miz Rufel ; that 's what she meant . " He held out his hand to her . " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was what the wench had said . Ruined . That was what she meant.  |p163I  never seed such a thing ! Nathan  --  laying cross that white woman  --  Black as night and so  --  so satisfied . It was like seeing her nurse Mony for the first time all over again . I was that surprised to walk in on them . I seed the name upset her , so I said it again out of plain meanness ; I wanted to call her something worse . All the while I was yelling at her , Nathan and Ada was hustling me out that room . And something inside me was screaming , Ca n't I have nothing ? Ca n't I have nothing ? Well , I went , just about stumbling down them back steps with Ada fussing in behind me . I 'd " gone too far , " she say , calling that white woman out her name . Miz Rufel been " good to us . " Oh , yes , the white woman was " Miz Rufel " to her then  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman Miz Ruint in the first place . Anyway , far as I was concerned , that white woman was the one 'd " gone too far , " laying up with a black man . And Nathan . I was so mad at him , I could 've spit . Ada huffed at me all the way cross the yard : We was all going get put off the place ; if I wanted that " fool negro , " I could have him when Miz Lady was through with him . I turned round on that one . I could feel trouble all round me and in me , and pain ;  |p164she  was talking like all I needed was a little belly-rub . " You put Annabelle name in this mess , " she say . And forgot Mony ; remembranceof him did n't come to me till then . I 'd forgot him just that quick , when it was him we 'd gone in that room to peek at in the first place . You know , any other time , Miz Lady  --  which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , it was always Mis'ess or Miz Rufel . But everyone , Nathan included , called her Miz Ruint , too  --  amongst ourselfs ; this was the name Annabelle give her . Both names meant about the same to me , though Ruint did fit her . Way she was living up there in them two rooms like they was a mansion , making out like we was all her slaves . For all the world like we did n't know who we was or how poor she was . Them rooms was big all right , but it was only two of them , same as any poor buckra ; and that stairway did n't lead to no other story . It ended right smack dab against the roof before it had gone ten good steps . We all knew something was n't right up there . And any other time , she'd 've been out to the woods someplace , way she did most afternoons when I put Mony down for nap . That 's where me and Ada both thought she was when we seed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen the way we was , we never even seen the white woman , neither Nathan , go in the House . Was n't no way in the world we'd 've just walked in that room if we 'd knowed she was in there  --  I 'm saying " me and Ada , " but I knowed Ada was n't that much in it . I was the one had mocked the white woman in public . For the first time I wanted to cry . I could n't go back in that House , not to get Mony , not and see Nathan , see him and that white woman again . The remembrance of them in that bed kept stabbing at my eyes , my heart black white red . I knowed that red was her hair , but it looked like blood to me . I moved down to the Quarters that evening . Tell the truth , I did n't have that much to move , just Mony ( and Ada 'd had to go back to the House and get him ) and the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by Miz Ruint , just like most everythingelse I had . It chafed me to be so beholden to her . For thep165life of me , I could n't see no reason for a white woman to let us stay there  --  less it was for devilment . I 'd only heard of " good masters "  --  I did n't know nothing about no good white folks  --  and none of them claimed Miz Ruint was a " good master . " No " good master " would 've let us stay anyway . So why she would do this was a puzzlement to me . Letting us stay on the place was n't zactly slave stealing , true enough , but I knowed she was posed to tell somebody we was there . Would n't the white folks get her for keeping runaways ? She could n't be letting all these peoples stay just so she could lay with a black man , I told myself . Could she ? And I was scared . Ada was right , Miz Ruint could make us all leave . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going pick that crop , feed that boy , mend them draws ? But she could , you know ; she was white and it was her place . I could n't just go round popping off at the mouth any old kind of how  --  least ways not at her . I had plenty I wanted to say to Nathan but I had n't seed him since he put us out that door . The Quarters was n't no better than what Ada had said  --  one room with a dirt floor ; was n't even no chinking in between the logs . Harker and them 'd added a lean-to where the mens slept and I moved into the cabin with the womens . I had walked down to the Quarters a time or two when Ada took dinner down , helping her lug that big kettle once I got my strength back . I knew most of the peoples by sight , and all of them knew Mony . He never wanted for lap nor arm long as a person was in the Quarters . There was three other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet , a little string-bean woman ( both of them worked the fields ) ; and Milly , a old woman with a ulcerated foot who helped Ada with the laundry and tried to work that loom Dorcas had used . I kept the House , helped Ada in the kitchen , and did the sewing , mending really . I could do decent plain stitch and darn ; this what our mammy taught all of us , so we knowed how to be neat . But I could n't bit more cut a dress or do nothing fancy than a man in the moon . Even this was better than what Miz Ruint could do and I set some store by it . There was eight mens , counting Nathan-nem . Uncle Joel and hisp166grand-boy , Dante , belonged to the place . Uncle Joel had been sold more times than he could count ; white folks just call him to the House and point to his new master . That last time , he figured his old master was using him to settle some small debt . He begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present to the new master 's son . Being as his arm and leg was crippled on one side , no one valued Dante but Uncle Joel ( though Dante could do just about anything peoples with two good arms and legs could do ) . Master Man , that 's what Uncle Joel called Miz Ruint 's husband ; made it sound like something nasty , too . Master Man had n't wanted either one of them and plained all the way home about getting the worst of the deal . Ned was a young fellow round about the same age as me ; Castor and Red was both about the age of Harker . We did n't none of us know how old we was , but near as I could figure out , I think Harker must 've been close to thirty . I was n't no more than seventeen or eighteen myself . All the mens worked the fields except for Uncle Joel ; he tended the garden which House and Quarters both ate from , and the few head of stock . Nathan mostly hunted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not everybody , every evening , but usually peoples sat out there a minute or so before turning in ; sometimes Ada would sit a spell when she brought supper or walk down again after we 'd cleaned up . Mostly I guess they was quiet peoples do n't talk too much in the heat , not after they been in the fields all day . Oh , sometimes they did talk , now and then trade stories , or Uncle Joel would play his mouth organ . I had heard it once or twice wailing faint through the night when I was laying up at the House . Sadder than a whippoorwill , more lonesone than a owl , it wrung my heart ; it reminded me so much of home . But these was n't like my home Quarters , and I sat there that first night holding Mony , feeling like a stranger amongst them . The weather , the crop , this is what they talked about ; Milly 's foot , Mony  --  but Mony was sleep  --  the weather again . It was hot . Harker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spected Nathan was up to that House . Even Ada and Annabelle was there , but Adap167had n't more than said good evening to me . The rest of them spoke and I could feel the ones had seed me bring my pallet down wanting to ask why I 'd moved . No one did but they could n't seem to keep a conversation going . Long about the time Harker and Cully walked up , someone inquiredafter Nathan ; after everybody say good evening , Janet inquiredagain . I did n't say nothing . Ada waited a minute , then she say , " Up to the House . " No one said nothing to that ; then she say , " Laying up with Miz Lady . " Do n't nobody say nothing then ; finally Harker slap his thigh and laugh . " Doggone it , Cully , " he say , " I did n't believe old Nathan'ddo it ! " Cully let out a big whoop . " Miz Lady bound to come in on the deal now ! " I could n't believe my ears ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that white woman was n't part of no deal I knowed about , Harker , " I told him . Everybody was talking at once , but he turned around when I said that . " What got you so mad , Dessa ? " he ask . " That 's a white woman , Harker . " They all quieted down when I said that . " She willing , " Harker say , dry as dust . That 's the way he try to be , so calm do n't nothing faze him . Well , that give them all a big laugh , till Ada say , " That fool negro going to get us all killed . " " Ai n't no such a thing , " Harker say real sharp , " less one of us going tell it . " This made us all shut up . Was n't none of us going tell and I reckon he knowed that well as I did , but I think his putting it so harsh made us see that we was all liable . Knowing about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at least to the white folks . Then , just like he could n't help hisself , Harker burst out , " West , here we come . " And the men commence to dance around and laugh . Harker come took Mony , gived him to Ada , and pulled me top168my feet . Trying to waltz me around , you know , but I did n't feel like no dancing and I shook his hands off . " This how we going work our way West , " I ask him , " on our backs ? " I got Mony and went on in the cabin and laid down . I could hear them going on about Nathan and the white woman . Harker allowed as how he would n't mind being a fly on the wall do the white man ever come back and catch them . Not that he was wishing for them to be caught , understand ; he could n't wish that on no brother . But just so 's he could see the white man 's face . " Reckon his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know that mouth would gape something scandalous , and he would get red . Got to get red . But he just might be carried off in apoplexybefore he could do anything to him or her . " By this time , they was all laughing fit to be tied ; I wanted to laugh myself cause it was true . A slave loving with the mistress , the master 's wife , might be enough to give a white man the stroke . I could see my old master 's face turning red  --  might even go purple  --  asthe sight of that fly in his milk and death hit him all at once . Course his eyes would pop . Mine had . But I was n't in no mood to laugh ; Master might get red , but if Master lived , the slave was dead . Nathan could die tomorrow cause of this mess . I was mad at him for letting that white woman put him in such risk and I was mad at her for doing it . Nathan and Cully , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out my head ; Ada said that was the only thing kept me quiet they hands , they eyes , they voice . These had stood between me and death or me and craziness . We 'd opened to each others . Oh , I had a admiration for them  --  same as they did for me . We had scaped , honey ! And they 'd come back for me and we 'd scaped again . You did n't do this in slavery . We laughed about it  --  they teased me about the white man what " kept company " with me while I was in that cellar ; I said they 'd been sparking the girls in the Quarters , that 's what took them so long to see about me  --  but it was this that brought us close . We talked about some of everything while I was laid up in thatp169bed , and they was some talkers . Cully could have you dying about his old master trying to raise him as a slave and like a son  --  teachinghim to read but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nathan would fascinate you with stories about outlandish goingons . And Harker got us all fired up about West . He could put some words together , make you see broad , grassy valleys , clear , sparklingstreams , a river that divided slave land from free . And was n't no pretense between us . Mammy was n't no more to Cully than breast in the night and he never knew enough to wonder about her till after he was sold . Somebody had carried him like I carried Mony ; he 'd kicked in a stomach same way Mony did in mine . But he might as well been carried in a bottle for all he knowed . Mammy was n't even a face to him . Cully cried when he told us this and I was the one held him , right there on that feather bed . But we all heard ; and Nathan , neither Harker was shamed of they tears . I never thought one of them could be so ignorant to something that hurt me so bad . White woman was everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them would want to love with her . I thought " the deal " was a joke when Nathan and Harker first started talking about selling theyself back into slavery so as to get a stake big enough to where we could all leave from round there . This was a story they was telling to help while away the hours Ada made me stay in bed . Harker had the idea of someone posing as the master and of the peoples running away after they 'd been sold and the " master " selling them again in another town . This was what his old master used to do with him when they was down on the luck . Harker 's master was a regular scamp , gambling , mostly  --  he 'd won Harker in a card game in Kentucky when Harkerwas about leven or twelve  --  and high living , but he was n't above a swindle or a cheat now and then . At first , Cully was " master "  --  except for that nappy hair , he could 've been white , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with half a eye could see he was too young to be out trying to sell a gang of negroes , and we joked about having Har/ker paint a mustache on him to make him look older . Harker had learned this from his master , too . It was Nathan put that white woman in it . Oh , not by name ; but once they got the idea was n't but a step to seeing if it would work . And for that , like Nathan said , we needed a real white person , someone in want , to play the master . I did n't think about the idea of us selling ourselfs or each others back into slavery long as I took it for fun , you know . But I was uneasy , once they put the white folk in it . Was n't no white folk I 'd ever heard of would bit more go along with this cutup than a man in the moon  --  and if they did , it would just be to cheat us out the money in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 'd told right there by that bed  --  bad jobs made good and the daddies not even getting thanks , promises of freedom or favor the white folks never kept . So it was hard for me to see this as anything but a joke . Even when Harker said he thought Miz Lady could use some money and Cully said he 'd oversee the place  --  since he was so white  --  while they was gone , I did n't believe they would trust her . So I  --  just to keep the story going  --  I said I better go along to keep a eye on her . I did n't think they had the nerve to ask such a thing , but I begun to back off . Who going nurse the babies ? I asked them . It hurt me to my deepest heart not to nurse my baby . Made me shamed , like I was less than a woman . And to have him nursing on her . . . Oh , I accepted it . Was n't no choice ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this was n't no more to her than nursing her own child . Miz Ruint was so forgetful , I told them , till she just might forget herself if Mony cried and plump out that titty in public  --  trying to make a joke of it , but yet and still , trying to get them to see the point of how dangerous it was trusting in somebody could be that careless . Well , they laughed ; thought I 'd hit Miz Lady off real good . She did know the difference between black and white ; I give her that . She was n't that foolish . But where white peoples look at black and see something ugly , something hateful , she saw color . I knowed this , but I could n't understand it and it scared me . Butp171this was why Harker and them thought she might would go along with the plan . Harker , neither Red encouraged too much conversation about Nathan and the white woman  --  Red say it was too much like talking in the man 's bed . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did n't none of them know that much about it , but Harker talked about it like he 'd seen the forests and the streams , the river where slavery could n't cross over cause everybody on that side was free . I do n't know if I really believe all that , land and rivers , and crossing over . It sound pretty spooky to me ; yet and still , it appealed to me . Slavery not being allowed ; everybody free . I 'd traveledso far from my old home and still had n't come to the end of slavery ; Harker say we could travel that far and farther and still not come to a place where our peoples could live free . It scared me to think how much of the world was slaved . I 'd taken a dream out of slavery  --  the one Kaine gived me about freedom . Many the day I cursed freedom ; it took everyone I loved in girlhood from me . It taken Kaine . I 'd come out of slavery with nothing but that dream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them strange Quarters , that the dream had come true . I was n't slaved no more ; I 'd slept in the white folks ' bed and used the white folks ' things , been used by them . Yes , freedom had come true , but in ways I 'd never thought of and with hurts I did n't know I could bear . That dream had to be something worth living for , if not for me , then for Mony ; West had to be better than here . This what I thought when I listened to Harker talking about West while I was laying up there in the white woman 's bed , jokingwith them about that plan . But out there in the Quarters that night , with Mony nested in the curve of my side , all I seed as I listened was Nathan sprawled in whiteness , white sheets , white pillows , white bosom . All he did was make them look whiter . He was n't nothing but a mark on them . That 's what we was in white folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out . Had n't I seed it in Mistress , in that white man 's eyes under the tree ? Wep172was n't nothing to them . I could n't trust all we had to something could swallow us like so many drops ; I made up my mind not to put my freedom in no white woman 's hand . Nathan stopped me that next morning as I was coming through the woodlot carrying Mony . It was n't no more than just light , he was in the shadows leaning against a tree trunk . My heart did kind of leap up when I seed him ; I was glad he 'd come to me . Course , by the time I got to him , I membered I had some things to be mad with him about . I was finding out just how convenient it had been to live at the Big House . Oh , the mattress was the same  --  I 'd taken that corn-husk pallet down with me  --  and I like to suffocate in that little hidey-hole Dorcas slept in . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back late on account of her nursing Mony . I started giving him a little grits in milk before I left the House in the evening and , after a while , he slept through the night . But he did n't the first night in the Quarters . I managed to get him back to sleep  --  Janet made him a sugar-tit from a corner of molasses she 'd saved  --  but not before everybody in the Quarters was wake . They was too polite to say anything , but I could hear them tossingand turning well as they could hear me . So I was n't in no mood to let Nathan know how glad I was to see him . " Dessa , " he say when I got up to him , " what is wrong with you ? " Not " Morning , " not " How do ? " It was " What is wrong with you ? " Like I was the one crazy . I was so surprised and hurt  --  cause it was real evident to me who and what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a person , " I said over my shoulder , " and you got to treat me like I got some sense . " " Why do n't you act like you got some , then ? " he said real snappy , but after a minute , he come to walk beside me and asked , like he want an answer , " Why is you mad , Dess ? " I thought he should already know that . I had told him what Master had done to Kaine and I knew he had seen how Young Mistress had used me . White folks had taken everything in thep173world from me except my baby and my life and they had tried to take them . And to see him , who had helped to save me , had friended with me through so much of it , laying up , wallowing in what had hurt me so  --  I did n't feel that nothing I could say would tell him what that pain was like . And I did n't feel like it was on me to splain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I thought it was on him to say why he was doing it . " Why not ? " he ask when I ask him . Well , that stop me right in my tracks . " Why not ? " I ask . " What you going to do if her husband come back ? " " What we going to do if he come back ? " he shot back real quick . " From what she say , he just as likely to lay claim to us and sell us all right back into slavery . " " And he sho will be disposed to do just that , he come back and find you sleeping in that bed . " He grinned . " So you think Master Sutton going give us a square deal , do I stop diddling his wife , eh ? " That lie-gap between his front teeth was gleaming and I could n't help but laugh  --  which was what he wanted me to do . You know most mens feel if they can get you laughing and funning , talkinga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just anything they want with you . And I guess it is true that you catch more flies with sugar . But I was right ; and I was n't going be laughed out of it . " You just liking her cause she white , " I told him . " Yeah , " he say , " I likes her cause she white ; I likes you cause you got that old pretty red color under your skin . Now what of that ? " I could 've hit him , he was making me so mad . " You know what I mean ! " " If you mean that I 'm getting something that the white man alwayskept for hisself , well , yes . I likes that , too . " " If the white man ai n't no good , ' how his likes ' or his woman going be any different ? " This was another thing he 'd said there by that bed and I wanted him to member that . " You know , Dess , Ruth ai n't the one sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " But he 'd kill you or Harker , or anybody here , for less than what you doing . Maybe for less than what Kaine did , " I added . I did n't like him putting Kaine in it ; and I knowed he called that white woman name just to be cute . " Ruth , " like she was n't no more than his friend-girl . He could show off all he wanted to , try to make it seem like it was all in my mind . I knowed what had killed Kaine , the master 's power ; and poor or not , every white man had that when it come to a nigger . " Why you doing something you know ca n't mean you no good ? " " Felt plenty good to me . " " That ai n't no answer . " " Why I got to have a better one ? " I just looked at him . To hear him tell it , he had n't suffered as much as some people  --  he said he had belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before he was sold  --  but he knew , had seen what others had been through . The reason he runned away in the first place was cause he could n't stand having his own luck depend on having to hurt others . He did n't think I knowed this , would n't want me to know it , but I did . Maybe there was some little black drivers in slavery . But every one I ever seen was big and black and they whole idea of theyselfs was in they strength ; that was the white man 's " arm " and that was the only way they knew to be . Well , Nathan was big and black but I do n't think he knew nothing about no white man 's arm until he was sold to that slave trader . Maybe he was too old to like it by then , maybe it just was n't in him to like all that bullying and beating . But he had to act like he did or at least act like it did n't make him no difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he still did n't like to show too much of hisself that was n't like what people generally thought a big , black nigger should be . But Nathan was different ; and I knowed he was different . I could n't put into words all this that was going through my head . I did n't have the words , the experience to say these things . All I could do was feel and it was like my own flesh had betrayed me . Nathan and Cully , and Harker , too , had risked something for me and I felt bound to them  --  and them to me  --  as tight as blood/kin . Miz Ruint was n't no part of that knot ; the only way she could get in was to loosen it . Maybe I would have felt this way about anyone but this was a white woman  --  and a crazy white woman at that . Well , with the answers Nathan was giving the questions I was asking , did n't neither one of us get no satisfaction . So I resented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mending out to the kitchen yard . I was n't going let my tongue run away like that again , but I did n't want to be round the white woman . I had n't never had that much to say to her , no way . She was always strange to me , way she was always looking at me when she thought I did n't know it , other times acting like she was scared I would touch her . I did n't like her eyes  --  though they was n't as bad as that writer man 's had been . His was about as empty as a snow sky , just that pale and heavy ; hers was gray as wet mortar . But , most times , it was like she did n't see you , no way  --  and be talking right at you . She left her dirty draws in the middle of the floor when that 's the first thing you teach a child : Pick up behind yourself . She called Ada " Auntie " like they was some kin . Ada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did I know  --  I had n't been more than a mile or so from my home Quarters till I was sold . Most of what I knowed about white folk , I 'd learned on that coffle . Ada had worked in Houses from the time she was old enough to know anything and I do n't reckon it was much white folks could get past her . She had come out from a pretty strict-run House , the kind where the mistress weigh out the provision in the morning and lock them up at night ; you know , order everything about the House just so . Her old mistress was one of these see-nothing , say-nothing white womens when it come to the master . And he slept with all the womens in his Quarters ; said it kept them fertile . Ada was her master 's daughter  --  though it did n't get her no special favor ; she just happen to be one the childrens he kept . He did n't have nothing to do with Annabelle  --  only white on her had come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hadn't 've been the master started looking at An/nabelle . That was his granddaughter , mind , and she not even thirteen . Ada tried to get the mistress to stop him , but mistress say , do n't bring that kind of talk in her House . This was one of the first things Ada told me about herself : " He did n't have to be so low . " Lips trembling , eyes like a bruise in her face , swimming in water , and I was back in my home Quarters hearing my friendgirlMartha 's voice : " All he had to do was ask , " after Master 's brother forced her in the fields one day . Oh , I was spared much that others suffered . And Ada tell you in a minute , white woman ai n't got no excuse to be so trifling when all it take is they word . Aunt Lefonia and Emmalina had said about the same thing . They did n't have too much patience with white womens amongst theyselfs  --  though they never let on about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves . Not that they talked that much about white womens in particular ; they talked about everyone come near that House . But this was Ada 's favorite conversation ; Miz Ruint did n't know how to keep no House ; was n't for Dorcas , Miz Ruined be dead . Tell you the truth , I was n't much interested in that white woman ; used to be , quite a bit of the time , Ada would talk , and I would n't listen . But now , with Harker and them acting so closed to me , I began to pay attention . Ada had been on the place even before the master took off . She 'd come from up around Huntsville and she and Annabelle was pretty wore out by the time they got that far . They stole or grubbed what they could in the woods . This is what all the people came there did : run , beg , steal , starve , run . And all the time not really knowingwhere you going , just that you ca n't go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask for work , ask for food ; sometimes , if there was n't no dogs , they could get food in the Quarters . But it was n't too many Quarters round there , was n't too many farms . That 's why Ada stayed around . White folks there did n't keep too close watch over black people ; they thought it was so few up that way that they knew them all . Well , Dorcas friended Ada ; Ada taken a chance when no one else was n't about and asked Dorcas for food , which Dorcas givedp177her . She and Annabelle had found a cave not far from the Quarters ; they stayed round there in the day , slept there and only come out at night . When the master left , Ada moved into the cook-shack . So she had good reason to know about the white woman 's business . And she did run on about her : Miz Ruint think that shiftless husband of hers a gentleman ; she do n't know nothing about slaves . " Tell you , dearie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples , she do n't know how to talk to no darky . " We was setting out there at that big slab-top table under the tree where Ada was canning . We had made up ; she really was glad someone had said something to Miz Ruint . She just wished I had n't called Annabelle'sname  --  which , a course , I had n't . But was n't no use trying to tell Ada that ; once she got an idea in her head , it was like trying pull hen teeth to get it out . I knew I was n't entirely without fault myself  --  I really was trying to watch my tongue  --  so I just went on and begged her pardon . Anyway , it was that fool negro ( meaningNathan ) that Ada was most put out with . " You know this ai n't the first white woman Nathan done loved with , " she told me , like this ought to make some difference in how I felt . But I did n't believe her . Ada thought I was just jealoushearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of making what she called a fool of myself over a negro did n't have no better sense than Nathan . He 'd stayed with his first mistress because he was doing her " a . . . a service , " she told me . Well , I almost laughed at that . For a black man to even think under a white woman 's clothes was death and here she was telling me Nathan had a habit of doing this with them ? It was bad enough , his doing it with one ; only way I could splain that was that they was both crazy . But , stead of arguing , I agreed with her about the sense part though I knew for a fact Nathan had plenty . But , see , Nathan was one of these what you call red-eyed negroes . You know , the kind of negro get his shirt soiled in hell and go to heaven for a change of clothes  --  so he can go back and " study " hell some more . You knew this was wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mens thought Nathan 's rutting up there with a white woman was a fine turnaround , so Ada said , after the wayp178white mens was always taking our womens . Not all white mens acted animals towards us , understand , but enough of them did till this is what we always feared with them  --  and what our mens feared for us . I was spared this in bondage , but I had seen the way some white mens looked at me , big belly and all , when I was on that coffle . The womens did n't get as much kick out of Nathan and Miz Ruint as the mens . Janet said Nathan should 've raped her or at least knocked her round a little since this what he was going be cused of anyway . Even Milly did n't see how neither one of them could go round the place so unconcerned like what they was doing was n't a danger to us all . By and large though , no one had too much to say . Harker said it was Nathan 's business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it to Nathan 's face . Ada told me this , you understand ; did n't nobody say nothing to me . I was the " devil woman " ; this was between me and " my mens . " The rest of them was all trying to keep out of it . I know the peoples did n't mean no harm by that name ; in fact , they was proud of it  --  one of our womens helping to best the white folks , scaring a white man half to death . I did n't no ways look like I could do all that . I mean , I was sturdy  --  you had to be sturdy  --  but I ai n't built big . All the peoples got a kick out of this , me so small , jumping white mens . But I had n't never liked that name , not from the first time I heard Jemina say it . And now they begin to take this in another way and look at me like maybe that " devil woman " was n't such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying Miz Ruint was the one touched in the head . Looking at me funny like I was the one ungrateful  --  or lamebrained , choosing corn husk when I could 've had feather . Did n't no one just come right out and say this , you understand . They just act like it . Did n't no one say nothing to me ; and Ada was about the only one I said something to . Still , they was uneasy about Nathan ; man or woman they was uneasy . White mens would kill to keep something like this quiet . We was all worried that another white person would find out about this  --  though really , the onliest white person I 'd seen sincep179I 'd been there was a peddler she bought some flower seeds off of . Did n't no one visit her . This is why we felt a little safe there ; she lived so cut off . But this with her and Nathan  --  seem like it was something white folks would just know . White woman sent word by Cully that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged pardon for calling her out her name . Well , that was fine with me , I told him , cause I was n't goi-g no place with her , no ways . Ada hooted . We was setting around to the side of the cabin in the shade when Cully walked up , so I guess this must have been a Sunday . The others was about , mostly I spect down to the fishing hole cause it was hot . Cully was n't nothing but a boy , remind me of my brother Jeeter , way his wrists was always showing under his sleeves  --  big , heavy bones , look like they going pop the skin . Oh , they was n't nothing alike in color ; Jeeter look like midnight beside Cully 's day . But something in the way Cully carried hisself put me in mind of Jeeter . I think this how I first come to note Cully . I was n't nothing but a little girl last time I seed Jeeter and he was the age Cully look to be . Jeeter never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , sharp as the day they sold him . " Nathan put you up to this , huh , and Harker ? " I asked Cully . He was like a little puppy dog when it come to them , was n't nothing they could say or do was wrong to him . Used to be was n't nothing I said wrong with him , neither , till all this come up . Oh , I had a lot to be hot with Miz Ruint about and I would 've bit my tongue before I said sorry . " This what Miz Rufel say , " he told me , coloring up like a white girl , he was that light . It made him look about ten years old , which he knew , which made him madder  --  and redder  --  still . He had n't even started hair on his chin , so was n't nothing to hide that blush . For a minute I felt kind of bad about taking my spite out on him . But then I thought about him carrying word for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Specially not on no cork-brained scheme like the one Harker talking about . "  |p180Well  , this answer put them all out with me , cause they was all hot behind Harker 's plan . Even Castor and Milly  --  they was the scariest ones  --  thought it was a good trick to pull on the white folks . Harker could n't do no wrong , far as they was all concerned . Castor and Flora and them had worked the fields all they life ( me , too , come to that ) and they could do that hoe , plant , plow ; but had n't none of them ever decided when to plant or what or how much . They just knew how to work ; they did n't know how to direct it , to set it up from plant to harvest of all the crops . And this is what Harker could do . He knew all these things about the land , about planting and keeping it healthy , but he was n't so set up in his own opinion that he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew and what they knew and put it together so the crop that year was looking to be double what they had harvested the year before . This was one thing made all the peoples respect him . Even after Harker come to the Glen and decided to stay a spell , he wandered a lot . ( This is one of the first things I noted about him , that he had been places . I had never known a negro who would just pick up and walk . I mean , I knowed ones to run ; you know , trying to delay that lash , or go off to see someone  --  sweetheart , mother  --  but not just to go cause you feel like it . This was unheard of , far as I knowed . We all belonged to a place and seemed like you was born knowing not to move too far from it . But here was someone who walked around where he wanted to  --  more or less  --  was n't scared to do this . It was one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not afraid of coming or going . ) Harker had come upon Cully and Nathan about three or four days south of there . They had made it that far before Nathan 's leg give out . Oh , yes , a bullet had pierced him in the leg when they scaped from the patterrollers that caught me . Neither one of them knowed what to do with it and it festered . Well , Harker stumbled up on them where they was hid in the woods and got them both back to the Glen , where Ada doctored his leg ; quite naturally they thought highly of him . So , when Harker started talking aboutp181leaving everyone was all set to follow him . This was they leader , they saver , and they was some upset that I was scoffing at his plan . I had a deep admiration for Harker myself but I really did n't like the idea of us selling ourselfs back into slavery . Though , to tell the truth , the plan was n't so foolish as I made out . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked the same question in every town the coffle went through , " Got any niggers for sale ? " Oh , we would fetch some money . And white folks did n't really start thinking someone had run off till they had been gone a day or so and , on a big place , a new person might not be missed for two or three days . Only reason more did n't run away was there was nowheres for them to run to ; and even nowhereswas a hard ways to go . There was terrible whippings if they caught you , which , having nowheres to run to , they mainly did . But , by the time our peoples was looked for , they could be in another town , getting ready to be sold again . If they was caught , they would have a pass ; and they so-called owners might not even recognize them . I had seen what Harker could do with a little of that greasepaint . He did n't make no amazing changes but he did enough so , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different that you 'd think you mistook them for someone else . All this was just in case ; was n't no reason for no one to be caught . Running away was how most everybody had got there in the first place . A gang of peoples could probably work this scheme several times without making no stir . No , there was no doubt it could work from our part , the ones who would be sold . It was the part of the one doing the selling that I had my doubts on . I just knowed there had to be some way for us to get away without having a white person in it at all . And I knowed if Nathanand Harker thought about it , they could find whatever way that was . I put a lot of faith in mens ' minds  --  I thought my brother Jeeter could turn the world around . And , generally speaking , I do believe that if you think about a thing long enough , man or woman , you will find some way to handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  to Harker especially , cause he was the one with the most ideas  --  find this way . Ada argued that we had to trust someone , but I could n't see placing all our dependence on a white woman , white anything for that matter . We all knowed they was wicked and treacherous  --  that 's why we was in the position we was in . And even though I could understand Harker 's point that this did n't necessarily have to turn on that , I did n't want no part of it . " Miz Ruint ai n't turned on us yet ; this deal benefit her same as it do us , " Harker said . This was another evening , maybe a day or so later . We was settingout there front the cabin again ; even Ada had walked down . Nathan was up there at the House and though no one mentioned it , we all knowed that , too . Still , the idea of her , a white person , working for negroes was so comical to me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told him , " Ada vouch for that . " " Maybe she ai n't had nobody else to talk with , " he say . " Dessa , she do got some stake in doing right by us . " " She crazy ; we all know that . You put yourself , your freedom at the mercy of a crazy white woman ? " " It 's not the white woman holding up the deal . She say she willing to do it , " Ned spoke up . I could see Harker shushing him but I was n't going to pay that old mallet-head boy no mind no way . He was always playing tricks on peoples  --  you know , tie your pants leg in knots , rig a bucket to dump water on you as you go in the barn . He was always getting up some devilment like that . Thank God he growed out of it , but he was a pest . And this the way they all act , like I was the only one could play the maid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the one Miz Ruint was putting it on ; I was the one had called her out her name . " How you get here , was n't for taking a chance ? " Harker ask . " You talk about chance , " I told him , " but I know chance . Chance called master , chance called mistress . " Was n't for chance I be loving Kaine right now , I thought , be with my family today . He was right about chance putting me where I was that day . " Howp183long you think we going last amongst white folks with Nathan in her bed ? " I ask him . They was all quiet for a minute ; this was the first time someone had brung this up when we was all together like that since the night I moved down there . Then Janet spoke up . " Well , that is a dumb thing for a negro to do  --  " she start off . But before she can even finish , there was that old mallet-head Ned squawking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause he not diddling you . " Then he say under his breath , " Do n't nobody want no old mule like you , " but loud enough for everyone to hear . And somewheres in the darkness a voice went , " Humph , " like it wanted to laugh but caught itself before the laugh could get out good . And then there was a silence . Silence and a fire-burst where Ned 's head should 've been when I looked at him . I had to close my eyes . Was this what they thought of us ? Mules . I was so choked I could n't speak . I used to warm my feet against Kaine 's legs in winter ; time they got me out that cellar , my heels was so rough they snagged a tear in them sheets up to the House . Janet had that kind of skin remind you of hickory  --  red-brown and tough ; Flora 's skin was smooth as peach peel , hands big and hard ; Ada  --  But Ned was n't talking about no color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in eighteen years and seen them all taken from her as she weaned them , been put outdoors herself when she went two years without starting another child . They had taken Flora 's baby from her , put her out to nurse with someone else cause Flora could do much as any man in the fields . This is what broke Flora from slavery ; this why she runned , so she could keep her babies for herself . Janet was mistreatedcause she was barren ; Ada 's master had belly-rubbed with her , then wanted to use her daughter . I had been spared death till I could birth a baby white folks would keep slaved . Oh , we was mules all right . What else would peoples use like they used us ? And still I wanted Kaine 's lips to nibble at the kitchen on my neck , dirty and damp with sweat , would 've cried to feel the hard chap on his hands catching in my hair . He had smelled like good earthp184after a short rain , kind make your mouth water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat dirt . I was glad he was n't Master , was n't boss  --  these was n't peoples in my book . Had he really wanted me to be like Mistress , I wondered , like Miz Ruint , that doughy skin and slippery hair ? Was that what they wanted ? I could see Ned when I opened my eyes , burr-headed and mallet-shapedas he was . I know Harker made him apologize ; by him being young and so rude like that , somebody had to tell him something . But I do n't know how long it took or how Harker done it . I 'd come to a flash somewhere between " mule " and " humph " ; and I was still shaking from remembrance , from feeling . This was the flash that 'd nelly-bout killed Master and almost strangled Mistress , that rode me in the fight on the coffle . It scared me to see it almost loosed against one of us ; and , pesky as he was , Ned was part of us . Yes , I trembled ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , a monster that did n't seem to know enemynor friend , would n't know the difference once it got loose . Harker was speaking to me . He 'd sent Red back down to Dallascounty to bring out Red 's wife , Debra , and they baby ; she was still nursing and could nurse Mony while we was gone . All they needed now was for me and Miz Lady to come on in . I swallowed down ; that bloodhound was still at my throat and my voice was rough . " Get another mule , " I told him ; " this one do n't know how to be no maid . " They finished stripping the corn and the work slacked off some ; it did n't never just stop . Seem like it was always something to plow , plant , pick , or peel at that place . We rose at the same time but now they sat a little later and talked a little longer in front the cabin at night . One night they encouraged Uncle Joel to play that mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doing in my old home . We got up with the chickens and nobody raised a call on the way to the fields and it was seldom and seldom anyone gave out with a holler as they worked . Uncle Joel started out with a lively little tune and soon we wasp185all clapping ; Ned struck up a lyric and Annabelle got to cavorting . She was something to see there in the moonlight . She had n't combed her hair since I knowed her  --  Ada said she was too tenderheadedand sometimes my fingers itched to pull a comb through her hair and fix it up regular , corn rows or seed plaits , least put a bandanna over them kinks . But that night all them naps looked like curls and ringlets hanging about her face . She was light as a feather on her feet , her body supple as a willow and it was n't long before others joined in . The nights could be like velvet there , like another skin , it would be so warm and close . This was like times at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was glad to have something familiar insteadof sorrowing that the old times was gone . Something in me still listened for that banjo , but I was glad that I had lived to have such a time again and I sat there patting my foot . Harker asked me to dance , bowing to me , smiling . I had n't heard him the first time  --  he was standing off to one side of me and I was watching them dance off to the other . When I turned to him , he said , " Dansay ? " Something like that . I did n't understand the word but I knew what he wanted and I looked up , smiling , my heart beating fast . I 'd been acting like they acted , like it did n't make me no never mind that we did n't talk no more . But sometimes I 'd see him or Nathan or Cully about the yard or round to one of the outbuildings and my heart would about bust , I 'd want so bad to see them smile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harker told me then , and dropped down besideme where I was sitting there on the ground . " How many times you been asked to dance in French ? " This tickled me and he told me some more French . " Negro " meant black man ; " negress " was black woman ; " blank " was white . I laughed at that , thinking about Miz Lady . She could sure look like it was n't nothing shaking behindthat face . Harker had learnt these words down in N'Orleans , he told me . This was the way the black peoples spoke there ; they said it was some islands way out to sea , somewheres out from there , where black peoples had made theyselfs free . This was what they had talked about on the coffle and I asked Harker why we couldn'tp186go there , stead of West like he was always talking about , where it take so much of money to go . " Maybe , " he told me , " maybe there is some islands out there where black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange whites to get us there . Once we get on a boat which ai n't no sure thing  --  but once we get on the boat , we totally under the dependence of the whites . Or , say we make for the north ; probably Nathan , with the way he handle horses and all , and Cully , cause he young , could make a living , but me and the rest including you  --  we farmers . Land expensive in the north and things I know to do in the city ai n't zactly what the law allow . And I do n't have no white man to front for me this time , " he add , trying to make a joke . " There 's a lot of slavery between here and there . And if they catch us up there , they 'd just bring us back south . " I knew all this was true ; I had heard it before ; I had proved some of it myself . You could scape from a master , run away , but that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself how hard it was to find someplace to go . " No , Dessa , " he say , " I want to go West cause I knows for a fact it 's no slavery there . A black man told me that . He been there , come back from there ( and I never met no black man come back from these so-called islands ) . Slave catchers , neither patterrollers troubles no one there . But whichever way we goes , Dessa , going to take money . " It was like Harker was saying to me , here 's the plan I found to handle this problem , and finally , that night , I heard him . " Dessa , " he say , " Ada tell me you and the mis'ess do n't even much speak to each other . " I was n't foolish enough not to say something to her , and anytimeshe spoke to me I answered . But if she sat down outside , I 'd generally find something to do back at the House or down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said kind of careless like , " Slave do n't generally have too much to say to the master that I knows of . " " She ai n't your master . " " I knows that , but do she ? "  |p187Well  he sucked his teeth at me , which , though I do it myself , have always irritated me with other peoples . " What have she done you ? " Well , put like that , I could n't think of nothing right off and I got mad . " Why you taking her part ? " " It ai n't taking no one 's part to ask what causing trouble between two peoples . " " Why do n't you ask her ? " " She say you called her out her name . " Well , everybody knew that was true . " It fit her , " I said . I was tired of them acting like I was the main one in the wrong . " Nice white lady living out here , alone , amongst all these darkies . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I stiffen up right away ; I do n't like no man to cuss at me . " Dess , " he say and it was like he 'd never called my name before , just " Dess , " soft like that . " What going on here ? " He sounded about as hurt as me . I did n't know myself what was going on ; I just knew I did n't like it . " Walk out here with me a ways , " he say ; " I want to talk with you . " Was n't no privacy to speak of round that cabin , so we walked out towards the fishing hole a ways . We stopped in a little clearingthere in the woods and sat down on a log . We was quiet for a while . " You liking Nathan for your man now ? " he ask all of a sudden . His asking about me and Nathan surprised me so much that I laughed . Well as he knew us , Harker ought to knowed it had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Nathan was n't a fine-looking man  --  and I loved him . I had a powerful feeling for him , but as a brother ; he was like a brother to me . Then I got angry ; that was all they could think of when it come to a man and a woman : Somebody had to be lusting after somebody else . I had to be wanting Nathan for myself ; I could n't just be wanting him to have something better than I knew Miz Ruint was . " That 's all it come down to , huh ? " I ask Harker . " Somebody fumbling under somebody else 's clothes ? " " I did n't mean you no offense , but  --  You must be liking him for something . So why you want to lose him as a friend ? " I wasn'tp188specting this and I sort of turned away from him , but he kept right on talking and his words stayed on my mind . " Maybe he think you ought to be proud of him for doing something like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for the money , " and " All we know is she willing to do it . " " And what they going continue on to do ? " This was a sore with me , that Nathan could be loving up with her all the while he posed to be my friend . " I see this ai n't no sense thing with you , " Harker say then and I got mad . " Sense ? Why what he feel got to make more sense than what I 'm feeling ? You got all the sense in the world ? Is Nathan ? " " Dessa , Dessa , I did n't mean it that way . What I meant is , you feel about sense ' one way and he feel about it another ; and that 's that . And you-all going lose friendship over a white woman . " I did n't like it put that way , but still , " He seem like he willing , " I told him . " Who would you have gived Kaine up for if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ask that . " It 's like that , he feel like that for her ? " " Maybe ; I do n't know . Nathan can speak for hisself . But youallwo n't even talk to each others now . You know , I always did admire the way you-all was about each other . That 's why I went back with them to get you . At first I thought you was his woman , some kind of relation to him or Cully , they talked about you so . And I admired it even more when I found out you was n't . " I had n't knowed he felt this way about us . I 'd thought it was just the scaping , the idea of that that got his tention . Yet and still , " That mean I ca n't never say he wrong no more ? " " Dessa , you done said it . " " And he do n't care . " " Care about as much as you do . Dessa , what you-all got between you do n't give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was n't trying to pick Nathan 's womens , I told him . " If I was ,  |p189I  sho would find him a more likely one than her . " Harker just looked at me . " I be happy to talk to Nathan , anytime he want to talk to me , " I finally told him , " but Nathan , Cully , you  --  all youallseem like you do n't have nothing to say to me do n't have something to do with some white woman or this plan . " He did n't say nothing to that either . After a while , I said , " You know she wanted to see my scars ? " " I know , " he said . " Nathan told me . " You know they would sometimes make the slaves strip when they put them up for auction , stand them up naked , man or woman , for all to see . They did n't like to buy them with too many whipscars ; this was a sign of a bellious nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me she wanted to see them scars , that Miz Lady had to see the goods before she would buy the story . Nathan did n't urge me to do it , I give him that , but he , neither Harker understood what a low ' ration this was for me . Maybe , by her being a woman , they thought it should n't make me no difference ; I know they thought I placed too much dependence on it . And I held this against the white woman , too . " I know she ai n't the first person wanted to look under there , " Harker said real rough . Then he was gentle , trying to get me to see his point . " You ai n't the only one been hurt by slavery , Dessa . Everyone up in here have some pain they have to bear . Naw , Miz Lady did n't have no right to ask , but what is that compared to what she could 've done  --  and did n't do ? " He stopped , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you did n't have no business calling that woman out her name . We been trusting her all along , just like she been trusting us . How you going stop now ? " I muttered something about her trusting in her whiteness and not our blackness . That 's when he put his hand on my hands where I had em folded there in my lap . " Dess , " he say to me then , " I 'm glad you ai n't liking on Nathan cause I think you great myself . " Well this about took my breath away ; it was so long since anyonehad been so forward with me . And he said it like he knew just the way I wanted to be great and so was qualified to judge .
