The November election results confirmed what has long been one of the Administration 's greatest weaknesses : it has no substantial following among black Americans . Less than 10% of blacks cast votes for Ronald Reagan . Last week the Administration made an effort , of sorts , to bridge that breach on Martin Luther King Jr . ' s birthday . The President sat in for 25 minutes of an hourlong White House meeting between his Cabinet officials and a group of blacks , most of them conservative , who called themselves the Council for a Black Economic Agenda . They told Reagan what he wanted to hear : impoverished blacks , and whites as well , should rely less on Government and more on their own efforts to lift themselves out of their economic plight . <P> The little-known new group had asked for the White House meeting . Efforts by more traditional black organizations to talk seriously with the President have been rebuffed for the past three years . The council 's spokesman , Robert Woodson , is president of the National Center for Neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of quarreling with Administration plans to cut the budgets of programs aimed at helping the poor , the council suggested reforms , including tax incentives for development of poor neighborhoods and a shift from government- supervised foster-care programs for abandoned children to those of black churches and civic groups . " We did n't ask for special programs for blacks , " said Woodson . " That 's patronizing . " As for the absence of N.A.A.C.P. and National Urban League leaders from the meeting , Woodson contended , " Other groups say that all of our problems started with Ronald Reagan . They just recite the same old litany of despair . " <P> Reagan seemed to agree . In an interview with USA Today , he said some black leaders do n't talk about the positive things his Administration has done for blacks . Why ? " Maybe some of those leaders are protecting some rather good positions that they have , " he said , " and they can protect them better if they can keep their constituency aggrieved and believing that they have a legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not represented at the White House meeting , the National Urban League , issued a report last week on " The State of Black America 1985 , " which noted that blacks have been relying less on Government and more on their own efforts to cut down on crime and improve education . The league found reasons for " hope and encouragement " in its annual study , citing Jesse Jackson 's presidential candidacy and new efforts to end apartheid in South Africa . The report also found some signs of increasing stability in black households . Still , the report called Reagan 's record on black problems " deplorable . " The league 's president , John E. Jacob , singled out Reagan 's " continuing attacks against affirmative action " and " the unwarranted entry of the Justice Department into civil rights cases in an effort to turn back the clock . " Jacob contended that blacks , whose gains peaked in the 1970s , " have been sliding back " ever since . Example : black unemployment nationally remained at 16% , more than double that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worse off today than it is , is more of a testament to its traditional ability to survive than to anything else .
