In the eleven months since he was elected Austria 's President , Kurt Waldheim has become known as the " prisoner of the Vienna Hofburg . " Not that the former United Nations Secretary-General has been literally confined to the sumptuous gold-and-white quarters that serve as his office . But in the wake of revelations that for decades he concealed much of his record as an officer in the German army during World War II , Waldheim has not formally received even one foreign head of state or paid a single official visit abroad , duties that are the stock-in-trade of his largely ceremonial office . Last week , in the most damaging blow yet , the Reagan Administration barred Waldheim from traveling to the U.S. <P> While there is no definitive proof that the Austrian President committed war crimes , a Justice Department spokesman said the " evidence collected establishes a prima facie case that Kurt Waldheim assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of persons because of race , religion , national origin or political opinion . " For years Waldheim had left the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent most of the remaining war years finishing his studies . He later admitted he was a first lieutenant on the staff of German Group E in the Balkans from 1942 to 1945 . But he repeatedly denied he was aware of atrocities committed during the brutal German roundup of partisans in the Kozara region of Yugoslavia in the summer of 1942 . More than 60,000 people were sent to concentration camps during the campaign , and thousands died in the process . Investigators also believe that Waldheim participated in the deportation of Greek Jews to Nazi death camps in 1944 and helped turn over Allied prisoners to the German SS . <P> Accusations about these dark chapters in Waldheim 's past , based largely on material collected by the World Jewish Congress , began surfacing in 1985 . During last year 's presidential race in Austria , which Waldheim won with 54% of the vote , the U.S. came under intense pressure from Jewish groups to place Waldheim 's name on its " watch list " of some 40,000 suspected war criminals , convicts , deportees and others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian elections , Washington chose to conduct its own meticulous investigation , including the examination by a Justice Department team of previously unavailable records in the Yugoslav war archives . The probe gave careful scrutiny to material submitted on half a dozen occasions by Waldheim in his defense . In the end , the effort served only to turn up more incriminating evidence . Says a Justice Department official : " The more we checked , the worse it got . "
