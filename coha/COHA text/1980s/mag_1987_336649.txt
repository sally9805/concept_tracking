Young and eager , Bud Fox snares a $50,000-a-year job at a Wall Street investment bank . But he is not satisfied . Fox dreams of scoring the big trades . He gets his chance when he meets the wealthy corporate raider Gordon Gekko . " I 'm offering you rich , " says Gekko . Enticed , Fox takes off into the stratosphere of high finance , only to crash-land a year later . <P> A tale from last week ? Not quite . Fox is a character in Wall Street , a film directed by Oliver Stone ( Platoon ) and scheduled for December release that uncannily captures the real Wall Street 's current mood . Says Kenneth Lipper , a former partner at Salomon Brothers and the movie 's chief consultant : " There is a brooding omnipresence that the prosperity on Wall Street is headed toward a cataclysmic end . " Stone , however , downplays the parallels . " You see the shadow of the crash , but Wall Street is the story of an individual . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
