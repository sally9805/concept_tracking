Sleeping on the job is rarely productive , but in the control room of a nuclear power plant it can spell catastrophe . For that reason , officials of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took swift action last week . While investigating a tip , they learned that control-room operators and supervisors at the Peach Bottom nuclear plant near Delta , Pa. , have been regularly sleeping at the switch for at least the past five months . Calling the power station , which is 35 miles northeast of Baltimore , an " immediate threat to the public health and safety , " NRC officials ordered the plant shut down  --  the first such action taken by the agency because of operator deficiencies . <P> Philadelphia Electric runs two reactors at Peach Bottom , one of which had been shut down for refueling at the time of the NRC order . The utility now has to show why the plant should be allowed to go back on-line . A spokesman said the company is investigating the charges .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
