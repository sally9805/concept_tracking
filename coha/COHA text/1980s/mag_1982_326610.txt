Consumer Reports cuts back <P> <P> Since 1936 testers for Consumer Reports magazine have been pinching , poking and probing just about everything Americans buy . Each month the magazine issues tersely worded critiques of toasters , breakfast cereals , cars and other products . But now the publication is undergoing public testing of its own . Financial losses are growing and employee morale is shrinking at the magazine 's headquarters in Mount Vernon , N.Y . Making matters even worse , Consumer Reports has just lost its first libel case in more than 40 years of product testing . <P> These setbacks come as policy feuds within the organization have boiled into the open . In December more than 80% of 160 Newspaper Guild members signed a petition demanding the ouster of Rhoda H. Karpatkin as executive director of Consumers Union , the nonprofit publisher of the magazine . The protesters were incensed over what they considered Karpatkin 's shaky financial judgment . Their demand , however , was firmly rebuffed . <P> The guild petition reflected the division that has bedeviled Consumers Union for about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who want the organization to stick to evaluating products . On the other are the activists , who have pushed Consumers Union into new directions that include opening three public advocacy offices and launching Penny Power , a magazine aimed at elementary school children . The testers blame the expansions for much of the organization 's $5.7 million deficit . <P> Karpatkin , executive director since 1974 , insists that the new ventures are vital to Consumers Union . She attributes the financial plight to the state of the economy and a postal rate increase that will cost the magazine an additional $2 million per year . Says she : " The Reagan recession hit us , and our promotion results softened in the first part of the fiscal year . The second thing was a massive postal increase . " <P> Another heavy blow to Consumer Reports was the libel case . The verdict , which the organization is appealing , casts doubt on the magazine 's credibility . In the ruling , a federal court in Boston found that the periodical had " published a false statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity . " <P> The case involved the Bose 901 loudspeaker produced by Massachusetts-based Bose Corp . In a 1970 article , the magazine labeled the speaker inferior , saying that the sound of " individual instruments heard through the Bose system seemed to grow to gigantic proportions and tended to wander about the room . " Bose challenged the article and won $115,296 plus interest in damages . <P> To halt its financial losses , Consumers Union dismissed 10% of its 250 employees ; trimmed Consumer Reports ten pages from its average of 60 pages ; switched to cheaper paper and decreased the number of products sampled . It also told its advocacy offices to raise their own funds or close their doors . <P> Consumer Reports , though , is in no immediate danger of folding . It boasts a paid monthly circulation of 3 million , its highest level ever and an increase of nearly 11% over last year . The magazine , which has never accepted advertising , plans to stick to its basic format of reviewing six major types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue .
