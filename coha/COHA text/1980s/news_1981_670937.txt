I have a profound mistrust of pictures of impressive construction in distant cities of the world . This stems from a visit to Caracas in the 1950 ' s , and coincides with my first published opinion in this paper - a letter to the editor - while I was still a freelance writer . The letter was inspired by a favorable review of an exhibition of photographs of new architecture in Venezuela ; the buildings shown were a series of dramatic , high-rise towers of the most stylish modern design , dramatized even more by bold patterns of sun and shadow that highlighted the sophisticated slabs on a handsome Caracas hillside . This was new public housing , and it was meant to be the answer to the favelas , those shanties of cardboard and corrugated iron that housed the poor on another Caracas hillside. // The buildings , which I had just seen in the flesh - or more accurately , in the concrete and full , livid color ( the pictures were black and white ) - were appalling travesties of modern architecture and conspicuous failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so with a combination of fear and loathing and domestic inventiveness . I think the apocryphal stories of goats and crops in the bathtubs may have started there . My letter went on at some length about the shame of such architecture and the irony of its image . Its theme was a warning against the seductiveness of the architectural photographer ' s flattering abstractions , and their betrayal of reality , particularly in places as distant as Caracas , where the reality was not easy to check first hand. // I am still extremely wary of impressive presentations of new architecture in far-off places ; I bring along this reflex set of concerns about image , suitability and style , and the skills of propaganda . Therefore I approached the exhibition at the Urban Center ( 457 Madison Avenue ) called " America ' s Architecture for Export : New York ' s Contribution , " with caution . Presented by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects , which shares the north wing of the Villard Houses with the Municipal Art Society , the Architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 examples of work done by New York offices for those new architectural frontiers - the Middle and Far East and the Third World . It can be seen through July 15. // The firms have prepared their own panels of illustrations and text , and two of them , Skidmore , Owings and Merrill and Warner , Burns , Toan , Lunde , get the Huxtable broken compass award for type too small to read . The latter firm also gets the crooked T-square award for its absurd rationalization of the relationship of the new Rameses Hilton in Cairo ( I am not making up the name ) - a kind of offset tower of reincarnated brutalism - to the ancient monuments of Egypt . We are told that it uses " the ' wall ' as the overriding device . " True , most buildings have walls . And we can use a lot less of this kind of pretentious nonsense about " architectural recall " in the design of new buildings in old places so dear to the hearts of architects doing their own thing . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis for too many " hierarchicals " and similar buzz words for a generally thoughtful and sensitive housing and neighborhood development plan for Teheran. // None of these are modest projects ; and except for those in Iran , which were aborted by the revolution , the majority are complete or under construction . The most ambitious are master plans for new cities and communities , such as Conklin and Rossant ' s National Capital Center at Dodoma in Tanzania , which is to be the country ' s new capital , 350 miles inland from the old one on the seacoast at Dar es Salaam . The city is projected as a series of stepped , earth terraces , with staged construction of ministries , offices , shops and a hotel. // Construction for the United States Government is a traditional category of overseas work . Consulate staff housing in Hong Kong by Davis , Brody Associates suggests a handsome group of buildings on a steep slope facing the China Sea , and the new American Embassy complex in Moscow by Gruzen and Partners and Skidmore , Owings and Merrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red-brick embassy office building that bears a strong family resemblance to the Gruzen firm ' s New York City Police Headquarters . This centerpiece is surrounded by row housing for staff , and served by an American underworld of below-grade cafeteria , shops , health facilities and parking . Work began on this new , high-security community in 1979 and is scheduled for completion in 1984 , at a cost of $100-million. // The range of housing is broad , from the traditional efforts to develop economical and easily constructed housing systems for underdeveloped countries to standardized workers ' blocks for the oil companies . What is new is the size and ambitiousness of housing developments that utilize the conspicuous new resources of the Moslem world. // It is the commercial construction , however , that is the most spectacular , with the palm surely going to Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore , Owings and Merrill for his 27-story , triangular tower for the National Commercial Bank , which will soar over the flat landscape of Jiddah in Saudi Arabia . This extraordinary building has its facade broken only by large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s frame , an inward-turning scheme meant to protect the offices from heat and glare . The offices themselves , in the strictly opulent S.O.M. style , have their elegant seating arranged in the traditional Middle Eastern pattern of couches grouped around tables . The use of multiple small tables instead of one large table is the only noticeable departure from the ritual American corporate style. // The exterior of the bank tower is a powerful , sheer shaft faced in travertine . This amazing design is now being attacked and defended - as unsuitable in size , shape and scale for the flat , desert-city landscape , or as a brilliant adaptation of technology and art to a harsh climate and modern international business needs . There can be no debate about its inescapable monumentality. // The same firm , Skidmore , Owings and Merrill , has developed a fascinating airport for Jiddah . The King Abdul Aziz International Airport is covered by a series of huge , semi-conical , Teflon-coated Fiberglas fabric roofs . These lightweight , umbrella-like structures will protect an expected 950 , 000 airborne Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing could speak more eloquently of change. // There are a few outstanding foreign projects missing from the show - notably the prize-winning Parliament buildings for the Australian capital of Canberra by Mitchell-Giurgola ( but this project was exhibited earlier ) , and the ambitious redesign for the center of Teheran planned for the Shah by a Llewelyn Davies team headed by Jaquelin Robertson. // What strikes one most are the extremes of this work . At one end is a slender , teardrop-shaped , gold glass office tower with intricate reverse curves , designed for a development in Singapore called the Golden Mile , that is the epitome of suave , luxurious , high-tech commercial construction . At the other pole are 750 units of concrete block housing costing $7. 50 a square foot , erected in record time for the government of Cyprus to serve refugees from the 1974 Turkish invasion . The first is the work of Robert Sobel/Emery Roth and Sons , and the second is the Strovolos Community Low Cost Housing Development by David and Dikaios. // The change from earlier years of export building is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing , which was meant to adapt the simplest industrial tools or native processes to local needs , to the most advanced and stylistically sophisticated symbols of economic development . The difference is a response to the changing economics and politics of the Islamic countries and the Third World , including the inevitable desire for symbols of progress . Invariably , these building forms , styles and technologies are borrowed from the industrialized and business-oriented countries of the West . We are clearly still in the business of exporting architectural images. // Style has always been transported from one country to another . The British brought European classicism to India with the Empire ; prefabricated 19th-century iron gingerbread was shipped around the Horn . Some very strange buildings have been dropped into some very exotic places , with varying degrees of adaptive success. // I had a spooky feeling of familiarity with the Eggers Group ' s housing in Damman , Saudi Arabia - eight rigidly clustered groups of 17-story towers on podiums containing parking and shopping that looked like an update of Queens , for which 12 , 000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . That ' s exporting an image and a technology with a vengeance . The disembodied and discredited cliches keep right on rolling along. // Planners continue to try to sort out tidy samples of the populations of developing countries according to some magical set of demographic statistics , to be served by the right number of schools , playgrounds and regional shopping centers . And progress is still seen as steel and glass skyscrapers , no matter how inappropriate to culture , climate or site . As Jaquelin Robertson commented after his stint in Iran , " The export model we have been sending out is not working very well , and most of the world has a bad case of cultural indigestion. " // The client countries are , as usual , getting our best and our worst . If anything consistently marks this kind of export architecture , it is a failure of communication about means and needs . There is uncertainty and ambiguity on both sides . Beware of the pictures ; they always look good. <> <> //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
