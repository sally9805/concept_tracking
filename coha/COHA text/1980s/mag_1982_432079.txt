 | Richard Milhous Nixon married Patricia Ryan on June 21 , 1940 . It was a love match . They had met in 1938 at a community theater in Whittier , Calif. , where Pat was teaching high school and young Richard was practicing law after graduating from Duke University . Instantly smitten , he proposed that first night . Two years later they were wed in a Quaker service at the Mission Inn in Riverside , Calif . " Pat was very beautiful , " the former president says proudly . " She still is . She has the kind of classical beauty that lasts . " Pat Nixon is 70 ? but looks 20 years younger with her slender figure , fine-honed face , and curly darkblonde hair . Whatever effects she suffered from a stroke in 1976 have all but disappeared . " Her health is excellent , " Richard Nixon told me . " She does n't quite have the stamina she used to have , and she does n't like to go on faraway trips . But other than a slight , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one knows better than her husband what a remarkable woman Pat Nixon really is . As a young girl she did not have a life of ease . Her mother , born in Germany , died when Pat was 12 . For five years the young girl took care of her father , who died when Pat was only 17 , and her two brothers . After that she left California for New York , where she worked as an X-ray  | technician to earn the money to go back home to the University of Southern California . Working her way through school , she was graduated with honors . She worked after she married and while her husband was away in the Navy . The money she saved during his enlistment was used to finance his first political campaign in 1946 when he ran for Congress . " Pat and I come from similar backgrounds , " Richard Nixon replies when 1 ask him why he thinks their marriage has prevailed for 42 years . " We have compatibility and the same general beliefs . I married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence and great sense of humor . You know , " the former president continued , " she is still wonderful ; she has n't changed through the years . She has always been courageous and steadfast and has great strength of character . Her intelligence is very high . " I mention her cum laude honors at USC . " Yes , " he says , " she can discuss anything with anyone as an equal ? from a head of state on down . " Even though Pat does n't really care for social life , " the former president says , " she is an excellent hostess who does it all very well . She 's very good onstage , so to speak , even though she prefers not to be onstage . What she does n't like are vacuous dinner parties with a lot of idle chatter . " My wife 's most endearing quality , " Mr. Nixon says with feeling , " is her way with children . It 's difficult being the children of celebrities . Pat spent so much time with our two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection and warmth . But she was also a disciplinarian . She is the same wonderful way with our three grandchildren . ( Julie 's two : Jennie , four ; and Alexander Eisenhower , one and a half ; and Tricia 's son , Christopher Cox , three . ) Pat is their favorite . She makes up all kinds of games and plays them with the little ones , who are very far advanced and articulate , thanks to all that attention . My wife especially likes to play store with Jennie , Pat takes all her shoes out of the closet and Jennie will try them on and decide which pair to buy . Jennie has lots of fun and Pat does too . " Until recently when they moved to Saddle River , N.J. , a lovely little community less than an hour 's drive from New York City , the Nixons lived in a splendid town house on East 65 Street in Manhattan . Just when everyone thought they had settled down to New York City life , they sold the town house and bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I asked . You ? Or Pat ? " Both of us , " Nixon replied . " Of course , we both prefer the city and city life and we liked living close to Tricia and our son-in-law , Eddie Cox , who live there . But there was the privacy factor to consider . In New Jersey we have total privacy , a guarded estate , and great security . In New York there were tourists and people with cameras , and even buses . If we were not private people we would have stayed in the city . " Still , the Nixons get to the city quite often . The former president keeps an office in New York at Federal Plaza , a few minutes from Wall Street . " I get up at five o'clock in the morning , " he says . " I walk for half an hour , have breakfast , and drive into town . It takes me about 50 minutes . Pat drives in twice a week to see Tricia at her apartment . They lunch together and shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also comes in to have her hair done at Elizabeth Arden where she 's been going for fifteen years . " Every two weeks we go to Pennsylvania to see Julie and our son-in-law , David Eisenhower . It 's a two hour and twenty minute drive . We leave early Saturday morning , spend the night , and drive back to New Jersey the next day . " And is Julie still writing the book on her mother ? " Yes , it should be finished soon . She 's been working on it for two years . David 's writing a book too ? on his grandfather , President Eisenhower . His book is just about ready . He 's been working on it for five years . It will be the definitive biography , a great book , because David has access to material no one else has . " When the Nixons lived in California , at San Clemente , Pat used to spend her days working in her beautiful garden ? a quarter of an acre planted with roses and gardenias . In New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many different flowers ? she likes them all . Her greatest pleasure is reading and she will finish two or three books a.week , mostly novels and biographies . In her bedroom bookcase there is a varied collection ? it includes The Joy of Cooking , Mistresses of the White House , and the novels of Virginia Woolf . Pat watches very little television . Her husband , too , considers most television a waste of time ? except for ball games . In 1980 the Nixons spent their fortieth @# wedding anniversary in Europe , visiting Switzerland and then Germany , because Pat wanted to see her mother 's birthplace . Their forty-first anniversary was celebrated in their Manhattan town house with their family . This year they celebrated their forty-second anniversary in Florida . President Nixon says their closest friends are Mr. and Mrs. Jack Drown . whom they 've known since their Whittier days . Drown is a California magazine distributor . Pat and Mrs. Drown taught school together and they have been close for more than 40 years . " Our other close friends are Bebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bebe at his home on Ocean Reef , south of Miami . Every winter and summer we plan a trip somewhere . My trip to Marrakech ( Morocco ) earlier this year was a wonderful experience . It was everything Winston Churchill said it was . It was too far for Pat , though . But last winter we went to Jamaica to visit with financier John Rollins at his plantation , Rose Hill . The Nixons ' house in Saddle River is a two-story , 15-room redwoodand-fieldstone mansion set on four acres , with a swimming pool and tennis courts . I first visited the house on a wet and wintry night , but inside all was warm and cozy with fires roaring in the fireplaces and delicious hors d'oeuvres and drinks waiting . A smiling Pat Nixon looked wonderful in a long dress of printed chiffon lame with coral ribbons at the cuffs and hem . The former president wore a dinner jacket . " What would you like to drink ? " he asked me . " I make great martinis . I use a light gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a good shake . I know shaking is supposed to bruise martinis but it really doesn't. " 1 had a martini . He was right . It was perfect . In the past ten years the Nixons have had homes in San Clemente , Key Biscayne , Manhattan , and now Saddle River . Each house , says the former president , has held something special for his wife . " She has no favorite , " he says . " Just a favorite time of year to be there ? California in the summer , Key Biscayne in the winter , and New York and Saddle River in the spring and fall . " When the Nixons moved into the New Jersey house , they did n't have a stick of furniture . It had all been soldexcept for their bibelots and memorabilia ? with their Manhattan town house . Knowing they had to start from scratch to furnish the two-story house ( built 13 years ago by architect Elenore Pettersen , a student of Frank Lloyd Wright ) , the Nixons engaged interior designers John Cronin and Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling with French and Oriental touches .  | The big , red-lacquered family room , where drinks are served before dinner , is decorated in shades of red , brown , and beige and has a huge fieldstone fireplace . A beige-and-brown Moroccan rug covers an area of the Mexican terracotta tile floor . The enormous coffee table is covered in heavily textured white linen lacquered with a taupe glaze . When the pleated white linen shades are n't drawn , the floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the pool , tennis courts , and garden . Like every other room on the first floor , the family room opens to a stone terrace that surrounds the home . The night I was there , the Nixons served a delicious dinner ( smoked salmon , filet of beef , and an ice-cream bombe ) in their beautiful , rather formal dining room . Its carpet , made in India , is of a Chinese design . The table is Louis XVI , and the Chinese chairs are black lacquer . A Waterford-crystal chandelier hangs over this splendor , and brown ginger jars and Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinner is served on Danish porcelain , the wines in French crystal . My host comments on the Moselle ( " A fine wine , " he says ) given them by the president of West Germany as a fortieth wedding-anniversary present . Coffee is served in the living room , which is the color of ripe lemons or maybe daffodils . The same happy color is used in the Thai silk draperies . The rest of the room is done in spring-garden colors : pink , coral , lavender , and blue . The wall-to-wall carpet is off-white and celadon green . Beautifully displayed in the room are Pat Nixon 's collection of Boehm birds , jade , and Oriental objets d'art . There are intricately carved ivories and figures of porcelain , silver , ebony , and mother-of-pearl . A lovely miniature inlaid Korean chest was a gift from Mme. Syngman Rhee , wife of the late president of South Korea . A silver cachepot with a panther was a gift from the Shah of Iran . One of the most beautiful of the Nixons ' treasures from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads and framed in reflecting mirrors . So tiny are the stitches , the work had to be done under magnifying glasses . It was a present to Pat Nixon in 1976 from Chou En-lai . A Chinese landscape hanging in the foyer was given to Pat in 1953 by Mme. Chiang Kai-shek , who painted it herself . The former president keeps many of his treasures in his study , a handsome room lacquered a deep sapphire blue . Here , at a large French desk with a sapphire-colored top and ormolu mounts , he is writing his new book ? a massive work of personal reflections on the great leaders he has known since World War 11 : de Gaulle , Churchill , Adenauer , and Eisenhower . There is a big fieldstone fireplace in the study , too , a built-in ; blue-lacquered television set , off-white upholstered pieces , and blue-and-white linen draperies . The wall of blue lacquered bookcases is filled with hundreds of volumes and objects , including a collection of elephants fashioned of carved wood . When you enter the house , a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor and the master bedroom and four guest rooms . The master suite is decorated in Pat Nixon 's favorite colors : raspberry pink and celadon green . Here the wool carpeting is off-white with a small mintgreen diamond pattern . The draperies are pink-and-green flowered chintz . The headboard and bedspread are of the same chintz , quilted . All the furniture in the room is lovely : a little Louis XVI desk , a barrel-backed chair , a Louis XVI ivory painted and carved armchair , a small settee covered in silk moire ? the color of a raspberry souffle , a Louis XVI marble-topped dresser , and Louis XVI side tables . There are many photographs of the grandchildren . The lovely lamps are Chinese porcelain and celadon china with ivory string shades . The walls of the room are glazed a pale celadon . Pat Nixon s dressing room is carpeted in the same off-white and mint green as the master bedroom . The huge walk-in closets are mirrored and the cabinets are marble topped . The bathroom floor and basin are butterscotch marble , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shower curtain is gold chain mail . The former president 's beige bedroom is easy and comfortable : a beige wool carpet with a geometric design covers the floor ; the natural linen drapes are bordered in the same redflowered chintz that has been used in the bedspread . Over the walnut carved headboard is a snow scene painted by President Eisenhower . A second snow scene ? this one by Grandma Moses ? hangs in the hallway outside the bedroom door . Although he keeps a pad and pencil by his bedside table , he never works in this room . Sometimes in the middle of the night he will get up and go to his study to write and read . His dressing room has leather-and-brass walls and a tortoise-shell mosaic-tile floor . Prominently displayed are framed pictures of his mother , Hannah Milhous , at age 12 , of Tricia 's and Julie 's weddings ? and a photo of little Jennie Eisenhower , his first grandchild . The guest rooms are done in a burst of color . One is carpeted in confetti wool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The twin beds have special Cronin-Stempler designed headboards of violet basket-weave UltraSuede , and the spreads are violet and aqua . A second guest room is more subdued with wood paneling and shutters , multicolored Indian-cotton bedspreads , a builtin desk and TV set , and a deck chair covered in brown UltraSuede . The shelves here are used to store the grandchildren 's toys . Still another guest room ( the mos. vivid ) is carpeted in stripes of persimmon , pale blue , coral , lavender , and mint-green wool . The walls are apple green , the headboards are covered with forest-green UltraSuede , and the draperies and bedspreads are pink and forest-green cotton patterned with ribbons of flowers . T he Nixons ' kitchen is all moden and all electric with terra-cotta tile floors , rosewood cabinets , several refrigerators and freezers , a seven-burner stove , an open electric grill , various ovens , and a built-in butcher-block table next to the aluminum double sink . Adjoining the kitchen is a butler 's pantry and a laundry . Although the Nixons have a cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her husband says , " She 's a very good cook . " The breakfast area is done in cheery yellow and white with a pedestal table , white raffia chairs with yellow cushions , and a white wrought-iron chandelier . A little bleached maple high chair has been well used by the Nixon grandchildren . On rainy days the grandchildren play in the family game room in the basement level . It 's filled with tricycles , a hobby horse , a slide , a pool table , a Ping-Pong table , and bookcases for games and toys . Nearby is the extensive ( 1,000-bottle capacity ) wine cellar , wonderfully well stocked since President Nixon 's trip to France 's Chateaux country . He is a wine Collector and connoisseur . Off the cellar is the wine-tasting room , complete with table and chairs and a black wrought-iron chandelier with candles . The Nixons love their house and would rather entertain at home than dine out in a restaurant . If they do go out , it is to the houses and apartments of close friends like Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruwe . Nick Ruwe is Richard Nixon 's chief of staff . The former president is a man of such overwhelming vitality and life force that it is difficult to imagine his not dominating every situation . Even his enemies grant him mental magnetism , if not charisma . By the sheer strength of his personality he can easily take over a room . But still you always know that Pat Nixon is there . There is a quiet radiance about her . And warmth . And charm . In her very special way , she can take over a room too .
