Mr. Killian is not a judge , though lawmakers sometimes refer to him as Mr. Justice Killian . He works at the Congressional Research Service , an arm of the Library of Congress , where he is constantly updating an annotated edition of the Constitution. // Much of Mr. Killian ' s work is anonymous , and most of it never sees the light of day , since it takes the form of confidential memorandums to members of Congress . More than any one judge or law professor , he can influence Congress , for he tells lawmakers whether the laws they want to make are constitutional. // // ' A Historical Sense ' // // He is familiar with virtually all the major Supreme Court decisions of the last two centuries and is capable of citing cases from 1815 just as easily as cases decided in the last five years. // " I have a historical sense , " he said . " I like to follow the development of legal doctrine over time. " // Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier , a Wisconsin Democrat , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most respected and relied-upon individual " in the Library of Congress. // " Our confidence in him is partly due to his scholarship , " Mr. Kastenmeier said , " but also due to the objectivity and integrity of his work. " // Randall R. Rader , an aide to Senator Orrin G. Hatch , Republican of Utah , was also complimentary . As was Carey Parker , chief legislative assistant to Senator Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts : " We have a uniformly high opinion of Johnny ' s scholarship and his speed . He ' s quick and he ' s accurate . " <> <> Memorandums Are Often Cited // // Mr. Killian ' s memorandums are often cited by members of Congress arguing for or against a particular proposal. // For example , Congress this year considered a bill that would have prohibited discrimination in insurance on the basis of race , color , religion , sex or national origin . The bill would have affected existing contracts and would have been retroactive , but Mr. Killian concluded that it was constitutional under standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , indicate that " Federal legislation may impair the obligations of existing contracts when Congress deems it necessary and reasonable to do so in legislating for the general welfare with respect to broad generalized economic and social problems. " // But Mr. Killian does not always tell members of Congress what they want to hear , and he is not overly biased in favor of an expansive interpretation of Congressional power . <> <> The Separation of Powers // // He warned Congress in 1973 that there might be constitutional problems with giving an independent agency , the Federal Election Commission , law-enforcement powers normally exercised by the President and the Attorney General . For similar reasons involving the separation of powers , the Supreme Court later struck down provisions of the law that gave Congress the power to appoint members of the commission. // Mr. Killian also expressed the view , as early as 1978 , that the Constitution did not allow legislative vetoes , under which one or both houses of Congress block regulations adopted by Federal agencies . The Supreme Court later came to a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year Mr. Killian told Congress that it could not , by statute , give a President the power to veto specific items in bills . Presidents have always approved or rejected bills in their entirety . But in his effort to control Federal spending , President Reagan has sought authority to veto individual items in money bills , and he said he would renew his bid for such power in a second term. // " An item veto would enlarge the President ' s legislative role , " Mr. Killian said , and it would disrupt the balance of power between the President and Congress envisioned in the Constitution . The item veto , he said , would require a constitutional amendment . Mr. Reagan has proposed such an amendment , but some members of Congress have tried to achieve the same objective through legislation . <> <> Always an Issue Lurking // // Whether the subject is banking , insurance or pension law , Mr. Killian said , " there is always a constitutional issue " lurking in the background. // Congress recently passed , and President Reagan signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patented drug product , before the patent expires , for the purpose of developing and testing new drugs . Major pharmaceutical companies argued that this was an unconstitutional infringement on property rights inasmuch as there was no " just compensation. " // Mr. Killian concluded that the law was constitutional because it amounted to Government regulation of property , rather than a " taking " of property. // Laurence H. Tribe , a professor at the Harvard Law School , studied the issue at the request of certain drug companies and reached the opposite conclusion . Mr. Tribe said Mr. Killian ' s memorandum " betrays a quite shocking lack of constitutional sophistication and understanding , " an " almost embarrassing failure to grasp first principles . " But Congress passed the bill , accepting Mr. Killian ' s opinion on its constitutionality . <> <> A Native of North Carolina // // Johnny Killian was born 46 years ago in Waynesville , N.C. He has been working at the Library of Congress since 1963 , when he got a law degree from the University of North Carolina. // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except tax and securities cases , some of which he finds " incomprehensible . " He also skims the Congressional Record each day Congress is in session , and he takes a look at the weekly compilation of speeches and statements by the President. // The problem with such careful reading of so many court cases , he said , is that " it slows down my reading speed because I watch for all the hints between the lines . " To keep up his speed , he reads spy novels in his spare time. // Mr. Killian edited the seventh edition of the annotated Constitution , issued in 1973 , and he is now preparing the eighth edition , which will be published early next year . It is an authoritative but little-known volume that traces the development of constitutional law through Supreme Court decisions . The last edition covered 1 , 900 pages , of which 376 were devoted to the Bill of Rights. // " The Constitution , " Mr. Killian said , " was put together by fallible individuals . There were compromises on many issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very enduring , adaptable document. " // //
