Baby Love sits on the stoop , rolling the largest , fattest joint in the world . He wastes little : in go twigs , seeds , everything , until it seems as big as a torpedo . Other joints are tucked over each ear , and more are secreted in plastic bags under his hat . It is Friday night , the night to get high , get drunk and strut . Baby Love 's entire wrecking crew is here , sprawled over cars , squatting on the sidewalk , jiving . There is Shistang ( " He be cool with dice " ) , Little Spank , Gugu , Snake Eyes , Shilo , Spider Man , Daddy Rich , Little June , Snatch Pocket Earl and Snootchy Fingers . <P> " We be in the streets hangin ' out an ' gettin ' high , " says Baby Love . He is a very skinny , very small , very lethal 14-year-old . His eyes are slate gray , flashing to blue when he laughs . Mischief is etched across his face as a bittersweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mugger 's uniform : designer jeans , T shirt and $45 Pumas , the starched laces neatly untied . A wolf in expensive sneakers , Baby Love is a school dropout , one of more than 800,000 between the ages of 14 and 17 in the U.S. <P> Baby Love inhabits a world few white folks ever see , a Dickensian hell of cheap thrills , senseless deaths and almost unrelieved hopelessness . He lives in Brooklyn 's Bedford Stuyvesant section , one of the oldest black settlements in the U.S. Unlike the burned and ravaged South Bronx , ten miles to the north , Bedford Stuyvesant does not resemble a war zone ; most of its owner-occupied row houses , brownstones and churches are more or less intact . But high unemployment and a 60% dropout rate among black high school students make it a very dangerous place . One Bed-Stuy precinct , the 77th , has the highest murder rate in the city : 86 killings last year . <P> Baby Love is trapped . He can barely read or write , even though he would have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illiterate he could never hold even the meanest job for long . He has been running wild so long now that he may be beyond redemption . Ghetto children today are seduced much earlier by drugs and the street , some of them as young as eight or nine . That is the time they need help . Sinbad Lock wood , a Bed-Stuy street artist who tries to wean boys like Baby Love away from the streets to painting , says , " It be the parents ' fault , they gets rid of the kids by sending them to the candy store where they be buying reefer and beer . These kids ai n't no monsters-they be raising themselves , that 's all . " <P> Baby Love is almost always stoned . He rises late , plays basketball in the park or galactic-warfare games at the pinball arcade all day . If there is any money left over , he and Daddy Rich go to karate movies . He juggles four chicks with Casanova skill , and he makes enough from gambling and stealing to be a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
