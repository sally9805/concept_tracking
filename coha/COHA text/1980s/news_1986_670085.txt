WASHINGTON  --  A nearly $12 billion deficit-reduction package is caught in a struggle linking tax provisions for the proposed sale of Consolidated Rail Corp. with a House Democratic initiative to extend welfare coverage for poor families . The contest illustrates the complex , interlocking politics of the budget process this year . And as Congress pushes toward adjournment next week , the deficit package represents its last effort to show compliance with the Gramm-Rudman law ' s deficit target for fiscal 1987 . At stake in the Conrail provision is the tax treatment of depreciable assets owned by the railroad . The outcome of the dispute stands to affect the net value of the proposed sale . The House is proposing that new owners be allowed to depreciate the assets on the basis only of the sale price , while a Senate provision would give significantly greater tax benefits to the owners in order to make the property more attractive . The welfare proposal , implicitly linked to the Conrail sale in recent bargaining , has been a long-sought initiative by Democrats to extend coverage to low-income families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states currently provide this coverage , and advocates argue that the policy would serve to bolster families by no longer requiring that a mother be a single parent before receiving benefits . The proposal , which is opposed by the Reagan administration , wouldn ' t take effect until 1988 to prevent any impact on the deficit for fiscal 1987 , which began Oct. 1 . Within fiscal 1988 , the estimated federal cost is $115 million , and when fully in place in 1989 , the cost for the fiscal year is expected to be about $255 million . States , which share in financing Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits , would face additional costs of at least $290 annually by the same calculations . James Miller , White House budget director , weighed in yesterday with a letter suggesting " potentially adverse effects for the low-income populations . " But Democrats have an ally in John Cardinal O ' Connor , who asked the White House to intercede on behalf of what the New York archbishop described as a " pro-family " reform . The maneuvering is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional impact of the issue , particularly in the South . Senate Republicans accuse Democrats of jeopardizing the Conrail sale and trying to add new spending to a bill intended to narrow the deficit . House Democrats portray the choice as one between helping investment houses  --  which would handle a Conrail public stock offering  --  earn higher commissions or assisting poor families with two parents . Meanwhile , a House-Senate conference panel last night approved the final terms of a $100 million aid package for anti-Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua . The $100 million is incorporated in an omnibus appropriations bill funding most of the government through fiscal 1987 . As part of the same agreement , the conference approved an estimated $8. 1 billion for military construction accounts , including $97. 6 million for the Navy ' s plans to establish home ports in New York and Washington state . A short-term bill funding the government will expire at 12 : 01 a. m . EDT tomorrow . The House leadership is proposing an extension past the weekend , but the outlook for such a measure remains unclear . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , has threatened to veto any further short-term extensions . As a practical matter , however , the impact of an expiration is uncertain , given the long holiday weekend for federal workers . The Iceland meeting puts pressure on House Democrats to back away for now from any confrontation with the president on arms control . House negotiators last night sought to strike what agreements they could with the Senate in hopes of freeing the long-delayed defense-authorization bill . The hope was to give a semblance of progress and to buy time to pursue some resolution of the more controversial provisions relating to nuclear testing and adherence to ceilings under the unratified SALT II treaty . This strategy , advocated by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin ( D. , Wis. ) , reflects the institutional pressure on the authorizing committees to save their bills . But many arms-control advocates now expect the House to back down on the nuclear-test and SALT II provisions , making the real question whether a defense authorization bill will be allowed to emerge or will be further delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
