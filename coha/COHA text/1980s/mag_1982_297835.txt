Perhaps only a tribute to Singer Marian Anderson , 79 , could have brought together those operatic rivals Shirley Verrett , 50 , and Grace Bumbry , 45 , for a performance on the same stage . The first black person to sing with the Metropolitan Opera , Anderson has been inspiration and mentor to the two younger singers . Both , in fact , are Marian Anderson Scholarship winners . And so Verrett and Bumbry , who have occasionally flung verbal darts at each other , put aside their simmering feud long enough to participate in a rousing 80th-birthday tribute to Anderson last week at New York 's Carnegie Hall . Since the two women and Carnegie Hall are much in demand , the birthday celebration had to be held on a date that fit everyone 's schedule ; Anderson 's birthday is actually on Feb. 27 . No problem , said Anderson , adding , " It 's not everyone who gets to celebrate two birthdays in one year . " <P> The official dinner at the White House was given for visiting Egyptian President Hosni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal topic of discussion was china . " President Reagan , Mrs. Reagan , dear friends , " said the Egyptian leader , rising to propose a toast . " Before I start , I would like to first congratulate Mrs. Reagan for the new china , which is very elegant and very beautiful . " Mubarak , in his diplomatic way , was referring of course to Nancy Reagan 's celebrated $209,508 , 220-place , 4,372-piece set of Lenox china , paid for last year by the Maryland-based Knapp Foundation . Used for the first time last week , the new dinner service , with a raised presidential gold seal in the center of the plates and a red-and-gold lattice border , was accompanied by Morgantown crystal from the Kennedy White House and vermeil flatware purchased during the Monroe Administration . When one fretful guest reminded President Reagan of a Greek custom of breaking plates , Ronnie smiled , then said of such guests , " Well , they will either never be invited , or we 'll just use the old china . " <P> An overwhelmingly popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 , passed a milestone last week-her 30th anniversary as Queen of the United Kingdom and head of the Commonwealth . <P> The Queen celebrated her pearl jubilee in the company of her husband , Prince Philip , 60 , and her corgis , a breed Elizabeth made famous when she took to it in the days when she was a princess . Although she has outlasted all but ten British monarchs , Her Majesty is still 34 years shy of the mark set by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria ( 1837-1901 ) . If Elizabeth does set a new record , it will not be realized until the year 2014 . Heir Apparent Prince Charles , 33 , would then be 67.
