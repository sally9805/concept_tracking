coming . It is not the revolution of the young prophesied by Charles Reich nor is it a revolution of a class . It is a revolution that is still in its early stages but which will inexorably and inevitably succeed in changing the way we think and act . It is a revolution that was not started by the baby boom but which , in its most dramatic hour , will be entirely made by the baby boom . It is the revolution of the old . Of the three great population shifts since World War II  --  the baby boom , the baby bust and the aging of the population  --  two are complete . Only the third  --  the massive and continuing aging of the population  --  is continuing and building . Each day in America , the army of the old increases its ranks by an average of 1,400 as 5,000 people pass 65 and 3,600 die . In the next 50 years , the baby-boom ranks will march on into old age , bringing extraordinary change to that period of life , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail wind . When this century began , there were perhaps three million people in this country over 65 , or about four percent of the population . When the century closes , there will be 31 million people over 65 , comprising more than 12 percent of the population . And before the baby boom is finished , there will be 55 million people over 65 , and they will amount to 18 percent of the population . In that time , we shall rethink everything we know about what it means to be old in America . The baby boomers will be unlike any previous generation of elderly . They will change what has heretofore been the principal stereotype of old people  --  namely , that they are poor , uneducated and unemployed . The baby boomers will challenge and strain every existing program and institution concerned with the welfare of older persons . They may well force the rethinking of one of humanity 's oldest social contracts : the idea that the working generations will support the old and infirm . Today , there are 24 million elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the rest of the population . Since 1950 , the over-65 age group has doubled ; in the ' 70s alone it grew by one-fourth . Yet the most sweeping changes are still to come . Between 1980 and 2040 the number of Americans over 65 will more than double from 25 million to 55 million . We can make this forecast with reasonable certainty because all the people who will be over 65 in 2040 have already been born . This growth , however , will not come smoothly and gradually but in bumps and jolts . The future growth of the aged is in effect the continuing record of past fertility . The over-65 group will grow quickly by five million in the 1980s as those born in the 1920s begin to retire . After 1990 , the first baby boomers will begin turning 45 , and for the first time ever , there will be more Americans over 55 than in elementary and secondary schools . But then , as the small Depression-era groups arrive , growth of the over-65 group will slow sharply , adding only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , unless fertility increases drastically , the retired group could be the only age group left still growing in numbers and proportion . Beginning in 2011 , when the 1946 group turns 65 , America will see the most sweeping population changes since the 1950s . It will not Continued on following page be a baby boom but a sexagenarian boom . I n the 20 years from 2010 to 2030 , the numbers of elderly in the country will explode by a million a year . The overall increase of 20 million  --  or 59 percent  --  amounts to virtually a whole new generation of old Americans . And if these seem faraway events , they are not . The changes beginning in the triphammer year of 2011 will take place within the lifetime of more than half the Americans living today . Today , only one in every nine Americans is over 65 . In 2030 , more than one in every six people will be 65 or over . This change , due primarily to the small generation after the baby boom , means that the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramid with a large base in the younger age groups tapering to few numbers in the older ages will be stood on its head . The shrinking age groups at the bottom will be supporting an increasingly top-heavy load of older citizens . Because more people are living longer than ever before , the baby-boom generation should proceed into old age more intact than any previous generation ( barring the disasters of famine , pestilence and war that have too often been the human misfortune ) . Even if present life expectancy does not improve , seven out of every ten baby-boom men will live to 65 and eight out of ten women will make it to that age . And those who live that long can then expect to live another 14 years ( for men ) or 18 years ( for women ) . There is no reason to think that the baby boomers will be any more docile or malleable in old age than they have been in youth and adulthood . They will carry their special energy and character beyond 65 and alter all of our expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify old age as the most reactionary stage of life . The aged are often seen as the intransigent , cautious , fearful defenders of the old order . They are not risk takers . They are unwilling to change . But how many of these qualities are qualities of age itselfand how many are the result of the educational experience of the aged ? In America , a person 's age also tells you something about the time he was educated . Persons born in the first five years of this century , for example , were educated in the early ' 20s , when education was the privilege of the few . They completed an average of only 8.6 years of any schooling . Of the entire generation of Americans over 65 today , one-half have not completed a single year of high school . Only one-third of the current generation of elderly graduated from high school , only one in six had a single year in college and only one in ten holds a college degree . Higher education , moreover , was almost exclusive to men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ninety percent of them have graduated from high school . Of the men , 27 percent have at least a college degree ; of the women , 20 percent have college degrees . The differences in education between the generations have enormous implications for attitudes toward government , acceptance of authority , openness to change , voter participation , willingness to articulate complaints , and so on . The baby-boom generation will carry into its old age the social and political effects of its education . Around the time the first baby boomers have their 40th birthday in the late 1980s , they will he hit by two blows . The first is that the generation of their parents will begin to die . This was one of the most remarkable generations in American history . It was the Good Times Generation that survived the Depression , fought and won World War II and went on to build the most sustained prosperity the world has ever seen . When the boom 's parents die , they will take with them the living memories of all those events as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The death of the parents will also give the baby boomers a delayed authenticity crisis . For years they had defined themselves against the values of their parents . Now they will be pushing and there will be nothing to push against . At approximately the same time , the baby boomers will lose a generational connection on the other end . As parents , the baby boomers will see their children leave them with a longer " empty nest " period than any previous generation . This is because children are leaving home sooner than ever before and because parents are living longer after their children leave . Over the long run , the period of childbearing has been shortened about three years , on the average , and the period after the children leave has been increased by 11 years , thanks to the improvement in survival rates . Baby-boom couples can expect to live without children about 14 years longer than their parents , with most of the increase in their later years . Today , couples can anticipate spending about one-third of their total married life together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a different relationship to other cultures than today 's elderly . The grandparents of the boom generation have more foreign-born members than any other group . As recently as 1970 , one-third of all foreign-born persons in the United States were 65 or over . All the characteristics we associate with European-born grandparents  --  from their staunch patriotism to their lasagna  --  are now dying out with their generation . The coming generation of elderly , instead , will have stronger bonds to Latin America , as a result of the immigration of the ' 60s and ' 70s . The baby boom has always attracted investment , and there is no reason to think that the Gray Market , thought of today as stagnant , will not have a boom of its own . This means not just hospitals , nursing homes and trusses but a whole range of products and services that cater to the leisure-time spending habits of the elderly . New magazines have started announcing " The Joys of the Empty Continued on page 100 continued from page 23 Nest " for what will someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling ads for the first time and Retirement Living changed its name to the more spritely 50 Plus . Television also stands to gain from the wave of elderly people , who currently watch more than anyone else . Daytime television is in the process of switching its attention from younger women to older , retired people . It is not too hard to imagine the next generation , sitting moist-eyed in a media room as wired up and specialized as a kitchen , watching a 21st-century version of Lawrence Welk reprising the rock hits of the ' 50s and ' 60s for those who still remember . The opportunities offered by the baby-boom aged may be overshadowed in the long run , however , by the formidable burden this same generation will dump on the nation 's social services . A quantum increase in retired people will mean millions more in hospitals and in nursing homes and millions more dollars in taxes . Social Security is the economic backbone of the aged , but , even with 100 million workers presently contributing , the system can not hope to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby-boom elderly . Today the total federal , state and local tax bill amounts to about 33 percent of the gross national product-11 percent for social insurance programs like Medicare and 22 percent for other services . If the 22 percent for " other " services remains the same , and if the ratio of retirement benefits to wages remains the same , the total tax burden 50 years from now would have to grow 50 percent just to provide for the elderly baby boomers . When Social Security was first adopted in 1935 , the pay-as-you-go system seemed to work . Then there were ten workers for every person over 65 . Life expectancy was below 63 , two years under the retirement age . As long as the population grew larger , Social Security 's scheme could work : It would always be taking in more than it was paying out . Today , however , theratio of workers to beneficiaries has fallen drastically , while our expectations for the system have increased . Once they do retire , what will life be like for the baby boomers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live ? Will they command political power ? How will it be used ? These are difficult questions and , as we have seen , none of them can necessarily be answered by extrapolating from the behavior of present elderly Americans . At least one thing , though , seems certain . The boom generation will be increasingly female and increasingly alone . This is because a strange flip-flop of sex ratios has taken place within the space of the last generation . As with all previous generations , there were slightly more boy babies born during the boom years than girl babies . But because of the higher death rate of men throughout their lives , the proportion of women in each baby-boom group has increased each year . The last census in which men outnumbered women in America was 1940 . In 1980 , men still outnumbered women at every age up to 23 . But at every age older than 25 , women were in progressively larger majorities . The result is that the number of women over 65 is now growing twice as fast as men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more women than men over 65 . The female majority is even larger after 85 , an age that one of every three baby-boom women can hope to reach but fewer than one of every six men will see . The fate awaiting these elderly women is quite different from that instore for elderly men . Most men 65 and over are married and live with their wives . But most women over 65 are widowed and live alone . The reason is that men are less likely to outlive their wives , both because of their higher mortality and because they usually marry younger women . The fact is that , barring a sudden shift in life expectancy , the common experience of most baby-boom women will be the eventual loss of their husbands . What prospects do solitary older women have ? Women outnumber men in nursing homes two to one but , contrary to popular belief , relatively few actually live there . Instead , 80 percent of all health care given older persons is provided by adult daughters . Most older women have traditionally shopped around among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method will be harder for the baby-boom elderly . Many of them will be childless , or have no daughters , or will be estranged from their children by divorce , or will have children unable to care for them because of their own jobs . At least there are two consolations for the baby-boom women : They have more siblings to turn to for help , and they are more likely to have surviving children because of increased life expectancy . The inevitable conclusion , however , is that , in one form or another , the government will have to provide assistance for the baby-boom 's elderly , whether it be medical , financial , social or legal . We take it for granted that more and more people will live to see 70 in every generation . More people are living longer now because of the combined effects of better medicine , better hygiene and better diet . In Colonial America , with its high infant and maternal mortality , life expectancy at birth was barely 30 years . It had risen to 49 years by 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose steeply . In the first half of this century , life expectancy gained 19 years . Since 1950 , however , progress has slowed to only five years . For a man of 45 , life expectancy is now less than five years Continued on page 114 continued from page 100 greater than in 1900 . What is happening is that life expectancy is approaching life-span . This is an important distinction . Life expectancy is an estimate of the average number of additional years a person can expect to live , based on all age-specific death rates for a given year . It reflects infant mortality as well as adult mortality . Over the years , by eliminating many of the infectious diseases that have plagued children , we have greatly improved life expectancy at the younger years . But we have made less progress on the ailments that afflict the elderly : heart disease , strokes and cancer . Thus , while an individual 's chances of living from birth to 65 have been greatly improved , the chances of living beyond them have not improved so appreciably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological limit of the species . It has not changed measurably in human history . To improve the baby boom 's life expectancy now , we would have to attack the degenerative diseases that afflict the old . Of them , heart disease is by far the most serious . A 65-year-old person today has a 50-50 chance of dying from heart disease , which accounts for as many deaths in that age group as all other causes combined . The other way to increase life expectancy in the future will be to focus not on the disease-associated causes of death but to tinker with the underlying biological clock that causes aging . The generations that kept pediatricians busy in the ' 50s and ' 60s and psychiatrists busy in the ' 70s and ' 80s will eventually do the same for gerontologists . It is not inconceivable that their investigation of the underlying genetic and cellular mechanisms of old age could conceivably produce the very same sort of medical breakthrough for theand women are converging along with their working and living habits , some evidence is there that they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in three Americans with a drinking problem is a woman , compared to one in six a decade ago . Heart disease death rates are not falling faster for men than women . The suicide gap between men and women is narrowing . In 1963 , men were four times as likely to be involved in automobile accidents ; in 1977 , after the number of women drivers had doubled , the ratio had dropped in half . Perhaps the most ominous threat to baby-boom women is the increase in lung cancer blamed on cigarette smok-ing . The death rate of women from lung cancer has tripled since 1960 and will be up fivefold by 1983 when it will pass breast cancer as the leading killer of wom-en . There is no telling how high it may go . Smoking is rare in the current generation of 80-year-old women . But by the time the baby-boom women reach old age , the cumula-tive effects of their smok-ing could be devastating . Within the baby-boom generation , cigarette smoking has varied con-siderably , depending up-on how old each age group was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general 's reports , antismoking commercials on television and new to-bacco company ad cam-paigns aimed at women . Among the baby boomers born in 1950-56 , for example , one-half of the men and one-third of the wom-en were regular smokers by the time they entered their 20s . The next group of baby boomers , born in 1956-62 , smoked even more ; two-thirds were smoking ten or more cigarettes a day as teen-agers . This last group of baby-boom women , in fact , has become the first age group in which the women actually smoke more than the men . Since then , smoking has generally dropped in all young-er age groups ( though women still smoke more than men ) , suggesting that the baby-boom wornContinued on page 116 continued from page 114 en will remain on record as the heaviest smoking women ever . ( A factor not unrelated is that these same baby-boomers were the last adolescents to be exposed to television cigarette advertising , which went off the air January 2 , 1970 . As they look toward old age , these women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way , Baby , " have good reason to wonder what the destination would be . ) Between now and the end of the century , the baby boom will be preparing us for the reign of the old . With it will come what in many ways will be a restoration of the power and position of the elderly in society . It was not until the coming of the baby boom that we adopted the philosophy of ancient Sardinians who pushed their elders off cliffs when they were no longer useful . We did not destroy the elderly but just ignored them . Instead of following the aged as guides to the future , we followed the young . Inevitably , the hubris of youth is destined to decline . We will gain an elderly class that promises to be relatively healthier , better educated and more certain of its desires . We will almost certainly learn that all old people do not always live in nursing homes , are not all disabled , are not mentally defective and can lead full and satisfying lives . As we learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in dread . To be old may someday have all the possibilities of youth . If the baby-boom generation continues to promote innovation throughout its life cycle , if only to find solutions to the problems caused by its mass , we may wind up with an entirely different notion of what life is like after 65 . The distinction between " work " and " leisure " could break down as older people necessarily drift between part-time work and part-time retirement . Old age itself will become less clear an indicator of a person 's status . Our ideas about seniority will have to change if we expect to keep many older people in the labor market while still providing opportunities for the young . Retirement will be seen not as an end of life but simply another life stage . The old age bench mark of 65 may have to be scrapped . We might better think of a new and underutilized life stage called " old old , " the retired or relatively infirm whose role will conform more to our present stereotype of the elderly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become " not a society oriented toward youth but one oriented toward the young-old.
