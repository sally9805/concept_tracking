TIME 'S Pacific Board of Economists assesses the region 's future <P> In industry after industry , from textiles to steel , the leading edge of economic growth has moved from the once dominant U.S. and Western Europe to the fast-rising nations bordering the western Pacific . Since 1960 the gross national product of many Asian countries has grown , after adjusting for inflation , at an average annual pace of nearly 10% , more than twice the rate of the Western economies . To analyze the increasingly important role this region plays in the world economy , TIME has formed a Pacific Board of Economists , bringing together experts from four Asian states , Australia and the U.S. A report on the board 's inaugural meeting this month in Hong Kong : <P> <P> While economic performance around the Pacific rim remains the envy of the world , the global recession has helped drive down average growth in the major Asian nations from 6% in 1981 to about 4% this year . TIME 'S economists foresee a modest upswing for Asia beginning in 1983 ( see table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. , the single biggest Western market for Pacific exports , and Japan , an increasingly important customer for its neighbors . The U.S. 's G.N.P . has declined this year by about 2% , and even a modest rebound could dramatically help America 's trading partners . A big push is also needed from Japan , where production is now rising at a rate of only 2.5% . TIME 'S economists predict that America and Japan will pull out of their doldrums and help most Pacific nations achieve growth rates between 5% and 8% next year . Their views on some key economies : <P> JAPAN . For decades , export has been the engine of Japanese expansion . Domestic consumption has taken a back seat to investment in industries that could sell products overseas . Suddenly , the global slump has thrown that strategy into jeopardy . Japanese exports have fallen by 10% in the past year . " There are no more Japanese miracles , " said Board Member Saburo Okita of Japan , president of Tokyo 's International University , who explained that lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TIME 'S board suggested that the Japanese government should respond to the export shortfall by increasing spending to stimulate domestic consumption . Okita countered that such a course would be difficult because the government is already running a revenue deficit equal to 30% of its expenditures . <P> Board Member Peter Drysdale , executive director of the Australia-Japan Research Center at the Australian National University , maintained that with a current inflation rate of only 1.7% , Japan is in a uniquely strong position to adopt a stimulative policy . Said he : " Japan can be seen as a kind of excessively cautious giant at this time , hesitating to expand its economy for fear of rekindling inflation . " <P> Okita believes that Japan nonetheless will double its growth rate , to 5% , by the end of 1983-but only with an upturn in the sluggish Western economies . Said Okita : " Japan can not remain an island of prosperity in an ocean of recession . "
