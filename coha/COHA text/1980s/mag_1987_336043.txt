An old woman wearing a crown of green mountain ferns and drapery that looks vaguely Grecian stands alone , arms upraised , and chants in a strong voice to ancient gods . This is polite and also prudent . Kau'i Zuttermeister , 78 , is a hula dancer , and she accepts mainland Christianity , first brought to the Hawaiian Islands in 1820 by missionaries . But her uncle Sam Pua Haaheo , an elderly kahuna , or expert practitioner , who taught her the chants , dances and drumming patterns of traditional hula 60 years ago , told her to " pray first to the gods of your forefathers . They were here first . " <P> Some still endure . Most of the ancestor gods are gone now , but on the Big Island , the fire and volcano goddess Pele still lives . She is not worshiped , say modern-day Hawaiians , but she is acknowledged , and in the fiery and overflowing caldera of Kilauea she rules . The first hula , it is said , was chanted and danced in Pele 's praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 other splendid hula performers , the spiritual descendants of Hi'iaka , brought their art to the American Dance Festival in Durham , N.C. It was not modern dance , which is what the festival customarily explores and celebrates . But there were some similarities ; the hula is earth seeking , like most of modern dance , not aerial , like classical ballet . It is done with the knees flexed , and , of course , in bare feet . So , often , is modern dance . <P> When Zuttermeister was young , the ancient , traditional hula  --  hula kahiko  --  had nearly died out . Islanders with Hawaiian blood took little pride in their ancestry , and **28;9138;TOOLONG imitation hulas were staged mostly for tourists . But her husband Carl , a German immigrant , was proud of Kau'i 's Hawaiian blood and persuaded her to learn what her uncle had to teach . <P> A few others of that generation also learned from their elders , and by the early 1970s mainland ethnic-pride movements had strong echoes in the islands . Now there is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed on the chants and dance movements , exactly as she learned them , to her daughter Noenoelani Zuttermeister Lewis , 43 , and her granddaughter Hauolionalani Lewis , 20 . Public schools today teach hula as part of the cultural history of the islands . Teams taught by hula masters compete in hula dance-offs that are approximately as well attended as high school basketball tournaments in Indiana . Such top-ranked groups as the four who traveled to Durham have little chance to grow rusty . This week on the Big Island , for example , the Kanaka'ole sisters will invoke the gods for a space conference and take part in the Kilauea Dance Exhibition . <P> Noenoelani , kneeling , chants and finger taps the puniu , a small coconut- shell drum lashed to the thigh , and thumps the pahu hula , a larger sharkskin- covered drum . Hauolionalani , leis at wrists and ankles , head erect , chants a formal request  --  " Let me in , I 'm cold "  --  to be admitted to the halau , or dance school . Noenoelani replies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer is my voice . . . " Her daughter begins the rhythmic , liquid swaying of the hula.
