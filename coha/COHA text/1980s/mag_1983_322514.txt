A TV series finds the root of Chaplin 's gift in outtakes <P> For The Gold Rush he took a huge cast and crew into the high country near Truckee , Calif. , built a complete mining-town set , labored in the deep snow for weeks-and then used only a couple of shots from the location in the final film . He preferred to rebuild the town on his Hollywood back lot , where only his own caprices , not nature 's , could affect the process by which he achieved his most nearly perfect artistic vision . To shoot what seems to be a simple sequence , the meeting of his tramp character and Virginia Cherrill 's blind flower girl in City Lights , he spent 83 days , 62 of which were devoted to thinking the scene over while his company idled , on salary , waiting for genius to assert itself . Sometimes , as with a comedy called The Professor , he would start a film , complete whole sequences as masterly as anything he had ever done , and then simply junk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Spencer Chaplin , in his time the most beloved figure in film , perhaps in the world , and for all time the greatest master of screen comedy . He was also one of the century 's great celebrities and surely one of the most mysterious . Part faun , part satyr , he was avidly stalked , not just by gossips and journalists but by artistic , intellectual and political leaders fascinated by his movies . Yet he permitted only the briefest glimpses of his true self as he flitted through the thicket of myth and misinformation he deliberately created as a hiding place . Even his autobiography had almost nothing useful to say about how his genius functioned . It is an appropriate irony that the best record we shall probably ever have of Chaplin 's methods comes to us in a series of films derived from his own films . <P> Called Unknown Chaplin , it consists of three hour-long documentaries made for Britain 's Thames Television by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill , the team responsible for the best overall film history ever made , 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's film vaults by his widow , and to numberless outtakes from the pictures he made in 1916-17 for the Mutual Film Co. , which are now controlled by a silent-film collector-impresario , Raymond Rohauer . From hundreds of hours of this material , the pair has fashioned not only a priceless contribution to film history , but an essay that makes visible that most invisible of human endeavors , the creative process .
