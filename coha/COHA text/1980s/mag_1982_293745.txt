TV signs the N.F.L. to a spectacular contract <P> It is the fattest TV deal in history . Last week National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle presented to the annual meeting of owners a $2 billion television contract that goes beyond spectacular almost all the way to embarrassing . For the next five years , each of the 28 teams in the league will be compensated by ABC , NBC and CBS at an average of $14.2 million per season-up from about $5.8 million . <P> The new contract keeps cable television and other pay-TV systems away from any N.F.L. action for another five years . NBC and CBS have been raised from two preseason games to three . ABC gets an extra prime-time evening game and in 1985 joins in the Super Bowl network rotation . Last , but not peanuts , the networks have permission to sell another minute of advertising in all 243 games , making 24 commercial minutes per broadcast , at regular season rates estimated as high as $300,000 . <P> Large as the price was , the networks were as delighted about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple : men between 18 and 49 , the most desirable but hard-to-reach ad target . Last year 20 million of these men , in 45% of all homes with TV , tuned in the N.F.L. , according to a Simmons Market Research study . That is six times as many as watch even high-rated series like Dallas . College football , with half the male total , is the N.F.L. 's nearest TV competitor . And advertisers will pay almost anything to get in on this football pool . One TV industry expert estimates that $25 million of CBS Broadcast 's $300 million profit last year came from pro football . <P> For fans who may have thought that the big TV deal would lead to a break at the turnstiles , there is further financial news . Already , twelve teams-Dallas , Chicago , Green Bay , Minnesota , New Orleans , St. Louis , San Francisco , Cincinnati , Denver , Kansas City , the New York Giants and the Jets-have announced that they are raising ticket prices from an average of $10.50 to as much as $15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , the N.F.L. is now lobbying in Congress for exemption from the antitrust laws . This would open the way to further expansion . It would also tighten the league 's hold over such maverick owners as Al Davis , who is suing the N.F.L. for blocking his plan to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles . <P> The N.F.L. picture tube would seem to be totally bright . Even under the previous four-year deal , a club could hardly avoid making money . The owners of the Denver Broncos , for example , paid $30 million for the team in 1981 ; the new TV payments alone will more than cover the cost in three years . According to Ed Garvey , chief of the Players Association : " Under the current labor structure , a team could conceivably make a $4 million or $5 million profit next year without selling one ticket .
