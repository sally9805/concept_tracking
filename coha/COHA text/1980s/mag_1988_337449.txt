Braving a cold winter rain , about 2,000 young people packed East Berlin 's Evangelical Bartholomaus Church last week . The setting was a religious one , but the message was plainly political  --  a prayer service to honor some 20 East German dissidents jailed last month for disturbing the peace and having " treasonous contacts . " A few years ago , such a meeting would have been unthinkable in tightly controlled East Germany . But the glasnost breezes from Moscow seem to have emboldened a new generation to challenge the regime of Erich Honecker . <P> Last week Stephan Krawczyk , 32 , a popular antiestablishment folk singer , and his wife Freya Klier , 37 , a theater director , left the country rather than face charges of treasonable activities . The singer , once praised by the regime , had become an increasingly strident dissident . Krawczyk was arrested , along with about 120 others , following a Jan. 17 Communist Party rally in East Berlin during which protesters displayed banners calling for greater democracy . A poster quoted Rosa Luxemburg , a Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : FREEDOM IS ALWAYS THE FREEDOM FOR OTHERS TO THINK DIFFERENTLY . <P> Dissent in East Germany flows from a patchwork of diverse little groups whose aims sometimes conflict . Some seek immigration to the West ; others want to stay and press for greater civil liberties ; still others focus on environmental issues . The groups have received support and protection from East Germany 's Protestant churches , which have enjoyed improved relations with the regime since Honecker met with church leaders in 1978 . <P> Despite Moscow 's more lenient attitude toward criticism , the Honecker % government has tried to keep its youth under firm control by suppressing demonstrations and confiscating printing equipment . Leaders on both sides of the Berlin Wall are concerned over the growing ranks of those protesting the January arrests . Honecker , who has taken pains to show that his country is improving its human rights stance , wants to avoid hostile international publicity . West Germany , for its part , wants to preserve relatively friendly bilateral relations . East German Lawyer Wolfgang Vogel , an experienced East- West negotiator , met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State for Inner-German Affairs , to find a " humanitarian solution " to the growing crisis . Their discussions paved the way for Krawczyk , his family and another dissident to be escorted to West Germany . But , said Krawczyk last week , " we did not willingly leave . The alternatives we faced were either jail sentences of two to twelve years , or immediate emigration . We demand to be allowed to return to the German Democratic Republic . " <P> It is increasingly obvious , even to East Berlin authorities , that not all dissidents can be packed off to the West . Late last week , five more East German dissenters were released onto West German soil . According to Protestant church sources , two of them have permission to return to the G.D.R . after two years , while another two may keep their East German passports and citizenship .
