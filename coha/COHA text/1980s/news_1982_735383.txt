txt Before everyone sits down to watch the Major League All-Star game tonight , we 've got to get one big question cleared up : How do you like to take your world-class soccer  --  with commercials or without ? If you think it 's fun to have commercials arbitrarily plopped into the middle of a good soccer match , then you probably On Television loved ABC 's live broadcast Sunday of the World Cup finals between West Germany and Italy . If you do n't like to look at Budweiser and Seiko commercials in the middle of humanity 's biggest athletic contest , and you live in an area with a large Spanish-speaking population , you probably watched the game on a station that was carrying the Mexican broadcast of the match ( if you do n't have access to a Spanish-language station , you 're missing the world 's greatest soap operas ) . As a more or less professional viewer of television , I felt duty-bound to watch the big game in two languages . I watched ABC to see if the network would actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer game ( with a few exceptions , play never stops in a soccer match ) . Does ABC have that much gall ? Is Paolo Rossi Italian ? And when ABC was running its all-toofrequent commercials , my hot German blood ( 50% diluted with the blood of another nation that got beat early on ) would propel me out of my rocking chair to punch up the Spanish station on the cableTV console . Herewith , an assessment : ABC 's commercials were pretty obnoxious , but not so bad that they destroyed the game ( though there probably would have been 50,000 Italian-Americans outside ABC 's headquarters yesterday morning if ABC had been saying " This Bud 's for you " when Paolo Rossi was scoring goal number one for the Italian nation ) . There is some talk that the United States hopes to have the 1986 World Cup played in the U.S. , implying heavy U.S. network coverage and the possibility of large TV revenues for soccer . U.S. television has told every other major sport when to take a time-out for the commercials , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television or world soccer . ( Note to networks : Soccer has the only sports fans who actually kill people who do things they do n't like . ) Still , one has to admit that you miss things by watching the Spanish station . ABC 's Jim and commentator Paul Gardner had wonderful things to say : An Italian player named Gentile , which means " gentle , " is known as the " butcher of Turin " for his rough play . A German policeman is suing the German soccer federation because the team 's playing " nauseated him and made him sick . " The Italian team voted 18-4 not to talk to the Italian press . Jim 's best comment : " When last they won it , Benito Mussolini was the dictator of their country . " ( Personally , I much prefer Italian President Sandro Pertini , shown fastidiously buttoning the top button of a three-button suitcoat before raising his hands in joy . ) In any case , if ABC 's commercials drove you screaming into the kitchen ( for a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn Spanish .
