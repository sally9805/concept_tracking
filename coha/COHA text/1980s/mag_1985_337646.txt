Suddenly , Sudan seemed renewed . The change began with drum rolls and music on state-run Radio Omdurman , after which General Abdul Rahman Suwar al Dahab , the Defense Minister , proclaimed to the country , " The government is finished . The people stand united . " Within minutes , the capital city of Khartoum , which had been in a state of paralysis , sprang to life . Drivers honked their horns , radios blared , and hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets , cheering , chanting , dancing , embracing . Policemen smiled ; children , shouting , rode on the tops and trunks of cars . <P> Only hours earlier , Khartoum ( pop . 1.4 million ) had been a ghost town . Doctors , lawyers , engineers were on strike . The airport and most stores were closed . President Gaafar Nimeiri , the wily strongman who had weathered a succession of coup attempts during an almost 16-year reign , was outside the country . Now , with Nimeiri stranded in Egypt on his way back from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Suwar al Dahab and the Sudanese military . Some brandished the old yellow , green and blue-striped flag that had been replaced the year Nimeiri came to power ; others ripped down + pictures of the ousted leader ; still others held up currency bills with the former President 's face cut out of the middle . " For 16 years the real Sudanese people have been fighting this bloody regime , " shouted a man in the streets , his voice hoarse from yelling . " Today the power has been given back to the people . The people are demonstrating democracy . " <P> That , at least , was the intention . Last week , however , as the initial euphoria subsided and a new military council installed by Suwar al Dahab began to assert its power , a tangle of uncertainties remained . They were centered on Suwar al Dahab , the council 's head and a once trusted aide whom Nimeiri had appointed Supreme Commander of the armed forces just two weeks before his departure for Washington . Had the new leader organized the bloodless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military leadership against a takeover bid by younger , perhaps more radical officers ? Would he be as good as his word in returning Africa 's largest country to democracy after a transitional period of a year ? How , above all , would the soft-spoken and cautious Suwar al Dahab manage to tackle the crush of problems that had buried even Africa 's most hardened survivor ? Said one Western diplomat : " All the factors that overwhelmed Nimeiri  --  unrest in the south , a deteriorating economy , drought and a flood of refugees  --  may well overwhelm his successors .
