From the moment he rolled out of bed , Arthur Johnson found himself locked in silent combat with a sense of escalating dread . Over breakfast and as he walked to work through Brooklyn 's shattered Brownsville section , the power of positive thinking had kept the terror at bay : tonight he 'd be making his singing debut at Harlem 's Apollo Theater , and that was obviously something to worry about . But the venue should n't matter to a real pro , he told himself over and over . If a man hits the right notes in the shower , he can do the same thing in front of 1,500 people . Tonight was amateur night , his first public step on the road to fame . <P> At first , the strategy worked well enough . But then , as the subway rattled north toward Harlem , Arthur 's demons returned . Even above the racket of the wheels , he could hear them sniggering at his fantasies of stardom , playing good cop-bad cop with his head . One voice demanded to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff before the same footlights that had illuminated the talents of Ella Fitzgerald , Gladys Knight and Michael Jackson . A second and more kindly presence kept urging him to wriggle off the hook . The next stop would be his last chance to walk across the platform and jump the first train home . " Save yourself , " the voice said , reminding him yet again that the Wednesday crowd at the Apollo was the meanest , most capricious mob since the days of Nero 's circus and the Christian martyrs . Arthur refused to listen , finding within his 22-year-old heart a last , untapped reservoir of ambition to carry him out into the whirl of 125th Street . <P> Bright and unblinking , the marquee rose above the horizon of the subway staircase : TOMORROW 'S STARS TODAY  --  RALPH COOPER PRESENTS AMATEUR NIGHT AT THE APOLLO . Tomorrow 's stars ! He liked the sound of it . He pushed the stage- door buzzer and stepped into another world . <P> As Arthur followed the doorman 's directions down a maze of passageways to the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell in behind . It would have been hard to find two folks more different . Where Johnson looked like a jockey in an oversize sweater , New Arrival Steve Cruz was packed into a double-breasted , knife-sharp example of the dry cleaner 's art . Their attitudes too were poles apart . <P> " Whatever happens tonight , that 's fine with me , " Cruz remarked while they were waiting . " Three hundred and sixty-five days of the year I 'm plain old Steve Cruz , the guy who drives his truck up to construction sites . But tonight I 'm going to be the One and Only Steve Cruz , Live at the Apollo . Winning would be nice , but being out there and singing , that 's good enough for me . " <P> For anyone with dreams not daubed in greasepaint , the Apollo 's peculiar magic can be a little hard to fathom . That night 's first-place winner  --  an honor determined solely by the applause  --  would pocket just $200 . And , of course , there is that infamous Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who give no quarter . Ella Fitzgerald 's hazing is a legend . She managed no more than a few off-key notes before Master of Ceremonies Ralph Cooper came out to save her . Stilling the jeers , he won her a reprieve and she started again . On the second try , she brought down the house .
