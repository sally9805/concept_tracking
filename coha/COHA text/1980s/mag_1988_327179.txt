" Stand up to the challenge . Fight against overwhelming odds . Overcome the enemy . " The late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regularly exhorted his eldest daughter with such maxims . Benazir proved to be a keen listener . " In the stories my father had told us over and over again , " she writes in her new autobiography , Benazir Bhutto : Daughter of the East , " good always triumphed over evil . " <P> To Benazir Bhutto , last week 's national elections in Pakistan must have seemed the storybook fulfillment of her father 's fantasies . In the first truly free elections since the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq began his eleven years of autocratic rule , voters catapulted her Pakistan People 's Party to dominance in the nation 's politics and put Bhutto within reach of the prime- ministership once held by her beloved father . Dreams do come true . Scores do get settled . <P> The captured 92 of the parliament 's 237 seats , decisively beating the Islamic Democratic Alliance , its nearest competitor and the relic of Zia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote . The Alliance won only 55 seats . A surge of ethnic support thrust the fledgling Mohajir Qaumi Movement into the third and pivotal position with 13 seats . <P> Under Pakistan 's complex electoral system , more seats have yet to be decided , so a Bhutto government remains in doubt . By week 's end , odds were perhaps 50-50 . But the results are an unmistakable personal victory , whether she becomes Prime Minister or opposition leader . " The People 's Party has emerged as the single largest party , " she declared . " The acting President should now call on the People 's Party to form a government . " <P> Acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan is not bound to invite Bhutto to form a government . But it is hard to imagine his sidestepping her without unleashing a furious reaction . Bhutto handily won all three National Assembly seats she contested ( two of which will have to be filled in by-elections ) , and her party was carried to victory mainly on the strength of her blazing speeches and dazzling charisma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head held high and covered with a colorful dupatta , or scarf , this 35-year-old Western- educated wife and mother attracted frenzied adulation . To deny her the right to govern could just as easily turn those adoring crowds into mutinous mobs . <P> The President could still give the Alliance first crack at fashioning a governing coalition , but its two main leaders failed to win Assembly seats . Command of the Alliance was ceded to Mian Nawaz Sharif , chief minister of Punjab and a Zia protege , who won two seats . <P> Ishaq Khan hinted he would not automatically bypass Bhutto : " I think a woman Prime Minister might be a good change . " In the male-dominated Muslim society of Pakistan , it would be an astonishing one . That did not daunt Bhutto . She immediately set out to solicit coalition partners . By Thursday night she claimed , " We already have a simple majority in the parliament . " But Nawaz Sharif is also scrambling to assemble a majority , and likewise predicts he will succeed .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
