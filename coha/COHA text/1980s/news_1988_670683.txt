For more than a decade , however , unusual reddish-brown fish seen at hydrothermal vents have always been the ones that got away . Biologists diving in research submarines went after these fish with nets and baited traps . They even tried poisons . No luck. // Finally , on an expedition just completed , scientists captured one of the fish at a depth of 8 , 000 feet in the Pacific Ocean off the Galapagos Islands , brought it to the surface and identified it for the first time as a new species of the rare genus Bythites . Only one other fish , an eel-pout , has been recovered from these vents for laboratory analysis. // Since virtually all the other organisms to be examined from these exotic regions have been invertebrates , the new discovery is expected to broaden scientific understanding of an ecosystem sustained by chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis fueled by sunlight . Some scientists suggest that life on earth could have originated and evolved in conditions similar to those found at hydrothermal vents. // " These are very unusual and very important environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography . " Because there ' s life there , in waters that would normally be toxic to life , we need to study the physiology of these animals to learn how they have adapted , what makes it possible for them to live there. " // The captured fish was 12 inches long , with a relatively large head , a small mouth with teeth and a body that tapered off toward the tail . " It ' s a pretty ugly looking fish , " Ms. Boudrias said. // " It ' s shaped more like a large tadpole than anything else , " said Dr. Richard H. Rosenblatt , a professor of marine biology at Scripps , a division of the University of California at San Diego. // Dr. Rosenblatt and Dr. Dan Cohen , a specialist in deep-sea fishes at the Los Angeles County Museum , determined that the fish belonged to the Bythites genus . Only three other species of Bythites were previously known to exist , two of which were found in cold shallow waters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straits of Florida . Only five specimens of these three species have been recovered . <> <> Caught by a Submarine // The fish was captured on a dive of the research submarine Alvin , operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod . Ralph Hollis , chief pilot of the Alvin , snared the fish with a simple scoop net attached to the end of the vehicle ' s mechanical arm . His success this time , after so many failures on previous expeditions since the fish was first seen in 1977 , was attributed to improvements in the maneuverability of the hydraulic arm to more nearly duplicate the movements of a human elbow and wrist. // Operating the arm from inside Alvin , with Dr. Robert Hessler , a Scripps marine biologist , assisting , Mr. Hollis then transferred the fish from the net to a plastic container fixed to the submarine ' s exterior . The specimen container , about two feet square , is called the " coffin. " // As the Alvin ascended slowly from the sea floor , changes in the temperature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the fish ' s gas bladder , which controls it bouyancy , expanded and burst . Even lesser changes in pressure often have lethal effects on some animals without such bladders . But biologists have frequently brought up clams and crabs alive from the vents . <> <> An Empty Stomach // When biologists on the surface ship opened the container , they made one immediate discovery . The fish was female and had been pregnant . Under the stress of the pressure change , the fish had given birth prematurely to a multitude of fry , which were also dead . Like many deep-sea fish , including sharks , the vent fish are " live bearers . " Instead of laying eggs , they release tiny fish , usually enclosed in yolk sacs. // Working quickly , the scientists removed blood and tissue from around the gill on one side of the fish . The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for shipment back to laboratories . The other side of the fish was left intact for descriptive study by biologists and preservation in the fish collections at Scripps. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s stomach was empty . In previous observations , researchers noted that the fish seemed to spend most of their time with their noses nuzzled into the warm water vents , where temperatures can be several hundred degrees Fahrenheit . It was never clear what they ate . Since the fish were not attracted to baited traps , scientists suspected that they were not carnivores or scavengers like most fish but instead drew nutrients from surrounding micro-organisms . <> <> All But Invisible // Even though the empty stomach left the questions unanswered , Dr. Rosenblatt said the fish ' s teeth indicated that they were carnivorous . The reddish coloration , he said , could be the result of a heavy diet of crustaceans . Red is also a protective coloration in deep waters ; in the blue-green light , any red object appears black and all but invisible. // Ms. Boudrias said the place of these fish in the hydrothermal-vent environment has yet to be determined . Physiologists will be studying the specimen ' s blood chemistry and genetic material . Bacteriologists will search for any evidence of micro-organisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plentiful sulfides of the vent environment into oxygen to sustain the fish in a habitat where photosynthesis is not possible. // Other fish from other hydrothermal vents will have to be recovered if scientists are to solve another of the mysteries of these strange places . From all indications , scientists said , the vents have a lifespan of two or three decades , after which they apparently seal up and cut off the flow of water heated by molten rock deep in the earth ' s interior . It is not clear how life disperses from vent to vent and starts up again where a new crack appears in the deep sea floor. //
