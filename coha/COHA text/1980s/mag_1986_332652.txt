Last fall the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission abandoned the use of goals and timetables to remedy discrimination in U.S. employment practices . But EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas told Congress last week that his agency will resume its use of these antidiscrimination tools . The reason : the Supreme Court last month reaffirmed the legality of goals and timetables in the workplace . Said Thomas : " That 's the law of the land , whether I like it or not . " Civil rights leaders , however , are still wary that the EEOC will let employers drag their feet on meeting hiring goals . Ralph Neas , executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights , says Congress must watch the EEOC to be sure its enforcement activities are " real . "
