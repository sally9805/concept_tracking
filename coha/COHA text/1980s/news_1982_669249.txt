That was the title - provocative , if misleading - of a three-day conference held recently in Rhode Island by Brown University and the Providence Journal. // Not surprisingly , none of the formidable list of speakers put up a hand to answer , ' ' I will . ' ' It was , in fact , a stimulatingly wrong way to ask a most pressing question . It implied that some posse of shining personalities will ride in to save urban America . They won ' t . It also begged the question of whether the cities are in bad shape . They are . But it might have been fairer not to tilt the argument from the outset. // Nevertheless , the conference worked , raising issues that Bostonians and city dwellers everywhere must think through . Fortunately , the answers - as far as they went - were more exact than the question. // And they went pretty far . If you rearrange them to correspond to the major unasked questions , they look like this : // // * What ' s wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development , took the opening shot . ' ' The problems confronting our cities today are of tragic proportion , ' ' he told an audience packed into Brown ' s Sayles Hall , adding that ' ' we are going through a disappointing and painful stage of urban history . ' ' Thomas R. Donahue , secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO , provided some broad detail . ' ' In city after city , ' ' he said , ' ' business is disrupted because subways and buses are chronically breaking down . There aren ' t enough teachers ; there aren ' t enough policemen to keep city life safe. ' ' // Then the big-city mayors got specific . Detroit Mayor Coleman Young noted that 20 percent of his city ' s population is unemployed . Among blacks , the number is 35 percent . Among black youths , it ' s a chilling 70 percent . ' ' We haven ' t seen numbers like these since the 1930s , ' ' he said , adding that a soup-kitchen manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derelicts and street people , but whole families. // Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut III put the problems in financial perspective . Of his city ' s 475 bridges , he noted that 120 needed rebuilding . Of 1 , 500 miles of sewer , much was outdated . But where was the money ? The Indiana budget is staring at a projected $400 million deficit by next June . Moreover , he complained , Congress was trying to balance the federal budget on the backs of the cities. // // * What has caused the problems ? // The consensus answer was : ' ' Neglect . ' ' Mayor Hudnut pointed the finger at Washington , where , he said , ' ' there ' s a lack of awareness of what goes on in the cities of America . ' ' Mr. Donahue said he thought he knew why . ' ' So many of our national leaders , ' ' he said , ' ' have so little taste for city life and so little experience in city living. ' ' // For James W. Rouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace and Baltimore ' s Harborplace , the problem lies in neglected populations . ' ' We ' ve come to regard the people in the center of our cities as a burden rather than a resource , ' ' he said . These are the poor , who , in the words of Anthony Downs , a Brookings Institution senior fellow , have ' ' concentrated within large cities because they are systematically excluded from suburban and other newer areas . ' ' To Mr. Downs , what has been neglected is poverty - which , he said , is ' ' probably the single biggest cause of urban problems. ' ' // What has been lost , Mr. Donahue said , is ' ' our sense of community , the feeling of being a ' we ' as well as ' I ' and of having a personal stake in the civic enterprise . ' ' Washington Post columnist William Raspberry put it in different terms . Given what he called ' ' our national de-emphasis of the ideal ' ' and a ' ' shift toward a bottom-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' scrapping some of our most worthwhile values and ideals on the junk-heap of cost-effectiveness. ' ' // // * What are the solutions ? // Answers here were far more varied . Secretary Pierce , firmly within the **28;9735;TOOLONG school , predictably called for measures to revamp the national economy . Just as predictably , Mr. Downs dismissed the ' ' trickle down ' ' theory and called for specific programs aimed at joblessness . On the same tack , Mayor Young called for ' ' a soft public-works program ' ' modeled on President Roosevelt ' s New Deal. // For Mr. Rouse , the problems were already being solved . There is , he said , ' ' a surging new spirit in the old cities very different from anything that has existed in the last 50 years . ' ' For Harvard Prof. James Q. Wilson , the answer to urban crime lies in private initiatives . Police protection has become too bureaucratic , he said ; citizens themselves must take ' ' spontaneous and informal human control over public spaces ' ' that have been abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further study . ' ' If we made computers the way we do research on crime , ' ' he quipped , ' ' we ' d still be working with the abacus. ' ' // Mayor Hudnut took the same approach . Espousing the popular concept of public-private partnerships ( which he called ' ' the new civics of our time ' ' ) , he warned of a tendency to give them ' ' all of the responsibility and none of the authority. ' ' // At bottom , however , lay a consensus - sometimes implied , occasionally articulated - that what needed changing was not so much the policy of government as the attitude of the heart . Many big-city problems , said Mr. Downs , are ' ' rooted in individual behavior problems that are hard for public policies to influence. ' ' // How to get at them ? For Mr. Rouse , the answer lies in dwelling less on problems than on solutions . To ' ' contemplate the rational , working city , ' ' he said , would allow us to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' But it was Rev. Ralph Abernathy who said it most simply . ' ' We need something on the inside , ' ' he told an audience that later gave him a standing ovation , ' ' love and concern , crossing the racial barriers. ' ' // Good - as far as it went . But far underneath lies a question rarely articulated and hardly brushed by the nine speakers . It is this : **28;9765; Should <> our cities be saved ? // That is no merely rhetorical query . Those who care about cities must be aware that there are strong , if often unconscious , arguments in the negative . They run something like this : // Up through the 19th century , cities were necessary . Commerce required face-to-face contact ; industry demanded shoulder-to-shoulder cooperation . There needed to be forums for such activities , places where large numbers of people could congregate in relative security to add value to raw materials and sell the fruits of their labor. // But the city was not only for business , it was also home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the madding crowd and still work within it . Even those characters in Thomas Hardy ' s novels who walked for hours to get home from work were traveling distances that British Rail now traverses in a matter of minutes. // And because the city was both home and workplace , it naturally became the seat of culture , art , entertainment , and learning . It was the repository of the best that was known and thought of the old - and the laboratory out of which the new could arise. // Enter the automobile . Enter the highway ; the commuter belt ; the suburb , which for the first time in history provided the possibility of combining big-city working and rural living . Enter the telephone , with its potential for bolstering communication while reducing face-to-face contact . Enter television , spreading entertainment ( and capable of spreading culture and the arts ) far beyond a single stadium or proscenium. // And enter , at last , the home computer , spawning a new cottage industry of self-employed professionals ( writers , consultants , and financiers among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness as they like. // What good , these days , are cities ? // The answer , unequivocally , is : ' ' Very good indeed . ' ' But they will not appear to be so by those who live separated from the realities of human contact . That separation is a dangerous side effect of automobiles , telephones , televisions , and computers . They are wonderful things , in their ways . But each of them conspires to force its users into a secondhand world - moving alone down the highway , communicating over wires and taking culture in isolation. // Yet one has only to listen to a live concert , sit at a ball game , wander through a gallery - even hear conference speakers live rather than see them on videotape - to feel the intangible impact of firsthandedness . For we are , as Mr. Donahue said , ' ' a ' we ' as well as ' I. ' ' ' We are part of an us-ness , working best when we work together. // The danger to our cities ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public policy or private neglect . It lies in our acceptance of this secondhand view of life . Correct that - recognize the irreplaceable value of firsthand experience in a warm and peopled world - and we will have gone a long way toward saving our cities. // //
