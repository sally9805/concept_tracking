A dimpled 8-year-old makes the big leap to glitter city Rachel Combe , a self-assured 8-year-old with dimples who recently landed a part in the film version of " Annie , " made her acting debut two years ago in a second-grade Christmas play . With a twinkle in her big blue eyes , Rachel , who is neither shy nor modest , explained in a recent interview that her role as an elf who tickles Santa with a feather duster was " one of the biggest parts " in " Santa Claus , Wake Up . " From Holliston to Hollywood is a remarkable ascent . Shirley Temple made only a 10-mile leap from Santa Monica to glitter city . Rachel was among the more than 8000 young girls to audition for the Columbia Pictures ' and Rastar Productions ' movie , which will be filmed in New York and California , beginning this spring . The child , who studied a bit of ballet when she was 5 , but has never taken a singing or acting lesson , went to the Boston audition last July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen " Annie , " but knew the music from listening to and singing along with a tape her father had given to her . Her mother , Candace Combe , said : " We went in to Boston to have a fun day . Rachel wasn ' t nervous because we were really doing it just for fun . I thought they were looking for an older girl , somebody 12 who looks 9 . " " My mother says I was cool as a cucumber , " Rachel interjected . While the girls were in another room learning their lines or waiting to audition , Combe sat and talked with the other mothers waiting and keeping their fingers crossed for their daughters . " Amost everyone I talked to said their daughters had lots of singing and dancing experience . They ' d say , my daughter has performed at summer stock or my daughter is singing semiprofessionally . What has your daughter done ? ' I ' d say nothing . " Rachel was one of 40 girls asked to come back to the Copley Plaza the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Candace Combe , 30 , always knew that her " extremely outgoing " daughter had talent . When she was a baby , Rachel would sing in her crib . When she was 2 , she would act out the Wizard of Oz for any audience . Clowning around in her living room , Rachel sings and struts her way through a Drake commerical on television with the poise and spirit of Shirley Temple keeping up with Bill Robinson , tap for tap , in " Dimples . " But composure as a performer does not obliterate the childlike qualities . When asked if she ' d like to do a TV commercial , Rachel said : " I would like to do a Barbie doll commercial because I hear you get free stuff . " She was given a Barbie doll for Christmas and would like to add to the doll ' s wardrobe . The ability to perform is most likely a matrilineal trait . Rachel ' s mother danced Swan Lake as a 10-year-old on Community Auditions and won .

Later she gave piano lessons and would never refuse when asked to play at home . Singing and dancing were always part of the household when Candace Combe was growing up as the only daughter in a family with five sons . " My father loves to get up and sing . He would do Old Man River ' but ham it up , singing Old Man Eddie ' ( Edward is his first name ) and he used to sing Daddy ' s Little Girl ' to me . " The Combes almost had forgotten about the " Annie " audition until last Nov. 11 when they got a call from Hollywood . " Now Veteran ' s Day is my favorite holiday , " Rachel piped up . The Friday after Thanksgiving , Rachel and her mother boarded a DC10 for California . It was the little girl ' s first plane ride , and she was excited . Her mother was not as thrilled ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two up at the airport and took them to the Beverly Hilton Hotel , where for the next week Rachel and eight others tapped for further auditions . They spent most of the time reading scripts , singing , dancing and being coached in acting . Candace Combe , who grew up in Framingham , went to Boston College and was graduated from Framingham State , and the other mothers passed the time in sunny California sitting in the hotel lobby . Combe wished she had brought blue jeans or corduroys instead of what she considers " Boston-type clothes " like black pants , a black skirt and black pumps . " It was not our typical idea of Hollywood . It was very casual , no one put on airs at all . " For Combe , California culture-shock was the surroundings . She was impressed with the palm trees , warm-climate vegetation and the cleanliness of the city . For Rachel , it was the far-out getups and hairdo ' s .

Aileen Quinn , a 9- year-old from Yardley , Pa. had played a part in the Broadway production of " Annie , " and Lucie Stewart , 8 , of Ilford , Essex , England , had played Molly in the London stage version . Rachel Combe had acted in " Santa Claus Wake Up " in Holliston , Mass . Although it was originally planned that five of the nine would be chosen for the movie , which will be directed by John Huston , all nine were selected . Within days , Columbia Pictures is expected to contact one of the girls to tell her that she will play the lead role . The others will play orphans . Rachel would like to be Annie , although it means her brunette shoulder-length hair would have to be cut , permed and dyed red . " It would take me two years to grow it this long again , " she squealed . It is still uncertain what Rachel ' s part in " Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even commercials . Her mother will have to get the child an agent if she wants her to go further in the field . " I ' m concerned about her education . That ' s where it ' s at in the long run . She is a good student and I think she should be a nuclear physicist , " Combe said . " No , no , no , " said Rachel , whose favorite subjects are art , music , reading , math , recess and lunch if they don ' t serve fish sticks . Her mother continued : " She should take advantage of today ' s opportunity to do anything she wants . Girls have so many more choices than they did when all they could do was be a nurse , teacher or mother . " But Combe is not negative about Rachel ' s introduction to potential stardom .
