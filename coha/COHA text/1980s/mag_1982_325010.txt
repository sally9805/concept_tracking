THE DINING ROOM by A.R . Gurney Jr . <P> <P> Almost never does a U.S. playwright deal with bloodlines , class lines and cultural totems and taboos . That is what makes A.R . Gurney Jr . ' s drama something of a novelty . It is not a play , properly speaking , but a series of vignettes , almost like revue sketches , set in Northeastern Wasp territory , where the inhabitants go to Ivy League schools , often possess inherited wealth and hold their opinions in their obdurate spines . <P> The Dining Room might be subtitled The Decline of the Wasp , except that it is clear-eyed , touching and buoyantly funny . The stage set itself is something of an anachronism with its Sheraton table , Hepplewhite chairs and dour ancestral portraits . The time span is from the Depression to the present . The dining room used to be the site of unalterable tribal rites-Thanksgiving , Christmas , family fiscal confabulations . Now people eat in the kitchen . <P> Gurney uses the room as a kind of revolving door for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of disparate families as well as a feudal array of maids much given to the response " Yes , Missus . " In the first episode , a brother and sister who have inherited the house argue testily about which of them is to have the dining room . Subsequently , an architect advises a psychiatrist purchaser of the house to split the room up into his office and a reception area . <P> Two teen-age schoolgirls violate the sanctity of the room and go AWOL from their parents ' code by valiantly swigging a blend of gin , vodka and Fresca . In a duel of social proprieties , a daughter defies her mother 's edict that she attend a dance that will enhance her status in the Junior League and opts to attend a performance of Saint Joan with her spinster aunt . Still later , as an Amherst student photographs his aunt 's chinaware in the room , he tells her that he is doing an anthropology paper on " the eating habits of vanishing cultures " and that her crystal finger bowls symbolize " a neurotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of capitalism . " <P> In a six-person cast that is admirably flexible , Remak Ramsay is outstanding . He combines a ramrod to-the-manor-born stance with a tissue-thin vulnerability . This holds true through a variety of roles : a small boy who is devastated when a maid ( his surrogate mother ) tells him that she is leaving to start a family of her own ; a middle-aged man painfully humiliated by his teen-age son 's awareness of his liaison with his best friend 's wife ; an old man meticulously detailing his own funeral arrangements to his son while soliciting some final word or gesture of love from him . <P> Perhaps Ramsay is most formidable as a conservative autocrat of the breakfast table who tells his young son that the government is ruining the country . The boy replies that his teacher says the government should help people in Depression times . Fuming in anger , the father deliberately makes the boy late for school . Ramsay seems to embody the Wasps as Gurney critically and compassionately sees them-a breed whose manners calcified into morals while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalem
