Amid reports of dissension , a royal family learns to live with less <P> In the heat of a summer 's day , the highway curving across the desert from the port city of Jeddah to Mecca blurs into a shimmering ribbon of black . As the temperature climbs into the low hundreds , mishaps multiply : the blacktop is so hot that rubber tires explode and send cars swerving . No matter what the season , however , the same message greets travelers only a few miles outside the holiest of Muslim cities . Non-Muslims , the blue-and-white sign warns in English , must now leave the road . Only Muslims are allowed to visit Mecca ; others must take a circuitous detour around the city . Farther down the road , armed guards make sure that the stricture is observed . <P> The sign is a telling symbol of how cautiously Saudi Arabia deals with the outside world . Although its bountiful oil reserves and strategic location make Saudi Arabia vital to the West , the country can be exasperatingly difficult for a foreigner to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual : the past year 's drop in oil production has diminished Saudi Arabia 's income , while rumors of dissension within the ruling House of Saud have proliferated . <P> The country , of course , still shines with promise . As family businesses go , Saudi Arabia is immensely successful . Within a single generation , the ruling House of Saud has transformed its desert kingdom from a nomadic backwater into an influential power with all the trappings of a modern nation . Most of Saudi Arabia 's wealth , in fact , has been accumulated only in the past decade : with nearly a quarter of the world 's proven oil reserves , the kingdom profited handsomely when petroleum prices quadrupled in the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war . In 1981 , for example , the country collected an estimated $110 billion in oil revenues , up from $2.7 billion in 1971 . Government outlays rose accordingly : spending is now running about $80 billion a year . <P> As demand and oil prices have slipped , however , so have Saudi oil revenues . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $65 billion . For the first time in 20 years , Saudi Arabia will have a budget deficit , estimated at about $10 billion . <P> The effect is already being felt . Payments to foreign contractors are being deferred by 30 to 60 days . Instead of paying 20% in advance to construction firms , the Saudis are proffering only 10% . The biggest casualty so far is the country 's ambitious five-year development plan for 1980 to 1985 . Once budgeted at $250 billion , the program is way behind schedule , and no new projects are scheduled for 1984 . <P> Even so , most countries would be glad to have Saudi Arabia 's troubles . The Saudis still have an estimated $150 billion in monetary reserves invested abroad . Many Saudi officials , moreover , consider the slump a blessing of sorts , for it allows the country a chance to pause . Says a U.S. banker in the capital city of Riyadh : " The Saudis are not going to run out of money . But they are going to watch what they spend and begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
