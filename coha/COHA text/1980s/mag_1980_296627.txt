EBOLI <P> Directed by Francesco Rosi Screenplay by Francesco Rosi , Tonino Guerra , Raffaele La Capria <P> Exiled from Rome in 1935 by Mussolini 's Fascists , Carlo Levi , poet , painter , doctor and political dissident , was sent to a mountain village in Lucania in southern Italy . The book he wrote about this experience , Christ Stopped at Eboli , has become a small modern classic . If the film , which has been carved out of a much longer mini-series originally made for Italian television , does not have quite the stature of the book , it is nonetheless sober , virtuous and quietly absorbing . <P> The book took its title from the last train stop before Lucania , and the last outpost of the civilization that had nurtured Levi . The implication of the title is that despite the primitive religiosity of the culture that lay beyond Eboli , even the Saviour would have stopped before entering a realm " hedged in by custom and sorrow . . . without comfort or solace . " What Levi - played with patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucania is a drunken priest who is sometimes stoned by the village children , a bombastic mayor with the habit of summoning everyone to the town square to hear his empty Fascist orations , doctors whose medical skills are scarcely more advanced than the folk medicine the towns people practice . The hints of a modern world that manage to penetrate this fastness are so sketchy that they are bound to be distorted ; Levi sees how totally irrelevant the grand schemes of the modern state - and not only a totalitarian one - are to the real needs of these people . <P> No claim is made that Levi , in a relatively short stay , changed the lives of these people . More likely , they changed his , granting him a more humane and compassionate understanding of the richness of real life . That life goes on , time without end , below and beyond the political illusions that bemuse people with the education and leisure to indulge them . At the abstract level , Levi ( and his book 's cinematic interpreters ) seems to be saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistant it is to the forces of change , even when those forces are backed by coercive power . Forty-five years deeper into the 20th century , it would have been easy to romanticize the simple , patient people exemplifying that point . Rosi does not do it . He draws them with full dimensionality , verve and gentle irony . And with a sympathy that never veers into noble-peasant sentimentality . In this cut , Levi 's story seems to rush rather suddenly to a conclusion , but even so it is well worth attending . <P> - R.S.
