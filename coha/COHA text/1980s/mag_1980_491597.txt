With the 1980 presidential campaign already in full hue and cry , interest intensifies as to who will be nominated by each party . Challenges and counter-challenges are being hurled by all candidates as the pace quickens to a fever pitch . The old adage , " Timing is everything , " applies to campaigning as it does to all human endeavors . But , whose " time " is it , and can the winners be forecasted ? Ecclesiastes 3:1-2 states , " For everything its season , and for every activity under heaven its time : a time to be born and a time to die ; a time to plant and a time to uproot . . . . " Genesis 1:14 tells us , " And God said , let there be lights in the vault of heaven to separate day from night , and let them serve as signs both for festivals and for seasons and years . . .. " The moving , evolving universe mirrors these mysterious times and cycles in earthly events  --  as it is above , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasting human events , just as the Magi/wise men , or as in original texts , the astrologers/kings , could forecast when and where Jesus would be born and also knew to warn Joseph and Mary to flee the murderous intent of Herod . Our nativity charts are as individual as fingerprints , revealing the divine plan for each life . Astrology interprets these charts . It is not fatalistic but indicates the probable course of events , provided nothing is done to alter it . Constructive action can often escalate a favorable time into great achievement and forestall , or temper , adverse times . This is our " free will , " without which life would be purposeless , we would be puppets on strings . These times and events will show in a chart , although they can be misread , just as a doctor can misread x-rays , or a weather forecaster misinterpret weather fronts , overlooking something or not grasping its full significance . Forecasting life events can be accurate only if precise birth time is known . If the birth time is wrong , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article have been obtained from the best available sources . President James Carter was born October 1 , 1924 , at 6:42 a.m. in Plains , Georgia . He has a Libra sun and the sign of Libra was rising on the eastern horizon at Plains at his birth time , making him a " double Libra . " This is the sign of partnership and instinctive peacemakers , always striving to achieve balance . Such perpetual scale-balancing often leads to indecisiveness ( a trait observable in both Carter and President Eisenhower , also a Libran ) . Once a decision is reached , they can act resolutely and can even declare war , if necessary , to achieve peace . It can be a grave mistake to misinterpret their delayed action or wavering as timidity . Carter 's moon and Saturn in Scorpio give him a degree of incisiveness and a strong sense of responsibility ; he can care deeply about others . His Mercury opposing his Uranus can give him original concepts , though they could be impractical at times . Carter 's chart is powerfully aspected during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is not as favorable as it was four years ago . The convention time also is not as favorable as in 1976 . He faces an uphill battle to keep his office another term . Stressful patterns have been building up throughout his administration and will continue to do so . Pluto now on his eastern horizon shows peril from mob violence and fanatics , as the Iran situation has demonstrated . His progressed chart indicates a new beginning of some sort in November , and he will have to contend with formidable opponents , some open and some hidden . Senator Edward Kennedy , Carter 's opponent , was born at 3:58 a.m. , February 22 , 1932 , at Dorchester , Massachusetts . He has a Pisces sun and Virgo moon , and Capricorn rises on the eastern horizon . He has several unusual placements in his chart which can be troublesome for him . Natal Saturn falls below the horizon in the first sector of his chart and it has no major relationship to any of the other planets , sun or moon . Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Capricorn , but when unaspected , as here , this sense operates spasmodically and erratically , comparable to a loose string on a ten-stringed instrument . His moon falls in the same celestial longitude as Neptune and they are directly opposite his sun , making it difficult for him to be analytical or objective about his own emotions and actions . It can lead to unrealistic thinking . Kennedy 's planets form a see-saw pattern which creates inner conflict . He also has fortunate configurations which denote luck , fame and charisma . Kennedy also has a transiting Pluto effect . It is making a very difficult aspect to his natal and progressed planetary positions . This is another crisis point in his life . He also must cope with fanaticism and violence . Former governor John Connally was born at 2 a.m. on February 27 , 1917 , in Floresville , Texas . He has a Pisces sun and a Taurus moon , and Sagittarius rises . Mars exactly conjuct his sun illustrates his magnetic and forceful personality . His moon aspect to Saturn lends some conservatism and sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a maverick effect , accounting for his astonishing switch in parties . He can be full of surprises and have highly original solutions . Blunt-spoken Sagittarius rising accounts for his tendency to call a spade a spade and his capability to zero into the heart of things . It also bestows competitiveness , magnanimity and compassion . Connally 's chart also has very strong aspects to his mid-heaven and horizon , indicating status change . During the convention and November election , he can be much more formidable than anticipated . Republican candidate former governor Ronald Reagan was born on February 6 , 1911 , at 1:56 a.m. in Tampico , Illinois . He has an Aquarius sun and Taurus moon , and Scorpio rises , which combine to give him enormous stamina and youthful vitality . Five of his planets are in tenacious earth element signs , showing his deep conservatism . His Aquarius sun denotes advanced thinking , humanitarianism and innovative capability . He is endowed with keen financial acumen and charisma . Reagan should benefit from the timing of the Republican convention in July . In 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions occurred in August , not as favorable a time for him . There are very helpful configurations in Reagan 's chart now and his mid-heaven and rising degrees will be powerfully activated in November , indicative of a change in world status . The United States chart indicates many problems ahead . Inflation will remain troublesome , further atomic power problems and crippling strikes could occur , all reflecting in the stock market , but energy shortages will be the primary concern . There is grave indication of foreign entanglements , and another military police action is possible , similar to Vietnam or Korea . Oil shortages could compel such action to secure adequate supplies . There is potential for an unexpected , Iranian-type attack on our overseas military forces . April , May and June can be perilous months . These adverse foreign portents mark a low point for United States prestige and will have continuing repercussions , particularly in the political arena . Thus , for the Democrats , the law of diminishing returns applies , as the administration faces its toughest year . The party in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes . Foreign crises have escalated , and if Carter is unable to solve them , his reelection chances are slim . Carter 's chart indicates continuing peril , both politically and personally . After January 1 , 1980 , security precautions should be increased and his health guarded , as the physical drain can be seriously debilitating . His charisma and momentum of 1976 are dissipating and now resemble a sinking ship . Kennedy 's chart is also heavily afflicted ; security must not be slackened . He shares planetary weaknesses similar to Carter 's and lacks the formidable configurations his brother had in 1960 . His charisma and credence have been repeatedly battered by his own actions , tending to overshadow his favorable traits . There are so many unknowns at this time that there is no positive way of forecasting a winner now , but it appears neither Carter nor Kennedy can make it  --  they could be eliminated through the primaries , at the convention or by some incapacitating event . A compromise candidate is a possibility . As mentioned previously , constructive action can alter indications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark horse " could alter the election picture . Both Republican candidates can run strongly during the convention and November election ; both have much potential . At this time , Reagan appears to have the edge , but their individual efforts will be determining factors . The primaries can be crucial and a dark horse can not be discounted . Republicans should regain the White House . Nineteen eighty is shaping up as a year which will long be remembered . It is obvious great changes are ahead . How these changes will affect our future rests largely on both administration sagacity and public support . To paraphrase : Now is the time for all good citizens to come to the aid of their country . o do a proper job of calling an election an astrologer needs one- thing badly : accurately timed horoscopes on all of the candidates . For those readers who are accustomed to the " horoscopes " that appear in the newspapers , it may come as something of a shock to realize that a real horoscope is an accurate , schematic map of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the place of birth at the exact moment of birth . The date alone is not enough . We are limiting this discussion to four candidates who appear to be front runners at this early date : Carter and Kennedy , the Democrats , and Connally and Reagan , the Republicans . Of these we have truly accurate birth data only for Kennedy ! For Carter we have a birth time that is within an hour or so of correct  --  barely usable . For Connally and Reagan we have times that are in no way authenticated , and , even if correct , are clearly accurate only to within an hour or so . Everything that is said in this article is to be taken with the understanding that we are working with very deficient tools . An astrologer working with inaccurate birth data is like a carpenter using a rubber hammer . Astrologers use several systems when predicting . The first of these is simply to compare the planets ' positions on any given date to the positions in the birth horoscope . These are called transits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of real time for each year of life . These are called progressions . Another method is to consider each degree of arc to be equivalent to some amount of time . These are called directions . I have used all three of these in my work . In addition I have used the points in the zodiac halfway between pairs of planets as well as the planets themselves . These are called midpoints . I am currently a supporter of Kennedy , so that when I say that I do not think that Kennedy is going to be nominated , the reader will know that it is not because I am a Carter supporter or a Republican . His popularity will rise and fall several times between now and the convention , but by the time of the convention there will be very little energy leaning his way , astrologically speaking , whereas Carter has quite a bit going for him . It is in Kennedy 's progressions that we find the greatest difficulty . At the time of the convention he will have a combination of Mercury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun and Venus . Looking at each element we see Mercury representing communications , Pluto/power , Neptune/confusion , the sun/will , Venus/ability to attract people and the Mars-Saturn midpoint/blocked energies . In laymen 's terms , Kennedy is trying to communicate , to convince people that he is the best candidate , and he is trying to make people like him . However , he will be misunderstood , people will not be clear about what he stands for , and his energies will be blocked . This is a combination of misunderstanding , confusion , frustration and struggle . Certainly this is not an easy combination to live with when trying to win votes . Early in his campaign , the Iranians claimed that Kennedy tried to establish contact with the Ayatollah Khomeini to negotiate the release of the hostages . At the same time , he made his comments about the Shah , for which he was widely criticized . This kind of confusion and poor timing in his campaign is not likely to stop soon . On Election Day there are very few indications concerning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news . Carter , by contrast , is in quite good shape for the convention . In his progressed horoscope we find Mars with Jupiter , which indicates fortunate actions and good timing . We also find Venus connected to the midpoint of the moon and Pluto , which indicates one who is liked by the masses . Among his directions we find the Sun connected to the midpoint of Venus and Jupiter , which is another indication of being well-liked . But the strongest indication is that the planet Jupiter , the best indicator of success in general but especially in politics , is tied to Jupiter in his birth chart by a 90-degree angle . This is a combination which should energize Carter to success and achievement . However , by Election Day things will have changed significantly . The most severe indication is that in the progressed horoscope . Here we have Mars tied to Saturn in his natal chart , which in turn is tied to the midpoint of the sun and Mars . One of the best authorities in astrology , Reinhold Ebertin , states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verlag , Aalen , West Germany , 1972 ) , this combination means " difficulties or obstacles in vocation or profession , defeat in a fight or contest . . . . " In addition , near Election Day there is a combination forming of Mars with Neptune . This indicates weakness and inability to fight . It occurs near Carter 's combination of Mercury and Uranus . This indicates that he will find it harder and harder to get his point across to the American people . If Carter wins the election , it will not be by a landslide . He will either be very close or will lose . Turning to the Republican side , we enter the real bed of quicksand because of the birth time problem . At the time of the Republican convention , Reagan , whom most think to be in the lead now , does not seem to have much going for him . It is not so much that his chart is in bad shape as it is in no shape . However , if his birth time is considerably off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has excellent transits at the time of the convention , and could conceivably emerge the winner . But I do not have times on all of the other Republican candidates . Bush could be in contention . Connally 's most outstanding combination involves Jupiter 's midpoint with Pluto , the nodes of the moon ( a significant point on the moon 's orbit used by astrologers ) and the first point of Aries . This combination is described by Ebertin as " joint aspiration , a relationship to the masses , political activity ; a joint or shared success , far-reaching associations . " Near the time of the convention , Jupiter , the planet of success and achievement , crosses opposite his sun and Mars , a combination which makes a man 's actions very effective and usually well timed . If Connally is nominated , his chances on Election Day are also good . At that time he has Jupiter on the most elevated point in his chart , the mid-heaven , a point that has to do with career and success . However , if the birth time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be completely thrown off . So , from the data that I have received on these candidates , a Carter-Connally campaign looks possible , but that is without knowing much about Senator Baker , George Bush and Representative Anderson of Illinois . One factor could throw all of this off , aside from the birth time problem . In 1960 , Kennedy was elected under very bad combinations  --  so bad , in fact , that most astrologers thought he would lose . As a result of his being elected to the presidency , he was assassinated . I am not forecasting that a president is about to be assassinated . However , if historical events turn sufficiently grim , as they appear to be doing at this time , then winning a presidential election is not likely to be a good thing for whomever does it . Under these circumstances , difficult astrological signs rather than positive indications would forecast the winning of an election . Astrology really tells us most about psychological patterns in an individual 's life . It shows events only insofar as they are the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by the Constitution , not by the will of the candidates . Thus the astrological indications can only show probabilities based on the psychological states of the individuals involved , not fated certainties . he dark clouds on the international horizon for 1980 are an important factor in the race for the presidency of the United States , for a crisis in the international situation can erupt into action in April as Mars resumes forward motion . Any such development can favor the incumbent in office and thus President Carter , who is a major contestant in the presidential race . It is a curious thing but it is true that eclipses of the sun and moon have a way of picking out the important contenders for the presidency by occurring near their birthdays or six months away . Ronald Reagan was born February 6 , 1911 , so the solar eclipse of August 10 , 1980 , will oppose his natal sun . John Connally , another important Republican candidate , was born on February 27 , 1917 . The lunar eclipse , an appulse , of March 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eclipses are taking place in the signs Aquarius ( Reagan ) and Pisces ( Connally and Kennedy ) and in the opposite signs , Leo and Virgo . Senator Kennedy was born on February 22 , 1932 , and he will be affected by the solar eclipse of August 22 , 1979 , and the lunar one of August 25 , 1980 , each one being six months from his birthday . The eclipses will have an effect on all three of these men . On May 13 the sun will eclipse the planet Mercury , and on November 17 , right after the election , the sun will eclipse Uranus . These rare planetary eclipses pick out Senator Howard Baker , who was born November 15 , 1925 . President Carter is somewhat different as the incumbent in office . He will have the two giant planets , Jupiter and Saturn , on his birth sun in Libra at the end of 1980 , for he was born October 1 , 1924 . These two planets come together in this way every 20 years . Governor Brown of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in this manner . Other astrological indications are such that he is not expected by us to be a nominee or to win , even if he were selected as a nominee by the Democrats . The other candidate , of many whom we tried to consider , was George Bush , that capable Republican who was born June 12 , 1924 . While no unusual planetary combination picks him out , this does not entirely rule him out . Our problem was that his family was unable to recall the time of day of his birth , which handicaps any astrologer . We have , therefore , narrowed our choices to Baker , Connally and Reagan for the Republicans . They meet to select their nominee on July 14 in Detroit , Michigan . Which one is favored by the stars ? Ronald Reagan has been a major leader of the more conservative wing of the Republican party for many years and has a large following , therefore . Yet it is our opinion that he is not likely to win the nomination of his party . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For on the very day that the convention opens his progressed moon is in a difficult relationship to dour Saturn . The moon has much to do with the public and popularity . Indeed , on the day that the convention begins the moon is in Leo , the sign opposite Aquarius . This favors his opponents ' more than his own interests . If Reagan is not likely to win the nod from his party , what of John Connally ? Of the three types of zodiacal signs one is termed the mutable  --  **30;4110;TOOLONG . Connally has a heavy emphasis in those signs , his sun being in Pisces and his moon in Gemini . This emphasis on those signs that are so " mutable " accounts for his changeability , flexibility and versatility . After all , he was once a Democrat ! He has helpful planetary influences that are aiding him in his bid for power which accounts , for one thing , for the heavy financial backing he has received from Big Business . He could be nominated . Whether or not he is elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Senator Howard Baker has excellent planetary influences that can boost him . We are sure that 1980 will be a year of truly major changes for him . For Uranus , planet of the new and unexpected , is crossing his sun during 1980 . This can make him an entity that the solons of the party miscalculate . As a Scorpio he is a man of much depth and determination . He could be the best contender that they could put in the ring against the Democratic hopeful . It seems probable to us that the contest at the convention of the Democrats , which opens in New York on August 11 , will lie between Carter and Kennedy . And the struggle between them is likely to be a close one as both have good planetary factors working for them . The convention opens the day after a solar eclipse , an indication that it will be memorable . The moon is in Leo , as it will be for the Republicans , and then enters the sign Virgo opposite Senator Kennedy 's sun in Pisces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . We give the edge at the convention to President Carter . In addition , we find that he would do better in the election of November 4 than Kennedy would . If Kennedy were to run against Baker he would lose , and he might even do so were his opponent that other Pisces , Connally . Each year one casts a horoscope for the return of the sun on one 's birthday . This solar return chart of Kennedy is a very stressful one and is more so than is the case for Carter , thus auguring better for the President than his popular rival . Therefore , it is our view that Carter stands the best chance of winning over his opponent on Election Day as compared with any other Democrat . He is the sole candidate in either party who has the moon crossing his sun on the day of the election , which favors his interests . p ossibly the most significant presidential election of this century is right ahead , and it is hoped that the voting public will consider the serious nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consideration of the likelihood of a serious confrontation with foreign powers and continuance of economic problems should be uppermost in the minds of everyone who goes to the polls to vote . For the public to turn a national election into a popularity contest would be unforgivable . It is a time of stress , and the tension will be reflected at the polls November 4 . There may be a sudden switch of loyalties and a real struggle between the aspirants . After careful study of the planetary positions at the time of birth and their progression to the present for each potential candidate , it appears the Republicans could make a comeback . Ford 's chart is favored for the Republican convention and again on Election Day . Baker has very fine indications for success this fall , and even better in 1984 . There 's little doubt he will play a more important r.ole as the nation faces serious problems in the mid- ' 80s . Although we have no charts for Mr. Bush and Mr. Crane , both could be strong . Of the four potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two most dynamic appear to be Kennedy and Connally . True , Carter could be nominated , but could he win the election ? Kennedy 's chart shows the same kinds of problems ahead that are on schedule for the United States , especially in May-June 1983 and 1984 . Connally 's blueprint points to similar problems at the same time . Surely they are both going to be very active in the national scene at that time . It will probably be Connally versus Kennedy in November . Barring the strong possibility of another Republican candidate coming to the fore and taking over , it will be a real struggle between these two , with Kennedy pulling ahead on November 4 . This is the way it looks now . An experienced astrologer prefers to wait until the nominees have been selected before Continued on page 90 continued from page 63 trying to predict the winner . There are too many possibilities in this very crucial year . The stars incline , they do not impel . The electromagnetic fields to which life on earth responds are constantly changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually impossible . Born October 1 , 1924 , at approximately 6 a.m. in Plains , Georgia , Mr. Carter has the sun in Libra and the moon in Scorpio . Libra is called the peacemaker and is known for its sense of fairness and the ability to see both sides of a point of view . Carter 's moon in Scorpio reveals the depth and intensity of the feelings buried inside him , which inhibit and slow down action . The chart indicates a new beginning in January 1981 . Eclipses have an effect upon our lives . Just before the election , on October 23 , 1976 , a solar eclipse joined Saturn in Mr. Carter 's chart , warning of bitter disappointment in his term of office . A lunar eclipse in April 1977 set up another disappointment and then still another in October 1978 , when Carter struggled with the Israel-Egypt talks , which later bogged down . In March 1979 he experienced antagonism from the public when another eclipse troubled Mars in his chart . There was loss of popularity again in August . Another eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in August of this year . But in January 1981 , he will make a new beginning ! Two men competing for the highest office in the land could not be more different . Ted Kennedy was born on February 22 , 1932 , just past the full moon , which set up his self-justification motivation , as though he 's impelled to prove himself  --  to himself and to the world around him . There is the psychological need to project himself into the world and let it know there 's a good reason for his being aboard . His drive to accomplishment is derived more from his personal needs than from the need to please , which motivates Jimmy Carter . A solar eclipse will hit Kennedy 's chart the day before the Democratic convention . And a lunar eclipse later in August , the same one which will hit Mr. Carter , will affect Kennedy 's chart . It more than likely will stop one man and start the other . Kennedy has " lucky " aspects during the fall of 1980 and also in January 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most challenging and difficult years of his lifetime . The Republicans present us with another pair of men who are worlds apart . Ronald Reagan , an Aquarian with his moon in Taurus , is fixed in his temperament , inflexible in his views and quietly self-willed . He 's a very private man , one who needs constant reassurance , with all his apparent poise . The solar eclipse in February 1980 will tell the story . It 's very touch-and-go . Mr. Connally , born February 27 , 1917 , in Texas at around 2 a.m. , is the Piscean who changed his mind and suddenly decided to swim in the opposite direction . Resourceful , intuitive and flexible , Connally 's an adroit politician with a keen sense of timing . His chart indicates he 'd be likely to side-step confrontations with charm and humor . Which kind of man should we elect to guide us through the next few years ? P.S. The vice president will be very important this time . . . let 's be selective .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
