txt WHEN TILE Airline Deregulation Act was being sold to Congress in 1978 , its proponents promised it would reduce air ( swan They also noted that the only major passenger airline supporting the bill was Chicago-based United Airlines , the nation 's largest . United , many other airlines complained , would use deregulation to gobble , up its smaller competitors . IN THE YEAR and a half since the industry had its regulatory bonds loosened , however , not everything that was predicted has occurred . ? Airline , fares are up considerably . The one-way coach seat from Chicago to Kansas City that cost $58 Jan. 1 , 1978 , now costs $96 , 65 per cent more . ? United had difficulty recovering from its 58-day strike last year , losing nearly $100 million in 1979 and $46.9 million during the first three months of this year . ? The prime beneficiaries of deregulation appear to be the commuter airlines , which have continued to expand into markets the big airlines find impossible to serve profitably with jets . SINCE DEREGULATION became effective Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , W.Va. ? , Asheville , N.C. ; Chattanooga , Tenn. ; Merced , Modesto , Bakersfield , Visalia , and Stockton , Cal. ; Salem , Ore. ; and Muskegon , Mich. ? // Airlines Commuter lines main beneficiary // United also pulled out of Atlanta and New Orleans . In most of those smaller cities , United service was replaced by commuter airlines . The commuter airlines Industry grew by 18 per cent in 1979 , Civil Aeronautics Board officials said . In fact , the commuter airlines now carry about 40 per cent'of all air passengers ? on trips of 200 miles or less and 57 per cent of all passengers traveling less than ' 150 miles by air , CAB figures show . ? ON TILE SURFACE , it would appear as if the Airline Deregulation Act has been zlessAhan successful , but CAB Chairman liarvin S. Cohen said that is not true . Despite the steadily climbing regular airline fares , the special discount fares offered by the airlines resulted in savings of several billion dollars by air travelers , billion in 1978 , Cohen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , the half-fare coupons offered by United to lure its customers back after its strike last year and the airborne lottery it conducted for free round-trip tickets this spring would have been impossible under the old heavily regulated climate , airline officials said . About 21.8 per cent of United 's rev .. etiues came from discount fares in 1977 , the year before deregulation . Last year , revenue from discount fares accounted for nearly 35 per cent of the total . Rev-enues from full fares last year accounted ? " for about 41 per cent , down from 55 per cant in 1977 . " " EVEN THE STERNEST critics of deregulation have conceded that its first year ( 1978 ) was relatively successful . The airlines carried 274 million passengers and made a $1.2 billion profit doing it . The return on investment was a relatively heal* 13 per cent that year . ? Last year was a different matter , however . Despite carrying a record 316 mil ? lion passengers , the industry as a whole posted a profit of only $409,000 , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trade organization . " The trunks in the first quarter ( of 1980 ) posted net losses of a staggering 5250.5 million while the locals lost $19.4 million , " Cohen said . " While first-quarter losses are a common phenomenon in this iadustry , they come on the heels of heavy losses in the fourth quarter and precede that appears to be a substantial drop in traffic for the current year . " . THE MAJOR CULPRIT was a nearly 100 per cent jump in the price of jet fuel , CAB economists said . Fuel , which accounted for 16 per cent of the industry 's operating costs in 1978 , accounted for 30 per cent of the total in 1979 and has since . reached 34 per cent . ' United officials estimated that it cost that airline $20 million a year for every penny increase in the price of a gallon of fuel .

Although the CAB began bowing to preshsure in 1977 under former chairman John Robson , a Chicago lawyer , and started loosening its regulations , the 1978 Airline Deregulation . Act mandated changes in the way the industry could raise and lower fares as well as enter and pull out of routes . It also made it easier for new airlines to be certified by the CAB to increase competition . TILE STEADILY increasing price of jet fuel since the first oil crisis in the early 1970s made it inevitable that the trunk airlines , with big jets , would pull out of shorter routes , industry officials said . It was also more effective for the big airlines with high overhead costs to consolidate their operations . The average trip length for trunk airlines , less than 800 miles in 1974 , exceeded 854 miles last year , according to ' Air Transport Association figures . The trunks ( United , American , Delta , Eastern , Trans World , Continental , Western , and Northwest ) have increased the average by pulling out of shorter routes and adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller cities , for example , it added routes from Chicago to Florida , coming into competition with Eastern , Delta , and Northwest , and plans to add flights from Chicago to Houston , Phoenix , and Tucson . In Ft . Wayne , Ind. , United dropped its three daily flights to Chicago , but kept service to Denver . American added service between Chicago and both Dallas and Seattle in a market dominated by United . THE DEREGULATION ACT also al . lowed airlines to raise fares by 10 per cent and lower them by 70 per cent below standard coach fares . That has resulted in steadily increasing coach fares on some routes at the same time the airlines are slashing fares on highly competitive routes . That accounts for the fact that ? travelers could get a $99 budget fare from Chicago to Los Angeles in a market in which United , TWA , Continental , and American were fiercely competitive but had to pay $279 for a trip of approximately equal length to Seattle , a market dominated by United . The fares of commuter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many markets , also vary widely . A CAB survey of 187 monopoly commuter markets showed 41 per cent of the fares were either equal to or below the standard airline fare , 23 per cent ranged up to 15 per cent above the standard fare , and 12 per cent were nearly one-third higher . COlfEN BELIEVES deregulation should continue . " What we have done is create some risks , " he said . " But these are no different than exist in the private sector in general . " Deregulation is a two-way street . The public has already saved huge sums of money . Let us now give the industry a chance , " he added . Conventional wisdom among airline industry analysts is that the industry will continue to lose money during 1980 but that things should begin to look up by the ' end of the year .
