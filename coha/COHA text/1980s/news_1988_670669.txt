According to the civil complaint , Fred C. Lee , a Taiwanese citizen , illegally earned more than $19 million by trading stocks and stock options based on the information he bought from Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr. , the Morgan Stanley analyst . Mr. Wang was paid at least $200 , 000 for the information , the complaint said . <> <> Emergency Action // The S.E.C. filed the complaint in Federal District Court in Manhattan in what it called an emergency action to stop Mr. Lee , who is 38 , from transferring millions of dollars out of the United States . The S.E.C. also said its investigation was continuing , suggesting that others may have been involved with Mr. Lee and Mr. Wang. // No criminal charges had been filed , but several people with knowledge of the investigation said the United States Attorney in Manhattan was beginning an inquiry . A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney ' s office would not comment. // The S.E.C. said the illegal trading took place between July 1987 and April 1988 , long after Wall Street ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prison. // Morgan Stanley was an adviser in each of the proposed takeovers listed in the S.E.C. complaint . The prices of stock and stock options of the target company in a takeover attempt typically rise sharply once a bid is disclosed . It is illegal to trade securities using " material " non-public information about major corporate developments before it is disclosed. // The charges raise two troubling issues . The first is how a junior staff member could possess so much sensitive information , especially with the tightened security that most firms claim to have installed since the insider trading scandal erupted two years ago . Mr. Wang was scheduled to leave Morgan Stanley this week after completing a two-year term as a financial analyst , a position many Wall Street firms offer to people fresh from college . Second , many on Wall Street said that the charges , if true , demonstrated that even the widely publicized prosecution of Ivan F. Boesky and a host of other senior Wall Street investors had not put an end to the misuse of confidential information on corporate takeovers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits described in the S.E.C. complaint would make this the second-largest insider trading case uncovered , behind the more than $80 million earned illegally by Mr. Boesky . It took Mr. Boesky about five years to amass those profits. // Mr. Lee ' s attorney , Michael F. Perlis , was in Hong Kong yesterday and did not return calls to the San Francisco office of his firm , Pettit &; Martin. // Mr. Wang ' s attorney , Ira Lee Sorkin , said , " We ' ve read the complaint and we are studying the S.E.C. ' s allegations . " " Mr. Wang did not return calls to his office and did not return messages left at his Manhattan home. // In the case that broke open the insider trading scandal in May 1986 , Dennis B. Levine , a senior investment banker with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , was charged with earning $12. 6 million by trading illegally in 54 stocks over five years while at Drexel and Shearson Lehman Brothers. // The idea that Mr. Wang and Mr. Lee would engage in such an insider trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others stunned many on Wall Street and in the legal community. // " This was obviously a lot of trading in a short period of time , " said Gary Lynch , head of enforcement at the S.E.C. " At least two people didn ' t get the message " from the imprisonment of Mr. Boesky , Mr. Levine and their confederates , he said . <> <> More Problems Seen // Mr. Lynch said it was his sense that there was less insider trading in takeover stocks today than before the insider trading scandal broke , but that it was now increasing again . The run-up in stock prices before a takeover deal is announced is one sure sign of possible illegal trading. // " Those run-ups were minimal after Levine and Boesky , but it does seem that there are more now , " Mr. Lynch said . " And in two years from now there will be even more without big enforcement cases. " // Rudolph W. Giuliani , the United States Attorney in Manhattan , commented : " In these kinds of areas , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who think they can get away with it . What this argues for is a substantial and continued enforcement effort . " <> <> A Crucial Breakthrough // The S.E.C. court action yesterday was the latest step in a dramatic series of developments that began Friday in Hong Kong , where Mr. Lee was being questioned by S.E.C. lawyers. // According to court documents , Mr. Perlis , Mr. Lee ' s lawyer , appeared during a lunch break and said he had been authorized by Mr. Lee to say that Mr. Lee had lied during testimony in which he denied knowing Mr. Wang or using inside information . Mr. Perlis also told the S.E.C. about an additional stock in which there had been insider trading . Later , he informed the commission ' s lawyers that Mr. Lee was about to transfer money out of the United States. // Why Mr. Lee underwent a change of heart was not clear from the S.E.C. documents. // The S.E.C. said yesterday that it took the emergency court action to freeze the assets of Mr. Lee and Mr. Wang after Mr. Lee sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . Mr. Lee sought to move nearly $2 million from accounts at Morgan Stanley to Standard Chartered Bank in New York , where it was to have been credited to his Hong Kong account . Morgan Stanley did not execute the order and informed the S.E.C. Mr. Lee also apparently transferred $3 million from Charles Schwab &; Company to Standard Chartered. // Federal District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram granted the S.E.C. ' s motion for a temporary restraining order and the freeze. // Mr. Lee , who is also known as Chwan Hong Lee , maintains residences in Hong Kong , Taipei and McLean , Va. , the S.E.C. said . Mr. Wang lives in New York City , where he worked. // Mr. Lee described himself as an international businessman with interests in real estate , trading and public utilities , the S.E.C. said . Several people close to the investigation said his lawyer had told them Mr. Lee was from an immensely wealthy Taiwanese family. // The S.E.C. said that its evidence included telephone records showing that Mr. Lee had spoken to Mr. Wang before he made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in five instances Mr. Lee had traded in the shares of companies that a Morgan Stanley client had targeted for a takeover . But the clients eventually backed off without announcing a bid. // Among the 25 stocks in which the illegal trading allegedly took place were the shares of the Utah Power and Light Company , E. F. Hutton Group , the Stop and Shop Companies and Impact Systems Inc. // Mr. Wang , described as an intense person and a loner , learned of some of the takeovers because he worked on the deals . It is not known precisely how he learned of the others , but analysts at Morgan Stanley work in what is called a bullpen , a large open area where information is freely discussed. // Yesterday ' s civil charges were an acute embarrassment for Morgan Stanley , one of Wall Street ' s most prestigious firms and a leader in the mergers and acquisitions business . Morgan Stanley said that it was cooperating with the S.E.C. and that it had suspended Mr. Wang. // How Mr. Lee and Mr. Wang became acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts at Morgan Stanley for himself , family members , other people and several companies . The S.E.C. filings list accounts for 36 people or entities it was investigating. // According to people with knowledge of the investigation , Morgan Stanley ' s compliance department was studying Mr. Lee ' s accounts as early as last year. // Those sources said it was clear to Morgan Stanley officials that Mr. Lee was buying shares in companies shortly before takeover bids were announced , and that Morgan Stanley had a role in all of these. takeovers . But when Mr. Lee and his lawyer were questioned it was determined that Mr. Lee was just trying to play the takeover stocks as a speculator , the sources said. // At the same time , Gary S. Kaminsky , an S.E.C. lawyer , spotted unusual trading activity in the shares of E-II Holdings Inc. , a company involved in a takeover effort . In short order , the S.E.C. also received information from the New York Stock Exchange and other exchanges suggesting unusual trading in stocks just before takeover bids were announced. // Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One was that Mr. Lee was trading in the stocks . The other was that these were all deals in which Morgan Stanley had some role . The S.E.C. began its formal investigation on April 1. // Two weeks ago , the S.E.C. contacted Morgan Stanley and asked for a meeting . On June 20 Mr. Lynch told Morgan officials he thought there was a leak of inside information on takeovers from the firm . Mr. Lynch told them that Mr. Lee ' s accounts were being investigated , but Mr. Wang ' s name was not mentioned. // Last Wednesday night a subpoena for Mr. Wang arrived at Morgan Stanley ' s Manhattan headquarters . He had already left for the day , the sources said , and was not served until Thursday morning . Mr. Wang , the sources said , admitted that Mr. Lee proposed an insider trading scheme , but said he had rejected the approach . On Friday , Mr. Lee ' s stunning admissions in Hong Kong were reported to Morgan Stanley lawyers . Mr. Wang had stayed home from work , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer . <> <> Four Deals Detailed // In its complaint , the S.E.C. detailed four deals in which there was said to be insider trading. // Morgan Stanley was retained in July 1987 to represent the Public Service Company of New Mexico in a proposed bid for Utah Power and Light , the S.E.C. said. // On July 29 , Utah Power announced that it had received a takeover bid and its share price soared by $4 . From July 20 to July 28 , the S.E.C. said , Mr. Lee bought 210 , 000 shares of Utah Power . When its share price jumped on July 29 , Mr. Lee earned an $840 , 000 profit , the S.E.C. said. // The S.E.C. also said Mr. Lee had earned $1. 2 million trading in the stock of E.F. Hutton in November , just before the company announced it had been approached about a takeover . Morgan Stanley had represented the Commercial Credit Company , which had unsuccessful merger talks with Hutton. // Mr. Lee went on to earn $3 million in February by trading in the shares of Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kohlberg , Kravis , Roberts &; Company , a Morgan Stanley client. // In the case of Impact Systems , Morgan Stanley was hired in December by the Valmet Corporation to plan for a possible takeover bid . Mr. Lee bought 15 , 200 Impact Systems shares at that time . But no takeover bid materialized. // Following is a list of other stocks in which the S.E.C. said Mr. Lee had traded using inside information provided by Mr. Wang : // American Brands Inc .
