The package , as they say in Hollywood , looked great . Three top stars in the movie version of a Pulitzer prizewinning comedy that was also a long-running Broadway hit . A show that found sympathetic humor in incidents that scream like headlines from a Mississippi tabloid : MAMA MAGRATH HANGS SELF AND PET CAT ! LENNY MAGRATH 'S HORSE STRUCK DEAD BY LIGHTNING ! MEG MAGRATH VAMPS CRIPPLED EX-FLAME ! BABE MAGRATH BOTRELLE SHOOTS HUSBAND " ' CAUSE I DID N'T LIKE HIS LOOKS " ! A family album of three contentious sisters who laugh and fight and cry and finally surrender to the bond of sororal love . Directed for film by the guy who coaxed Robert Duvall to his Oscar in Tender Mercies . Ca n't miss . <P> But like many a Christmas package , Crimes of the Heart neglects to deliver the goods . Once a comedy , it has now become a sad-sack elegy . The events that Henley and her cast pumped life into on Broadway have lost their juice . What went wrong ? Is it that the intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colloquial bitchery ( " She was known all over Copiah County as cheap Christmas trash " ) , the climactic conciliations  --  all of which seemed fresh , if not downright impudent onstage  --  play smug and stilted on the big screen ? Or has something precious been lost ? When does a faithful , almost literal adaptation turn into a genteel lynching of its source ? <P> The stars are not to blame , though they are all about ten years older than their characters in the play . Diane Keaton is Lenny , the spinster with the shriveled ovary and a motherly protectiveness toward her younger sisters that too often expresses itself in shrill hectoring . Jessica Lange is Meg , the singer , free spirit and hot number , who has come home to suture the family wounds and relive an affair with her old beau Doc Porter ( nicely played by Lange 's real beau Sam Shepard ) . Sissy Spacek is Babe , under arrest for the attempted murder of her husband , who had discovered her frolicking with a black teenager . Spacek comes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile after a plethora of roles that forced her to bear down and save the world . <P> Smiles come hard , alas , when a property is treated with too much respect . Crimes of the Heart won a Pulitzer Prize , not a Nobel . But this kudos can be a curse . Once a play becomes the play , moviemakers like Bruce Beresford ( at best an unobtrusive director of human traffic without a natural camera style ) attach undue reverence to each line of dialogue . Nobody considers that words spoken in a theater may fall flat in a movie house without the ricochet rhythm provided by audience laughter ; everybody concerned tiptoes through the property as if it were the Victoria and Albert Museum . <P> And all surrender to the Hollywood Cast System . Roles played on Broadway by sharp actresses of minimum star wattage become brass rings for Oscar winners looking for the Next Big Thing . Though Crimes is an ensemble piece , the top gals inevitably compete for the dynamite scene and the revealing close-up . ( One wag suggested that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) So : good intentions , classy names , and what happens ? Crimes is ossified into a movie misdemeanor.
