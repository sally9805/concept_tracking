A strange defection in Kabul <P> Brandishing his AK-47 assault rifle , a 21-year-old Soviet soldier alighted from a taxi at the gate of the U.S. embassy compound in Kabul one morning last week , and was met by an American official who took him inside . Then , speaking only Russian laced with a smattering of German , he managed to tell surprised embassy officers that he wanted to defect . It was the first such move by any of the estimated 85,000 Soviet military personnel who have occupied the country since last winter 's invasion . Before long , the mysterious enlisted man had become the most prominent Soviet military defector since Lieut . Viktor Belenko flew his MiG-25 to Japan in 1976 . The defection sparked off an international row and added an unpredictable new irritant to already testy U.S.-Soviet relations . <P> Both the State Department and the Pentagon chose to play the issue down , partly because of lack of hard information . Although they believe that the soldier wants to defect to avoid punishment for insubordination , they are not certain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kabul embassy speaks either Russian or German and the would-be defector thus has not yet been fully interrogated . For their part , the Soviets insist that he is a common criminal escaping from military justice . They charge that he was lured into the compound . <P> Three days later , the State Department had finally managed to get a Russian-speaking American official into Kabul to debrief the defector , though it released no details . The embassy , meanwhile , had come under a mini-siege . First , the phone communications were cut off . Then squads of Afghan troops surrounded the compound . The apparent campaign of harassment spread to other Western embassies , where diplomats were searched and followed as they came and went . <P> Though U.S. diplomats were concerned that ultimately the Soviets just might arrest an American to set up a possible trade , or even that Afghan troops might storm the embassy , the matter seemed , so far , a standoff . It was obviously impossible to spirit the soldier out to the West . On the other hand , particularly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in no position to hand him back . One way out of the impasse seemed to be up to the Soviets : if they were to prove eager to clear the air for this week 's meeting between Secretary of State Edmund Muskie and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , for example , it was thought they might allow the hapless defector to go abroad-though not to the U.S. Otherwise , he was likely to remain in the embassy as an uninvited guest for the foreseeable future .
