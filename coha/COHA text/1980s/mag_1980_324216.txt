" Winter is icummen in , " Ezra Pound wrote . " Lhude sing God-damn . " And he bemoaned the season : " Skiddeth bus and sloppeth us . " Exhorted Pound : " Sing goddamm , sing goddamm , DAMM . " <P> So sing , Ethel , because we 've been standing here freezing for two hours . Thus ran the mood after the opening pieties of this somewhat dreamily organized chilblain derby , when those in the audience who had not thoughtfully arranged to travel by hot-air balloon had to foot it through the slush for the three miles back to town . Eight marchers were treated at the hospital for frostbite . The bus system had broken down earlier in the week because of a labor dispute , but now , after several days of practice , it was breaking down spontaneously , without need of a labor dispute . The hot-air balloons , on the other hand , worked just fine ; they bobbed overhead , all brave and fine and directionless , as Lord Killanin spoke wistfully in praise of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the first run of the luge , leaving hundreds of people standing on the pavement with cold water seeping into their shoes . The trouble is that Americans would sooner take hook worm medicine than a bus . The fact is that the buses know they are despised , and in their resentment they simply would not stop . <P> There are many bus-taking nations represented here - Austria , for example , where buses are contented and well behaved - but the Olympic delegations from these nations are made up of big shots who ride in limousines in their homelands , and they no longer know how to smile at a bus that has lowered its ears , pat its flank , and get it to open its doors . No one is quite sure where the buses go when they are not sulkily picking up people at the luge run , but there is no doubt that the ban on private cars has cleared the streets of traffic . State troopers standing in the intersections kick pebbles and talk about their vacations . What is in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people may also have cleared the Games of a good many spectators . <P> <P> Crowds at the venues have been sparse to medium ( " venue " in ordinary English is something you try to change if you face a richly deserved conviction in a court case , but in Olympspeak it is a place where an athletic contest is held ) . Even the men 's downhill , generally thought to be the most grandly lunatic of the Winter Games , drew less than a swarm . At the men 's 30-km cross-country venue , the American spectators would have fit around a poker table or two . ( Some 400 people rocked from one cold foot to the other , but most were Norwegian or Finnish officials. )
