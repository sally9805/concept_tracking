If you want a sneak preview of children ' s television shows for 1986 , do not delve into the imagination of the young , the dreams of the screenwriters or , heaven forfend , the hopes of the educators . Check out the annual toy fair . At the huge marketing zoo in New York this week , there is a menagerie of new toy creatures bearing names such as GoBots , Bumblions , Thundercats and She-Ra . Each of them is going to debut on television as well as the toy shelves . They will soon join the ranks of kiddie toy stars such as Masters of the Universe , Care Bears , Transformers and He-Man . In today ' s world , a " big toy " comes equipped with a TV series as if it were a battery . The manufacturers at the toy fair boast openly about television " back-up " and " support " for their new line . But they aren ' t just talking about 30-second television ads anymore . They are talking about 30-minute televison ads . Since 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on toys , the whole thing has escalated shamelessly . By next fall , it ' s likely that 20 of the Saturday morning shows , not to mention assorted mini-series , will be camouflaged , program-length commercials . Soon any product that doesn ' t have its own kid-vid promotion will have to be labeled : Cartoon Not Included . The trend gives new meaning to the expression " commercial televison . " In the good old days , we used to worry about television ads directed at kids . Now , children ' s television is an ad . The pitch is about as subtle as the remarks by Raymond McDonald , vice president of marketing for the Tonka Corp . : " You have to figure out how to capture a child ' s mind . They have to know just how to think about the product . " Tonka ' s notion of consumer education would never be tolerated in adult TV . Imagine a weekly adventure show in which things go better with Coke . Imagine a sitcom in which every shot of the heroine focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Cheers " were a Budweiser . " Would they be willing to turn all of television into a Sears Roebuck catalogue ? " asks Peggy Charren , head of Action for Children ' s Television ( ACT ) . " The difference is that adults will recognize they are being sold a bill of goods . Children won ' t . " ACT filed a suit with the Federal Communications Commission about made- for-toys TV . Their point was that children have enough trouble distinguishing commercials from programs . The commission had agreed earlier that " basic fairness requires that at least a clear separation be maintained . " Kids deserve more protection than adults , not less . Furthermore , if these shows are really just ads , ACT maintains that the stations aren ' t fulfilling their public-interest obligation to children ' s programming . These shows are not , by the way , any crummier than the rest of the Saturday morning lineup . " They don ' t cut up grandma and put her in the trunk , " Charren says . But they pervert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts it , " The advertisers in newspapers could write very nice articles for the paper which I might enjoy reading , but that ' s not what a newspaper is supposed to do . " There ' s a difference between editorial programming and vested-interest programming . Just how vested an interest is children ' s television ? Telepictures , which makes Thundercats , has offered to give the stations a piece of the profits from the sale of the toy . This cozy marketing notion is also at the FCC for rule-making . The FCC has promised to respond to the whole issue this spring . Even in the commission ' s current mode  --  pro-business , antiregulation  --  they should see something suspect in this two-team pursuit of the most gullible of viewers . It ' s too easy , rather like selling candy to a baby . That , by the way , is next on the kid-vid lineup . The first TV show to be created on the candy counter is now in production . It ' s " Gummi Bears " and it ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candies are cartoon bears who idealistically fight all sorts of evil in the world , except cavities . Each episode comes equipped with a very sweet ending for the advertiser . Illustration PHOTO <>
