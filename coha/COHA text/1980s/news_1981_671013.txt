Now the brothers Kalb , correspondents for NBC News , are back with another collaboration , " The Last Ambassador " ( Little-Brown ) , about the fall of Saigon in April 1975 . While there are sure to be attempts to match the characters in the book with the people who were actually in Saigon at the Communist takeover , the book is a novel complete with the usual disclaimer that the characters are products of the imagination. // The Kissinger book listed Marvin Kalb ' s name first on the title page , as did the novel " In the National Interest , " which he wrote with the television newsman Ted Koppel in 1977 . " The Last Ambassador " lists Bernard first . " That ' s only right , " said Marvin , the younger brother . " Bernie was able to feel and breathe and live Vietnam in a way I never was . I was in and out , but he lived there , knew the place , and in that sense this is really his book . When the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it ' s like to fly over the country into the highlands , that ' s Bernie Kalb 100 percent. " // Bernard Kalb , who lived for more than a decade in Southeast Asia , where three of his four daughters were born , acknowledged his contribution . " But things like the bureaucratic art of selfprotection in the face of disaster and official cover-ups all along the line , they are the perspectives of Marvin , who has been covering the State Department for almost 20 years. " // The brothers said that the book grew out of their long discussions about Vietnam over the years . " We talked it out at lunches , dinners , even in the corridor of our office , " Marvin Kalb said . " As we would talk , we would argue and compare ideas and write notes . We wrote out an outline of more than 100 pages , and what Bernie wrote went through my typewriter , and what I wrote went through his typewriter . Then Bernie ' s wife , Phyllis , took all the material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers originally planned to write a work of nonfiction , and they interviewed dozens of witnesses to those last turbulent days . But writing a detailed history while working as journalists presented problems , and so did the difficulty of writing current history . " It ' s sometimes terribly difficult to get three men who were in the same room at the same time to tell you the same story , " Marvin Kalb said . " Each person tends to glorify his own role and so to distort the role of others that it becomes nearly impossible to sort it all out satisfactorily . So we made a U-turn and incorporated our research into the novel. " // " We have a line in the preface to our Kissinger book , signed by both of us , in which we say that any errors in the book are my brother ' s , " Bernard Kalb said . " Now if people ask who really wrote this book , I ' ll wait to see if the reviews are great , and then I ' ll say I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beached in Wellfleet Harbor on Cape Cod . Stranded , it lay there dying , occasionally struggling and groaning , while a few bystanders formed a kind of wake . One of the bystanders was Stanley Kunitz , the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet . " Finally , on the next morning , while I was about one foot away from it , it opened its eyes and stared at me , " he said . " There was an act of recognition . Then it gave a great groan and died. " // Mr. Kunitz jotted a note in his workbook , in which he sets down occasional lines , phrases and metaphors . " For all those years I thought of it as a possibility for a poem I had to write , " he said , " but the narrative element was difficult to master . When Harvard asked me to read a poem during commencement week this year , I thought this was the time to write the poem . I worked on it all spring. " // Mr. Kunitz later read the work at Cambridge University . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whale , " a 150-line poem in five episodes , is scheduled for publication late this year or early next. // " Often that ' s the way things happen with poems . They simmer and simmer , and then they make the right connections , and suddenly they ' re alive and thrashing , " Mr. Kunitz said . " But it doesn ' t usually take 13 years. " // In April 1945 , with United States troops overrunning southern Okinawa , the desperate Japanese high command decided to strike at the invading force with the Yamato , the biggest battleship ever built . Because there were not enough planes or pilots to provide air cover , the Yamato sailed into combat accompanied only by eight escort ships . Intercepted by American carrier planes 200 miles from Okinawa , it was sunk in two hours with a loss of more than 3 , 000 lives. // " A Glorious Way to Die " is the chronicle of that suicidal mission by Russell Spurr , an editor of the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review .

Miss Margolis acquired the Spurr book while she was at Bantam , after having met the author in Hong Kong during a business trip to China , and she subsequently acquired hard-cover and book-club rights for ) Newmarket. // Mr. Spurr , a Briton who served in the Royal Indian Navy during World War II , first learned of the Yamato during the occupation of Japan , when he was assigned to Kure , the navy base in southern Honshu , where the ship was built . He took notes at the time , but he stored them away until the mid-1970 ' s when , during an interview with one of Japan ' s leading naval historians , he noticed a picture of the Yamato on the wall . His interest reawakened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . " He had been doing all the research on his own , but he hadn ' t written the manuscript , " Miss Margolis said , " and when he told me about it at dinner , I was fascinated . " The book is a Literary Guild alternate selection and a full selection of the Military Book Club . Miss Margolis is pleased - and surprised . " I never thought over the years that the first book I ' d publish would be about the kamikaze mission of a battleship. " //
