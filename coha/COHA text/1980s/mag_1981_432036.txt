 | They 're called surrogate mothers . Some do it for money , others for love . Here is an inside look at a fast-growing phenomenon . Elizabeth Kane pressed her nose against the glass of the nursery for newborns in a Louisville , Ky. , hospital and peered at the beautiful eight-pound ten-ounce baby boy she had given birth to three days earlier . It was her first really good look at her son . And she knew it was also her last . " He looked very cute , " recalls Elizabeth . " I said hello to him ? and good-bye . On that day my milk came out and so did my tears . " Shortly after that morning last November , Elizabeth and her husband , David ( not their real names ) , flew back to Pekin , Ill. , to a warm welcome from their three children and to a generally icy reception from their hometown . Neighbors snubbed Elizabeth . Her own parents accused her of giving away their grandchild . Her children were taunted by some of their classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kentucky couple who became the infant 's parents ? they had been in the delivery room and observed the birth ? Elizabeth Kane is a saint . She unselfishly gave them the baby they never thought they 'd have . " We really feel she did it as a gift of love , " says the adoptive mother , who reports that their new son bears a remarkable resemblance to her husband . It 's not surprising that he does . Because her husband is the boy 's biological father . Elizabeth Kane is a surrogate mother . She agreed to be artificially inseminated with the sperm of a man whose wife could not bear him children . And she was paid an undisclosed sum of money for undergoing the insemination , carrying the child for nine months and turning over the infant immediately after birth to the sperm donor and his wife . Elizabeth is by no means the first stand-in mother . Historical precedent dates back to the Scriptures . When Abraham wanted an heir , his barren wife , Sarah , gave him her young Egyptian handmaiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply visited Hagar 's tent . No one really knows exactly how many women have served as modern-day surrogates . But about five years ago advertisements seeking surrogates began to appear in classified sections in newspapers in various parts of the country . This one in a California newspaper drew 160 responses : Childless couple with infertile wife wants female donor for artificial insemination . State fee . All responses confidential . In June 1978 the San Francisco Chronicle reported that 18 months earlier , a male Sundayschool teacher had paid an unmarried woman $7,000 plus medical expenses in return for bearing his child . In Oak Ridge , Tenn. , a 30-year-old woman , who already had a 10-year-old son , gave birth to a six-pound five-ounce baby girl as a surrogate for her married sister who lived in New England . The surrogate 's son and her sister were all present at the delivery . Said the midwife who officiated at the birth , " I never saw so much love and happiness in all my life . " Three years ago a Detroit couple made headlines when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gynecologist was willing to do the insemination ( for fear of malpractice  | suits ) , Debbie , the wife , had performed the procedure on her friend Susan , using a diabetic syringe with a removable needle and following the directions in a family medical guide . ( Eventually the same friend bore a second baby for the couple . ) Surrogate motherhood is a strange new phenomenon , difficult for many to understand . Why does a woman want to have a baby for another woman ? How can a woman deliberately become pregnant , suffer morning sickness , experience her expanding body , feel life within her , undergo the emotional and physical upheaval of childbirth ? and then still go through with her plan to give away her baby ? Motives seem to vary . Elizabeth Kane says she became a surrogate because of her great sympathy for women who are unable to have children . Elizabeth and her husband did not want any more children ( they have three , aged 13 , II . and four ) . In fact , David had a vasectomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she considered herself a likely candidate . " I thought , why not , why ca n't I help a woman who needs a baby ? I have babies so easily ? they just pop out . " So even though she was 38 ? in the later range of her childbearing years ? Elizabeth Kane went ahead and had a baby for a childless woman she did not know . Susan , the surrogate mother in Detroit , acted out of deep friendship . Her friends Debbie and George had visited Catholic Social Services and brought home the sad news of a seven-year waiting list for a baby . ( Other adoption agencies had already turned them away , insisting there were no infants . ) Susan was determined to help her friend . Susan herself had had an exceptionally stormy childhood , filled with poverty and quarrels between her alcoholic parents who separated when she was eight . She had no desire to marry or raise children of her own . In fact , she was still a virgin . " Debbie was my best friend , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift , something she could not have . And one day I thought , I can carry a baby for her . That will be my accomplishment . ' " Patricia , a Kentucky mother of three ( aged seven , three , and two ) is pregnant with a child she is bearing for someone else . She does not con-98  | sider herself very special . " I do n't think I 'm Wonder Woman or an angel , " she says . " But I feel really good about what I am doing . This baby will bring a lot of joy and love to a childless couple . So few infants are available for adoption . Too many women are having abortions or not having babies . Why should a couple have to settle for an older child if they want an infant ? " Mary Ann , a 24-year-old , married clerical worker in Kentucky is trying to become a surrogate mother . She has undergone two attempts at insemination but , so far , without success . She says , " I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd grow up , get married , and have children . I never thought it would n't happen . And it did happen . But I have a friend who ca n't have children , and I know how badly she wants them . Why should n't I help her ? " Is money ever a motive for these women ? One surrogate in her early thirties admits that money was an important consideration . She is a widow and her $10,000 compensation will help her raise her three-year-old-son . Childless couples are often willing to pay dearly for the privilege of parenthood , and payments are rumored to range from $1,000 to $35,000 and some even higher . A rebellious streak may have added spark to the giving nature of a 21-year-old single woman from Maryland who bore a child for a Delaware couple last year . She described herself as someone who " does n't listen to anyone , just to my intuition . This is something I wanted to do . " Her mother said of her , " She 's always been something of a humanitarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the underdog . " Psychiatrist Philip Parker of South-  | field , Mich. , points out that many women like to be pregnant : " It gives them a feeling of power . They are creating new life , something no man can do . For others , pregnancy is the last word in femininity . Another group responds to a symbiotic nurturing relationship with the fetus . " But no matter how strongly motivated she is , a surrogate can not escape an emotional tug of war . " It 's not easy , " says Patricia , the woman who is now pregnant . " I feel the baby kick and move . Yet I know the baby is not ours . I have to force myself to stay away from the infants ' department of stores . I have to keep everything in perspective . " Patricia is certain that if she ever sees her baby , she may not be able to surrender the child . So she is giving up the baby ? without looking . Susan , who had two babies for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonding . " Each time , I hoped the child would n't look like me . I did n't want to be attached . I did n't want to mess up everything we 'd planned for . " Elizabeth Kane felt so strongly that she was carrying another woman 's baby that , while she was still lying on the delivery table , she asked permission of the adoptive mother to unwrap the baby and have a quick peek . Even so , Elizabeth found total emotional divorce impossible . Today she occasionally thinks about the baby . " He was with me so long . Sometimes I just wonder how he is . " Surrogates must also cope with husbands , families , friends , neighbors . What do they tell them ? When Patricia told her husband , a restaurant manager , that she wanted to become a surrogate , he was not at all enthusiastic . " People do n't do that , ' he told me . " On the other hand , the husband of Mary Ann , who 's trying to become a surrogate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's a 29-year-old management consultant and very practical . So he urged her to make sure she knew exactly what surrogate mother-  | hood entailed , especially from a legal point of view . David Kane admittedly was flabbergasted when his wife , Elizabeth , approached him . " I 'd never heard of anything like this . It took me a long time to accept the idea . " But in the end he accepted so thoroughly that he assisted his wife in her delivery by the Lamaze method . Even before the insemination Elizabeth discussed the possibility with her children . " They 're intelligent and perceptive . They thought it a wonderful way to deal with infertility and a good way to help a stranger who desperately needed something I could give . " Patricia now finds it a problem in her pregnancy to figure out what to tell relatives and neighbors ? without going into an overlong explanation and without actually lying . " It 's difficult , " she says , " I have n't really worked it out yet , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from the hospital without a baby . " Adoptive parents who take the surrogate route usually do so in desperation , after all else has failed . Debbie , who helped inseminate her friend Susan , had undergone a hysterectomy , ending her own chance to conceive . She describes the despair of so many sterile women : " When you see a mother with her child , your arms feel empty . There 's a void no one can fill , not your husband , not your mother , not your friends . And knowing you ca n't ever conceive a child makes you feel twice as empty . " Kathy and David , both 32 and both working in the computer industry in the Southwest , have taken the preliminary steps to obtain a baby from a surrogate . They describe a different emptiness . " Part of the need , " explains Kathy , who had a hysterectomy before her marriage three years ago , " is the love my husband and I feel for each other . You grow to a point where you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with a child . That becomes extremely important the longer you are together . " While waiting for a successful insemination , the couple has decorated a nursery with David 's baby furniture . " The theme is Raggedy Ann , " says Kathy . " We have lots of balloons all around . You know , I already feel a bond for the child who 's not even conceived . " The couple plan a celebration when they hear there 's a baby on the way . " We 'll probably pop a bottle of champagne , " says Kathy . " Then we 'll call our friends and parents to tell everyone we 're pregnant . " Despite their excitement at getting a baby , some adoptive parents may still face- problems and conflicts . Debbie 's in-laws have n't spoken to her or her husband since the birth of their two children by a surrogate . And a priest told them , " There 's no sin on your children , but the sin is on you . You 've used sperm in another woman 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisville , Kentucky . It facilitates the matching of adoptive parents and surrogate mothers and draws up legal contracts . Kentucky is the only known state in which it is feasible for adoptive mothers to establish residency for adoption purposes , and even there the state attorney general has called the surrogate-motherhood pro-  | cedure illegal . ( Only the mother needs to sign adoptive papers since her husband is the baby 's biological father . ) Dr. Richard Levin , 35 , a fertility specialist , and Katie Brophy , 25 , an attorney , have founded The Surrogate Parenting Association . Their screening process is rigorous and thorough . ( " It 's not just a simple filling out of an application , " says the now-pregnant Patricia , who 's been through it . ) The surrogate must undergo a complete physical , an examination of her genetic history , and a psychological evaluation to determine her emotional stability and motivation . And she must terminate parental rights following adoption . Single , childless surrogates are discouraged by the association because of their unproved fertility and possible emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial compensation . The average fee is about $15,000 for the complete package , the final amount depending on how much travel is required , how many interviews are needed , and how many inseminations must be attempted . The major share of the fee goes to the surrogate mother as compensation for her " potential loss of income , loss of consortium with her husband , pain and suffering , and potential risk of death . " The rest goes for insurance , legal , and medical costs . Adoptive parents must accept responsibility for the child , irrespective of its state of health . ( Because she was 38 , surrogate Elizabeth Kane underwent amniocentesis to make sure she was carrying a healthy child . ) During the waiting period , adoptive parents must consider how and whether to tell their child about the special circumstances of his birth . The young waiting couple ? with the Raggedy Ann nursery ? believe that any child they get will have the right to know the truth . They have even taped television shows dealing with surrogate motherhood and plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that the baby will be part of my husband , " says Kathy . " The child will have a heritage we can give . We want to be a normal family . " B ut it might be some time before the whole idea of surrogate motherhood is accepted as normal and everyday . However , as a Chicago sociologist points out , years back there was a stigma attached to adoption that is no longer true today . The first babies born by artificial insemination made headlines . But now there are around 10,000 such births a year . Baby Louise , the first test-tube baby ? conceived outside her mother 's body ? was a world-wide sensation . These days hundreds of women are seeking to be impregnated in this manner . So who knows ? Maybe in a relatively short time surrogate motherhood may no longer shock our sense of what is normal and acceptable . Meantime , Elizabeth Kane , who has settled back into her life as a homemaker and mother of three in Pekin , Ill. , with her marriage strengthened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had a glimpse of the adoptive parents in the delivery room . I 'll never forget the delight on their faces ? what the sight of the baby meant to that woman . Maybe it does hurt me a little . So what ? It was worth every minute of it " .
