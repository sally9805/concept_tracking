TIME Senior Writer and Film Critic Richard Corliss watched his first movie , Cheaper by the Dozen , at age five in his hometown of Philadelphia . Eleven years and countless boxes of popcorn later , he viewed Ingmar Bergman 's The Seventh Seal and was struck by the realization that films could be more than mere entertainment . That marked the beginning of a fascination with the cinema that took Corliss to the Cote d'Azur to report this week 's two-page Show Business story on the Cannes Film Festival . <P> Between Philadelphia and the French Riviera was a lengthy apprenticeship . At St. Joseph 's College , Corliss helped edit the school newspaper . After studying film history at Columbia University and at New York University , he worked as a film critic for publications as disparate as the National Review , New Times and the now defunct Soho News before joining TIME in 1980 . In addition to his reviewer 's duties , Corliss co-edits a bimonthly journal called Film Comment ( circ. 48,000 ) , scouts films for the New York Film Festival 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Film Critics Circle , an association of reviewers who write for magazines and newspapers . <P> Corliss likens his sojourn in Cannes to " summer camp in the dark . " It was his 15th consecutive festival ( he started attending in 1973 ) . " In Cannes , critics mingle with charming men and beautiful women whose films they secretly plan to savage . For a fortnight on the Riviera , I had a great time . " <P> Back in New York City , Corliss avoids film-industry receptions and social contacts with actors and actresses . " Critics by nature are antisocial beasts . We dodge movie stars because we do n't want to believe that those huge gorgeous creatures on the screen are real , tiny people with real , tender feelings that could be dented by an offhand joke in print . " Each week he sees an average of a dozen films , usually in screening rooms but sometimes in crowded Times Square theaters . " I like to slip into theaters unnoticed . On Broadway the audience 's critical comments are often more piquant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all watching . " <P> Despite his familiarity with almost every aspect of the moviemaking business , Corliss has no interest in writing screenplays , directing , producing or acting . Says he : " I 'm more analytic than creative . My main interest is batting out shapely prose that will inform the reader . "
