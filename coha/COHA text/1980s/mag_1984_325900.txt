Reagan 's speech in the Great Hall of the People , Chinese officials promised , was to be broadcast in full on TV , even though it had not been cleared with Chinese authorities in advance . But before it aired that evening , 17 segments were deleted . Among them : <P> On national religious faith . How did America become the leading economic nation in the world ? We have drawn tremendous power from two great forces , faith and freedom . America was founded by people who sought freedom to worship God and to trust Him to guide them in their daily lives with wisdom , strength , goodness and compassion . <P> On U.S.-style democracy . Trust the people . These three words are the most powerful force for human progress in the world today . Those who ignore this vital truth will condemn their countries to fall farther and farther behind . <P> On free enterprise . In the United States , as I mentioned earlier , we have always believed deeply that incentives are key and that free people build free markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.S.R. We threaten no nation . America 's troops are not massed on China 's borders , and we occupy no lands . Nor do we commit wanton acts , such as shooting 269 innocent people out of the sky for the so-called cause of sacred airspace . America and China both condemn military expansionism-the brutal occupation of Afghanistan , the crushing of Kampuchea Cambodia .
