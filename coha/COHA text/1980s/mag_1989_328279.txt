Vartan Gregorian , newly installed president of Brown University , last week decried the poor quality of America 's public schools . An excerpt : <P> " Now , in the midst of the explosion of information , knowledge and complex challenges facing us , the American university can not afford the luxury of transforming its first two years of instruction to meet the woeful inadequacies of our public school system . We can not afford to relegate 50% of the university 's time and resources to remedial work . . . The universities in two years can not do justice to twelve years of neglect in learning . We are our high schools ' keepers . The nation must take preventive measures to reform , strengthen and in some instances rescue our high school system . "
