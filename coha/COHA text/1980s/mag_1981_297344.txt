Crowding at the top <P> R. Max Peterson , chief of the U.S. Forest Service , earns $50,112.50 a year . So does Associate Chief Douglas Leisz . So , in fact , do the five deputy chiefs below Leisz , the eight associate deputy chiefs below them , and almost half of the 35 staff directors below the associate deputy chiefs . In all , 177 people at the Forest Service are at that salary level . Says Kenneth Rashid , a Consumer Product Safety Commission official : " Only a committed Marxist could love a system where everybody makes the same amount of money . It simply stifles ambition and creativity and hard work . " <P> The problems began in 1978 , when Congress , anxious to display its inflation-fighting zeal , put a cap on salaries paid to career bureaucrats . The unforeseen result : 6,000 senior managers now earn the same amount as some 30,000 subordinates who reached the limit by annual cost of living increases . Unless the ceiling is lifted , within two years 135,000 federal employees will be bunched together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Socolar : " This situation is absurd . " <P> Frustrated career executives are leaving federal jobs in droves for better pay in the private sector . The retirement rate among senior supervisors between 55 and 59 alone was an astonishing 95% for the year ending last August , compared with a 15.5% rate in March 1978 . C. Roy McKinnon , 51 , was assistant director of the FBI for administration , one of the highest posts at the bureau , when he quit . " Hell , " he says , " the assistant special agent in charge at the smallest FBI field office was making the same as I was . " Adds Robert L. Van Ness , 40 , who resigned as director of the Energy Department 's office of financial incentives in June : " It did n't make much sense to spend my most productive years depending on the whim of Congress for whatever modest increase they might provide at erratic moments . " <P> The salaries of senior bureaucrats are tied by law to congressional paychecks , and lately the lawmakers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Federal judges have been able to avoid the pay cap , but only through a legal technicality . Salaries for U.S. district court judges , for example , have risen from $54,500 to $67,100 since the ceiling was imposed . <P> Assistant Senate Majority Leader Ted Stevens has scheduled hearings next month to examine the problems . Even David Stockman , President Reagan 's budget cutter , acknowledges that something must be done . But the stingy 97th Congress may not want to listen .
