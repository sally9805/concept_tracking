Want to see the big trees of Washington and Oregon , the great Douglas firs and red cedars ? Stay in your car . Keep to the main roads . Avoid high , distant views . In the national forests here , the policy of the U.S. Forest Service has been to leave buffer zones of uncut trees along the tourist highways . It is prettier that way . It is also easier for the Forest Service , which has fewer letters of outrage to answer about the scarification that used to be a coastal rain forest . <P> On the other hand , if you want to see what is really happening , get in touch with Michael Stewartt , the chief pilot , troublemaker , idea man and fund raiser of an extraordinary environmental flying service called Project Lighthawk . Just now a couple of local environmentalists , a journalist and Stewartt are aboard one of Lighthawk 's two Cessna 210s . Stewartt , a lean , relaxed fellow of 38 , with a bushy light brown mustache and hair to match , radios his plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field . <P> We take off to the south , then head west . Below is the Hood Canal , an arm of Puget Sound , and the Navy shipyard at Bremerton . Ahead , partly obscured by clouds , are the Olympic Peninsula and the huge trees and muscular ridges and peaks of Olympic National Park . What we want to see from the air is the Shelton sustained-yield area , a heavily logged region just short of the park , most of it in the Olympic National Forest . <P> Stewartt and Forestry Consultant Peter Morrison , working with the help of the Wilderness Society , have just nailed down what is either a very large bureaucratic fraud or a conveniently jumbled process of long-term fudging . Environmentalists had suspected for a long time that the Forest Service had vastly overestimated the amount of old growth  --  virgin forest  --  still left in the Northwest . Traditionally , the Forest Service has disapproved of messy , tangled old-growth forests , whose dank , rotting understory and ancient trees it has referred to as " overmature " and " decadent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then treat trees as if they were very large soybean plants that could be " harvested " for timber on a rotation basis every 60 or 80 or 100 years in " sustained-yield " areas . <P> Overestimating the amount of old growth still standing , by underreporting clear-cuts or by counting mature second growth as primal forest , is convenient because it reduces the urgency of squawks from environmentalists . But Stewartt and Morrison ( a Forest Service employee moonlighting on his days off ) drew circles in red pencil around old-growth areas on the Forest Service 's own aerial maps . Then they flew off to find the trees .
