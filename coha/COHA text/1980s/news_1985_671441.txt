The school could not find enough trombonists and clarinetists to send its concert band to a regional contest , two of the school ' s four choirs were so denuded of singers that they dropped out of competition , and 19 members of the school ' s 60-member track team were benched. // The head football coach , Jim Bennett , is so worried that he will be unable to field a strong team next fall that he has canceled practice every Wednesday , bringing guest teachers to be sure his athletes know as much about passing tests as passing a football . Failing players are tutored at least three times a week. // The reason for all this is a stringent new state law , part of a sweeping education program adopted last year , that commands that any student who fails to attain a grade of 70 in any course must be barred from extracurricular activities for the next grading period. // The " no pass , no play " provision has stirred about as much emotion in Texas as anything since Santa Anna overran the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harsh , but Gov . Mark White and other political leaders are strongly committed to preserving the rule. // There is no question that the law , hailed nationally by educators as putting Texas in the forefront of tightening education standards , is changing the lives of the four million school children in Texas. // The Legislature passed the program amid growing fears that students in Texas were lagging behind the nation in academic achievement and that Texas schools were failing to prepare youngsters for jobs in a rapidly changing economy. // The program revamped schedules for teacher salaries and promotions , forbade nonacademic activities in school hours and imposed competence testing on teachers and students . Most of it has been accepted quietly , though teachers remain unhappy over their pay. // Educators and others will be watching the results of this semester ' s grading and statewide tests , but there is not yet any concrete evidence to show whether the law has achieved its main purpose of raising academic achievement. // Since the law requiring suspensions from extracurricular activities took effect Jan. 1 , the newspapers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor students barred from the debate team because they failed one difficult course , of youngsters who spent hundreds of dollars raising prize pigs and steers only to be barred from showing them at livestock shows , of top athletes whose college scholarships have been jeopardized , of decimated drill and cheerleading squads . At least four lawsuits have been filed by infuriated parents. // " This is one of the most emotional issues we ' ve ever seen in our district , " said Gay Curry , an aide to one legislative opponent of the changes , State Senator Robert J. Glasgow , a Democrat from north-central Texas . The Senator has said that some of his young constitutents have become " suicidal . " <> <> Perot Opposes Retreat // But the man chiefly responsible for the law , H. Ross Perot , the Dallas computer entrepeneur who headed a gubernatorial commission on education last year , adamantly opposes any retreat. // " This is revolutionary change - you ' ve got to expect some rumbling , " he said . " We are not asking kids to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very important not do anything to tell children that it is more important to play than to study. " // Despite the loud complaints from some students and parents , the changes have gained the strong , if less vocal , backing of business groups , educators and many parents . Moreover , the state ' s top elected leaders , including Governor White , Lieut . Gov . William Hobby and House Speaker Gib Lewis , all remain strongly committed to preserving the law , which the State Board of Education has interpreted to call for six-week suspensions of extracurricular activity. // This month the State Senate resisted pressures to water down the rule , though it passed a bill authorizing the 15-member Board of Education to reduce the six-week suspension period if it saw fit . The House has not yet acted . <> <> Half the Students Participate // Here in Irving , a suburb of Dallas , one can see evidence of the enormous importance of extracurricular activities in Texas . At Irving High School about 40 percent of the 1 , 775 students stay after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill or other programs , according to the principal , Curtis Hines . The football team , the Tigers , is the pride of the community. // " There was a need for reform in this state , " said Mr. Hines , but he added that he felt the Legislature was not sensitive enough to the needs of students. // " I have no problem with a student who does not pass not participating , " he said . " But now at 3 : 30 we have to release them to the streets instead , removing them from a positive environment to an unsupervised one . " This spring 119 of the 700 or so Irving High students who particpate in extracurricular activities were barred for six weeks. // About 25 percent of those in spring sports were benched , and the football coach , Mr. Bennett , is determined that this will not happen in the fall . He has been monitoring his squad all spring and says that through special tutoring the number of failures has been reduced 30 percent . <> <> English Among the Barbells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to the weight room at the field house to get some academic advice from Judi Purvis , head of the English department . Standing amid barbells and weight-lifting benches , Miss Purvis tried to liken preparation for English to preparation for a big weekend game. // " If you don ' t practice until Thursday for a Friday game , can you win ? " she said . " How do you think you can prepare for English if you do not pace it ? You want to win that game but you ' ve got to work. " // There is evidence , despite the complaints , that the law is having the desired effect here . " I ' m not in a position to change the law , so our approach is to make the best of it , " said Coach Bennett . He has forced his academically weak players into tutoring. // " Before , we could not get them into tutoring , " said Miss Purvis. // John Kinser and Ben Alvarez , juniors on the football team , are being tutored . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eliminated from choir . Ben failed English and was barred from track for six weeks , missing four or five meets . John concedes that the tutoring " really helps a lot . " Ben is less enthusiastic , but he says his parents are quite pleased . <> <> ' Kids Will Lose Interest ' // " I don ' t feel athletics should be placed above academics , " said Mr. Bennett , the coach . " But many kids will lose interest in school . We can teach vital things for them to go into life. " // Mr. Bennett ' s views are widely echoed by coaches around the state , but not necessarily by most teachers . The coaches contend that the rule penalizes even passing students and is encouraging weaker students to drop out of school or avoid hard courses. // At Edgewood Senior High School in east Texas this spring , the track team lost half its half-mile relay team a week before the district meet . " It just wiped us out , " said Coach David Whiting . " The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Don Jay , executive vice president of the Texas High School Coaches Association , said , " We are in favor of academic excellence , but we feel extracurricular activities are such a positive experience that the student should have an opportunity to practice. " // A survey of his members , he said , disclosed that 52 percent of freshman team members were failing one or more courses . " I ' m interested in knowing how many will come back next year , " he said . " The law is encouraging kids to drink and do drugs. " // In many rural parts of the state parents and children question whether academics are all that important . At Pflugerville High School , which draws students from a 100-square-mile area of central Texas , 31 students were disqualified from showing their livestock at shows this spring. // According to Larry Bradley , the principal , most of them played hooky and went to the shows anyway , " and made worse grades because of that . " One student , he said , spent more than $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 , 500 at the show . <> <> Reduced Exclusion Discussed // There is wide agreement among coaches and many administrators that the six-week exclusion should be cut to three weeks , or even to one or two. // That is vigorously opposed by Governor White and his education director , Larry Yawn . " The issue is not how long they ' ll be out of extracurricular activities , but why the students are failing , " Mr. Yawn said . " If you shorten the exclusion , you can not really tell if the student has really raised his grade . We are trying to reassert the importance of academics in the school day . This is not punishment. " // The Governor is sensitive to suggestions that his changes have hit hardest on schools with large minority enrollments . He recently honored Madison High School , a mostly black school in Houston that won the state basketball championship with an all-black team helped by special tutoring. // Although 52. 7 percent of the high school students in the Houston Independent School District , the state ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district ' s leadership firmly backs the Governor. // " It ' s working very well here , " said Geri Konigsberg , spokesman for the Superintendent of Schools , Bill Reagan . " We are in favor of the law because we do not feel that as adults the kids are going to get a break on the job or in college . We understand the problems the kids may be facing , but they got plenty of notice. " // Less enthusiastic is Joe Tusa , athletic director for the district , who said he felt the rule would work better if the suspension were reduced to one week , which he said would provide more incentive for students to study and requalify quickly. // Some people in the Legislature expect that if legislators grant the authority , the State Board of Education , under heavy pressure , will arrive at a compromise for the fall that reduces the suspension to three weeks. //
