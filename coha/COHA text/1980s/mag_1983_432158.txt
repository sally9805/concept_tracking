 | Death and dying , topics that Americans traditionally have spoken of only in private or have tried to ignore altogether , are intruding upon the nation 's consciousness as never before . Dramatic , life-prolonging medical advances , the desire of more people to " control " the act of dying , a growing population of elderly and concerns over funeral costs have spawned a panoply of nagging moral and ethical dilemmas . Just this year alone A pregnant California woman , declared legally dead from a severe brain seizure in January , was put on lifesupport systems to allow the fetus to mature . After a healthy baby was delivered on March 24 , the woman was taken off the machines and immediately stopped breathing . A Los Angeles judge dismissed charges that two physicians had violated their legal responsibilities by ordering that a comatose patient be taken off a respirator and intravenous feedings . Writer Arthur Koestler , suffering from leukemia and Parkinson 's disease , committed suicide along with his wife , adding fuel to the debate over euthanasia . Barney Clark , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2 , lived on for 112 more days with the help of an artificial heart . A federal judge struck down the Reagan administration 's " Baby Doe " rule that urged hospital employes to tell federal officials if defective infants were being denied food or medical treatment . With such issues grabbing headlines , college professors ' * report that courses on death and dying are among the most popular on campus , where young people , many of whom have never been to a funeral or visited a terminal patient , are trying to understand life 's deepest mystery . In what observers call the " gloom boom , " more books on the subject ? ranging from controversial manuals on how to commit suicide to studies of " near death " experiences ? have been written in the last decade or so than in the entire last century . Millions of people have taken out living wills , directing the sort of medical treatment they should receive in their last days . Others are shopping in advance for funeral arrangements to save their families the trouble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all adds up to a more honest confrontation with an issue that most individuals would rather sweep from their minds . " It is n't an easy thing to do , but more people are at least trying to come to grips with death , grief and loss , " says sociologist Vanderlyn Pine of the State University of New York at New Paltz . One reason death is now less threatening to many Americans is that it has become , as sociologist Robert Fulton of the University of Minnesota puts it , " the monopoly of the elderly . " Last year , more than 70 percent of the 2 million people who died in the U.S. were age 65 or older , and just 5 percent were under the age of 15 . Many of these . elderly spend their last years in nursing homes ? in effect , waiting to die . Other senior citizens have moved off to retirement communities or have been left a behind themselves by children who have moved on to other cities . Whatever the reason for the separation , notes Fulton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives well before death occurs . Says Fulton : " There is a tendency to observe that these people have lived long , full lives and that it is only normal and natural that they be allowed to die in peace . " The idea of a peaceful and natural death , however , often comes in direct conflict with medical science , with its defibrillators to restore regular heartbeat , respirators to aid breathing , dialysis machines for failing kidneys and wonder drugs to ease pain , sustain blood pressure and enhance other key bodily functions . With 80 percent of deaths now occurring in hospitals and other institutions , physicians are confronted almost daily with whether to use these tools to prolong the lives of gravely ill patients . As often as not , it is a complicated , delicate decision made against a background of murky law . In California , for example , physicians can not legally take a patient off a respirator unless tests show a complete absence of brain function . Yet , with the permission of patients or their families , medical teams time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely brain-damaged patients who , they believe , have no chance of recovery . " It is a courageous and risky thing to do , but many doctors are doing it anyway , " says the Rev. Ernie Young , a chaplain at Stanford University Hospital . Such situations are made more difficult , however , when the patient or family disagrees with the advice of the doctor or when the patient is mentally incompetent , leaving no indication of how he or she would want to be treated .  | For fear of prosecution by law-enforcement officials or out of a genuine belief that a patient might improve , some doctors or hospital officials still refuse to take patients off life-support systems . Last October , Peter Cinque , a painfully ill diabetic in New York , had to appeal to the State Supreme Court to get a Long Island hospital to stop dialysis and let him die as he asked . He died shortly after the court ordered an end to the treatment . In New Jersey , Karen Ann Quinlan ? one of about 5,000 " permanently unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than seven years after her parents won a State Supreme Court ruling to remove her respirator . Yet observers say most physicians now are less tempted to press for the indiscriminate use of extraordinary or " heroic " means of keeping patients alive . " The vitalist approach ? that a person must be kept alive no matter what ? is now the minority view , " says Alice Mehling , executive director of the Society for the Right to Die , a New York group concerned with the welfare of terminal patients . " There 's a more realistic understanding that all technological mechanisms do n't have to be used . " To give guidance to families and doctors , 14 states and the District of Columbia have passed " right to die " bills ? and 22 more are considering such measures ? that recognize the right of individuals to sign living wills . These documents specify whether or not patients want to be connected to life-sustaining machinery if they should become unable to speak for themselves . Although more than 5 million of these wills have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means perfect . In some states , doctors in theory are bound to follow the directions specified in the wills ; in other cases , the wills are merely advisory . A major problem is that the language is often vague . Many wills use phrases such as " my dying shall not be artificially prolonged " without mentioning the specific procedures that are to be avoided . Thus , a doctor has plenty of loopholes . Experts note that the wills at least give physicians some idea of a patient 's intent and make the medical team less fearful of legal prosecution if extraordinary treatment is withheld . However , a report released in March by a special presidential commission on ethical problems in medicine recommends another alternative : Giving power of attorney to a trusted friend or family member in the event one is too sick to make decisions . Some 42 states recognize this technique , which Dr. Joanne Lynn , director of the commission 's report on " Deciding to Forgo Life-Sustaining Treatment , " calls a more effective and flexible means of " controlling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of a mentally competent patient to halt treatment when there is no hope of recovery , recommends that hospitals set up a regular system of internal review to help physicians make decisions about difficult cases involving dying patients . What these patient's-rights issues show , experts say , is the need for medical staffs to become much more sensitive to the requirements of dying individuals ? a class of patient that doctors traditionally have viewed as " medical failures . " More medical schools are beginning to add courses on gerontology , and more hospitals are hiring philosophers and chaplains trained in ethics . At Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx , staff philosopher John Arras works with nurses , social-services personnel and physicians in dealing with dying patients and their families . Among the cases he has addressed : Should an elderly man , with failing mental powers , have the right to refuse an operation to detect cancer , or should the hospital overrule him for his own good ? Should the hospital respect the wishes of a woman in her early 40s dying of cancer to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a great deal of legal confusion , and doctors still are supercautious . In unclear cases , they will usually choose to maintain life . " Also spurring debate is the question of whether it is ever proper for a suffering , terminally ill patient to take his or her own life ? or for others to help that process along . While many ? if not most ? doctors , clergy and legal authorities publicly disapprove of euthanasia , there are signs of growing sympathy in U.S. society for the practice . There were few public outcries , for example , when Arthur Koestler , the ailing 77-year-old author of Darkness at Noon and other works , committed suicide in London in early March along with his wife by taking an overdose of barbiturates . Koestler was a member of a voluntary-euthanasia group called EXIT . Since Koestler 's death , membership has grown in the Hemlock Society , the U.S. version of EXIT , according to the group 's founder , Derek Humphry . He helped his wife ? then dying of cancer ? to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 , Hemlock now claims 7,500 members , only 10 percent of whom are described as terminally ill . " We encourage people to hang on to life , " says Humphry , " but when the end does come , we are saying that individuals ought to be able to control how they die and not have to suffer terrible pain or lose control of mental faculties and bodily functions . " Humphry , who last year published Let Me Die Before I Wake , a manual on suicide that gives specific lethal doses of drugs , says some 40 people have committed suicide with the help of the guide . Many experts on death and dying condemn such an approach outright . " We as Christians believe that pain is part of salvation and that it can be a healing thing and a force to bring people together , " says the Rev. Miles Riley , a Roman Catholic priest in San Francisco who has written a book on preparing for death . Nevertheless , says sociologist Fulton , who heads the Center for Death Education and Research at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for euthanasia is on the rise . If I took a poll of students in my classes and asked if gravely ill older people should be allowed to take their own lives , more than half would say Yes . ' " Others note that it is extremely rare for someone to go to ILLUSTRATION BY HAROLD SMELLER Books on " near death " experiences describe people being bathed in a bright but comforting light . J.S.NEWS &; WORLD REPORT , July 11 , 1983 63  | jail for mercy killing . In February , a distressed father was released without bail after he walked into the Army 's Walter Reed Hospital in Washington , D.C. , and fatally wounded a son who had suffered severe burns in a suicide attempt . He has yet to be indicted . Similarly , in early April , a grand jury in Florida refused to indict a 79-year-old man who had shot and killed his wife , whose mind had been devastated by Alzheimer 's disease .

In an issue of Nursing Life magazine earlier this year , 8 percent of nurses surveyed in a study on ethical dilemmas admitted to intentionally giving overdoses of narcotics to dying patients . Despite such developments and the increased interest in studying euthanasia , many authorities worry that legal approval of mercy killing could bring with it many abuses and would be a harmful step toward social engineering . Whether the issue is euthanasia or how to cope with grief , Americans ca n't seem to get enough of the subject of death . Since 1959 , when Herman Feifel wrote his pioneering work , The Meaning of Death , nearly 1,000 books have been written on death and dying . One of the top-selling books last year was When Bad Things Happen to Good People , written by Harold S. Kushner , a Massachusetts rabbi trying to come to grips with the death of his 14-year-old son from progeria , a disease that causes the aging process to escalate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieving parents throughout the country , and funeral directors and health associations have ordered thousands of copies to help families deal with the loss of loved ones . Also popular : Books describing the near-death experiences of individuals resuscitated after cardiac arrest or other medical crises . In his Recollections of Death , published last year , Atlanta cardiologist Michael Sabom related the experiences of 116 such patients , many of whom described how they seemed to rise out of their bodies and observed the medical team trying to revive them . Many also told of enjoying a tremendous feeling of peace , of being bathed in a bright light , of undergoing a life review or encountering deceased relatives . While critics have labeled these experiences mere dreams , fabrications or hallucinations brought on by painkilling drugs or release of chemicals in the brain , at least a half-dozen books have been written attempting to give scientific evidence of the phenomenon . The International Association for Near Death Studies also has been set up at the University of Connecticut to foster research in the area . " Whatever the explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to many people v at the moment of death , " says Connecticut psychologist Kenneth Ring , who stresses that near-death experiences do not prove the existence of afterlife but merely show that the act of dying may not be the agonizing event many people fear . Beyond these studies and the swelling literature in the field , courses in death and dying are attracting thousands of students nationwide . Courses at the University of Maryland involve everything from discussions of ethical and legal issues to work with dying patients . Students go so far as to fill out their death certificates and predict the dates and causes of death . " The purpose is not to dwell on death for its own sake but to improve the quality of living , " says Prof. Daniel Leviton of Maryland . " If we all realize that we could die tomorrow , then we will do a better job of setting our priorities in life and make every day count . " Not only is thanatology ? the study of death , from the Greek word thanatos ? becoming widespread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from many directions . In more cities , counseling centers are being set up to advise doctors , nurses and other medical personnel in the more sensitive treatment of dying patients and to assist families in coping with grief . Typical is the St. Francis 1 Center in Washington , D.C. , which also puts on workshops for high-school students and other groups and even sells simple , low-cost pine coffins . In Buffalo , the Life and Death Transitions Center conducts many of the same activities , but also has a special program for cancer patients . Based on theories advanced by such physicians as Carl Simonton , who has worked successfully with cancer victims in Houston , the program follows the view that stress and depression help to bring on and worsen cancer . Thus , individuals are instructed in methods of exercise and relaxation and advised to exert more control over their lives . " Taking control " is an idea heard often in reference to the process of dying and the events after someone dies . As leading thanatologists see it , Americans have abdicated their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral directors and clergy . This is in contrast to the practice in this country before World War I and in many foreign countries now , where people die at home surrounded by family , where relatives build a coffin for the deceased , wear black armbands and dig the grave . One step in regaining that control is the growing hospice movement , which attempts to put dying patients in a more humane , relaxed environment . Whether the care takes place in a special hospital wing or in a patient 's home , the concept is the same : A team of health practitioners , clergy and volunteers deals with the patient 's physical , psychological and spiritual needs ? and counsels the family as well . Pain-reducing drugs keep the dying person as comfortable as possible , but expensive life-sustaining machinery is avoided , which saves the enormous medical bills of traditional hospitals . From only one program in 1974 , the hospice movement in the U.S. has grown to some 1,100 , with many more in the planning stages . More families also try to exert greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funeral directors ,  | choose lower-cost alternatives to expensive arrangements and make church and memorial services more personal by featuring readings by family and close friends . The Rev. William Phipps , a Presbyterian minister and professor of religion at Davis and Elkins College in West Virginia , says more families now hold a private graveside ceremony for close relatives and a memorial service at a later date for friends that focuses on the life of the deceased . Catholic funeral services have traded black vestments for white and replaced the somber Gregorian chant with joyous hymns that emphasize the passing of a soul into eternal life ? though some critics feel the switch gives too little attention to the reality of family loss . Rabbi Earl Grollman of Belmont , Mass. , notes an increased interest in ritual on the part of Jewish families in Reform congregations . Rather than " sanitize " the process , he notes , more families watch while the casket is being lowered into the grave . More survivors of the deceased also show up at daily services where the kaddish , or prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emphasis was on being strong and getting back to a normal routine in a hurry , " says Rabbi Grollman . The therapeutic value of sharing grief with others is behind the surge in self-help groups . Rather than face the loneliness that often exists when friends and family depart after a funeral , people can meet regularly with others who have gone through similar experiences . Among the many groups : Widow-to-Widow ; Parents of Murdered Children ; Candlelighters , for parents of leukemia victims ; SHARE , serving parents who have suffered miscarriages or had children die at birth , and Compassionate Friends , for families of young people who have died from accidents , by suicide or other causes . Sociologists note that , in a society where most deaths involve older people , the sudden death of a child or youth can be particularly devastating to a family . Letting people have time for grief , experts say , is an important part of an honest approach to death . " It used to be that if a person did n't snap out of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's wrong with you ? ' " observes the Rev. William Wendt , director of the St. Francis Center . " But we now know that it takes much longer than that . In fact , you never really get over the death of someone you love ; you just learn to live with it . " Two decades after Jessica Mitford published The American Way of Death , an attack on lavish and costly burials , the funeral industry remains on the hot seat for promoting what critics view as unnecessary products and services . Much is at stake . Americans spend 6.5 billion dollars a year on funeral expenses , with average burial costs exceeding $2,500 . Many services run $3,000 or more . To make sure the public gets a fair shake , the Federal Trade Commission plans to initiate regulations requiring funeral directors to provide customers itemized price lists of goods and services and to disclose prices by telephone on request . The rules , which could take effect as early as next January unless blocked in the courts by the industry , would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embalming or purchase of a casket for cremation . Some consumer groups say the FTC action does n't go far enough . It does not , for instance , prohibit such practices as displaying cheaper caskets in unattractive colors or fabrics . But William Rutherford , president of the National Funeral Directors Association , claims the evidence does not support a need for regulation . To back his argument , Rutherford , owner of four funeral homes in the Columbus , Ohio , area , cites the experience of ThanaCAP , the industry 's new program for answering consumer complaints . Since it began in April , 1982 , just 30 complaints have been forwarded to the organization 's national offices ? and only five of those will be submitted to binding arbitration . Money loss . Even so , the industry continues to lose revenue to lower-cost burial alternatives . In the last decade , the total of Americans cremated each year ? a process that often costs $500 or less ? has doubled . More than 900,000 people have joined memorial societies , which arrange cremations or negotiate lower-cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mortuaries have declined in number from 24,000 in the 1960s to between 20,000 and 22,000 today . More firms are being taken over by giant companies , such as Service Corporation International , which owns 279 funeral homes , 51 cemeteries and 40 flower shops and had sales of 208.5 million dollars for the year ended April 30 , 1983 . Reflecting growing public desire to hold down costs and make choices prior to death 's emotional turmoil , the company has collected more than 83 million dollars in prepaid funerals . While many sociologists applaud the trend away from showy funerals , many fear that the swift disposal of bodies from place of death to crematories without a memorial service ? a practice that occurs in 20 percent of all deaths in some parts of the West ? denies the reality of death and ignores the fact that a life has been led . There have been recent reports in Los Angeles , too , of large crematories mixing the ashes of several deceased persons without notifying families . " To abandon funeral and grieving rites is to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and community life , " notes sociologist Robert Fulton of the University of Minnesota .
