SALLY FIELD : COMING UP CLOVER The little girl with puffy cheeks blossomed into an Oscar-winning actress after cultivating her talent with drama lessons . by Fred Robbins tt 4There 's something won- / derful about people who try . They are worth everything ; they 're worth the country , " Sally Field said with unexpected fervor . She was talking about the young Southern woman  --  streetwalker , scrapper , uneducated and tough and , finally , fired by hope  --  she plays in Back Roads , the first drama she has filmed since winning last year 's Oscar for Norma Rae . The offscreen actress has one thing in common with her onscreen counterpart . Few know better than Sally Field the satisfaction that comes from battling your way out of a tight corner . Six years ago , she realized she had become a nonperson in Hollywood , if not an actual laughing-stock . Zeroing in on 28 , she had to face the fact that , unless she wanted to continue playing bubbleheaded teen-agers on TV  --  roles she was still being offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a rotten image , " Sally recalls . " Nobody ever thought of me for a movie . They figured no adult would spend money to watch someone like me  --  freckled , round-faced and 5 ' 2 " ? on the big screen . " That year , " the worst of all years , " crisis seemed to meet crisis in Sally Field 's life . She had just divorced her husband of five years , Steve Craig , " my first and only sweetheart at Birmingham High in the San Fernando Valley , " who was then a hopeful but rarely employed screenwriter . And she had two young sons to support , Peter , now10 , and Eli , now 8 . What 's more , she found she was nearly broke . " Money had n't meant a thing to me when I was on TV , " she says . " I 'd hand it over to my business manager , and he would proceed to lose most of it . " She still owned a house and that was about it . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was breakaway time  --  the moment to withdraw and effect a total transformation , to sharpen the skills with which to come battling back . An adult she was in years , and an adult she would be on thescreen  --  or nothing , she resolved . Putting her house on the market ( " I had to in order to survive " ) , she moved into a smaller place and , for the next two years turning down the few television job offers she got , threw herself into a regimen of dramatic training such as most actresses experience at the beginning of their careers . Name any well-known coach on the West Coast who teaches speech , movement , music or dance ; Sally studied with that person in addition to her slavish attendance at classes of the Hollywood branch of Actors Studio . Daring to gamble on herself , she won . The first proof of this came on two successive nights in November 1976 in " Sybil , " a four-hour teledrama . Sally Field held the nation spellbound while she gave a dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities . Winning an Emmy as Sybil confirmed the wisdom of her decision to make a fresh start in her career . And , three seasons later , there was Norma Rae . This blockbuster movie , about a Southern mill worker spearheading a violent union battle , made Sally Field the only Hollywood actress in history to win , in one year , not only the Academy Award but also the Best Actress awards given by the National Society of Film Critics , the New York Film Critics , the National Board of Review , the Los Angeles Film Critics Association , the Golden Globe organization and the Cannes Film Festival . The night Norma Rae was shown at the Cannes competition was a time of high excitement for Sally . When the lights went up , the audience leaped to its feet and , screaming praise for the movie and its star , applauded thunderously for 20 minutes . " I was thinking that it was my dream come true , " Sally says of the occasion . When I was a kid I never dreamed about going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie awake and dream of having bravos and a standing ovation . And I was thinking to myself , now I have had it . " It seems a very long time ago , " she adds , smiling . " A lot has happened in the past year , all terrific . But Cannes was the first intimation that anything like that was ever going to happen in my life . I knew in my heart that I was ready but I did n't know when  --  or if  --  it would come . Norma Rae might never have been . But God was with me , fate was with me and Martin Ritt ( who directed her in both Norma Rae and Back Roads ) was with me . So Norma Rae happened . And my whole life changed . " One might remark that she herself has n't changed . Sally is quick to correct this . " But I have changed , in ways you ca n't see , " she insists . " At 34 , I 'm still growing , changing a lot inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I do n't have any answers . I find myself saying , ' I do n't know , ' quite a lot , and I prefer it this way . It 's like the lyrics of that old song  --  it was Bob Dylan 's , was n't it ? ? ' I was older then ; I 'm younger than that now . ' That 's the way I feel . Even though I looked younger then , during all those television days of " Gidget " and " The Flying Nun " I felt like a very old person inside . " Being an object of ridicule was hurtful . It drove me inward , made me devise ways to hide and protect myself . For an actress , nothing could be more damaging , unless it 's surrendering to such reactions as ' I hate them , I 'll show them and someday I 'll repay them , ' which I did for a while . But bitterness eats you up , destroys all the good parts of you . Besides , it was n't ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . It just happened . So I have learned to turn anger and hostility into something positive . When I 'm overcome by these emotions now , I use them in acting class or a work situation . I let them push me into trying things I 'd be too scared to attempt otherwise . And , when you expose yourself that way as a performer , when you risk being thought foolish or bad , those are the times when you learn the most and go the greatest distance . " The roles she 's played in " Sybil , " Back Roads and especially Norma Rae have also changed her , Sally volunteers . " Elements of these characters become forever a part of me , " she says . " I work so personally , from the inside out , that it changes me . I do n't come back the same . And Norma definitely did that to me . I would like to be more like her . " One of the least attractive things about me is that I 've always tried to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about what 's ' out there . ' Are there injustices ? Is there an energy shortage ? How about the possibility of war in the Mideast ? My reaction has always been , ' What can I do ? Not my fault . I do n't want to know . ' I plead guilty . Now I do want to know . I 've begun to come out of my lazy cocoon and say , ' Wait a minute . Let me find out about this . Let me read about it , know what 's happening . Let me grasp the problem . Let me see what can be done . ' " One reason for this lack of involvement , she explains , was that she " could never ' see ' people very well " ? as a group , as a society or even as individuals . " Something in me wanted to stay hidden . I did n't want to be around people . It 's a person ? Tell it to go away . A dog ? Let the dog in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I just put them on hold . " The reason for this was almost assuredly her instant stardom in her teens , instant marriage ( when not quite 22 ) and instant motherhood ( her first child arrived 14 months later ) , followed by heavy responsibilities complicated by emotional , financial and career woes . When was there ever time before to give a thought to others ? Going further back , the environment in which she has lived all her life must also be considered . Sally Field is what 's called a " Hollywood brat , " in the tradition of Jane Fonda , Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra , Jr. ? kids who grew up in the shadow of an acting parent in her case both her mother , actress Margaret Field , and stepfather , Jock Mahoney ) and knew from childhood they were destined to become performers . This background made for a certain personal insularity and single-minded concentration on self . " All my life , " says Sally , " ever since I was a tiny child , I knew I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't sound vain , but I knew I had a gift . I did n't ask for it . God gave it to me ; I was born with it . But many people are born with a gift and either throw it away or let it defeat them . I made up my mind very early to cultivate mine , to make it flourish . " I took lessons of every kind  --  dancing , acting , whatever . I was in every school play . I lived in the movie theaters and really studied the films I saw . I knew that movie acting would be as natural as breathing to me . My favorite movie of all time is Gone With the Wind . I 've seen it countless times and it never fails to enthrall me with its emotional power . When I was about nine , it shaped the way I feel about film  --  that while a piece of film is not a living thing , it never dies . I went to my mother then , when I 'd already seen it 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture always moved me and affected my whole personality and thinking . ' I 'm going to be a movie actress , ' I told her . ' I want to be able to touch people long after I 'm no longer around . ' With all this yearning going on inside me and all that preparation to become an actress , I was as ready as I could be when I was discovered as a teen-ager . " Sally was only four when her mother , a promising newcomer at Paramount , divorced Sally 's father ( pharmaceutical manufacturer Richard D. Field ) and married Jock Mahoney , a cowboy star who twice played Tarzan in movies . The youngster realized early on how much both her mother and stepfather loved their work , as well as that what they did for a living was work . This dual observation caused her to link her inborn affection for make-believe to an acceptance that hard work necessarily accompanied it . Of her mother , who now lives with Sally and her children in Laurel Canyon , she has said : She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting classes with Charles Laughton . And she was always reciting Shakespeare to me . I 'm sure I did n't understand any of it at that age , but what was communicated was this immense love of what she was doing . " Obviously immune to the " acting bug , " Sally 's older brother , Rick Field , now 36 , became a physicist . But her half-sister , Princess Mahoney , 25 , is presently trying her wings in show business . Interestingly , in one of Sally 's recent movies , The End , she was supported by all three acting members of the Mahoney family  --  Maggie , Jock and Princess , who , at 5 ' 8 " , towers over Sally but on whom the petite star dotes nonetheless . Harking back to the recent changes in her life , Sally said , " As you know , I 've always been a very singular person . A loner . Now , for the first time since high school , when I had one close girl friend , I have a friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , Judy Steinberg , who was traveling with her . When after a few minutes Judy excused herself and went to another room of the suite and was out of earshot , Sally happily reported : " Judy is just a very rare lady . I 've known her and her husband David for almost four years now , but only in the last couple of years have we become such close friends . It 's been a gradual process of us getting to know each other by degrees , step by step . " After so many years of not having one , I did n't know how to have a friend . I admitted to her I did n't know what was expected . I would ask her : ' What does a friend do ? What do you do with them ? How do you use it ? Do you spend the night ? ' That was where I had left off  --  when you had slumber parties . " So Judy taught me . That you call when you feel like it but you keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . That it 's okay to change your mind at the last minute or cancel a dinner appointment . I did n't know that . I thought you had to be what ' they ' wanted you to be all the time  --  and if that was the case , well , no , thank you , I 'd rather stay home forever . " Judy , " she continues , " is eleContinued on page 88 Sally Field continued from page 69 gant in a most unpretentious way . She is very sophisticated in areas where I feel inferior , like clothes and behavior . You know , when you 're 34 years old and have had no real social life , being busy making a living or rearing children , you become frightened . You 're afraid to make a move  --  terrified that you 're going to look foolish , wear the wrong clothes , say the improper thing because , emotionally , you 're still 18 years old . " Judy has helped me get past all this . Without being aggressive , she has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just ' kind of there , ' very close , and I 'm grateful for that and prize her friendship like a rare jewel . A friend , I know now , fills up something in your life that no one else , not a husband or a lover , can fill . " Sally 's friend is the wife of comedy star David Steinberg . And , besides being a leading nightclub performer and screenwriter , David Steinberg is , interestingly , both the close friend and business partner of Burt Reynolds . Recently , forming Reynolds-Steinberg Productions , they entered into an exclusive , two-year agreement with ABC-TV to do network specials in which each will star , develop series pilots and make a motion picture for television , all of which they will co-produce . And , after four years of being together , Sally and Burt Reynolds have lately decided to go their separate ways . Burt , as gossip columnists put it , is " seeing others . " She is n't . The Reynolds-Field romance was reported ad nauseam in the tabloids , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may well have hastened its demise . And while it was ongoing , Sally admits , she became thoroughly fed up with snooping reporters . " Sometimes , " she says , " I was asked questions I found so offensive that I 'd want to pop the person in the nose , and I usually said that ? ' I ' d like to pop you right in the facer It was kind of a challenge , really  --  a challenge as to how well I could handle it , how I could remain honest and not go against my own integrity , not do or say what I did n't want to and not get angry . Mostof the time I feel I managed it well . " It was Burt Reynolds who , after seeing her on TV in " Sybil " and without having even met her , phoned and insisted she costar with him in Smokey and the Bandit , the hilarious , 120-minute automotive chase that became a monster hit at the box office in 1977 . That success gave Sally Field 's resurgent movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rae . She still gets misty-eyed at the mention of Reynolds ' name and gives him full credit for paving the way for all the screen opportunities still coming to her . After Back Roads , there will be Absence of Malice , which Sydney Pollack will produce and direct . That will be followed by two more for producer-director Martin Ritt , Mixed Feelings and No Small Affair , in which she 'll portray a Greenwich Village blues singer involved with a 15-yearold boy . In all , she and Burt Reynolds costarred in four comedies : Smokey and the Bandit , Hooper , The End and the recent Smokey and the Bandit IL " I will always feel indebted to Burt , " Sally says . " The movies I did with him helped me in many ways . They literally changed producers ' ideas about me . Before , the motion-picture industry did n't see me as being any kind of presence on the screen at all . The pictures also helped to show that I do n't look or act like Sybil , that I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else , they helped feed my children while I was getting my foot in the door . " You do not have to be around Sally Field long to discover that her children , Peter and Eli , are the true center of her existence . " I share my life with them , " she told me , " because I ask them to share their lives with me . I do n't treat them as ' little adults , ' nor do I expect them to act like that , but we do have a very open , honest relationship . They know what goes on in my life and I know what goes on in theirs . We feed into one another . I think I get my strength from them . When I 'm away on location and they are n't with me , I call my children every night . Not just for them  --  for me . Because I need to be plugged in . I need my intravenous feeding . Talking with them has a calming effect on me . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think I would go bananas . Their very existence takes me out of the business and puts everything else in perspective . So you make a mistake and do the wrong movie . Who cares  --  what does it really matter ? " Sally laughs and adds : " Talk about reality , kids have a genius for putting you right in the middle of it . At least mine do . Recently , after twice seeing Xanadu , which many critics did n't like and he simply loved , Peter argued that people should be more willing to accept the good things in a film and less eager to tear it apart . ' There 's something wrong with every single movie , ' he said . There were things wrong with Norma Rae . ' When I demanded to know what , he answered , ' It was boring ! ' " Sometimes now , she says , she overhears her boys talking about awards , boasting that they 're going to win this one or that when they grow up . " When I hear these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress on them that even though it 's nice to win , that 's not the real issue . The important thing to go after is the thrill , the work thrill , because you do n't get that from anyone else  --  you get that from yourself . " Now that she has won both an Oscar and an Emmy , Sally admits she would eventually like to go for a Broadway // Tony . " I 've done several things on stage in different places ( including The Rainmaker with Burt Reynolds at his theater in Florida ) , but I would love to do experimental work like Meryl Streep does , " she says . " I have the greatest admiration for her . Unfortunately , you have to live in New York , and I feel I ca n't take my children to live there now . But someday I will do it . I 'll write Joseph Papp a letter saying , If you ever run across a part for a small person with puffy cheeks , I 'll send you my resume . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be produced by her own company in which she will star . First off the launching pad will be Revelations , for which Waldo Salt is now writing a screenplay . Based on the novel by Phyllis Naylor , it focuses on people in a small Maryland town during a fundamental religious revival meeting . The actress describes it as a " story of relationships ( her favorite kind of film ) ? no message , no political overtones  --  about a spinster and a jazzy con-man evangelist who comes to town and changes her life . " Meanwhile the changes continue in Sally Field 's own life . " I 've taken a couple of good steps , " Sally says , " but success or having a good career is n't taking a couple of good steps . It 's having run 25 miles and looking back and saying , ' Ah , I stumbled a couple of times , but all in all , I 'm pretty proud of my work . ' I 'm proud of Smokey and the Bandit . I 'm proud of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others  --  it was like treading water . " Right now , " she continues , " I am in a state of transition , in the process of becoming , of finding out who I am . It 's a luxury I never had before . And it touches all parts of my being . Now I have the opportunity to choose the sort of work I want to do , to work with the kind of people I want to work with , to present myself as I see myself to the press , to the movie industry , to the world , with my children , as a single parent , as a single woman in the world . To live and grow , that 's the most exciting thing of all . " Then , with an impish twinkle in shining brown eyes , Sally adds : " Next time you talk to me , 1 may be a whole other person .
