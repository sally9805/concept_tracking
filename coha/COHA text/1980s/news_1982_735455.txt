txt This is the place on the banks of the Yazoo River that gave America actress Stella Stevens , comedian Jerry Clower , writer Willie Morris and lawyer Haley Barbour . Haley Barbour ? It 's actually pronounced Haleybarbour , with no pause between the given name and the surname and with the voice sort of sliding downhill . Mr. Barbour is 34 years old , 40 pounds lighter than he was a year ago and a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate . He is aiming to displace a Mississippi legend , Democrat John Stennis , the 81-year-old dean of the Senate , a man of courtly manners and rugged ethics who was held public office for 54 years . It is clearly the toughest challenge Sen. Stennis has ever faced  --  because he never has had a real challenge since he was elected to the Senate in 1947 after the death of Sen. Theodore Bilbo , one of the era 's bestknown racial demagogues . And so the " battlin ' lawyer " from De Kalb ( pronounced de-CAB ) , who began his public career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1928 , has opened a campaign headquarters in Jackson crammed with computers and word processors . He has even hired a well-known poll taker , Peter Hart , and a media expert , Raymond Strother . " You 've got to be modern , " says Sen. Stennis , with a broad smile . If Mr. Stennis is elected to the Senate for the seventh time and if he serves his full sixyear term  --  reaching the age of 87 ? he would become one of the two or three oldest men ever to serve in that body . " The odds are against him , " says an insensitive Republican here . " He 'd be fighting the actuarial tables . " Not many Mississippians thought that Mr. Stennis would run again this year . They cited James Eastland , ? who in 1978 was more or less forced into retirement at the age of 74 after 36 years in the Senate . But Mr. Stennis fooled everybody and plunged in . He likes to quote from a speech that he made in his first campaign . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the V*. row . This is my political religion , and I John Stennis have lived by it too long to abandon it now . " Some Republicans whisper that Mr. Stennis is running again only to keep his Senate seat warm for his old friend . Gov . William Winter . The idea is that Mr. Stennis would step down in a year or two and the governor would succeed him . But Mr. Winter denies it , and state election laws make such a succession difficult . Undbubtedly , Mr. Stennis was under some pressure to ? run again because the Democrats could n't find an attractive candidate take his place . They also feared that the Republicans might run their strongest candidate , U.S. Rep. Trent Lott , the Republican whip . But Sen. Stennis says the simplest explanation is that " I just could n't find a stopping place . " Once , of course , ? John Stennis was a giHaley Barbour ant In the Senate . He was chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1969 until Republicans won control of the Senate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . During his years as chairman , his campaign brochure says , " more than 50 new weapons systems were authorized . " The media experts who wrote his brochure were inspired to add , " The soldier with mud on his boots and the sailor with salt on his face know that John Stennis ? stands for them . " He was also the chairman ( and after 1980 , an influential member ) of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee . From that post , he - watched over the development of his pet public-works project , the $2 billion Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway , a 232-mile barge canal that Is supposed , to run from northeastern . Mississippi to Mobile , Ma. , on the Gulf Coast . Environmentalists call it a " boondoggle " and have come closer and closer to killing it , even though it 's now almost half-.finished . Supporters of the waterway held a fundraiser for Mr. Stennis 's campaign the other day at the International Tradg Club in Mobile . The senator was in fine fettle . He recalled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mobile and that his mother 's baby shoes were bought in Mobile . " That was the test , " he said . " They had to come from Mobile . " Getting serious , he said now 's the real test for the waterway . " If we can get the appropriation this year . it will be cheaper to finish it than to kill it off . " He said the waterway would win , but the vote would be close . " it will be a great national asset , " he promised . The people who came to hear him ? dropped off 3250 checks for his Campaign as they left . Mr. Stennis 's opponent , Mr. Barbour , has never been elected anything . " He has no experience , " Mr. Stennis says . " None . " But Mr. Barbour , for all that , is no pushover . He is one of that growing band of young technocrats who specialize in running political campaigns . Nine years ago , when he was 25 , he was the executive director of Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for U.S. Rep. Thad Cochran in his successful campaign to succeed Mr. Eastland in the Senate . He was President Ford 's Southeastern campaign director in the 1976 presidential election . He worked for John Connally 's presidential campaign in 1980 ( but does n't like to talk about it ) . He knows all about polls and media markets and voter targeting . His major issue is that it 's time for a " senator for the ' 80s . " Now 's a good time to make the change , Mr. Barbour says , because the Republicans control the Senate . " The only senator from Mississippi who 's chairman of anything . is Thad Cochran , " Mr. Barbour says . ( Mr. Cochran heads the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee . He was a three-term House member when he ran for the Senate . ) Another Age Issue Mr. Hart , the Stennis poll taker , says , " The only real issue in the campaign is , Should Mississippi send a boy to Washington to do a man 's job ? " Mr. Barbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brash . " I 'm just a year younger than Jim Eastland was when he went to the Senate in 1941 , " Mr. Barbour says . He insists that he is better qualified than anyone who might have been a mayor or a state legislator . " I 've had to know about these issues to run state and national campaigns , " he says . Mr. Barbour says that his polls show that although Mr. Stennis remains popular , voters generally think that it 's time for a change . Mr. Hart says Sen. Stennis has one of the highest job ratings anywhere . " There is no candidate running in 1982 who would n't trade his rating for John Stennis 's , " Mr. Hart contends . Mr. Barbour hits hard at Sen. Stennis 's refusal to take him on in debate . But Rex Buffington .. the senator 's press secretary . sees no sense in that . " Why , " he asks , " should we give our opponent exposure he really could n't get on his own ? " Besides , Mr. Buffington says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agrees with Sen. Stennis 's philosophy . " Civil-Rights Record Mr. Barbour and his campaign strategists like to note that in his long Senate career , Mr. Stennis voted 130 or 140 times against civilrights legislation . Then , earlier this year . Mr. Stennis voted the other way the first time ? in favor of extending the Voting Rights Act , the landmark legislation that changed the political face of Mississippi . Before passage of the act , only 7% of Mississippi 's blacks were registered to vote . Now , almost 70% are registered , and a black man , Robert Clark , is the Democratic candidate for Congress in the Second District . He is given a chance to win . But Mr. Barbour does n't say he would have voted or behaved differently from Mr. Stennis . Some polls indicate that black voters may give an edge to Mr. Stennis in November . The only real dust-up in the campaign so far occurred early in August at the state 's biggest political event , . the Neshoba County Fair . When Mr. Stennis arrived there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign colors and his own logo that said , " Happy 81st Birthday , Sen. Stennis . " The Stennis people swear that they were deeply hurt by the display , which they suspect was arranged by the Barbour campaign . " We were so disappointed , " says Mr. Buffington , the senator 's press secretary . " We believed them when they said they would n't raise the ( age ) issue . " Mr. Barbour and his aides insist that they know nothing about the banner .
