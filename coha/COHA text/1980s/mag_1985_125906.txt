A matchup between the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the country will turn a coach 's hair gray , and a sloppy early-season game between them , like last Saturday 's Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic in Springfield , Mass. , will turn a gray-haired coach 's head grayer still . But of all the coifs in that not-so-titanic clash of titans , in which dapple-haired Bill Frieder 's Michigan Wolverines , No. 2 according to SI , muddled to a 49-44 win over silver-haired Bobby Cremins 's Georgia Tech Ramblin ' Wreck , SI 's No. 1 , the most compelling head of hair belonged to Michigan guard Antoine ( The Judge ) Joubert . It has been suggested that the Judge can Really Play . It has also been suggested that he is a gherri-curled , rat-tailed imposter . " The day we signed Antoine , " says Frieder , " I told my staff that there 'd be a lot of days we 'd live by Joubert , and a lot of days we 'd die by him . " // On Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitfully , the Judge 's 21-point performance amounted to a verdict of sorts . Yes , I can play . His coach may not think very highly of the little outcropping on the back of Joubert 's head , but ... " Antoine 's always worn it that way , " Frieder shrugs . " Hey , he 's Creole , and that 's the way they wear their hair . " // Joubert is also from Detroit , and here 's the way they play their ball : // First , for motivational purposes , take a little uptown woofing from the guy who 's guarding you . In this case it was Tech 's Harlem-bred defensive ace , Bruce Dalrymple . " That 's two ! " Dalrymple reminded Joubert late in the first half , after the Judge had traveled under pressure from Dalrymple and his backcourt mate , Mark Price , to give up the ball yet one more time . // Next , deal back a little Motown woofing of your own . " You sit down , " said Hizzoner , this after Dalrymple picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes old . // Then Joubert took advantage of Dalrymple 's absence by schooling Craig Neal , Tech 's backup guard , three times on short jump shots to help the Wolverines slingshot their way from six points back into a tie . // Finally , he got in the last word with a couple of free throws in the final minute , won the game MVP award and still exchanged pleasantries with Dalrymple afterward . " All that verbal stuffs part of the game , " said the Judge . // So , too , are first halves like the one Michigan suffered through . Helped by the upper-class play of 6 ' 8 " freshman forward Tom Hammonds , who would finish with 14 points and eight rebounds , the Yellow Jackets appeared to be anticipating the Wolverines ' every move . Price and Dalrymple repeatedly jumped out on Joubert and Gary ( The General ) Grant and fleeced them of the ball . John Salley , Tech 's 7-foot center , took swipes at the soft offerings of Roy Tarpley , the Wolverines ' All-America pivotman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot was n't blocked outright , some masochistic Techster would be there to draw a charge on any reckless ' Rine who dared shoot on the move . First it was Hammonds who drew an offensive foul , then the 166-pound Neal , then forward Duane Ferrell , whose own tail Cremins tolerates , possibly because Ferrell insists it 's an " antenna , " necessary for clear communication with the coach . // Michigan went into the locker room trailing 25-17 , but even though the Wolverines had shot 18% , they were still very much in the game . They just had to make a slight strategic adjustment . Charged with implementing that change was the Judge , who , according to legend , earned his handle at Detroit 's Southwestern High for his ability to bring order to the court . " In the first half , we 'd call a play and they 'd be right there , " Joubert said . " So we changed it up . We started reading screens , going the opposite way from what the play had called for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complementary guards : Some pairs are in more delicate sync than others . Price shot miserably , coming up short on jumper after jumper , including two air balls . After Dalrymple fouled out with 2:34 remaining , Price was reduced to forcing poor shots , finishing 2 for 13. // Price had outplayed such fine guards as Syracuse 's Pearl Washington , Duke 's Johnny Dawkins and Illinois 's Bruce Douglas last season , and Grant , aware of that , savored the challenge . " I 'm going to let y'all do the writing and everything , " Grant told the press before the game . " But yes , sir , I 'll guard Price . I 'll try to deny him the ball . The rest is up to him . I just hope he 's missing his shot . " Then he added , as if dictating a press release : " He 's like a general out there  --  my nickname . " Grant 's defensive prowess went a long way toward easing the embarrassment of his own 0-for-10 shooting performance . // Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 ) and missed shots ( there were  --  pass the mortar and trowel , please  --  69 bricks ) could indeed be ascribed to brilliantly executed defenses . At least that 's the way Frieder preferred to see the contest . " It does n't look like one to the public , because they do n't understand defense , " Frieder said , " but it was a great basketball game . " The Yellow Jackets held Michigan to 31.1% shooting , but lost because they shot just 29.6% from the field and 52% from the line themselves . They did , however , take with them the knowledge that they can bang with the best of the Big Ten . As Salley says , " The only way you learn how to fight is by getting beat up . " // As for the Wolverines , their sluggishness could be laid to everything from jet lag  --  they had opened their season with two tough games in Hawaii  --  to the first-stringers ' disorienting experience of having freshmen show them up all week in practice . The regulars had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from their coach , none more than Joubert. // Says Frieder , " I got on his tail . "
