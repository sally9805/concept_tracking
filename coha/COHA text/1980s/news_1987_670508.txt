" // // Austrian Envoy Recalled // In response to the Administration ' s action , the Austrian Government recalled to Vienna its Ambassador to the United States , Thomas Klestil. // Mr. Waldheim ' s record as a lieutenant in the German Army from 1942 to 1945 became an issue during his campaign for the largely ceremonial office of President a year ago .

Much of the other information found by the Justice Department added details that strengthened the case against him , the sources said. // A spokesman for the Austrian Embassy , Walter Greinert , said that Ambassador Klestil had been preparing to leave for a new post in Austria , but that he was being called home immediately " for consultations " in reaction to the Justice Department ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Klestil had a " really friendly " conversation with President Reagan , Mr. Greinert said .

" <> <> ' History Has Caught Up ' // The action was applauded by a broad range of American Jewish organizations. // " History has at last caught up with Kurt Waldheim , " said the general counsel of the World Jewish Congress , Eli Rosenbaum , who directed its investigation of Mr. Waldheim for over a year. // Edgar M. Bronfman , president of the World Jewish Congress , said : " The findings today confirm that Kurt Waldheim is and remains the symbol of deception and deceit in the world. " // Although Jewish groups had been pressing the Administration to take action against Mr. Waldheim , a Justice Department official involved in the case asserted today that political factors were not considered in the decision . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the official said. // A Justice Department official said the broad outlines of the case against Mr. Waldheim had been discovered last year in the National Archives in Washington by the department and the World Jewish Congress , which conducted its own inquiry . In addition , more detailed information was found late last year when Neal Sher , director of the Office of Special Investigations , went to Yugoslavia to examine the archives there. // These were the activities in which the department said it found Mr. Waldheim had taken part : // * The transfer of civilian prisoners to the SS for exploitation as slave labor. // * The mass deportation of civilians - among them Jews from the Greek islands and the town of Banja Luka , Yugoslavia - to concentration and death camps. // * The use of anti-Semitic propaganda. // * The turning over of Allied prisoners to a branch of the SS. // * Reprisal executions of hostages and other civilians . <> <> Served With Army Group E // In 1943 , a department official said , Mr. Waldheim was responsible for assisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population through mass deportations and reprisal executions.

Shultz , Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott , and Abraham D. Sofaer , the State Department ' s legal adviser. // The list Mr. Waldheim was put on today is an Immigration and Naturalization Service list called a watch list alerting agents at borders to watch for certain people. // The State Department announced that it was also putting Mr. Waldheim into its " automated visa lookout system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a visa to enter this country. // In a statement , the Justice Department said that its action was based on a law that excludes anyone who under Nazi direction " ordered , initiated , assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of race , religion , national origin or political opinion. " // The action placing Mr. Waldheim on the watch list affects him as an " individual , " Justice Department officials said . If he sought permission to enter this country for a state visit , as an Austrian leader , a decision on how to respond would have to be made by the White House and the State Department. // Were he to try to enter the country as an individual , he would be held for an exclusion hearing , at which the burden would be on Mr. Waldheim to convince the Justice Department that he should be permitted to enter the country. // Mr. Greinert said Mr. Waldheim had no plans to make any trips to the United States. // The Justice Department said that " efforts by a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been regarded as significant " in determining whether to place a person on the watch list. // A senior department official said it had found " inconsistencies " in Mr. Waldheim ' s account of his wartime activities. //
