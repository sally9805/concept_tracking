Why does this happen so regularly ? Why do the follow-up efforts of smart , up-and-coming young film makers so often go awry ? There ' s no real way for those of us on the viewing end of this process to know what pressures and blandishments are brought to bear upon young talent , but we begin to imagine . Let ' s say film maker X now has a more ambitious project , and that as a sign of good faith , a large studio has given him ( or her ) a pair of $6 million stars . What if the leading lady has an expensive wardrobe , makeup and hairdressing team that comes with her , in her own special trailer ? What if the leading man refuses to stay in a Holiday Inn and opts for something more grand ? // Suppose that a few old friends wind up on the payroll in various capacities - driver , co-screenwriter , perhaps even associate producer - and that everyone has a personal assistant or two . This may leave X , who previously worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million budget , a 44-day shooting schedule and an awful lot of people looking over his shoulder . If a single day ' s work goes badly , he can go to bed knowing that he ' s just cost somebody half a million dollars . That might be two or three times the cost of his entire first feature , which he made at his own pace , in his own way , under circumstances that were infinitely more serene. // Spike Lee , whose new " School Daze " shows every sign of having suffered from this syndrome ( its $6 million budget is roughly three dozen times that of his earlier " She ' s Got ta Have It " ) , says that he made exactly the film he wanted to make , which is an indication of just how insidious such fiscal seductions can be . The idea for " School Daze , " about tensions between black students who are true to their cultural heritage and others who aspire to whiter tastes and values , is certainly as daring as the conception of " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Mr. Lee ' s execution is noticeably less assured . His earlier film was funny , sexy , single-minded and enjoyably small , but " School Daze " is constantly shifting gears . Its satirical tone seems to come and go . And it includes lengthy , elaborate musical numbers that are well beyond the range of Mr. Lee ' s technical abilities . " She ' s Got ta Have It " may not have aimed this high , but on the other hand it hit its mark. // But should Mr. Lee , whose cleverness is still unmistakable here , be faulted for not knowing how to stage song-and-dance routines ? Should the Argentinian-born director Hector Babenco , who had to his credit both an extremely promising early film ( " Pixote " ) and an absolute triumph ( " Kiss of the Spider Woman " ) be blamed for not knowing enough about Albany or America ' s Great Depression ? If Mr. Babenco truly believed that he was the man for the $23 million job of bringing William Kennedy ' s novel " Ironweed " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , when a director used to working on a smaller scale , like Mr. Babenco or Joyce Chopra ( " Smooth Talk " ) , moves on to the major leagues and runs into trouble ( Miss Chopra was replaced early in the filming of the forthcoming " Bright Lights , Big City " ) , how can anyone be surprised ? // As part of an industry that assumes bigger must be better , artists like these are inevitably caught in a bind . Hollywood is a place , after all , where producers of already-overpriced productions will sometimes exaggerate these costs even further , thinking a $35 million film sounds better than a $30 million one . It ' s a place where a Michael Cimino can claim a reputation as a major film maker because , and only because , he knows how to squander major sums of money . And the process by which young talent must attract big money to be taken seriously is as much a part of other fields ( publishing , for instance ) as it is of film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an enthusiastically received first book to a second that ' s brought in much more money and isn ' t nearly as good . It ' s endemic to our culture to think that cost is commensurate with quality , so insisting on these higher fees is only part of the process , even if it ' s the part that creates impossibly high stakes . Only the very brave artist - or the very unfashionable one - winds up flying in the face of this wisdom. // Robert Altman , who once exemplified American film making at its most innovative and now barely works on its fringes , has lately been directing " Tanner ' 88 , " a limited-run Home Box Office series about a fictitious Presidental candidate played by Michael Murphy . The idea is to have Mr. Murphy ' s Jack Tanner keep pace with the real campaign and be seen shaking hands with everyone from Gary Hart to Pat Robertson while staging his own very deadpan assault on the electorate . The teaming of Mr. Altman and Garry Trudeau , who has written this material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guess which contribution is whose ( as when , in the first episode , Tanner made a speech about the beauties of New Hampshire just as a group of snowmobiles came over the hill ) . But in any case , this show has shades of the loose , zany humor and subtle gravity that marked the Altman style at its " Nashville " best. // But these programs are being made on a budget of $700 , 000 per one-hour episode . They ' re shot on videotape , which makes the hazy , quizzical Altman camera style look slightly harsh and makes his trademark overlapping dialogue sometimes inaudible . It ' s impossible to watch " Tanner ' 88 " without wondering what the full-blown , pricier version might have looked like . The fact is that if Mr. Altman makes a success of this , he may well be asked to do something more expensive , and he ' d be crazy not to , despite the greater pressures that a higher budget would bring . Like it or not , fiscal affirmation is , for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she commands sufficient respect and is managing to stay afloat. // Surely there ' s some middle ground between sticking to the shoestring budget and moving on to direct a $40 million " Star Trek VII . " It may be that the best thing a young film maker can hope for is the chance to move sideways within the present system , and not just up . Jonathan Demme , for instance , has had his well-publicized troubles with the studios over the titling of one film ( " Citizens Band , " changed to " Handle With Care " ) and the final cut of another ( " Swing Shift " ) , and he has also done some of his best work outside the mainstream. // His three-film winning streak with " Stop Making Sense , " " Something Wild " and " Swimming to Cambodia " constituted an amazing show of reasonably low-budget virtuosity , and even his very forthright hourlong television documentary about Haiti made a strong impression ; sometime in the future , Mr. Demme is scheduled to film " Continental Drift , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel . Like Jim Jarmusch , another American maverick , Mr. Demme has won the right to make expensive , big-star productions using certifiably surefire material , but he chooses to do other things instead. // Hollywood doesn ' t condemn this kind of behavior , but it doesn ' t reward it either . It simply proffers that apple to each bright new contender who comes along . With any luck , though , some of that new talent won ' t bite. //
