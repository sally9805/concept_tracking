Peggy Leppik will never forget the day in 1983 when she opened the front door of her house in suburban Golden Valley , Minn. , and found three Minneapolis police detectives waiting outside . Someone with a home computer and modem had tapped into the computer of a Minneapolis bank by telephone , and police had traced the calls to her 14-year-old son Peter . " My heart stopped , " she says . " But I was confident from the beginning that he had n't done anything malicious . I have lots of faith and trust in Peter . " No charges were filed against Leppik , and his mother 's faith was dramatically rewarded last week when his latest exploits brought strangers of another sort to her door : reporters and camera crews eager to learn how the precocious lad , now 15 , had become a hacker hero , helping the Minneapolis police in a case against a suspected child molester . <P> Last month a 37-year-old Minneapolis computer programmer was arrested on charges of sexual misconduct with a 13-year-old boy . In the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model III computer and several dozen floppy disks , which they suspected might contain incriminating evidence . The suspect , however , had " locked " his disks with a special software program . Only someone who knew his six-letter password , which he refused to reveal , could read the information they contained . <P> The police department 's resident computer expert , Officer Robert Huber , was not familiar with the Radio Shack computer system , but knew someone who might be : Peter Leppik , whom he had met during the bank escapade and since befriended . After all the unfavorable stories about computer kids , says Huber , " it seemed like an ideal time to have a young person like Peter do something positive for the community . " <P> The police drove Leppik to a nearby Radio Shack store , which had offered the use of one of its machines . It took him less than half an hour to familiarize himself with the TRS-80 disk operating system , the master program that tells a computer how to store and retrieve data . Says Leppik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I could get the password by trying to guess it , so I had to find a way around it . " After loading the data from an operating system disk ( used for such housekeeping chores as making back-up copies of valuable disks ) into the computer , he placed a disk belonging to the suspect in one of the machine 's disk drives , and a blank disk in the other . He then called up the operating system 's menu , which lists on the screen all of the commands the system responds to . One after another , he typed the commands into the computer . When he typed BACKUP , the computer responded by asking for the unknown password . The same thing happened when he typed COPY . <P> Finally , Leppik tried CONVERT , a program that Radio Shack distributed in 1982 when it introduced a new version of its operating system . It converts files written under the old version to the format used by the new one . But , as Leppik discovered , Radio Shack had neglected to build into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command CONVERT , the computer whirred obediently , picking up the data from the locked disk and transferring it in the new format to a blank disk . From there , Leppik was able to retrieve it and display it on the screen . Only 45 minutes had elapsed from the time he entered the store .
