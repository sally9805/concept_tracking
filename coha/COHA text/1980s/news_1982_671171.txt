Three out of every four of Zambia ' s six million people profess adherence to one Christian church or another , and Livingstone is still venerated in the town named after him , at the Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River , and in the modest shrine to the north where he finally succumbed to disease , thousands of miles from home. // But the legacy , these days , of the early evangelists is tainted by schisms and debates among their successors that have pitted , in one case , a black laity against white clerics , and , in others , have brought allegations of misdeeds , sorcery and illicit liaisons among the priesthood. // The divisions are such , according to an analyst of church affairs , that a threat has arisen of a formal schism between Zambia ' s Roman Catholics and the Vatican that would add to the ranks of southern Africa ' s 2 , 000 separatist churches . <> <> Africa ' s Spiritual Realities // The debate has also evoked the wider conflict between the forms of religion imposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner perceived as more suited to the continent ' s spiritual realities. // The divisions opened in April when Zambia ' s first black Archbishop , Emmanuel Milingo , was recalled to Rome for what the Vatican called " theological studies and quiet reflection . " Rome also ordered the cleric to undergo a medical examination. // His departure from Lusaka was the culmination of four years of controversy over the Archbishop ' s faith-healing sessions , his casting out of devils and reports of his speaking in " tongues " during exorcism ceremonies . The predominantly white Catholic priesthood , Rome itself and the Pope ' s personal ambassador here , it seems , believed that the Archbishop ' s espousal of the " charismatic renewal " movement within the church had led him across the divide between Catholicism and witchcraft. // Some priests referred to the cleric ' s activities as " mumbo jumbo " and sorcery , but the interpretation of his recall among the black laity was that the Archbishop had fallen victim to Rome ' s refusal to fully Africanize the church in a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the eyes of orthodox Catholics , might be perceived as a blending of the church rites with those of animism . <> <> Reportedly Held Incommunicado // The anger of Zambian Catholics mounted with reports that the Archbishop had been held incommunicado by the Vatican and with Rome ' s refusal thus far to make a full statement about the reasons for the cleric ' s return to Rome or about his future in the church. // Archbishop Milingo has made no secret of his desire to see the Church of Rome modified to accommodate African feeling . " The inferiority complex which haunts Africa is a perpetual humiliation which has come about by the historical colonialism in politics , economics and region , " he wrote in his book " Demarcations. " // " Till today , Africa is still judged through the colors of other people ' s glasses , " he said . " To convince me that I can only be a full Christian when I shall be well brought up in European civilization and culture is to force me to change my nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African , it is not yet evident. " // And in an interview published in London , the Archbishop said : " The attitude of Africa is not so much to do away with all that is Western , but to tell Europe that we also have some values , and inheritance that the Lord has given us . Anyone who is going to misinterpret the search for identity and authenticity of the Africans as racism , as discriminatory , is just being prejudiced . " <> <> Archbishop Denies Charges // Yet racism has crept into the debate with publication here of a report to the Vatican by two white priests charging improper behavior by the Archbishop in his faith-healing sessions . The cleric has denied the accusations. // So intense is the emotion generated by the debate that a letter written to his friends in England by a Protestant missionary , accusing his black brethren of being " rogues " of low moral standing , has rekindled sentiment that it is time for radical change in the Zambian church . Some Zambian churchmen are now seeking evidence to substantiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Zambian woman. // The problem , said Gabriel Chifwambwa , editor of The National Mirror , an ecumenical newspaper , is that there are few African clerics because of Rome ' s celibacy rules , and so the church is still dominated by foreigners. // Although several of Zambia ' s nine bishops are Africans , he said , the majority of the 150 priests in the Lusaka Archdiocese are white missionaries seen by some members of the laity as symbols of orthodox resistance to Africanization . <> <> No Status for the Celibate // What is required , Mr. Chifwambwa said , is an acknowledgment by the church of African culture , which sets great store by the creation of a family and accords no status to the celibate . Such change in Rome ' s thinking seems out of the question , particularly since the Pope has taken a strong position in favor of the celibacy of priests , and so the debate seems certain to simmer on. // Meanwhile , travelers will still be treated to scenes such as that , reported by a Westerner here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stammering through the liturgy in the local Chinyanja language , under roofs of thatch in distant villages - incongruous redeemers. // The debate is not restricted to Zambia and , in many parts of Africa , the church seems embroiled in a phenomenon common to those who conquer , only to find themselves slowly being assimilated into the manners of the conquered . Thus , in Zaire for instance , a churchgoer can see a Belgian clergyman , clad in a cap of monkey skins , leading acolytes who carry spears along with the cross and who equate the Christian saints with the ancestral spirits of animism. // The fear among the orthodox in Zambia seems to be that Africanization will permit the same blurring of distinctions . The confusion between the Christian belief and the animist reverence for the spirits already seems to have occurred . <> <> African and European Names // In a letter to The National Mirror , for example , a Zambian Catholic named M.M. Nshimbi , wrote recently that seminarians should not be required to abandon their African names in favor of European titles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ancestors " - an argument blending Catholicism and traditional African belief. // Neither does it seem , despite the statistics , that Christianity has displaced animism and sorcery totally among those who claim adherence to the foreign faiths. // A British consultant living here discovered the depths of traditional superstitions recently when , on returning from vacation , he found that his house had been ransacked by burglars . Invoking techniques ancient and modern , the consultant called in the police and a witch doctor , who came to his home , brewed a magical potion and insisted that the consultant ' s domestic staff be present during the rites that drew their strength and potency from the spirits. // Most of the staff went along with the idea , but one man , a night guard , became uneasy and wavered , substantiating , spiritually , the police detective ' s assertion that the crime had been an inside job. //
