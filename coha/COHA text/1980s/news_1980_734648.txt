txt INDIANAPOLIS  --  Janet Guthrie learned the hard way Sunday what others have learned before her : When you 're hying to qualify a car for the Indianapol0 500 , you 'd better get in while the eettin 's good . The only woman driver in the history of the famed race will be missing for the first time in four years Sunday when 33 drivers take off in mad &?uit; of gold and glory in the 500 's 64th running . Guthrie 's Texaco Star developed engine problems that kept her from even attempting a qualifying run on each of the last two Sundays . The irony is , however , that Guthrie could have been solidly ensconced in the fifth row if her crew had not waved her off less than a quarter mile from the end of her only qualifying attempt of the month . That came on pole day , when three consecutive laps of better than 184 miles an hour were deemed insufficient by her braintrust , that figured " she could do 2 or 3 miles an hour better . " GUTHRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an obvious bad decision . Dick Simon , Janet 's t e a mm a t e when she first came to the Speedway , made virtually the same mistake and acknowledged it as he finally sweated out a 10th-row appearance . " After turning down a 184 we just have to hope and pray this holds up , " he said after clocking only 132.788 Sunday . When he finally made the show he was five rows farther back than he would have been had he accepted the 184s he was running on the first day . While Guthrie and Simon were stewing over decisions that had gone sour , rookie Dick Ferguson was rejoicing over his team 's decision to stick with a first-day speed of less than 181 m.p.h . The decision was vindicated Sunday when Ferguson remained in the ' field ? in the fifth row , in fact  --  after all the shooting was over . It appears , however , that Ferguson 's decision to stand on a relatively low 182.880 was based on a faulty premise . ' II1S CREW CHIEF , Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ferguson , " and he reckoned that 10 miles an hour under the pole speed was safe . He said it has been that way for years and years , and there 's no reason this year should be any different . " So we had planned to stay with 1821/2 or better , and I 'm glad he stuck by his word . " Even so , Ferguson admitted that the night before the final qualifying session , " I started having second thoughts . I was ornery and jitter-buggy all night . " He might have been even more nervous had he checked the record books and discovered that in four of the last 10 years the spread had been less than 10 miles an hour . But it seldom has been less than 8 miles an hour , so Guthrie was giving up a run that even . at the time seemed certain to get her in the field . FOR HER MISFORTUNE , she will no doubt be given the infamous Jigger Sirois award , given each year to the driver who commits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rookie who was called off the track after three laps that , under rules of the day , would have put hint on the pole . He never again even made a qualifying attempt at Indianapolis . With Sunday 's failure , Guthrie 's career appears to be at rock bottom . She was scheduled to run only two races this year and admits , " I 'm unhappy about it . Any driver who thinks he can run only one or two races a year and still run up front is only fooling himself . I feel I 've proved I can run up front , but it 's difficult to land here the first of May and start working with people you 've never worked with and a car you 've never worked with . " It proved not only difficult , but impossible , and now her two-race sea . son is down to one . " I 'm unhappy about it . Any driver who thinks he can run only one or two races a year and still run up front is only fooling himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
