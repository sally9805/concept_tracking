Lt. Gov . George Ryan , a 16-year veteran of Statehouse politics , Monday declared his candidacy for secretary of state in the 1990 election , and promptly attacked a proposal by his likely Democratic opponent to require those convicted of drunken driving to display special license plates . At the same time , Ryan vowed to continue the campaign against drunk and drugged drivers that he said was launched by current Secretary of State Jim Edgar , who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor next year . Ryan said he strongly supports proposals to lower the legal definition of intoxication to a blood alcohol content of . 08 percent from the current . 10 percent . The Democratic race for attorney general , meanwhile , became even more crowded as Evanston attorney Jim Burns , a former assistant federal prosecutor , joined the field that already includes Comptroller Roland Burris and Sen. Dawn Clark Netsch of Chicago . Ryan ' s stance on drug and alcohol policies put him squarely at odds with Treasurer Jerome Cosentino , the Democratic candidate for secretary of state . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some compassion , they need some guidance , " said Ryan , who was introduced by Edgar , at a Capitol rally as a " man who cares . " " What they don ' t need is public ridicule , and I won ' t have any part of that , " Ryan added . In announcing his candidacy last month , Cosentino said motorists convicted of drunken driving should be forced to display special license plates acknowledging the offense . The father of six children and grandfather of three , Ryan also said he would continue Edgar ' s programs to combat illiteracy , suggesting that public libraries must be financed " with the same priority as the schools . " " We can and must do more to pry our kids from the front of the television set and put them behind a book , " he said . Ryan , a pharmacist in Kankakee , served five terms in the legislature , the last as House speaker . In 1982 , with Gov . James Thompson ' s support , he won a three-way contest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was elected lieutenant governor in 1982 and re-elected in 1986 . He received a clear shot at the nomination for secretary of state last week when Illinois Transportation Secretary Greg Baise said , in the interests of party unity , he would not challenge the 55-year-old Ryan . Baise ' s decision to forgo the race eliminated the only substantial primary contest foreseen on the Republican ticket . On the Democratic side , Burns said he would remain in the campaign for attorney general " all the way , " which could lead to a four-way contest with the expected entry of Chicago attorney Michael Howlett Jr. , son of a former secretary of state and Adlai Stevenson ' s running mate in the 1986 gubernatorial election . Burns , 43 , who played basketball at Northwestern University , and briefly as a professional player for the Chicago Bulls , said he has raised between $50 , 000 and $75 , 000 thus far of the $500 , 000 he expects the primary campaign to cost . Although he is a long shot in the race , Burns has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Hallock , a key fundraiser for Mayors Harold Washington and Eugene Sawyer , media consultant Thom Serafin , and the Boston-based ad firm of Ken Swope and Associates , which prepared Sawyer ' s television campaign and advised Massachusetts Gov . Michael Dukakis ' presidential campaign . The attorney general ' s office has been more closely associated with civil litigation than criminal prosecutions , but Burns said he would turn it into a weapon against drug trafficking in the state . Burns said he is pro-choice on the question of abortion and suggested that he would have declined to appeal the Ragsdale case out of Illinois to the U.S. Supreme Court if he had been attorney general . " I accept the findings of the lower court , " he said . " They have said it ' s an undue , unreasonable impingement on a woman ' s right to make a decision on the abortion question .
