Earl Shorris is- the author of SceneS from Corporate Life ( Penguin ) and Jews Without Money ( Anchor ) . not beautiful , not entirely credible , not deeply affecting . The victim is neither a hero nor an artist ; the victim is a victim . The immediate cause of Valladares 's death was an inflationary spiral of self-righteousness . He died slowly , becoming more and more abstract , until he disappeared from life . I was not alone in killing him . Here is a partial list of those who helped : Elliott Abrams , Alex- ander Cockburn , John Corry , Armando Hart Ddvalos , Warren Hinckle 3d , Reed Irvine , Hilton Kramer , Mary McGrory , Aryeh Neier , Ronald Radosh , David Reiff , R. Emmett Tyrrell . We are the ancient alliance of enemies ; we will not be satisfied until both Hector and Achilles are dead . As Homer explained : Each side has a mass of bitter words to say : no deepsea ship could take that load , even a hundredbencher . . Men have twisty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; wide is the grazing land of . words , ? both east and west . The manner of speech you use , the same you are apt to hear . By what necessity must we goad one another face to face with provocations ? like two city , women ... ruffling into the middle of a street to wrangle , bitten by rage , - with many a true word  --  and some false , for anger calls out those as well . And Helen is soon forgotten in her human life , abstracted , lost , paler than death . When Odysseus seeks to rally his men , Athena advises him to tell the men not to abandon the siege of Troy , because " The dead do not wish it . " The opportunity to watch a murder in progress was provided to the readers of the New York Times Op-Ed page recently by Elliott Abrams , Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American . , Affairs : Mr. Castro has been shaken by the international attention given to Mr. Valladares . Yet other nations ' policies , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reaction to belated disclosures of past abuses . But they 're more likely to change policy in reaction to ongoing abuses . This is what Mr. Castro fears  --  disclosures that will affect not only what people think about his tyranny but also what other governments will do to express their revulsion . The methods of the gods have not changed since the Greeks laid siege to Troy . Murder is a sin of omission . Abstract the victim , use him and move on . Abrams is fighting an old war in preparation for a new one . There is not much time . He does his work openly . He is not a philosopher , he is paid to kill ; opinion is his opening barrage , like the thunder that precedes the battle . There is also death by commission : in the course of a debate I heard a young neoconservative say , " Fascism was a brief phenomenon . " I can not help thinking , in retrospect , that it was the most vulgar sentence I had ever heard , the killing again of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as deeply , hideously anti-Semitic as Irving Kristol justifying the torture of JacObo Timerman by Jew-hating Argentine neofascists or Norman Podhoretz publishing a defense of those same Argentine torturers and murderers . Should we despair of the history of events ? Is there any history but the history of ideas ? Armando Valladares wrote the history of his years in prison , and we have no reason to doubt what he said , according to Abrams , Corry , McGrory , , Irvine , Radosh , Reiff and Tyrrell , and every reason to doubt it , according to Cockburn , Hart and Hinckle . They all speak as if to prove Marx 's view of ideology , which may be brutalized as Where you sit is where you stand . If class is the beginning of ideology , it is surely not the end . For Talcott Parsons , ideology is a sort of wishing , reality made to conform to a preferred concept . For Georges Sorel , ideologies are directed by myths . Myths need not be born of reality in Sorel 's view because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes is inspired by myth . The controversy over the Valladares memoir would seem to prove Sorel 's theory . Myths also inspire stability , as Durkheirn explained ; they are the commonly held beliefs of the members of a society . If that is the case , the battle between ideologies is the battle to make or destroy myths , which Homer knew ? Hector had his gods and Achilles his . For the left , Cuba is the stuff of which myths are made : Batista overthrown , Che 's New Man created . Cuba is the human face of successful revolution ; that is the myth that gives stability and coherence to the society of the left . For the right , Valladares is Sorel 's myth of the clean sweep  --  he provides a way of understanding Cuba as a vast prison ; he becomes an inspiration to the kind of certainty that results in action . For the right , Valladares is not a man , but a weapon to be used against the bastion or communism in the West . The left , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth as if it were the soul of social justice in our time . Both the attacking . right and the defending left have enormous problems to overcome . Cuba is not paradise . Nor is it hell . The left wishes away the terrible conditions of Cuban prisons , the great number of political prisoners . The right will not admit the rise in literacy or the decline in infant mortality or even the dancing of Alicia Alonso . Both sides must speak the heightened language of ideology to overcome the gravity of the truth . A clue , perhaps a proof , of the role of myth in the dispute over Valladares may be found in the choice of words in one of the arguments . Ronald Radosh , in The New York Times Book Review , wrote : " Until the publication of this book . . . we had not had a full picture of the brutality meted out to real and imaginary opponents by the Castro dictatorship . " And then , " they were thrown into punishment cells , including the dreaded ' drawer cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamous tiger cages seem like homey quarters . " When a writer speaks of brutality toward imaginary opponents he is speaking of imaginary brutality , of nightmare but not of reality , which is a way of making the world conform to the myths of his ideology . Similarly the writer may invent impossible conjunctions of realities to remake the world in accordance with his myth , as in the argument about " drawer cells , " " tiger cages " and " homey quarters . " There is , of course , no way that Radosh can know about drawer cells and tiger cages and compare them with homey quarters . Alexander Cockburn , who holds a very different ideology , uses the same tactic by joining Armando Valladares 's book to Ronald Radosh 's betrayal of his uncle , - in his reply to a letter from Radosh in The Nation see " Letters , " Sept. 201 : I ? think Ronald Radosh was " moved " by Armando Valladares 's book largely because it allowed him to get paid by The New York Times for dashing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tunnel vision that goes with that trade . There are plenty of accounts , far more convincing than the ill-written jumble that constitutes Valladares 's " recollections , " of Palestinians rotting and tortured in Israel 's jails ; but I have n't noticed Radosh being " moved " by their accounts , or taking the risky course of challenging the U.S. propaganda machine on Israel . Radosh 's idea of taking a courageous intellectual stance is to submit to The Washington Post an article saying his uncle wasted his life defending the Spanish Republic during the Civil War . Since myths are invented , one would expect them to be as orderly as art or arithmetic , but that has not been the . case , at least since Homer . The old gods and the young gods accuse each other of hubris and commonness even though they may be allies . And often the small wars within one camp of mythmakers are the cruelest . David Reiff , who is the son of Susan Sontag , used the Valladares memoir to attack the myth of a coherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticommunism around the sorrowful and imposing figure of his mother . Of the old gods of his camp he says ( The New Republic , July 28 ) , a " decent feeling of mourning for a great human hope is what is missing from neo-conservatism ; though its anti-communism is correct , its way with ideas is coarse and vulgar when compared with the tradition it criticizes . " Then one of the old gods , Hilton Kramer , editor of Th ? New Criterion , appears in the form of a scorpion to punish the young one for his hubris . His method is to visit the sins of the mother upon the son and then to stand back and be amused at the son 's predicament . It is a nasty business between Kramer and Sontag and son , " like , two city women ruffling into the middle of a street to Wrangle . " Kramer says in the September New Criterion , " neoconservatism ... emerged from the turmoil of the Sixties to defend American democracy against the atrocious ideas of people like Susan Sontag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticommunism ; Reiff argues that his form of anticommunism emerged from the turmoil of the 1960s to defend the human race against the atrocious ideas of people like Fidel Castro . Kramer informs his readers early on that David Reiff is merely using the Valladares memoir , but it does not occur to him to say anything about his use of the man 's life . For a man to be reduced to a means apparently carries no weight for Kramer or Reiff . Or for Cockburn or Hart . And it is merely noted here . This business of opinion was of such importance to Simone Well that she said , ? Publications destined to influence what is called opinion , that is to say , in effect , the conduct of life , constitute acts and ought to be subjected to the same restrictions as are all acts . In other . words , they should not cause unlawful harm of any kind to any human being , and above all , should never contain any denial , explicit or implicit , of the eternal obligations toward the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Weil worked in factories to learn the worker 's life and later starved herself to death because she could not bear to eat while others went hungry , but she was not a fool ; she had witnessed the rise ? of fascism , she knew the power of opinion . " The need of freedom itself , " she wrote , " so essential to the intellect , calls for a corresponding protection against suggestion , propaganda , influence by means of obsession . " Her fear was of the power of ideology . She was a romantic who loved reason . In contrast to Sorel , who ' believed in the power of the unconscious , the ? lan vital , the myth that gives life to social movements , ' Simone Weil was rooted in the reality of sweat and hunger , she began with truth ; and even if one disagrees with the meaning she found in religion , there can be no doubt about her motives . Her answer to the effect of ideology on journalism is commonplace : tell the truth . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , that every opinion is an honest opinion . What is said as fact is fact in the mind of the speaker . If Jorge Valls , author of Twenty Years &; Forty Days : Life in a Cuban Prison , in his cool , credible description of the years in which he and Armando Valladares were in the same prisons , gives an account , of the punishments and deprivations political prisoners endured , and Valladares 's version is so heightened that it must be considered a work of a different kind , there is no reason to suspect that either man is lying , despite our firm belief in a single objective reality ' . How different is the step from Valls to Valladares , from the distinction between raw truth and the imposition of editorial sensibilities required to arrive at " All the News That 's Fit to Print " ? There are two dimensions of truth , according to Roy Medvedev : necessary truth and truth that is not necessary ; the larger truth and the smaller truth ; truth of the isolated fact and truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual event and truth of the overall phenomenon ; apparent truth and real truth . This notion of two dimensions of truth , or double truth has antecedents in the thirteenth-century Roman Catholic Church , which held that an idea could be both true and false : logically or philosophically true and theologically false . On a scale at which the differences between the larger truth and the smaller truth become obvious , the outrages of Stalinism may be described as the smaller truth , while the scientific and economic progress of the Soviet Union since 1917 may be described as the larger truth ; the pleasures of democracy may be described as the larger truth of the United States , while the miseries of racism and poverty may be described as the smaller truth . In Changing the Rules of the Game , Armando Hart DAvalos , Cuban Minister of Culture , argues that Cuba 's enemies ( the information transnationals ) want to concentrate on the smaller truth . " Are issues in the arts to be judged by scandals about fabricated cases , ' or the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asks . And concludes , " Our greatest scandal ' is the Revolution itself . " One of the smaller ? truths or " cases " to which he refers is that of Armando Valladares ; Minister Hart - is the most forthcoming of those who conspired to kill him . The turn of mind of those who live by the larger or smaller truths fits the story of the hedgehog and the fox in Isaiah Berlin 's essay on Tolstoy . He quotes the Greek poet Archilochus : " The fox knows many things , but the hedgehog knows one big thing . " And he gives the reader two lists of examples . The foxes : Shakespeare , Herodotus , Aristotle , Montaigne , Erasmus , Moliere , Goethe , Pushkin , Balzac and Joyce . The hedgehogs : Dante , Plato , " Lucretius , Pascal , Hegel , Dostoyevsky , Nietzsche , - Ibsen and Proust . It is an oversimplification , as Berlin warns his readers , but it begins to explain who would murder Valladares and who would permit him to live . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , but the larval form of the essay , the difference between the larger truths of the hedgehogs and the smaller truths of the foxes is based in the order of the process : whether meaning is contingent on truth or truth is contingent on meaning . If the writer lives in a world defined by the myths of ideology , the order of thought is clear and comforting : ideol ogy is meaning , therefore truth must conform to ideology . Whatever is outside the- ideological construct is trary to reality , a lie . Armando Yana-dares was one of Batista 's monsters or Alicia Alonso does not exist . There is paradise or hell , but there is no Cuba . And the hedgehogs have killed Valladares . If the writer makes meaning contingent on truth , he must deal with the living , the creature that is as intransigent as his own navel , the one that stinks , the one that implies and is implied , the one that bumbles and bleeds as it goes along between life  --  and death , stupid and weary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for caprice . This writer lives with smaller truths , like the great fox Montaigne , enduring a life so unpredictable and yet so rich he will be reduced to stating his motto in the form of a question , a surrender to the wonder of existence , such as , " What do I know ? " The insecurity of the life of the fox is unendurable , as any good salesman knows . Read the advertisements for banks or brokerage firms ; investors prefer security to ' profit . Or listen to the Rev. Jerry Falwell , who promises his television audience the " eternal security of the believer . " The fox will suffer anxiety , but the fox will never suffer what Isaiah Berlin calls " the despotism of fanatical theorists " ; the fox will never be a slave . When the writer of opinion accepts despotic rule over the order of his reason , it results in the kind of work produced for The New York Times by John Corry in his review of Cuba : In the Shadow of Doubt , a documentary shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideologue 's ironic self-righteousness : " Let 's hear it now for the Cuban revolution , a fine adventure gone slightly astray , although not through any fault of Fidel Castro . " He goes on to say that the program is not balanced , that even though it shows " friends and foes of Mr. Castro .. . this is window dressing . The one-hour documentary sells a myth . " To argue with a current film of a women 's prison in Cuba , he cites the Valladares memoir . Then he writes , " The peek inside the women 's prison , of course , makes it harder to believe reports like that . Indeed , the documentary . . . does n't want us to think badly of Cuba at all . " To think badly is to make truth contingent on meaning , to think inside the construct of an ideology . Only then can one accept the kind of myth that Corry sees in other men 's opinions , but not in his own . Taking Corry 's conclusion that the PBS program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irvine 's " Accuracy in Media Report " stated , " The propaganda is for Fidel Castro and his revolution , which has impoverished , enslaved , and exiled millions of the once happy people of Cuba . " Of course , Irvine 's statement is foolish ; Jorge Valls declared that in 1958 he thought that Cuba under Batista was " in danger of becoming a totalitarian state , as fanatical as Hitler 's Germany . " But the Irvine statement is a good example of the larger truth . Proof of the larger truth for Accuracy in Media is the Valladares memoir : " No one with any integrity could have read Valladares and then approved airing a film containing monstrous lies about things that Valladares had exposed in his book . " The victim , who was a man , has become a myth ; he is no longer an arguable creature , as uncertain as the next moment of your life or mine ; he defines the world , his word is incontrovertible ; according to Ronald Rad osh , he brings suit against those who doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has taken the side of the old myth . He has journeyed to Cuba , where he " took the trouble to check out Valladares 's background , " and found that " Valladares was no ' poet ' but was rather a member of the hated Batista police who killed and tortured at will , and a prot  --  g ? of Armando Carratala , the most bloodthirsty of Batista 's professional torturers . " A man who had recently emigrated from Rumania told me that he preferred the Nazis to the Russians . Communism , he Said , bothered everyone all the time in little ways , while the Nazis were easy to get along with , unless you were a Jew . The happy people of Cuba under Batista , the happy gentiles of Rumania under Hitler : the political myth makes sense only to those who make truth contingent on meaning . It is not myth used to explain reality , as in literature since Aeschylus ; it is myth used in place of reality . In recent years , abuses of human rights have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights in use in the West is essentially a bourgeois notion , for it is legalistic at its core . Human rights as they are understood in the rest of the world concern more elemental conditions of existence  --  food , shelter , clothing , literacy . Thus , when an American questions a Russian about the gulag , the Russian replies with a question about the homeless . The issue is not which category of human rights is more important . We must , as Aryeh Neier of Americas Watch says , have both . The issue is why so many writers choose to place themselves inside a construct that makes them blind to one category or the other , why writers can not agree with Neier that Armando Valladares is probably not the most reliable witness of Cuba 's violations of the human rights of many of its citizens . In fact , there is no true dialectic of myth , for there can be no synthesis except in the minds of those who live outside the construct of an ideology , the lonely ones who live impossibly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any set . In their loneliness is the beginning of understanding of the allure of ideology . The ideological writers are not like the examples drawn by Czeslaw Milosz , victims of the incomprehensible duplici- , ty called ketman , sufferers like Tadeusz Borowski , the novelist who wandered from concentration camp to communism to suicide . No such monstrous experiences attend life as a newspaper columnist in San Francisco or a member of a propaganda tank in Washington ; these writers have chosen to live under " the despotism of fanatical theorists " for other reasons . The writing of ideologues is driven by sentimentality , not the mawkish insincerity that Frank Sinatra sings , but thought controlled by emotion , growing out of emotion . At first , it seems unlikely that a book review or a television . critic 's columns would proceed from emotion , but these are not reviews , they are expressions of belonging , of safety , family , home ; they are the work of the warriors of myth , who suffer terrible anxiety over the health of the myth which provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentality of the most sincere kind , heartfelt emotion ; for the ideologue , the one who can not bear the thought of the lonely and capricious life of the person who makes meaning contingent on truth , every article , every review , every sentence is an auto-da-fe . The stabilized world of ideology permits no deviation from certainty . In one of the thoughts comprising his little book On Certainty , Wittgenstein said , " Where two principles really do meet which can not be reconciled with one another , then each man declares the other a fool and a heretic . " Once a person enters the world of certainty , the task changes from thinking to action . With meaning already known , the fools and heretics gather over the corpses to engage in the conflict of myths . As Wittgenstein said , " At the end of reasons comes persuasion . " There is no work left for those writers but the work of publicists : a small controversy arises over something that was once a man , Armando Valladares , because war has begun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the role of the publicists is to infect the rest of the population with their certainty about Castro , Cuba and , by inference , Nicaragua . The strategy on the right is to take the human rights values of the Carter Administration and turn them against all leftist movements in the Americas . It is a wily strategy , and Fidel Castro 's policies on political dissent deliver exactly what it needs ; in the clash of myths , synecdoche is an ideal maneuver . Out of certainty comes self-righteousness , which makes one both vigorous and vulnerable . Any question is an attack which must be met with a more ferocious counterattack . Inflation results ; publicity accompanies its words with action . The ultimate act of the ideological publicist , the certain person 's perfect expression is the famous act of personal war  --  terrorism . Listen to Ch'en , the Chinese terrorist in Malraux 's Man 's Fate : " If it 's a question of killing Chiang Kai-shek , I know . As for this fellow Vologin , it 's all the same to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's obedience . For people who live as we do there must be a certainty . For him , carrying out orders is sure , I suppose , as killing is for me . Something must be sure . Must be . " Opinion , then , must be judged in the manner demanded by Simone Weil ; opinion is an act and is intended as an act ; as the myth of the right succeeds , the abstraction and use of Armando Valladares leads to murder by the Central Intelligence Agency in Nicaragua . Ideology is terrorism , the route is clear ; those who are certain are as dangerous as Plato wished to be . If that is so , then the moral goal of the political writer must be to cause uncertainty , to stand beside Ch'en as he raises a dagger over the body of his sleeping victim and whisper , " What do I know ? " ?
