SOMETHING CLOUDY , SOMETHING CLEAR By Tennessee Williams <P> " The most raffish and fantastic crew that I have met yet and even I-excessively broadminded as I am-feel somewhat shocked by the goings-on . " That was how Tennessee Williams described his Provincetown acquaintances in a letter to his friend , Novelist Donald Windham , in the summer of 1940 . Now the playwright has returned to that scene . But somehow that raffish and fantastic crew has fled his memory , and the characters on the stage of Manhattan 's Jean Cocteau Repertory would not shock a novitiate nun . <P> August , the Williams persona ( Craig Smith ) , lives in a shack on the dunes , writing his first major play and trying to entangle Kip , a dancer and Nijinsky look-alike ( Elton Cormier ) , in his grimy bedsheets . But both Kip and Clare ( Dominique Cieri ) , who acts as his protector , are doomed , he by a brain tumor , she by diabetes . The entire work is shadowed by death , which is approaching as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that it is even hard to imagine that the end , when it occurs , will matter much to them or anyone else . <P> There are sparks from the Williams fire here and there ; even when he is not in best form , Williams is never uninteresting . " How long are you going to go on working ? " Clare asks August-Tennessee . " Until I die of exhaustion , " he answers . Williams , 70 , may be somewhat tired , but like Sophocles , who wrote his last play when he was nearly 90 , he continues , on and on. - By Gerald Clarke
