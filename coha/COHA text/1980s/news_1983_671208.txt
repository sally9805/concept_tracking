Beginning with freshmen entering in the fall of 1984 , students at Barnard , for the first time , will be required to take at least one course in which they use mathematics , statistics or other forms of quantitative reasoning to solve problems . The school is developing a new course for students who are not learning quantitative reasoning elsewhere. // Requirements that students sample the full range of the curriculum will also be strengthened . And freshmen will take part in an interdisciplinary seminar taught by senior faculty members and designed to introduce students to high-level academic discourse. // // Many Schools Making Move // Barnard , in Manhattan , is one of a growing number of leading liberal arts colleges changing their curriculum requirements . Harvard College , in Cambridge , Mass. , recently completed the introduction of its new core curriculum , and the faculty of Smith College , in Northampton , Mass. , is considering new requirements that will include a course in formal and quantitative reasoning . Bryn Mawr College , in Bryn Mawr , Pa. , is also debating new requirements. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new curriculum is a response to the growing importance of mathematics and science and the greater need for intellectual breadth among students headed more and more for professional rather than academic careers. // " Quantitative skills are increasingly necessary to be a successful student in the liberal arts , to be successful in one ' s professional life and to be a successful participant in a democratic society , " Miss Futter said . " Moreover , we live in an era in which the lines between academic disciplines are becoming more blurred . There is a need for a balance between specialized knowledge and broader skills. " // Miss Futter also said the new curriculum was inspired in part by the decision of Columbia College , which is now all-male , to begin accepting women as undergraduates for the first time this fall . That move followed the breakdown of negotiations aimed at closer academic and social relationships between the two colleges. // The new curriculum will put Barnard in a stronger position to compete with Columbia for able women students , she said . " It gives us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it makes a strong statement about our commitment to teaching undergraduates. " // The present Barnard curriculum , which dates from the 1960 ' s , is a variation on the " distribution requirements " traditionally used by liberal arts colleges to assure breadth in education. // Barnard students now must take at least two one-semester courses in four out of six broad areas : fine arts , literature , other humanities , history , social sciences and mathematics . In addition , they must complete a freshman English course with intensive writing , and two semesters of a laboratory science. // During the student unrest of the 1960 ' s and 1970 ' s , many colleges relaxed or abandoned such requirements , but the trend in recent years has been to restore them. // Like Columbia College , Barnard held fast to its curriculum standards during the years of student unrest . But last year , faculty leaders decided the time was ripe to take a new look at what they were doing . " The curriculum hadn ' t been changed for 15 years , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it were a little ragged . " <> <> Old Guidelines Streamlined // Under the new curriculum , drawn up by a faculty committee and approved by the faculty as a whole earlier this month , the freshman English and laboratory science requirements will be retained , and the distribution guidelines will be streamlined to require two onesemester courses each in the humanities and the social sciences. // In addition , two new requirements will be added . First , students will have to take at least one course that requires quantitative reasoning. // That could be a mathematics , physics or computer science course that routinely requires the use of mathematics , or it could be a social science course such as political-science statistics. // For the estimated 25 percent of students whose interests and majors are such that they are not likely to encounter such offerings , the faculty will develop a new quantitative reasoning course . <> <> Problems With Math Cited // Charles S. Olton , vice president for academic affairs and dean of the faculty , said the new requirement reflects not only the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on quantification across the academic spectrum. " // " I went through the curriculum and found that exactly one-third of our courses are unavailable to the student who is innocent of numerical abilities , " he said . " You have situations where students set out on some major and then find that they can ' t draw charts or graphs or use the computer , so they drop out and major in English. " // The second new requirement is a freshman seminar taught by senior faculty members to small groups of students , normally after they have completed the English writing requirement. // The seminars will be organized around broad topics such as freedom and authority and the individual , and they will rely heavily on great books . <> <> The Bible and Karl Marx // As an example , Mr. Olton said , a hypothetical course on concepts of order might include readings from the Bible , Plato , St. Augustine , Donne , Pascal , Marx and J.S. Mill. // Mr. Olton said the seminars are designed to provide a bridge from high school to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual dialogue takes place and teach them to think about big ideas at a fairly high level of abstraction , " he said. // Faculty members predicted that the new curriculum would broaden the range of issues studied by some students . " Under the old curriculum , a student could completely avoid taking a course in , say , the social sciences , " said Professor Chapman , who was a member of the curriculum committee. // Professors , administrators and students involved in developing the new curriculum said it reflected several assumptions about current trends in higher education . <> <> Students Favor Requirements // One is that students today are more willing than those of a decade ago to accept faculty authority in curriculum matters . " Students recognize that requirements are good , " said Lisa Deitsch , a senior anthropology major from Livingston , N.J. , who was a member of the committee . " I ' m a mathophobe . If I had been required to take some math , I would probably feel more comfortable. " // Another assumption is that , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic careers and more into business , law and other professions. // " Faculty members are less involved in replicating themselves , " said Mr. Olton . " For the students , this means less specializing and more broadening out . It means that we are trying to educate the man for all seasons who will change careers 18 times. " // The new curriculum was developed and adopted in a single year . At other schools , such as Vassar College in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , proposed new curriculums have been rejected because of faculty opposition . <> <> Plan Developed With Faculty // Mr. Olton said one reason for the relatively smooth sailing at Barnard was that instead of proposing a finished product for faculty members to criticize , the committee began by offering only the sketchiest of outlines and developed the full plan in response to faculty debates. // Robert McCaughey , a historian who was a member of the committee , suggested that the changing situation of faculty members also contributed to the approval of the curriculum. // " Faculty members are less mobile today than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t expect to move from university to university . As a result , their loyalties are increasingly oriented around the welfare of their local institutions as well as their field. " // Faculty criticism of the new curriculum has centered on the practicality of requiring senior faculty members to invest the time in developing and teaching the freshman seminars . Mr. Olton said that in order to minimize this problem , the college will seek outside foundation support to allow faculty members to develop the new courses , perhaps during summers. // But some people have criticized the movement away from strict reliance on traditional academic disciplines . " Barnard is a liberal arts college , and they shouldn ' t change their requirements as if everyone is going to business school , " said Mindy Siegel , an 18-year-old junior from the Jamaica Estates section of Queens. // But Viviana Zelizer , a professor of sociology and member of the committee , said the new curriculum would be in keeping both with Barnard ' s traditional emphasis on the liberal arts and with the importance of majors in students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " it never would have gotten by the faculty.
