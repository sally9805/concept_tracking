NEW YORK  --  Interest rates soared yesterday as the dollar ' s continued plunge intensified speculation that the Federal Reserve System will tighten credit conditions soon . Some short-term rates , such as those on Treasury bills , jumped more than a quarter of a percentage point . In the bond market , prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds plunged about two points , or $20 for each $1 , 000 face amount . Corporate and municipal bonds also fell sharply . For the first time in more than a year , the yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bond has risen above 8% . " The bond market really is in the tank . It ' s a disaster , " said George J. Collins , president and chief executive officer of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore . Added Irwin L. Kellner , chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co . , " It ' s craziness in the markets . " Bond prices began their sharp descent in the Tokyo and London markets after the U.S. and its major trading partners issued what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the currency-stabilization accord of Feb. 22 . The dollar ' s precipitous drop also jolted the commodity markets . The surge in precious metals prices heightened fear about inflation , exacerbating the bond market ' s woes . Earlier this year , many analysts were predicting lower interest rates on the theory that the Federal Reserve would have to ease credit conditions to help rejuvenate the economy . Some analysts still insist that the economy needs further stimulus . But the dollar ' s difficulties and growing pessimism about inflation have radically changed perceptions about what the Fed is likely to do . Paul Volcker , chairman of the Reserve Board , repeatedly has warned that a falling dollar will increase inflation as prices of imported goods rise . He also has emphasized his concern that a sharp drop in the dollar could discourage foreign investors from buying U.S. bonds . Foreign investors have acquired huge amounts of U.S. government bonds in the past few years , helping to meet the federal government ' s borrowing needs . Skepticism about the effectiveness of central bank intervention in the currency markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was designed to restore stability to the foreign-exchange markets , the dollar has dropped about 6% against the Japanese yen . " The weakness of the dollar is going to affect Fed policy sooner or later , if it hasn ' t already done so , " said Ryland E.D. Chase , chairman of Vigilant Advisors Inc. , a mutual fund manager and investment counselor . Mr. Volcker " has made it very clear that he is not going to tolerate a much lower dollar on his watch , " he said . Therefore , he concluded , the Fed ' s only choice now is to raise interest rates . Rising interest rates already have begun to affect many types of loans . Just last week , major banks raised their prime lending rate to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2% , the first increase in nearly three years . The prime rate is used by banks as a base to calculate rates on loans to many small and medium-sized companies as well as on numerous types of consumer loans . Home mortgage rates also have jumped . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage point to 9. 3% , according to a survey by HSH Associates , a Riverdale , N.J. , publisher of mortgage market information . HSH Associates said mortgage rates have responded with " uncharacteristic speed " to the recent increases in other rates . An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. plunged 21. 01 points yesterday to 1355. 99 , the lowest level since Oct. 20 . It was the second largest drop this year . The index ranged between 1349. 61 and 1379. 67 . The Treasury ' s 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell to 93 18/32 from 95 19/32 Wednesday , as the yield jumped to 8. 07% from 7. 89% . As recently as March 26 , this issue was quoted at a price of 99 3/8 to yield 7. 55% . The government ' s 7 1/4% notes due 1996 dropped to 96 11/32 from 97 26/32 Wednesday , while the yield advanced to 7. 8% from 7. 57% . Among short-term rates , the rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills rose to 5. 76% bid from 5. 49% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5. 83% bid from 5. 68% . One exception to the surge in rates was the federal funds rate . The funds rate averaged 6. 28% yesterday , according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon ( U.S.A. ) Inc . On Wednesday , it averaged 6. 45% . Some analysts raised the possibility that the Fed might try to bolster the dollar by raising its discount rate , which now is 5 1/2% . The Fed hasn ' t increased the discount rate , the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions , in more than three years . " That would be positive for the dollar but negative for the economy , " said Edward F. Sporl , senior vice president and chief economist for Siebel Capital Management in San Francisco . Federal Reserve officials , as usual , wouldn ' t divulge their credit policy strategy . The Fed ' s policy-making arm , known as the Federal Open Market Committee , met early last week to review its plans . Although the dollar ' s slump has sent shock waves through the credit markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t unhappy about the lower dollar . These analysts argue that some Reagan administration officials would welcome a further drop in the dollar in the hope that it would help U.S. exports and also defuse protectionist pressure in Congress . Elsewhere in the credit markets , the Federal Reserve yesterday afternoon reported that the nation ' s basic money supply , known as M1 , fell $2 billion to $738. 9 billion in the week ended March 30 . The news had little effect on the credit markets because the Fed already has made it clear that it isn ' t focusing on M1 in setting credit policy . The M1 measure , which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public , has averaged $737. 6 billion in the latest 13 weeks . That represents a 13% annual rate of increase from the like period 13 weeks earlier .
