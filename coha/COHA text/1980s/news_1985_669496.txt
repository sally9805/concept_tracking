But Mr. Lionni , an internationally renowned graphic designer who earlier this year was given one of that field ' s most prestigious awards - the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Graphic Arts - is as famous for his advertising and design work as for his books for children. // He finds , in fact , that the two careers overlap . He considers himself a designer rather than an illustrator and conceives of his books as a unit . He has made it a point never to illustrate another author ' s story , because he likes to deal with ' ' the whole object . If I started doing that , ' ' he explains , ' ' my whole work would change , because I would have to invent styles for stories which were not my style. ' ' // // The pairing of writing with illustration gives him control over the flow of text and picture . ' ' I hope to achieve a coherence between the visual style and the verbal style , ' ' he says in a quiet but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my great ambitions. ' ' // Of all the book illustrations Lionni has published , he is proudest of the first page in ' ' Little Blue and Little Yellow . ' ' The ' ' characters ' ' in this book are blue and yellow pieces of paper , and by positioning his scraps in particular ways , he managed to create a vital book out of them. // His placement of ' ' Little Blue , ' ' for example , illustrates what Lionni feels is a strong coherence between the visual and the verbal . ' ' There are thousands of places you can position that daub , and there are a thousand ways to begin the story , ' ' he explains , smiling slightly . ' ' But I think the positioning of the daub in the middle , and saying very plainly and bluntly , ' This is Little Blue ' , ' ' achieves the best balance between what the reader sees and hears. // Picture books and the relations between their visual and verbal components are important for young children , educators have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before a child reads , ' ' he explains in a lightly accented voice , a picture book gives a child ' ' a sense of structure of information , ' ' and it does so ' ' without him knowing it , in a very original way . ' ' The structure shows a child that there ' s a beginning and an end , that actions follow in sequences , and that there is a connection between imagery and words. // He points out that a child also learns how to fill in the ' ' fictional gap ' ' - in other words , what happens between the time a character is shown getting out of a car , say , and then sitting on the front porch . ' ' In an illustrated book , this happens between the spreads from page to page , ' ' he says , ' ' and you get the child in the habit of filling in - of completing - the story between the elements that are not said or shown. ' ' // Parents play an important role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They ' re the ones who are the intermediaries . . . - they read the stories , and they have to act it out . If they read a book they like , it comes across ( to ) the child . If they don ' t like the book , they ' re not going to do a good acting job. ' ' // Although many children ' s writers try to keep in close touch with today ' s youngsters so as to reach them at their own level , Lionni ' s approach is different . He believes that the feelings and motivations of children have changed considerably since he was a child growing up in the Netherlands , Belgium , and Italy some 65 years ago . ' ' One of the reasons I do animal fables , ' ' he explains , ' ' is that that doesn ' t tie me to any specific kind of children - a blond or black or brown or red or yellow child . It doesn ' t tie me to any specific surroundings , like skyscrapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom to tackle can-do books about problems , feelings , and concerns that are universal , he says. // The animals in Lionni ' s books are not elaborately drawn . His aim is to reduce each one to a concise symbol . Mice are some of his favorite characters . ' ' All the bodies are the same , all the ears are the same , the legs . When I work , I have little dishes before me . . . . ( with ) different kinds of paper : I have ear paper and film paper and what I call mouse paper , which is the gray paper to make the mice with , ' ' he says . It is the positioning of the eyes that gives the mice their individuality , according to Lionni , and the arrangement of the mice on the page that conveys the relationships and moods of the story. // Several of his books have been made into animated films . At the moment , he is working on three new ones for Swiss television . He thinks that the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he believes that television can not teach children to take an active part in what they are doing - and that books can. // Children , he says , ' ' participate very little ' ' while watching television . With a book , a child ' s imagination is stimulated and he or she can create a fantasy world , he explains . The child can also carry the book around - in the car , to school , or out shopping . With a television show , once it ' s over , there ' s nothing left. // When Lionni was growing up , of course , there was no television . The school he attended emphasized nature studies , and these helped foster what became a lifelong interest . As a child , he furthered this interest with a collection of small animals , mostly reptiles , which he kept in terrariums. // Today Lionni doesn ' t have time to keep a terrarium , though he wishes he could . Instead , he and his wife have a home in the countryside near Siena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lionnis divide their time between // Siena and New York City . And although their New York apartment lacks the natural charms of the Siena home , Lionni likes the urban side of his life too. // ' ' You always think of a city as this big thing that you live in , ' ' he notes . ' ' Well , it isn ' t actually true , because you live in a small part of the city . If you like that part of the city and feel comfortable , you ' re very fortunate . ' ' New York ' ' is there to remind me of the cultural ' ' side of life. // // // //
