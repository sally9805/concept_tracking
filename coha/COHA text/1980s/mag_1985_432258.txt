 | Always a power behind her man , Nancy Reagan now is stepping forth into a more public role ? Mrs. President . Today , with the nation 's Chief Executive recuperating from cancer surgery , his wife is becoming an even more visible caretaker of the President and , in her own way , the Presidency . She is performing no official duties , making no decisions on policy , assuming no leadership on issues . Yet while Chief of Staff Donald Regan manages Oval Office business and Vice President Bush handles many of the rituals of office , the First Lady has the last word on use of the White House 's key resources ? Ronald Reagan 's time , his energy and his image . She quickly made it clear that aides should not expect the President to come to the Oval Office during his first week out of the hospital . James Rosebush , the First Lady 's chief aide , quotes her as saying : " Let 's make sure he is comfortable . Let 's not let him overdo . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want him to show , as quickly as feasible , that he is still a vital , vigorous leader . It 's just as certain that Mrs. Reagan will husband her husband 's strength . It was she who controlled visits to the President in the hospital . Long a presence among the high counselors , with a keen interest in the President 's schedule , her influence was carefully veiled during his first term . Now , however , some of the President 's men more readily acknowledge that she is determined to safeguard Reagan 's place in history as well as his health . Even before his surgery , she was assertive in protecting the President . She put her foot down this spring when aides planned a trip for Reagan to California with a return to Washington the same day . Spotting that on the schedule , she made a quick call to Chief of Staff Regan . As a result , other appearances were added that allowed an overnight rest on the West Coast . Off limits . She can be just as adamant as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because of her concern that her husband was being perceived as " trigger happy , " she urged that he avoid appearances at militaryrelated events such as ship dedications and visits to air bases . This advice was followed until his commencement speech at the Naval Academy in May . As Mrs. Reagan described her feelings about the President 's image to US . News &; World Report : " I would read reports that he was a man who was going to start World War III at the drop of a hat . I know he is not that kind of man and that 's not what he wants . It bothered me . You just do n't like that said about somebody you love , knowing that it 's not true . I may have said in conversation to aides that perception in the press is  | portraying him in an unfair , harsh light that I do n't think he deserves . " Insiders report she is a woman of strong opinions that she transmits in phone calls to the chief of staff that begin promptly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included the divorce and remarriage of Helene von Damm while ambassador to Austria , which Mrs. Reagan saw as a possible embarrassment to the administration . Von Damm has since resigned . After she said she felt that an appearance of lightly clad Japanese sumo wrestlers in the Rose Garden would be undignified , the visit was scrubbed . But aides insist she does not give orders or make decisions for the President on substantive matters . Rather , they say they try to enlist her support because they recognize she is an important part of the process of persuasion . " If this is a city of power and access , " says one staff member , " Nancy Reagan has the ultimate access . " Special concerns . Sheila Tate , the First Lady 's press secretary before joining the Burson-Marsteller public-relations firm in February , says : " She would n't weigh in on sending troops to Lebanon , but she would comment on individuals , issues and how people react to political implications . " Former aide and longtime friend Michael Deaver observes , " Nancy Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most important , she knows her man . If he 's under fire , she gives her opinion to the person who can make a difference . Right now , that person is Don Regan . " Friends say a high priority for Mrs. Reagan is public perception of the President . Since the operation , she has approved every photo of Reagan released by the White House . Typical of her sense of public relations was the decision to cancel their July vacation at the California ranch . Aides say she advised against the trip while Shiite terrorists held a planeload of Americans in Beirut . Foreseeing possible unmet expectations that could follow next November 's meeting between the President and Soiet leader Gorbachev , Mrs. Reagan favored not labeling the session a " summit . " The White House is billing the talks as " a get-acquainted meeting . " Reagan lieutenants say the First Lady favors easing tensions with the Kremlin and has scored diplomatic points herself . They cite an encounter in the Red Room last fall with Andrei Gromyko , then the Soviet Foreign Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . She quickly replied : " Peace . " It was only one word , but as Deaver notes , " Gromyko was smart enough to know Nancy Reagan was a very important part of whatever relationship there was going to be . He asked the question , and she came back with a good answer . " Although her influence on shaping of the President 's image is strong , aides say she does not prevail on every issue , especially when her views conflict with Reagan 's own . For example , she favored canceling his visit to the Bitburg cemetery in West Germany after controversy arose over the Nazi graves there . " She was very distressed that the trip was harmful to the President , but he was equally firm about not changing his schedule since he had made the commitment , " reports a friend . " She worried about it for weeks . " Some presidential aides say privately that the First Lady sulks when displeased . But she explains : " My nature is to get quiet and pull back if something hurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pulled back from the press , for example , because I felt hurt and did n't give them a chance to know me . They , on the other hand , maybe jumped the gun a little bit . " Her own image has brightened with time . When she came to the White House , she was often depicted in the press as a luxury-loving elitist , as Queen Nancy , the Belle of Rodeo Drive . If , as she believes , reporters were hasty in judging her , she seemed to make some of her own problems . In 1981 , with the nation slipping into recession , she let rich friends raise some $800,000 to redecorate the White House family quarters and permitted one wealthy donor to buy new presidential china for $209,000 . The picture of an extravagant , porcelain-doll-like wife faded because of careful moves and her own mettle . She got attention for her interest in drug abuse and rehabilitation . And , she got tougher . In 1981 , after surgeons removed the bullet fired into the President 's chest in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping . Afterward , she lost weight and seemed depressed . On July 15 , when she learned of Reagan 's cancer , she was a figure of composure and resolve . After a few minutes alone with her husband , she returned to the White House and greeted 308 guests that night at a diplomatic reception , calling herself " sort of a standin " for the President . Two days later , she visited the aircraft carrier U.S.S. America to spotlight the Navy 's drug-and-alcohol-abuse efforts . " More attuned . " As she told U S.News &; World Report before the President 's operation , " If there is any contribution I make , it 's that I 'm more attuned than my husband to people who try to take advantage or end-run him . He 's busy and his mind does n't work that way . Maybe it 's my female intuition . I 'm a people person . In other words , if people use my husband for their own agenda , I can see it from a distance . . . . You try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
