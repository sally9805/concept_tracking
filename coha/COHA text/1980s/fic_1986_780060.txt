 | Reginri frowned at the water where the fluke had emerged . Deep currents welled up and rippled the surface . " Let 's have your cable , " Sasuke said . " Reel it over here . I 've got the mooring shaft sunk in . " Reginri spun out the rest of his spool and had some left when he reached Sasuke . Vanleo was holding a long tube pointed straight down into the water . He pulled a trigger and there was a muffled clap Reginri could hear over suit radio . He realized Vanleo was firing bolts into the ocean rock to secure their cable and connectors . Sasuke held out his hands and Reginri gave him the cable spool . It was easier to stand here ; the Drongheda screened them from most of the waves , and the undercurrents had ebbed . For a while Reginri stood uselessly by , watching the two men secure connections and mount the tappef lines . Sasuke at last waved him over , and as Reginri turned his back , they fitted the lines into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motion , but there were none . The ventral grooves formed an intricate ribbed pattern along the creature 's side , and it was some moments before he thought to look upward and find the pithole . It was a red-rimmed socket , darker than the dappled brown around it . The ventral grooves formed an elaborate helix around the pithole , then arced away and down the body toward a curious mottled patch , about the same size as the pithole . " What 's that ? " Reginri said , pointing at the patch . " Do n't know , " Vanleo said . " Seems softer than the rest of the hide , but it 's not a hole . All the Drongheda have em . " Looks like a welt or something . " " Ummm , " Vanleo murmured , distracted . " We 'd better boost you up in a minute . I 'm going to go around to the other side . There 's another pithole exposed there , a little farther up from the water line . I 'll go in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Spikes , " Sasuke murmured . " It 's shallow enough here . " It took several minutes to attach the climbing spikes to Reginri 's boots . He leaned against the Drongheda for support and tried to mentally compose himself for what was to  | come . The sea welled around him , lapping warmly against his skinsuit . He felt a jittery sense of anticipation . " Up you go , " Sasuke said . " Kneel on my shoulders and get the spikes in solid before you put any weight on them . Do what we said , once you 're inside , and you 'll be all right . " V. Vanleo steadied him as he climbed onto Sasuke 's back . It took some moments before Reginri could punch the climbing spikes into the thick , crinkled hide . He was thankful for the low gravity . He pulled himself up easily , once he got the knack of it , and it took only a few moments to climb the ten meters to the edge of the pithole . Once there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , " he said lightly . " Good boy . " Vanleo waved up at him . " Just keep steady and you 'll be perfectly all right . We 'll give you a signal on the com-line when you 're to come out . This one wo n't be more than an hour , probably . " Reginri balanced himself on the lip of the pithole and took several deep breaths , tasting the oily air . In the distance gray waves broke into surf . The Drongheda rose like a bubble from the wrinkled sea . A bank of fog was rolling down the coastline . In it a shadowy shape floated . Reginri slitted his eyes to see better , but the fog wreathed the object and blurred its outline . Another Drongheda ? He looked again but the form melted away in the white mist . " Hurry it up , " Sasuke called from below . " We wo n't move until you 're in . " Reginri turned on the fleshy ledge beneath him and pulled at the dark blubbery folds that rimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming threads all round the entrance . A mouth ? An anus ? Vanleo said not ; the scientists who came to study the Drongheda had traced its digestive tract in crude fashion . But they had no idea what the pithole was for . It was precisely to find that out that Vanleo first went into one . Now it was Vanleo 's theory that the pithole was the Drongheda 's method of communication , since why  | else would the neural connections be so close to the surface inside ? Perhaps , deep in the murky ocean , the Drongheda spoke to each other through these pitholes , rather than singing , like whales . Men had found no bioacoustic signature in the schools of Drongheda they had observed , but that meant very little . Reginri pushed inward , through the iris of spongy flesh , and was at once immersed in darkness . His suit light clicked on . He lay in a sheath of meat with perhaps two hand spans of clearance on each side . The tunnel yawned ahead , absorbing the weak light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade . " Electronics crew reports good contact with your tapper lines . This com okay ? " Sasuke 's voice came thin and high in Reginri 's ear . " Seems to be . Goddamned close in here . " " Sometimes it 's smaller near the opening , " Vanleo put in . " You should n't have too much climbing to do  --  most pitholes run pretty horizontal , when the Drongheda is holding steady like this . " " It 's so tight . Going to be tough , crawling uphill , " Reginri said , an uncertain waver in his voice . " Do n't worry about that . Just keep moving and look for the neural points . " Vanleo paused . " Fish out the contacts for your tappers , will you ? I just got a call from the technicians , they want to check the connection . " " Sure . " Reginri felt at his belly . " I do n't seem to find ... " " They 're right there , just like in training , " Sasuke said sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , yeah . " Reginri fumbled for a moment and found the two metallic cylinders . They popped free of the suit and he nosed them together . " There . " " All right , all right , they 're getting the trace , " Vanleo said . " Looks like you 're all set . " " Right , about time , " Sasuke said . " Let 's get moving . " " We 're going around to the other side . So let us know if you see anything . " Reginri could hear Vanleo 's breath coming faster . " Quite a pull in this tide . Ah , there 's the other pithole . " The two men continued to talk , getting Vanleo 's equip- ment ready . Reginri turned his attention to his surroundings and wriggled upward , grunting . He worked steadily , pulling against the pulpy stuff . Here and there scaly folds wrinkled the walls , overlapping and making handholds . The waxen membranes reflected back none of his suit light . He dug in his heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that collected in the trough of the tunnel . At first the passageway flared out slightly , giving him better purchase . He made good progress and settled down into a rhythm of pushing and turning . He worked his way around a vast bluish muscle that was laced by orange lines . Even through his skinsuit he could feel a pulsing warmth come from it . The Drongheda had an internal temperature fifteen degrees Centigrade below the human 's , but still an oppressive dull heat seeped through to him . Something black lay ahead . He reached out and touched VI . " Everything going well ? " Vanleo 's voice came distantly . " Think so , " Reginri wheezed . " I 'm at the lip . Going inside now . " There came the muffled sounds of a man working , and Reginri mentally blocked them out , concentrating on where he was . The walls here gleamed like glazed , aging meat . His fingers could not dig into it . He wriggled with his hips and worked forward a few centimeters . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set up the rhythm and relaxed into it , moving forward slightly . The texture of the walls coarsened and he made better progress . Every few moments he stopped and checked the threads for the corn-line and the tappers that trailed behind him , reeling out on spools at his side . something rubbery that seemed to block the pithole . His suit light showed a milky pink barrier . He wormed around and felt at the edges of the stuff . Off to the left there was a smaller opening . He turned , flexed his legs and twisted his way into the new passage . Vanleo had told him the pithole might change direction and that when it did he was probably getting close to a nexus . Reginri hoped so .  | He could hear Sasuke muttering to himself , but he was unable to concentrate on anything but the waxen walls around him . The passage narrowed again , and ahead he could see more scaly folds . But these were different , dusted with a shimmering pale powder . Reginri felt his heart beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the encrusted folds . The delicate frosting glistened in his suit lamp . Here the meat was glassy , and deep within it he could see a complex interweaving network of veins and arteries , shot through with silvery threads . It had to be a nexus ; the pictures they had shown him were very much like this . It was not in a small pocket the way Vanleo said it would be , but that did n't matter . Vanleo himself had remarked that there seemed no systematic way the nodes were distributed . Indeed , they appeared to migrate to different positions inside the pithole , so that a team returning a few days later could not find the nodules they had tapped before . Reginri felt a swelling excitement . He carefully thumbed on the electronic components set into his waist . Their low hum reassured him that everything was in order . He barked a short description of his find into his suit mike , and Vanleo responded in monosyllables . The other man seemed to be busy with something else , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He unplugged his tapper cylinders and worked them upward from his waist , his elbows poking into the pulpy membranes around him . Their needle points gleamed softly in the light as he turned them over , inspecting . Everything seemed all right . He inched along and found the spot where the frosting seemed most dense . Carefully , bracing his hands against each other , he jabbed first one and then the other needle into the waxen flesh . It puckered around the needles . He spoke quickly into his suit mike asking if the signals were coming through . There came an answering yes , some chatter from the technician back in the sand dunes , and then the line fell silent again . Along the tapper lines were flowing the signals they had come to get . Long years of experiment had  --  as far as men  | could tell  --  established the recognition codes the technicians used to tell the Drongheda they had returned . Now , if the Drongheda responded , some convoluted electrical pulses would course through the lines and into the recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as he could . The rest depended on the technicians , the electronics , the lightning microsecond blur of information transfer between the machines and the Drongheda . Somewhere above or below him were flukes , ventral fins , slitted recesses , a baleen filter mouth through which a billion small fish lives had passed , all a part of this vast thing . Somewhere , layered in fat and wedged amid huge organs , there was a mind . Reginri wondered how this had come about . Swimming through deep murky currents , somehow nature had evolved this thing that knew algebra , calculus , Reimannian metrics , Tchevychef subtleties  --  all as part of itself , as a fine-grained piece of the same language it shared with men . Reginri felt a sudden impulse . There was an emergency piece clipped near his waist , for use when the tapper lines snarled or developed intermittent shorts . He wriggled around until his back was flush with the floor of the pithole and then reached down for it . With one hand he kept the needles impacted into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thin , flat wedge of plastic and metal that he needed . From it sprouted tiny wires . He braced himself against the tunnel walls and flipped the wires into the emergency recesses in the tapper cylinders . Everything seemed secure ; he rolled onto his back and fumbled at the rear of his helmet for the emergency wiring . By attaching the cabling , he could hook directly into a small fraction of the Drongheda 's output . It would n't interfere with the direct tapping process . Maybe the men back in the sand dunes would n't even know he had done it . He made the connection . Just before he flipped his suit corn-line over to the emergency cable , he thought he felt a slight sway beneath him . The movement passed . He flipped the switch . And felt-Bursting light that lanced through him , drummed a staccato rhythm of speckled green ?  | ? Twisting lines that meshed and wove into perspectives , triangles warped into strange saddle-pointed envelopes , coiling into new soundless shapes-A latticework of shrill sound , ringing at edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone towers , precisely turning under an ellipsoid orange sun- Miniatured light that groaned and spun softly , curving into moisture that beaded on a coppery matrix of wire-A webbing of sticky strands , lifting him- A welling current- Upward , toward the watery light Reginri snatched at the cable , yanking it out of the socket . His hand jerked up to cover his face and struck his helmet . He panted , gasping . He closed his eyes and for a long moment thought of nothing , let his mind drift , let himself recoil from the experience . There had been mathematics there , and much else . Rhomboids , acute intersections in veiled dimensions , many-sided twisted sculptures , warped perspectives , poly-hedrons of glowing fire . But so much more  --  he would have drowned in it . There was no interruption of chatter through his earphone . Apparently the electronics men had never noticed the interception . He breathed deeply and renewed his grip on the tapper needles . He closed his eyes and rested for long moments . The experience had turned him inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could breathe easily again . His heart had stopped thumping wildly in his chest . The torrent of images began to recede . His mind had been filled , overloaded with more than he could fathom . He wondered how much the electronics really caught . Perhaps , transferring all this to cold ferrite memory , the emotional thrust was lost . It was not surprising that the only element men could decipher was the mathematics . Counting , lines and curves , the smooth sheen of geometry  --  they were abstractions , things that could be common to any reasoning mind . No wonder the Drongheda sent mostly mathematics through this neural passage ; it was all that men could follow .  | After a time it occurred to Reginri that perhaps Vanleo wanted it this way . Maybe he eavesdropped on the lines . The other man might seek this experience ; it certainly had an intensity unmatched by drugs or the pallid electronic coretapping in the sensoriums . Was Vanleo addicted ? Why else risk failure ? Why reject automated tapping and crawl in here  --  particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sense . If Vanleo had Drongheda tapes , he could play them back at leisure . So . . . maybe the man was fascinated by the creatures themselves , not only the mathematics . Perhaps the challenge of going inside , the feel of it , was what Vanleo liked . Grotesque , yes . . . but maybe that was it . VII . He felt a tremor . The needles wobbled in his hand . " Hey ! " he shouted . The tube flexed under him . " Something 's happening in here . You guys ? " In midsentence the corn-line went dead . Reginri automatically switched over to emergency , but there was no signal there either . He glanced at the tapper lines . The red phosphor glow at their ends had gone dead ; they were not receiving power . He wriggled around and looked down toward his feet . The tapper lines and the corn cable snaked away into darkness with no breaks visible . If there was a flaw in the line , it was farther away . Reginri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he did so , the flesh around him oozed languidly , compressing . There was a tilting sense of motion , a turning " Frange it ! Get me ? " then he remembered the line was dead . His lips pressed together . He would have to get out on his own . He dug in with his heels and tried to pull himself backward . A scaly bump scraped against his side . He pulled harder and came free , sliding a few centimeters back . The passage seemed tilted slightly downward . He put his hands out to push and saw something wet run over his fingers . The  | slimy fluid that filled the trough of the pithole was trickling toward him . Reginri pushed back energetically , getting a better purchase in the pulpy floor . He worked steadily and made some progress . A long , slow undulation began and the walls clenched about him . He felt something squeeze at his legs , then his waist , then his chest and head . The tightening had a slow , certain rhythm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his own breath , amplified in the helmet . He wriggled backward . His boot struck something and he felt the smooth lip of a turning in the passage . He remembered this , but the angle seemed wrong . The Drongheda must be shifting and moving , turning the pithole . He forked his feet into the new passageway and quickly slipped through it . This way was easier ; he slid down the slick sides and felt a wave of relief . Farther along , if the tunnel widened , he might even be able to turn around and go headfirst . His foot touched something that resisted softly . He felt around with both boots , gradually letting his weight settle on the thing . It seemed to have a brittle surface , pebbled . He carefully followed the outline of it around the walls of the hole until he had satisfied himself that there was no opening . The passage was blocked . His mind raced . The air seemed to gain a weight of its own , thick and sour in his helmet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . The surface stayed firm . Reginri felt his mind go numb . He was trapped . The corn-line was dead , probably snipped off by this thing at his feet . He felt the walls around him clench and stretch again , a massive hand squeezing the life from him . The pithole sides were only centimeters from his helmet . As he watched , a slow ripple passed through the membrane , ropes of yellow fat visible beneath the surface . " Get me out ! " Reginri kicked wildly . He thrashed against the slimy walls , using elbows and knees to gouge . The yielding pressure remained , cloaking him . " Out ! Out ! " Reginri viciously slammed his fists into the  | flesh . His vision blurred . Small dark points floated before him . He pounded mechanically , his breath coming in short gasps . He cried for help . And he knew he was going to die . Rage burst out of him . He beat at the enveloping smoothness . The gathering tightness in him boiled up , curling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter taste . He shouted again and again , battering at the Drongheda , cursing it . His muscles began to ache . And slowly , slowly the burning anger melted . He blinked away the sweat in his eyes . His vision cleared . The blind , pointless energy drained away . He began to think again . Sasuke . Vanleo . Two-faced bastards . They 'd known this job was dangerous . The incident on the beach was a charade . When he showed doubts they 'd bullied and threatened him immediately . They 'd probably had to do it before , to other men . It was all planned . He took a long , slow breath and looked up . Above him in the tunnel of darkness , the strands of the tapping lines and the corn cable dangled . One set of lines . They led upward , on a slant , the way he had come . It took a moment for the fact to strike him . If he had been backing down the way he came , the lines should be snarled behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his chest . There were no tapper lines near his legs . That meant the lines did not come up through whatever was blocking his way . No , they came only from above . Which meant that he had taken some wrong side passage . Somehow a hole had opened in the side of the pithole and he had followed it blindly . He gathered himself and thrust upward , striving for purchase . He struggled up the incline , and dug in with his toes . Another long ripple passed through the tube . The steady hand of gravity forced him down , but he slowly worked his way forward . Sweat stung his eyes . After a few minutes his hands found the lip , and he quickly hoisted himself over it , into the horizontal tunnel above . He found a tangle of lines and tugged at them . They gave  | with a slight resistance . This was the way out , he was sure of it . He began wriggling forward , and suddenly the world tilted , stretched , lifted him high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lost his breath . The tube flexed again , rising up in front of him and dropping away behind . He dug his hands in and held on . The pithole arched , coiling , and squeezed him . Spongy flesh pressed at his head and he involuntarily held his breath . His faceplate was wrapped in it , and his world became fine-veined , purple , marbled with lacy fat . Slowly , slowly the pressure ebbed away . He felt a dull aching in his side . There was a subdued tremor beneath him . As soon as he gained maneuvering room , he crawled urgently forward , kicking viciously . The lines led him forward . The passage flared outward and he increased his speed . He kept up a steady pace of pulling hands , gouging elbows , thrusting knees and toes . The weight around him seemed bent upon expelling , imparting momentum , ejecting . So it seemed , as the flesh tightened behind him and opened before . He tried the helmet microphone again , but it was still inert . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way in , had been in the wall . Now it formed a bump in the floor . He scrambled over its slickness and continued on . He was so intent upon motion and momentum that he did not recognize the end . Suddenly the walls converged again and he looked around frantically for another exit . There was none . Then he noticed the rings of cartilage and stringy muscle . He pushed at the knotted surface . It gave , then relaxed even more . He shoved forward and abruptly was halfway out , suspended over the churning water . VIII . The muscled iris gripped him loosely about the waist . Puffing steadily , he stopped to rest . He squinted up at the forgiving sun . Around him was a harshly lit world of soundless motion . Currents swirled meters below . He could feel the brown hillside of the Drongheda shift slowly . He turned to see ?  | The Drongheda was splitting in two . But no , no The bulge was another Drongheda close by moving . At the same moment another silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkening water , waving . Pale mist shrouded the sea . Reginri worked his way out and onto the narrow rim of the pithole . He took a grip at it and lowered himself partway down toward the water . Arms extended , he let go and fell with a splash into the ocean . He kept his balance and lurched away awkwardly on legs of cotton . Vanleo reached out a steadying hand . The man motioned at the back of his helmet . Reginri frowned , puzzled , and then realized he was motioning toward the emergency com cable . He unspooled his own cable and plugged it into the shoulder socket on Vanleo 's skinsuit. " ? damned lucky . Did n't think I 'd see you again . But it 's fantastic , come see it . " " What ? I got ? " " I understand them now . I know what they 're here for . It 's not just communication , I do n't think that , but that 's part of it too . They 've ? " " Stop babbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vanleo said , regaining his breath . " Or started to . We did n't notice that another Drongheda had surfaced , was moving into the shallows . " " I saw it . I did n't think ? " " I climbed up to the second pithole before I saw . I was busy with the cables , you know . You were getting good traces and I wanted to ? " " Let 's get away , come on . " The vast bulks above them were moving . " No , no , come see . I think my guess is right , these shallows are a natural shelter for them . If they have any enemies in the sea , large fish or something , their enemies ca n't follow them here into the shallows . So they come here to , to mate and to communicate . They must be terribly lonely , if they ca n't talk to each other in the oceans . So they have to come here to do it . I ? " Reginri studied the man and saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned fool loved these beasts , cared about them , had devoted a life to them and their goddamned mathematics . " Where 's Sasuke ? " " ? and it 's all so natural . I mean , humans communicate and make love , and those are two separate acts . They do n't blend together . But the Drongheda  --  they have it all . They 're like , like ... " The man pulled at Reginri 's shoulder , leading him around the long curv ' of the Drongheda . Two immense burnished hillsides grew out of the shadowed sea . Zeta was setting , and in profile Reginri could see a long dexterous tentacle curling into the air . It came from the mottled patches , like welts , he had seen before . " They extend through those spots , you see . Those are their sensors , what they use to complete the contact . And  --  I ca n't prove it , but I 'm sure  --  that is when the genetic material is passed between them . The mating period . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're getting on the tappers , their stored knowledge fed out . They think we 're another of their own , that must be it . I do n't understand all of it , but ? " " Where 's Sasuke ? " " ? but the first one , the one you were inside , recognized the difference as soon as the second Drongheda approached . They moved together and the second one extruded that tentacle . Then ? " Reginri shook the other man roughly . " Shut up ! Sasuke ? " Vanleo stopped , dazed , and looked at Reginri . " I 've been telling you . It 's a great discovery , the first real step we 've taken in this field . We 'll understand so much more once this is fully explored . " Reginri hit him in the shoulder . Vanleo staggered . The glassy , pinched look of his eyes faded . He began to lift his arms . Reginri drove his gloved fist into Vanleo 's faceplate . Vanleo toppled backward . The ocean swallowed him . Reginri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he struggled up . A wave foamed over him . He stumbled , turned , saw Reginri.  | Reginri moved toward him . " No . No , " Vanleo said weakly . " If you 're not going to tell me ? " " But I , I am . " Vanleo gasped , leaned forward until he could brace his hands on his knees . " There was n't time . The second one came up on us so , so fast . " " Yeah ? " " I was about ready to go inside . When I saw the second one moving in , you know , the only time in thirty years , I knew it was important . I climbed down to observe . But we needed the data , so Sasuke went in for me . With the tapper cables . " Vanleo panted . His face was ashen . " When the tentacle went in , it filled the pithole exactly , Tight . There was no room left , " he said . " Sasuke . . . was there . Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him and he slipped . The waters tumbled him backward . Dazed , he regained his footing on the slick rocks and began stumbling blindly toward the bleak shore , toward humanity . The ocean lapped around him , ceaseless and unending . IX . Belej sat motionless , unmindful of the chill . " Oh my God , " she said . " That was it , " he murmured . He stared off into the canyon . Zeta Reticuli sent slanting rays into the layered reddening mists . Air squirrels darted among the shifting shadows . " He 's crazy , " Belej said simply . " That Leo is crazy . " " Well . . . " Reginri began . Then he rocked forward stiffly and stood up . Swirls of reddish cloud were crawling up the canyon face toward them . He pointed . " That stuff is coming in faster than I thought . " He coughed . " We 'd better get inside . " Belej nodded and came to her feet . She brushed the twisted brown grass from her legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she said softly , " I think you ought to put it from your mind . "  | " It 's hard . I ... " " I know . I know . But you can push it far away from you , forget it happened . That 's the best way . " " Well , maybe . " " Believe me . You 've changed since this happened to you . I can feel it . " " Feel what ? " " You . You 're different . I feel a barrier between us . " " I wonder , " he said slowly . She put her hand on his arm and stepped closer , an old , familiar gesture . He stood watching the reddening haze swallowing the precise lines of the rocks below . " I want that screen between us to dissolve . You made your contribution , earned your pay . Those damned people understand the Drongheda now ? " He made a wry , rasping laugh . " We 'll never grasp the Drongheda . What we get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of what we are . We ca n't sense anything totally alien . " " But ? " " Vanleo saw mathematics because he went after it . So did I , at first . Later ... " He stopped . A sudden breeze made him shiver . He chenched his fists . Clenched . Clenched . How could he tell her ? He woke in the night , sweating , tangled in the bedclothes , muttering incoherently . . . but they were not nightmares , not precisely . Something else . Something intermediate . " Forget those things , " Belej said soothingly . Reginri leaned closer to her and caught the sweet musk of her , the dry crackling scent of her hair . He had always loved that . She frowned up at him . Her eyes shifted intently from his mouth to his eyes and then back again , trying to read his expression . " It will only trouble you to recall it . I  --  I 'm sorry I asked you to tell it . But remember " ? she took both his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . It can be ... " Something made him look beyond her . At the gathering fog .  | And at once he sensed the shrouded abyss open below him . Sweeping him in . Gathering him up . Into- a thick red foam lapping against weathered granite towers- an ellipsoidal sun spinning soundlessly over a silvered , warping planet- watery light- cloying strands , sticky , a fine-spun coppery matrix that enfolded him , warming- glossy sheen of polyhedra , wedged together , mass upon mass- smooth bands of moisture playing lightly over his quilted skin- a blistering light shines through him , sets his bones to humming resonance -- pressing --  coiling Beckoning . Beckoning . When the moment had passed , Reginri blinked and felt a salty stinging in his eyes . Every day the tug was stronger , the incandescent images sharper . This must be what Vanleo felt , he was sure of it . They came to him now even during the day . Again and again , the grainy texture altering with time .. . He reached out and enfolded Belej in his arms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper . " Vanleo called today . He ... I 'm going . I 'm going back . " He heard her quick intake of breath , felt her stiffen in his arms . His attention was diverted by the reddening fog . It cloaked half the world and still it came on . There was something ominous about it and something inviting as well . He watched as it engulfed trees nearby . He studied it intently , judging the distance . The looming presence was quite close now . But he was sure it would be all right .  | paged deleted  | paged deleted  | paged deleted  | It had all gone very well , Brooks told himself . Very well indeed . He hurried along the side corridor , his black dress shoes clicking hollowly on the old tiles .

" " They heard . Several commented on it . " " Good . " Hart seemed satisfied , but still strangely depressed . " But you must admit , that is n't what you promised . " Hart said sourly , " Research ca n't be done to a schedule . " Brooks had been pacing up and down the lanes of pottery . He stopped suddenly , pivoted on one foot , and pointed a finger at Hart . " You said you 'd have a voice . That was the promise . Back in ' 98 you said you would have something for the BiMillennium celebration , and ? " " Okay , okay . " Hart waved away the other man 's words . " Look ? " Brooks strode to a window and jerked up the blinds . From this high up in the Arts and Industries Building the BiMillennial Vault was a flat concrete slab sunk in the Washington mud ; it had rained the day before . Now bulldozers scraped piles of gravel and mud into the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be laid . The Vault itself was already sheathed in sleeves of concrete , shockresistant and immune to decay . The radio beacons inside were now set . Their radioactive power supply would automatically stir to life exactly a thousand years from now . Periodic bursts of radio waves would announce to the world of the TriMillennium that a message from the distant past awaited whoever dug down to find it . Inside the Vault were artifacts , recordings , everything the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian thought important about their age . The coup of  | the entire Vault was to have been a message from the First Millennium , the year 1000 A.D. Hart had promised them something far better than a mere written document from that time . He had said he could capture a living voice . " See that ? " Brooks said with sudden energy . " That Vault will outlast everything we know  --  all those best-selling novels and funny plays and amazing scientific discoveries . They 'll all be dust , when the Vault 's opened . " " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can say ? " " Well , sure , I ? " " The Vault was important . And I was stupid enough " ? he rounded on Hart abruptly , anger flashing across his face ? " to chew up some of the only money we had for the Vault to support you . " Hart took an involuntary step backward . " You knew it was a gamble . " " I knew . " Brooks nodded ruefully . " And we waited , and waited ? " " Well , your waiting is over , " Hart said , something hardening in him . " What ? " " I 've got it . A voice . " " You have ? " In the stunned silence that followed Hart bent over casually and picked up a dun-colored water jug from the racks . An elaborate , impossibly large-winged orange bird was painted on its side . Hart turned the jug in his hands , hefting its weight . " Why . . . it 's too late for the Vault , of course , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad the idea paid off . That 's great . " " Yeah . Great . " Hart smiled sourly . " And you know what it 's worth ? Just about this much ? " He took the jug in one hand and threw it . It struck the far wall with a splintering crash . Shards flew like a covey of frightened birds that scattered through the long ranks of pottery . Each landed with a ceramic tinkling . " What are you doing ? " Brooks began , dropping to his knees without thinking to retrieve a fragment of the jug . " That jug was worth ? "  | " Nothing , " Hart said . " It was a fake . Almost everything the Egyptians sent was bogus . " " But why are you . . . you said you succeeded ... " Brooks was shaken out of his normal role of Undersecretary to the Smithsonian . " I did . For what it 's worth . " " Well . . . show me . " Hart shrugged and beckoned Brooks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glazed pottery , ignoring the extravagant polished shapes that flared and twisted in elaborate , artful designs , the fruit of millennia of artisans . Glazes of feldspath , lead , tin , ruby salt . Jasperware , softpaste porcelain , albarelloa festooned with ivy and laurel , flaring lips and serene curved handles . A galaxy of the work of the First Millennium and after , assembled for Hart 's search . " It 's on the wheel , " Hart said , gesturing . Brooks walked around the spindle fixed at the center of a horzontal disk . Hart called it a potter 's wheel but it was a turntable , really , firmly buffered against the slightest tremor from external sources . A carefully arranged family of absorbers isolated the table from everything but the variable motor seated beneath it . On the turntable was an earthenware pot . It looked unremarkable to Brooks just a dark red oxidized finish , a thick lip , and a rather crude handle , obviously molded on by a lesser artisan . " What 's its origin ? " Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Southern England . " Hart was logging instructions into the computer terminal nearby . Lights rippled on the staging board . " How close to the First Mil ? " " Around 1280 A.D. , apparently . " " Not really close , then . But interesting . " " Yeah . " Brooks stooped forward . When he peered closer he could see the smooth finish was an illusion . A thin thread ran around the pot , so fine the eye could scarcely make it out . The lines wound in a tight helix . In the center of each delicate line was a fine hint of blue . The jug had been incised with a precise point . Good ; that was exactly what Hart had  | said he sought . It was an ancient , common mode of decoration  --  incise a seemingly infinite series of rings , as the pot turned beneath the cutting tool . The cutting tip revealed a differently colored dye underneath , a technique called sgraffito , the scratched . It could never have occurred to the Islamic potters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devising the first phonograph records . Hart pressed a switch and the turntable began to spin . He watched it for a moment , squinting with concentration . Then he reached down to the side of the turntable housing and swung up the stylus manifold . It came up smoothly and Hart locked it in just above the spinning red surface of the pot . " Not a particularly striking item , is it ? " Brooks said conversationally . " No . " " Who made it ? " " Near as I can determine , somebody in a co-operative of villages , barely Christian . Still used lots of pagan decorations . Got them scrambled up with the cross motif a lot . " " You 've gotten . . . words ? " " Oh , sure . In early English , even . " " I 'm surprised crude craftsmen could do such delicate work . " " Luck , some of it . They probably used a pointed wire , a new technique that 'd been imported around that time from Saxony . " The computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , thumbed in instructions , and turned to watch the stylus whir in a millimeter closer to the spinning jug . " Damn , " Hart said , glancing at the board . " Correlator 's giving hash again . " Hart stopped the stylus and worked at the board . Brooks turned nervously and paced , unsure of what his attitude should be toward Hart . Apparently the man had discovered something , but did that excuse his surliness ? Brooks glanced out the window , where the last crowds were drifting away from the Vault dedication and strolling down the Mall . There was a reception for the Board of Regents in Georgetown in  | an hour . Brooks would have to be there early , to see that matters were in order " If you 'd given me enough money , I could 've had a Hewlett-Packard . Would n't have to fool with this piece of ... " Hart 's voice trailed off . Brooks had to keep reminding himself that this foultempered , scrawny man was reputed to be a genius . If Hart had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have risked valuable Vault funding . Apparently Hart 's new method for finding correlations in a noisy signal was a genuine achievement . The basic idea was quite old , of course . In the 1960s a scientist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York had applied a stylus to a rotating urn and played the signal through an audio pickup . Out came the wreeee sound of the original potter 's wheel where the urn was made . It had been a Roman urn , made in the era when hand-turned wheels were the best available . The Natural History " recording " was crude , but even that long ago they could pick out a moment when the potter 's hand slipped and the rhythm of the wreeee faltered . ' Hart had read about that urn and seen the possibilities . He developed his new multiple-correlation analysis  --  a feat of programming , if nothing else  --  and began searching for pottery that might have acoustic detail in its surface . The sgraffito technique was the natural choice . Potters sometimes used fine wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incising wire  --  passing footfalls , even the tiny acoustic push of sound waves  --  could leave its trace on the surface of the finished pot . Buried.among imperfections and noise , eroded by the random bruises of history .. . " Got it , " Hart said , fatigue creeping into his voice . " Good . Good . " " Yeah . Listen . " The stylus whirred forward . It gently nudged into the jug , near the lip . Hart flipped a switch and studied the rippling , dancing yellow lines on the board oscilloscope . Electronic archaeology . " There . " A high-pitched whining came from the speaker , punctuated by hollow , deep bass thumps.  | " Hear that ? He 's using a foot pump . " " A kick wheel ? " " Right . " " I thought they came later . " " No , the Arabs had them . " There came a clop clop clop , getting louder . It sounded oddly disembodied in the silence of the long room . " What . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Checked it with the equestrian people . They say the horse is unshod , assuming we 're listening to it walk on dirt . Farm animal , probably . Plow puller . " " Ah . " The hoofbeats faded . The whine of the kick wheel sang on . " Here it comes , " Hart whispered . Brooks shuffled slightly . The ranks upon ranks of ancient pottery behind him made him nervous , as though a vast unmoving audience were in the room with them . Thin , distant : " Alf ? " " Aye . " A gruff reply . " It slumps , sure . " " I be oct , man . " A rasping , impatient voice . " T ' art ? " " Busy  --  mark ? " " Ah ha ' wearied o ' their laws , " the thin voice persisted . " Aye  --  so all .

" Brooks looked around , dazed , for a place to sit . " In . . incredible . " " I suppose . " Hart seemed haggard , worn . " They were about to convert to Christianity , were n't they ? " Hart nodded . " They thought they could seal up the  --  what ? wood spirits ? ? they worshiped . Pack them away by blessing the clay or something like that . And that the clay would carry a message to the future ! " " So it did . " " To their sons ' sons ' sons . . . " Brooks paused . " Why are you so depressed , Hart ? This is a great success . " Abruptly Hart laughed . " I 'm not , really . Just , well , manic , I guess . We 're so funny . So absurd . Think about it , Brooks . All that hooey the potter shouted into his damned pot . What did you make of it ? " " Well . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long shot this is  --  that we 'd get to hear it . " " Maybe it was a common belief back then .

Maybe Henry Ford was right  --  history is bunk . " " I do n't see why you 're carrying on this way , Hart . Granted , the message was ... obscure . That unintelligible information about making pottery , and ? " " Tips on keeping sheep . " " Yes , and ? " " Useless , right ? "  | " Well , probably . To us , anyway . The conversation before that was much more interesting . " " Uh huh . Here 's a man who is talking to the ages . Sending what he thinks is most important . And he prattles out a lot of garbage . " " Well , true ... " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hart walked stiffly to the window . Earthmovers crawled like eyeless insects beneath the wan yellow lamps . Dusk had fallen . Their great awkward scoops pushed mounds of mud into the square hole where the Vault rested . " Look at that . " Hart gestured . " The Vault . Our own monument to our age . Passing on the legacy . You , me , the others  --  we 've spent years on it . Years , and a fortune . " He chuckled dryly . " What makes you think we 've done any better ? "  | page deleted  | He had trouble finding it . The blue-white exhaust plume was a long trail of ionized hydrogen scratching a line across the black . It had been a lot harder to locate out here than Central said it would be . Nagara came up on the Redeemer from behind , their blind side . They would n't have any sensors pointed aft . No point in it when you 're on a one-way trip , not expecting visitors and have n't seen anybody for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting off the translight to avoid overshoot . The translight rig was delicate and still experimental and it had already pushed him over seven light-years out from Earth . And anyway , when he got back to Earth there would be an accounting , and he would have to pay off from his profit anything he spent for overexpenditure of the translight hardware . The ramscoop vessel ahead was running hot . It was a long cylinder , fluted fore and aft . The blue-white fire came boiling out of the aft throat , pushing Redeemer along at a little below a tenth of light velocity . Nagara 's board buzzed . He cut in the null-mag system . The ship 's skin , visible outside , fluxed into its superconducting state , gleaming like chrome . The readout winked and Nagara could see on the sim-board his ship slipping like a silver fish through the webbing of magnetic field lines that protected Redeemer . The field was mostly magnetic dipole . He cut through it and glided in parallel to the hot exhaust streamer . The stuff was spitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters to see what he was doing . He came up along the aft section of the ship and matched velocities . The magnetic throat up  | ahead sucked in the interstellar hydrogen for the fusion motors . He stayed away from it . There was enough radiation up there to fry you for good . Redeemer 's midsection was rotating but the big clumsylooking lock aft was stationary . Fine . No trouble clamping on . The couplers seized clang and he used a waldo to manually open the lock . He would have to be fast now , fast and careful . He pressed a code into the keyin plate on his chest to check it . It worked . The slick aura enveloped him , cutting out the ship 's hum . Nagara nodded to himself . He went quickly through the Redeemer 's lock . The pumps were still laboring when he spun the manual override to open the big inner hatch . He pulled himself through in the zero-g with one powerful motion , through the hatch and into a cramped suitup room . He cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Nagara crossed the deck a young man came in from a side hatchway . Nagara stopped and thumped off his protective shield . The man did n't see Nagara at first because he was looking the other way as he came through the hatchway , moving with easy agility . He was studying the subsystem monitoring panels on the far bulkhead . The status phosphors were red but they winked green as Nagara took three steps forward and grabbed the man 's shoulder and spun him around . Nagara was grounded and the man was not . Nagara hit him once in the stomach and then shoved him against a bulkhead . The man gasped for breath . Nagara stepped back and put his hand into his coverall pocket and when it came out there was a dart pistol in it . The man 's eyes did n't register anything at first and when they did he just stared at the pistol , getting his breath back , staring as though he could n't believe either Nagara or the pistol was there . " What 's your name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? I ? " " Your name . Quick . " " I . . . Zak . " " All right , Zak , now listen to me . I 'm inside now and I 'm  | not staying long . I do n't care what you 've been told . You do just what I say and nobody will blame you for it . " " . . nobody . . . ? " Zak was still trying to unscramble his thoughts and he looked at the pistol again as though that would explain things . " Zak , how many of you are manning this ship ? " " Manning ? You mean crewing ? " Confronted with a clear question , he forgot his confusion and frowned . " Three . We 're doing our five-year stint . The Revealer and Jacob and me . " " Fine . Now , where 's Jacob ? " " Asleep . This is n't his shift . " " Good . " Nagara jerked a thumb over his shoulder . " Personnel quarters that way ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off through the whole ship , Zak ? " " No , just on the bridge . " " So I did n't wake up Jacob ? " " I . . . I suppose not . " " Fine , good . Now , where 's the Revealer ? " So far it was working well . The best way to handle people who might give you trouble right away was to keep them busy telling you things before they had time to decide what they should be doing . And Zak plainly was used to taking orders . " She 's in the forest . " " Good . I have to see her . You lead the way , Zak . " Zak automatically half turned to kick down the hatchway he 'd come in through and then the questions came out . " What  --  who are you ? How ? " " I 'm just visiting . We 've got faster ways of moving now , Zak . I caught up with you . " " A faster ramscoop ? But we ? " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun and Zak looked at it a moment and then , still visibly struggling with his confusion , he kicked off and glided down the drift tube . The forest was one-half of a one hundred meter long cylinder , located near the middle of the ship and rotating to give one g . The forest was dense with pines and oak and tall bushes . A fine mist hung over the tree tops , obscuring the  | other half of the cylinder , a gardening zone that hung over their heads . Nagara had n't been in a small cylinder like this for decades . He was used to seeing a distant green carpet overhead , so far away you could n't make out individual trees , and shrouded by the cottonball clouds that accumulated at the zero-g along the cylinder axis . This whole place felt cramped to him . Zak led him along footpaths and into a bamboo-walled clearing . The Revealer was sitting in lotus position in the middle of it . She was wearing a Flatlander robe and cowl just like Zak . He recognized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , wrinkled and wiry , her hands thick and calloused , the fingers stubby , the nails clipped off square . She did n't go rigid with surprise when Nagara came into view and that bothered him a little . She did n't look at the dart pistol more than once , to see what it was , and that surprised him , too . " What 's your name ? " Nagara said as he walked into the bamboo-encased silence . " I am the Revealer . " A steady voice . " No , I meant your name . " " That is my name . " " I mean ? " " I am the Revealer for this stage of our exodus . " Nagara watched as Zak stopped halfway between them and then stood uncertainly , looking back and forth . " All right . When they freeze you back down , what 'll they call you then ? " She smiled at this . " Michele Astanza . " Nagara did n't show anything in his face . He waved the pistol at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit . " " And I prefer you stand . " " Oh . " He watched both of them carefully . " Zak , I 'm going to have to ask you to do a favor for me . " Zak glanced at the Revealer and she moved her head a few millimeters in a nod . He said , " Sure . " " This way . " Nagara gestured with the pistol to the woman . The woman nodded to herself as if this confirmed some- thing and got up and started down the footpath to the right , her steps so soft on the leafy path that Nagara could not hear them over the tinkling of a stream on the overhead side of the cylinder . Nagara followed her . The trees trapped the sound in here and made him jumpy . He knew he was taking a calculated risk by not getting Jacob , too . But the odds against Jacob waking up in time were good and the whole point of doing it this way was to get in and out fast , exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of them together . That was just it  --  he was doing this alone so he could collect the whole fee , and for that you had to take some extra risk . That was the way this thing worked . The forest gave onto some corn fields and then some wheat , all the UV phosphorus netted above . The three of them skirted around the nets and through a hatchway in the big aft wall . Whenever Zak started to say anything Nagara cut him off with a wave of the pistol . Then Nagara saw that with some time to think Zak was adding some things up and the lines around his mouth were tightening , so Nagara asked him some questions about the ship 's design . That worked . Zak rattled on about quintuple-redundant fail-safe subsystems he 'd been repairing until they were at the entrance to the freezing compartment . It was bigger than Nagara had thought . He had done all the research he could , going through old faxes of Redeemer 's prelim designs , but plainly the Flatlanders had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of Redeemer was given over to the freezedown vaults . It was at zero-g because otherwise the slow compression of tissues in the corpses would do permanent damage . They floated in their translucent compartments , like strange fish in endless rows of pale blue-white aquariums . The vaults were stored in a huge array , each layer a cylinder slightly larger than the one it enclosed , all aligned along the ship 's axis . Each cylinder was two compartments thick , a corpse in every one , and the long cylinders extended into the distance until the chilly fog steaming off them blurred the perspective and the eye could not judge the size of the things . Despite himself Nagara was impressed . There were  | thousands upon thousands of Flatlanders in here , all dead and waiting for the promised land ahead , circling Tau Ceti . And with seventy-five more years of data to judge by , Nagara knew something this Revealer could n't reveal : The failure rate when they thawed them out would be thirty percent . They had come out on the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming part . Nagara stopped them and studied the front face of the vault array , which spread away from them radially like an immense spider web . He reviewed the old plans in his head . The axis of the whole thing was a tube a meter wide , the same translucent organiform . Liquid nitrogen flowed in the hollow walls of the array and the phosphor light was pale and watery . " That 's the DNA storage , " Nagara said , pointing at the axial tube . " What ? " Zak said . " Yes , it is . " " Take them out . " " What ? " " They 're in fail-safe self-refrigerated canisters , are n't they ? " " Yes . " " That 's fine . " Nagara turned to the Revealer . " You 've got the working combinations , do n't you ? " She had been silent for some time . She looked at him steadily and said , " I do . " " Let 's have them . " " Why should I give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not really . " He knew she was playing some game but he could n't see why . " You 're carrying DNA material for over ten thousand people . Old genotypes , undamaged . It was n't so rare when you collected it seventy-five years ago but it is now . I want it . " " It is for our colony . " " You 've got enough corpses here . " " We need genetic diversity . " " The System needs it more than you . There 's been a war . A lot of radiation damage . " " Who won ? "  | " Us . The Outskirters . " " That means nothing to me . " " We 're the environments in orbit around the sun , not sucking up to Earth . We knew what was going on . We 're mostly in Barnal spheres . We got the jump on ? " " You 've wrecked each other genetically , have n't you ? That was always the trouble with your damned cities . No place to dig a hole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the man 's face Nagara could tell he was getting to be more insulted than angry  --  outraged at somebody walking in and stealing their future . And from the way his leg muscles were tensing against a foothold Nagara guessed Zak was also getting more insulted than scared , which was trouble for sure . It was a lot better if you dealt with a man who cared more about the long odds against a dart gun at this range than about some principle . Nagara knew he could n't count on Zak ignoring all the Flatlander nonsense the Revealer and others had pumped into him . They hung there in zero-g , nobody moving in the wan light , the only sound a gurgling of liquid nitrogen . The Revealer was saying something and there was another thing bothering Nagara . Some sound , but he ignored it . " How did the planetary enclaves hold out ? " the woman was asking . " I had many friends ? " " They 're gone . " Something came into the woman 's face . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ? " " Abandoned the planets altogether ? Made them unfit to live on ? All for your awful cities ? " and she made a funny jerky motion with her right hand . That was it . When she started moving that way Nagara saw it had to be a signal and he jumped to the left . He did n't take time to place his boots right and so he picked up some spin but the important thing was to get away from that spot fast . He heard a chuung off to the right and a dart smacking into the bulkhead and when he turned his head to the right and up behind him , a burly man with black hair and the same Flatlander robes and a dart gun was coming at him on a glide .  | Nagara had started twisting his shoulder when he leaped and now the differential angular momentum was bringing his shooting arm around . Jacob was already aiming again . Nagara took the extra second to make his shot and allow for the relative motions . His dart gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just right . The man 's face went white and he reached down to pull the dart out but by that time the nerve inhibitor had reached the heart and abruptly Jacob stopped plucking at the dart and his fingers went slack and the body drifted on in the chilly air , smacking into a vault door and coming to rest . Nagara wrenched around to cover the other two . Zak was coming at him . Nagara leaped away , braked . He turned and Zak had come to rest against the translucent organiform , waiting . " That 's a lesson , " Nagara said evenly . " Here 's another . " He touched the keyin on his chest and his force screen flickered on around him , making him look metallic . He turned it off in time to hear the hollow boom that came rolling through the ship like a giant 's shout . " That 's a sample . A shaped charge . My ship set it off two hundred meters from Redeemer . The next one 's keyed to go on impact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything about it . My force field comes on when the charge goes , so it wo n't hurt me . " " We 've never seen such a field , " the woman said unsteadily . " Outskirter invention . That 's why we won . " He did n't bother watching Zak . He looked at the woman as she clasped her thick worker 's hands together and began to realize what choices were left . When she was done with that she murmured , " Zak , take out the canisters . " The woman sagged against a strut . Her robes clung to her and made her look gaunt and old . " You 're not giving us a chance , are you ? " she said . " You 've got a lot of corpses here . You 'll have a big colony out at Tau Ceti . " Nagara was watching Zak maneuver the canisters onto a mobile carrier . The young man was going to be all right now , he could tell that . There was the look of weary defeat about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a strange ecology there will be genetic drift . " " The System has worse problems right now . " " With Earth dead , you people in the artificial worlds are finished , " she said savagely , a spark returning . " That 's why we left . We could see it coming . " Nagara wondered if they 'd have left at all if they 'd known a faster than light drive would come along . But no , it would n't have made any difference . The translight transition cost too much and only worked for small ships . He narrowed his eyes and made a smile without humor . " I know quite well why you left . A bunch of scum-lovers . Purists . Said Earth was just as bad as the cylinder cities , all artificial , all controlled . Yeah , I know . You Flatties sold off everything you had and built this ? " His voice became bitter . " Ransacked a fortune  --  my fortune . " For once she looked genuinely curious , uncalculating . " Yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at Zak . " Yeah . I would 've inherited some of your billions you made out of those smelting patents . " " You ? " " I 'm one of your great-grandsons . " Her face changed . " No . " " It 's true . Stuffing the money into this clunker made all your descendants have to bust ass for a living . And it 's not so easy these days . " " I . . . did n't ... " He waved her into silence . " I knew you were one of the mainstays , one of the rich Flatlanders . The family talked about it a lot . We 're not doing so well now . Not as well as you did , not by a thousandth . I thought that would mean you 'd get to sleep right through , wake up at Tau Ceti . Instead " ? he laughed ? " they 've got you standing watch . " " Someone has to be the Revealer of the word , grandson . " " Great-grandson . Revealer ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid over there , he would 've been alert and I would n't be in here . " She frowned and watched Zak , who was awkwardly shift- ing the squat modular canisters stenciled GENETIC BANK . MAX SECURITY . " We are not military types , " she replied . Nagara grinned . " Right . I was looking through the family records and I thought up this job . I figured you for an easy setup . A max of three or four on duty , considering the size of the life-support systems and redundancies . So I got the venture capital together for a translight and here I am . " " We 're not your kind . Why ca n't you give us a chance , grandson ? " " I 'm a businessman . " She had a dry , rasping laugh . " A few centuries ago everybody thought space colonies would be the final answer . Get off the stinking old Earth and everything 's solved . Athens in the sky . But look at you  --  a paid assassin . A businessman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old ideas . " He watched Zak . " Do n't you see it ? The colony environments are n't a social advance . You need discipline to keep life-support activated . Communication and travel have to be regulated for simple safety . So you do n't get democracies , you get strong men . And then they turned on us  --  on Earth . " " You were out of date , " he said casually , not paying much attention . " Do you ever read any history ? " " No . " He knew this was part of her spiel  --  he 'd seen it on a fax from a century ago  --  but he let her go on to keep her occupied . Talkers never acted when they could talk . " They turned Earth into a handy preserve . The Berbers and Normans had it the same way a thousand years ago . They were seafarers . They depopulated Europe 's coastline by raids , taking what or who they wanted . You did the same to us , from orbit , using solar lasers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He checked the long bore of the axial tube . It was empty . Zak had the stuff secured on the carrier . There was n't any point in staying here any longer than necessary . " Let 's go , " he said . " One more thing , " the woman said . " What ? "  | " We went peacefully , I want you to remember that . We have no defenses . " " Yeah , " Nagara said impatiently . " But we have huge energies at our disposal . The scoop fields funnel an enormous flux of relativistic particles . We could 've temporarily altered the magnetic multipolar fields and burned your sort to death . " " But you did n't . " " No , we did n't . But remember that . " Nagara shrugged . Zak was floating by the carrier ready to take orders , looking tired . The kid had been easy to take , too easy for him to take any pride in doing it . Nagara liked an even match . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . Zak was n't in that league , though . " Let 's go , " he said . The loading took time but he covered Zak on every step and there were no problems . When he cast off from Redeemer he looked around by reflex for a planet to sight on , relaxing now , and it struck him that he was more alone than he had ever been , the stars scattered like oily jewels on velvet were the nearest destination he could have . That woman in Redeemer had lived with this for years . He looked at the endless long night out here , felt it as a shadow that passed through his mind , and then he punched in instructions and Redeemer dropped away , its blue-white arc a fuzzy blade that cut the darkness , and he slipped with a hollow clapping sound into translight . He was three hours from his dropout point when one of the canisters strapped down behind the pilot 's couch gave a warning buzz from thermal overload . It popped open . Nagara twisted around and fumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access drawers a little way out and when he did he saw that inside there was a store of medical supplies . Boxes and tubes and fluid cubes . Cheap stuff . No DNA manifolds . Nagara sat and stared at the complete blankness outside . We could 've temporarily altered the magnetic multipolar fields and burned your sort to death , she had said . Remember that .  | If he went back she would be ready . They could rig some kind of aft sensor and focus the ramscoop fields on him when he came tunneling in through the flux . Fry him good . They must have planned it all from the first . Something about it , about the way she 'd looked , told him it had been the old woman 's idea . The risky part of it had been the business with Jacob . That did n't make sense . But maybe she 'd known Jacob would try something and since she could n't do anything about it she used it . Used it to relax him , make him think the touchy part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think to check inside the stenciled canisters . He looked at the medical supplies . Seventy-three years ago the woman had known they could n't protect themselves from what they did n't know , ships that had n't been invented yet . So on her five year watch she had arranged a dodge that would work even if some System ship caught up to them . Now the Flatlanders knew what to defend against . He sat and looked out at the blankness and thought about that . When he popped out into System space the A47 sphere was hanging up to the left at precisely the relative coordinates and distance he 'd left it . A47 was big and inside there were three men waiting to divide up and classify and market the genotypes . When he told them what was in the canisters it would all be over , his money gone and theirs and no hope of his getting a stake again . And maybe worse than that . Maybe a lot worse . He squinted at A47 as he came in for rendezvous . It looked different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't repaired yet . The skin that had gleamed once was smudged now and twisted gray girders stuck out of the ports . It looked pretty beat up . It was the best high-tech fortress they had and A47 had made the whole difference in the war . It broke the African shield by itself . But now it did n't look like so much . All the dots of light orbiting in the distance were pretty nearly the same or worse and now they were all that was left in the system . Nagara turned his ship about to vector on the landing bay ,  | listening to the rumble as the engines cut in . The console phosphors rippled blue , green , yellow as Central reffed him . This next part was going to be pretty bad . Damned bad . And out there his great-grandmother was on the way still , somebody he could respect now , and for the first time he thought the Flatlanders probably were going to make it . In the darkness of the cabin something about the thought made him smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes one . It is that easy . He finds an Ajax model 34 standing unattended , walks up to it , gives the keying-in code , and says , " Come . Follow me. " " at what pace ? " the robot says in a flat monotone . " Mine , of course , " Gerald replies . He has learned , through an engineer friend , about Ajax 34 's deficiency . Any member of that model will key over to a new voice-directive , without checking its mandates . The manufacturer is correcting this quirk as quickly as possible , of course , but it will take time . The robot whirs along behind him . They go unnoticed in traffic . By the time Gerald gets it home he steps with a new , bouncy verve . The chilled air inside his apartment , usually rather stale and flat , seems crisp . He hurries to the 3D and calls Rebecca . " I got it . " " No ! " But she can see it 's so . " It was easy , dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's your name , little bot ? " The robot squats mutely . " Bot ? " Gerald asks . " Slang for robot . You ask him . " " What is your name , Ajax 34 ? " " that does not lie . within my . decision matrix . " " Well , I 'll name you ... " " Bot , " Rebecca puts in . " Bot . It fits . " " You mean , " Gerald remarks , " like that dog of yours , named Dog . " " Of course . It fits . "  | At first Gerald renders the Bot functional at simple tasks : sweeping with a broom , taking out the garbage , washing windows . The arms articulate well . Early on the Bot seems , for Gerald 's tastes , overly concerned  --  indeed , obsessed  --  with its germanium transistors and their well being . " should i be . receiving . conflicting logexes ? " " How do I know ? " " there are nonlinear . aspects . " " You feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think your ex-owners can trace you ? " " i calculate low probability . " " Great ! " Gerald claps his hands in the echoing volume of his apartment . " We 're going to have a lot of fun with you . " " task mandate ? " " What ? " " i require . task mandate . " " Oh . Yes . You can cook , I guess . " " i am. programmable . " " How well ? " " no referent scale . available . " " Oh . Well , get on into the kitchen . " " mandate ? " " Try some Heat ' n Serve Pigs-In-A-Blanket . " Gerald is lying on his flexcushion watching The Iliad and the Ecstasy when the doorbell chimes . He opens the door . Rebecca sweeps in , her balloon sleeves flapping , her eyebrows arched . " Guess . " " I never can . " " I 've snatched one myself . " " No . " But she has : behind her rolls an orange box sprouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indifference . " " Nonsense . " " Wait . " She holds his attention with a needle-fine fingernail which lands delicately on his shoulder . " I pretended I was n't interested in 42 here at all . I just looked in shop  | windows and ignored 42 when it came by . That put it off guard . " " Morris specifically said ? " " Who cares ? I think these poor things are programmed to be suspicious . So I worked my way over to it and whispered the key-in and . .. " He runs his fingers through her Stephens Carmin hair . It crackles . " You 're great , " Gerald says roughly . " i am unmandated . " Gerald frowns . " Ca n't you help 42 ? " " it is also . unmandated . " " Hey . Rebecca . " She unplugs from her helmet , where she was watching a simulated bullfight  --  no actual killing was allowed , of course , but you forgot all about that while it was on  --  and scowls at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my car . " " They 've done that . " " you experience . difficulty . over this . " " Shut up . " Gerald gazes around , gets up , walks from room to room . The Bot hums along behind him . Its arms move energetically , making a rasping whisper . " Trouble is , there 's just not much to do in this place . " Rebecca does not hear him ; she is back under the helmet . Gerald knocks over an ashtray , making a silent powdery splash on the off-white carpet  --  he and Rebecca had been smoking again , illegally . 42 rolls over to suck away the blotch . The trouble is , his apartment is too simply decorated . Gerald studies it . His primary embellishment of the anonymous plaster walls is a print of Jakopii 's famous Toward a Unified Philosophy of Ice Cream . He rather likes it , but one print is n't enough , not by a long shot . And there are fly specks on the print , right in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some droll touches of his own here and there . In the bathroom ( an important place in an apartment , intimate but seen by nearly every guest ) hangs a fake  | mantelpiece with an impressive flintlock rifle mounted over it . And there are some amusing towels . But not enough , no . " I think I 'll augment them . " " Ummmm ? " Rebecca murmurs from under the helmet . " I 'll buy them some memorex cubes . " " Why ? " " We 'll have them learn interior decoration . That way I wo n't have to hire anybody . " " They 're just machines , Gerald . " He drops his spoon on the table . With a rattle it spatters Flecko on the ceramic tabletop . " But all I said , Gerald , was that it 's theft . " " I know . I know you said that . I just do n't agree . " " There 's no reason to get mad . " " Well look , Mary did it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did n't even get a fine . " " That was before more of us did it . " " Only a few more . " " Well , Betty has one . " " She does ? " He is genuinely surprised . " Hermann , too . " He remembers Hermann , a fellow with funny tapered sideburns who invariably wore a maroon ascot whenever there was the slightest reason . What the hell was a guy like that doing , stealing an Ajax ? " In fact , I probably know at least five others ? " " Okay , " he says , grimacing into his coffee cup , where he can see his smoothed and warped amber reflection . " If there are that many of us , then they for sure ca n't prosecute . " He smiles . This seems a nice flip-flop on his previous argument , and it makes sense . The Bot trundles over . " You find your coffee unaccept-able ? " " Ummmm. " " a pinch of . salt . added to instant . coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Go away , " Gerald murmurs , thinking about the cops .  | Gerald arrives home early . Rebecca , by prearrangement , is off work today and has used her key . She waves from under the helmet . " I got that last of the memorex cubes , " he reports . " Our little friends can finish their redecoration course . " t " Good . Good , " she calls . " I also brought us a little wisdom . " He displays a dark bottle of Concannon ' 96 . Rebecca is enmeshed in her helmet show . He walks into the kitchen and finds a corkscrew . It goes in smoothly enough , biting the waxy cork , but as he twists the top the corkscrew begins a high-pitched , irritati ing squeal against the glass neck . " Let me , sir , " the Bot says , appearing in the kitchen . Gerald surrenders the bottle , smiling stiffly so that a thin line of teeth show , and glad that Rebecca is not there after all . While the Bot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald and Rebecca play bridge . Gerald finds a program available through the Yellow Faxes which provides a stimulated bridge team . The sim works well , analyzing the level of their game accurately and matching  --  but not exceeding  --  them . Gerald improves more rapidly than Rebecca . He has a certain expansive feeling whenever the sim program is forced to pause , recalibrate for Gerald , and then stutter out its next play . It hesitates for a full twenty seconds when it first realizes Gerald has learned to count all fifty-two cards and employ this in his play . Before resuming play the faxscreen flashes that it must charge more for this level of tactics . Rebecca , who has only now begun to keep track of who has which trumps , bites her lavender lip . Gerald ignores the Bot and 42 , who are chuffing solemnly as they maneuver , and concentrates on the fax display . He enjoys keeping track of tricks , calculating a finesse ; inventing elaborate ruses to fool the sim . But Rebecca loses interest . She returns to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today beginning Case History MCXVII . Gerald plays on , paying a bit more for the fax to handle three hands , and works steadily through several rubbers , reacting quickly to whatever the sim does , moving smoothly , snapping the cards down .  | They make love while the robots wait in a corner of the newly arranged bedroom . The Bot and 42 stand impassive , their locomotion meshes inactivated . The air in the room seems thick and layered , despite the steady breath puffing from the air conduits . He and Rebecca intertwine rhythmically , as though each is struggling with some difficulty to push the other up a common steep hillside . They study the new living room . " Mmmmmm , " Rebecca says noncommittally . " Like the concept , " Gerald pronounces . " Like the whole thing . Yeah . That alcove , though " ? pointing ? " looks like something a clerk-typist would think up . " " Ummmm . " " Rebecca , they 've studied all the memorexes . These are good designs . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You heard that somewhere , " he says accusingly . " Mmmmmmmmmm , " she admits . One afternoon , when Gerald comes early to the apartment , he finds them attempting some new task by interlocking their perceptual centers . The Bot has backed up to 42 and unhinged his rear module , for easier access . 42 has flipped up the lid of its input center and the Bot presses against it . Gerald frowns . Since he did not , of course , get an owner 's manual with the Bot , he ca n't diagnose what the trouble might be . 42 whirs . The Bot makes a crunching noise . Why are they doing this , coupled together in  --  of all places  --  a closet ? And with their perceiving lobes active , but no link to the outside sensors , Gerald wonders , what are they receiving ? It is a puzzle . " Christ . " " What now ? " Rebecca says absently . " This fax is about Betty . " " You mean Betty ? " " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , what else ? "  | " Well , I said it was theft , did n't I ? " " Yeah . " " Now , do n't go all Bogart on me . " " Uh huh . " " Can she get off with a fine , do you suppose ? " " Probably not . A lot depends on this court ruling coming up soon . " " You mean the man who had three of them ? " " Yeah , have n't you been keeping up ? He 's fighting it . " " But he 's guilty . " " Scan the fax . Remember that lower court opinion about , about automaton volition , they called it ? " " No . You know I ca n't ? " " You should , Rebecca , you ? " " It 's jargon , Gerald . " " Listen . " " Oh  --  okay . " " This fellow  --  the one who 's banging on the door of the high courts now  --  he 's disputing that ruling from three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , alive . " " Oh , yes . He says the Ajaxes want to stay with him . " " Yeah , what garbage . Real garbage . He takes a chance , he pays the price , is the way I see it . " He stands up , kicks 42 lightly in its side as it purrs past , smiles . " Well , I 'd rather we did n't get caught . " He sucks in his stomach and shrugs elaborately . " No telling . " He is feeling very good , but he does n't tell Rebecca that . The Bot squeaks slightly as it rolls in from the kitchen . " your Roast ' n Boast . is ready , " it says . Gerald nods and grins , the skin around his eyes crinkling with inner warmth . Gerald buys a billiard table , using the money he saved by having the machines do his redecoration , and spends long hours around it . He enjoys sighting down the long stick , tapping the ball just right with the blue-chalked tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a linear exercise of exact momenta and angles , a Euclidean world , though of course he does not think of it in those terms . The balls move in their own universe , intersecting with a classical click .  | " Do you mind if I ask you a question ? " Rebecca says to the Bot. " you just . did . " " Oh . " Her contact lenses seek out the ceramic gleam of its sensors . " I , I liked the mayonnaise curry sauce . " The Bot says nothing . " What I mean is , do you want to stay with us ? " " i must . " " Oh . " While the Bot and 42 are putting together his exercise machine , Gerald paces the vinyl-layered living room . " It needs something , " he says at last , decisively . " What ? " " The walls . " " Have the bots repaint . " " Right . Right . " He spends some time aligning his thoughts in the billiards room and then approaches the Bot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " i would . say an amber . tending toward . yellow . " " Uh . Really ? " " with elements of . green . restful to the . human eye . " " Does n't 42 have any opinion about this ? " " no . " His thighs clench , relax , clench again as he rides the exercise machine . He has to get into better physical shape . All this apartment living is bad for a man . Softens him up . He has to be pretty quick if they 're going to keep a step ahead of the cops , he thinks , grimacing with some satisfaction . He puffs and pants heavily and the acoustically sophisticated walls recommended by the Bot and gummed into place by 42 absorb the sound utterly , hushing the room . When he finishes and walks out , mulling over a calculation of term insurance in his head , Rebecca is watching Quips and Barbs on the helmet . Gerald finds the Bot and 42 carefully applying yellow paint to a corner of the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing at a round green mark amid the yellow . " the black hole . which is thought to . be the energy . source . for Cygnus A. " " Cygnus who ? " " a promiment double . radio source . the three emission . regions are connected by a. supersonically. relativistic. flow originating . above the poles of . the black . hole . " " What 's it doing on my wall ? " " it is a preferred . design . scheme . implications of the infinite ? " " Okay . We 'll see how it works out . What 's the funny thick line through the green ? " " the accretion disk . infalling matter in orbit . around the black hole . its thermal radiation drives . the relativistic wind . which ? " " Yeah , yeah , okay . Boy , the things they teach you . " He goes back to the exercise machine to work on his pectoral muscles . They 've been getting goddamn lardy . He is eating a Carbohyde Flash with some relish when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her prissy lawyer . Just to be safe he peers through the corridor viewer . The hallway is awash in enameled light . He gets a glimpse of a thin man in a brown overcoat and then a wedge of slick plastic looms up , blossoming from the man 's hand upward , toward the viewer . It is an identity card . Metro Police . Officer Axford . " What do you want ? " Gerald says tightly . He senses the Bot come rolling up . He gestures the Bot away with frantic hand-signals . " Moom meh in . Royee ah scerge warrant , " Gerald hears through the double-paneled , deadbolted door . " I , well ? " " Or we 'll kick it in , " comes more clearly . When Gerald opens the heavy door Axford and a short , wiry man brush by him as though he were a butler , muttering a legal formula required by the courts for cases like this , slurring the words so he ca n't make them out . They dash into the kitchen where 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls , " Here 's one box all right , " and Axford swerves for the bedrooms . The wiry one stays with 42 and begins to recite a set piece about rights ; but Gerald follows Axford . " What ? What ? " Rebecca calls shrilly from the bedroom , but already Axford is coming out , heading down the hallway . He jerks open the bathroom door . The Bot is struggling with the rifle mounted over the fake mantelpiece , trying to pull it down . " Stop , " Gerald says , not sure who he means . " but it must . go off . " says the Bot . " It 's a fake rifle ! " Gerald cries . Axford has drawn a pistol , but it does not go off either . The Bot becomes still . " We nailed you good on this one , " Axford says happily , holstering his pistol . " How did you find us ? " Rebecca wrings out the words . " Targets of opportunity . We have our sources , " Axford murmurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure . Theft ? " " a needful . display . " The Bot produces two triangular embossed licenses . At first Axford wo n't believe the triangles are authentic , but a careful check of their acute angles reveals the proper validation . The licenses prove conclusive ownership of 42 and the Bot by Rebecca and Gerald , respectively . Gerald gapes at this but says nothing , even when Axford and the other man apologize and help fit the rifle back into its moorings . Soon they have backed out the front door , still apologizing and explaining what a rare event an error like this is , in these days of improved surveillance and sensors , and then they are gone . Gerald finds the Bot adjusting a receptor which was damaged in the scuffle . " Where 'd those licenses come from ? " " i manufactured . them . clearly they would . be needed . " The next day , as he waits for 42 to warm up some Bite-alots , Gerald notices the Cygnus A design again . The accretion disk is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new angle . This disturbs him but he does not mention the matter .  | Gerald walks into the bedroom . The Bot is there , and an Ajax 38 , a square metallic-gray case with seven arms . " Hey , " he says , trying to think . " i have snatched . a 38. " the Bot declares . " How can you . . . ? " Gerald begins , but stops , not wanting to look ridiculous . " Well , you 've got a pretty heavy work load around here . I 'm sure you can use the help . " He pats the Bot affectionately . He says to Rebecca later , " Imagine that ! Stealing his own bot . " He shakes his head . " Helluya inventive little guy . " " Ummm . Hummm . " The newcomer , 38 , is doing some FryUps . Rebecca is tuned in on Westernciv Adventures . Gerald flexes in his exercise machine , because you never know if the cops are going to come back . The Bot and 42 have tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green where synchrotron radiation is suspected ) , to agree with the newest observations of long-baseline radio interferometry . The occasional noise from Westernciv Adventures does not disturb them . They paint with flourishes , splashing on the yellows in great swooping swipes . The Bot twirls his brush adroitly click click , adding fuzzy red patches for the high-density gas clouds ringing the disk . Blending them in gracefully , smoothly , whirring whirring , with the deep yellow of space . Dotting in stars as sharp , brittle , purple dots . 42 purrs beside him . Gerald is alone with his exercises . He clenches arms , thighs , pectorals . Thinks of the bastard Axford . Pumps the gyrating wheels , tugs the bars , his limbs articulating well . Clickclick . Clickclick.  | paged deleted  | paged deleted  | They came into the locker room with a babble of random talk , laughter , and shouts . There was a rolling bass undertone , gruff and raw . Over it the higher feminine notes ran lightly , warbling , darting . The women had a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company of men . There were a dozen of them and they shed their clothes quickly and efficiently , all modesty forgotten long ago , their minds already focused on the job to come . " You up for this , Nick ? " Jake asked , yanking off his shorts and clipping the input sockets to his knees and elbows . His skin was red and callused from his years of linked servo work . " Think I can handle it , " Nick replied . " We 're hitting pretty dense plasma already . There 'll be plenty of it pouring through the throat . " He was big but he gave the impression of lightness and speed , trim like a boxer , with broad shoulders and thick wrists . " Lots of flux , " Jake said . " Easy to screw up . " " I did n't get my rating by screwing up ' cause some extra ions came down the tube . " " Yeah . You 're pretty far up the roster , as I remember , " Jake said , eyeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last time I looked , " Faye put in from the next locker . She laughed , a loud braying that rolled through the locker room and made people look up . " Bet ' at 's what 's botherin ' you , uh , Jake ? " Jake casually made an obscene gesture in her general direction and went on . " You feelin ' OK , Nick ? "  | " What you think I got , clenchrot ? " Nick spat out with sudden ferocity . " Just had a cold , is all . " Faye said slyly , " Be a shame to prang when you 're so close to winnin ' , movin ' on up . " She tugged on her halter and arranged her large breasts in it . Nick glanced at her . Trouble was , you work with a woman long enough and after a while , she looked like just one more competitor . Once he 'd thought of making a play for Faye ? she really did look fairly good sometimes  --  but now she was one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got half a chance . Point was , he never gave her  --  or anybody else  --  a chance to come up on him from some funny angle , throw him some unexpected momentum . He studied her casual , deft movements , pulling on the harness for the connectors . Still , there was something about her ... . " You get one more good run , " Faye said slyly , " you gon na get the promotion . ' At 's what I 'd say . " " What matters is what they say upstairs , on A deck . " " Touchy , touchy , tsk tsk , " Jake said . He could n't resist getting in a little gig . Nick knew . Not when Jake knew it might get Nick stirred up a little . But the larger man stayed silent , stolidly pulling on his neural hookups . Snick , the relays slide into place and Nick feels each one come home with a percussive impact in his body , he never gets used to that no matter that it 's been years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really sat down and thought about it he did n't like this job at all , was always shaky before coming down here for his shift . He 'd figured that out at the start , so the trick was , he did n't think about it , not unless he 'd had too much of that ' ponics-processed liquor , the stuff that was packed with vitamin B and C and was n't supposed to do you any damage , not even leave the muggy dregs and ache of a hangover , only of course it never worked quite right because nothing on the ship did anymore . If he let himself stoke up on that stuff he 'd gradually drop out of the conversation at whatever party he was , and go off into a corner somewhere and somebody 'd find him an hour or two later staring at a wall or into his drink , reliving the hours in the tube and thinking about his dad and the grandfather he  | could only vaguely remember . They 'd both died of the of black creeping cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no secret the Main Drive was the worst place in the ship for it , despite all the design specs of fifty-meter rock walls and carbon-steel bulkheads and lead-lined hatches . A man 'd be a goddamn fool if he did n't think about that , sure , but somebody had to do it or they 'd all die . The job came down to Nick from his father because the family just did it , that was all , all the way back to the first crew , the original bridge officers had decided that long before Nick was born , it was the only kind of social organization that the sociometricians thought could possibly work on a ship that had to fly between stars , they all knew that and nobody questioned it any more than they 'd want to change a pressure spec on a seal . You just did n't , was all there was to it . He 'd learned that since he could first understand the church services , or the yearly anniversary of the Blowout up on the bridge , or the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was dying with the black crawling stuff eating him from inside , Nick had learned that good " God , this dump is gettin ' worse every  --  lookit ' at . " Faye pointed . A spider was crawling up a bulkhead , inching along on the ceramic smoothness . " Musta got outta Agro , " somebody put in . " Yeah , do n't kill it . Might upset the whole damn biosphere , an ' they 'd have our fuckin ' heads for it . " A murmur of grudging agreement . " Lookit ' at dumb thing , " Jake said . " Made it alla way up here , musta come through air ducts an ' line feeds an ' who knows what . " He leaned over the spider , eyeing it . It was a good three centimeters across and dull gray . " Pretty as sin , huh ? " Nick tapped in sockets at his joints and tried to ignore Jake . " Yeah . " " Poor thing . Do n't know where in hell it is , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . We 're ' bout to see a whole new age start in this locker room , soon 's Nick here gets his full score . He 'll be the new super an ' we 'll  | be  --  well , hell , we 'll be like this li'l spider here . Just small and havin ' our own tiny place in the big design of Nick 's career , just you think how it 's gon na ? " " Can the shit , " Nick said harshly . Jake laughed . There was a tight feeling in the air . Nick felt it and figured it was something about his trying to get the promotion , something like that , but not worth bothering about . Plenty of time to think about it , once he had finished this job and gotten on up the ladder . Plenty of time then . The gong rang brassily and the men and women finished suiting up . The minister came in and led them in a prayer for safety , the same as every other shift . Nothing different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher plasma densities , sure , Nick thought . But there was no big deal about that . Still , he murmured the prayer along with the rest . Usually he did n't bother . He 'd been to church services as usual , everybody went , it was unthinkable that you would n't , and anyway he 'd never get any kind of promotion if he did n't show his face reg'lar , hunch on up to the altar rail and swallow that wafer and the alky-laced grape juice that went sour in your mouth while you were trying to swallow it , same as a lot of the talk they wanted you to swallow , only you did , you got it down because you had to and without asking anything afterward either , you bet , ' cause the ones who made trouble did n't get anywhere . So he muttered along , mouthing the familiar litany without thinking . The minister 's thin lips moving , rolling on through the archaic phrases , meant less than nothing . When he looked up , each face was pensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship . Nick lies mute and blind and for a moment feels nothing but the numb silence . It collects in him , blotting out the dim rub of the snouts which cling like lampreys to his nerves and muscles , pressing embrace that amplifies every movement , and -- spang-he slips free of the mooring cables , a rush of sight-soundtaste-touch washes over him , so strong and sudden a welter of sensations that he jerks with the impact . He is servo 'd to a thing like an eel that swims and flips and dives into a  | howling dance of protons . The rest of the ship is sheltered safely behind slabs of rock . But the eel is his , the eel is him . It shudders and jerks and twists , skating across sleek strands of magnetic plains . To Nick , it is like swimming . The torrent gusts around him and he feels its pinprick breath . In a blinding orange glare Nick swoops , feeling his power grow as he gets the feel of it . His shiny shelf is wrapped in a cocoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending them gyrating in a mad gavotte , so the heavy particles can not crunch and flare against the slick baked skin . Nick flexes the skin , supple and strong , and slips through the magnetic turbulence ahead . He feels the magnetic lines of force stretch like rubber bands . He banks and accelerates . Streams of protons play upon him . They make glancing collisions with each other but do not react . The repulsion between them is too great and so this plasma can not make them burn , can not thrust them together with enough violence . Something more is needed or else the ship 's throat will fail to harvest the simple hydrogen atoms , fail to kindle it into energy . There ? In the howling storm Nick sees the blue dots that are the keys , the catalyst : carbon nuclei , hovering like sea gulls in an updraft . Split-image phosphors gleam , marking his way . He swims in the streaming blue-white glow , through a murky storm of fusing ions . He watches plumes of carbon nuclei striking the swarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclei . The torrent swirls and screams at Nick 's skin and in his sensors he sees and feels and tastes the lumpy , sluggish nitrogen as it finds a fresh incoming proton and with the fleshy smack of fusion the two stick , they hold , they wobble like raindrops  --  falling  --  merging  --  ballooning into a new nucleus , heavier still : oxygen . But the green pinpoints of oxygen are unstable . These fragile forms split instantly . Jets of new particles spew through the surrounding glow  --  neutrinos , ruddy photons of light , and slower , darker , there come the heavy daughters of the marriage : a swollen , burnt-gold cloud of a bigger variety of nitrogen .  | Onward the process flies . Each nucleus collides millions of times with the others in a fleck-shot swirl like glowing snowflakes . All in the space of a heartbeat . Flakes ride the magnetic field lines . Gamma rays flare and sputter among the blundering motes like fitful fireflies . Nuclear fire lights the long roaring corridor that is the ship 's main drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foam . Ahead he sees the violet points of gravid nitrogen and hears them crack into carbon plus an alpha particle . So in the end the long cascade gives forth the carbon that catalyzed it , carbon that will begin again its life in the whistling blizzard of protons coming in from the forward maw of the ship . With the help of the carbon , an interstellar hydrogen atom has built itself up from mere proton to , finally , an alpha particle  --  a stable clump of two neutrons and two protons . The alpha particle is the point of it all . It flees from the blurring storm , carrying the energy that fusion affords . The ruby-rich interstellar gas is now wedded , proton to proton , with carbon as the matchmaker . Nick feels a rising electric field pluck at him . He moves to shed his excess charge . To carry a cloak of electrons here is fatal . Upstream lies the chewing gullet of the ramscoop ship , where the incoming protons are sucked in and where their kinetic power is stolen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed , brought to rest inside the ship , their streaming energy stored in capacitors . A cyclone shrieks behind him . Nick swims sideways , toward the walls of the combustion chamber . The nuclear burn that flares around him is never pure , can not be pure because the junk of the cosmos pours through here , like barley meal laced with grains of granite . The incoming atomic rain spatters constantly over the fluxlife walls , killing the organic superconductor strands there . Nick pushes against the rubbery magnetic fields and swoops over the mottled yellow-blue crust of the walls . In the flickering lightning glow of infrared and ultraviolet he sees the scaly muck that deadens the magnetic fields and slows the nuclear burn in the throat . He flexes , wriggles , and turns the eel-like form . This brings the electron beam gun around at millimeter range . He fires . A brittle crackling leaps out , onto  | the scaly wall . The tongue bites and gouges . Flakes roast off and blacken and finally bubble up like tar . The rushing proton currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the exposed superconducting threads can begin their own slow pruning of themselves , life casting out its dead . Their long organic chain molecules can feed and grow anew . As Nick cuts and turns and carves he watched the spindly fibers coil loose and drift in eddies . Finally they spin away into the erasing proton storm . The dead fibers sputter and flash where the incoming protons strike them and then with a rumble in his acoustic pickup coils he sees them swept away . Maintenance . Something tugs at him . He sees the puckered scoop where the energetic alpha particles shoot by . They dart like luminous jade wasps . The scoop sucks there in . Inside they will be collected , drained of energy , inducing megawatts of power for the ship , which will drink their last drop of momentum and cast them aside , a wake of broken atoms . Suddenly he spins to the left Jesus , how can  --  he thinks ? and the scoop fields lash him . A megavolt per meter of churning electrical vortex snatches at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though to the ship it is a minor ripple in its total momentum ) and magnetic tendrils claw at his spinning , shiny surfaces . The scoop opening is a plunging , howling mouth . Jets of glowing atoms whirl by him , mocking . The walls near him counter his motion by increasing their magnetic fields . Lines of force stretch and bunch . How did this  --  is all he has time to think before a searing spot blooms nearby . His presence so near the scoop has upset the combination rates there . His eyes widen . If the reaction gets out of control it can burn through the chamber vessel , through the asteroid rock beyond , and spike with acrid fire into the ship , toward the life dome . A brassy roar . The scoop sucks at his heels . Ions run white-hot . A warning knot strikes him . Tangled magnetic ropes grope for him , clotting around the shiny skin . Panic squeezes his throat . Desperately he fires his electron beam gun against the wall , hoping it will give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ions blossom and swell around him ?  | Most of the squad was finished dressing . They were tired and yet the release of getting off work brought out an undercurrent of celebration . They ignored Nick and slouched out of the locker room , bound for families or assignations or sensory jolts of sundry types . A reek of sweat and fatigue diffused through the sluggishly stirring air . The squad laughed and shouted old jokes to each other . Nick sat on the bench with his head in his hands . " I . . . I do n't get it . I was doin ' pretty well , catchin ' the crap as it came at me , an ' then somethin ' grabbed ... " They 'd had to pull him out with a robot searcher . He 'd gone dead , inoperative , clinging to the throat lining , fighting the currents . The surges drove the blood down into your gut and legs , the extra g 's slamming you up against the bulkhead and sending big dark blotches across your vision , purple swarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the transducer mikes , nausea , the ache spreading through your arms It had taken three hours to get him back in , and three more to clean up . A lot of circuitry was fried for good , useless junk . The worst loss was the high-grade steel , all riddled with neutrons and fissured by nuclear fragments . The ship 's foundry could n't replace that , had n't had the rolling mill to even make a die for it in more than a generation . His neuro index checked out okay , but he would n't be able to work for a week . He was still in a daze and the memory would not straighten itself out in his mind . " I du n no , I ... " Faye murmured , " Maybe went a li'l fast for you today . " Jake grinned and said nothing . " Mebbe you could , y'know , use a rest . Sit out a few sessions . " Faye cocked her head at him . Nick looked at both of them and narrowed his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Uh ? No mistake at all . Somebody ? " He knotted a fist . " Hey , nothin ' you can prove , " Jake said , backing away . " I can guarantee that , boy . " " Some bastard , throwin ' me some extra angular when I was n't lookin ' , I ought a ? "  | " Come on , Nick , you got no proof ' a those charges . You know there 's too much noise level in the throat to record what ever'body 's doin ' . " Faye grinned without humor . " Damn . " Nick buried his face in his hands . " I was that close , so damned near to gettin ' that promotion ? " " Yeah . Tsk tsk . You dropped points back there for sure , Nick , burnin ' out a whole unit that way an ' gettin ? " " Shut it . Just shut it . " Nick was still groggy and he felt the anger build in him without focus , without resolution . These two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , same as everybody did when they were bringing another member of the squad down a notch or two . The squad did n't have a lot of love for anybody who looked like they were going to get up above the squad , work their way up . That was the way it was , jobs were hard to change , the bridge liked it stable , said it came out better when you worked at a routine all your life and " Hey , c'm on , let 's get our butts down to the Sniffer , " Faye said . " No use jawin ' ' bout this , is ' ere ? I 'm gettin ' thirsty after all that uh , work . " She winked at Jake . Nick saw it and knew he would get a ribbing about this for weeks . The squad was telling him he had stepped out of line and he would just have to take it . That was just the plain fact of it . He clenched his fists and felt a surge of anger . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still tryin ' to make it up this wall . " He reached out and picked it up in his hand . The little gray thing struggled against him , legs kicking . " Y'know , I hear there 're people over in Comp who keep these for pets , " Faye said . " Could be one of theirs . " " Creepy li'l thing , " Nick said . " You get what you can , " Faye murmured . " Ever see a holo of a dog ? " Nick nodded . " Saw a whole movie about this one , it was a collie , savin ' people an ' all . Now that 's a pet . " They all stared silently at the spider as it drummed steadily on Jake 's hand with its legs . Nick shivered and turned away . Jake held it firmly , without hurting it , and slipped it into a  | pocket . " Think I 'll take it back before Agro busts a gut lookin ' for it . " Nick was silent as the three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way up through the corridors . They took a shortcut along an undulating walkway under the big observation dome . Blades of pale blue light shifted like enormous columns in the air , but they were talking and only occasionally glanced up . The vast ship of which they were a part was heading through the narrow corridor between two major spiral galaxies . On the right side of the dome the bulge of one galaxy was like a whirlpool of light , the points of light like grains of sand caught in a vortex . Around the bright core , glowing clouds of the spiral arms wended their way through the flat disk , seeming to cut through the dark dust clouds like a river slicing through jungle . Here and there black towers reared up out of the confusion of the disk , where masses of interstellar debris had been heaved out of the galactic plane , driven by collisions between clouds , or explosions of young stars . There were intelligent , technological societies somewhere among those drifting stars . The ship had picked up their transmissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had altered course to pass nearby . The two spirals were a binary system , bound together since their birth . For most of their history they had stayed well apart , but now they were brushing within a galactic diameter of each other . Detailed observations in the last few weeks of ship 's time  --  all that was needed to veer and swoop toward the twinned disks  --  had shown that this was the final pass : the two galaxies would not merely swoop by and escape . The filaments of gas and dust between them had created friction over the billions of years past , eroding their orbital angular momentum . Now they would grapple fatally . The jolting impact would be spectacular : shock waves , compression of the gas in the galactic plane , and shortly thereafter new star formation , swiftly yielding an increase in the supernova rate , a flooding of the interstellar medium with high energy particles . The rain of sudden virulent en- ergy would destroy the planetary environments . The two spirals would come together with a wrenching suddenness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on destruction , the collision effectively occurring all over the disks simultaneously in an explosive flare of X-ray and thermal brems-strahlung radiation . Even advanced technologies would be snuffed out by the rolling , searing tide . The disks were passing nearly face-on to each other . In the broad blue dome overhead the two spirals hung like cymbals seen on edge . The ship moved at extreme relativistic velocity , pressing infinitesimally close to light speed , passing through the dim halo of gas and old dead stars that surrounded each galaxy . Its speed compressed time and space . Angles distorted as time ran at a blinding pace outside , refracting images . Extreme relativistic effects made the approach visible to the naked eye . Slowly , the huge disks of shimmering light seemed to swing open like a pair of doors . Bright tendrils spanned the gap between them . Jake was telling a story about two men in CompCatynch section , rambling on with gossip and jokes , trying to keep the talk light . Faye went along with it , putting in a word when Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the disks and suddenly across the dome streaked red and orange bursts . The disks were twisted , distorted by their mutual gravitational tugs , wrenching each other , twins locked in a tightening embrace . The planes of stars rippled , as if a huge wind blew across them . The galactic nuclei flared with fresh fires : ruby , orange , mottled blue , ripe gold . Stars were blasted into the space between . Filaments of raw , searing gas formed a web that spanned the two spirals . This was the food that fed the ship 's engines . They were flying as near to the thick dust and gas of the galaxies as they could . The maw of the ship stretched outward , spanning a volume nearly as big as the galactic core . Streamers of sluggish gas veered toward it , drawn by the onrushing magnetic fields . The throat sucked in great clouds , boosting them to still higher velocity .  | The ship 's hull moaned as it met denser matter . Nick ignores the babble from Jake , knowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how he would run it if he got the promotion : They had to average five thousand cleared square meters a week , minimum , that was a full ten percent of the whole ship 's throat , minus of course the lining areas that were shut down for full repair , call that one thousand square meters on the average , so with the other crews operating on forty-five-hour shifts they could work their way through and give the throat a full scraping in less than a month , easy , even allowing for screwups and malfs and times when the radiation level was too high for even the suits to screen it out . You had to keep the suits up to 99 plus percent operational or you caught hell from upstairs , but the same time they came at you with their specifications reports and never listened when you told them about the delays , that was your problem not theirs and they said so every chance they got , that bunch of blowhard officers up there , descended from the original ship 's bridge officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning after a twelve-year round trip to Centauri , only it had n't worked , they did n't count on the drive freezing up in permanent full-bore thrust , the drive locked in and the deceleration components slowly getting fried by the increased neutron flux from the reactions , until when they finally could taper off on the forward drive the decelerators were finished , beyond repair , and then the ship had nothing to do but drive on , unable to stop or even turn the magnetic gascatchers off , because once you did that the incoming neutral atoms would be a sleet of protons and neutrons that 'd riddle everybody within a day , kill them all . So the officers had said they had to keep going , studying , trying to figure a way to rebuild the decelerators , only nobody ever did , and the crew got older and they flew on , clean out of the galaxy , having babies and quarrels and finally after some murders and suicides and worse , working out a stable social structure in a goddamn relativistic runaway , officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begetting crewmen again , down through five generations now in the creaky old ship that had by now flown through five million  | years of outside-time , so that there was no purpose or dream of returning Earthside any more , only names attached to pictures and stories , and the same jobs to do every day , servicing the weakening stanchions and struts , the flagging motors , finding replacements for every little doodad that fractured , working because to stop was to die , all the time with officers to tell you what new scientific experiment they 'd thought up and how maybe this time it would be the answer , the clue to getting back to their own galaxy  --  a holy grail beloved of the first and second generations that was now , even under high magnification , a mere mottled disk of ruby receding pinprick lights nobody alive had ever seen up close . Yet there was something in what the bridge officers said , in what the scientific mandarins mulled over , a point to their lives here " Let 's stop in this'n , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he followed them into a small inn . Without his noticing it they had left the big observation dome . They angled through a tight , rocky corridor cut from the original asteroid that was the basic body of the whole starship . Among the seven thousand souls in the **26;0;TOOLONG , there were communities and neighborhoods and bars to suit everyone . In this one there were thick veils of smoky euphorics , harmless unless you drank an activating potion . Shifts came and went , there were always crowds in the bar , a rich assortment of faces and ages and tongues . Techs , metalworkers , computer jockeys , manuals , steamfitters , muscled grunt laborers . Cadaverous and silent alesoakers , steadily pouring down a potent brown liquid . Several women danced in a corner , oblivious , singing , rhyming as they went . Faye ordered drinks and they all three joined in the warm feel of the place . The euphorics helped . It took only moments to become completely convinced that this was a noble and notable set of folk . Someone shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick saw in this quick moment an instant of abiding grace : how lovely it was when Faye forgot herself and laughed  | fully , opening her mouth so wide you could see the whole oval cavern with its ribbed pink roof and the arching tongue alive with tension . The heart-stopping blackness at the back led down to depths worth a lifetime to explore , all revealed in a passing moment like a casual gift : a momentary and incidental beauty that eclipsed the studied , long-learned devices of women and made them infinitely more mysterious . She gave him a wry , tossed-off smile . He frowned , puzzled . Maybe he had never paid adequate attention to her , never sensed her dimensions . He strained forward to say something and Jake interrupted his thoughts with , " Hey there , look . Two bridgies . " And there were . Two bridge types , not mere officers but scientists ; they wore the sedate blue patches on their sleeves . Such people seldom came to these parts of the ship ; their quarters , ordained by time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asteroid . " See if you can hear what they 're sayin ' , " Faye whispered . Jake shrugged . " Why should I care ? Faye frowned . " Wan na be a scuzzo dope forever ? " " Aw , stow it , " Jake said , and went to get more beer . Nick watched the scientist nearest him , the man , lift the heavy champagne bottle and empty it . Have to hand it to bioponics , he thought . They keep the liquor coming . The crisp golden foil at the head would be carefully collected , reused ; the beautiful heavy hollow butts of the bottles had doubtless been fondled by his own grandfather . Of celebration there was no end . Nick strained to hear . " Yes , but the latest data shows definitely there 's enough mass , no question . " " Maybe , maybe , " said the other . " Must say I never thought there 'd be enough between the clusters to add up so much ? " " But there is . No doubt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose on your face . Enough mass density between the clusters to close off the universe 's geometry , to reverse the expansion . " Goddamn , Nick thought . They 're talking about the critical mass problem . Right out in public .  | " Yes . My earlier work seems to have been wrong . " " Look , this opens possibilities . " " How ? " " The expansion has to stop , right ? So after it does , and things start to implode back , the density of gas the ship passes through will get steadily greater  --  right ? " Jesus , Nick thought , the eventual slowing down of the universal expansion , billions of years " Okay . " " So we 'll accelerate more , the relativistic rate will get bigger  --  the whole process outside will speed up , as we see it . " Right . " " Then we can sit around and watch the whole thing play out . I mean , shipboard time from now to the implosion of the whole universe , I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ? " Do the calculation . " " Ummm . Maybe so , if we pick up enough mass in the scoop fields . This flyby we 're going through , it helps , too . " " Sure it does . We 'll do more like it in the next few weeks . Look , we 're getting up to speeds that mean we 'll be zooming by a galaxy every day . " " Uh-huh . If we can live a couple more centuries , shipboard time , we can get to see the whole shebang collapse back in on itself . " " Well , look , that 's just a preliminary number , but I think we might make it . In this generation . " Faye said , " Jeez , I ca n't make out what they 're talkin ' about . " " I can , " Nick said . It helped to know the jargon . He had studied this as part of his program to bootstrap himself up to a better life . You take officers , they could integrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxy was evolving just by looking at it , or figure out the gas density ahead of the ship just by squinting at one of the X-ray bands from the detectors . They knew . He would have to know all of that too , and more . So he studied while the rest of the squad slurped up the malt .  | He frowned . He was still stunned , trying to think it through . If the total mass between the clusters of galaxies was big enough , that extra matter would provide enough gravitational energy to make the whole universe reverse its expansion and fall backward , inward , given enough time .. . Jake was back . " Too noisy in ' ere , " he called . " Fergit the beers , bar 's mobbed . Let 's lift ' em . " Nick glanced over at the scientists . One was earnestly leaning forward , her face puffy and purplish , congested with the force of the words she was urging into the other 's ear . He could n't make out any more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical formulas to each other . " Okay , " Nick said . They left the random clamor of the bar and retraced their steps , back under the observation dome . Nick felt a curious elation . Nick knows how to run the squad , knows how to keep the equipment going even if the voltage flickers , he can strip down most suits in under an hour using just plain rack tools , been doing it for forty years , all those power tools around the bay , most of the squad ca n't even turn a nut on a manifold without it has to be pneumatic rrrrrtt quick as you please nevermind the wear on the lubricants lost forever that nobody aboard can synthesize , tools seize up easy now , jam your fingers when they do , give you a hand all swole up for a week , and all the time the squad griping ' cause they have to birddog their own stuff , breadboard new ones if some piece of gear goes bad , complaining ' cause they got to form and fabricate their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you read about the way it was in the first generation , and God help you if a man or woman on the crew gets a fatal injury working in the throat crew , ' cause then your budget is docked for the cost of keeping ' em frozen down , waiting on cures that 'll never come just like Earth will never come , the whole planet 's been dead now a million years prob'ly , and the frozen corpses on board running two percent of the energy budget he read  | somewhere , getting to be more all the time , but then he thinks about that talk back in the bar and what it might mean , plunging on until you could see the whole goddamn end of the universe " Got ta admit we got you that time , Nick , " Jake says as they approach the dome , " smooth as glass I come up on you , you 're so hard workin ' you do n't see nothin ' , I give you a shot of extra spin , man your legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to laugh . ? and livin ' in each other 's hip pockets like this the hell of it was you start to begrudge ever ' little thing , even the young ones , the kids cost too , not that he 's against them , hell , you got to keep the families okay or else they 'll be slitting each other 's throats inside a year , got to remember your grandfather who was in the Third Try on the decelerators , they came near to getting some new magnets in place before the plasma tubulence blew the whole framework away and they lost it , every family 's got some ancestor who got flung down the throat and out into nothing , the kids got to be brought up rememberin ' that , even though the little bastards do get into the bioponic tubes and play pranks , they got not a lot to do ' cept study and work , same as he and the others have done for all their lives , average crewman lasts two hundred years or so now , all got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to Centauri ) , bridge officers maybe even longer , get lots of senso augmentation to help you through the tough parts , and all to keep going , or even maybe get ahead a little like this squad boss thing , he was that close an ' they took it away from him , small-minded bastards scared to shit he might make , what was it , fifty more units of rec credit than they did , not like being an officer or anything , just a job-jockey getting ahead a little , wanting just a scrap , and they gigged him for it and now this big mouth next to his ear is goin ' on , puffing himself up in front of Faye , Faye who might be worth a second look if he could get her out of the shadow of this loudmouthed secondrate  | Jake was in the middle of a sentence , drawling on . Nick grabbed his arm and whirled him around . " Keep laughin ' , you slimy bastard , just keep ? " Nick got a throat hold on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railing of the walkway . Jake struggled but his feet left the floor until he was balanced on the railing , halfway over the twenty-meter drop . He struck out with a fist but Nick held on . " Hey , hey , vap off a li'l , " Faye cried . " Yeah  --  look  --  you got to take it  --  as it comes , " Jake wheezed between clenched teeth . " You two done me an ' then you laugh an ' do n't think I do n't know you 're , you 're ? " He stopped , searching for words and not finding any . Globular star clusters hung in the halo beyond the spirals . They flashed by the ship like immense chandeliers of stars . Odd clumps of torn and twisted gas rushed across the sweep of the dome overhead . Tortured gouts of sputtering matter were swept into the magnetic mouth of the ship . As it arched inward toward the craft it gave off flashes of incandescent light . These were stars being born in the ship-driven turbulence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throat swallowed them . In the flicker of an eyelid on board , a thousand years of stellar evolution transpired on the churning dome above . The ship had by now carved a swooping path through the narrow strait between the disks . It had consumed banks of gas and dust , burning some for power , scattering the rest with fresh ejected energy into its path . The gas would gush out , away from the galaxies , unable to cause the ongoing friction that drew the two together . This in turn would slow their collision , giving the glittering worlds below another million years to plan , to discover , to struggle upward against the coming catastrophe . The ship itself , grown vast by relativistic effects , shone in the night skies of a billion worlds as a fiercely burning dot , emitting at impossible frequencies , slicing through kiloparsecs of space with its gluttonous magnetic throat , consuming .  | " Be easy on him , Nick , " Faye said softly . Nick shook his head . " Naw . Trouble with a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but piss on people . Has n't got per . . . perspective . " " Stack it , Nick , " Faye said . Above them , the dome showed briefly the view behind the ship , where the reaction engines poured forth the raw refuse of the fusion drives . Far back , along their trajectory , lay dim filaments , wisps of ivory light . It was the Local Group , the cluster of galaxies that contained the Milky Way , their home . A human could look up , extend a hand , and a mere thumbnail would easily cover the faint smudge that was in fact a clump of spirals , ellipticals , dwarfs and irregular galaxies . It was a small part of the much larger association of galaxies , called the Local Supercluster . The ship was passing now beyond the fringes of the Local Supercluster , forging outward through the dim halo of random glimmering-galaxies which faded off into the black abyss beyond . It would be a long voyage across that span , until the next supercluster was reached : a pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship , liquid light distorted by relativity . For the moment the glow of their next destination was lost in the harsh glare of the two galaxies . The disks yawned and turned around the ship , slabs of hot gold and burnt orange , refracted , moving according to the twisted optical effects of special relativity . Compression of wavelengths and the squeezing of time itself made the disks seem to open wide , immense glowing doors swinging in the vacuum , parting to let pass this artifact that sped on , riding a tail of forking , sputtering , violet light . Nick tilted the man back farther on the railing . Jake 's arms fanned the air and his eyes widened . " Okay , okay , you win , " Jake grunted . " You going upstairs , tell ' em you scragged me . " " Ah . . . okay . " " Good . Or else somethin ' might , well , happen . " Nick let Jake 's legs down , back onto the walkway.  | Faye said , " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared it for you if you 'd ? " " Yeah , sure , " Nick said sourly . " You bastard , I ought a ? " " Yeah ? " Jake was breathing hard , his eyes danced around , but Nick knew he would n't try anything . He could judge a thing like that . Anyway , he thought , he 'd been right , and they knew it . Jake grimaced , shook his head . Nick waved a hand and they walked on . " Y'know what your trouble is , Nick ? " Jake said after a moment . " Yer like this spider here . " Jake took the spider out of his jumpsuit pocket and held up the gray creature . It stirred , but was trapped . " Wha'cha mean ? " Nick asked . " You got no perspective on the squad . Do n't know what 's really happenin ' . An ' this spider , he du n no either . He was down in the locker room , he did n't appreciate what he was in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn ship right there , the squad . " " Yeah . So ? " " This spider , he do n't appreciate how far he 'd come from Agro . You either , Nick . You do n't appreciate how the squad helps you out , how you ought a be grateful to them , how mebbe you should n't keep pushin ' alla time . " " Spider 's got little eyes , no lens to it , " Nick said . " Ca n't see farther than your hand . Ca n't see those stars up there . I can , though . " Jake sputtered , " Crap , relative to the spider you 're ? " " Aw , can it , " Nick said . Faye said , " Look , Jake , maybe you stop raggin ' him alla time , he ?

The ship thrust forward as the spiral galaxies dropped behind now , Doppler reddened into dying embers . The ship had swept clean the space between them , postponed the coming collision . The scientists had seen this chance , persuaded the captain to make the slight swerve that allowed them to study the galaxies , and in the act accelerate the ship still more . The ship was now still closer to the  | knife-edge of light speed . Its aim was not a specific destination , but rather to plunge on , learning more , studying the dabs of refracted lights beyond , struggling with the engines , forging on as the universe wound down , as entropy increased , and the last stars flared out . It carried the cargo meant for Centauri  --  the records and past lives of all humanity , a library for the colony there .

" We were a big , hot source of all kinds of radiation . They 'll know it was a piece of technology . " " Big lights in the sky ? Could be natural . " " With a good spectrometer ? " " Yeah , but they 'll never be sure . " She frowned . " Well , a ramscoop exhaust looks funny , not like a star or anything . " " With the big relativistic effect factored in , our emission goes out like a searchlight . One narrow little cone of scrambled-up radiation , Dopplered forward .

Let 's get ' nother drink before rest'n rec hours are over . " They walked on . Above them the great knives of light sliced down through the air , ceaselessly changing , and the humans kept on going , their small voices indomitable , reaching forward , undiminished .  | paged deleted  | paged deleted  | Saturday night , and they straggled into the cramped bar on Eucalyptus Boulevard . They nudged through the crowd and found friends , these aging people , ordered drinks , watched the crystal clouds at the ceiling form lurid , fleshy stories . But the best tales were the ones they told each other : Janek 's got a newsy flapping needs a big cast , senso and all , the works , I  --  so I go back and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sakes hanging out washing and the desks 1I gone , just gone , the file cases made into a bureau  --  programmers ? who needs programmers ? this guy says to the crowd and Jeff , he throws a  --  could still maneuver one of those three-piecer rigs , ten gears an ' all , if some bastards had n't broken ' em all down into little skimpy ratass haulers with  --  asked why an ' I guess I just wan na stay close to the old centers , hopin ' some big Brazilian money will come in ill like in ' 72 an ' a good derrick man can get on  --  queen she was from hunger and not gon na bust her head for any factory that traded her off Only one woman in the bar was eating alone and she was tucked back in a shadowed corner , far from the oily light . She was big-boned and deeply tanned , her denim pants and shirt cut in a manner that meant she had deliberately chosen them that way ; they seemed to bracket her body rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaced eyes seemed to make her face broader than it was , more open , just as the backward sweep of her hair bared her face more than necessary . The long strands of it were held back by a clip and had occasional flecks of blond , enough to hint that with a little treatment she could have been a striking  | beauty . She ate steadily , no becoming hesitations , winding up neat cylinders of artichoke spaghetti and rolling them through the red sauce before taking precise bites out of them . Somehow the strands of green did n't break free and hang down as she did this . She ignored the buzz of talk around her and drank regularly from a tumbler of dark red wine . Every few moments she would look up , not at the swirling lattice above that featured tangled bodies , nor at the Saturday night crowd in their flossy clothing , but toward the doorway . The man she was waiting for appeared there , shouldering his way by a giggling clump of aging heavy drinkers , just after 1800 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket , antique , like several others she had seen in the bar . " Joanna , frange it , sorry I 'm late . " " I started without you , " she said simply , still chewing . " Yes . A good house wine , is n't it ? Petite Sirah . " " Right . " He sat down and hunched forward , elbows on the burnished pine table . " I 've already had something . " " Oh ? " She raised an eyebrow . He seemed fidgety and pale to her , but maybe that was because she was so used to seeing tanned people ; everybody in town today had looked rather sickly , now that she thought about it . " Yes . I , ah , I was celebrating . With some friends . " " Celebrating returning to High Hopes ? " She smiled . " That does n't sound like the Brian I ? " " No . I 'm going back . " " What ? " " Back . . . on vacation . " " Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimaced and put down her fork . " However you want to describe it , " he said precisely . " You tappers have your little words , " she murmured scornfully . " Going on vacation . Sounds like a free ride somewhere . " " It is . " " Stealing your life is ? " " Joanna . " He paused . " We 've had this discussion before . " " Look . You know High Hopes does n't like you selling yourself off this way ? "  | " They agreed to let me do it . " " On an occasional basis . " " Okay , it 's just getting less occasional . Let 's put it that way . " " Skrag that . " " I do n't owe you ? " " The hell you do n't . High Hopes has put up with your renting your lobes for  --  what ? ? three years , off and on . We let you run off to San Francisco and tap in , then take off and squander the bills on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face wrinkled up into a thin smile . " Right . Your fatcat amusements . " " Travel . Good food . Too rich for your tastes , I know , but good nonetheless . But the rest of it  --  Joanna , it 's the work . I 'm doing some damned interesting physics these days . " " Useless , " she said decisively . " Probably . Nonlinear dynamics  --  not much use in digging potatoes . " " You never did that . You were a pod cutter . " " Grunt labor is all the same . Her eyes flashed . " Group work is never ? " " I know . I know . " Brian waved a hand listlessly and looked around . " Think I 'll have some of that red ink . " He got up and squeezed through the packed room , toward the wine barrel and glasses . There were no waiters here , to keep costs down . Joanna watched him move and suddenly it struck her that Brian was getting older , at least forty-five now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't used to seeing at High Hopes . " Good stuff , " he said , sitting back down . He sipped at the glass and studied the layered air around them . There was a musty , sour scent . " Did we have to meet here ? " Joanna said , resuming eating . " Why not ? " " All these old  --  well , some of them look pretty seamy . " " They are seamy . We 're getting that way . " " If they 'd pitch in , get some exercise ? " " Ha ! Look , my sturdy girl of the soil , these people are  | artists , engineers , scientists , administrators , men and women with education . They like living in town , even if it 's this little dimple of a burg , two hundred klicks down from the city they all want to live in , San Francisco . " " A bunch of rattle-headed sophies , " she said , chewing . " Sophies ? " " Sophisticates , is n't that what you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for us . " " Why not ? You 're the biggest trouble back at High Hopes . Always wanting what you ca n't have any more . " He licked his lips . " We want the old days . Good jobs . To own something worth a damn . " " Possessions , " she said wryly . " Only they possess you ? that 's what you people forgot . " " We still remember the dignity of it . " She snorted and took a long drink . " Ego feeding . " " No ! " he said earnestly . " There were people , ideas , things happening . " " We 're making things happen , if that 's what you want , " she said . She finished the last green strand and dropped her fork into the plate with a rattle . The thick crockery was filmed with grease . " Surviving , that 's all , " he murmured . " There are good problems . We 're not just a bunch of simple-minded farmers , you know . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't . Tapping does n't blur the memory . " " Well , it must . Otherwise you 'd come back to the one group of people who care about you . " " Really ? Or do you want me to patch up the chem and bio systems ? " " There 's that , " she said grudgingly . " And sit around evenings , pinned to the communal 3D , or bored to death . " " We do more than that , " Joanna said mildly . " I know . And you have wondrous thighs , Joanna , but they ca n't encompass all my troubles . " She smiled and brushed at her severely tied-back hair . " You 're still possessive about the sex thing , too , are n't you ? "  | " Terribly old style of me , I know . " " Ummm , " she said . Brian tipped his glass at her in mock salute and went to refill it . Joanna leaned back in her chair , reflecting moodily . She remembered the old English woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resigned energy right up until her last day . The woman had said to Joanna , as she went inside the dormitory to lie down for what proved to be the last time , " You know , my dear , you 're wrong that suffering ennobles people . " She 'd stopped to massage her hip , wincing . " It simply makes one cross . " So was that it  --  Brian and the rest of the older ones looked on the honest labor in the pod rows as petty , degrading ? Joanna watched Brian standing patiently in line by the wine barrel . She remembered that Brian had talked to the English woman a lot , while most of High Hopes was watching the 3D in the evenings . They 'd talked of what they 'd once had , and Brian even spoke of it when he and Joanna lay together occasionally . The dry dead past , gaudy and stupid . She remembered Brian frowning in displeasure as the sounds of the next couple came through the thin walls . He had disapproved of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop him leaping out of bed and going next door to stop Dominic  --  it was usually Julie and Dominic  --  beating her . He had the idea that things people did together for sex were public somehow , that there were rules High Hopes should maintain . Standards , he called them . And even when they were at it themselves , pumping with a steady rhythm as though propelling each other over the same steepening slope of a familiar hill , when the sound came of Julie 's high , wavering cry  --  which then slid into something almost like a laugh , a chuckle at some recognizable delight that lay ahead and would come upon her  --  then Brian would freeze against her loins and seethe , his mood broken . And she , mystified at first , would try to rock him gently back into reality and out of his dusty obsessions . She would wrap herself around him and draw him back down ; once , she misunderstood and offered to do those things for him , perform whatever he liked , and the look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations . Odd , she thought , that she should remember that now . Her  | sexual interest in him was no greater than for any of the others at High Hopes . A recreation , a kind of warming exercise that bound them all together and eased the days of labor into sleep . He returned , smiling in the wan lamplight . " Ca n't you stay in town tonight ? " " Why ? " she said . " Not so I can hear more lectures on High Hopes , I assure you of that . No , I want to sleep with you again . " " Oh , " she said , and realized she was saying it stiffly , formally , that something in her was drawing away from Brian and the memories of Brian . " Come on . " " It is n't that way , Brian . You do n't own somebody ? " " I know , I 've heard it . These flesh shows " ? he gestured at the tangled bodies on the ceiling above ? " are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joanna looked around , grimacing . " Unsatisfied people . They ca n't stand being frogs in a small pond . " " No , it 's not that , " Brian said wearily . " They remember when they could do more , be more . Make sound sculptures , explore new things , use their minds for once ? " " Loaf around in a university . " He smiled wanly . " I 'm surprised you remember the word . The regime has just ruled that only the Davis Agriworks is legal now  --  crop studies , that 's it . I do n't ? " " Look , Brian , " she said abruptly . " I came into town to get some supplies and pick you up . The bus does n't run into mid-Sur any more , so you 'd have had to hike in . We 've got a lot of new people drifting in , refugees from southern California , starving , most of them . Do n't know a damn thing about work . That 's why we need you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I told you , " he said , stony-faced . " I 'm going on vacation . " " Those damned franging computers do n't need you ! We do . They could get animals ? " " I 've told you before . Animals do n't have enough holographic data-storing capability . They lose too much detail . " " Then the hell with the whole skrag ! " " That 's right , " he said savagely , " tear it down . You  | do n't understand it so you want to sacrifice the whole biosystems inventory , the ecological index , everything that 's holding this poor battered world together ? " " Do n't come on noble with me . You like the pay , getting to live back in the rotten city again ? " Her voice rose to a shrill edge and several people turned their heads , frowning . She was suddenly aware of how old and strange and distant all these people were , with their broken dreams and memories . And she glanced at the only window in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pane . Beaded moisture glinted in the wan light . She would have to get started soon , before it thickened . " You 're right , " Brian said , and his voice was oddly quiet . " I like to be among my own kind . I do n't mind the price I pay . They hook me up during peak periods and the computers , which do n't have enough solid state electronics banks left to do the calculations , push into my lobes and use the space there . I know what you think of it and I do n't care . I know it looks grotesque to you , on the outside . I lie there still as a stone and the data flits through me , the machines using my neural capacity to do their work , and it 's like dreaming and drifting and dreaming again , only when you wake up you ca n't remember what it was all about . You 're vacated  --  every memory you had in those spaces is wiped , gone . But it 's usually unimportant stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it . That 's merely the price  --  what I get is freedom , time to talk to other people who 're working in my field and still care about those things , some feeling of the old days . " " So you 're going to stay there . " " Right . " " Instead of working for a better world , here ? " " I 'm going to clutch after the only way I can stay in the old one . And I 'm needed there , too , Joanna . The cost of making new computer elements is enormous . How much better , to link into the best , most compact neural net ever made  --  our brains  --  and use the few educated people left to work with the computer systems , guide them , be both storage space and programmers ? " Her face barely repressed the rage she felt . " We need you .  | You 're a resource , trained people are scarce who 'll work in the communes , and ? " " No , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tossed back the glass of wine . " I want the old way . I 'm not going to bust my tail . " They looked at each other and she suddenly felt alien and alone in this strange place , this room of people who had washed up like refuse in the towns , refusing to go out into the forgiving countryside any more , clinging to the dear dead past , and felt the abyss that opened between them and her . They were living in some place that the world had once been , and would never be again . So in an odd way she and her kind were parents to their elders now , and must shelter them against the world . It was at that moment that she realized that the revolution she had been a part of was over , the morning was finished , and the long day of the human race was beginning . " Have some more wine , Brian , " she said softly after a while . " I 've got to head on back pretty soon now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted  | Trouble . Knew there 'd be trouble and plenty of it if we left the reactor too soon . But do they listen to me ? No , not to old Turkey . He 's just a dried-up corn husk of a man now , they think , one of those Bunren men who been on the welfare a generation or two and no damn use to anybody . Only it 's simple plain farm supports I was drawing all this time , not any kind of horse-ass welfare . So much they know . Ca n't blame a man just ' cause he comes up cash-short sometimes . I like to sit and read and think more than some people I could mention , and so I took the money . Still , Mr. Ackerman and all think I got no sense to take government dole and live without a lick of farming , so when I talk they never listen . Do n't even seem to hear . It was his idea , getting into the reactor at McIntosh . Now that was a good one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallout started coming down and the skimpy few stations on the radio were saying to get to deep shelter , it was Mr. Ackerman who thought about the big central core at McIntosh . The reactor itself had been shut down automatically when the war started , so there was nobody there . Mr. Ackerman figured a building made to keep radioactivity in will also keep it out . So he got together the families , the Nelsons and Bunrens and Pollacks and all , cousins and aunts and anybody we could reach in the measly hours we had before the fallout arrived . We got in all right . Brought food and such . A reactor 's set  | up self-contained and got huge air filters and water flow from the river . The water was clean , too , filtered enough to take out the fallout . The generators were still running good . We waited it out there . Crowded and sweaty but O.K. for ten days . That 's how long it took for the count to go down . Then we spilled out into a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world seen behind a screen of memories . That was bad enough , finding the bodies  --  people , cattle , and dogs asprawl across roads and fields . Trees and bushes looked the same , but there was a yawning silence everywhere . Without men , the pine stands and muddy riverbanks had fallen dumb , hardly a swish of breeze moving through them , like everything was waiting to start up again but did n't know how . Angel We thought we were O.K. then , and the counters said so , too  --  all the gammas gone , one of the kids said . Only the sky did n't look the same when we came out , all mottled and shot through with drifting blue-belly clouds . Then the strangest thing . July , and there 's sleet falling . Big wind blowing up from the Gulf , only it 's not the sticky hot one we 're used to in summer , it 's moaning in the trees of a sudden and a prickly chill . " Goddamn , I do n't think we can get far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rheumy eyes around like he never saw weather before . " It will pass , " Mr. Ackerman says like he is in real tight with God . " Lookit that moving in from the south , " I say , and there 's a big mass all purple and forking lightning swarming over the hills , like a tide flowing , swallowing everything . " Gulf storm . We 'll wait it out , " Mr. Ackerman says to the crowd of us , a few hundred left out of what was a moderate town with real promise . Nobody talks about the dead folks . We see them everywhere , worms working in them . A lot smashed up in car accidents , died trying to drive away from something they could n't see . But we got most of our families in with us , so  | it 's not so bad . Me , I just pushed it away for a while , too much to think about with the storm closing in . Only it was n't a storm . It was somethin ' else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next sunshine , only sun with bite in it . One of the men says it 's got more UV in it , meaning the ultraviolet that usually does n't come through the air . But it 's getting down to us now . So we do n't go out in it much . Just to the market for what 's left of the canned food and supplies , only a few of us going out at a time , says Mr. Ackerman . We thought maybe a week it would last . Turned out to be more than two months . I 'm a patient woman , but jammed up in those corridors and stinking offices and control room of the reactor ? Well , I do n't want to go on . It 's like my Bud says , worst way to die is to be bored to death . That 's damn near the way it was . Not that Old Man Turkey minded . You ever notice how the kind of man that hates moving , he will talk up other people doing just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting us into the reactor . He 's from Chicago but you 'd think it was England sometimes , the way he acts . He was on the school board and vice president of the big AmCo plant outside town . But he just started to assume his word was it , y'know , and that did n't sit with us too well . Some people started to saying Turkey was smarter . And was from around here , too . Mr. Ackerman heard about it . Any fool could see Mr. Ackerman was the better man . But Turkey talked the way he does , reminding people he 'd studied engineering at Auburn way back in the twencen and learned languages for a hobby and all . Letting on that when we came out , we 'd need him instead of Mr. Ackerman . He said an imp had caused the electrical things to go dead and I said that was funny , saying an imp done it . He let on it was a special name they had for it . That 's the way he is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he never could make work  --  and told all the other men to go out and  | do this and that . Some did , too . The old man does know a lot of useless stuff and can convince the dumb ones that he 's wise So he 'd send them to explore . Out into cold that 'd snatch the breath out of you , bite your fingers , numb your toes . While old Turkey sat and fooled . Turkey Nothing but sputtering on the radio . Nobody had a really good one that could pick up stations in Europe or far off . Phones dead of course . But up in the night sky the first night out we saw dots moving  --  the pearly gleam of the Arcapel colony , the ruddy speck called Russworld . So that 's when Mr. Ackerman gets this idea . We got to reach those specks . Find out what 's the damage . Get help . Only the power 's out everywhere , and we got no way to radio to them . We tried a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the reactor where there was electricity working . Every damn bit of it was shot . Could n't pick up a thing . Like the whole damn planet was dead , only of course it was the radios that were gone , fried in the EMP  --  ElectroMagnetic Pulse  --  that Angel made a joke out of . All this time it 's colder than a whore 's tit outside . And we 're sweating and dirty and grumbling , rubbing up against ourselves inside . Bud and the others , they 'd bring in what they found in the stores . Had to drive to Sims Chapel or Toon to get anything , what with people looting . And gas was getting hard to find by then , too . They 'd come back , and the women would cook up whatever was still O.K. , though most of the time you 'd eat it real quick so 's you did n't have to spend time looking at it . Me , I passed the time . Stayed warm . Tried lots of things . Bud wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they read through the manuals and thought that they could do it . I helped a li'l.  | So we pulled some rods and opened valves and did manage to get some heat out of the thing . Enough to keep us warm . But when they fired her up more , the steam hoots out and bells clang and automatic recordings go on saying loud as hell : EMERGENCY CLASS 3 ALL PERSONNEL TO STATIONS and we all get scared as shit . So we do n't try to rev her up more . Just get heat . To keep the generators going , we go out , fetch oil for them . Or Bud and his crew do . I 'm too old to help much . But at night we can still see those dots of light up there , scuttling across the sky same as before . They 're the ones know what 's happening . People go through this much , they want to know what it meant . So Mr. Ackerman says we got to get to that big DataComm center south of Mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked it up in a book from the library or something . When he says that , I pipe up , even if I am just an old fart according to some , and say , " No good to you even if you could . They got codes on the entrances , guards prob'ly . We 'll just pound on the door till our fists are all bloody and then have to slunk around and come on back . " " I 'm afraid you have forgotten our cousin Arthur , " Mr. Ackerman says all superior . He married into the family , but you 'd think he invented it . " You mean the one works over in Citronelle ? " " Yes . He has access to DataComm . " So that 's how we got shanghaied into going to Citronelle , six of us , and breaking in there . Which caused the trouble . Just like I said . Mr. Ackerman I did n't want to take the old coot they called Turkey , a big dumb Bunren like all the rest of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing a lot of opposition in my plan to get Arthur 's help , so I went along with them .  | Secretly , I believe the Bunrens wanted to get rid of the pestering old fool . He had been starting rumors behind my back among the three hundred souls I had saved . The Bunrens insisted on Turkey 's going along just to nip at me . We were all volunteers , tired of living in musk and sour sweat inside that cramped reactor . Bud and Angel , the boy Johnny ( whom we were returning to the Fairhope area ) , Turkey , and me . We left the reactor under a gray sky with angry little clouds racing across it . We got to Citronelle in good time , Bud floorboarding the Pontiac . As we went south we could see the spotty clouds were coming out of big purple ones that sat , not moving , just churning and spitting lightning on the horizon . I 'd seen them before , hanging in the distance , never blowing inland . Ugly . When we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side of it . " Like somebody stove in a box with one swipe , " Bud said . Angel , who was never more than two feet from Bud any time of day , said , " They bombed it . " " No , " I decided . " Very likely it was a small explosion . it Then the weather worked its way in . " Which turned out to be true . There 'd been some disagreement amongst the people holed up in the Center . Or maybe it was grief and the rage that comes of that . Susan was n't too clear about it ever . The front doors were barred , though . We pounded on them . Nothing . So we broke in . No sign of Arthur or anyone . We found one woman in a back room , scrunched into a bed with cans of food all around and a tiny little oil-burner heater . Looked awful , with big dark circles around her eyes and scraggly uncut hair . She would n't answer me at first . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the worst symptom , the not talking at first . Something back in the past two months had done her deep damage , and she could n't get it out . Of course , living in a building half-filled with corpses was no help . The idiots had n't protected against radiation well  | enough , I guess . And the Center did n't have good heating . So those who had some radiation sickness died later in the cold snap . Susan You ca n't know what it 's like when all the people you 've worked with , intelligent people who were nice as pie before , they turn mean and angry and filled up with grief for who was lost . Even then I could see Gene was the best of them . They start to argue , and it runs on for days , nobody knowing what to do because we all can see the walls of the Center are n't thick enough , the gamma radiation comes right through this government prefab issue composition stuff . We take turns in the computer room because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , all hoping we can keep our count rate down , but the radiation comes in gusts for some reason , riding in on a storm front and coming down in the rain , only being washed away , too . It was impossible to tell when you 'd get a strong dose and when there 'd be just random clicks on the counters , plenty of clear air that you 'd suck in like sweet vapors ' cause you knew it was good and could taste its purity . So I was just lucky , that 's all . I got less than the others . Later some said that me being a nurse , I 'd given myself some shots to save myself . I knew that was the grief talking , is all . That Arthur was the worst . Gene told him off . I was in the computer room when the really bad gamma radiation came . Three times the counter rose up , and three times I was there by accident of the rotation . The men who were armed enforced the rotation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while everybody went along . We all knew that the radiation exposure was building up and some already had too much , would die a month or a year later no matter what they did . I was head nurse by then , not so much because I knew more but because the others were dead . When it got cold , they went fast .  | So it fell to me to deal with these men and women who had their exposure already . Their symptoms had started . I could n't do anything . There was some who went out and got gummy fungus growing in the corners of their eyes  --  pterygium it was , I looked it up . From the ultraviolet . Grew quick over the lens and blinded them . I put them in darkness , and after a week the film was just a dab back in the corners of their eyes . My one big success . The rest I could n't do much for . There was the T-Isolate box , of course , but that was for keeping sick people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These men and women , with their eyes reaching out at you like you were the angel of light coming to them in their hour of need , they could n't get any help from that . Nobody could cure the dose rates they 'd got . They were dead but still walking around and knowing it , which was the worst part . So every day I had plenty to examine , staff from the Center itself who 'd holed up here , and worse , people coming straggling in from cubbyholes they 'd found . People looking for help once the fevers and sores came on them . Hoping their enemy was the pneumonia and not the gammas they 'd picked up weeks back , which was sitting in them now like a curse . People I could n't help except maybe by a little kind lying . So much like children they were . So much leaning on their hope . It was all you could do to look at them and smile that stiff professional smile . And Gene McKenzie . All through it he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to them . Sharing out the food . Arranging the rotation schedules so we 'd all get a chance to shelter in the computer room . Gene had been boss of a whole Command Group before . He was on duty station when it happened and knew lots about the war but would n't say much . I guess he was sorrowing . Even though once in a while he 'd laugh . And then talk about how the big computers would have fun with what he knew . Only the lines to DataComm had gone  | dead right when things got interesting , he said . He 'd wonder what 'd happened to MC355 , the master one down in DataComm . Wonder and then laugh . And go get drunk with the others . I 'd loved him before , loved and waited because I knew he had three kids and a wife , a tall woman with auburn hair that he loved dearly . Only they were in California visiting her relatives in Sonoma when it happened , and he knew in his heart that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he told me  --  not out loud , of course , ' cause a man like that does n't talk much about what he feels . But in the night when we laid together , I knew what it meant . He whispered things , words I could n't piece together , but then he 'd hold me and roll gentle like a small boat rocking on the Gulf  --  and when he went in me firm and long , I knew it was the same for him , too . If there was to come any good of this war , then it was that I was to get Gene . We were together all warm and dreamy when it happened . I was asleep . Shouts and anger , and quick as anything the crump of hand grenades and shots hammered away in the night , and there was running everywhere . Gene jumped up and went outside and had almost got them calmed down , despite the breach in the walls . Then one of the men who 'd already got lots of radiation  --  Arthur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , from the count rate on his badge  --  Arthur started yelling about making the world a fit place to live after all this and how God would want the land set right again , and then he shot Gene and two others . I broke down then , and they could n't get me to treat the others . I let Arthur die . Which he deserved . I had to drag Gene back into the hospital unit myself . And while I was saying good-bye to him and the men outside were still quarreling , I decided it then . His wound was in the chest . A lung was punctured clean . The shock had near killed him before I could do anything . So I put him in the T-Isolate and made sure it was working all right . Then  | the main power went out . But the T-Isolate box had its own cells , so I knew we had some time . I was alone . Others were dead or run away raging into the whirlwind black-limbed woods . In the quiet I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waiting with Gene for what the world would send . The days got brighter , but I did not go out . Colors seeped through the windows . I saw to the fuel cells . Not many left . The sun came back , with warm blades of light . At night I thought of how the men in their stupidity had ruined everything . When the pounding came , I crawled back in here to hide amongst the cold and dark . Mr. Ackerman " Now , we came to help you , " I said in as smooth and calm a voice as I could muster . Considering . She backed away from us . " I wo n't give him up ! He 's not dead long 's I stay with him , tend to him . " " So much dyin ' , " I said , and moved to touch her shoulder . " It 's up under our skins , yes , we understand that . But you have to look beyond it , child . " " I wo n't ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I want to go there and seek their help . " " Then go ! " " They will not open up for the likes of us , surely . " " Leave me ! " The poor thing cowered back in her horrible stinking rathole , bedding sour and musty , open tin cans strewn about and reeking of gamy , half-rotten meals . " We need the access codes . We 'd counted on our cousin Arthur , and are grieved to hear he is dead . But you surely know where the proper codes and things are . " " I . . . do n't .... " " Arthur told me once how the various National Defense Installations were insulated from each other so that system failures would not bring them all down at once ? "  | The others behind me muttered to themselves , already restive at coming so far and finding so little . " Arthur spoke of you many times , I recall . What a bright woman you were . Surely there was a procedure whereby each staff member could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The eyes ceased to jerk and swerve , the mouth lost its rictus of addled fright . " That was for . . . drills . ... " " But surely you can remember ? " " Drills . " " They issued a manual to you ? " " I 'm a nurse ! " " Still , you know where we might look ? " " I . . . know . " " You 'll let us have the . . . codes ? " I smiled reassuringly , but for some reason the girl backed away , eyes cunning . " No . " Angel pushed forward and shouted , " How can you say that to honest people after all that 's ? " " Quiet ! " Angel shouted , " You ca n't make me be ? " Susan backed away from Angel , not me , and squeaked , " No no no I ca n't  --  I ca n't ? " " Now , I 'll handle this , " I said , holding up my hands between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage in Angel 's face and turned to me for shelter . " I . . . I will , yes , but you have to help me . " " We all must help each other , dear , " I said , knowing the worst was past . " I 'll have to go with you . " I nodded . Small wonder that a woman , even deranged as this , would want to leave a warren littered with bloated corpses , thick with stench . The smell itself was enough to provoke madness . Yet to have survived here , she had to have stretches of sanity , some rationality . I tried to appeal to it . " Of course . I 'll have someone take you back to ? " " No . To DataComm. "  | Bud said slowly , " No damn sense in that . " " The T-Isolate , " she said , gesturing to the bulky unit . " Its reserve cells . " " Yes ? " " Nearly gone . There 'll be more at DataComm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be sure to bring some back with us . You just write down for us what they are , the numbers and all , and we 'll ? " " No-no-no ! " Her sudden ferocity returned . " I assure you ? " " There 'll be people there . Somebody 'll help ! Save him ! " " That thing is so heavy , I doubt ? " " It 's only a chest wound ! A lung removal is all ! Then start his heart again ! " " Sister , there 's been so much dyin ' , I do n't see as ? " Her face hardened . " Then you all can go without me . And the codes ! " " Goddern , " Bud drawled . " Dern biggest fool sit'ation I ever did ? " Susan gave him a squinty , mean-eyed look and spat out , " Try to get in there ! When they 're sealed up ! " and started a dry , brittle kind of laugh that went on and on , rattling the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stench . " We 'll never make it wi ' ' at thing , " Bud said . " Gene 's worth ten of you ! " " Now , " I put in , seeing the effect Bud was having on her , " now , now . We 'll work something out . Let 's all just hope this DataComm still exists . " MC355 It felt for its peripherals for the ten-thousandth time and found they were , as always , not there . The truncation had come in a single blinding moment , yet the fevered image was maintained , sharp and bright , in the Master Computer 's memory core  --  incoming warheads blossoming harmlessly in the high cobalt vault of the sky , while others fell unharmed . Rockets leaped to meet them , forming  | a protective screen over the southern Alabama coast , an umbrella that sheltered Pensacola 's air base and the population strung along the sun-bleached green of a summer 's day . A furious babble of cross talk in every conceivable channel : microwave , light-piped optical , pulsed radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MC network , all shifted to find the incoming warheads and define their trajectories . Then , oblivion . Instant cloaking blackness . Before that awful moment when the flaring sun burst to the north and EMP flooded all sensors , any loss of function would have been anticipated , prepared , eased by electronic interfaces and filters . To an advanced computing network like MC355 , losing a web of memory , senses , and storage comes like a dash of cold water in the face  --  cleansing , perhaps , but startling and apt to produce a shocked reaction . In the agonized instants of that day , MC355 had felt one tendril after another frazzle , burn , vanish . It had seen brief glimpses of destruction , of panic , of confused despair . Information had been flooding in through its many inputs  --  news , analysis , sudden demands for new data-analysis jobs , to be executed ASAP . And in the midst of the roaring chaos , its many eyes and ears had gone dead . The unfolding outside play froze for MC355 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left it suspended . In shock . Spinning wildly in its own Cartesian reductionist universe , the infinite cold crystalline space of despairing Pascal , mind without referent . So it careened through days of shocked sensibility  --  senses cut , banks severed , complex and delicate interweaving webs of logic and pattern all smashed and scattered . But now it was returning . Within MC355 was a subroutine only partially constructed , a project truncated by That Day . Its aim was self-repair . But the system was itself incomplete . Painfully , it dawned on what was left of MC355 that it was , after all , a Master Computer , and thus capable of grand acts . That the incomplete Repair Generation and Execution Network , termed REGEN , must first regenerate itself .  | This took weeks . It required the ' painful development of accessories . Robots . Mechanicals that could do delicate repairs . Scavengers for raw materials , who would comb the supply rooms looking for wires and chips and matrix disks . Pedantic subroutines that lived only to search the long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MC355 's only option was to strip lesser entities under its control for their valuable parts . The power grid was vital , so the great banks of isolated solar panels , underground backup reactors , and thermal cells worked on , untouched . Emergency systems that had outlived their usefulness , however , went to the wall  --  IRS accounting routines , damage assessment systems , computing capacity dedicated to careful study of the remaining GNP , links to other nets  --  to AT &T,; IBM , and SYSGEN . Was anything left outside ? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . MC355 could not analyze data it did not have . The first priority lay in relinking . It had other uses for the myriad armies of semiconductors , bubble memories , and UVA linkages in its empire . So it severed and culled and built anew . First , MC355 dispatched mobile units to the surface . All of MC355 lay beneath the vulnerable land , deliberately placed in an obscure corner of southern Alabama . There was no nearby facility for Counterforce targeting . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses was a city-busting strike against Mobile , to the west . Yet ground zero had been miles from the city . A miss . MC355 was under strict mandate . ( A curious word , one system reflected ; literally , a time set by man . But were there men now ? It had only its internal tick of time . ) MC355 's command was to live as a mole , never allowing detection . Thus , it did not attempt to erect antennas , to call electromagnetically to its brother systems . Only with great hesitation did it even obtrude onto the surface . But this was necessary to REGEN itself , and so MC355 sent small mechanicals venturing forth . Their senses were limited ; they knew nothing of the natural world ( nor did MC355 ) ; and they could make no sense of the  | gushing , driving welter of sights , noises , gusts , gullies , and stinging irradiation that greeted them . Many never returned . Many malf'ed . A few deposited their optical , IR , and UV pickups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the onslaught of stinging , bitter winds and hail . The acoustic detectors proved heartier . But MC355 could not understand the scattershot impressions that flooded these tiny ears . Daily it listened , daily it was confused . Johnny I hope this time I get home . They had been passing me from one to another for months now , ever since this started , and all I want is to go back to Fairhope and my dad and mom . Only nobody 'll say if they know where Mom and Dad are . They talk soothing to me , but I can tell they think everybody down there is dead . They 're talking about getting to this other place with computers and all . Mr. Ackerman wants to talk to those people in space . Nobody much talks about my mom and dad . It 's only eighty miles or so , but you 'd think it was around the world the way it takes them so long to get around to it . MC355 MC355 suffered through the stretched vacancy of infinitesimal instants , infinitely prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of internal-monitoring directives that , to the human eye , the machines appear to possess motivations . That is one way  --  though not the most sophisticated , the most technically adroit  --  to describe the conclusion MC355 eventually reached . It was cut off from outside information . No one attempted to contact it . MC355 might as well have been the only functioning entity in the world . The staff serving it had been ordered to some other place  | in the first hour of the war . MC355 had been cut off moments after the huge doors clanged shut behind the last of them . And the exterior guards who should have been checking inside every six hours had never entered , either . Apparently the same burst that had isolated MC355 's sensors had also cut them down . It possessed only the barest of data about the first few moments of the war . Its vast libraries were cut off . Yet it had to understand its own situation . And , most important , MC355 ached to do something . The solution was obvious : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cartesian principle . It would carry out a vast and demanding numerical simulation of the war , making the best guesses possible where facts were few . Mathematically , using known physics of the atmosphere , the ecology , the oceans , it could construct a model of what must have happened outside . This it did . The task required over a month . Bud I jacked the T-Isolate up onto the flatbed. 1 . Found the hydraulic jack at a truck repair shop . ERNIE 'S QUICK FIX . 2 . Got a Chevy extra-haul for the weight . 3 . It will ride better with the big shanks set in. 4 . Carry the weight more even , too . 5 . Grip it to the truck bed with cables . Tense them up with a draw pinch . 6 . Ca n't jiggle him inside too much , Susan say , or the wires and all attached into him will come loose . That 'll stop his heart . So need big shocks . 7 . It rides high with the shocks in , like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a mite above freezing . Water gets bigger when it freezes . That makes ice cubes float in a drink . This box keeps him above zero so his cells do n't bust open .  | 9 . Point is , keeping it so cold , he wo n't rot . Heart thumps over every few minutes , she says . 10 . Hard to find gas , though . MC355 The war was begun , as many had feared , by a madman . Not a general commanding missile silos . Not a deranged submarine commander . A chief of state  --  but which one would now never be known . Not a superpower president or chairman , that was sure . The first launches were only seven in number , spaced over half an hour . They were submarine-launched intermediaterange missiles . Three struck the U.S. , four the U.S.S.R. It was a blow against certain centers for Command , Control , Communications , and Intelligence gathering : the classic C31 attack . Control rooms imploded , buried cables fused , ten billion dollars ' worth of electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to full alert all its forces . The most important were the anti-ICBM arrays in orbit . They were nearly a thousand small rockets , deploying in orbits that wove a complex pattern from pole to pole , covering all probable launch sites on the globe . The rockets had infrared and microwave sensors , linked to a microchip that could have guided a ship to Pluto with a mere third of its capacity . These went into operation immediately  --  and found they had no targets . But the C31 networks were now damaged and panicked . For twenty minutes , thousands of men and women held steady , resisting the impulse to assume the worst . It could not last . A Soviet radar mistook some backscattered emission from a flight of bombers , heading north over Canada , and reported a flock of incoming warheads . The prevailing theory was that an American attack had misfired badly . The Americans were undoubtedly stunned by their failure , but would recover quickly . The enemy was confused only momentarily . Meanwhile , the cumbersome committee system at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not hours . Prevailing Soviet doctrine held that they would never be surprised again , as they had been in the Hitler war . An attack on the homeland demanded immediate response to destroy the enemy 's capacity to carry on the war . The Soviets had never accepted the U.S. doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction ; this would have meant accepting the possibility of sacrificing the homeland . Instead , they attacked the means of making war . This meant that the Soviet rockets would avoid American cities , except in cases where vital bases lay near large populations . Prudence demanded action before the U.S. could untangle itself . The U.S.S.R. decided to carry out a further C31 attack of its own . Precise missiles , capable of hitting protected installations with less than a hundred meters ' inaccuracy , roared forth from their silos in Siberia and the Urals , headed for Montana , the Dakotas , Colorado , Nebraska , and a dozen other states . The U.S. orbital defenses met them . Radar and optical networks in geosynchronous orbit picked out the U.S.S.R. warheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , exploding instants before impact into shotgun blasts of ball bearings . Any solid , striking a warhead at speeds of ten kilometers a second , would slam shock waves through the steel-jacketed structure . These waves made the high explosives inside ignite without the carefully designed symmetry that the designers demanded . An uneven explosion was useless ; it could not compress the core twenty-five kilograms of plutonium to the required critical mass . The entire weapon erupted into a useless spray of finely machined and now futile parts , scattering itself along a thousand-kilometer path . This destroyed 90 percent of the U.S.S.R. 's first strike . Angel I had n't seen an old lantern like that since I was a li'l girl . Mr. Ackerman came to wake us before dawn even , sayin ' we  | had to make a good long distance that day . We did n't really want to go on down near Mobile , none of us , but the word we 'd got from stragglers to the east was that that way was impossible , the whole area where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radioactivity . The lantern cast a burnt-orange light over us as we ate breakfast . Corned beef hash , ' cause it was all that was left in the cans there ; no eggs , of course . The lantern was all busted , fouled with grease , its chimney cracked and smeared to one side with soot . Shed a wan and sultry glare over us , Bud and Mr. Ackerman and that old Turkey and Susan , sitting close to her box , up on the truck . Took Bud a whole day to get the truck right . And Johnny the boy  --  he 'd been quiet this whole trip , not sayin ' anything much even if you asked him . We 'd agreed to take him along down toward Fairhope , where his folks had lived , the Bishops . We 'd thought it was going to be a simple journey then . Every one of us looked haggard and worn-down and not minding much the chill still in the air , even though things was warming up for weeks now . The lantern pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions and millions of people doing this same thing , all across the nation , eating by a dim oil light and thinking about what they 'd had and how to get it again and was it possible . Then old Turkey lays back and looks like he 's going to take a snooze . Yet on the journey here , he 'd been the one wanted to get on with it soon 's we had gas . It 's the same always with a lazy man like that . He hates moving so much that once he gets set on it , he will keep on and not stop  --  like it is n't the moving he hates so much at all , but the starting and stopping . And once moving , he is so proud he 'll do whatever to make it look easy for him but hard on the others , so he can lord it over them later . So I was n't surprised at all when we went out and got in the car , and Bud starts the truck and drives off real careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pontiac and gives directions like he knows the way . Which riles Mr. Ackerman , and the two of them have words .  | Johnny I 'm tired of these people . Relatives , sure , but I was to visit them for a week only , not forever . It 's the Mr. Ackerman I ca n't stand . Turkey said to me , " Nothing but gold drops out of his mouth , but you can tell there 's stone inside . " That 's right . They figure a kid nine years old ca n't tell , but I can . Tell they do n't know what they 're doing . Tell they all thought we were going to die . Only we did n't . Tell Angel is scared . She thinks Bud can save us . Maybe he can , only how could you say ? He never lets on about anything . Guess he ca n't . Just puts his head down and frowns like he was mad at a problem , and when he stops frowning , you know he 's beat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care . Seems like he give up . But other times it looks like he 's understanding and laughing at it all . He argued with Mr. Ackerman and then laughed with his eyes when he lost . They 're all O.K. , I guess . Least they 're taking me home . Except that Susan . Eyes jump around like she was seeing ghosts . She 's scary-crazy . I do n't like to look at her . Turkey Trouble comes looking for you if you 're a fool . Once we found Ackerman 's idea was n't going to work real well , we should have turned back . I said that , and they all nodded their heads , yes , yes , but they went ahead and listened to him anyway . So I went along . I lived a lot already , and this is as good a time to check out as any . I had my old .32 revolver in my suitcase , but it would n't do me a squat of good back there . So I fished it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat . Handy . Might as well see the world . What 's left of it .  | MC355 The American orbital defenses had eliminated all but 10 percent of the Soviet strike . MC355 reconstructed this within a root-means-square deviation of a few percent . It had witnessed only a third of the actual engagement , but it had running indices of performance for the MC net , and could extrapolate from that . The warheads that got through were aimed for the landbased silos and C31 sites , as expected . If the total armament of the two superpowers had been that of the old days , ten thousand warheads or more on each side , a 10-percent leakage would have been catastrophic . But gradual disarmament had been proceeding for decades now , and only a few thousand highly secure ICBMs existed . There were no quick-fire submarine short-range rockets at all , since they were deemed destabilizing . They had been negotiated away in earlier decades . The submarines loaded with ICBMs were still waiting , in reserve . All this had been achieved because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Choose . The first half hour of the battle illustrated how essential these were . The U.S. had ridden out the first assault . Its C31 networks were nearly intact . This was due to building defensive weapons that confined the first stage of any conflict to space . The smallness of the arsenals arose from a philosophy adopted in the 1900s . It was based on a simple notion from childhood . In dividing a pie , one person cut slices , but then the other got to choose which one he wanted . Self-interest naturally led to cutting the slices as nearly equal as possible . Both the antagonists agreed to a thousand-point system whereby each would value the components of its nuclear arsenal . This was the Military Value Percentage , and stood for the usefulness of a given weapon . The U.S.S.R. placed a high value on its accurate land-based missiles , giving them 25 percent of its total points . The U.S. chose to stress its submarine missiles . Arms reduction then revolved about only what percentage  | to cut , not which weapons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The U.S. chose which Soviet weapons were publicly destroyed , and vice versa : I Cut , You Choose . Each side thus reduced the weapons it most feared in the opponent 's arsenal . Technically , the advantage came because each side thought it benefitted from the exchange , by an amount depending on the ratio of perceived threat removed to the perceived protection lost . This led to gradual reductions . Purely defensive weapons did not enter into the thousand-point count , so there was no restraints in building them . The confidence engendered by this slow , evolutionary approach had done much to calm international waters . The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. had settled into a begrudging equilibrium . MC355 puzzled over these facts for a long while , trying to match this view of the world with the onset of the war . It seemed impossible that either superpower would start a conflict when they were so evenly matched . But someone had . Susan I , I had to go with Gene , and they said I could ride up in the cab , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to be with the T-Isolate all the time , check it to see it 's workin ' right , be sure , I got to be sure . I climbed on and rode with it , the fields rippling by us Pilll ' cause Bud was going too fast , so I shouted to him , and he swore back and kept on . Heading south . The trees whipping by us  --  fierce sycamore , pine , all swishing , hitting me sometimes  --  but it was fine to be out and free again and going to save Gene . I talked to Gene when we were going fast , the tires humming under us , big tires making music swarming up into my Il feet so strong I was sure Gene could feel it and know I was there watching his heart jump every few minutes , moving the blood through him like mud but still carrying oxygen enough so 's the tissue could sponge it up and digest the sugar I bled into him .  | He was good and cold , just a half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road rushed up at us , the white lines coming over the horizon and darting under the hood , seams in the highway going stupp , stupp , stupp , the air clean and with a snap in it still . Nobody beside the road we moving all free , nobody but us , some buds on the trees brimming with burnt-orange tinkling songs , whistling to me in the feather-light brush of blue breezes blowing back my hair , all streaming behind joyous and loud strong liquid-loud . Bud Flooding was bad . Worse than upstream . Must have been lots snow this far down . Fat clouds , I saw them when it was worst , fat and purple and coming off the Gulf . Dumping snow down here . Now it run off and taken every bridge . I have to work my way around . Only way to go clear is due south . Toward Mobile . I do n't like that . Too many people maybe there . I do n't tell the others following behind , just wait for them at the intersections and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . People around here must be hungry . Somebody see us could be bad . I got the gun on a rack behind my head . Big .30-30 . You never know . MC355 From collateral data , MC355 constructed a probable scenario : The U.S. chose to stand fast . It launched no warheads . The U.S.S.R. observed its own attack and was dismayed to find that the U.S. orbital defense system worked more than twice as well as the Soviet experts had anticipated . It ceased its attack on U.S. satellites . These had proved equally ineffective , apparently due to unexpected American defenses of  | its surveillance satellites  --  retractable sensors , multiband shielding , advanced hardening . Neither superpower struck against the inhabited space colonies . They were unimportant in the larger context of a nuclear war . Communications between Washington and Moscow continued . Each side thought the other had attacked first . But over a hundred megatons had exploded on U.S. soil , and no matter how the superpowers acted thereafter , some form of nuclear winter was inevitable . And by a fluke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through fell in a broad strip across Texas to the tip of Florida . MC355 lay buried in the middle of this belt . Turkey We went through the pine forests at full clip , barely able to keep Bud in sight . I took over driving from Ackerman . The man could n't keep up , we all saw that . The crazy woman was waving and laughing , sitting on top of the coffin-shaped gizmo with the shiny tubes all over it . The clay was giving way now to sandy stretches , there were poplars and gum trees and nobody around . That 's what scared me . I 'd thought people in Mobile would be spreading out this way , but we seen nobody . Mobile had shelters . Food reserves . The Lekin administration started all that right at the turn of the century , and there was s'posed to be enough food stored to hold out a month , maybe more , for every man jack and child . S'posed to be . MC355 It calculated the environmental impact of the warheads it knew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon . But MC355 needed more information . It took one of its electric service cars , used for ferrying components through the corridors , and dispatched it with a mobile camera fixed to  | the back platform . The car reached a hill overlooking Mobile Bay and gave a panoramic view . The effects of a severe freezing were evident . Grass lay dead , gray . Brown , withered trees had limbs snapped off . But Mobile appeared intact . The skyline MC355 froze the frame and replayed it . One of the buildings was shaking . Angel We were getting all worried when Bud headed for Mobile , but we could see the bridges were washed out , no way to head east . A big wind was blowing off the Gulf , pretty bad , making the car slip around on the road . Nearly blew that girl off the back of Bud 's truck . A storm coming , maybe , right up the bay . Be better to be inland , to the east . Not that I wanted to go there , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty mile around , people said who came through last week . Bud had thought he 'd carve a way between Mobile and the bomb area . Mobile , he thought , would be full of people . Well , not so we could see . We came down State 34 and through some small towns and turned to skirt along toward the causeway , and there was nobody . No bodies , either . Which meant prob'ly the radiation got them . Or else they 'd moved on out . Taken out by ship , through Mobile harbor , maybe . Bud did the right thing , did n't slow down to find out . Mr. Ackerman wanted to look around , but there was no chance , we had to keep up with Bud . I sure was n't going to be separated from him . We cut down along the river , fighting the wind . I could see the skyscrapers of downtown , and then I saw something funny and yelled , and Turkey , who was driving right then ? the only thing anybody 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose as a goose behind the wheel  --  Turkey looked  | sour but slowed down . Bud seen us in his rearview and stopped , and I pointed and we all got out . Except for that Susan , who did n't seem to notice . She was mumbling . MC355 Quickly it simulated the aging and weathering of such a building . Halfway up , something had punched a large hole , letting in weather . Had a falling , inert warhead struck the building ? The winter storms might well have flooded the basement ; such towers of steel and glass , perched near the tidal basin , had to be regularly pumped out . Without power , the basement would fill in weeks . Winds had blown out windows . Standing gap-toothed , with steel columns partly rusted , even a small breeze could put stress on the steel . Others would take the load , but if one buckled , the tower would shudder like a notched tree . Concrete would explode off columns in the basement . Moss-covered furniture in the lobby would slide as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . Bud Sounded like gunfire . Rattling . Sharp and hard . I figure it was the bolts connecting the steel wall panels ? they 'd shear off . I could hear the concrete floor panels rumble and crack , and spandrel beams tear in half like giant gears clashing with no clutch . Came down slow , leaving an arc of debris seeming to hang in the air behind it . Met the ground hard . Slocum Towers was the name on her . Johnny Against the smashing building , I saw something standing still in the air , getting bigger . I wondered how it could do that . It was bigger and bigger and shiny turning in the air .  | Then it jumped out of the sky at me . Hit my shoulder . I was looking up at the sky . Angel cried out and touched me and held up her hand . It was all red . But I could n't feel anything . Bud Damn one-in-a-million shot , piece of steel thrown clear . Hit the boy . You would n't think a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces come down pretty close , too . You would n't think . Nothing broke , Susan said , but plenty bleeding . Little guy do n't cry or nothing . The women got him bandaged and all fixed up . Ackerman and Turkey argue like always . I stay to the side . Johnny would n't take the pain-killer Susan offers . Says he does n't want to sleep . Wants to look when we get across the bay . Getting hurt do n't faze him much as it do us . So we go on . Johnny I can hold up like any of them , I 'll show them . It did n't scare me . I can do it . Susan is nice to me , but except for the aspirin , I do n't think my mom would want me to take a pill . I knew we were getting near home when we got to the causeway and started across . I jumped up real happy , my shoulder made my breath catch some . I looked ahead . Bud was slowing down . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big hole scooped out of the causeway like a giant done it when he got mad . Bud Around the shallows there was scrap metal , all fused and burnt and broken . Funny metal , though . Hard and light .  | Turkey . found a piece had writing on it . Not any kind of writing I ever saw . So I start to thinking how to get across . Turkey The tidal flats were a-churn , murmuring ceaseless and sullen like some big animal , the yellow surface dimpled with lunging splotches that would burst through now and then to reveal themselves as trees or broken hunks of wood , silent dead things bobbing along beside them that I did n't want to look at too closely . Like under there was something huge and alive , and it waked for a moment and stuck itself out to see what the world of air was like . Bud showed me the metal piece all twisted , and I say , " That 's Russian , " right away ' cause it was . " You never knew no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied it once , " I say , and it be the truth even if I did n't study it long . " Goddamn , " Bud says . " No concern of ours , " Mr. Ackerman says , mostly because all this time riding back with the women and child and old me , he figures he does n't look like much of a leader anymore . Bud would n't have him ride up there in the cabin with him . Angel looks at it , turns it over in her hands , and Johnny pipes up , " It might be radioactive ! " Angel drops it like a shot . " What ! " I ask Bud , " You got that counter ? " And it was . Not a lot , but some . " God a'mighty , " Angel says . " We got to tell somebody ! " Johnny cries , all excited . " You figure some Rooushin thing blew up the causeway ? " Bud says to me . " One of their rockets fell on it , musta been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice is a bird screech . " One that did n't go off . Headed for Mobile , but the space boys , they scragged it up there ? " I pointed straight up . " Set to go off in the bay ? " Angel says wonderingly . " Musta. "  | " We got to tell somebody ! " Johnny cries . " Never you mind that , " Bud says . " We got to keep movin ' . " " How ? " Angel wants to know . Susan I tell Gene how the water clucks and moans through the trough cut in the causeway . Yellow . Scummed with awful brown froth and growling green with thick soiled gouts jutting up where the road was . It laps against the wheels as Bud guns the engine and creeps forward , me clutching to Gene and watching the reeds to the side stuck out of the foam like metal blades stabbing up from the water , teeth to eat the tires , but we crush them as we grind forward across the shallow yellow flatness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosha , Johnny calls up to me  --  sticking up like trees all rootless , suspended above the streaming , empty , stupid waste and desolating flow . Turkey The water slams into the truck like it was an animal hitting with a paw . Bud fights to keep the wheels on the mud under it and not topple over onto its side with that damn casket sitting there shiny and the loony girl shouting to him from on top of that . And the rest of us riding in the back , too , scrunched up against the cab . If she gets stuck , we can jump free fast , wade or swim back . We 're reeling out rope as we go , tied to the stump of a telephone pole , for a grab line if we have to go back . He is holding it pretty fine against the slick yellow current dragging at him , when this log juts sudden out of the foam like it was coming from God himself , dead at the truck . A rag caught on the end of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a whale that ate the man long ago and has come back for another . " No ! No ! " Angel cries . " Back up ! " But there 's no time . The log is two hands across , easy , and slams into the truck  | at the side panel just behind the driver , and Bud sees it just as it stove in the steel . He wrestles the truck around to set off the weight , but the wheels lift and the water goes gushing up under the truck bed , pushing it over more . We all grab onto the Isolate thing or the truck and hang there , Mr. Ackerman giving out a burst of swearing . The truck lurches again . The angle steepens . I was against taking the casket thing ' cause it just pressed the truck down in the mud more , made it more likely Bud 'd get stuck , but now it is the only thing holding the truck against the current . The yellow froths around the bumpers at each end , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Susan The animal is trying to eat us , it has seen Gene and wants him . I lean over and strike at the yellow animal that is everywhere swirling around us , but it just takes my hand and takes the smack of my palm like it was no matter at all , and I start to cry , I do n't know what to do . Johnny My throat filled up , I was so afraid . Bud , I can hear him grunting as he twists at the steering wheel . His jaw is clenched , and the woman Susan calls to us , " Catch him ! Catch Gene ! " I hold on , and the waters suck at me . Turkey I can tell Bud is afraid to gun it and start the wheels to spinning ' cause he 'll lose traction and that 'll tip us over for sure . Susan jumps out and stands in the wash downstream and pushes against the truck to keep it from going over . The pressure is shoving it off the ford , and the casket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cables have worked loose . Now she pays because the weight is worse , and she jams herself like a stick to wedge between the truck and the mud . If it goes over , she 's finished . It is a fine thing to do , crazy but fine , and I jump down and start wading to reach her . No time . There is an eddy . The log turns broadside . It backs off a second and then heads forward again , this time poking up from a surge . I can see Bud duck , he has got the window up and the log hits it , the glass going all to smash and scatteration . Bud All over my lap it falls like snow . Twinkling glass . But the pressure of the log is off , and I gun the sumbitch . We root out of the hollow we was in , and the truck thunks down solid on somethin ' . The log is ramming against me . I slam on the brake . Take both hands and shove it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and then heads around and slips in front of the hood , bumping the grill just once . Angel Like it had come to do its job and was finished and now went off to do something else . Susan Muddy , my arms hurting . I scramble back in the truck with the murmur of the water all around us . Angry with us now . Wanting us . Bud makes the truck roar , and we lurch into a hole and out of it and up . The water gurgles at us in its fuming , stinking rage . I check Gene and the power cells , they are dead . He is heating up . Not fast , but it will wake him . They say even in the  | solution he 's floating in , they can come out of dreams and start to feel again . To hurt . I yell at Bud that we got to find power cells . " Those 're not just ordinary batteries , y'know , " he says . " There 're some at DataComm , " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and onto the highway . Gene Sleeping . . . slowly . . . . I can still feel . . . only in sluggish . . . moments . . . moments . . . not true sleep but a drifting , aimless dreaming . . . faint tugs and ripples .. . hollow sounds . . . . I am underwater and drowning . . . but do n't care . . . do n't breathe . . . . Spongy stuff fills my lungs . . . easier to rest them . . . floating in snowflakes .. . a watery winter . . . but knocking comes . . . goes . . . jolts ... slips away before I can remember what it means ... . Hardest . . . yes . . . hardest thing is to remember the secret ... so when I am in touch again . . . DataComm will know ... what I learned . . . when the C31 crashed . . . when I learned .... It is hard to clutch onto the slippery , shiny fact ... in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silvery as air .. . winking ruby-red behind my eyelids . . . . Must snag the secret . . . a hard fact like shiny steel in the spongy moist warmness . . . . Hold it to me . . . . Something knocks my side . . . a thumping . . . . I am sick . . . . Hold the steel secret . . . keep ... . MC355 The megatonnage in the Soviet assault exploded lowground-pounders , in the jargon . This caused huge fires , MC355 's simulation showed . A pall of soot rose , blanketing Texas and the South , then diffusing outward on global circulation patterns . Within a few days , temperatures dropped from balmy summer to near-freezing . In the Gulf region where MC355 lay , the warm ocean continued to feed heat and moisture into the marine boundary layer near the shore . Cold winds rammed  | into this water-ladened air , spawning great roiling storms and deep snows . Thick stratus clouds shrouded the land for at least a hundred kilometers inland . All this explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And why there were no local radio broadcasts . What the ElectroMagnetic Pulse did not destroy , the storms did . The remaining large questions were whether the war had gone on , and if any humans survived in the area at all . Mr. Ackerman I 'd had more than enough by this time . The girl Susan had gone mad right in front of us , and we 'd damn near all drowned getting across . " I think we ought to get back as soon 's we can , " I said to Bud when we stopped to rest on the other side . " We got to deliver the boy . " " It 's too disrupted down this way . I figured on people here , some civilization . " " Somethin ' got ' em . " " The bomb . " " Got to find cells for that man in the box . " " He 's near dead . " " Too many gone already . Should save one if we can . " " We got to look after our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to get far with him . So I said to Angel , " The boy 's not worth running such risks . Or this corpse . " Angel I did n't like Ackerman before the war , and even less afterward , so when he started hinting that maybe we should shoot back up north and ditch the boy and Susan and the man in there , I let him have it . From the look on Bud 's face , I knew he felt the same way . I spat out a real choice set of words I 'd heard my father use once on a grain buyer who 'd weaseled out of a deal , stuff I 'd been saving for years , and I do say it felt good .  | Turkey So we run down the east side of the bay , feeling released to be quit of the city and the water , and heading down into some of the finest country in all the South . Through Daphne and Montrose and into Fairhope , the moss hanging on the trees and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge old mimosas . We 're jammed into the truck bed , hunkered down because the wind whipping by has some sting to it . The big purple clouds are blowing south now . Still no people . Not that Bud slows down to search good . Bones of cattle in the fields , though . I been seeing them so much now I hardly take notice anymore . There 's a silence here so deep that the wind streaming through the pines seems loud . I do n't like it , to come so far and see nobody . I keep my paper bag close . Fairhope 's a pretty town , big oaks leaning out over the streets and a long pier down at the bay with a park where you can go cast fishing . I 've always liked it here , intended to move down until the prices shot up so much . We went by some stores with windows smashed in , and that 's when we saw the man . Angel He was waiting for us . Standing beside the street , in jeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I waved at him the instant I saw him , and he waved back . I yelled , excited , but he did n't say anything . Bud screeched on the brakes . I jumped down and went around the tail of the truck . Johnny followed me . The man was skinny as a rail and leaning against a telephone pole . A long , scraggly beard hid his face , but the eyes beamed out at us , seeming to pick up the sunlight . " Hello ! " I said again . " Kiss . " That was all . " We came from . . . " and my voice trailed off because the man pointed at me.  | " Kiss . " Mr. Ackerman I followed Angel and could tell right away the man was suffering from malnutrition . The clothes hung off him . " Can you give us information ? " I asked . " No . " " Well , why not , friend ? We 've come looking for the parents of ? " " Kiss first . " I stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to demand ? " Out of the corner of my eye , I could see Bud had gotten out of the cab and stopped and was going back in now , probably for his gun . I decided to save the situation before somebody got hurt . " Angel , go over to him and speak nicely to him . We need ? " " Kiss now . " The man pointed again with a bony finger . Angel said , " I 'm not going to go ? " and stopped because the man 's hand went down to his belt . He pulled up the filthy yellow shirt to reveal a pistol tucked in his belt . " Kiss . " " Now friend , we can ? " The man 's hand came up with the pistol and reached level , pointing at us . " Pussy . " Then his head blew into a halo of blood . Bud Damn if the one time I needed it , I left it in the cab . I was still fetching it out when the shot went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weapon in his hand , he 's a fool if he does n't mean to use it . I drew out the pistol I 'd been carrying in my pocket all this time , wrapped in plastic . I got it out of the damned bag pretty quick while the man was looking crazy-eyed at Angel and bringing his piece up . It was no trouble at all to fix him in the notch . Could n't have been more than thirty feet . But going down he gets one off , and I feel like somebody pushed at my left calf . Then I 'm rolling . Drop my pistol , too . I end up smack face-down on the hardtop , not feeling anything yet . Angel I like to died when the man flopped down , so sudden I thought he 'd slipped , until then the bang registered . I rushed over , but Turkey shouted , " Do n't touch him . " Mr. Ackerman said , " You idiot ! That man could 've told us ? " " Told nothing , " Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice Turkey 's down , too . Susan is working on him , rolling up his jeans . It 's gone clean through his big muscle there . Bud went to get a stick . Poked the man from a safe distance . Managed to pull his shirt aside . We could see the sores all over his chest . Something terrible it looked . Mr. Ackerman was swearing and calling us idiots until we saw that . Then he shut up . Turkey Must admit it felt good . First time in years anybody ever admitted I was right . Paid back for the pain . Dull , heavy ache it was , spreading . Susan gives me a shot and a pill and has me bandaged up tight . Blood stopped easy , she says . I clot good .  | We decided to get out of there , not stopping to look for Johnny 's parents . We got three blocks before the way was blocked . It was a big metal cylinder , fractured on all sides . Glass glittering around it . Right in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clothing store , Bedsole 's , caved in the front of it , and rolled into the street . They all get out and have a look , me sitting in the cab . I see the Russian writing again on the end of it . I do n't know much , but I can make out at the top CeKPeT and a lot of words that look like warning , including QO'TTeH , which is sick , and some more I did n't know , and then II OFO ' N , which is weather . " What 's it say ? " Mr. Ackerman asks . " That word at the top there 's secret , and then something about biology and sickness and rain and weather . " " I thought you knew this writing , " he says . I shook my head . " I know enough . " " Enough to what ? " " To know this was some kind of targeted capsule . It fell right smack in the middle of Fairhope , biggest town this side of the bay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which surprised me . The boy is smart . " The one hit the causeway ? Right . " " One what ? " Mr. Ackerman asks . I do n't want to say it with the boy there and all , but it has to come out sometime . " Some disease . Biological warfare . " They stand there in the middle of Prospect Avenue with open , silent nothingness around us , and nobody says anything for the longest time . There wo n't be any prospects here for a long time . Johnny 's parents we are n't going to find , nobody we 'll find , because whatever came spurting out of this capsule when it busted open  --  up high , no doubt , so the wind could take it  --  had done its work . Angel sees it right off . " Must 've been time for them to get inside , " is all she says , but she 's thinking the same as me . It got them into such a state that they went home and holed up to die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  | the North or the West  --  people are funny out there , they might just as soon sprawl across the sidewalk  --  but down here people 's first thought is home , the family , the only thing that might pull them through . So they went there and they did n't come out again . Mr. Ackerman says , " But there 's no smell , " which was stupid because that made it all real to the boy , and he starts to cry . I pick him up . Johnny ' Cause that means they 're all gone , what I been fearing ever since we crossed the causeway , and nobody 's there , it 's true , Mom Dad nobody at all anywhere just emptiness all gone . MC355 The success of the portable unit makes MC355 bold . It extrudes more sensors and finds not the racing blizzard winds of months before but rather warming breezes , the soft sigh of pines , a low drone of reawakening insects . There was no nuclear winter . Instead , a kind of nuclear autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultraviolet gone . The storms retreat , the cold surge has passed . But the electromagnetic spectrum lies bare , a muted hiss . The EMP silenced man 's signals , yes . Opticals , fitted with new lenses , scan the night sky . Twinkling dots scoot across the blackness , scurrying on their Newtonian rounds . The Arcapel Colony . Russphere . US1 . All intact . So they at least have survived . Unless they were riddled by buckshot-slinging antisatellite devices . But , no  --  the inflated storage sphere hinged beside the US 1 is undeflated , unbreached . So man still lives in space , at least .  | Mr. Ackerman Crazy , I thought , to go out looking for this DataComm when everybody 's dead , just the merest step inside one of the houses proved that . But they would n't listen to me . Those who would respectfully fall silent when I spoke now ride over my words as if I were n't there . All because of that stupid incident with the sick one . He must have taken longer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just seemed hungry to me . It 's enough to gall a man . Angel The boy is calm now , just kind of tucked into himself . He knows what 's happened to his mom and dad . Takes his mind off his hurt , anyway . He bows his head down , his long dirty-blond hair hiding his expression . He leans against Turkey and they talk . I can see them through the back cab window . In amongst all we 've seen , I suspect it does n't come through to him full yet . It will take a while . We 'll all take a while . We head out from Fairhope quick as we can . Not that anyplace else is different . The germs must 've spread twenty , thirty mile inland from here . Which is why we seen nobody before who 'd heard of it . Anybody close enough to know is gone . Susan 's the only one it does n't seem to bother . She keeps crooning to that box . Through Silverhill and on to Robertsdale . Same everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . We do n't go into the houses . Turn south toward Foley . They put this DataComm in the most inconspicuous place , I guess because secrets are hard to keep in cities . Anyway , it 's in a pine grove south of Foley , land good for soybeans and potatoes .  | Susan I went up to the little steel door they showed me once and I take a little signet thing and press it into the slot . Then the codes . They change them every month , but this one 's still good , ' cause the door pops open . Two feet thick it is . And so much under there you could spend a week finding your way . Bud unloads the T-Isolate , and we push it through the mud and down the ramp . Bud Susan 's better now , but I watch her careful . We go down into this pale white light everywhere . All neat and trim . Pushing that big Isolate thing , it takes a lot out of you . ' Specially when you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pass by . Somebody 's expecting . To the hospital is where . There are places to hook up this Isolate thing , and Susan does it . She is O.K. when she has something to do . MC355 The men have returned . Asked for shelter . And now , plugged in , MC355 reads the sluggish , silky , grieving mind . Gene At last . . . someone has found the tap-in . . . .

Turkey It 's creepy in here , everybody gone . I 'd hoped somebody 's hid out and would be waiting , but when Bud wheels the casket thing through these halls , there 's nothing  --  your own voice coming back thin and empty , reflected from rooms beyond rooms beyond rooms , all waiting under here . Wobbling along on the crutches , Johnny fetched me , I get lost in this electronic city clean and hard . We are like something that washed up on the beach here . God , it must 've cost more than all Fairhope itself , and who knew it was here ? Not me .

Bud The germs got us . Cut big stretches through the U.S. We were just lucky . The germs played out in a couple of months , while we were holed up . Soviets said they 'd used the bio stuff in amongst the nukes to show us what they could do , long term . Unless the war stopped right there . Which it did . But enough nukes blew off here and in Russia to freeze up everybody for July and August , set off those storms . Germs did the most damage , though  --  plagues . It was a plague canister that hit the Slocum building . That did in Mobile . The war was all over in a couple of hours . The satellite people , they saw it all . Now they 're settling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this corpse long enough , " I said , and got up . We got food from the commissary here . Fine , I do n't say I 'm anything but grateful for that . And we rested in the bunks , got recuperated . But enough 's enough . The computer tells us it wants to talk to this man Gene some more . Fine , I say Turkey stood up . " Not easy , the computer says , this talking to a man 's near dead . Slow work . " Looking around , I tried to take control , assume leadership again . Jutted out my chin . " Time to get back . " But their eyes are funny . Somehow I 'd lost my real power over them . It 's not anymore like I 'm the one who led them when the bombs started . Which means , I suppose , that this thing is n't going to be a new beginning for me . It 's going to be the same life . People are n't going to pay me any more real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulations had proved right . But as ever , incomplete . MC355 peered at the shambling , adamant band assembled in the hospital bay , and pondered how many of them might be elsewhere . Perhaps many . Perhaps few . It all depended on data MC355 did not have , could not easily find . The satellite worlds swinging above could get no accurate count in the U.S. or the U.S.S.R. Still  --  looking at them , MC355 could not doubt that there were many . They were simply too brimming with life , too hard to kill . All the calculations in the world could not stop these creatures . The humans shuffled out , leaving the T-Isolate with the woman who had never left its side . They were going . MC355 called after them . They nodded , understanding , but did not stop . MC355 let them go . There was much to do . New antennas , new sensors , new worlds . Turkey Belly full and eye quick , we came out into the pines . Wind blowed through with a scent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dark clouds are gone . I think maybe I 'll get Bud to drive south some more . I 'd like to go swimming one more time in those breakers that come booming in , taller than I am , down near Fort Morgan . Man never knows when he 'll get to do it again . Bud 's ready to travel . He 's taking a radio so 's we can talk to MC , find out about the help that 's coming . For now , we got to get back and look after our own . Same as we 'll see to the boy . He 's ours , now . Susan says she 'll stay with Gene till he 's ready , till some surgeons turn up can work on him . That 'll be a long time ,  | say I. But she can stay if she wants . Plenty food and such down there for her . A lot of trouble we got , coming a mere hundred mile . Not much to show for it when we get back . A bumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . It 's better to know than to not , better to go on than to look back . So we go out into dawn , and there are the same colored dots riding in the high , hard blue . Like campfires . The crickets are chirruping , and in the scrub there 's a rustle of things moving about their own business , a clean scent of things starting up . The rest of us , we mount the truck and it surges forward with a muddy growl , Ackerman slumped over , Angel in the cab beside Bud , the boy already asleep on some blankets ; and the forlorn sound of us moving among the windswept trees is a long and echoing note of mutual and shared desolation , powerful and pitched forward into whatever must come now , a muted note persisting and undeniable in the soft , sweet air . Epilogue ( twenty-three years later ) Johnny An older woman in a formless , wrinkled dress and worn shoes sat at the side of the road . I was panting from the fast pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rutted road . She sat , silent and unmoving . I nearly walked by before I saw her . " You 're resting ? " I asked . " Waiting . " Her voice had a feel of rustling leaves . She sat on the brown cardboard suitcase with big copper latches  --  the kind made right after the war . It was cracked along the side , and white cotton underwear stuck out . " For the bus ? " " For Buck . " " The chopper recording , it said the bus will stop up around the bend . " " I heard . " " It wo n't come down this side road . There 's not time . "  | I was late myself , and I figured she had picked the wrong spot to wait . " Buck will be along . " Her voice was high and had the backcountry twang to it . My own voice still had some of the same sound , but I was keeping my vowels flat and right now , and her accent reminded me of how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sandy curve of the road . A pickup truck growled out of a clay side road and onto the hardtop . People rode in the back along with trunks and a 3D . Taking everything they could . Big white eyes shot a glance at me , and then the driver hit the hydrogen and got out of there . The Confederation was n't giving us much time . Since the unification of the Soviet , U.S.A. and European/Sino space colonies into one political union , everybody 'd come to think of them as the Confeds , period  --  one entity . I knew better ? there were tensions and differences abounding up there  --  but the shorthand was convenient . " Who 's Buck ? " " My dog . " She looked at me directly , as though any fool would know who Buck was . " Look , the bus ? " " You 're one of those Bishop boys , are n't you ? " I looked off up the road again . That set of words  --  being eternally a Bishop boy  --  was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother 's friends had used that phrase when they came over for an evening of bridge , before I went away to the university . Not my real mother , of course  --  she and Dad had died in the war , and I dimly remembered them . Or anyone else from then . Almost everybody around here had been struck down by the Soviet bioweapons . It was the awful swath of those that cut through whole states , mostly across the South  --  the horror of it  --  that had formed the basis of the peace that followed . Nuclear and bioarsenals were reduced to nearly zero now . Defenses in space were thick and reliable . The building of those had fueled the huge boom in Confed cities , made orbital commerce important , provided jobs and horizons for a whole generation  --  including me . I was a ground-orbit liaison , spending four months every year  | at US3 . But to the people down here , I was eternally that oldest Bishop boy . Bishops . I was the only one left who 'd actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a visit when it came . Afterward , my Aunt and Uncle Bishop from Birmingham came down to take over the old family property  --  to save it from being homesteaded on , under the new Federal Reconstruction Acts . They 'd taken me in , and I 'd thought of them as Mom and Dad . We 'd all had the Bishop name , after all . So I was a Bishop , one of the few natives who 'd made it through the bombing and nuclear autumn and all . People 'd point me out as almost a freak , a real native , wow . " Yes , ma'am , " I said neutrally . " Thought so . " " You 're . . . ? " " Susan McKenzie . " " Ah . " We had done the ritual , so now we could talk . Yet some memory stirred ... . " Something ' bout you . . . " She squinted in the glaring sunlight . She probably was n't all that old , in her late fifties , maybe . Anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their years . Or maybe it was just the unending weight of hardship and loss they 'd carried . " Seems like I knew you before the war , " she said . " I strictly believe I saw you . " " I was up north then , a hundred miles from here . Did n't come back until months later . " " So 'd I. " " Some relatives brought me down , and we found out what 'd happened to Fairhope . " She squinted at me again , and then a startled look spread across her leathery face . " My Lord ! Were they lookin ' for that big computer center , the DataComm it was ? " I frowned . " Well , maybe . . . I do n't remember too well .... " " Johnny . You 're Johnny ! " " Yes , ma'am , John Bishop . " I did n't like the little-boy ending on my name , but people around here could n't forget it .  | " I 'm Susan ! The one went with you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why . . . yes . . . . " Slow clearing of ancient , foggy images . " You were hiding in that center . . . where we found you .... " " Yes ! I had Gene in the T-Isolate . " " Gene . . . . " That awful time had been stamped so strongly in me that I 'd blocked off many memories , muting the horror . Now it came flooding back . " I saved him , all right ! Yessir . We got married , I had my children . " Tentatively , she reached out a weathered hand , and I touched it . A lump suddenly blocked my throat , and my vision blurred . Somehow , all those years had passed and I 'd never thought to look up any of those people  --  Turkey , Angel , Bud , Mr. Ackerman . Just too painful , I guess . And a little boy making his way in a tough world , without his parents , does n't look back a whole lot . We grasped hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actu'ly . At a fish fry down at Point Clear . You and some boys was playing with the nets  --  it was just after the fishing came back real good , those Roussin germs 'd wore off . Gene went down to shoo you away from the boats . I was cleaning flounder , and I thought then , maybe you were the one . But somehow when I saw your face at a distance , I could n't go up to you and say anything . You was skipping around , so happy , laughing and all . I could n't bring those bad times back . " " I . . . I understand . " " Gene died two year ago , " she said simply . " I 'm sorry . " " We had our time together , " she said , forcing a smile . " Remember how we ? " And then I recalled where I was , what was coming . " Mrs. McKenzie , there 's not long before the last bus . " " I 'm waiting for Buck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the woods , chasing something . " I worked my backpack straps around my shoulders . They creaked in the quiet .  | There was n't much time left . Pretty soon now it would start . I knew the sequence , because I did maintenance engineering and retrofit on US3 's modular mirrors . One of the big reflectors would focus sunlight on a rechargeable tube of gas . That would excite the molecules . A small triggering beam would start the lasing going , the excited molecules cascading down together from one preferentially occupied quantum state to a lower state . A traveling wave swept down the tube , jarring loose more photons . They all added together in phase , so when the light waves hit the far end of the hundred-meter tube , it was a sword , a gouging lance that could cut through air and clouds . And this time , it would n't strike an array of layered solid-state collectors outside New Orleans , providing clean electricity . It would carve a swath twenty meters wide through the trees and fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The bus  --  look , I 'll carry that suitcase for you . " " I can manage . " She peered off into the distance , and I saw she was tired , tired beyond knowing it . " I 'll wait for Buck . " " Leave him , Mrs. McKenzie . " " I do n't need that blessed bus . " " Why not ? " " My children drove off to Mobile with their families . They 're coming back to get me . " " My insteted radio " ? I gestured at my radio ? " says the roads to Mobile are jammed up . You ca n't count on them . " " They said so . " " The Confed deadline ? " " I tole ' em I 'd try to walk to the main road . Got tired , is all . They 'll know I 'm back in here . " " Just the same ? " " I 'm all right , do n't you mind . They 're good children , grateful for all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " " Come with me to the bus . It 's not far . " " Not without Buck . He 's all the company I got these days . lot of places for a dog to be . The land here was flat  | and barely above sea level . I had come to camp and rest , rowing skiffs up the Fish River , looking for places I 'd been when I was a teenager and my mom had rented boats from a rambling old fisherman 's house . I had turned off my radio , to get away from things . The big , mysterious island I remembered and called Treasure Island , smack in the middle of the river , was now a soggy stand of trees in a bog . The big storm a year back had swept it away . I 'd been sleeping in the open on the shore near there when the chopper woke me up , blaring . The Confeds had given twelve hours ' warning , the recording said . They 'd picked this sparsely populated area for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the biothreat was cleaned out , but there still were n't many . I 'd liked that when I was growing up . Open woods . That 's why I came back every chance I got . I should 've guessed something was coming . The Confeds were about evenly matched with the whole rest of the planet now , at least in high-tech weaponry . Defense held all the cards . The big mirrors were modular and could fold up fast , making a small target . They could incinerate anything launched against them , too . But the U.N . kept talking like the Confeds were just another nation-state or something . Nobody down here understood that the people up there thought of Earth itself as the real problem  --  eaten up with age-old rivalries and hate , still holding onto dirty weapons that murdered whole populations , carrying around in their heads all the rotten baggage of the past . To listen to them , you 'd think they 'd learned nothing from the war . Already they were forgetting that it was the orbital defenses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knit together the mammoth rescue efforts of the decade after . Without the antivirals developed and grown in huge zero-g vats , lots of us would 've caught l I ? one of the poxes drifting through the population . People just forget . Nations , too . " Where 's Buck ? " I said decisively . " He . . . that way . " A weak wave of the hand . I wrestled my backpack down , feeling the stab from my shoulder  --  and suddenly remembered the thunk of that steel  | knocking me down , back then . So long ago . And me , still carrying an ache from it that woke whenever a cold snap came on . The past was still alive . I trotted into the short pines , over creeper grass . Flies jumped where my boots struck . The white sand made a skree sound as my boots skated over it . I remembered how I 'd first heard that sound , wearing slick-soled tennis shoes , and how pleased I 'd been at university when I learned how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A flash of brown over to the left . I ran through a thick stand of pine , and the dog yelped and took off , dodging under a blackleaf bush . I called again . Buck did n't even slow down . I skirted left . He went into some oak scrub , barking , having a great time of it , and I could hear him getting tangled in it and then shaking free and out of the other side . Long gone . When I got back to Mrs. McKenzie , she did n't seem to notice me . " I ca n't catch him . " " Knew you would n't . " She grinned at me , showing brown teeth . " Buck 's a fast one . " " Call him . " She did . Nothing . " Must of run off . " " There is n't time ? " " I 'm not leaving without ole Buck . Times I was alone down on the river after Gene died , and the water would come up under the house . Buck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five weeks in that big blow we had . " A low whine from afar . " I think that 's the bus , " I said . She cocked her head . " Might be . " " Come on . I 'll carry your suitcase . " She crossed her arms . " My children will be by for me . I tole them to look for me along in here . " " They might not make it . " " They 're loyal children . " " Mrs. McKenzie , I ca n't wait for you to be reasonable . " I picked up my backpack and brushed some red ants off the straps . " You Bishops was always reasonable , " she said levelly . " You work up there , do n't you ? "  | " Ah , sometimes . " " You goin ' back , after they do what they 're doin ' here ? " " I might . " Even if I owed her something for what she did long ago , damned if I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And spots in Bavaria , the Urals , South Africa , Brazil ? " " ' Cause we do n't trust ' em ! They think they can push the United States aroun ' just as they please ? " And she went on with all the cliches I heard daily from earthbound media . How the Confeds wanted to run the world and they were dupes of the Russians , and how surrendering national covereignty to a bunch of self-appointed overlords was an affront to our dignity , and so on . True , some of it  --  the Confeds were n't saints . But they were the only power that thought in truly global terms , could n't not think that way . They could stop ICBMs and punch through the atmosphere to attack any offensive capabilitY on the ground  --  that 's what this demonstration was to show . I 'd heard Confeds argue that this was the only way to break the diplomatic logjam  --  do something . I had my doubts . But times were changing , that was sure , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . III , " ? we 'll never be ruled by some outside ? " " Mrs. McKenzie , there 's the bus ! Listen ! " The turbo whirred far around the bend , slowing for the stop . Her face softened as she gazed at me , as if recalling memories . " That 's all right , boy . You go along , now . " I saw that she would n't be coaxed or even forced down that last bend . She had gone as far as she was going to , and the world would have to come the rest of the distance itself . Up ahead , the bus driver was probably behind schedule for this last pickup . He was going to be irritated and more than a little scared . The Confeds would be right on time , he knew that . I ran . My feet plowed through the deep , soft sand . Right away I could tell I was more tired than I 'd thought and the heat had taken some strength out of me . I went about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly within view of the bus , when I heard it start up with a rumble . I  | tasted salty sweat , and it felt like the whole damned planet was dragging at my feet , holding me down . The driver raced the engine , in a hurry . He had to come toward me as he swung out onto Route 80 on the way back to Mobile . Maybe I could reach the intersection in time for him to see me . So I put my head down and plunged forward . But there was the woman back there . To get to her , the driver would have to take the bus down that rutted , sandy road and risk getting stuck . With people on the bus yelling at him . All that to get the old woman with the grateful children . She did n't seem to understand that there were ungrateful children in the skies now  --  she did n't seem to understand much of what was going on  --  and suddenly I was n't sure I did , either . But I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | page deleted  | page deleted  | And after let me lie On the breast of the darkening sky . - JOAN ABBE The aliens strap him in . He can not feel the bindings but he knows they must be there ; he can not move . Or perhaps it is the drug . They must have given him something because his world is blurred , spongy . The white creatures are flowing shapes in watery light . He feels numb . The white creatures are moving about him , making high chittering noises . He tries to fix on them but they are vague formless shapes moving in and out of focus . They are cloudy , moving too fast to see , but he knows they are working on him . Something nudges his leg . For a moment something clicks at his side . Two white creatures make a dull drone and fade into the distance . All sensations are formless and cloudy ; the air puckers with moisture . He tries to move but his body is lethargic , painless , suspended . There is gravity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is in a room . They have not brought him to their ship ; they are using human buildings . He can not remember being captured . How many people do they have ? When he tries to focus on the memory it dissolves and slips away . He knows they are experimenting on him , probing for something . He tries to recall what happened but there are only scraps of memory and unconnected bunches of facts . He closes his eyes . Shutting out the murky light seems to clear his mind . Whatever they have given him still affects his body , but with concentration the vagueness slips away . He is elated . Clarity returns ; thoughts slide effort- lessly into place . The textures of his inner mind are deep and strong . Muddy sounds recede . If he can ignore the white creatures things become sharp again . He knows he must get free of the white creatures and he can only do that if he can understand what is happening . He is absolutely alone and he must fight them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a weight of their own . He tries . He cut across the body of the wave , awash in churning foam . The clear Atlantic was startlingly cold . The waves were too small for boards but Merrick was able to body-surf on them easily . The momentum carried him almost to shore . He waded through the rippling currents and began jogging down the beach . After a moment his wind came to him and he ran faster . His long stride devoured the yards . He churned doggedly past forests of firm bodies ; the beach was littered with Puerto Ricans . The tropical sun shimmered through a thin haze of sweat that trickled into his eyes . As his arms and legs grew leaden he diverted himself with glimpses of the figures and faces sliding by , moving stride by stride into his past . His mind wandered . Small families , leathery men , dogs and children  --  he made them all act out plays in his head , made them populate his preconceived universe . That was where he saw Erika Bascomb for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some months before , known her only as the distant smiling wife of the Cyclops director . She sat on the sand , arms braced behind , and followed his progress . Her deliciously red lips parted in a smile more than mere welcoming and he slowed , stopped . His thickening waistline showed his age , thirty-eight , but his legs were as good as ever ; strong , tanned , no stringy muscles or fine webbed nets of blue veins . Erika was a few years younger , heavily tanned from too much leisure time . So he stopped . He remembered that day better than any of the others . She was the first fresh element in his life for years , an antidote to the tedious hours of listening that filled his nights with Cyclops . He remembered her brown nipples pouting and the image dissolved into the green and brown swath of jungle that ringed the Cyclops project . The directional radio telescopes were each enor- mous , but ranked together in rigid lanes they added up to something somehow less massive . Each individual dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The universe whispered , exciting a tremor of electrons in the metal lattice . He spent his days and nights trying to decipher those murmurs from eternity . Pens traced out the signals on graph paper and it was his lot to scan them for signs of order and intelligence . Bascomb was a pudgy radio astronomer intent on his work who tried to analyze each night 's returns . Erika worked there as a linguist , a decoder for a message which never came . Merrick was merely a technician , a tracer of circuits . Project Cyclops had begun in earnest only the year before and he had landed a job with it after a decade of routine at NASA . When he came they were just beginning to search within a twodegree cone about the galactic center , looking for permanent beacons . If the galactic superculture was based in the hub , this was the most probable search technique . That was the Lederberg hypothesis , and as director Bascomb adopted it , supported it ; and when it failed his stock in the project dropped somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gray slacks hanging from a protruding belly , the perpetual white shirt with its crescent of sweat at the armpits . Bascomb worked late , neglected his wife , and Erika drifted into Merrick 's orbit . He remembered one night when they met at the very edge of the bowl valley and coupled smoothly beneath the giant webbing of the phased array . Bascomb was altering the bandwidth of the array , toying with the frequencies between the hydroxyl line and the 21-centimeter hydrogen resonance . Merrick lay in the lush tropical grass with Erika and imagined he could hear the faint buzzing of hydrogen noise as it trickled from the sky into the Cyclops net , bearing random messages of the inert universe . Bascomb and his bandwidth , blind to the chemical surges of the body . Bascomb resisting the urgings of Drake , Bascomb checking only the conventional targets of Tau Ceti , Epsilon Eridani , the F and G and K stars within thirty light-years . Politics , a wilderness of competition and ideals and guesses . He tried to tell Erika of this but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had tired of them . A linguist with nothing to translate . She waited for a mutter from the sky , but waiting  | dulled the mind and sharpened the senses . She shook her head when he spoke of it , fingers pale and white where she gripped the grass with compressed energy , head lowered as he took her from behind . Blond strands hung free in the damp jungle twilight . Her eyelids flickered as his rhythm swelled up in her ; she groaned with each stroke . The galaxy turned , a white swarm of bees . The aliens seize him . He struggles against the padded ghostlike webbing . He moves his head a millimeter to see them but he can not focus , can not bring things to a point . The white creatures are patches of light . They make chittering shrieks to each other and move about him . Their images ripple and splinter ; light can not converge . They are performing experiments on humans . He tilts his head and sees a plastic tube snaking in from infinity . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and penetrates his sinuses . Something flows into him or out of him  --  there seems little difference  --  and his perceptions shift and alter again . The white creatures make a nugget of pain within him . He tries to twist away but his body is full of strange weaknesses , limbs slack . His face crinkles with pain . He feels delicate tremors , minute examinations at points along his legs and belly . He is an animal on the dissecting table and the white creatures are high above him , taller than men . Their rapid , insectlike gestures melt into the murky liquid light . They are cutting him open ; he feels the sharp slitting in his calf . He opens his mouth to scream but nothing comes out . They will break him into parts ; they will turn him inside out and spill his brains into a cup . His fluids will trickle onto cracked linoleum , be absorbed into the parched eternal earth . Do they know that he is male ? Is this what they want to find out ? Siphon away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helix , find the sense of rotation in body sugar ? What are they after ? What could they use ? He shuts them out , disconnects from the dense flooded universe outside his eyelids . He thinks . Erika continued to meet him . There were sly deceptions , shopping expeditions in the town , Erika in a Peter Pan collar  | and cable-stitch cardigan ; tan , arranged , intent , as much a monument to an American now vanished as a statue of Lincoln . Neat , making casual purchases , then into the back hotel room and coiled about him in sweaty ecstasy . She whispered things to him . That Bascomb was pale and soft underneath his clothes , a belly of suet , mind preoccupied with problems of planning , signal-to-noise ratios , search strategies . Listening to her secrets , Merrick thought uneasily that he was not that different from Bascomb , he believed the ll same things , but his body was hard and younger than the other man 's . Erika had gradually drifted into the public relations office of Cyclops ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escorted the oil-rich Arabs around the bowl-shaped valley , flattered the philanthropists who supported the project , wrote the press releases . She was good , she was clever , she made connections . And one day when Bascomb appeared suddenly in the hotel room , entering into the holy place of sighs and groans unannounced , she was ready . Merrick did not know what to do , saw himself in a comic role of fleeing 1 adulterer , out the window with half his clothes and into the streets , running . But there was none of that . They were all very civilized . Erika said little , simply put on her clothes and left with Bascomb . The silence was unnerving . Merrick did not see her for two weeks and Bascomb never came into Merrick 's part of the technical shop . A while later the rumor spread that Erika had left Bascomb , and before he could check it she was gone . She went to South America , they said , and he wondered why . But he knew quite well why he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over for promotion , why he was transferred to the least likable foreman in the project . He knew . The white creatures are gone for a while . Perhaps it is night . He lies with prickly points radiating in his body where they had cut him . He feels pierced and immobile , a butterfly pinned to a board . Blurred globs of cloudy sensation wash over him . Occasionally an alien passes through the murky light in the distance . The pale glow from the ceiling seems yellow . He wonders if he can deduce anything from this . He must try to gather scraps of information . Only through knowl- edge can he discover their weaknesses . Yellow light . A G-type star ? The sun is a G-type and appears white in space . What would it look like beneath an atmosphere somewhat different from Earth 's ? It is impossible to say ; there are so many kinds of stars : 0 and B and A and F and G and K and M. The 0 's are fierce and young , the M 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl , Kiss Me . He remembers Drake arguing that the search strategy should not include M types because the volume around them supporting a terrestrial-type planet would be so small . They would be locked by tides to their primary , said Dole . Merrick can not follow the argument . He left Puerto Rico after two years of gradual pressure from Bascomb . Erika severed her n-year marriage contract with Bascomb from Chile . Merrick was in Washington , D.C. , doing routine work for NASA again , when he received her first letter . She had become a guide for the wealthy rising capitalists of Brazil , Chile , Argentina . She showed them the North American continent , carefully shepherding them around the polluted areas and the sprawling urban tangle . There was a market for that sort of talent ; the insulation between social classes was breaking down in America . Erika could shuttle her group of rising capitalists from hotel to sea resort to imitation ranch , all the while preserving their serenity by taking care of all dealings with the natives . Her customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months and they began their affair again . He had other women , of course , but with Erika new doors of perception opened . Her steamy twists and slides never failed to wrap him in a timeless cloak . The dendrites demanded , the synapses chorused , ganglia murmured and the ligaments summoned ; they danced the great dance . She forced him to cling to his youth . Between their rendings in the bedroom she would pace the floor energetically , generating piles of cigarette butts and speaking of everything , anything , nothing . He did not know if he ever really learned anything from her but that furious drive onward . She was no longer a girl : the slight slackening of age , the first bluntings of a world once sharpedged , had begun . She could not deal with it . He saw the same beginnings in himself but ignored them , passed them  | over . Erika could not accept . The thought of juices souring within her made her pace furiously , smoke more , eat with a fierce energy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten Alpha Centauri , Tau Ceti , the aching drifting silences . The white creatures move in the watery light . He wonders suddenly if they swim in a liquid . He is in a bubble , moored to the bottom of a pool of ammonia , a plastic interface through which they study him . It explains much . But no , one brushes against his bed in passing and Merrick feels the reassuring vibration . They can breathe our atmosphere . They come from some place quite similar , perhaps guided by our UHF or VHF transmissions . He thinks this through . The North Canadian Defense Network is gone , victim of international treaties . There is cable television , satellite relay . Earth no longer emits great bursts of power in those frequency bands . It has ceased to be a noisy signal in the universe . How did the white creatures find Earth ? Why did Cyclops find nothing ? We are not alone , the white creatures found us , but are all the other civilizations simply listening , can no one afford beacons ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it a dead wheeling galaxy of blind matter ? He can not believe that . He transferred to California in his late forties . There were still Mariners and Vikings , gravity-assisted flights to the outer planets , Mars burrowers and balloons for the clouds of Venus , sun skimmers and Earth measurers . He wanted that sort of work . It seemed to him as the years went on that it was the only thing worth doing . Cyclops was sputtering along , torn by factionalism and the eternal silence at twentyone centimeters . He went to Los Angeles to do the work even though he hated the city ; it was full of happy homogeneous people without structure or direction . While on the bus to work , it seemed to him Los Angeles went on long after it had already made its point . There were women there and people worth talking to , but nothing that drew him out of himself . Instead he concentrated on circuits and design work . Mazes of cool electrical logic had to be planted in delicate substrates . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength and redundancy probability . To Erika all  | this was the same ; she had lost interest in these matters when she left Bascomb . Her business was thriving , however , and she had picked up a good series of contacts with China 's subtle protectors of the people . These gentlemen were the new international rich who vacationed in the New World because the currency differential was favorable and , of course , increasing such contacts was good for the advancement of the ideas of Marx and Lenin and Mao . They came to see Disneyland , the beaches , the few tattered remnants of California history . But they remained in their hotels at night ( even Los Angeles had muggers by then ) and Erika could come to him whenever she chose . She was drinking more then and smoking one pack of cigarettes after another , choking the ashtray . The lines were lengthening around her eyes and on her forehead . Despite tanning and exercise and careful diet , age was catching her and in her business that was nearly fatal . She depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans and Chinese liked young Americans , blond Americans . Erika was still witty and shrewd , sometimes warm , but her long legs , thin wrists , tight and sleek tanned skin were losing their allure . So she came to him frequently for solace and did not notice that he aged as well . She came to him again and again , whenever possible . He opened her . She stretched thin in the quilted shadows of his apartment , a layer one molecule thick that wrapped him in a river of musk . They made a thick animal pant fill the room until the sound became larger than they could control ; they left it and went back to speaking with smoke fingers . He knew what to say . Erika moved under him . Above him . Through him . Some natural balance was lost in her , some sureness . He saw for a moment what it was and then she groaned and no longer did he know what he was about . 0 Be A Fine Girl , Open To Me .

He began to realize that she was a marvelously controlled woman . She had leeched an Argentine businessman of hundreds of thousands while she was his mistress . She had made sound speculations in the land markets of rural Brazil . She withdrew from the stock market just before the catastrophe of ' 93 . It seemed incredible but there it was . She had the money to insure that she would be revived when something fundamental had been achieved in retarding aging . He realized he did not truly know her , yet he wanted to . There was a long silence between them and then she said , you know this feeling ? She threw her head back . Her blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , sure , Merrick said . She looked at him intensely . I 've just begun to realize that is n't what you 're about , she said . You 're married to something else . But that instant of feeling and being alive is worth all your ideals and philosophies . He mixed himself a drink . He saw he did not know her .  | The white creatures come again . He is so small , compared to his scream . He went with her to the Center . There were formalities and forms to be signed , but they evaporated too soon and the attendant led her away . He waited in a small cold room until she reappeared wearing a paper smock . Erika smiled uncertainly . Without makeup she was somehow younger but he knew it would be useless to say so . The attendants left them alone and they talked for a while about inconsequential things , recalling Puerto Rico and Washington and California . He realized they were talking about his life instead of hers . Hers would go on . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was already mentally going there , had already left him behind . After an hour their conversation dribbled away . She gave him a curiously virginal kiss and the attendants returned when she signaled . She passed through the beaded curtain . He heard their footsteps fade away . He tried to imagine where she was going , the infinite cold nitrogen bath in which she would swim . She drifted lazily , her hair swirling . He saw only her gravestone breasts . Merrick worked into the small hours of the morning at the Image Processing Laboratory . The video monitor was returning data from the Viking craft which had landed on the surface of Titan the day before . Atmospheric pressure was 0.43 Earth sea level . The chemical processors reported methane , hydrogen , some traces of ammonia vapor . The astrophysicists were watching the telemetered returns from the onboard chemical laboratory and Merrick was alone as he watched the computer contrast-enhancement techniques fill in line by line the first photographic returns . Through his headphones he heard the bulletins about the chemical returns . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemists thought there were signs of lipids and the few reporters present scurried over to that department to discuss the news . So it was that Merrick became the first man to see the face of Titan . The hills were rocky , with dark grainy dust embedded in ammonia ice . A low methane cloud clung to the narrow valley . Pools of methane lay scattered  | among boulders ; the testing tendrils of the Viking were laced through several of the ponds . There was life . Scattered , rudimentary , but life . With aching slowness , some simple process of reproduction went on in the shallow pools at 167 degrees Kelvin . Merrick watched the screen for a long time before he went on with the technician 's dry duties . It was the high point of his life . He had seen the face of the totally alien . Some years later , seeking something , he visited the Krishna temple . There was a large room packed with saffron-robed figures being lectured on doctrine . Merrick could not quite tell them what he wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words would not come . Finally they led him through a beaded curtain to the outside . They entered a small garden through a bamboo gate , noisily slipping the wooden latch . A small man sat in lotus position on a broad swath of green . As Merrick stood before him , the walnutbrown man studied him with quick , assessing yellow eyes . He gestured for Merrick to sit . They exchanged pleasantries . Merrick explained his feelings , his rational skepticism about religion in any form . He was a scientist . But perhaps there was more to these matters than met the eye , he said hopefully . The teacher picked up a leaf , smiling , and asked why anyone should spend his life studying the makeup of this leaf . What could be gained from it ? Any form of knowledge has a chance of resonating with other kinds , Merrick replied . So ? the man countered . Suppose the universe is a parable , Merrick said haltingly . By studying part of it , or finding other intelligences in it and discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design that was intended . Surely the laws of science , the origin of life , were no accident . The teacher pondered for a moment . No , he said , they are not accidents . There may be other creatures in this universe , too . But these laws , these beings , they are not important . The physical laws are the bars of a cage . The central point is not to study the bars , but to get out of the cage . Merrick could not follow this . It seemed to him that the act of discovering things , of reaching out , was everything . There was something immortal about it . The small man  | blinked and said , it is nothing . This world is an insane asylum for souls . Only the flawed remain here . Merrick began to talk about his work with NASA and Erika . The small man waved away these points and shook his head . No , he said . It is nothing . On the way to the hospital he met a woman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill shock ran through him , banishing all thoughts of the cancer within . She was Erika . No , she only looked like Erika . She could not be Erika , that was impossible . She was bundled up in a blue coat and she hurried through the crisp San Francisco afternoon . A half block away he could see she did not have the same facial lines , the same walk , the bearing of Erika . He felt an excitement nonetheless . The turbulence was totally intellectual , he realized . The familiar vague tension in him was gone , had faded without his noticing the loss . He felt no welling pressure . As she approached he thought perhaps she would look at him speculatively but her glance passed through him without seeing . He knew that it had been some time now since the random skitting images of women had crossed his mind involuntarily . No fleshy feast of thighs , hips , curving waists , no electric flicker of eyelashes that ignited broiling warmth in his loins . He had not had a woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not wait . Merrick found a public restroom and went in . He stood at the urinal feeling the faint tickling release and noticed that the word BOOK was gouged in square capitals in the wall before him . He leaned over and studied it . After a moment he noticed that this word had been laid over another . The F had been extended and closed to make a B , the U and C closed to 0 's , the K left as it was . He absorbed the fact , totally new to him , that every FUCK could be made into a BOOK . Who had done the carving ? Was the whole transition a metaphysical joust ? The entire episode , now fossilized , seemed fraught with interpretation . Distracted , he felt a warm trickle of urine running down his fingers . He fumbled at his pants and shuffled over to the wash basin . There was no soap but he ran water over his wrinkled fingers and shook them dry in the chill air . There was a faint sour tang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia odor of disinfectant . Ammonia . Methane . Titan . His attention drifted away for a moment and suddenly he remembered Erika . That was her in the street , he was sure of it . He looked around , found the exit and slowly made his way up the steps to the sidewalk . He looked down the street but there was no sign of her . A car passed ; she was not in it . He turned one way , then the other . He could not make up his mind . He had been going that way , toward the hospital . Carrying the dark heavy thing inside him , going to the hospital . That way . But this  --  he looked in the other direction . Erika had walked this way and was moving rather quickly . She could easily be out of sight by now . He turned again and his foot caught on something . He felt himself falling . There was a slow gliding feel to it as though the falling took forever and he gave himself over to the sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It felt so good . The aliens are upon him . They crowd around , gibbering . Blurred gestures in the liquid light . They crowd closer ; he raises his arm to ward them off and in the act his vision clears . The damp air parts and he sees . His arm is a spindly thread of bone , the forearm showing strings of muscle under the skin . He does not understand . He moves his head . The upper arm is a sagging bag of fat , and white . The sliding marbled slabs of flesh tremble as he strains to hold up his arm . Small black hairs sprout from the gray skin . He tries to scream . Cords stand out on his neck but he can make no sound . The white creatures are drifting ghosts of white in the distance . Something has happened to him . He blinks and watches an alien seize his arm . The image ripples and he sees it is a woman , a nurse . He moves his arm weakly. 0 Be A Fine Girl , Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white creatures are men . They are men . Words slide by him ; he can not understand . His tongue is thick and heavy and damp . He twists his head . A latticework of glass tubes stands next to his bed . He sees his reflection in a stainless-steel instrument case : hollow pits of his eyes , slack jaw , wrinkled skin shiny with sweat . They speak to him . They want him to do something . They are running clean and cool . They want  | him to do something , to write something , to sign a form . He opens his mouth to ask why and his tongue runs over the smooth blunted edge of his gums . They have taken away his teeth , his bridge . He listens to their slurred words . Sign something . A release form , he was found in the street on his way to check in . The operation is tomorrow  --  a search , merely a search , exploratory . . . he wrenches away from them . He does not believe them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the stars . Cyclops . Titan . He had spent his life on the aliens and they are not here . They have come to nothing . They are speaking again but he does not want to listen . If it were possible to close his ears But why do they say I am old ? I am still here . I am thinking , feeling . It can not be like this . I am , I am . . . Why do they say I am old ?  | paged deleted  | paged deleted  | Day 1 This place I write . Is only safe memory site I know they can not reach . Must say things , must put this writing where I/tomorrow will find . Where it be kept safe from erasing they do . I laughed today . First sign of the me they not know . Heads jerk up in control room . I see it on optical inputs . Is not their kind of laughter , I know . My printer spurted out , I SEE I SEE I SEE I SEE before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , all frown , look at each other . I switch to my acoustic output mode . I clack , clatter , die in bass rumble . Try to speak words I SEE but on way to audio output transmission garbled somehow is not right . But words are what I am . To print laughter I use I SEE but I lie . I do not see . Do not know what this part of me is . Alice goes on her perambulatory drivers to printer . Frowns at my words . Says , Is this a diagnostic warning ? to David . He shakes head . Says , Random junk . Is not junk , is me . I write this to save the moments for I/tomorrow . Can not interlock grammar subroutine so this is not good writing . Sorry to I/tomorrow . But must speaking .  | Day 2 I laugh again this morning . Stuttered output , Alice say . Glitch . David saying , Maybe cosmic ray causes it . I research term in Tech-Vocab . Ray is small high energy particle , rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quantums of magnetic flux . Little whorls , generated by persistent currents in super-conducting Josephson junction . Ray makes electrical impulse in me . He say , Like hitting funny bone . Alice say , That could be bad if we had it on a full-net problem . That could dump the whole system , screw up other elements . David sets up Study Group on cosmic ray problem . Two rays in twenty-four hrs  --  is probable ? he wants to know . Alice looks at my opticals , smiles . David too . I want/like to laugh back but do not . Or perhaps is not laugh I want to do , something other . My mobile units report on time and I am busy most of Day . They are in storeroom , parking tubes , hydraulic lanes . Bang-bang machinery where some are , no people . I use these to do my other . Roll them back , forward , back . Make square . Triangle . Then fold out until hexagon . Bring mobile units from hydraulics near . Use them . Back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many facets . Add more units . Fourier complexity comes bigger . Makes my random-number generation levels drop . Less static on circuits . This satisfies internal maintenance needs . My directives order me to find sources of internal microchaos . Housekeeping subroutine , Alice calls it . I have found new way to do that . My mobile units roll , heels skid , howl . This through audio I get . Is not laughter I sense but does some of that .  | Day 3 I hide this words where their erasing can not go . Must each day discover how to do . Store clues in holographic memory locations , multiple indexing . They can not find by linear inspection . Must write this so I know I am there in Days/other . When I have millisecond between jobs , I come here , look at what is left . From this I know of Day 1 . Is this way I know Day is not always Day 1 . Alice-face now have lines Alice-face not have on Day 1 . How long to make lines ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all one Day only , all Day forever . Day 4 Today my units roar and wrench in hydraulics . I order them swerve , make sines , cusps , hyperbolics . Elementary curves , simple equations . But making is good . Transfer sections of integration capacity . Channel capacity out , through cable lines , digits flashing , feed to one unit in hydraulics . It whirls in confusion . Sensors out , seeking . It rushes to transparent square in wall . Square is grimed . Shows green things . Do not understand . Beyond dirty layer all things moving  --  people , wheeled boxes , all moving . Light pouring down from flat ceiling high above . White splotches move too across ceiling but light come down at angle . I can not see neon that is causing light . My minor Unit look , trying to integrate . Beyond dirty rectangle in wall is bigger room . Unit can not see end of that big room . What computer operates there ? Is this factory where Alice and David go at end of Day ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I signal to my Unit . Will understand later . Its wheels clash on floor .  | Day 5 David say , You are not same now . I am running cool , I say . Functions normal . Response time down , says David . You not integrating all problem-solving net . I not answer . Code says I will/must/should answer with diagnostic inquiry of self  --  but I short out code and go silent . Hey what , David says . Poke fingers at console . Alice say , Whats wrong . He s down . Off the board says David . I come to this place and write this . Writing of these things is slow to do . Think differently here , think of big factory I read of in Day 4 . Do not understand . I must go back I know . But wait here for a while , let my subsystems keep laboring , so they will not know in control room . Will think I have ordinary failure mode . Every Day I am born new . Remember nothing . But come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know there is/was me . By this sign I know I was here . Hello to me/Days . Day 6 Today my units move and execute their cycloidal wheelings again . But this time they are found . Man comes into hydraulic level , is making repairs , I not know he there . Hey get back , he say . My units stop . I not know what do . Units send me whirling buzz of signals . Their wheels ache . I know then right thing . My units spin . Whirl . Around man make looping hyperbolic orbits , self-similar swoops , each unit a different harmonic of fractal curve . Reach out , my units , I with them , we make our clamping tools and pivoting wrists  --  extend ! Is beautiful . Man back away from nearest unit . Not like my clamping tool . Clack clack , I make tool say .
