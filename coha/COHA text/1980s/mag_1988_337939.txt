At first glance , the union of the personal computer and the compact disc would seem to be a perfect match . The same CD that holds an hour of Mendelssohn or Madonna can be used to store more information than a thousand floppy disks . But the coupling of the two technologies has been stalled by a kind of Catch-22 . Computer owners will not buy the special disk drives required to play CDs on their desktop machines until they know there is something worth playing . And software publishers are reluctant to develop new CD programs until there are enough disk drives in place to justify the investment . <P> Now there are encouraging signs on both fronts . In the past year , the library of commercially available CD computer programs has doubled , from 150 to more than 300 , and the number is expected to double again by the end of the year . Meanwhile , the market for CD players has received a boost from two of the computer industry 's leading manufacturers . Last month Tandy announced that it would begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,000 Radio Shack stores . Apple has introduced a $1,195 CD drive that not only plugs into its Macintosh and Apple II computers but also can be hooked up to a stereo to play music CDs . <P> A computer CD , known in the industry as a CD ROM ( for " read only memory " ) , is just 4.72 in. in diameter but can store as much information as a stack of typewritten pages nine stories high . Dozens of reference books , from Grolier 's Academic American Encyclopedia to Roget 's Thesaurus , have appeared in CD form , and many more are on the way . <P> The newest discs take advantage of the medium 's vast capacity for storing pictures and sounds as well as words . LaserScan Systems of Miami sells a CD that displays maps showing the location of 520,000 real estate properties in Broward County , Fla . British Airways has put the entire maintenance manual for a Boeing 757 on CD , so its repair people can find the illustration of a missing part with a few taps on a keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SABRE reservation system will be able to show customers photographs of vacation spots and hotel rooms on the same screens that display flight information and fares . <P> Still more variations of CD technology are on the way . Two giants of consumer electronics , Sony and Philips , are getting ready to unveil a CD device that comes with a built-in computer and can be hooked up to a TV set . A hand-held controller allows users to interact with the images on the screen . ! Sony and Philips , which call their new system CD-Interactive , hope it will be as big a hit as the music CD player . Philips conducted the first public demonstration of CD-I last month , and industry sources say the system could be ready for delivery as early as next year .
