After a rush of praise , his antinuclear book draws skepticism <P> Few issues covered by the nation 's press are as emotional as the effect of nuclear weapons in causing or averting war . Once reporters begin , as many find it irresistible to do , by evoking images of a fiery doomsday , it is hard to shift readers ' attention to cold-eyed consideration of deterrence . The impulse in much of the public is simply to cry out for ridding the planet of such weapons . <P> Exactly that sweeping solution-and a worldwide government of unspecified political complexion to carry it out-is the immodest proposal of the antinuclear movement 's rallying point , Jonathan Schell 's The Fate of the Earth . The book first appeared as three articles in The New Yorker and met wide acclaim among opinion leaders . Walter Cronkite said it " may be one of the most important works of recent years . " Washington Post Columnist Mary McGrory said that the book was " working its way into the national psyche . " Even journalists who disagreed with Schell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times , treated the book with respect because of its import for the antinuclear movement . <P> But a growing number of commentators are now skeptical . In the May issue of Harper 's , Editor Michael Kinsley writes : " Schell 's . . . pretentious . . . essay well illustrates the confusion of the antinuclear movement . " The heart of Kinsley 's argument is that Schell too readily subordinates " liberty , " " national sovereignty " and other values to " survival , " because the only possible outcomes he sees to nuclear confrontation are annihilation or peace at any price . Contends Kinsley : " To Schell , apparently , all considerations apart from the danger of nuclear war are mere distractions . " <P> Syndicated Columnist Max Lerner , in a sternly critical review in a stronghold of Democratic liberalism , the New Republic , complains that Schell 's logic could be used to justify " certain surrender through unilateral disarmament by the West . " The New York Times editorial page , another traditionally liberal forum , has faulted Schell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper notes , " are left in the real world , stuck with the only available alternative to catastrophe . Deterrence it will have to be . " Times Book Critic John Leonard , a one-time liberal activist on issues ranging from the Viet Nam War to the Helsinki human rights accords , is even more dismissive . He says that Schell " has n't a clue " about the practical problems of disarmament and that his philosophizing " flirts with the preposterous . " <P> More predictably , the right-leaning Wall Street Journal has lambasted Schell as " destructive of serious thought about how to prevent war and control the spread of nuclear arms . " Especially ludicrous , the paper says , is his call for " nothing less than to reinvent politics . " Cracks the Journal : " Like , wow , man . "
