CLEVELAND  --  Robert B. Horton is getting his reward for a job well done  --  a 60% pay cut . The 48-year-old vice chairman and chief executive officer of BP America Inc. " will go back to a British salary , " dropping off the much more lucrative U.S. executive payroll , when he transfers to London in April to rejoin the governing board of the parent , British Petroleum Co . Instead of the nearly $1 million he made in 1986 as head of Standard Oil Co. , predecessor company to BP America , Mr. Horton will receive only a little more than $400 , 000 a year as one of seven managing directors of BP . However , with the transfer comes a good shot eventually of snaring the chief executive ' s spot at BP , one of the world ' s largest oil companies . As chief executive of North America ' s largest foreign-owned company in North America , Mr. Horton has had an opportunity to savor life in the U.S. executive suite . He ' s reveled in it . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role model for the growing number of foreign top executives being swept here by the rising tide of overseas investment in U.S.-based businesses . Although he and a handful of associates were dispatched by BP in early 1986 to replace Standard Oil ' s top American executives , there appears to have been little hostility . To the contrary , the Briton has quickly become one of the most popular members of this city ' s social elite . More important , he ' s won respect in the financial and oil circles in New York and Texas , while even learning to enjoy the Washington lobbying game . " Compared to Britain , the social side of life is very important in U.S. business , " Mr. Horton says . " If you throw yourself into it , you can enjoy yourself . " He ' s been successful , too , with BP America . He began by restructuring what BP considered an overweight Standard Oil , trimming expenses and selling nonproductive assets and units that didn ' t fit into future plans . Last May , after BP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock it didn ' t own , Mr. Horton guided the melding of Standard with BP ' s other North American assets , thus forming BP America . That combination placed Mr. Horton in charge of about 53% of BP ' s total assets and responsible for generating just over half of its profit . " He ' s done a superb job , " says Jack N. Aydin , oil analyst with McDonald &; Co . , Cleveland . " He ' s a model executive , doing what needs to be done but , at the same time , being very people-oriented . He improved morale within the company and the company ' s image . " His success here , coupled with previous experience as BP ' s chief financial officer and head of its chemical operations , makes Mr. Horton a top candidate for BP chief executive when Sir Peter Walters steps down , probably in three or four years . ( That job pays about two-thirds of what Mr. Horton made at Standard Oil . ) Mr. Horton isn ' t bashful about claiming he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found it . " The company is significantly changed , " he declares , " from one that was a mediocre performer to one that is an excellent one . " Furthermore , he says , " people ' s tails are well up , I think . " Mr. Horton minimized resistance to what he considered necessary changes by being accessible , explaining to people inside and outside the company what he was doing . He has been aided by a skill with words that he attributes to the greater emphasis placed on writing and speaking in British schools . ( However , he does use American speech writers . ) Even his self-styled " funny accent " has helped him win over a wide range of audiences , from employees to civic groups . In addition , he adroitly stayed out of a battle last spring between BP and a group of independent Standard Oil directors and dissident shareholders over the price BP was to pay for the minority shares . An executive , to be sure , looks a lot smarter if there are some lucky breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he arrived in Cleveland , the price of crude oil was about $10 a barrel , and falling . It subsequently recovered , buoying the company ' s fortunes . The price of copper , another significant product , has soared to more than double what Mr. Horton thought it would fetch . His timing was fortunate in another respect . As 1986 began , Standard appeared to be floundering . The previous management had failed in efforts to build a future income stream to replace the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field when it runs dry . And the coal , copper and industrial products businesses acquired at tremendous cost were running large losses on a combined basis . Furthermore , oil and gas exploration programs were consuming huge amounts of cash but failing to locate big new fields . Thanks to further development of previously discovered reserves in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico , BP America is one of the few North American oil producers that pumped more crude oil last year than in 1986 . And it ' s poised for another increase in 1988 , some analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proven oil reserves by 446 million barrels , to a total of 2. 96 billion barrels , partly because of its success in extending the expected life of the Prudhoe Bay field . Previous management had made charge-offs totaling $1. 86 billion in 1985 , and slashed employment by 2 , 100 that year . Many Standard employees feared further massive cutbacks . Cleveland leaders were concerned that corporate headquarters  --  and the related support for cultural and philanthropic causes  --  would move out of town , possibly to Houston . Mr. Horton did make selective cuts , but Clevelanders were relieved he didn ' t swing a scythe . Corporate headquarters stayed on Cleveland ' s Public Square . In fact , Mr. Horton has become an ardent city booster , deploring Cleveland jokes and boasting about the " tremendous quality of life one can enjoy in this city . " To live in a house deep in the woods of Hunting Valley and still be in my office in 35 minutes " was a welcome change , says Mr. Horton , who notes he ' s " country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending the week in a house in the city and the weekend in a country house . " It isn ' t nearly so satisfying , " he says . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
