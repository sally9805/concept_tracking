For shame , sir . For shame Your Dec. 28 editorial " A Bad Bet " exhibits in its review of casino gaming in Atlantic City the self righteous moralizing one customarily finds in The New York Times ; the superficial analysis which exhausts the intellectual resources of both writers and readers of the Philadelphia Inquirer ; and the shortsightedness  --  understandable , if not totally forgivable  --  of The Atlantic City Press . In fairness , you cite the positive findings of the Sternlieb/Hughes study  --  the fivefold increase in the City ' s ratable base ; $36 million in property taxes ; $117 million in gross revenue taxes for the State . But you follow these facts with frightening statistics on the percentage increase in crime , without noting the far greater increase in the number of visitors to Atlantic City since the opening of the casinos . And , surely , it is to that transient population increase that the crime increase is attributable . And , as if superficiality is contagious , you speak of the casinos " like huge vampires , sucking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rents . " The fact , sir , is that casinos might well expect a charge of necrophagia  --  though they would to be sure raise a strong defense against it  --  but one of vampirism is absurd . The " traditional small businesses " of which you speak were terminally ill in the deteriorating conditions of pre-casino Atlantic City . And the coming of the Dice Age only served to provide an externally inspired rationalization of what was a genuinely internally caused demise . Most depressing of all is your question " of where the surplus income and savings of losers at the tables and slot machines would have gone , and how much business activity and tax revenue they would have generated , in the absence of casino gambling . " Truly , sir , does it matter ? Can such a question really matter to The Wall Street Journal ? The only certain answer is that those revenues would not , alas , have been spent in this community ; that more than 30 , 000 new jobs would not have been created in this new industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually would not have been raised from casino taxation and made available for senior citizen programs in New Jersey . Atlantic City is not yet , to be sure , an East Coast Utopia . But that is attributable not to any inherent deficiencies in casino gaming ; not to any excessive selfishness on the part of casino management . The blame for our condition lies with a State Government distinguished only by its intellectual bankruptcy ; a local government noted only for its moral inadequacies ; a local business community characterized , for the most part , by a three-month " **26;54;TOOLONG " mentality , followed by a nine-month " **34;82;TOOLONG " attitude ; and by regulatory authorities infinitely more concerned with the assertion of bureaucratic prerogatives and the aggrandizement of inflated egos than with the exercise of essential regulatory responsibilities . Whatever " social costs " the citizens of Atlantic City may have borne , and , indeed , are bearing today as a result of casino gaming , are attributed not to the industry , but , rather , to the woeful mismanagement , misunderstanding , and misplaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at their doors that blame for the " moral impact " of casino gaming is most appropriately placed . For the greatest moral impact of all is that the creative energies of an exciting industry have never , by government , been properly harnessed to serve the best interests of the people . J. Mark Reifer Executive Vice President Braymes &; Associates Atlantic City , N.J.  --  - That Atlantic City gambling turned out to be " A Bad Bet " and a poor example for the Pocono Mountains to follow is like saying Sun City , Ariz. , should never have been built because crime is more prevalent among the old and retired in New York City . Would not Lake Tahoe , Las Vegas , or even Reno be a more appropriate example of resort area gambling than the slums of Atlantic City ? Hans Kaufmann Baton Rouge , La.
