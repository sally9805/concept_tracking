The $3. 9 billion drought-relief bill and Congress ' fast action in approving it are generally being applauded by the nation ' s major farm organizations . Though farm groups agree that the legislation will help farmers survive the worst drought in 50 years , they disagree over some provisions of the bill . " We got 80 percent of what we recommended , Congress worked expeditiously , and we ' re fairly satisfied , " commented a spokesman for the National Farmers Union . " We think it will be of some help to farmers , but we were disappointed that dairy farmers did not get stronger price supports to offset increased feed costs . " The National Farmers Organization described the bill as " reasonable overall . " " We have reservations about some provisions , but overall we approve of the bill , " said a National Grange spokesman . While urging President Reagan to sign the bill , which he did last Thursday , Dean Kleckner , president of the American Farm Bureau Federation , said the bill contains " some troubling provisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-pocket production expenses in a prompt and effective manner , " Kleckner said . " This approach also avoids the kind of problems caused by the extension of low- interest loans , which has often led to loan repayment problems . " A provision that farm groups disagree about requires a means test for receiving program benefits . Basically , crop producers with gross income of $2 million and livestock producers with gross income of $2. 5 million would be ineligible for payments . Robert Frederick , legislative director of the Grange , described it as the " most significant provision in the package " because this is the first time in the history of farm legislation that Congress has required a means test . Frederick said the Grange favors the provision because it " sees no social benefits in using government funds to maintain ' megafarms . ' " Kleckner , on the other hand , said the Farm Bureau takes " strong exception " to a gross income test for determining eligibility for disaster payments . " It discriminates against producers solely on size with no regard to actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fundamental change in farm policy that should have been debated more fully during a nonemergency situation . " The National Farmers Union complained that Congress ignored its recommendation for a permanent boost in dairy price supports of 50 cents per 100 pounds of milk , effective Oct. 1 . Instead , the bill rescinded a 50-cent decrease in milk supports scheduled for next Jan. 1 and authorized a 50-cent increase for three months , effective next April 1 . Kleckner called the 50-cent increase " unfortunate ( because ) it undermines the concepts of the 1985 farm bill and extends relief to a whole industry without recognition to individual needs or losses . " Among the bill ' s positive features , said Kleckner , is the additional assistance it will provide , beyond the measure ' s basic payment rates , to crop producers who suffered losses of more than 75 percent . Instead of the bill ' s basic rate of 65 percent payments for losses of more than 35 percent , the hardest hit group will be eligible for payments of 90 percent of the target price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the provision limiting feed assistance to livestock producers who grow their own feed . The Senate version of the bill would have extended aid to feed purchasers . Kleckner said the Senate version would have added $2 billion to the bill ' s cost and might have triggered across-the-board budget cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
