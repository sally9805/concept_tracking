Assemblyman Reuben Canoy told TIME that a supporter of Marcos ' had offered the equivalent of $1.3 million to Canoy if he would challenge the President . Canoy turned the opportunity down . A longtime Marcos ally eventually surfaced as a candidate : Alejo Santos , 69 , the fourth choice of the Nacionalista Party , which has generally supported the Marcos regime .
