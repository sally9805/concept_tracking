// THE KIDNEY STONE FORMERS CLUB ! by Cory SerVaas , M.D. f the countless thousands of sufferers who have consorted with the pain of stones , Benjamin Franklin was one of the most notable . A large bladder stone , unlocatable by the medical techniques of his day , remained with him from 1783 until he died in 1790 . Rather than submit to surgery , when the stone grew to such a size that it settled over his bladder opening and occasionally prevented the passing of urine , he tried his own remedies for relief . One that failed was a solution of lye and lime water , which he drank to dissolve the interloper . He then reasoned , correctly , that if he stood on his head , gravity would cause the stone to fall away , permitting him to empty his bladder . To facilitate the process , he invented the catheter , a flexible tube that could be inserted to help him draw off his urine . ( Franklin always believed that the catheter was one of his best contributions to mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Poor Richard 's Almanac . ) Upon leaving France for home , Franklin was unable to stand the pain of riding in a carriage , so Queen Marie Antoinette loaned him two of her large mules to pull him on a litter from Paris to the English Channel , where he boarded a boat for America . The last remedies he is known to have tried were blackberry jellies and a daily warm bath . But when he died of pleurisy on April 14 , 1790 , his stone was still intact . If Franklin believed that the flexible catheter was his most important contribution to mankind , his spirit must have been lifted when , on July 17 , 1981 , while gazing earthward , he beheld a group of his admirers and fellow sufferers gathered in the Benjamin Franklin Society Library . These latter-day stone formers had assembled to be linked , with the help of a friendly telephone conference call operator , to other kidney-stone victims throughout the country . They were members of the Benjamin Franklin Kidney Stone Formers Club , which will be referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps this group may one day give Franklin 's spirit even more satisfaction than did his flexible catheter , for these men showed boundless enthusiasm for a new way to relieve stone suffering and , yes , to avoid the scalpel . They were men from all walks of life : an oral surgeon in Pittsburgh , a rubber-company worker in Des Moines , an investment broker in Houston , a pediatrician in Los Angeles , a furniture magnate in Indianapolis  --  all bound by the common bond of having suffered the singular agony of a kidney stone . Benjamin Franklin would have rejoiced over what was about to unfold . There , in the library named as a tribute to him , sat a local group of stone formers , all having known the excruciating pain of a stone , and some having already submitted once or more to the dreaded scalpel . Above the assemblage a large wall decoration in carved wooden letters announced : " We can make these times better if we bestir ourselves . " ... Benjamin Franklin . There was a spirit of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the callers announcing themselves via the speaker phone to the local group as Dr. Landrum Boiling , president of the Benjamin Franklin Literary &; Medical Society , of which the Club is an offshoot , introduced the speaker .... But before we begin , let me explain the origins of the Club . It had its beginnings , I suppose , last January when my husband 's kidney stone suddenly doubled him up with pain at President Reagan 's inaugural ceremonies , forcing him to beat an immediate retreat , still in his formal attire , to nearby Fairfax Hospital for a quick fix of morphine . His full dress and the diagnosis of a stone amused the residents and nurses . Compared to diagnoses of malignancies and other dreaded diseases , which so regularly elicit their sympathies , it is somewhat of a relief when such severe pain is found to be due to " nothing but a stone , " which can pass in the urine , leaving the patient as whole as ever . But if the diagnosis brings joy and relief to the medical personnel , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a future attack is intense . One man we knew carried his pain-killers around with him for years after his stone passed , just in case of another attack . It was thus in this climate of fear of future attacks that we called Dr. Christian Chaussy in Munich , Germany , who , we had learned , had developed a method of pulverizing stones with shock-wave impulses delivered outside the body . Dr. Chaussy was n't at all encouraging , however , since his research grant from the German government covered workonly on stones in the kidney and not in the ureter , as was the stone in my husband 's case . Because his method seemed to offer others such a favorable alternative to surgery , however , it seemed worthwhile to investigate the technique . So we flew to the Klinikum Grosshadern in Munich , Germany , to meet this innovative young man and his team of researchers . Impressive and soft-spoken , speaking fluent English with a candid manner , he made us confident that he was a careful investigator who proceeded in all of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominate him for the highest honor of the Benjamin Franklin Literary &; Medical Society , the coveted Benjamin Franklin Award , and we invited him to the Society 's headquarters in April when he was to give a paper on his stone research to the American Society of Urologists in Boston . Along with his charming wife who is also a physician , he visited the urology departments of the Indiana University School of Medicine and Methodist Hospital and ended the visit by accepting the Award in the same Benjamin Franklin Library where his would-be patients later assembled . Many of the stone sufferers , anxious to have their stones removed , had read of Dr. Chaussy 's work and about the Club ; now they would hear from Dr. James Nicolette , a fellow club member from Pittsburgh , as he described how his stone had been removed by Dr. Chaussy in Munich . ( At this writing , he is the first and only U.S. patient to have had his stone pulverized in this manner . ) Dr. Nicolette , an oral surgeon from Mt . Pleasant , Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to yield to the scalpel . After Dr. Chaussy returned to Germany from his trip to the U.S. , he agreed to treat Dr. Nicolette if his stone could be visualized by x-ray . At 8:30 on a Thursday morning in May of this year , Dr. Nicolette entered the x-ray room in Munich . A flatplate abdominal x-ray was taken , and his kidney stone was visible in the kidney pelvis . Given a spinal anesthetic and catheterized , he was wheeled to the specially equipped procedure room . Here , his legs and shoulders were strapped into a harness , and the area from the torso to the knees was completely bared . He was lowered into a tank of water as two x-ray units connected to television monitors pinpointed the stone 's location . When his body was correctly positioned , an electromechanical device produced a series of shock waves in the water , which struck his flank with the force of a slap on the back . Anesthetized , he felt no pain  --  only the pressure . Fifty of these energy-charged impulses penetrated his suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ( a clinical manifestation that the stone was being pulverized as the stone particles produced mild irritation of the bladder wall ) . The culprit stone was then bombarded with some 500 more shock waves to pulverize the stone completely . Removed from the tank , the patient was x-rayed again . The stone had vanished from the scene . He was then taken to the intensive care unit until sensation returned to his legs . " There was no pain whatsoever , " Dr. Nicolette happily reported . " I was in the tank two hours , then in intensive care two hours and back in my room about 1:00 p.m . The stone , measuring approximately one-half inch by three-quarters of an inch , had been so finely pulverized that I honestly did not know that I was passing it . " The next day Dr. Nicolette and his wife went sightseeing in Munich . If the question arises , " Why would the doctor go all the way to Munich to have his kidney stone turned into powder ? " the answer is simple : Munich is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain-free procedure is available . Why , then , are n't all kidney-stone sufferers preparing to go to Munich ? Money ? Not necessarily . " For eight days in the hospital , I was billed $1,251 , " said Dr. Nicolette . " There was no charge at all from the physicians . I do n't know if this was due to the fact that I myself am a doctor or because it is an experimental program being subsidized by the makers of the machine . I was charged $350 for a kidney-function test as an outpatient . So my total cost was $1,600. plus air fare to and from Munich . " If money is n't the obstacle , then , why are the sidewalks of that Bavarian city not crowdedwith harborers of kidney stones ? " Your name will get around , and you 'll receive a lot of phone calls , " cautioned Dr. Chaussy and his colleagues to their first American patient . " But please do n't encourage anyone to come over here . " Reasons for this seemingly callous attitude are many . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone calls and pieces of mail every day from kidney-stone sufferers all over the world . Unfortunately , they are only able to treat eight patients a week . Only one prototype kidney-stone pulverizing apparatus exists , manufactured by a German engineering company . The research itself is underwritten by a grant from the West German government . Another machine is reportedly under construction . It will go to a researcher in Stuttgart , Germany . Why only in Germany ? Why not the United States and other countries ? When Dr. Chaussy came to the United States last spring , his lecture before the American Urological Society in Boston drew a large crowd of interested doctors . But the U.S. physicians talked in terms of a five-year test period for the device in the United States , an unnecessary delay in Dr. Chaussy 's opinion . He has been successfully pulverizing stones in human patients since June of 1979 and long before that in animals . Dr. Nicolette is one of the lucky few . Thousands of kidney-stone victims in the U.S. , some of whom are desperate , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath . " Yet , there is hope ! Take Gary Bauman of Des Moines , Iowa , a production planner for Firestone Tire and Rubber . He has suffered through seven or eight bouts with kidney stones . ( He 's lost count . ) " They are very painful , " he said . " I 've already had surgery three times . " Gary considers himself fortunate that he has never had to have a kidney removed . His latest visit to the surgeon last December resulted in a 12-inch incision from front to back . The operation removed the stones but also put him out of work for two months . His latest x-ray shows another stone beginning to form . Gary is one of a group of people who are especially prone to kidney-stone formation following intestinal bypass surgery for obesity . " Part of the problem with bypass patients is that oxalates derived from products such as soft drinks do not pass out of the intestinal tract as they would normally . There 's not enough calcium in the remaining intestines to bind these oxalates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm taking 150 mg of calcium carbonate a day to bind the oxalates , but it still does n't work for me . The quantity of oxalates is too great , I guess . " Gary now faces the prospect of reverse intestinal bypass surgery to save his kidneys . " I was very interested to hear about the procedure used in Germany , " he said . " I was hoping that it might buy me some time . " Jerry Ziemnicki , a 38-year-old investment banker from Houston , has an even more grim story to tell . Jerry 's first stone attack came in a restaurant in Milwaukee in February 1980 . " It was like someone beating my lower back with a ball bat , being punched in the stomach and kicked in the groin , so painful that I went outside to get some fresh air and did n't even realize that the temperature was 5 below zero , " he said . " When I had the dry heaves and passed blood in my urine , I knew I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible odyssey of pain and discomfort that lay ahead during the next year and a half . Several days after his first attack , doctors at a Milwaukee hospital diagnosed his problem  --  a 9 mm stone was blocking the right ureter . On the advice of two urologists , he underwent surgery which required an 11-inch incision , seven days in the hospital and ten days recuperation at his mother 's house in Milwaukee . On his way back to Houston , however , he believes he made a wrong move and tore some internal sutures . The solution in a Houston hospital was to insert a catheter from his kidney down through his bladder while the wound healed . He carried the catheter for six weeks . " I was hunched over and could n't straighten up , " he said . " It gave me devilish pain . People who saw me thought I was drugged . " The catheter was removed on May 1 , 1980 . In mid-June , Jerry , once an avid skier and sailor , decided to try a stretching exercise in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew again I had done something wrong . I lay on the bed for nearly an hour and could n't move for the pain . I kept getting worse , " Jerry said . " I was losing weight and had no appetite . I was going downhill fast . " On the advice of his Houston doctor , he visited his surgeon in Milwaukee . " You have a urinoma , a body cavity filled with urine , " he was told in Milwaukee . On the 10th of September , Jerry was operated on for the urinoma . The 20-minute procedure to drain the urinoma became an hour-and20-minute operation as two quarts of fluid were drained from his abdomen . The 11-inch incision was reopened and 210 internal stitches plus stainless steel staples were required to assure proper healing this time . After nine days in the hospital and three weeks of convalescence , Jerry returned to Houston . All went well until Christmas Eve , when he came down with what he thought was the flu , with a temperature of 105 . It was not the flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract infection . He was put on potent antibiotics . In mid-January his urologist again took x-rays to check the progress of his right kidney and ureter . It seemed to be healing properly , but something on the left side caught the attention of his doctor . Another stone was forming there . On May 1 , Jerry was back in the operating room . Doctors inserted a catheter to dilate his ureter , and he was given diuretics in hopes that the stone could be flushed out . The procedure failed . Instead , the stone had merely been pushed back up the ureter and into his kidney . He went home and took pain-killers . One week later , he had another three-hour siege of pain ; the stone had dropped out of the kidney and resumed its former position in the ureter . At present , Jerry is exercising and drinking 1 to 11/2 gallons of water a day , hoping that the stone will pass and that he can avoid further surgery . " I have a file folder , at least an inch-and-a-half thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have incurred about $12,000 in expenses covered by insurance and have paid an additional $2,300 from my own pocket . I was out of work for 15 weeks and lost about $30,000 in income during that time . " A former skiing partner of Jerry 's told him about a Saturday Evening Post article featuring Dr. Chaussy 's kidney-stone technique . Jerry contacted the German doctors but was told that they were trying to discourage people from coming there . They just did n't have the facilities to treat everyone . Both Gary Bauman and Jerry Ziemnicki have taken active positions in the Club , as have other stone formers who know firsthand the risks of kidney-stone surgery . " If I can prevent all this from happening to myself again or prevent it from happening to someone else , the efforts I spend with this Club will be well worth my while , " Jerry said . " Just compare what I went through with what happened to Dr. Nicolette . " With Jerry Ziemnicki 's permission we called his physician , Dr. Donald P. Griffith , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has a number of patients in far worse condition and in need of this procedure even more than Jerry , is going to Germany to look at the kidney-stone tank in Munich . These patients for whom he has a special concern have had one or more surgeries on each kidney already and are sure to have additional stones . Dr. Griffith 's interest in stones is all the more intense because , as he said , " I 've been working on kidney-stone prevention drugs for nine years and I feel as if I 'm beating my head against a wall . " It is difficult to interest pharmaceutical companies in spending the time and money necessary to get FDA approval on the drugs we need because the drugs wo n't reach a large enough market to warrant the high cost of the paper work necessary . We call these " orphan " drugs and the kidney-stone formers suffer . They need support to help get several // of these drugs approved . " I am going to Munich because I have a whole stable of patients that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have had recurring stones in those kidneys , " Dr. Griffith said . " And when you start operating the second or third time , you can lose a kidney . There 's mortality risk in these repeaters . " Dr. Griffith called us " a necessary consumer group for kidney-stone formers " and yes , he joined the Club . Before their next meeting , a committee of the Club will be investigating the work of a researcher in England who has reported that one-half as much calcium is excreted in the urine when an ounce of bran per day is consumed ( unprocessed bran , such as is available in most supermarkets or health-food stores ) . High urinary calcium levels are associated with kidney stones .
