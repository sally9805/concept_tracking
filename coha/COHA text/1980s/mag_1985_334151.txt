The trouble with the Democratic Party is that to many voters its national leadership appears to be no more than a collection of shrill special-interest groups . Just look at the way the Democratic National Committee has not merely tolerated but officially recognized seven different caucuses , representing business , women , blacks , Hispanics , Asian-Pacific delegates , " liberal- progressives " and even homosexuals . <P> That , at least , is the bitter complaint of some of the party 's prominent elected officials . Their solution ? To form another caucus , of course , this one composed primarily of Southern and Western white males and operating outside , if not in opposition to , the National Committee . <P> To be sure , that is not the official logic of the Governors , Senators and Representatives who have organized the Democratic Leadership Council . Their stated purpose " is to move the party back to the middle , " in the words of Florida Senator Lawton Chiles , by developing centrist policy positions . In their view the party must shed its ultraliberal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the voters who have been defecting and , in particular , if it is to enter future presidential elections without almost automatically forfeiting the electoral votes of Southern and Western states . To accomplish that , say council promoters , requires an organized group arguing within the party for positions favoring economic growth , a strong defense and a tough stance against crime . <P> One Democratic congressional staffer sympathetic to the council candidly calls it " an anticaucus caucus . " Many Democratic leaders sneer that the group is trying to cure the party 's excessive factionalism by introducing still more factionalism . " You ca n't rebuild something that is split by splitting it further , " says an official of the AFL-CIO , which suspects that the council is out to reduce labor 's influence in the party . South Carolina Senator Ernest Hollings calls the group " divisive and harmful . " Others suspect that the council is likely to become a vehicle for the 1988 presidential ambitions of some of its founders , notably Virginia Governor Charles Robb and Missouri Congressman Richard Gephardt . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFL-CIO officials warned that the labor federation might reduce its support of Democratic congressional candidates if the council was formed . Later , the 28- member California Democratic House delegation caucused and , says a participant , " virtually ordered " California Congressman Tony Coelho , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , to stay out of the group .
