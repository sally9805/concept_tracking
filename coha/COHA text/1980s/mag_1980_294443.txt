Grove City vs . Form 639A <P> Nestled in the rolling farm land of western Pennsylvania since 1876 , little Grove City College has never bothered anybody . Especially not the Government . Especially not about money . Like other institutions in the Christian College Coalition , G.C.C . is fiercely protective of its independence , both fiscal and spiritual . Dreading secular influence , the Presbyterian-affiliated school prides itself on never having taken a nickel from Washington , even in a time when private colleges get over a third of their operating budgets directly or indirectly from federal sources . Frugal Grove City provides its 2,200 students with a strong academic program , particularly notable in engineering and accounting , plus room and board , all for just $3,250 a year . <P> Grove City is fully coed , too , with equal facilities for women . So when the Department of Health , Education and Welfare sent along Form 639A ( Assurance of Compliance with Title IX ) to be filled out , Grove City 's President Charles MacKenzie ignored it . Since the Government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sexual discrimination , MacKenzie reasoned , the form did not apply . HEW did not agree . Its weapon , in cases of noncompliance , is to cut off Government funds . <P> While Grove City was getting no direct federal aid , its students were receiving some $618,000 a year total in individual loans and $110,000 in Basic Educational Opportunity Grants ( BEOG ) . Unless Form 639A was filled out and returned , warned HEW , the Government would cut off all that money . Given such a threat , Grove City College and four students sued to block the HEW action . <P> Last week G.C.C . won the case . Pittsburgh Federal District Court Judge Paul Simmons ruled that the loans are not Government aid to the college , since students ( or parents ) ultimately pay them back . As to BEOG money , while it does go to the college , Simmons ruled that the Government has no legal right to penalize individual students as " a remedy for coercing the college . " In perhaps the unkindest cut of all , Simmons declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be used to check up on Title IX compliance , said he , because it contains a passage about sexual discrimination in faculty hiring , though Title IX applies only to students . <P> G.C.C . staged a sinful victory celebration : an orgy of ice cream sundaes served to the entire student body . In Washington HEW declined to comment on the decision . HEW may or may not appeal . But the issue will be hotly contested if it ever winds up in court again , for the question of federal influence in U.S. colleges troubles academics as deeply as Title IX compliance concerns the Government . As for Form 639A , even though 19,500 completed copies are now sitting in HEW files , a new version will no doubt come rattling through some bureaucratic typewriter .
