The great toxic-waste mess oozed its way into the nation 's consciousness , and its conscience , a little more than five years ago . " An environmental emergency , " declared the Surgeon General in 1980 . " A ticking time bomb primed to go off , " warned the Environmental Protection Agency . The reaction was typically all-American : Congress created a grand-sounding " Superfund , " a $1.6 billion , five-year crash program designed to clean up thousands of leaking dumps that were threatening to contaminate much of the nation 's underground water supplies . <P> Last week that law expired , a victim of wrangling among the Senate , the House and President Reagan over how much more should be dedicated to the cause and who should pay the bill . During its existence , the Superfund dribbled away most of its money on a mismanaged effort that served only to reveal the almost unimaginable enormity of the task ahead . Though Congress is likely to reach an agreement by next month on a new infusion of money , anywhere from $10 billion over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Reagan Administration 's figure ) , for now the once ambitious program lingers in limbo . <P> Meanwhile , fears about toxic wastes continue to grow . Each day more and more communities discover that they are living near dumps or atop ground that has been contaminated by chemicals whose once strange names and initials  --  dioxin , vinyl chloride , PBB and PCB , as well as such familiar toxins as lead , mercury and arsenic  --  have become household synonyms for mysterious and deadly poisons . " The problem is worse than it was five years ago , " contends New Jersey Democrat James Florio , who as a Congressman from one of the most seriously contaminated states became the key author of the 1980 Superfund law . " It 's much , much greater than anyone thought . " Concedes Lee Thomas , the third director of the scandal-tarnished EPA during the Reagan Administration : " We have a far bigger problem than we thought when Superfund was enacted . There are far more sites that are far more difficult to deal with than anybody ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commoner , the venerable environmental gadfly . Says he : " We are poisoning ourselves and our posterity . " <P> The growing awareness of the vast scope of the toxic-waste problem has bred much public anguish but precious little remedial action . The Office of Technology Assessment , a research arm of Congress , contends that there may be at least 10,000 hazardous-waste sites in the U.S. that pose a serious threat to public health and that should be given priority in any national cleanup . The cost , OTA estimates , could easily reach $100 billion , or more than $1,000 per U.S. household . Eventually , predicts the General Acccounting Office , which also does studies for Congress , more than 378,000 waste sites may require corrective action . So far the EPA has put only 850 dumps on its priority list ( see map ) . In its five-year effort , it managed to clean up only six sites and , critics protest , not very thoroughly at that .                  @ @ @
