Games and sports are usually symbolic of something deeper . Bullfighting portrays the fascination with death . High jumping is the symbolic quest for freedom . Football has something to do with sex . Basketball has something to do with sex . Soccer has something to do with sex . Baseball , however , is a metaphor for eating . Why else would a slow game played on hot days by tobacco juice droolers remain so popular ? Generation after generation goes to the ballpark to be reminded of food . Consider . The central objects of the game are a pitcher , batter and a plate . Pitchers feed fat ones , or throw forkballs that jam batters or eat them alive . A crop of rookies is grown on a farm team . An easy fly ball is a can of corn . An argument is a rhubarb . Hot dogs do taste better at the park because the fans are at a symbolic nine-course meal . In honor of the National Repast Time , the moment is right for the game ' s first culinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of great competition to make the team , the first team is based on last names , the second team on first names , the oldtimers on either and the farm team on whimsy .

Pitchers : Preacher Roe , Dizzy Trout . DH : Tony Oliva ( olive in Spanish ) . The players , naturally , were thrilled at being named to the team . " What ? I don ' t concern myself with junk like that , " said Lemon after a recent Boston- Detroit game , apparently thinking he was named to the junk food team . Rice , in the other locker room , was also excited . His statement was difficult to hear but went something like " Don ' t talk to me in the shower . " Players first names made them eligible for the second team . Nicknames had to be commonly used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second team : Outfield : Ducky Medwick , Goose Goslin , Candy Maldonado .

As the All-Food team was being prepared , a woman who watches an occasional game happened by and inquired , " What about Joe Pepperoni ? " What about Pepperoni , indeed . She was making the point that many players are blessed with monikers that are either similar to food names or just sound gastronomical . We will allow this group to make up the farm team roster . It includes : Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill Almon , Tim Hamm , Steve Brye , George Crowe , Sam Mele , Don Gullet , Eddie Mayo , Bernie Carbo , Danny Cater , Duke Carmel , Nick Goulish and the immortal George Burpo .
