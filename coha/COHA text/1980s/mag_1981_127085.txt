Now it 's 10 to 20 yards and a clod of AstroTurf , and scoreboards are aglow with points . In five games last week Big Ten teams scored a total of 307 points and completed 179 of 360 passes for 2,331 yards . The turnaround has been so pronounced that the Big Ten leads the nation 's conferences in passing yardage with an average of 197.9 a game per team . // Perhaps the best indication to date that throwing the ball in the Big Ten is no mere passing fancy came last week as Minnesota stunned visiting Ohio State 35-31 . Altogether , 100 passes were unleashed . The Gophers ' Mike Hohensee , a junior college transfer from California , threw a school-record 67 of them . He also set Minnesota marks for completions ( 37 ) and passing yardage ( 444 ) . The Gophers , who trailed 21-7 at the half and 31-21 in the fourth period , pulled out the game when Hohensee fired his fourth and fifth touchdown passes . Both were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier grabbed another TD pass . Minnesota Coach Joe Salem admitted that Carroll 's scoring plays were designed to get the fullback open . But Salem did n't mind at all that Hohensee hit Carroll instead on passes covering 27 , 18 and 28 yards , the last with 2:38 left . // Illinois led Michigan 21-7 at the end of the opening quarter and was driving early in the second period . A blowout appeared imminent . It was : Michigan won 70-21 . Defensive Halfback Jerry Burgei 's end-zone interception thwarted the Illini 's second-period thrust , and from there on the game belonged to the Wolverines . Michigan Quarterback Steve Smith ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more , two of them scored by Anthony Carter . // Iowa ended a two-game slide with its first victory over Purdue since 1960 . The Hawk-eyes won 33-7 by more or less corraling Boilermaker Quarterback Scott Campbell and Wide Receiver Steve Bryant . Campbell , who entered the game leading the nation in passing efficiency , completed 21 of 41 passes for 211 yards . Bryant , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catches , was held to one reception . Gordy Bohannon , operating out of Iowa 's new shotgun spread , which deploys two tight ends , passed for 136 yards and scored on runs of 12 and seven yards . " Twenty cotton-pickin ' years ! " shouted Iowa Coach Hayden Fry after the game . " The players are doing the hokey-pokey. " // Another happy coach was Wisconsin 's Dave McClain . The Badgers ' 28-7 win at Indiana gave McClain his first victory in the Hoosier state since he left Ball State in 1978 to take his current job . Jess Cole , who passed for a touchdown in the first half , scored on a seven-yard run in the third period and collaborated with Split End Michael Jones on a 56-yard touchdown pass-run in the fourth . David Greenwood 's 65-yard return of an interception cemented the victory for the Badgers , who are tied with Michigan for first place in the Big Ten , a game up on Ohio State and Iowa . Michigan State 's game with Northwestern produced 39 total completed passes and 476 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Notre Dame-Georgia Tech game , but the Irish got most of the yardage and an easy 35-3 win . The Yellow Jackets gained only 134 yards through the air , while the Irish picked up 253 . Freshman Tailback Robert LeVette tied a Tech record with 14 catches , but they were good for only 50 yards . Another freshman , 5 ' 7 " , 163-pound Split End Joe ( Small Wonder ) Howard of Notre Dame , hooked up with Quarterback Blair Kiel on pass-runs covering 96 and 58 yards . // Oklahoma trailed 14-0 at Kansas State before the Sooners even got off a play . The Wildcats drove 80 yards for a touchdown in the game 's first offensive series and then , after recovering the ensuing onside kick , put together a six-play drive for another score . Kansas State increased its lead to 21-0 early in the second period by converting a Sooner fumble into a TD . Freshman Halfback Alvin Ross made the score 21-6 with a four-yard run just before halftime , but Oklahoma missed the extra-point kick . The Sooners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nullified a touchdown , a first down at the Wildcat 12 was missed by inches and a fumble was lost at the Kansas State two . A 12-yard run by Ross and a two-point conversion run closed the gap to 21-14 as the final quarter began . From there on Oklahoma Quarterback Darrell Shepard was in charge . He ran 20 yards to pull the Sooners to within one but missed on a two-point pass try with 6:47 remaining . Then , after a short quick kick by the Wildcats on third-and-18 , Shepard took the Sooners 60 yards in four plays . He dashed the last 49 for the go-ahead points with 2:31 to play . A two-point run by Shepard completed Oklahoma 's 28-21 comeback . // Kansas did better , surprising Iowa State 24-11 in Ames . Frank Seurer bedeviled the Cyclones by passing for one touchdown and running for another . He completed 12 of 18 for 132 yards and ran for 101 yards . // Like Oklahoma , Oklahoma State fell behind quickly : 17-0 to Nebraska after one period . Unlike the Sooners , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54-7 . The Oklahoma State defense , second in the nation with an average yield of only 216 yards a game , was torn apart by the Cornhuskers , who gained 546 yards . I-Backs Roger Craig ( 121 yards , including a 69-yard scoring run ) and Mike Rozier ( 102 yards plus a 93-yard kickoff return for a touchdown ) did much of the damage . The Cowboys committed seven turnovers , but had the distinction of scoring the first touchdown Nebraska 's defense had allowed in six games . // Missouri came from 14 points back to knock off Colorado 30-14 and end a three-game losing streak. // In the second half , Central Michigan ran 57 plays and held Miami of Ohio to 15 yards on 13 plays but still lost 7-3 . The Redskins took over second place in the Mid-American Conference by stopping Central five times within their 11 . Miami 's victory enabled Toledo , a 28-14 victor over Western Michigan , to climb to first . // WEST // When Steve Brown returned a kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown to give Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They dreaded that the Cougars , who the week before had lost their first game of the season , at USC , would collapse as they so often had in recent years . The fans need n't have fretted . Four second-half touchdowns  --  two by Fullback Robert Williams on runs of 22 and 12 yards  --  enabled Washington State to cruise to a 39-7 victory . // Stanford backers reveled in a 63-9 romp at Oregon State . The Cardinals , one of the season 's biggest flops , gained 439 yards on the ground and 245 through the air as they ended a three-game losing streak . Quarterback John Elway ( page 54 ) accounted for all the aerial yardage . Stanford 's other superb offensive weapon , senior Wide Receiver Darrin Nelson , ran 19 times for 190 yards , caught seven passes for 107 yards and broke a school record by scoring five touchdowns . Nelson 's TDs came on a 53-yard pass play and on runs ranging from one to 80 yards . Nelson , who has gained 6,538 yards running , receiving and returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCAA career mark . // Southern Cal 's Marcus Allen broke another of Dorsett 's NCAA records by increasing his season rushing yardage to 1,968 in a 21-3 victory over Cal . Allen gained 243 on 46 carries and scored three touchdowns despite practicing only twice last week because of a sprained ankle . The triumph enabled the Trojans to move into a tie with Arizona State for the Pac-10 lead , a half game ahead of Washington State and UCLA. // " Just because they 're in the Pacific Coast Athletic Association , people malign them , " said Arizona State Coach Darryl Rogers after the Sun Devils held off San Jose State 31-24 . " They are better than most teams in the Pac-10 . We knew the game would be like this . " The score was 24-24 with 5:12 left when Arizona State 's Mike Pagel threw a desperation pass on a third-down play . Wide Receiver Doug Allen made a leaping grab in the end zone to complete the Sun Devils ' resurgence from a 24-17 third-period deficit . Pagel completed 20 of 42 throws for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air as Steve Clarkson hit on 25 of 53 passes , two of them for touchdowns. // UCLA scored all its points in second-and third-period sprees en route to a 31-0 win over Washington , which had n't been shut out since 1976 . The two scoring spurts , which lasted a total of only 4:50 , were set up by an interception and the recovery of four fumbles. // Jim McMahon of Brigham Young did n't merely have a couple of hot moments ; he kept firing until the final three minutes of a 63-14 rout of Colorado State . Coach LaVell Edwards left McMahon in the game to give him a shot at the NCAA single-game record for pass completions . McMahon got it by completing 44 of 65 passes for seven touchdowns . He also established three NCAA career records : 8,897 yards in total offense , surpassing the record set last year by Purdue 's Mark Herrmann ; touchdowns responsible for ( 90 ) ; and points responsible for ( 540 ) . The last two records had belonged to Tennessee State 's Joe Adams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1977 through 1980. // BYU 's win set up this week 's showdown for WAC supremacy between the Cougars and Hawaii . The Rainbow Warriors won their 11th straight by routing Texas-El Paso 35-7 with 566 yards in total offense . Hawaii tailbacks excelled . Anthony Edgar , who scored on runs of 82 and 47 yards , rushed for 153 yards . Gary Allen ran for 71 and scored three times , once on a 62-yard pass . // New Mexico held visiting Utah to a 7-7 standoff . The Lobos earned the tie when Robin Gabriel , the son of former pro Quarterback Roman Gabriel , passed for 59 of his 71 yards during a fourth-quarter scoring drive . // San Diego State , which began the season with four victories , lost for the fourth straight time . Wyoming converted an interception and a fumble recovery into second-quarter touchdowns to go in front 14-0 , and ultimately won 24-15 . All of which left Hawaii 5-0 atop the WAC , followed by Utah at 4-0-1 and Wyoming and BYU , both 5-1. // SOUTH // " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-dimension back . I can do more than just run the ball . " So said Georgia 's Herschel Walker , who had to be multidimensional indeed for the Dogs to defeat Florida 26-21 . The Gators had a 14-0 lead late in the second quarter . Then Walker showed his stuff , teaming with Buck Belue on a 24-yard touchdown pass 31 seconds before halftime . Those two clicked again on a 16-yarder that tied the game at 14 in the third period . Walker 's four-yard run in the fourth quarter put Georgia in front , but the Bulldogs ' errant PAT left the door open for Florida , which went on top 21-20 when Wayne Peace hit Spencer Jackson with a 10-yard pass . So it was back to work for Walker , who culminated a 95-yard , 18-play drive with a one-yard leap into the end zone with 2:31 left . The Gators , who had been yielding just 120 yards a game on the ground , found out how destructive Walker could be : He ran for 192 yards on 47 carries . // Dana Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-0 lead over Southern Mississippi in a non-conference game . A crowd of 64,112 , the largest ever to see a sporting event in the state , showed up in Jackson and watched the Golden Eagles pull out a 7-6 victory after recovering a fumble at the Bulldog 14 in the second period . Sammy Winder needed just three carries to reach the end zone , which he did on a one-yard run . // Miami won its second straight Sunshine State title with a 27-19 defeat of Florida State . The Hurricanes , who beat Florida earlier in the year , trailed 13-10 before Danny Miller kicked a 57-yard field goal . Halfback Smokey Roan put Miami in front on a six-yard touchdown run . Jim Kelly then passed 23 yards to Fullback Speedy Neal for the clincher. // " If you 're going to be a good team , you have to get points from your defense and specialty teams , " said Penn State Coach Joe Paterno after the Nittany Lions had won 22-15 at North Carolina State . Penn State 's specialists did just that . Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Corner-back Giuseppe Harris blocked a punt for a safety . In between came the most dazzling play of all  --  a fake punt . Instead of the ball being snapped to Kicker Ralph Giacomarro , it went to Ken Kelley , a former high school quarterback who was the upback . Kelley passed five yards to Harry Hamilton , who ran 46 more for a TD . The Nittany Lions needed all that help from their specialty teams because their leading ground-gainer , Curt Warner , was out with a pulled hamstring . // Tailback Mike Grayson ran for 188 yards on 17 carries and threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to lift Duke past Wake Forest 31-10 in an ACC game . Meanwhile , Clemson took over first place in the conference by edging North Carolina 10-8 ( page 40 ) . // Tailback Larry Fourqurean gained 245 yards on 32 carries as Marshall defeated Appalachian State 17-10 . The victory was the Thundering Herd 's first Southern Conference win in 27 attempts . // Pacific pulled off one of the week 's biggest shockers by beating South Carolina 23-21. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Pitt ? Would the Panthers , trailing Rutgers 3-0 late in the second period at New Jersey 's Meadowlands , become the sixth No. 1-ranked squad to fall this season ? No way . Two touchdown passes by Dan Marino put Pitt in front 14-3 at the intermission . Marino then sneaked one yard for a score in the third quarter , passed for another in the fourth and finished with 18 of 28 for 239 yards . The Panthers picked up 315 yards on the ground and came out on top 47-3 . Tailback Bryan Thomas , who rushed for 168 yards and one TD , also caught five passes . // That was n't the Seventh Fleet that beat Syracuse 35-23 . It was Senior Tailback Eddie Meyers , who broke his own Navy single-game rushing record by running for 298 yards , the most anyone had ever gained against the Orange . Meyers thereby also set a Middie career rushing record , boosting his total to 2,620 yards . Against Syracuse he scored four times , on jaunts of 10 , 32 , five and 78 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards for touchdowns and wound up with 162 yards rushing against Holy Cross before leaving the game in the third quarter with bruised ribs . But Walker was n't enough ; the Crusaders erased a 13-0 Cadet lead and won 28-13. // West Virginia overcame Temple 's 10-0 first-quarter lead to prevail 24-19 . Jim Brown of the Owls ran for 178 yards , and Oliver Luck of the Mountaineers passed for 234. // Yale , too , had to scramble to avoid losing . The Elis were down 17-7 at the start of the final period at Cornell . What 's more , Yale Quarterback John Rogan had been sidelined with an injured right elbow . Two poor punts , a lost fumble and a deliberate safety by the Red Raiders enabled the Elis to gain a 23-17 win and remain undefeated . The decisive points came with 53 seconds to play when Joe Dufek , Rogan 's replacement , hit Wide Receiver Curtis Grieve with a 16-yard touchdown pass . It was Grieve 's 10th TD reception of the season . Dartmouth defeated Columbia 21-7 in the only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed for three touchdowns and ran for two , but Maine rallied from a 28-14 deficit to win 55-44 . Delaware routed winless Penn 40-6 . Brown won 10-8 at Rhode Island , and Harvard beat William &amp; Mary 23-14. // Widener ( Pa. ) , the No. 1 Division III team , coasted past Ursinus 43-14 for its 34th straight regular-season victory . // SOUTHWEST // " I thought we 'd have to give the kickoff teams mouth-to-mouth resuscitation , " said Arkansas Coach Lou Holtz after a breathtaking 41-39 victory over Baylor in Little Rock . Jay Jeffrey of the Bears was on target with 17 of 26 passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns . Two of those scoring throws were hauled in by Split End Gerald McNeil , who caught 10 passes altogether for a school-record 197 yards . Fullback Dennis Gentry put Baylor ahead 39-38 with 2:05 to go by grabbing Jeffrey 's nine-yard toss on fourth down . But for the second time in the final period , the Bears failed on a two-point conversion . Freshman Quarterback Brad Taylor then took the Razorbacks 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passes during the drive , Taylor wound up hitting on 17 of 23 throws for 250 yards . Fullback Jessie Clark , who tied the Arkansas single-game touchdown record with five scoring runs , did n't get a chance to wrap up the final march . That opportunity went to Bruce Lahay , who earlier in the game had booted a 49-yard field goal . This time , with 12 seconds remaining , Lahay kicked a 27-yarder that put the local fans in Hog heaven . // There was no such joy in Houston , where Texas , which trailed 14-0 at halftime , salvaged a 14-14 deadlock . Robert Brewer , who took over at quarterback for the Longhorns after Rick McIvor injured his right shoulder shortly before halftime , was instrumental in dashing Houston 's hopes for an upset . Brewer completed three passes for 38 yards during an 80-yard fourth-quarter drive that ended when John Walker ran eight yards for a touchdown . That score , plus Walker 's grab of Brewer 's PAT pass , cut Houston 's advantage to 14-11 . Then with 3:27 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field goal in the third period , added a 47-yarder. // Despite four turnovers and 14 penalties , SMU defeated Rice 33-12 . The Mustangs rolled up 513 yards in total offense , with tailbacks Eric Dickerson and Craig James accounting for a total of 347 . Dickerson ran for 186 yards on 26 carries and scored his 18th TD of the season on a 58-yard sprint . James , who carried 20 times , gained 161 yards . // For Texas Christian , its game at Texas Tech seemed to drag on longer than a performance of Nicholas Nickleby . After three periods the Horned Frogs were behind 32-15 . Then came the final act : three TCU touchdowns and a safety caused by Linebacker Mike Dry , the son of Coach FA . Dry , who blocked a punt out of the end zone with 1:31 to go . When the curtain came down , the score was 39-39.
