txt MILLIONAIRE BUILDER Edivard J. DeBartolo Sr. probably will be wearing a smile when he sits down to his Christmas dinner . But his good spirits may be motivated by more than yuletide fervor . Although this is supposed to be the season when love and charity dominate , there might also be a dash of vindication spicing DeBartolo 's cranberry sauce . A year after the wealthy Youngstown , Ohio , shopping center developer suffered the worst humffiation of his life , his professional sports interests are doing exceptionally well . The rancor he must have felt when the American League owners rejected his $20 million bid to buy the Chicago White Sox should by now have turned to sweet revenge . HIS FAMILY 'S San Francisco 49ers ended the season with the best record of any professional football team ? 13 wins and 3 losses . His other sports holdings  --  the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team and the Pittsburgh Spirit indoor soccer team ? also are doing well . And there are recurring reports that . his prime antagonist in the aborted White Vernon Jarrett Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ieould be on his way out . So as the turkey fat sizzles in the oven and DeBartolo savors a chilled goblet of Italian red wine , how sweet it will he for him to contemplate the events of 1991 . It was just a little more than a year ago , Dec. 11 , 1490 , that DeBartolo got the . word that his offer to purchase the White Sdx had beearturned down by the American League . No official reason has ever peen glen for the rejection . There were rumors aplenty , the kind a man ca n't fight and should n't risk dig'nifying with a response . The people who had successfully . shot down DeBartolo had demeaned only themselves . However , that reality must have done little to ease the pain of being rejected by a bunch of people not worthy of holding DeBartolo 's coat , much less filling his highly successful shoes . A SON OF Immigrant parents , DeBartolo bad mastered a stone mason 's tools before becoming one of America 's most successful real estate tycoons . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian heritage . He was the master or a nusmess empire worth an estimated half-billion dol. lars . Despite the penchant of some to taint persons of Mediterranean origin with the black hand of the Mafia , no one had ever laid a glove on DeBartolo 's personal or professional reputation . His credentials were impeccable . Nevertheless , on that wintry Dallas day , DeBartolo was deemed unfit to sit with the likes of George Stelabrenner . At the time , there was speculation that a major , reason for turning down DeBartolo was fear of the competition him intended investments in a White Sox renaissance might produce . From the looks of It , those fears probably were well grounded . The DeBartolo family has done exactly that with the San Francisco 49ers sprit the kind of money necessary to hire the talented leadership that creates a winning ball team . IIAD DEBARTOLO BEEN permitted to work the same miracle in Chicago , White Sox fans probably would n't be again sucking their thumbs in ' frustrated indignation . Think of the major successes that have been wrought since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. , now 34 years old and still the youngest owner in the league . With wisdom and the money to back it , the DeBartolo clan brought In Bill Walsh , who is acclaimed as the best NFL coach in the country and is a leading contender for professional football 's coach of the year . They also acquired Notre Dame 's Joe " Big Sky " Montana , a quarterback as strong-armed as a Chicago mugger . And the DeBartolos proved again that indisputable fact that one of the best ways to build a winning team in any sport is to spend a big buck to achieve the competence and courage that scores touchdowns or home runs . THUS , ON THIS Christmas Day , as DeBartolo gathers with his family around the table in Youngstown , every bite of the turkey should be as satisfying as his knowledge that commissioner Kuhn probably is eating crow . The Frisco 49ers are in the Super Bowl playb.offs . Kuhn might soon be looking for a jo And , perhaps sweetest of all , DeBartolo still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Sox , 20 million bucks that have been earning 1081 's record high interest rates . That 's money he made without blowing a dime in Chicago . So it 's your gain , Mr. DeBartolo . And our ' loss . And a Merry . Christmas to all
