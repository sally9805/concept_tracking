No one knows when or how the war between Iran and Iraq will end , because the motives and deliberations of both belligerents are hidden from the rest of the world . What the rest of the world can be sure of is that the conflict could have severe consequences . Thus , prudence would seem to dictate that the West should immediately take concrete steps designed to manage the war ' s possible impact on world-oil supplies . So far , the United States ' complacency about the possible impact of the conflict has seemed justified . After all , there is what people call a global oil " glut . " But oil inventories must be put into perspective . Worldwide stocks currently are estimated to be 5.3 billion barrels , or about 10 percent higher than normal . As an insurance policy , that figure is not very reassuring since it represents perhaps an extra 10 days of free world consumption . Still , the entire world supply is not jeopardized by the Iranian-Iraq war . What is at stake then is the ability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude and length - and of very considerable danger . Let us consider three scenarios : 1 ) The war ends within a few days . There would then be no significant impact on oil supplies , although the world market will probably be left even more jittery than usual . 2 ) Iraqi and Iranian exports - combined they total about 4 million barrels a day - cease for weeks or even months . If all other producers remain constant , including Saudi Arabia at 9.5 million barrels a day , it would take more than half a year to whittle down the current world inventories to a normal level . And if other producers increased output , even more time would be bought . 3 ) Passage through the Strait of Hormuz - only exit from the Persian Gulf - drops precipitously or ceases altogether , whether because of military action , fear on the part of other producers , or the unwillingness of tanker insurers to provide coverage . The free world would then lose between 17 and 18 million barrels of oil a day - more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirds of the oil in world trade . Today ' s stocks would provide about a month extra cushion in that case . If the world were a calm place , the storm - at least for a while - could be weathered . Unfortunately , though , even scenario 2 could initiate a panic leading to another bruising scramble for oil on the world market and , therefore , much higher prices . Worse , that scenario could escalate into the third sequence , which would look pretty much like one of the apocalypse scenarios that have been giving energy planners nightmares since 1973 . At the very least , prices would go up very swiftly . But the war ' s consequences could go well beyond price increases . The stability of other governments in the gulf region could be undermined by the conflict , and the global balance of power could be affected . Thus , decisive defensive steps should be taken immediately . The United States and the other Western governments should put full weight behind the International Energy Agency to coordinate policies that will restrain consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little- noted action last week , the IEA governing board in Paris took important steps . It agreed that member governments should urge oil companies not to engage in practices that drive up prices and to begin to develop policies for inventory drawdowns . Emergency exemptions from US antitrust laws - with appropriate safeguards - should be provided to the oil companies so that they can talk to each other , balance supplies and offset the competitive bidding that could result from corporate insecurity and inadequate information . Such interchanges would be much less costly to the consumer than $55- or $60-a-barrel oil , and in fact would allow the companies to respond more smoothly to those nations deprived of supplies . Such immediate firm domestic action could do a lot to counter panic buying on the spot market . No speculator wants to be caught buying oil at high prices that he can not sell quickly at higher prices . Fuel switching - especially substituting natural gas for oil - would help . But the most important target is gasoline . About one of every eight barrels of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American highway . Congress approved an emergency rationing program in July . Unfortunately , implementation could be extraordinarily cumbersome and perhaps chaotic , and could take a year or more to achieve . What will be most effective is the gas tax , perhaps imposed only for the duration of the crisis . Finally , dangerous myths must be put aside . We are told that the United States is not directly affected by the current conflict , that we import only a small amount of oil from Iraq , and none from Iran . True , but irrelevant and misleading . At the time of the shah ' s fall , in early 1979 , we were told much the same thing . Such an assertion was as dangerous then as now . Today we are paying the world price of more than $30 a barrel along with everybody else . The point is that it is a world market , and once competitive bidding begins , all oil is up for grabs . Indeed , countries like France and India and Brazil are already shopping around for oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have lost because of the conflict . If America acts on the premise that it is not directly affected , then we are likely to end up paying a great deal more for every barrel .
