There comes a time when newspapers , so relentless in pursuit of wrongdoers in government , find that they have wrongdoers on their own staffs . It can happen anywhere ; what matters is what the newspaper then does about it : Does it hush up the story , or go all out to report it ? <P> In times past , any scandal reflecting on a newspaper might have been acknowledged briefly , if at all , back among the truss ads . But the best papers have learned from Watergate a lesson that officeholders in government are still learning : any attempt to cover up or to play down a scandal is apt to worsen it . <P> Just three years ago this month , the Washington Post had to admit that its Pulitzer prize-winning story by Janet Cooke about an eight-year-old heroin addict was a hoax . The scandal shocked editors of the Wall Street Journal , which put a squad of reporters onto the story and emerged with a tough front-page report ( " Lessons for All Journalists " ) . <P> It appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughgoing inquiry by its ombudsman ( an independent critic ) , who judged the Post 's performance " inexcusable . " The Post admitted to squelching its own doubts when Cooke 's story was first challenged . One of her superiors , Bob Woodward , reportorial hero of Watergate , said , " We went into our Watergate mode-protect the source and back the reporter . " <P> Now it is the Wall Street Journal 's time for scandal ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) . The Securities and Exchange Commission tipped off the paper that it was investigating handsome profits being made by investors who had advance knowledge of items written by R. Foster Winans , 35 , that would appear in the Journal 's widely read " Heard on the Street " column . <P> Determined to be first and fullest in reporting its own embarrassing story , the Journal assigned seven or eight reporters to it . Warren H. Phillips , the Journal 's chairman and chief executive , said , " Our news management told them to cover it as they would any other company or paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-page story that resulted made melancholy reading , but was commendable for its candor . Winans may not have profited from the leaks , but a free-spending colleague , David J. Carpenter , who worked at the Journal for 18 months , might have . The Journal report was remarkably blunt : " The two are lovers . . . They live together , and Mr. Winans wears a gold ring given to him by Mr. Carpenter . " <P> Journal editors were sufficiently concerned about the homosexual reference to try out another version of the story on colleagues , identifying Winans ' companion this time as a female lover or spouse , just to see whether the relationship had been overstressed simply because homosexuality was involved . The editors concluded that the homosexuality had to be printed . <P> Besides , how would the Journal have looked later had another paper come out with " the real , untold story " ?
