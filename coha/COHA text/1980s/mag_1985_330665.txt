A major opera premiere may draw international critical attention , but the real action in new music is found on the local front . After all , many more U.S. cities have orchestras than have opera companies , and the average music lover 's exposure to contemporary music comes most often in the concert hall . A cluster of new works performed around the country this past month shows that a stylistic eclecticism is the rage in composition these days , with composers paying homage to sources as disparate as James Joyce , J.S. Bach , the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge . <P> Coincidentally , two pieces inspired by Joyce 's last novel , Finnegans Wake , were premiered a week apart and had practically the same name . Toru Takemitsu 's rippling Riverrun ( 1984 ) was given its first performance by Pianist Peter Serkin and the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Conductor Simon Rattle . Stephen Albert 's ambitious RiverRun debuted at the Kennedy Center in Washington , under Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich with the National Symphony . In Manhattan , Violinist Gidon Kremer played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offertorium with the New York Philharmonic , while across the East River , the Brooklyn Philharmonic presented the first indoor performance of Tobias Picker 's frisky Keys to the City , written in 1983 to celebrate the Brooklyn Bridge 's centenary . And Pittsburgh got the first hearing of Ned Rorem 's rawboned An American Oratorio , performed by the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Mendelssohn Choir . <P> Of the five , Albert 's 40-minute , four-movement symphony was the best , as much for what it represented as for its considerable technical accomplishment . A frank invocation of the spirits of Mahler , Stravinsky and Sibelius in its late romantic thematic materials , its grandiose orchestration and its heroic reach , RiverRun would probably have been laughed off the stage 20 years ago by Albert 's colleagues as impossibly regressive . If anything , the grand-gestured RiverRun is not enough of a throwback , bashfully pulling back at crucial moments as though Albert , 43 , did not fully trust his expansive instincts . The conservative spirit is scarcely limited to politics these days , and younger composers like Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandfathers . <P> On the other hand , the concerto by Takemitsu , 54 , is a delicate , elusive short piece in one movement that is more obviously Joycean in its free-flowing play of ideas . Hardly a bravura technical display , it is instead restrained ; if Albert 's River Liffey is sometimes a raging torrent , Takemitsu 's is a gentle stream . <P> Gubaidulina 's Offertorium ( 1979-80 ) uses the theme of Bach 's Musical Offering as the takeoff point for a complex violin concerto that lasts about 35 minutes . Atonal passages mingle freely with tonal ones as the theme is atomized and then reconstructed in reverse ; the modern orchestrational device of flutter-tonguing for flutes and brass is complemented by traditionally virtuosic writing for the solo violinist . Gubaidulina , 53 , also evokes her Russian predecessors Stravinsky and Prokofiev , most strikingly in a passage of glissandi string harmonics that recalls The Firebird . By Western standards , Offertorium may be tame , but given the governmental restrictions on the stylistic range of Soviet music , it shows Gubaidulina to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
