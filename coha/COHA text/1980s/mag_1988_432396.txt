 | Jackson would have liked Kenneth G. Wilson . Amid the chorus of complaints about the ongoing decline of American youth , as judged by their awful spelling habits , Wilson 's is a voice of reason and subtler wisdom . Returning to teaching English at the University of Connecticut after 20 years in administration , he found student skills just as bad as always , but the level of lamentation worse , and he began a crusade to put things into proper perspective . " I happen to be a good speller , but that 's the way I was born . It 's nothing to boast about , " Wilson says . " Spelling is a basic , neuromuscular ability ? a kind of eye-hand coordination , like hitting a golf ball . It 's nothing to feel guilty about . It 's not a matter of morality . " What , then , is it a matter of ? There are as many theories as there are spellings of medieval . One well-accepted notion holds that poor spellers have a mild form of dyslexia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't re-create the words they see . Another school of thought blames the English language itself , that orthographic melting pot which has mixed so many different traditions that phonetic rules scarcely apply . George Bernard Shaw asked sarcastically why " fish " was n't spelled " ghoti " ? using the gh from " enough , " the o from " women , " the ti from " nation . " English is also a moving target ; the blasted language keeps changing . As late as 1986 some U.S. Supreme Court justices were spelling " marijuana " with an h instead of a j , and sometimes using both in the same sentence . Whatever the underlying factors , there is a growing awareness ? in research , if not in corporate hiring circles ? that the ability to spell has little to do with basic intelligence . Nor does it correlate with writing ability . F. Scott Fitzgerald was a notoriously bad speller . His longtime editor , Max Perkins , was not much better , or at least was not one to wield a mighty red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise " contained approximately 100 " mispellings " as Fitzgerald griped in a letter to Perkins . In another infamous " Dear Max " letter , Fitzgerald recommended a promising author , " a young man named Ernest Hemmingway , " and noted that " Ezra Pount " had published a collection of his short stories . Hemingway was abysmal in his own right , routinely writing " apoligize , " and " responsability , " and retaining the final " e " when adding suffixes ? as in " loveing . " He seemed to take a perverse pleasure in the eccentricity . " The spelling and construction of my letters is careless rather than ignorant , " he explained in 1952 . Perpetrating howlers : Charles Scribner III , a senior editor at Scribner 's and a Macmillan Publishing Co. vice president , theorizes that Fitzgerald , besides being simply sloppy , wrote with his ear , whereas other writers tend to be visually oriented . " It was the sound of the words that mattered to him . " Scribner says , " and he expected other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most editors accept that responsibility ; " they 're not paid to be poets , " he says . though there have been cases where publishers themselves perpetrated howlers . One young Scribner 's editor , for example . failed to notice that Edmund Wilson 's name was spelled " Edmond " on the cover ofa 1976 paperback edition of " Axel 's Castle , " a volume of literary criticism . " The young editor got a stern reprimand , " Scribner says . " But I 'm glad to say he was n't fired ? otherwise I would n't be here . " The science behind spelling problems is just as complex as the language itself . Researchers at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston have examined the brains of deceased dyslexics and found measurable differences  | that trace back to prenatal development . But scientists are still a long way from understanding how the biology translates into reading disorders , and there is far less research on how spelling fits in . " Almost all poor readers also have problems spelling , but the reverse is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neurology at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem , N.C. " There is absolutely something different about the way their brains process language information . But we do n't know how hard-wired that is . " Visual memory : Aylett Cox , who has worked with severely dyslexic children in Dallas for many years , has one possible explanation . " People have photographic memories for words on a spectrum , " she says . " Those at the high end of the spectrum can remember how a word looks and spell it right , as if it 's printed across their forehead . Those at the bottom end are dyslexic . They may have to see a word 500 to 1,500 times before they remember it . " Dyslexics tend to have a poor aptitude for abstract two-dimensional symbols , like letters , Cox says , and need tools to help make up for their lack of visual memory . She advocates teaching phonics ( sound-symbol relationships ) and contends that 85 percent of the most commonly used English words do follow reliable phonetic rules . Scientists believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right brain governs more creative three-dimensional skills such as art , music and mechanical ability . Much dyslexia research has focused on how those hemi- spheres relate to each other . " The very children who have trouble with spelling are often those who have talent in those other areas , " Cox says , which may help explain why some great creative writers ca n't line up their letters correctly . Given the complex neurological patterns involved , many researchers say the simplest remedy for poor spelling is a word processor with a good spell-checking program . Such gizmos are fast becoming the boon for the orthographically impaired that calculators have been for math dolts . A common frustration with such programs is that they do n't flag correctly spelled words used out of context , such as " to , " " too " and " two . " But software writers are working on remedying that in the next generation , as the technology incorporates more artificial intelligence . Rather than paper over the problems with technology , a few orthographic irregulars still cling to the vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Bernard Shaw advocated an entire- ly new 40-character alphabet . In 1906 Teddy Roosevelt decreed that all executive-branch documents would use simplified spellings for 300 words ; his efforts were thwarted by Congress . Beginning in 1934 , Col. Robert R. McCormick propagated some 80 simplified spellings ? including " iland , " " fantom " and " lether " ? in the Chicago Tribune , and his successors held on to " tho , " " thru " and " thoro " as late as 1975 . Had they continued , they might have had a thruway named after them . ) One of the few reformist groups still fighting on is Better Education thru Simplified Spelling , Inc. , in Detroit . President Charles F. Kleber says the current irrational English spelling system is responsible , at least in part , for the nation 's illiteracy problems , the dropout rate , crime , welfare dependence and drug and alcohol abuse . BEtSS hopes to start its revolution modestly , with just three words ? " tho , " " thru " and " hay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will create a " groundswell of grass-roots support " once the basic notion takes hold . Altered states : A simpler remedy for the mess of English spelling would be orthographic laissez faire , letting everyone spell at will with no points deducted for differences . As 19th-century humorist Artemus Ward asked , " Why care for grammar as long as we are good ? " But sticklers argue that if nothing else , variant spellings distract readers from the author 's point . " It 's like the absolutely smashing woman who comes into a room and the only thing you see is the run in her stocking , " says Kenneth Wilson . Another danger is that meanings might be misunderstood , even in subtle ways . Fitzgerald biographer Matthew Bruccoli notes that in the eloquent coda to " The Great Gatsby , " the author originally wrote : " Gatsby believed in the green light , the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us . " Fitzgerald wrote Perkins that he specifically meant the adjective of " orgasm . " But later editors were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more common " orgiastic , " the adjective of orgies , altering the meaning of one of the most famous phrases in American literature . As Fitzgerald himself might have concluded : So we poor spellers beet on , boats against the current , borne back ceeselessly into inglorious submision. @#
