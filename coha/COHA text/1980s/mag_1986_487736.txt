When contra leaders gathered in San Jose , Costa Rica , in late November to discuss a program for their post-Sandinista government ( a wild delusion ) , not all of their top men were in attendance . Arturo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo , leaders of the United Nicaraguan Opposition , showed up for the talks , but Adolfo Calero , head of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force , and Enrique Bermudez , the contras ' military chief , were conspicuous by their absence . Costa Rica 's President , Oscar Arias Sanchez , who considers both men military rather than political figures , had denied them visas . A year ago , when I visited San Jose in the final months of the administration of Luis Alberto Monge Alvarez , the country 's prized policy of neutrality was visibly under stress see Walton , " How the U.S. Is Changing Costa Rica , " The Nation , October 5 , 1985 . Monge 's statements about the Sandinista government next door were increasingly bellicose ; Green Berets were training the police of a nation that prides itself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Costa Rican security forces were more or less openly aiding contra troops in the north , whose presence the Monge government continued to deny . Arias , the nominee of Monge 's ruling National Liberation Party , took office in May as the peace candidate . His defeated opponent in the February elections was the hawkish Rafael Angel CalderOn Fournier , darling of right-wing U.S. fund-raisers , and a welcome guest at the Reagan White House . Some things under Arias are not . much changed . Costa Rica 's foreign debt stands at between $4.5 billion and $6 billion ; only Israel has a higher per capita debt burden . The country is still in desperate need of economic aid . Newspapers , radio and television have , if anything , stepped up their relentless drumbeat against Nicaragua . ( Only the English-language weekly , The Tico Times , provides balanced , fair coverage . ) And Arias 's criticism of the Sandinistas is even harsher than Monge 's . Yet although Arias 's anti-Sandinista rhetoric is tough enough to warm the hearts of the most fervid Reaganites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his accompanying promises of neutrality are unequivocal . Even more significant , in the early months of his administration , Arias has put his words into action . When Nicaraguan troops destroyed some buildings just inside Costa Rica 's border in early summer , . Arias 's Minister of Security , Hernin GarrOn , investigated and reported that the Sandinistas had been provoked by contra attacks . That would have been unthinkable tinder Monge , who used border clashes to accuse Nicaragua of acts of war . In July the Arias government deported two contras , and Garr6n stated outright that contra forces were operating from Costa Rica . Later that month , in an act that astonished the nation , Arias fired two high-ranking immigration officials , Juan Sanchez Solano and Guillermo Solis Espinoza , for permitting a clandestine contra hospital to operate . " We 're going to throw them out no matter who they are if we catch them helping the contras , " Arias said in August . The demonstrations of neutrality continued into September . On September 3 , Civil Guards occupied a secret airstrip near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights . The field was about five miles from the Murcielago base , where Green Berets had trained 1,500 of Costa Rica 's 6,000 Civil Guards . The Green Berets are now out of Costa Rica . On September 24 , Arias told the U.N . General Assembly that he would not allow the country to be used for military purposes . " We do not believe in this type of solution , " he declared , " and we have made this known to our best friends and allies in the international field . " Four days later , as if to drive the point home , a San Jos ? court handed down five-year prison terms to eight NiCaraguans , a Costa Rican , a Frenchman and a Briton forL66ininitting " acts hostile to Nicaragua . " There is widespread agreement that Arias is sincere in his professions of neutrality . HoweVer , there are equally widespread doubts about whether he can pull it off . Monge was engaged in a delicate tightrope act . He wanted his attacks on the Sandinistas to be harsh enough to keep U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash with Nicaragua . In 1985 about $200 million came directly from the Reagan Administration , with almost as much again from international lending agencies and private banks whose loans are subject to U.S. approval . The total infusion  --  about $1 million a day  --  contrasted sharply with the $16 million Costa Rica received from the Carter Administration in 1980 . When Reagan took office , Costa Rica was on the verge of economic collapse , its coffee and bananas competing in a saturated market while the price of oil and other vital imports soared . Inflation rocketed , thousands were out of work , interest on foreign debts could not be paid . Catastrophe seemed imminent until the Reagan Administration , seeking a second front against Nicaragua , discovered Costa Rica . Money began to pour in , the Monge government became more hostile to Nicaragua and contra activity in the country increased . Toward the end of his administration , Monge was plainly beginning to lose his precarious neutralist balance ; it seemed he would soon fall entirely into the U.S. camp . Monge was spared that disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma to his successor . Arias , a man of intelligence and enormous pride , is convinced that it would be fatal for Costa Rica to be sucked , December 20 , 1986 The Nation . into the Central American maelstroni . Plainly he has tried to eliminate an effective contra presence before part of the Reagan Administration 's $100 million in aid to the rebels begins to flow into his country , where many people  --  both inside the government and out  --  are genuinely sympathetic to the contras and/or are susceptible to bribery . If Monge was walking a tightrope , Arias seems to be'attempting what one observer called a game of international chicken , trying to convince the Reagan Administration that the survival of a liberal democracy in Central America is in the interest of the United States , even if the Monge government refuses to be pressed into joining the anti-Sandinista crusade . , . - The U.S. response so far has been ambivalent . The Administration has somewhat reduced its economic assistance-to Costa Rica over the past year , from $196.5 million to $151.1 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue . Certainly the United States has never been reluctant to exert economic pressure , and the Costa Rican economy is as vulnerable as ever . Arias has resumed making interest payments on the country 's foreign debt , ' which Monge had suspended , and those payments alone exceed $250 million this sear , , more than Costa Rica can expect to receive in new loans and grants . A year ago , Eltiardo Lizano Fait , head of the Central Bank , and Francisco Gutierrez , program director of a private think tank Called Economic and Financial Counselors , told me that the new government would have only a couple of , years to set its economic house in order before social unrest began . They may have been overly optimistic , ? for unrest has already started . September and October brought a wave of demonstrations , as labor unions protested that salary increases , averaging 4 percent , have fallen far behind the annual inflation rate , expected to reach 16 percent this year . All sectors of the economy were involved , from banana-plantation and dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of state-sector employees , with schoolteachers particularly militant . In response the government - has called for a " great national pact " to agree on wage restraints , though it can have few hopes that this will come about . , Both Lizano and Gutierrez agree that the recent drop in oil prices and the temporary rise in coffee prices ? which was caused by adverse weather in Brazil , the world 's largest Coffee producer , did not have as significant an effect as expected . Both say the nation must improve its export earnings and reduce its interest payments , but neither man is confident that Costa Rica will have any more success than other countries in a similar predicament have had . And reducing interest payments  --  assuming the creditors permit it  --  means an escalating debt , no matter how ingeniously the rearrangement is made . , Lizano is singularly candid for a presidential appointee , urging Arias , to bite the bullet early in his presidency . He argues , as does the International Monetary Fund , that as a necessary first step toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural production . In July , Arias removed a $30 million subsidy for basic some degree , and is reportedly considering selling some enterprises to the workers if A.I.D . pressure persists  --  hardly what the Reagan Administration has in mind . While Arias grapples With these conflicting forces , the debt grows , prices for basic foods and household goods increase , purchasing power shrinks with continuous inflation and devaluation , the middle class sees its prospects diminish and the tugurios ( " shantytowns " ) mushroom . Although the government periodically removes the tugurios from the airport road , they spring up again in areas less visible to tourists , to the south of San Jose . A new one , San Miguel Higuito , grew to a population of 15,000 in just three or four months and is visibly bigger each week . This is the context in which Oscar Arias Sanchez- must play his international game of chicken against a U.S. Administration determined to destroy the government of neighboring Nicaragua . If the Reagan Administration can not buy the cooperation , or at least the tacit acquiescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead regardless , building a southern front against the Sandinistas in the knowledge that Arias is powerless to secure his northern border and too financially dependent on the United States to resist politically in such multilateral forums as the United Nations or the Organization of American States . Few observers in San Jose doubt that Arias will make an honest effort to keep Costa Rica from being ground up by the Reagan Administration , but equally few would be foolhardy enough to bet - on his success . ?
