The number of undocumented/illegal residents in the United States remains uncertain . Census Bureau researchers , in a report for the select commission that was based on a review of existing studies , offered the following cautious speculation : // The total number of illegal residents in the United States for some recent year , such as 1978 , is almost certainly below six million , and may be substantially less , possibly only 3. 5 to 5. 0 million. // According to this report , Mexican nationals probably account for less than half of the undocumented/illegal population . Other large numbers come from Jamaica , the Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Haiti , South America and various Asian countries. // All studies indicate that undocumented/illegal aliens are attracted to this country by U.S. employment opportunities . Most come from countries that have high rates of under-@ and unemployment. // // ' Pernicious Effects ' Indicated // Although the research findings and theoretical arguments with regard to the impact of undocumented/illegal immigration upon the U.S. economy and social services are inconclusive , there is evidence that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on U.S. society. // This illegal flow , encouraged by employers who provide jobs , has created an underclass of workers who fear apprehension and deportation . Undocumented/illegal migrants , at the mercy of unscrupulous employers and coyotes who smuggle them across the border , can not or will not avail themselves of the protection of U.S. laws . Not only do they suffer , but so too does U.S. society. // Most serious is the fact that illegality breeds illegality . The presence of a substantial number of undocumented/ illegal aliens in the United States has resulted not only in a disregard for immigration law but in the breaking of minimum wage and occupational safety laws , and statutes against smuggling as well . As long as undocumented migration flouts U.S. immigration law , its most devastating impact may be the disregard it breeds for other U.S. laws. // The select commission favors immediate action to reduce the flow of undocumented/illlegal migration . To take no action will result in a worsening of the problem . Migrants will continue to enter the United States illegally , U.S. workers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the disregard for U.S. law will continue to strain the fabric of society . <> <> No Temporary Work Program // The commission has carefully weighed these arguments . Most commissioners have concluded that the commission should not recommend the introduction of a large-scale temporary worker program. // The commission proposes a three-part program to address this problem : // - Better border and interior controls ; // - Economic deterrents in the workplace ; and // - Once new enforcement measures have been instituted , legalization of certain undocumented/illegal aliens who are already in this country. // The select commission recommends that Border Patrol funding levels be raised to provide for a substantial increase in the numbers and training of personnel , replacement sensor systems , additional light planes and helicopters and other needed equipment. // During the past 10 years , the number of undocumented/illegal migrants , as measured by apprehensions , has increased much more rapidly than the personnel and funding levels of the Border Patrol. // At any given hour no more than 450 Border Patrol agents are directly engaged in activities to stop persons attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds has also stretched the replacement schedule for sensor systems - introduced during the last 10 years to aid the Border Patrol in detecting movement in isolated areas of the borders - to seven years , at least two years longer than the expected operating life of the systems . <> <> Regional Enforcement Posts // The select commission recommends that regional border enforcement posts be established to coordinate the work of the Immigration and Naturalization Service , the U.S. Customs Service , the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard in the interdiction of both undocumented/illegal migrants and illicit goods , specifically narcotics. // The select commission recommends that the law be firmly and consistently enforced against U.S. citizens who aid aliens who do not have valid visas to enter the country . Recent U.S. experience with the Cuban push-out and the resulting " freedom flotilla " in which private U.S. citizens transported persons who did not have valid visas to the United States has been a cause for concern . Though the commission recognizes the good will behind this and other such actions on the part of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entry of aliens who do not have valid visas - such assistance is illegal. // The select commission recommends that investigations of overstays and student visa abuses be maintained regardless of other investigative priorities. // The select commission recommends that a fully automated system of nonimmigrant document control should be established in the Immigration and Naturalization Service to allow prompt tracking of aliens and to verify their departure . U.S. consular posts of visa issuance should be informed of nondepartures . No adequate system now exists to check whether nonimmigrants leave the country in compliance with limitations on authorized stay or whether foreign students and other nonimmigrants are in status . <> <> High Priority for Training // The select commission recommends high priority be given to the training of Immigration and Naturalization Service officers to familiarize them with the rights of aliens and U.S. citizens and to help them deal with persons of other cultural backgrounds . Further , to protect the rights of those who have entered the United States legally , the commission also recommends that immigration laws not be selectively enforced in the interior on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The select commission recommends that legislation be passed making it illegal for employers to hire undocumented workers . Current Federal law provides no basis for the prosecution of employers who knowingly hire undocumented/illegal aliens . Even if an employer is found to be employing undocumented workers , the penalty is merely the cost of finding and training replacements . Furthermore , the employer is free to hire still more undocumented/ illegal aliens without incurring any additional penalties. // Although sanctions should apply to all employers , many commission members believe that small businesses employing only a few persons should not be the target of employer sanctions enforcement efforts. // The select commission recommends that a program to legalize undocumented/illegal aliens now in the United States be adopted . <> <> ' Enormous ' Costs to Society // The select commission holds the view that the existence of a large undocumented/illegal migrant population should not be tolerated . The costs to society of permitting a large group of persons to live in illegal , second-class status are enormous . Society is harmed every time an undocumented alien is afraid to testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illness that many constitute a public health hazard or disclose a violation of U.S. labor laws. // As continuing to employ existing enforcement techniques merely assures the continuation of current problems , the commission holds the view that legalization is a realistic response to the problem of resident undocumented/illegal aliens . It is of the opinion that legalization - following the institution of new , more effective enforcement measures - would be in the national interest of the United States for many reasons : // - Qualified aliens would be able to contribute more to U.S. society once they came into the open . Most undocumented/illegal aliens are hard working , productive individuals who already pay taxes and contribute their labor to this country. // - Legalized aliens would no longer contribute to the depression of U.S. labor standards and wages. // - For the first time , the United States would have reliable information about the sources ( specific towns , villages and provinces ) of undocumented/illegal migration and the characteristics of undocumented/illegal aliens. // The select commission recommends that legalization begin when appropriate enforcement mechanisms have been instituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary part of enforcement , but it does not believe that the United States should begin the process of legalization until new enforcement measures have been instituted to make it clear that the United States is determined to curtail new flows of undocumented/illegal aliens. // The select commission recommends that those who are ineligible for a legalization program be subject to the penalties of the Immigration and Nationality Act if they come to the attention of immigration authorities. //
