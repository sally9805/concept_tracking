" He ' s tough . " " He doesn ' t take any nonsense . " " He ' s a kid. " // Unlike many other rumors that filter through Riis - such as the recurring one about the project being converted into luxury co-ops - these were all true , and were verified in the form of the tough , no-nonsense 34-year-old manager who arrived in January 1984 to run this city housing project on the Lower East Side. // " The book on Bill , " said Jose Gonzalez , the superintendent of Riis , " was that he was extremely efficient and professional. " // What the book and the rumors did not say - and what tenants and employees throughout Riis said they have since learned - was that Mr. Russo was also compassionate. // He was expected by his bosses to be a manager who would reduce the rent delinquency rate , as he did , lowering it to 2. 87 percent last year from the 3. 34 percent it was when he got there . He was not expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , play with children in the day-care center. // Managing a housing project is in many ways like being mayor of a small city . At Riis , there are 19 buildings to oversee , 1 , 768 rents to collect , 70 employees to supervise , 17. 6 acres to maintain and more than 5 , 200 constituents to satisfy. // There are contracts to negotiate , supplies to order , services to provide and meetings to attend. // And there is pride to build , for a housing project is home for thousands of people , many of whom can not afford to live anywhere else. // The change in managers was only the beginning of an overhaul of the staff at Riis . Soon after Mr. Russo arrived , Mr. Gonzalez was hired as superintendent , replacing Thomas Gentile , who was convicted of extorting money from private contractors doing business with the project . <> <> Replacing Staff // Within the last two years , Mr. Russo and Mr. Gonzalez have replaced 41 of the 69 employees under them , including all three bookkeepers , three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought up for departmental trials on charges ranging from poor workmanship to chronic lateness and were penalized or dismissed , according to the Housing Authority ' s district supervisor for the area encompassing Riis , Cyril Grossman. // Most of the employees who left Riis , Mr. Grossman admitted , were absorbed by other projects . " Unfortunately , a lot of times we transfer our problems around , " he said. // The changes at Riis , however , have brought a boost in productivity and morale among the staff , according to Housing Authority observers and employees themselves - which has not gone unnoticed by the tenants . <> <> ' Going to Be Beautiful Again ' // " They ' re showing us that they care so we should start caring , " said Maria Medina , who has lived at Riis for 28 years and is president of its Tenants Association . " For so many years , this project was beautiful . " She said that now Mr. Russo and Mr. Gonzalez were in control , " it ' s going to be beautiful again. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that every building and every apartment is brought up to a standard that I myself would not have any problem living there. " // That desire is more than a bureaucratic standard for him ; for 10 years Mr. Gonzalez and his family lived in Rutgers Houses , a project farther south on the East Side . He now lives in a cooperative apartment that he owns on Grant Street , having worked his way over 25 years through the authority system , from caretaker to superintendent. // Riis Houses was Mr. Russo ' s first assignment as a manager . In his 10 years with the Housing Authority he has worked in various jobs , including housing assistant , the person who deals with tenants on most matters , and assistant manager. // But he was never before " mayor " ; he was never before responsible for reshaping a sagging project . <> <> A Different Approach // The first step in that process was obvious : strengthen the basics , such as maintenance .

About half of the 5 , 200 people at Riis are children , some of whom scribble on walls and elevators . Mr. Russo persuaded one of the maintenance workers at Riis , Chico Garcia , a former graffiti vandal who now puts his work on canvas , to teach graffiti art to the project ' s youngsters , hoping to similarly divert their activities. // " My role is to work the Housing Authority system to my tenants ' best advantage , " Mr. Russo said . " But I also expect a lot of my tenants . This is their home. " // On most days , the job is fairly routine : inspect apartments , go over rent logs , check housing police reports . But there are times when unforeseen events can shake a project , and it is then that a manager ' s abilities are challenged. // On a cold night last month , two men were shot in the lobby of 466 East 10th Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . The frightened tenants , though , did . But Mr. Russo and Mr. Gonzalez came in the middle of the night , answered tenants ' questions , allayed their fears and assisted the police. // " It ' s very important in a situation like that for management to be visible , " Mr. Gonzalez said . " Situations like that test the relationship between tenants and management . " <> <> ' Why Not the Best ? ' // And there are moments that simply enrich it . A few weeks ago , Mr. Russo stopped at the Virginia Day Nursery to discuss maintenance work with the director - then ducked into a classroom to play with the children. // " These are good people who will develop among themselves a good place to live if given the right set of circumstances , " Mr. Russo said . " I know this sounds idealistic , but why not the best for the people in public housing ? " // The Riis Houses are , in fact , not an example of the best in public housing ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and population statistics that are typical of the city ' s projects . But for several years recently , Housing Authority officials said , the averages at Riis were not adding up to a comfortable environment . Grounds were unkempt . Employees were lax in their work . Rents were late . Tenants were disgruntled. // " There seemed to be a lack of interest on the part of the manager and the superintendent , " Mr. Grossman said . " They weren ' t bad , they just weren ' t taking the project anywhere. " // The former manager , Gertrude Ford , disagreed that hers was a lazy administration . If anything , she said , she cared too much and was not strict enough in disciplining employees or penalizing bad tenants at Riis. // " I don ' t lay down the law and push people to the wall , that ' s not my style , " said Mrs. Ford , who left Riis after being promoted to supervising manager of the Queens district .

As manager , Mr. Russo is paid about $40 , 000 a year and oversees all activities ; as superintendent , Mr. Gonzalez is paid about $39 , 000 a year and directs maintenance work. // Housing Authority officials commend the way the two men work together . Emanuel P. Popolozio , chairman of the authority , said they were " like a coach and a manager of a baseball team. " // The tenants have come to expect a lot of their management team . Monthly Tenant Association meetings that were once kaffeeklatsches are now attended by vociferous tenants who , sensing a willingness to respond , seek changes. // At a recent meeting , Mr. Russo and Mr. Gonzalez were pelted by complaints : from one side by a tenant in 118 Avenue D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her building ; from another side by a tenant in 819 Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive , protesting that the walk near his building collects water when it rains , and from the center by a tenant in 90 Avenue D , complaining that an unlocked entrance allows drug dealers to sneak into the building. // Mr. Russo told the first tenant that if she felt harassed by the youngsters she should call the housing police , and he assured the second tenant that the grounds-improvement project under way at Riis would include fixing the walk . For the third tenant , he had no answer. // He explained that a contractor was hired to replace all the doorways , but that the job was not completed properly and a new contract was in the works . Even as he said it , he knew his reponse would not secure the entrance and would not keep drug dealers out of the building . <> <> Working Within Limits // " At times you have to take the heat , " Mr. Russo said , " and realize there are problems that take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , had recently organized a tenants patrol and he did not want the broken door to become a symbol to them that management did not notice or care. // " Joe , " he said to Mr. Gonzalez a few days later , " check if we have a door or a lock somewhere that we can put up and then deduct the amount from the contract. " // Good intentions , however , do not always materialize into deeds , and weeks later , the entrance is still open. // At times like that , even the seemingly indefatigable Mr. Russo and Mr. Gonzalez admit that their concern and their ability to effect change has limits. // " We can act as a resource center but not as a problem solver , " Mr. Russo said . " We are sympathetic to family problems , but we have to draw the line . Of course , it is never really a solid line. " //
