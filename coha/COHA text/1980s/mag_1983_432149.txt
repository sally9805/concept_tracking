 | From its creation , the United States has taken a proud stance before the world as a symbol of freedom and riches , a land where ambition and merit may lift any individual to the highest station . Yet , as the nation observes its 207th birthday , some are questioning whether the legend of the Land of Opportunity is truth or myth . There is no doubt that , as the Statue of Liberty proclaims , this nation still is " the golden door " for " huddled masses yearning to breathe free " all over the earth . Fleeing oppression in Poland , hunger in Haiti , warfare in Central America and the Mideast and Southeast Asia , half a million people immigrate legally to these shores every year . The number of those sneaking illegally across the nation 's borders is estimated at 1 million annually . And some make it to fame and riches . But for many of the native-born , " the American Dream " seems to be a frustrating , empty promise . They have been reared on the tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers , of the children of shopkeepers going to medical school , those of farmers becoming lawyers . That happens still , but for large numbers the prospect is downward mobility . The Labor Department forecasts that of the estimated 10.4 million people graduating from universities in the decade ending in 1985 , 2.7 million will work in jobs not traditionally filled by college graduates . What 's more , the nation 's economy appears to have grown a swelling underbelly of long-term if not permanently unemployable . The jobless rate is 10.1 percent , and legions of Americans desperate for work have hit the road in numbers not seen since the migrations of the Great Depression . Even with the economy rebounding , 1 million bluecollar jobs have vanished forever because of the nation 's shift toward the " postindustrial society . " For many of those whose concept of America is still being shaped , the outlook is especially troubling : The present-day unemployment rate for 20-to-24-year-olds now stands at 15.6 percent . Among blacks , 1 out of 5 is jobless . Will today 's young be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Consider buying a house . Twenty years ago , a new house sold for a median price of $18,000 on a 6 percent mortgage , and the payments took about 21 percent of a family 's median monthly income . Now , a new house costs a median $74,900 on a 12.8 percent mortgage that eats up 39 percent of median family income each month . All the while , the burden of federal , state and local taxes grows heavier ? from 15.1 percent of personal income in 1962 to 19.8 percent in 1982 . So should we run down the flag , play " Taps " for capitalism ? Is the time when an Andrew Carnegie could rise from bobbin boy to billionaire fading into history ? Consider this : During the boom year of 1978 , just 478,000 new businesses opened in this country . Last year , right in the midst of recession , 567,000 new ventures were begun . Turned off by limited opportunity available in established business , Americans are showing a startling propensity to start their own . And profitable fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conquer new areas of knowledge . Now , millionaires are practically commonplace , at last count totaling 638,000 , or 1 out of every 360 Americans ! There has been a recent , dramatic increase , too , of those who are not only millionaires but make a million dollars a year ? more than 5,500 today , compared with only 33 in 1920 . True , today 's income millionaires are only one fifth as rich as those with 1920 dollars , but there are 167 times as many of them . What keeps alive the vision of this land as a place of opportunity is that many Americans just wo n't give up on it . To find out whether their dreams still come true , and who has them , U S.News &; World Report sent staff members around the country in search of success . The following is a sample , from scores of reports of people who overcame great odds , of why the U.S. has reason to celebrate this Fourth of July In a three-month spree , Sirjang Lal Tandon spent the $3,000 his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was 18 years old , ashamed to ask for more money and down to his last $10 . So Tandon did what he says would be unthinkable for a boy of good family back home in India : He went to work as a busboy . Working nights in restaurants , Tandon paid his own way and earned top grades going to college days . He pushed on for a master 's degree in mechanical engineering that  | brought good jobs at IBM and at Memorex . In 1975 , he risked $7,000 of a job bonus to open his own business in a garage in this Los Angeles suburb . His first products were magnetic recording heads that put information on floppy disks ? the limber , recordlike devices that store information in computers . He managed to produce a magnetic head for $18 that had cost other firms $40 to make . Then , he patented a double-sided recording head that increased memory-storage capacity by 100 percent . Today , Tandon Corporation is worth 1.5 billion dollars , and sales are projected to reach at least 270 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than 40 employes , still on the job , have become millionaires through options Tandon has given them on company stock . To build and maintain a family spirit in his company , Tandon holds an annual picnic and a Christmas party that gets more lavish every year . In December , he booked the Los Angeles Convention Center for a prime-rib dinner for his workers and guests , with entertainment by Tony Orlando and three bands . Tandon is proud that his products bear the label , " Made in U.S.A. , " and that he is now an American citizen . " Every time I travel around the world , I like this country better , " he says . " America has the best tax structure in the world , leaving you with the maximum dollar to spend , " he adds . When people complain about the high price of real estate , Tandon counters : " Compared to what ? In Bombay , you can spend 2 million dollars for a two-bedroom flat . " Tandon 's greatest concern about America is the breakup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want most for each of my children is a good marriage and a good family life , " he says . " That is more important than the occupation they choose . " When he was establishing his business , Tandon went home for dinner every night to spend time with his Indianborn wife Kamla , his son and two daughters ? even though he would return to the office for the rest of the evening . The family is planning a move to a mansion they are building on a 20-acre site , with room for his Lamborghini , Ferrari , Porsche , three Rolls-Royces and two Cadillacs and his wife 's own Rolls and two Mercedes-Benzes . Tandon keeps close ties with his family in India and does n't forget his relatives there when he goes shopping . One recent weekend he bought them two Mercedes , a Ferrari and a Peugeot . Today , 23 years after ariving in the U.S. , Tandon says he has made " more money than the next four generations of my family will need to spend . " His climb required risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the great thing about America is that you can always do something for survival . " For 22 years , Addie Lindstrom held what she calls a " cushy " job as office manager for a giant forest-products company . The pay , working conditions and fringe benefits were excellent . But Lindstrom wanted more . So three years ago , ignoring friends who called her crazy and a recession that had damaged the state 's economy , she borrowed $50,000 and opened her own travel agency . " I did n't have a penny of my own and did n't know if I would be a success , " she says . " But I felt I could do as good as or better than the travel agents I 'd worked with in the past . " After taking a travel agents ' training course , she rented an office in the same building as her employer . At first she was reluctant to cut off a sure source of income , so she worked from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. at her old job , then went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiled until midnight . For four months , her agency did well . Then , riding home one night after meeting with a group soon to leave for Japan , the car she was riding in skidded off a rain-slick highway and plunged down a ravine . When she arrived at the hospital , Lindstrom had 57 broken bones and was so weak that doctors had trouble finding a pulse . " I had broken everything but my fingernails , " she recalls , " but the nurses tell me that even when I was still out of it , I kept mumbling about how I had to get back to the agency . " I was told I would never walk again , but I was n't interested in hearing that . As soon as I could , I started running things from my hospital bed . I hired two people , did the bookkeeping and the payroll . " It was almost two years before she returned to her agency full time , but meanwhile she had expanded to 10 employes . Business this year is expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-hockey team and her former employer , Champion International . Inspired by her own injuries , Lindstrom began to specialize in services for disabled travelers . She took a motorcoach tour of Europe with one leg in a cast just to see if it could be done . " Until you 're in this position yourself , you just do n't realize what others are up against , " she says . Though she must use crutches or a walker , Lindstrom says : " I 've come to realize that the hesitancies we have within ourselves are the only things that limit what we can do . " At age 10 and sometimes barefoot himself , Porterfield Wilson helped to support himself by shining shoes in front of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville , Tenn . Forty years later , Wilson lives in the Detroit area , one of the most successful auto dealers in the nation with gross sales last year of more than 20 million dollars . His is a classic rags-to-riches story ? of a young black boy forced to live with his aunt when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for a stepchild . Dropping out of high school , Wilson moved to Detroit , finding work on an auto-assembly line . It was 11 years before he landed a job with a dealer ? as a " hooker , " expected to bring black customers into a showroom where white salesmen would then make the sale and take the commission . By 1970 , Wilson had broken that barrier against black  | salesmen and saved enough money to open a Pontiac dealership . Inventory planners expected him to sell about 300 vehicles during that first year . He sold 1,000 . In 1978 , he and his wife also obtained Honda and Mazda franchises , becoming the nation 's first black foreign-car dealers . " I had never read a financial statement when I started the company , " Wilson recalls , " but I was determined to make this work . " Still mindful of " years of discrimination , " Wilson runs his own job-training program , hiring undereducated , unskilled people and giving them free courses in such trades as auto mechanics while paying them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that once they 've become successful , some people are only concerned with themselves . " Most of his employes are black , and many say they would not be working in sales but for Wilson 's success . The barriers that he broke give a special sense of achievement to the onetime shoeshine boy who was awarded a key to the city of his old hometown . As he points out , " When I was a little boy in Nashville , I was not allowed to enter the courthouse . I guess I 've come a long way . " The 6-foot-1 , 200-pound frame shows no trace of the polio that kept Bill Sarpalius out of school for two years and left him so wasted , he remembers , that " I could reach clear around my arm or leg with just my thumb and finger . " His new home on 10 rolling acres does not suggest childhood years when food donated by churches was about all that kept his family from going hungry . When his father left the family on its own , Sarpalius says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a drinking problem and could n't keep a job very long . " After two years in which Sarpalius and his little brothers ' paper routes often provided all the family income , the children were sent to Boys Ranch , an institution for underprivileged youth in the Texas Panhandle . Once there , he began lifting weights . By the seventh grade , he was strong enough to enter rodeos and play tackle on the football team . But he was two years behind his classmates because of time lost to polio , and his grades were poor . A friendly counselor took him aside and said , " Look at yourself ? you do n't have any goals . I think I 'm the only person at Boys Ranch who even thinks you 'll finish high school . I hope you do n't let me down . " After a sleepless night , Sarpalius decided that what he wanted to do in life was to help others , and to do that he had to improve himself . Six part-time jobs ? " everything from disc jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer " ? paid for a year of college . Winning state presidency of the Future Farmers of America , which included a scholarship , meant another year of college . After getting a degree in education , Sarpalius returned to Boys Ranch to help other underprivileged boys , working in the admissions office and teaching agriculture . Ultimately , he got a master 's degree by attending night school and became an executive for an agribusiness with 50 million dollars in annual sales . His appearances as FFA president had provided publicspeaking experience and had brought him to the attention of top state officials . In 1978 , he was hired by the Texas House to help voters solve problems with state agencies . In 1980 , he ran for the state senate , winning after a sunup-to-sundown handshaking campaign . Last year , he was re-elected by a 2-to-1 margin . In Austin , he is credited with persuading legislators to raise the legal drinking age to 19 and to give drunk drivers stiffer penalties . Now , he is fighting to ban open containers of alcohol in motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to try to help people , " says Sarpalius , " and when you do something to save lives , you 're helping people . " The important lesson of his life , he says , is that despite his handicaps , he had a chance to make it better . " One of the big advantages of living in America is freedom of choice , " he says . " I tell kids , Dream your dreams and make them come true . ' " Jeff Gold was furious . The furniture he wanted for his snazzy suite of offices in the Silicon Valley had not been shipped , and , after calling to find out why , he was told he would have to get someone to co-sign the order . It 's not that Gold 's credit was bad . Rather , someone apparently was suspicious of an order placed by a 16-year-old . Gold , who dropped out of high school in January after placing first in a statewide math contest and winning a scholarship to the University of California at Santa Barbara , is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $2,000 a week from a system he designed to prevent the illegal duplication of computer programs . Gold says he " realistically " expects to  | become a millionaire by age 18 and that sales from another project , which he declines to divulge , will top 200 million dollars . All that seems well within the reach of someone who mastered puzzles designed for 5-year-olds when he was 13 months old , taught himself math on an old electric calculator when he was 4 and had read the World Book Encyclopedia by the time he was 6 . Today , Gold 's company ? Double-Gold Software ? employs four people , and he is now incorporating and selecting a board of directors . More than 600 companies around the world have purchased his program , called Lock It Up , which sells for $225 and prevents the pirating of other computer programs . Now , after spending the spring quarter taking college courses , Gold has decided to return to high school . " I felt I was missing too much by giving up my senior year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 've never pushed me or discouraged me , " he says . " They let me take my own risks . " The only problem he admits to is that being a minor , he can not sign legal documents . " It bugs me that I 've got to ask my parents to co-sign all the time , " he says . " But I 'm working on some alternatives . " His formula for success : " Go do it . Never wait . Just do it and try to be successful ? but do n't pressure yourself . " Gold says he does not believe in failure . " If you start a company and go bankrupt , it does n't mean you have failed , " he says . " You will have learned from the experience . " Few immigrants ever reached these shores with poorer prospects than Armando Crucia . He came in the Mariel boatlift from Cuba to Florida in 1980 ? that exodus that truly fit the Statue of Liberty 's legend of " wretched refuse . " He was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all soon to be tarred with the reputations of a minority of their number who were let loose from Cuba 's jails and mental hospitals . Crucia had one possession : The pair of tattered shorts that he was wearing . Left behind were his two sons and treasured pictures of his dead parents . That first year , he toiled on a Texas turkey farm , strewing grain down the long pens and gutting the birds . Homesick for a Spanish-speaking community , Crucia took his meager savings , bought an old pickup truck and set out for Miami . There , for seven days a week , 10 hours a day , he drove through heavily Cuban neighborhoods , selling ice-cream cones . Now , as he reckons it , Crucia is a success . He owns a business . It is the La Islita Cafeteria , which has two small round tables , half a dozen bar stools and a take-out window . For decoration , there is a tapestry of Jesus standing in front of a Spanish village with His heart encircled by thorns . Specialties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steak-and-bread sandwich that sells for $1.90 and strong coffee . Every day , Crucia gets up at 4 a.m. to open up his restaurant . The only time he takes off is after noon on Sunday when he goes dancing , to the movies or just riding around . " It has been worth it , " he says . " It 's my life , this kitchen . " By the standards of most Americans , he admits , his achievement may seem small . But he says , " I did n't have this in Cuba before , so I 'm happier . I would never have owned my own business in Cuba , because over there everything is for Fidel Castro . " For 23 years the chef at a first-class Cuban resort hotel , Crucia 's ambition is to move up from his hole-in-the-wall cafe to a luxury restaurant featuring Cuban and Chinese cuisine . " I 'm a good cook , " he says confidently . But his profit is so low that he ca n't save . Most of his money goes for rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , he says : " In Cuba you do n't ever , ever have a chance of realizing your dreams . In the U.S. , here everybody can dream those things . If they work hard enough , they can achieve it . " Crucia says he is hurt by the perception of Mariel-boatlift refugees as undesirables . " Only about 12,000 were bad , " he declares . " Most were very hard working . " He does not feel that what he views as his success in America is unique . Anyone could do what he 's done in this country , he believes . In Cuba , Crucia observes , " I had lost ambition . But if you are taken out of the Cuban system and put here , it motivates you . Americans do n't appreciate the freedom they have . "
