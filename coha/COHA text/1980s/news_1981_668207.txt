Editor Cornucopia Massasoit Community College ( Alias Sitting Bull Community College ) Dear Mr. McHugh : I fail to see the point of your article , " Sitting Bull Community College Student Goes to Shrink . " While I understand your attempt at satire , I do not see any humor in it . So , Avi Rage feels that the school " sucks " does he ? - And because his friends and relatives make fun of it ? Have they gone to Sitting Bull or have they been lucky enough to afford Harvard ? Perhaps if Mr. Rage was not so concerned about having a place to hang out , he would notice that learning does go on for students who are willing to work . Worst of all , though , are the offensive remarks about older students . Mr. Rage , you will find prima donna ' s of any age , not just older students . If they intimidate you , perhaps you could use the experience to learn to stand up for yourself . Most of the older students that I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college and remain there , often at the expense of their family responsibilities and the loss of a second income . Finally , those " egotistical , pretentious and domineering old farts " will most likely be paying your salary if and when you graduate , and you would do well to learn to get along with them . I am 26 and consider myself neither here nor there on the age issue . I defend your right to write any kind of article you like , but I found this one to be totally insulting and tasteless . Yours truly , Lin Hughes Editor ' s Note : The writer of " Sitting Bull Community College Student Goes to Shrink " is 32 yrs . old and admits to being ( at times ) a " smart-ass ... domineering old fart . " In other words , he was also satirizing himself .
