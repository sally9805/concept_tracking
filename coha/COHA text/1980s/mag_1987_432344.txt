@#  | Massachusetts likes to call its capital city the " cradle of liberty " and compare it to ancient Athens . But these images of enlightenment have come under challenge in Boston 's golddomed Statehouse . The number of foreign students coming into Massachusetts , state Rep. Roger Tougas said , has " gotten out of hand . " He argued that the students have been " poshly subsidized by tax dollars , " even if they were from countries associated with terrorism . To discourage foreign students , Tougas introduced legislation to raise their tuition at public colleges . His bill passed easily , and Gov . Michael Dukakis signed it into law last June . Starting in 1988 , foreign undergraduates have to pay as much as 38 percent more than American youngsters from out of state . " Foreign students are not productive citizens , " said Tougas . " If they are going to reap the benefits , I just want them to pay for it . " Scattered episodes ? large and small ? indicate that resentment of foreign students is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tougas says he 's gotten inquiries from legislators in other states . An embarrassing incident took place at the University of Rochester in upstate New York . Because the unive : ' sity 's graduate business school had accepted a Japanese employee of Fuji Photo Film Inc. , the Eastman Kodak Co. ? fearful of corporate spying at its Rochester headquarters ? threatened to withdraw the 230 students it provides yearly to various programs at the school . The school caved in and rescinded the young man 's acceptance , but last month , after a public outcry , invited him back . ( He had already enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . ) Five years ago , when the number of foreign students hit 300,000 , concerned college administrators predicted a backlash of quotas , prohibitive tuition hikes and growing xenophobia . The resentment has been building gradually , though foreigners ac-@# count for less than 3 percent of the total college population . Fears that foreign graduates will snatch away good jobs from Americans ? particularly engineers whose profession draws the most foreigners ? persist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service says the majority of foreign students return home , and the Department of Labor reports that non-Americans constitute only 4 percent of the country 's engineering work force . Statistics also show that the 343,777 foreign students now in the United States ? two-thirds of whom pay their own way ? are a good national investment . Not only do they pump $2 billion to $3 billion into the economy every year , they bring distinction to second-rate colleges , keep graduate programs afloat and contribute to U.S. technology . Making foreign students welcome has always been a source of good will . Under the best of circumstances , the policy makes lifelong , sometimes influential , friends for the United States ? for example , both Corazon Aquino and Zachary Onyonka , Kenya 's foreign minister , graduated from U.S. colleges . Proponents of an open-door policy expect the same not only from the Malaysians and Taiwanese who are here in large numbers now but also from the students from oil-rich Iran and Nigeria who flocked here in the early 1980s . Why then do foreign students encounter  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly visible in certain disciplines . They earn from 27 to 41 percent of the doctorate degrees awarded in engineering , life sciences , architecture , computer science and mathematics . Some schools have consciously set out to lure talent from overseas to enhance the reputation of their graduate programs . The University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette , for example , built an $8 million computer system for studying factory automation ? the only one of its kind on an American college campus ? knowing it would attract the best minds in the world to study computer science there . Bachelor 's degree : Still , foreign students are not supplanting Americans in graduate schools ; they 're filling empty spaces . Americans simply are n't going to graduate schools in force anymore . At Syracuse University , where foreigners account for 70 percent of the graduate engineering enrollment , dean Theodore Bickart admits , " Quite frankly , they are sustaining our higher education . " Eager to make money , Americans tend to rush into the marketplace armed with only a bachelor 's degree . " Financially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Texan Michael Schuh , a Ph.D . candidate in mechanical engineering at the University of California , Berkeley . " Someone who 's been working for as long as I 've been in grad school will be making the same money . " More patient foreigners tend to be motivated by other goals . Schuh 's classmate Ching Bin Liaw of Taiwan says , " In Chinese society , a higher degree means people respect you and your family will be proud . " As the debate about foreign students heats up , educators , professionals and legislators offer controversial ? and often contradictory ? images of the 1990s . Some imagine university faculties clogged with foreigners ; others envision important scientific research left undone because all the Ph.D . ' s went home after all . The problem boils down to the absence of qualified Americans , a situation that can be remedied only over time by recruiting bright students for careers in scientific fields . " We 're shooting ourselves in the foot if we send foreigners home , " says Robert Weatherall , job-placement director at MIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further behind . " His point is hard to dispute . Imagine what might have happened if we 'd booted out Chinese-born Paul Chu in 1968 , right after he receiveL his Ph.D . in physics from the University df California , San Diego . Earlier this year Chu stunned the world when he used yttrium to make a high-temperature superconductor . The news may have reached the Massachusetts Statehouse : last week a legislative committee recommended repealing last summer 's tuition hike . 74 NEWSWEEK OCTOBER 19 , 1987
