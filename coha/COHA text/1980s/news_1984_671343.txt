The department is so understaffed , they say , that many probationers are committing new crimes without fear of being caught and sent to prison. // Unless the system is overhauled , said Lawrence T. Kurlander , Governor Cuomo ' s Director of Criminal Justice , " probation has ceased to exist as a viable proposal in the city of New York. " // The Probation Department has been overwhelmed by a problem that plagues much of the city ' s criminal- justice system : The agency ' s work load expanded while its staff and budget were cut . On average , a probation officer in the city handles about 215 cases at once - more than double the state average. // Judges place criminals on probation as an alternative to prison . Probation is considered punishment because probationers are expected to report to their probation officers regularly or risk being sent to prison . They are sometimes required to find jobs or go to school. // But in New York City , officials say , it often does not work that way. // Probation Department officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 adult probationers spend only a few minutes each month with their probation officers , who are supposed to provide employment counseling and other services . Some probationers receive no counseling at all. // " Because no one is controlling them , people on probation are engaged in a continuing wave of criminal acts against the public , " said Wallace Cheatham , president of the United Probation Officers Association , the officers ' union. // At least one out of every five adults on probation is arrested for a new crime within a year of being sentenced , according to city figures . " The Department of Probation is on the verge of total collapse , " Mr. Cheatham said , " and criminals know it. " // But while conceding that supervision of probationers is inadequate , probation department officials say the quality of other probation services , such as the preparation of presentencing reports , has improved in recent years . And a new $750 , 000 program announced last week , they say , will permit better supervision of probationers. // Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , which are widely thought to be underfinanced. // Under one proposal being considered in Albany , the state would absorb felony cases handled by the Probation Department and increase financing for probation services outside New York City . Chances for approval by the State Legislature are considered uncertain. // If the plan is not approved , several criminal-justice specialists say they will urge Mr. Koch and state officials to increase the Probation Department ' s budget significantly . With enough money , they say , probation could be an effective alternative to incarceration . <> <> Confusion With Parole // // Probation is often confused with parole , which is designed to supervise people released from prison after serving part of a sentence. // The decline of the Probation Department began during the city ' s budget crisis of the 1970 ' s. // Between 1974 and 1981 , the department was forced to reduce its staff by more than 35 percent , from 1 , 630 workers to 1 , 040 . The number , which includes supervisors , probation officers and support staff members , has since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly kept pace with the rise in the number of people on probation. // Over the last five years , the number of adult probationers has climbed by nearly half , to 39 , 000 today . Nearly 18 , 000 people were placed on probation in New York City last year. // And they have been placed on probation for more serious crimes . In 1978 , 65 percent of the adults on probation in the city had committed misdemeanors . Today , 65 percent are on probation for felonies. // Because of jail and prison overcrowding , officials say , judges have had to place people on probation who once would have been sent to prison. // That has left probation officers with what they frequently describe as unmanageable caseloads . Many say they have little time for anything but paper work . Morale among officers is low . One out of seven leaves the department each year . <> <> Constraints of Time // // The problems of probation officers are far less severe outside New York City . The average caseload is 57 in Nassau County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average is 93. // Probation Department officials say time constraints have forced many of them to ignore rules requiring them to make periodic visits to a probationer ' s home . A 1982 study by a state panel , the Legislative Commission on Expenditure Review , found that 85 percent of the people on probation in New York City received no home visits at all. // There are other complaints . Pay is chief among them . Probation officers receive a starting salary of $19 , 000 to $26 , 7000 , lower than comparable workers in other city agencies. // With so little supervision , probation officials acknowledge , many probationers are tempted to commit new crimes - some of them violent. // In a recent , highly publicized incident , a 21-year-old man on probation was arrested on charges of attempted murder last February in the shooting of a plainclothes police officer in Harlem . The officer nearly died. // " There are lots of other examples , " said Mr. Cheatham of the probation officers ' union . " There is no supervision of these people . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <> <> More Financing Sought // // According to the union , about half the adults put on probation are arrested for new crimes within a year of sentencing . The department says the figure is actually 20 percent. // The city ' s Probation Commissioner , Thomas L. Jacobs , said the department ' s budget had to be increased by at least half - from $28 million a year to $42 million - to provide adequate supervision . The state provides about 45 percent of the budget. // " We need new resources , we need new people , " said Mr. Jacobs , who has worked in city probation programs for more than 20 years . Too many probationers have an attitude that " probation is a joke , " he said. // Mr. Jacobs , who receives a salary of $71 , 000 a year , has been Commissioner since 1978 . In the next fiscal year , the department ' s budget is set to rise by about $2. 5 million . Of that , $750 , 000 has been set aside for the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program , a team of eight lawyers will be assigned to identify people on probation who have violated terms of their sentence . The probationers would then be sent to prison . <> <> ' Profound Implications ' // // James C. Shine , the department ' s first deputy commissioner , said the program would " get the word out on the street " that the department will not tolerate people who violate terms of probation. // " I think this will have profound implications , " he said . " This will make the probation sentence credible . Simply stated , the people who violate their probation are going to find there are consequences , which is not the case now. " // Yet the best hope for better probation services , department officials say , is a state takeover. // New York City officials , including Mayor Koch , have been reluctant to commit additional money to probation . They have argued for years that the state should be responsible for probation since it is usually state judges who sentence criminals to probation. // Instead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail space . Last year , Mayor Koch announced a $277 million plan to build new cells. // Probation " is not seen as a high priority in the criminal-justice system , " Mr. Jacobs said . <> <> Stronger Programs Endorsed // // That is unfortunate , according to many law enforcement specialists . In two recent reports - one by the City Bar Association , the other by a panel created by the city ' s Department of Correction - intensified probation programs were strongly endorsed. // Probation , the reports said , could be an effective and relatively inexpensive alternative to incarceration . According to city figures , the yearly cost for each person on probation ranges from $200 to $400 , compared with more than $20 , 000 a year for an inmate in prison. // " We ' re talking about a monumental difference in costs , " said Gerald W. Lynch , president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and chairman of the Correction Department panel . " Probation can be such a successful alternative when it ' s done right. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maximum of 25 cases has been widely lauded for turning probationers away from crime . About 500 probationers in New York City have been assigned to the program , which operates statewide. // Many politicians have been wary of supporting probation . Mr. Lynch said , however , that legislators and the public would be willing to accept an enlarged probation budget " if all the benefits were explained . " <> <> Failure of Cuomo Plan // // Earlier this year , Mr. Cuomo proposed creating a new state agency to handle probation for felons , which is now the responsibility of local governments . The plan did not survive budget negotiations in Albany. // A second proposal has been offered by Assemblyman Melvin H. Miller , chairman of the Codes Committee . Under that plan , which has been endorsed by Mr. Koch , the state would take over felony probation programs in New York City and expand financing to upstate probation agencies. // According to estimates , the program might eventually cost the state an additional $15 million to $20 million a year. // Assemblyman Miller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan are uncertain . " I ' m hopeful , but I make no predictions , " he said. // The Governor is said to be evaluating the plan . " The problem with the Miller proposal is that it only goes part of the way , " said Mr. Kurlander , the state ' s Director of Criminal Justice . " We ' d like the state to take over the entire probation system. " // But he said Mr. Cuomo might still endorse the plan . His support would be critical , according to Mr. Miller. // " If the Governor shows interest , then I think we may be able to do something this year , " Mr. Miller said . " I certainly hope we can . City probation needs desperate help. " // //
