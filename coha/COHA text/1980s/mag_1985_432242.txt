 | PITY BAHADUR SHAH II . A gentle man , poet and calligrapher , he had the misfortune to sit on the throne of Delhi in 1857 , year of fire and storm . On a May morning mutinying troops of the East India Company galloped to the Red Fort and cried , " Help us , oh King ! " This was a rare display of confidence in the aging monarch . Though respected by many in India , his kingship was a fiction . His family , of the lineage called Mogul , had been under the British thumb for half a century . By the evidence , he wanted no leading hand in the Sepoy Mutiny ( which Indians now call a war for independence ) , but he could not avoid being swept along on the bloody tide . And when the fighting was done , vengeance began . Bahadur Shah was incarcerated , accused of abetting the mutiny and of being at least an accessory to the massacre of 49 European-descended citizens . Three and a quarter centuries of sovereignty would crash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience hall within the Red Fort . Here diplomats and courtiers had once been dazzled by the gold and jewels of the Peacock Throne . To this sanctum Bahadur Shah was brought for trial . On a sultry morning I walked in the fort , tracing channels that had made fountains sparkle . The elegant Mogul creations scattered about the subcontinent ? palaces , gardens , mosques , tombs , even two cities ? have suffered from time and greed . Gilt has been scraped from panels where frescoed flowers bloomed ; precious stones have been pried from inlays . But in its perfect proportions and lustrous marble , the diwan-i-khas still echoes the grandeur that was . And the humiliation of the end . I can see the military judges taking their seats  |p468  and Bahadur Shah arriving under guard . Witnesses are called , documents presented . Sentence is pronounced : exile to Burma . In my mind 's eye the old man , as he is led away , glances up at the Persian script flowing above the pavilion 's arches . The majesty of his ancestors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is paradise on earth , it is this , it is this , it is this ! " Probably Bahadur Shah finds the legend mocking . But I like to think he manages a little smile within his beard , knowing that Mogul glory will endure long beyond this day . AT THE HEIGHT of their power , in the 1500s and 1600s , the Moguls ruled as many as 150 million people in an empire that today would stretch across Afghanistan , Pakistan , and India ( map , preceding pages ) . Akbar , whom most historians regard as the greatest Mogul ? indeed , Akbar means " great " ? was the most powerful ruler of his time , far exceeding , for example , his contemporary Queen Elizabeth of England in wealth and number of men under arms . Though they originated far off , in what is now Soviet Central Asia , and were Muslim lords in a realm largely Hindu , the Moguls stamped the Indian subcontinent with a culture and style remarkably resilient . Let me tell you about dinner at Karim 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Karim 's with silver and glittering chandeliers in New Delhi . In both restaurants the cuisine is imperial : a kofta of peppery ground lamb tenderly embracing a boiled egg ; succulent chicken roasted in a tandoor , a clay oven ; yogurt laced with spices that burst upon the palate like star shells . Such Mogul cuisine has subverted many Indian vegetarians . Painters perpetuate a Mogul style in miniatures , delicately stroking paper with brushes made of hair from a squirrel 's tail ? one hair to a brush . For millions in polyglot India and Pakistan , the tongue that surmounts regional differences is Urdu , dominantly a blend of Hindi with Persian , the language of the Mogul court . Mogul ways also survive in politics ? unfortunately , for brother often fought brother . One day I visited a living personification of the empire . Qamar Sultan , titled begum , or princess , is the great-granddaughter of Bahadur Shah . There is nothing that speaks of royalty in her small home among the crowded alleys of Old Delhi . For sustenance this frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her daughter , Pakeeza . The begum did not enter the Red Fort until she was past 50 , and when she saw the diwan-i-khas , she wept . " I was thinking of my father , that he might have occupied a position there . " On those times , rare now , that the begum leaves her home , her neighbors bow . Even in poverty her line commands respect . Historians count six rulers as Great Moguls , beginning with Babur in 1526 and continuing through Aurangzeb , who died in 1707 . Though a cruel streak ran through them all , they often gave generous terms to enemy chieftains , and on the whole they were intelligent , urbane overlords . Among their forebears was the all conquering Genghis Khan ? hence the name Mogul , the Indian version of Mongol . But the forebear they most admired was another conqueror , Timur , or Tamerlane . Timur was a Turk ? not a Turk of Constantinople but of their homeland in Central Asia . Though he was as much a scourge as Genghis , Timur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lovely buildings . His passions flowed through the family tree . Were they living today , you would find the Great Moguls decorative guests at a cocktail party . All save one would imbibe ; Islamic abstinence was not to their taste . Babur , whose name means Tiger , would talk of the gardens he created . A candid fellow , he confessed in his memoir , the BaburNama , a moonstruck yearning for a boy . ( But he fathered at least 19 children . ) Humayun ( Fortunate ) might talk of books ; in ignominious flight much of the time after succeeding Babur in 1530 , he packed his library along . He was too easygoing . But he emerged on top , handing a fledgling empire to Akbar in 1556 . Akbar would question you about your religion ? and might incorporate its tenets into one he was fashioning . As he discoursed on diverse subjects , it would never occur to you that he could not read . Jahangir ( World Seizer ) also would talk of @#  |p469  gardens and the artists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he surrendered to alcohol and opium ; his shrewd wife ran the empire until he died in 1627 . Shah Jahan ( Sovereign of the World ) would expound on symmetry in architecture . His taste for grandeur had a flip side of sadness ; he ended life as a prisoner gazing out at his grand creation , the Taj Mahal . Finally Aurangzeb ( Ornament of the Throne ) , also known after 1658 as Emperor Alamgir ( Seizer of the Universe ) . He thought music and pomp sinful , and he 'd decline a drink , thank you . Possessed of bulldozing determination , he expanded the empire to its greatest limits ; but while he was off campaigning , it collapsed internally . All in all , theirs was a remarkable 181-year run of fathers and sons . Their common failing was the inability to pass on the crown without a family fight , usually bloody . NEAR PANIPAT , 50 miles north of Delhi , a young man named Om Prakash said , " Here all place battlefield . " I saw only a pancake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Om said . I saw only irrigation canals . But Om was right about that ditch . In 1526 Babur arrayed his army beside Panipat , behind a ditch and farm carts lashed together . He was about to cap a lifetime of campaigning with his greatest victory . Babur had become a chieftain at the age of 11 , after the death of his father , who ruled the region called Fergana , now part of the Uzbek and Kirghiz Republics of the Soviet Union . His father , Mirza ( Prince ) Umar Shaikh , had been in his pigeon house at the edge of a ravine . Apparently the foundation collapsed . Babur records : " Umar Shaikh Mirza flew , with his pigeons and their house , and became a falcon . " Fortunately there were loyal nobles to aid the young leader , for Fergana was threatened by neighbors eager for land and spoils . Boy ruler soon became boy buccaneer , seeking spoils himself . West of Fergana gleamed rich Samarkand , It looked like an easy prize . Babur was 14 when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won it again , but still could not hold on . And while preoccupied with Samarkand , he lost Fergana . Wandering south in 1504 into present-day Afghanistan , he found the ruler of Kabul unprepared to withstand a siege . This easy victory gave him a base for future conquests . He felt secure enough to promote himself from mirza to padshah , " supreme lord , " a title his successors also  |p470  adopted . He took Qandahar , the major city of the Afghan south , and four times enriched himself on raids into Hindustan . The fifth time he meant to stay . Ibrahim , the Muslim sultan of Delhi , marched to confront him at Panipat with 100,000 men and 1,000 elephants , the tanks of the 16th century . Padshah Babur had perhaps 25,000 troops and fast ponies ? plus matchlocks 470 and mortars , probably from the Ottoman Turks , the artillery masters of his day . These weapons had not reached northern India . On a previous expedition the matchlocks blazed at tribesmen who had not heard the report of gunpowder . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like Babur with his great ditch and carts , the cautious Ibrahim also prepared defenses . Babur goaded him , sending out raiding parties . Finally Ibrahim committed the error Babur waited for : He advanced . Babur 's bowmen rained arrows upon the horde . His guns belched a slow but probably unnerving fire . Then the Mogul cavalry clasped the enemy flank and rear . Ibrahim " fell back on his own center . " Discipline dissolved in that mass of men and beasts . It was over by noon . Ibrahim and 20,000 or more of his men were dead . AGRA LONG AGO became an industrial city , place of smoke and dust . But there are reminders of elegance in Agra , and not just the Taj dome floating over the cityscape . In a jewelry shop Ghanshyam Mathur took from a safe a necklace put up for sale by a local family . I counted nine emeralds and two rubies the size of finger joints . These were not faceted stones ; they had merely been smoothed by tumbling . " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is the kind of jewelry they had . " In quest of such booty Babur hurried his son Humayun from Panipat to Agra , which as well as Delhi had served Ibrahim as a capital . ( Both cities also would servd the Moguls . ) The wealth was great . Padshah Babur heaped coins upon his troops , even sent a coin to every citizen in Kabul and gifts to holy men in Samarkand . In Babur 's memoirs I can almost see him looking about and taking notes . He described monkeys , peacocks , and parrots that people " make speak words . " But on the whole he was not pleased . " Hindustan is a country of few charms . Its people have no good looks . . . of genius and capacity none . . . there are no good horses , no good dogs . . . . " And the gardens ! " We traversed them with a hundred disgusts and repulsions . " Forthwith he laid out a better one . Babur 's years in India would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would spend much of his time fighting other monarchs in this mosaic of competing kingdoms . In 1530 Humayun fell ill . Babur 's daughter , Begum Gulbadan ( Princess Rose Body ) , wrote that Babur offered his own life to Allah in exchange for his eldest son 's . Humayun recovered , Babur fell ill . He tried to put family affairs in order , arranging marriages for his daughters . Then his lifelong campaign was finished . BESIDE THE GANGES eternal India dwells . On a sunless morning that foretold the monsoon 's coming , pilgrims descended the ghats , the steps cascading to Mother India 's holy river at Varanasi ( Banaras ) . In the soupy water , men and women of beatific countenance chanted mantras as they immersed themselves , washing away sin . Mohammad Nasir filled a goatskin bag with water to cleanse a latrine . He is called Little Boy , for he barely clears five feet . In 1539 Humayun 's survival depended upon a bhisti ? a water carrier ? at Chausa , near Banaras . Surprised by a cunning adversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many drowned as they fled . " I know there was some king who was drowning , " Little Boy said . " A bhisti inflated his water bag and gave it to the king to hold on to . " He did not know that the ruler was Humayun . Or that no bhisti ever received grander treatment : He sat on the throne and gave orders for a short time . Humayun had not been aided at Chausa by brother Kamran ; instead Kamran had marched as if to claim the throne . Time and again Humayun 's three brothers would thwart him . And time and again tolerant , forgiving Humayun would embrace them . In 1540 he again confronted Sher Shah ? again without Kamran 's troops . Sher Shah rolled up the Mogul forces and proceeded to roll up the empire , crowning himself at Delhi . Humayun abandoned Agra . Kabul was a possible refuge , but it was  |p474  Kamran 's province . Humayun was not welcome . Accompanied by a few faithful emirs , Humayun became a homeless padshah . THE YEAR 1542 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pursued by local chieftains . My thermometer showed 105 ? F the day I got to the vicinity of this odyssey of misery . South of Jaisalmer , which still wears the medieval look of a fortified town , dwell people who must be among India 's most tenacious . The women fascinated me . Slender and wiry , with flashing teeth , bangled from wrist to bicep , they counterpointed the bleak sandscape in fabrics dyed vermilion and orange . I glimpsed them filling jugs at wells . " Our women , " said an old man , " spend half their lives going for water . " Water . Humayun 's band crossed the desert in desperate thirst . Finding wells , people flung themselves at the buckets , breaking ropes , falling in . Humayun 's teenage wife , Hamida , was pregnant , and she hungered for ? a pomegranate . Humayun surely thought it a good  |p475  omen when a trader fished one from a sack . When they reached Umarkot , in today 's Pakistan , Hamida delivered a son ? Akbar . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The elegant Persian culture , which valued poetry and art , entranced Humayun . On departing , he took along two **25;757;TOOLONG of the Mogul painting style . With an army provided by Persia 's shah , Hamayun captured Qandahar , which was held by his brother Askari . Then he pried Kamran out of Kabul . But for eight years @# more the brothers fought across the Afghan countryside , the clashes interspersed with family reunions . It was too much for Humayun 's nobles . At a time when Kamran was a captive , they demanded that Humayun " put aside brotherly sentiment . " He vacillated , then ordered Kamran blinded , a Central Asian way of making a royal heir ineffective . One version says his eyes were repeatedly stabbed , after which salt and lemon juice were poured in . Meanwhile , the kingdom founded by Sher Shah had collapsed , and northern India was  |p477  ripe for reconquest . Humayun marched down from Kabul and in 1555 took Delhi . Here he placed his precious books in what is today called the Purana Qila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrologers on the roof . Descending , he tripped , struck his head , and at last knew peace . He had been back on the throne of India just six months . PRACHEE ANAND , kathak dancer , reverently touched the feet of her guru and received , with his blessing , her ropes of ankle bells . Then , to the staccato thump of the guru 's drum , her feet stamped , setting the bells ajangle . Her hands flew in crisp motions , her body spun in precise pirouettes . I watched the two of them in practice in a studio in New Delhi . Prachee has spent most of her 24 years under the tutelage of this master , Maharaj Bansilal . " She is very good , " he said . In Mogul times Prachee probably would have been summoned to execute her perfect pirouettes at court . Kathak dancers were Hindu temple dancers who related stories of gods and goddesses . The Moguls made them secular entertainers as well . The 49-year reign of Akbar was a time of unprecedented cultural amalgamation . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tax on non-Muslims . Akbar abolished it . Among his wives ( he seems to have had about seven , plus concubines ) were Hindu princesses . Hindus became administrators and generals . Akbar was just 13 when his father , Humayun , died . For several years he was dominated by the harem while Maham Anga , who had been Akbar 's wet nurse , pushed her own son , Adham Khan , toward power . Matters came to a head when Adham Khan had Akbar 's chief minister stabbed . Entering the public hall just then , Akbar knocked out Adham Khan with his fist and had him thrown from a rampart . When the first fall did not kill him , Akbar had him thrown again . Petticoat rule was finished . As a youth he was more interested in riding fighting elephants than in studying Persian literature . Being unable to read proved no handicap . He surrounded himself with scholars and had his artists make history visual . Many Mogul miniatures hanging in museums today were illustrations for the texts in his vast library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . Jaunpur , in the east , was annexed . He bulldozed through Gondwana , gathering jewels and gold . In 1567 he set out to topple the Rana of Mewar , Udai Singh . Akbar arrayed his army beneath the rana 's fort , Chitor , which crowned a soaring ridge in Rajputana , today 's Rajasthan . Or , as Akbar 's biographer , Abul Fazl , tells it , the " world-conquering mind " deployed his " sublime army " beneath the " sky-based fortress . " Abul Fazl never missed a chance to strew his ruler 's history with flowery phrases . No doubt imperial vanity was involved . But so was the Mogul love of records ; conscientiously , Abul Fazl produced most of the vast Akbar-Nama ( History ofAkbar ) and a vaster compendium of statistics and minutiae . We learn from him , for example , that Akbar ate one meal a day ? of 40 dishes ? and enjoyed ice brought from the mountains . Of Chitor , Abul Fazl chronicled that Udai Singh , " that vagabond , " decamped before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but left behind 5,000 gallant Rajputs . The " tiger of the mighty forest " breached the walls of the fort by detonating gunpowder but failed to gain access . He then concentrated on building a sabat , a covered corridor , above ground level , protected from enemy gunfire and arrows by rubble and stretched hides . Once the sabat reached  |p479  the wall , Akbar 's men would open a hole . The biographer depicts Akbar at the fore , dropping Rajputs with musket shots . Of course he credits the padshah with the decisive shot that felled Chitor 's commander . Fires were now seen in the fort . Anticipating defeat , the proud Rajputs sent 300 women to death in flames rather than allow them to be captured . Akbar raised the toll . Because the Rajput peasants had offended him in their partisanship , " the great warrior " massacred nearly 30,000 . Mogul armies continued to march , but Akbar , dealing from a position of strength , found easier ways to add dominions . It is said he sneaked into Ranthambhor , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on a cushion and said to the ruler , " Well , Rao Surjan , what is to be done ? " Rao Surjan became an ally . Compelling the surrender of Sind , Akbar allowed its ruler to govern his dominions . But henceforth Sind paid tribute . THE SMALL tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti stands across a court from the great mosque at Fatehpur Sikri . " Make a wish , " urged the caretaker , who seemed as ancient as the tomb . He proffered a bit of thread and indicated a window of latticed marble . " People make a wish and tie a thread , " he added . Hundreds of threads webbed the latticework . " What do they wish for ? " I asked . " Most wish for a son . " " Are Christians allowed to wish here ? " " Christian , Hindu , Muslim , it makes no difference . " Akbar would have it so . Elements of Christianity ? gleaned from conversations with Jesuit priests from the Portuguese colony of Goa ? were part of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobles by ordaining this as a state faith , but some historians believe that , personally , he abandoned Islam . Wanting a son , Akbar sought the blessing of Shaikh Salim , the holy man now buried in the marble tomb . His prediction was encouraging : Akbar would have three sons . The padshah installed his pregnant wife in the holy man 's hermitage , at the village of Sikri , 23 miles from Agra ; proximity might enhance the chances for an heir . She gave birth to the future emperor Jahangir . Before  |p483  long , concubines delivered two other boys , fulfilling the prophecy . By 1571 Akbar had decided to move to this fortunate place . On an outcrop of sandstone , he began to build the capital that would be called Fatehpur Sikri . Up went palaces , an awesome gateway , administrative buildings . He departed after 14 years , moving his base to Lahore while campaigning in the west . So the Fatehpur Sikri I saw was a glorious ghost town of vast buildings stairstepping toward the top of the ridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I heard only the mournful cries of doves and the lonely echo of my own footsteps . Akbar stitched his empire with roads , improving communications . He organized his officials , giving them ranks called mansabs , with authority weighed by number : One man might be a mansabdar of 1,000 ; a greater official might rank 2,000 , even 4,000 . Each was expected to maintain troops , according to his rank , for the empire 's use . For compensation each received a jagir , an area of land . Ownership remained in the hands of local people , but the mansabdar was permitted to extract sufficient revenue to maintain himself and his soldiers . In the last years of the 16th century Akbar , sovereign of an empire stretching from Kabul to the mouth of the Ganges , was troubled by his sons . Murad and Daniyal died drunkards . And Jahangir chafed to rule . At one point he started toward the capital with troops . But Jahangir had only to wait . In 1605 , on his deathbed , Akbar beckoned him to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a Mogul there , enjoying life in a palace . In truth , Maharaja 's Palace was a houseboat moored on Nagin Lake near the city of Srinagar . But a real palace it seemed , plush with carpet and fragrant with the cedary aroma of deodar . No sooner had I moved in than Mister Marvelous arrived . Excuse me : " Mister  |p484  Mah-vel-ous , " to write it as he sang it . His real name was Ghulam Hasan , and his face glowed with mirth ? or with the prospect of plucking a fresh bird . He paddled up in a gondola-like shikara laden with carnations , dahlias , and chrysanthemums . And he sang , " They are beau-ti-ful , they are glor-ious ! Today you buy whole shi-kar-a ! " " Not to-daay ! " I warbled . Ignoring my protest , Mister Marvelous nimbly boarded my palace , stuffed vases , and left me $27 poorer . " The flowers of Kashmir are beyond counting and calculation , " Jahangir exclaimed . His love of the Vale of Kashmir , nestled among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jahangir could pass the summer in Kashmir admiring beauty and sipping spirits ? six cups daily at this stage of his life , followed by opium ? testifies to the security of the Mogul realm . Akbar had built well . Jahangir graced a hillside with the gardens called Shalimar , Abode of Love . Like other Mogul gardens it is terraced and divided by a cascading stream . " This place , " he wrote , " is one of the sights of Kashmir . " It remains so . One day I watched a couple at play on the velvety grass . She was about 22 . Lying near her friend , she rolled toward him , smiled bewitchingly , and rolled away . Toward him again , then away . Each time she almost touched him ? but not quite . It was a display worthy of the Abode of Love . Last summer I checked into the Broadway Hotel in Srinagar just in time to be locked up . Or " hotel arrested , " as Indian newspapers described the status of the several journalists prevented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim , Kashmir has been the cause of two wars between officially @#  |p485  secular India and officially Muslim Pakistan . Internally , its flower-decked image is shattered by periodic upheavals . The trigger this time was the toppling of the state government headed by Dr. Farooq Abdullah . Mrs. Indira Gandhi , India 's late prime minister ? felled by Sikh assassins last October 31 ? had accused Dr. Abdullah of anti-Indian acts . She replaced him with his archenemy : his brother-in-law . Kashmiris took to the streets . With the city under curfew and armed security men at the hotel door , we journalists made the best of it for a day and a half , sipping beer and dipping in the pool . Another person confined in the city of Srinagar that same time was Mrs. Maneka Gandhi , the prime minister 's daughter-inlaw and widow of her son Sanjay . A politician herself , and also a bitter opponent of Mrs. Gandhi , Maneka had flown to Srinagar in support of the deposed Dr. Abdullah .

Here he built a palace with " soul-exciting sitting places . " Courtiers also built palaces here and copied the imperial zeal for gardens . In the Lahore Museum I admired magnificent specimens of calligraphy ? pages from Korans illuminated , gilded , and decorated with tiny flowers . Under the Moguls , Lahore boasted weavers , carvers , tilemakers , and miniaturists . Jahangir decorated his palace with " paintings by rare artists . " He knew the styles of painters in his assembly-line atelier so well that he could  |p486  tell who had painted an eye in a portrait . Crassly , Jahangir totted up the value of the gifts his nobles showered upon him , recording , for example , that jeweled vessels , Persian robes , and elephants from a khan were worth 150,000 rupees . He kept only the best , returning the others . Scouts searched out tigers and rounded up antelope to kill . By age 50 he had slaughtered 3,203 quadrupeds and 13,964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amateur naturalist , he explored the innards of his prey and meticulously described the mating act of cranes in his menagerie . It distressed him to see elephants spraying themselves with cold water on cold days . He ordered the tanks in the royal elephant stables heated . Meanwhile , his favorite wife , Nur Jahan ( Light of the World ) , became the power behind the throne . A clever businesswoman , she also shot tigers from an elephant . Far less is known of most of the women ? wives , aunts , nieces , concubines , slave girls ? cloistered in Mogul harems . Only family and a few nobles saw royal women unveiled . At court , Sir Thomas Roe , envoy of the young East India Company , observed fingers poking through a reed screen . Eyes appeared ; the ladies were trying to get a better look at him . Had there been no other light , he wrote , " ther diamondes and Pearles had sufficed to show them . " For a time Prince Khurram enjoyed Nur Jahan 's favor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored another imperial son , Shahriyar . Khurram recruited nobles with their troops . For three years loyal and rebel forces marched and skirmished . A tenuous peace was restored in 1625 . Two years later a feeble , asthmatic Jahangir made one more trip to Kashmir . The caravan returning in autumn became a cortege . Khurram took the throne as Shah Jahan . Shahriyar 's eyes received the lancet , and with four royal kin he was put to death . Nur Jahan now busied herself building tombs for Jahangir and herself near Lahore . To get from one to the other , I followed a road that crossed railroad tracks ; British surveyors did not think it necessary to route trains around the royal cemetery . A sign at the crossing says , " Complaints may be entered in the book kept with the gatekeeper . " I imagine the two royal ghosts scribble angrily there every night .

The fingers of his left hand ? long , artistic fingers ? applied a sliver of malachite to the grinding surface . Mohammad is certain that his craft has not changed since the 1600s , when Taj Ganj was the home of artisans building the Taj Mahal . He is equally certain that his forebears helped decorate that magnificent mausoleum with bits of turquoise , lapis lazuli , jasper , malachite , coral , and carnelian . These became petals , leaves , and trailing tendrils . Inlaid in marble , the floral displays added delicacy and grace . In Agra today three thousand men piece semiprecious stones into marble tabletops and boxes . The morning I met Mohammad he was inlaying a rose in a platter . He has a craftsman 's pride in his work , but the pay is meager ? five to ten dollars a day . " There is no time for art , " he said . " This has become too commercialized .

He raised an exquisite marble palace in Agra 's fort . As a prince , he took three wives , but was devoted to Arjumand Banu , titled Mumtaz Mahal ( Chosen One of the Palace ) . By 1631 she had borne him 13 children , of whom seven were living . That year she gave birth to a daughter ? but died in delivery . Shah Jahan spent two years in mourning . But well before the end of this time he was planning a grand tomb for Mumtaz Mahal  |p487  ( whose title in shortened form became the name by which the tomb is known today ) . Artisans were summoned : a specialist for the dome from Turkey , a master mason from Baghdad . For two decades 20,000 workers labored on the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document survives that names a Taj architect . Some scholars assign the honor to Ustad Ahmad Lahori , architect of other of Shah Jahan 's buildings . Perhaps the design was the work of a committee , with the padshah himself taking a leading hand . In any case , the design is not original . Humayun 's tomb in Delhi , built almost a century before , seems a prototype . Similar minarets had risen in Lahore , and the cupolas beside the dome ? classic Indian embellishment ? were to be seen everywhere . The great achievement of the Taj 's architect , or architects , was the refinement of these elements into harmonious symmetry . The Taj exceeds the sum of its inspirations . Historians have proposed that in building 4  |p489  grandly Shah Jahan was determined to outshine Persia 's ruler , Shah Abbas I , who had created a splendid capital at Isfahan . As he conducted affairs from his Peacock Throne , a golden divan surmounted by bejeweled peacocks , perhaps Shah Jahan also wished to hide the cracks that were appearing around his kingship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed shares of land revenue . Emulating their rulers ' love of palaces , jewels , and gardens , many complained that their jagirs were insufficient . Shah Jahan relaxed their military obligations ; in fact the nobles did not maintain even a fraction of the troops they had pledged to keep . And the armies now proved vincible . Prince Murad led 50,000 soldiers toward the Mogul homeland ; to reclaim Samarkand was an imperial dream . This campaign failed , even after Prince Aurangzeb took command . And Persia grabbed Qandahar . Three times Shah Jahan attempted to win it back ? and could not . LORD HELP THE PADSHAH who has four healthy sons . Shah Jahan favored as his successor the eldest , Dara Shikoh . The three others , Shah Shuja , Murad , and Aurangzeb , were usually posted in far-off provinces .

He surrendered to his son after three days , becoming a prisoner in his own wonderful buildings . Aurangzeb proclaimed himself emperor in 1658 . Dara Shikoh , captured , was beheaded in prison . Murad followed him in death . Shah Jahan lived eight years more , gazing out at the Taj Mahal , the monument by which the Moguls would be best known to the world . At his death in 1666 , his body was placed beside that of his beloved Mumtaz Mahal . @# IN THE VAST COURTYARD of the Badshahi Mosque , which Aurangzeb built at Lahore , a small , grizzled man told me a story about the sixth of the Great Moguls : " Though he was ruler of all India , his wife was preparing chapati with own hand .

" Do not believe that Aurangzeb 's wife made bread with her own hands . But there is a kernel of truth here : Aurangzeb did write copies of the Koran and stitched caps . His will pledged the rupees from Korans to holy men ; the caps were to pay for his funeral . I heard the caps and Korans story in various forms from Muslims in both India and Pakistan . It is cited as proof of Aurangzeb 's simplicity and piety ? characteristics , especially the piety , that make him , in some Muslim eyes , the greatest of the Moguls . Many Hindus have a different view . He reimposed the jizya , the tax on nonbelievers , and had new Hindu temples pulled down , shaking the communal tree that Akbar had nourished . Some historians regard Aurangzeb not as anti-Hindu but as an orthodox Muslim following the precepts of his faith ; the jizya and the destruction of temples are specified in the Koran . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials than any previous padshah ; he needed their troops . Court life became austere . Aurangzeb forbade alcohol , banned gambling and 489  |p490  music . Miniaturists continued to paint , but their art was less appreciated . More and more Aurangzeb became preoccupied with the Indian south , especially the rough hill country of the Deccan , where the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golconda and the fierce Marathas defied his sway . In what is today Maharashtra , which includes Bombay , his armies confronted a master guerrilla fighter . The heavily armored Moguls were bedeviled by fleet Maratha warriors led by this regional chief ? today a national hero ? named Sivaji , the " ji " being a mark of respect . In 1681 Aurangzeb himself went south to campaign . The Mogul court was no longer in Agra or Delhi or Lahore ? among the greatest cities of the world ? but in a modest little place that the padshah named Aurangabad . Incredibly , Aurangzeb remained in the south for 26 years . Now a city of 300,000 , Aurangabad still bears a few marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelt , young Indians now study graphic arts .

Bath chambers are classrooms . The massive arches of the former palace are a far cry from the delicate creations of Shah Jahan . At an intersection I gazed at a noble statue . This leader prancing on a charger in Aurangzeb 's chosen capital is Sivaji . The Deccan honors its own . Capturing Bijapur and Golconda , Aurangzeb expanded the Mogul realm to its greatest dimensions . But he was never able to wholly stamp out Maratha resistance . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system was sinking in corruption and under the demands of hordes of men for land and status . There were uprisings . The treasury was drained . I drove out of Aurangabad on a road lined with great banyan trees , then up a spiraling highway to Khuldabad . In this town dwelt a holy man who was Aurangzeb 's teacher . When death finally claimed the padshah in 1707 , after 49 imperial years , rupees from the sale of caps paid for what he wished a simple funeral . He lies beside his teacher . The Moguls had given India six men , mostly resolute , at times towering . Now the lineage produced weaklings . When Nadir Shah of Persia invaded in 1739 , the emperor 's forces were no match . In the vast loot he took from Delhi was the Peacock Throne . THE EAST INDIA COMPANY gradually absorbed almost all the empire . But Mogul ways continued on , even in those regions that came under British control . " I think our family 's jagir was about 700 or 800 villages , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all males of his lineage , he still bears the noble title " mir . " I met him in Hyderabad in southern India . Abandoning the sinking ship , a Mogul minister established his own dynasty in Hyderabad in the 18th century . Among the nobles he brought to his kingdom was a forebear of Mir Moazam . Like the nobility of Agra or Delhi , the first families of Hyderabad maintained troops for the kingdom 's  |p492  defense ? and still had ceremonial guards , a few hundred or a thousand to a family , as late as the 1930s . Mir Moazam remembers that on his family estate were men with swords and lances , impeccably uniformed . We visited his family 's former palace , a great rambling building on a hill . And the memories came tumbling out : the advance guard here , at the front gate , the other troops drawn up at present arms on the upper terrace when important visitors arrived . On one side of the hill were the tracks of a @#  |p493  small railroad . " My uncles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting , " Mir Moazam said . " A full-size tiger , stuffed , would go down the hill on the tracks , and they 'd let fly : bang ! bang ! bang ! " The tiger would be hauled up , patched up , then sent careening down again . When Hyderabad was absorbed into India , after independence in 1947 , jagirs were abolished . Mir Moazam 's family sold its palace , which has become government office space . A reedy wistfulness crept into his voice as we came on what was once a garden . He remembered bands playing here . The pool held stagnant water , half solid ; motorbikes were parked amid straggling bougainvillea . " It was n't ugly like this , " he said . Times change . Gardens become bedraggled , precious stones disappear from inlays . But the Mogul legacy has not vanished . It remains as an aura , a state of mind , a tongue , a taste ? and one man 's memory of his family 's palace guard .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
