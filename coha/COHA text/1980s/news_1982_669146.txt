Just after dawn , a tall , white rocket - not owned by any government - roars into space with a valuable payload. // No , it ' s not the beginning of a James Bond movie . But it could be the start of a Horatio Alger story , a story about US private enterprise making money in space. // Spurred by European and Japanese competition for the lucrative satellite-launching market , several US companies are vying for a slice of the action. // And while it ' s still early to predict the long-term potential for the involvement of private enterprise in space , experts in business and government agree growth is inevitable. // In the future , the ' ' private sector is going to be taking over a larger and larger share of the activities in space , while government ' s share will become less and less , ' ' says Larry Wolken , a specialist in the economic development of space at the Center for Education and Research in Free Enterprise at Texas A &; M University. // David Hannah Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately launched satellite into orbit in 1984. // Mr. Hannah , the chairman of Space Services Inc. of America ( SSI ) , took a big step toward that goal last week . His Houston-based firm launched a rocket - Conestoga I ( see photo ) - made from surplus parts on a 101/2-minute flight. // Blastoff came just two months before the US space shuttle is scheduled to make its first attempt at placing satellites in orbit. // Besides Hannah ' s Space Services , several other firms are said to be interested in entering the private rocket-launching market . At the same time , the New Jersey firm Space Transportation Company has offered to fund a shuttle dedicated to private uses . Still other firms are interested in providing ground services for the shuttle operation. // Says Mr. Hannah of his firm ' s first successful launch , ' ' It was like winning a football game . But we realize the real job is still in front of us. ' ' // Buoyed by its new-found credibility , his company is now searching for a permanent launch site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii . The firm is also negotiating with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) to lease launch-pad space at Cape Canaveral to shoot its heftiest payloads into high orbit. // Another space entrepreneur and president of Space Transportation Company , Klaus Heiss , proposes to buy a $1 billion space shuttle from Rockwell International that would be financed by private investors. // NASA currently plans to fund four shuttles . Under the proposed agreement , Dr. Heiss ' s shuttle would provide a fifth orbiter to be handed over to NASA in return for the right to sell cargo space on the US shuttle fleet to foreign and commercial users. // Details of the agreement haven ' t been ironed out , but the fifth shuttle would be dedicated to commercial uses . ( Both NASA and the US Air Force are in favor of adding a fifth shuttle to the fleet. ) // Looking ahead 10 or 12 years , Heiss says , the real economic test of the US space program will come when space transportation gets private financing. // ' ' History shows that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money where their mouth is , ' ' says Heiss , who directed an independent economic analysis of the shuttle program in the early 1970s that was used to help sell Congress on the program. // Heiss says five shuttles are required to make the system turn a profit . Also needed , he says , is a coherent structure for marketing the services the shuttle will provide . Otherwise , he warns , the Europeans and Japanese could snatch up the lion ' s share of the commercial satellite-launching market. // Heiss predicts that up to 200 large communications satellites for civilian uses will be in orbit by 1995 . This translates into a potential worldwide market worth approximately $30 billion , he says , half of which could be up for competitive grabs. // ' ' The Europeans did exactly what the US should have done a long time ago - set up a commercial organization to market launch services for satellites , ' ' says Heiss. // Those pushing for US private business involvement are quick to thump a fist on a major report from the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found that foreign competition is beginning to threaten US leadership in commercially profitable space technology. // With the shuttle ' s timetable and cargo charges still up in the air , the report says US businesses have already bought satellite-launch services from the European Space Agency ' s Ariane program. // The Ariane is expected to be turned over to a consortium of private companies and banks , called Arianespace , in 1986 . It has firm orders worth about $400 million to loft 24 satellites over the next three years and is in the midst of negotiating other deals. // However , Ariane ' s European backers got a cold slap last week when their first satellite launch fizzled , 14 minutes after the rocket blasted off from the coast of South America. // The Japanese , while a less immediate concern to the US , are also working toward the day when they ' ll market satellite-launching services - possibly as early as the late 1980s. // Hannah of SSI says that part of the importance of his company ' s activities is the effect they may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ' ' We ' ve established a path through the government regulations , ' ' he says , predicting federal regulations of private launches are less than two years away. // One industry observer says at least two other firms besides SSI are keeping a hungry eye on the commercial satellite-launching market , although SSI is by far in the domestic lead . NASA officials say more than a dozen companies are jockeying for tighter proprietary relationships of various sorts with the US space agency . Not all of these firms are hankering to buy shuttles or build their own rockets. // ' ' A lot of these companies are brand new , ' ' says Ronald Philips , director of technology utilization in NASA ' s industry affairs office . ' ' They ' re coming into this to take part in low-gravity experiments or the space transportation system. ' ' // Some firms are offering to handle toxic fuels and prepare cargoes for the shuttle. // ' ' In some cases we already have agreements to do some work or cooperate in some way with companies , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a joint-venture arrangement with Johnson &; Johnson and NASA to fly low-gravity pharmaceutical manufacturing experiments aboard six shuttle flights. // Private-sector interest is starting to take off at this point , says Philips . ' ' As people perceive the feasibility of space transportation , they ' re realizing ways of becoming involved. ' ' // NASA officials seem eager to see private enterprise move forward onto what was once strictly government turf. // ' ' We ' ve gotten a lot of help from NASA , ' ' says Space Service ' s Hannah . Last year the firm hoped to try a test launch , but a valve froze during a preflight test and the rocket blew up on the launch pad . A consultant from NASA advised SSI to switch from liquid to more stable solid-fuel engines. // The Reagan administration , for its part , has endorsed the idea of commercial involvement in space . In a policy statement issued this summer , President Reagan called for ' ' a climate conducive to expanded private-sector investment and involvement in space activities. ' ' // Sen. Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronaut and a Senate gadfly on space issues , says he thinks the President is holding back on making a stronger space policy because of ' ' preoccupation with the budgetary problems. ' ' // He says , ' ' Clearly , you won ' t have the private sector operating your defense programs in space , but beyond that , I don ' t think it ' s clear what the limitations are. ' ' // Congress itself has made low passes at various pieces of legislation relating to US space policy and the private sector . One bill , introduced by Sen. Howard Cannon ( D ) of Nevada , would establish regulations for rocket launches by private companies. // ' ' It was introduced mainly for discussion purposes , ' ' says one senior staffer for the Senate Commerce Committee . ' ' We have no immediate intention of pushing it. ' ' // The key attraction of private rocket services is the ability to tailor launches to fit commercial needs . In addition , private firms are able to make quicker decisions and market their wares more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The government just isn ' t set up to do that , ' ' says Mark Chartrand , executive director of the National Space Institute , a citizens-advocacy space organization that favors greater private-sector involvement in space. // NASA administrator James Beggs ' ' can ' t even take a potential customer to lunch - it ' s against the law , ' ' says Mr. Chartrand. // In the case of Space Services , though , personalized attention won ' t be cheap . It will cost between $3 million to $5 million for SSI to offer the same launching services the space shuttle will offer for less than half as much. // //
