Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier may have dreamed up modernist architecture in Europe during the 1920s , but it took architects of the next generation , working in the wide-open , up-and-at-'em Western hemisphere , to make European functionalism a ubiquitous International Style during the 1950s and ' 60s . Two of the most fluent and influential New World apostles were the U.S. 's Gordon Bunshaft and Brazil 's Oscar Niemeyer . This week in Chicago the two unrepentant old modernists will share the tenth annual Pritzker Architecture Prize . The Pritzker is by far the field 's most prestigious award and , with its $100,000 honorarium , the most generous . The tribute , says Bunshaft , " is the nicest thing that ever happened to me . " <P> The prize has never before been shared , but the pairing seems apt . Both Niemeyer , 80 , and Bunshaft , 79 , are really being honored for their pioneering work of 25 and 35 years ago . Bunshaft is the Miesian . As the chief design partner at New York City 's Skidmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950s and early ' 60s of humane , impeccable **26;9518;TOOLONG office towers , among the best built anywhere . Niemeyer is the prolific Corbusian , a quirkier and more perilously romantic builder of singular , often bombastic objects  --  most notably the major public buildings of Brasilia , the utopistic Brazilian capital built all at once between 1957 and 1963 . <P> Both men designed buildings for the 1939 New York World 's Fair . Bunshaft conceived his best and best-known work , Manhattan 's Lever House , just as the United Nations headquarters , designed in large part by Niemeyer , was going up a few blocks southeast . Both men were the quintessentially Establishment architects of their generation . And , with success , both tended toward mannerism , became immune to tempering influences and got carried away with the thrills of go-go grandiosity . <P> Both , too , were profoundly out of fashion for most of the 1970s and ' 80s , during the era of ferocious antimodernist reaction . But now the pendulum is swinging back again , which may account for this week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither prizewinner is interested in making a pretense of mellowness . In the acceptance speech he prepared for his daughter to read , Niemeyer disparaged a " minor architecture made with a ruler and square " and , a bit self-servingly , endorsed the " search for the spectacular . " The more plainspoken Bunshaft dismisses apostates and revels in his sense of vindication . " I think the committee is saying that modern architecture is pretty good , " he reckons . " Young architects are turning away from postmodernism , and I think they 're going to turn toward precision even more than modernism did . It 'll make Lever House look like a sentimental old lady .
