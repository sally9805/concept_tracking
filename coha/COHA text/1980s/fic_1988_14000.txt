Tom , the stage manager , wearing jeans , boots and a down vest , is putting down some strips of masking tape on the floor . He works in silence , as Abraham enters . He is quite handsome and fit . You would not for one moment , think that this man was anything on earth but an actor . ABRAHAM Hey there . TOM Cold enough for you ? ABRAHAM Tell me about it . Anything I can do there ? TOM I 'm fine . Where 's Kitty ? ( Abraham takes off his coat and muffler . ) ABRAHAM Giving an interview at the Journal . I think . Or maybe it 's one of the TV stations . Why ?

She flew in front L.A. last night . ABRAHAM What did you say to her , " Hey , Monica , why do n't you give up your fabulous film deal and come back to your old company and work for nothing ? " p. 4 JACK Just about . She does n't start shooting again til summer . Why should n't she come ? ABRAHAM Is she getting top billing or Kitty ? JACK Kitty will , of course , but that 's what I ( Sees that Tom is listening. ) wanted to talk to you about . ABRAHAM Me ? JACK ( He draws him aside somewhat . ) I mean , I think your work has been real interesting lately .

But you 're gon na have to do whatever I say , O.K. ? ABRAHAM Oh , man . And Kitty 's playing Sarah ? JACK That 's right . And Monica will play your mistress , but you 'll be the one we 're watching . I mean , who do we remember from this story . Sarah ? No . Hagar ? No . Abraham . Yes . Abraham the Patriarch .

SARAH What time ? ( Tom is stunned by her lack of excitement . He looks at Abraham , who has an I-told-you-so look . ) TOM Ten . SARAH Thanks , Tom .

A real stand up cup of Joe . ( Sarah turns to Jack . ) SARAH So , Jack . Why are we doing a Bible story ? People hate the Bible . JACK Not if you 're in it , they wo n't . SARAH Who am I playing ?

Hi Cliff . ( She hugs Sarah . ) Sarah . That was a great review you got this morning . SARAH I 'm sleeping with them is how I do it . HAGAR Whatever works , hon. ( Jack looks up as Virginia enters . She is a little nervous , and does n't seem to know where she is . But she has a natural competence and grace that helps her cover it . ) JACK There you are .

There is another chorus of Hellos . ) JACK This is Cliff and Kitty , and Monica Mars , of course , and Tom , over there is our stage manager . ( He sees they are waiting for an explanation . ) I thought since none of us know jack shit about the Bible , we should have Virginia do the writing on this one . ( A moment . ) And I heard her speak a few weeks ago and could n't get her out of my mindso , here she is . ( Clearly , Jack has more than a professional interest in Virginia. ) p. 8 VIRGINIA I 'm so happy to be here . I 've been a big fan of this company for so long . But I do n't really know every much about the theatre . JACK It 's easy . You 'll see . We pick a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters and how the story goes .

So ( Taking her over to it. ) this is our table ( Sarah sees Abraham staring at Hagar . ) ABRAHAM ( Taking Sarah 's arm . ) Our little Monica looks pretty good , does n't she ? SARAH She certainly does . HAGAR It 's the money . JACK ( Holding Virginia 's chair . ) And until the costume designer gets here , we just pull our rehearsal clothes out of wardrobe , you know , sandals , black hair . ( Sarah wants Jack 's attention now . She comes up to him . ) SARAH Jack , maybe it would be fun if I played the maid this time , and Monica played Sarah . JACK You 're perfect for Sarah .

Tell me quick . Do I die ? VIRGINIA Night after night . JACK ( Handing out some papers . ) Ladies and Gentlemen , welcome to our humble hall . Where some night in the early spring we will pounce upon the unwitting audience with the opening of Who was Sarah , Who was Abraham , and ( Kissing Virginia on the forehead . ) What the Hell Happened to Them .

ABRAHAM Abraham was an Arab ? VIRGINIA Think of Omar Sharif . ( Abraham leaves the table , and wanders over toward the trunks and discarded furniture . ) SARAH And what did Sarah do all day ? VIRGINIA ( Looks at Jack , then answers . ) She was a High Priest . HAGAR A High Priest of what ? JACK Let 's just call it the old Mesopotamian Moon Worship . ( Abraham has found a couple of old blankets , which he has draped over an upholstered chair , to create a mound that looks like a hillside knoll . ) SARAH I did n't know that . How do we know this ? Does everybody know this ? VIRGINIA Just academics , mainly , but word is leaking out . There 's a whole canon of Sarah stories , and hundreds of thousands of coins from the time with her picture on them , and several huge statues found in the temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty , who Sarah really was is not part of our story here . It 's the Bible version we 're after . How marriage used to be . You loved this man . ( Indicating Cliff . ) You stood behind him , all the way . When God told him to move , you started packing . ( Sarah nods but does n't answer . ) ABRAHAM ( Climbing up his hillside . ) Now when God talks to me , particularly the first time , who do I think it is ? ( Jack takes some pieces of paper from Virginia . ) SARAH ( Amused . ) What are you doing ? ABRAHAM ( Enjoying himself . ) Watching my sheep . JACK Tom , can we get some copies of this ? ( Jack walks out into the playing area , looking for something to use as a prop . ) ABRAHAM And how old is Abraham now . JACK Virginia ? ABRAHAM ( Stretching out . ) Have I had my lunch ? VIRGINIA In Bible years ? ABRAHAM I 'm eating some figs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does my robe have pockets ? p. 12 SARAH Just rest , Cliff . It 's the first time you 've been in the shade all day . ( Jack sees what he was looking for , a piece of driftwood , which he hands to Abraham for use as a shepherd 's crook . ) JACK Here you go . HAGAR Jack , I have a little costume fitting at four . SARAH How little ? JACK Hey . It 's hot in the desert , O.K. ? ( Then to Hagar . ) Thanks , Monica . We 'll see you tomorrow . ( Hagar gathers up her things and leaves . ) ABRAHAM ( To Jack . ) And what 's going on between Abraham and Sarah right now ? JACK What do you mean ? ABRAHAM Well do n't you think they 're having some money trouble ? Or maybe things have gotten real routine in the bed or something . JACK Sure . That sounds right . ( Backs away . ) O.K. , Tom , you read God . And Abraham , you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it . ( Sarah and Virginia are whispering about something , and studying the map . ) ABRAHAM No problem . p. 13 TOM ( Reading . ) " Abraham . " ABRAHAM ( As though answering roll call . ) Here . TOM ( Reading . ) " Get thee out of thy country , away from thy kindredand unto a land that I will show you . " ABRAHAM Who is this ? TOM " Where I will make of you a great nation . Where I will bless you and make your name great . Where I will bless those who bless you , and curse those who curse you . For in your name , Abraham , will all families of the earth be blessed . " ABRAHAM ( Startled at the impact of it . ) Wow . JACK Good . You got it . He matters for a change . ABRAHAM I know . So is he really going to tell his wife , that some voice told him to move toCalifornia ? I mean , if it was me JACK It is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being broke and how about if we go to the coast for pilot season and see how we make out . You know , give her a business reason . JACK O.K. Now Sarah , darling . There he is . The love of your life . ( She nods and approaches him. ) p. 14 SARAH Abraham . ABRAHAM ( Gestures . ) Come on up . ( Sarah , not really in character yet , walks up to his hillside , stops , then sweeps her hair off her neck in a very contemporary gesture of exhaustion . ) SARAH God it 's hot out here . ( Abraham wipes his forehead with his shirtsleeve . ) ABRAHAM Yeah . It is . ( A grin . ) Let 's move . JACK ( A burst of laughter . ) I love it . ABRAHAM Thanks . SARAH Tom , can you get me a skirt ? I ca n't do this in pants . JACK ( Walks up to them . ) Now they do n't talk very often , these two . Abraham probably does n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . Sacrificing things , working with the virgins , whatever . So it 's a fairly formal relationship . ( A moment . ) Tom , what can we use for some shade ? TOM I 'll see what I can do . ( Jack and Tom search for some kind of shade as Sarah and Abraham talk . ) SARAH ( Playing with the formality . ) Greetings , husband . How are your sheep ? p. 15 ABRAHAM Not ba-a-ad . ( Sarah has to laugh and punches him affectionately . ) JACK ( To Abraham . ) Now this is a really old marriage . Maybe twenty years . VIRGINIA Forty . JACK And everything is in her name . So Abraham owes this lady . SARAH ( Getting a cup from the table . ) Oh God , do n't tell him that . JACK Why not ? SARAH Then he 'll really hate me . JACK He does n't hate you . SARAH If he owes me , he hates me . JACK O.K. now . One more time . Only let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to think about what to say . ( Jack walks over to the table and sits down with Virginia , leaving Sarah and Abraham alone in the playing area . ) SARAH ( The first hint of the Sarah voice . ) Good evening , husband . ( Abraham jumps down from his rock . ) ABRAHAM I ca n't do it . The guy may be a jerk , but he 's not stupid . A voice ? Come on . He 's not going to tell her p. 16 SARAH ( Calmly . ) Maybe Abraham does n't have to tell her . Maybe she knows he 's been thinking about something . ABRAHAM Good . SARAH It could only be two or three things . ABRAHAM Right . He 's just got to get out of there . SARAH That 's what she thought . ABRAHAM Well what choice does he have ? I mean , if Abraham does n't make his move pretty quick , he might be stuck out here forever , middle of nowhere , trading what ( He looks at Virginia. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the coast , he can get rich . SARAH Rich enough to buy another wife ? A wife that wo n't be so routine in the bed ? ABRAHAM I 'll buy you some slaves . SARAH I do n't want any slaves . ABRAHAM Anything you want then . I always wanted to buy you things , it 's just I did n't SARAH I want our life to stay the way it is . ABRAHAM It 's already changed . As soon as I started wanting something else , it was over , was n't it ? SARAH No . It 's not over til you leave me. p. 17 ABRAHAM I 'm not leaving you . All Abraham wants to do is move to the coast . SARAH Where everybody leaves everybody and nobody gives a shit . JACK Wonderful ! Right on the money . God , I had no idea this was so rich . Five minutes everybody . Virginia , are you getting all this , or should we start taping everything ? Nice work , Sarah . Really hot . ( Abraham follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think ? Will they see why God picked me ? ( Sarah takes a deep breath and walks over to Virginia . ) SARAH What did Sarah look like ? ( Virginia opens a book on the table . ) VIRGINIA There . Six feet tall and drop-dead gorgeous . SARAH What 's that ? VIRGINIA A divine cloud over her tent . One of the Sarah stories says it was there all the time , like a sign , and her doors were always open , and a light , not a candle , but a mysterious light shone day and night . SARAH So , how much does Sarah know about this coast Abraham wants to go to ? VIRGINIA She 's heard of it , I 'm sure , from the traders . But probably the only thing she knows for sure is that they 're heathen . They 're sun-worshippers. p. 18 SARAH Then why would she go with him ? VIRGINIA Mission work , maybe . Priests like Sarah were always traveling around setting up new centers of moon worship . SARAH Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I can too . Fertility , crops SARAH Mystery , romance ( And the lights dim to indicate end of scene. ) p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE III The actors now have xeroxed pages in their hands . Sarah ties on a rehearsal skirt as Tom sets up a tent-frame to one side , and drapes it with sheets of frayed canvas . Hagar stands at a wardrobe , putting on eye makeup . JACK All right , now . Virginia has finished a new scene for us , so we 'll just read through it . Real easy . Just like we did yesterday . Scene One is Abraham hears from God . Scene Two is a trader comes into the camp and describes this terrible famine creeping toward them , giving Abraham just the business reason he was looking for , and this is Scene Three . Abraham talks to Sarah . ( He motions toward the set . ) O.K. Now , Sarah 's tent will be here on a hill . ( Indicating the poles now in the set . ) Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of those long desert twilights . Plain . Campfires glowing . SARAH Children playing after supper ABRAHAM Camels and goats tied up for the night JACK It 's your standard desert tribe getting ready for bed . Abraham has finished his rounds , and he climbs the hill to find Sarah . ABRAHAM And what is she doing ? JACK Looking out at the tents . p. 20 ABRAHAM To see if I arranged them right ? SARAH She likes the way they look . JACK Tom , cue Sarah 's music . It 's your line , Abraham . ( Tom punches a tape recorder on his desk , which plays a sacred Mesopotamian melody on a primitive stringed instrument . ) ABRAHAM ( Reading from the script . ) " Sarah , my love . I have had some disturbing news from the south . A famine lies upon the land of Canaan . " SARAH " I too have heard this news . " ( Jack leans over to Virginia and whispers samething we ca n't hear . Virginia makes a note in her book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famine sweeps north , it could destroy us . " SARAH " There is no need to move , Abraham . Our God is pleased with us . Our wells are full . Our prayers will keep them full . " ABRAHAM " I would take all who dwell with us , and travel south toward the coastal trading center of ( He checks the pronunciation . ) Byblos ? Byblos ? VIRGINIA ( Saying it correctly . ) Byblos . ABRAHAM " For by entering into trade we will not have to depend on our crops an herds to feed us. " p. 21 SARAH " You would leave this land of peace and prosperity , where our store-houses are full , where we have served our God 's purpose , and wander into the land of the Philistines ? " ABRAHAM " I would stand and greet the Pharaohs when they float their barges to my shore . " SARAH " I have seen your thoughts in my dreams , Abraham . You would grow rich in the service of false gods . " ABRAHAM " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in sight of the great sea . " JACK O.K. Good . ABRAHAM This is great , Virginia . " In sight of the great sea . " JACK Let 's go on . ABRAHAM O.K. , but can I paraphrase some of this , Virginia ? It feels a little stilted . JACK It is a little stiff , love . SARAH I like it stiff . ABRAHAM You would . SARAH What 's that supposed to mean ? ABRAHAM I 'm sorry . I did n't mean " you . " That 's what Abraham is feeling . Sarah 's a prude . This is her town and he knows it . That 's why he wants to get away . They worship her here . p. 22 SARAH He knew that when he married her . ABRAHAM Well , maybe he did n't know how tired he 'd get , walking up the hill to talk to her . SARAH She 'll meet him wherever he says . It 's not her fault she 's a priestess . But the 're depending on her now . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Priestess , why does n't she quit ? SARAH Would that make him happy ? ABRAHAM She 's not interested in making him happy . SARAH Yes , she is too . ABRAHAM They why wo n't she go with him to the coast ? SARAH She does go with him to the coast , did n't you read what Virginia gave us ? ABRAHAM No , not yet . I wanted to SARAH They run smack into this famine , just like Sarah said they would . But when they get to the border , there 's problem . The Pharaoh needs a priest , they say , and he likes them pretty . So I have to hide in a basket . Then when they find me in the basket , I have to say I 'm not your wife , I 'm your sister , so they wo n't kill you . ABRAHAM O.K. Thanks . SARAH Only now that I 'm your sister , they tie me up , set me on a camel and I spend the next month in the harem . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARAH A night , a month , what difference does it make ? ( To Abraham . ) So I ask my Gods and they make it rain . But when the Pharaoh finally finds out I am your wife , not your sister , he 's so mad at what his Gods will do to him for taking me , that he gives me back to you as fast as he can , and heaps all these presents on you and gives me one of his daughters for a maid . HAGAR Yes , Ma'am ? SARAH Only by then , you 're so mad at me , for being right about we never should have come here , that you fuck this maid , and you keep fucking this maid til she gets pregnant . HAGAR And whose fault is that ? ( Sarah is so upset , she runs out of the room . ) SARAH It 's not mine , I can tell you that . JACK ( Calling after her . ) Sarah , wait . Where are you going ? SARAH I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack follows her as fast as he can , as Abraham turns to Hagar and shrugs . ) ABRAHAM What did I say ? HAGAR ( Taking off her sweater . ) Is that how the story goes , really ? p. 24 ABRAHAM I do n't think so . I mean ( Enjoying this look at her body . ) That 's not why I sleep with you , because I 'm mad at her . HAGAR I do n't care if it is . She never talks to me anyway . She never did . What does she think , it 's some kind of sin to go work in the movies ? ABRAHAM Maybe she does . HAGAR It 's not just her , either . Everybody around here feels that way . As far as I can tell , you 're the only one who 's looking at me and seeing a real person . ABRAHAM You 're a beautiful woman . HAGAR So if it 's comfort you 're offering me , Abraham , I 'm not going to turn you down . ABRAHAM I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we believe in treating people nice . ABRAHAM Even men ? HAGAR Especially men . ( Abraham , slightly uncomfortable , turns to Virginia . ) ABRAHAM What 's going on ? Is Jack coming back ? VIRGINIA I do n't know . ABRAHAM Well , look , it 's almost five o'clock , anyway . I 'm leaving . p. 25 HAGAR Yeah . Me too . ( To Abraham . ) Can you drop me off at the Oyster ? ABRAHAM Sure . ( Hagar and Abraham put on their coats and prepare to leave as the lights dim . ) HAGAR Did you ever think about doing a movie ? ABRAHAM Well , sure I thought about it . HAGAR You 'd be great . ABRAHAM I 'd love to do a movie . ( They go out the door . Jack enters from another door . ) JACK Where 'd everybody go ? VIRGINIA They went to the Oyster . They said rehearsal was over . JACK Goddamn him . VIRGINIA Who , Cliff ? JACK Do you find him attractive ? ( Then quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he 's attractive . Is n't that why you cast him ? JACK Let 's get you back to the hotel , what do you say ? ( Lights change or dim for the end of the scene. ) p. 26 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE IV Sarah and Jack are alone in the room . SARAH Are you mad at me ? JACK Of course not . Why should I be mad at you ? SARAH I thought we were doing something last night . JACK Jesus . I 'm sorry . I got talking with Virginia and SARAH I just feel so I mean , when the only time I see you is in rehearsal , II miss you . JACK I 'm sorry , sweetheart . Can we do it tonight ? We 'll drive out to Harry 's and drink them all under the bar , what do you think ? SARAH I think they 're probably all still under the bar from the last time we were at Harry 's . JACK Damn right they are . SARAH It 's all right . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really beat lately . But what I wanted to say wasI feel like you 're not on my side . You 're making Sarah this imperious bitch who lords it over everybody . JACK No , you 're just feeling like an imperious bitch because that 's who Sarah was . SARAH She was not . Everything she did was for somebody else . p. 27 JACK I 'm sorry about our date . Can we do it tonight ? SARAH No , that 's all right . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . Maybe it 's Monica . ( Virginia enters . ) JACK It always was Monica , as I remember . ( He kisses her . ) Virginia , Kitty thinks we 're making Sarah too pushy . SARAH What if we had a scene between Sarah and the Pharaoh in the harem ? Where Sarah gets to dance or something . JACK The audience does n't care about the Pharaoh . And she did n't sleep with him . Right , Virginia ? VIRGINIA No , all they did was perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? VIRGINIA No , that 's him sleeping with your virgins while you watch . SARAH For what ? VIRGINIA Rain . JACK She was celibate , O.K. ? Priests could have households and husbands , but no sex . SARAH She was in the harem for a month . Jack . Who knows what happened ? Are you afraid the audience wo n't like me if I 've had a lover ? I mean , I know Abraham did n't want her . But the Pharaoh was a different kind of man . He was n't afraid of her power . Maybe he even got off on it . Sarah would 've liked that . p. 28 JACK I 'm sure she would . SARAH So what if she risked herself for once ? Would that be so terrible ? Sarah spends an evening with an elegant stranger ? Someone with some charm ? Talking about something other than sheep ? Lifting a glass , forgetting who she was , sinking backward , her robe slipping off her shoulders ? ( Turns to Virginia . ) Would it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be so bad . JACK It would be horrible . How could we believe in her after that ? What is the problem here ? SARAH My problem is , Abraham falls in love with that little whore and it 's not fair . JACK Go on . SARAH This girl 's not like all the others . Could n't Sarah just have one happy scene before she loses her husband to this Hagar ? JACK All what others ? SARAH Darling director , my husband has had every virgin in the valley . JACK Physically . Yes . He has wives and children in the village . But that does n't mean Abraham loved these women . He probably just did n't want to hurt their feelings . p. 29 SARAH Keep up the morale , you mean . JACK It 's you he loves . You an you alone . SARAH It 's O.K. , Jack . JACK It 's not O.K. You 're a beautiful woman . The most beautiful woman he 's ever seen . From the first moment he saw you SARAH Please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was not free , that his passion for you was SARAH ( Amused . ) All right . We get the idea . JACK It 's more than an idea . He loves who you are and what you can do . There 's not a woman in the world who could compare to you . SARAH He has said that . JACK All he wants is to spend the rest of his life with you . Protect you , care for you , give you everything you need . SARAH O.K. Yes . I mean , he does still live with me , so that 's something . JACK He is yours , Kitty . Yours alone . SARAH ( Carefully . ) I think he 's already sleeping with her . JACK Absolutely not . I would know it if he was .

ABRAHAM Right here . Tomatoes and lettuce . JACK He has n't slept with her . He has n't even seen her . She 's your property . You made rain , and the Pharaoh gave you his little girl to say thanks . ( He takes the sandwich . ) O.K. ? ( He takes a bite . ) And Abraham got some gifts too , some camels , some ( Struggling to think of them. ) camel blankets , some camel saddles , some drivers , some food for the camels , a couple of camels ' hair coats , and the weight of twelve big camels in solid gold bars . ( Jack looks around at the group . ) All right ? SARAH He gets the money , and I get the maid . JACK And then SARAH And then he gets the maid .

The audience is n't going to know we did n't speak the same language . JACK What would you say ? SARAH It would n't matter what I said . It would just give us some way to HAGAR Get to know each other ? Borrow each other 's clothes ? SARAH It does n't have to be so ugly . HAGAR It 's not ugly . I 'm a slave , for God 's sake . Let me be one . JACK Tom , read the narrator again , please . SARAH Are we actually having a narrator or not ? JACK Maybe . Go Tom . ( As Tom reads , Abraham walks into the playing area , wearing a calf-length robe , tying a rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible. )  --  And when the famine had ended , Abraham took his wife Sarah and the slave girl and all who had been with him in Egypt , and his nephew Lot , and dwelt in Bethel , in Canaan.  --  ( Abraham comes to stand beside Tom . ) TOM  --  And Abraham walked with Lot to the top of a hill from which they beheld the plain of Jordan .  --  ABRAHAM " Choose which lands thou wouldst have , for thy family .

TOM  --  And Lot saw that the plain of Jordan was well supplied with water and so chose him that part , setting his tents toward Sodom .  --  ( Tom keeps reading , but goes back to his table and sits down . ) TOM  --  And when Lot had departed , the Lord spoke to Abraham saying  --  ABRAHAM  --  Lift up your eyes , to the north , the south , to the east and the west .

I have sent for my scribe , and would take counsel with her . " ( Sarah walks away , leaving Abraham and Hagar alone . ) JACK Thanks . SARAH Would I really leave them alone ? JACK You 're not afraid of a slave girl . And even if you are , you 're certainly not going to show it , O.K. ? ( The melody Hagar was humming before , now returns played on a flute or other primitive stringed instrument . Sarah stands near Virginia just outside of the playing area , her arms wrapped tightly around her chest. ) p. 35 SARAH It 's all over , is n't it . From the first moment he sees her . VIRGINIA Pretty much . ( Sarah watches intently as Jack talks Hagar and Abraham through their blocking . ) ) JACK All right , Hagar . Back up , then bow , then kneel .

JACK ( Realizes the seriousness . ) Try it , Virginia . Tom , you take notes . Abraham and Hagar , off to the side please .

( Sarah and Virginia take their original positions . ) VIRGINIA Yes , my Lord . You sent for me . SARAH My husband , Abraham , would take the Egyptian girl , Hagar to his bed . VIRGINIA ( Looks up from her writing . ) Send her away , my Lord . She is not respectful of our ways . SARAH I can not . I fear that Abraham would follow her . VIRGINIA Then you must let him go .

VIRGINIA He has children in the valley . And women to serve him . SARAH He would have his own child in his own house . VIRGINIA And where is it written that a man shall have his own child in his own house ? SARAH ( Holds up her hand for Virginia to stop . ) Such a law does not have to be written . VIRGINIA But as a High Priest , you can not bear his child . SARAH No . But I could take their child as my own , could I not ? VIRGINIA Yes , that is your right .

SARAH ( Seems especially moved . ) Thanks , sweetheart . I love you too . JACK O.K. team . Everybody that 's not involved in that hug , can go home . But Abraham ( Abraham breaks out of the embrace with Sarah . ) JACK Could I see you for a minute ? ( Abraham looks quickly over to Hagar . ) ABRAHAM Ca n't do it now , Jack . ( Abraham realizes everybody is looking at him . Sarah has seen this glance at Hagar , and so has Jack . ) ABRAHAM I promised Paul I 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all know this is a lie . ) JACK How about after the show tonight ? ABRAHAM Ca n't do that either . How about Friday before rehearsal ? JACK Good . Ten-thirty , then . Coupla things I want to talk to you about . ( Lights dim or change for end of scene. ) p. 44 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE VI Jack is pacing . Cliff is waiting . Virginia sits quietly . JACK Old Sarah 's a smart girl . ABRAHAM No kidding . JACK So what does she see in you ? ABRAHAM I never thought about it . JACK She should dump you so fast . ABRAHAM Because of Hagar , you mean . JACK You 're not even trying to hide it ! ABRAHAM This is not like other marriages , Jack . It 's more like a little corporation . We 're business partners , Sarah and me . What I do on my time is my business . JACK I see that , I do , it 's just this problem with the audience . ABRAHAM What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hate me ? JACK Yeah . It looks like you used Sarah 's influence to get rich , and then you dumped her for a piece of Egyptian tail . ABRAHAM Not on purpose I did n't . It 's in the script . JACK I give up . p. 45 ABRAHAM What ? If it 's about my work , just tell me . Maybe you 'd like a little more nobility . JACK What I 'd like is a little more respect for your wife . ABRAHAM ( Getting out his notebook . ) O.K. JACK I mean , Sarah is funny and smart , so you would n't be making it all up , right ? ABRAHAM Abraham loves Sarah , Jack . He always has . It 's just time for her to lose one . JACK It 's more than one she 's losing . ABRAHAM O.K. She 's losing the whole thing . But nobody gets to stay on top forever . JACK That 's as wrong as it can be . Abraham does not have attitude , Cliff . Now please . The audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stay out of their way . ABRAHAM ( Taking a note . ) No attitude . VIRGINIA I need to make a call . ( He nods to her and she leaves . ) JACK Good . Now . Let 's go on to Hagar . What do you want from her ? ABRAHAM Sex . JACK Just sex ? p. 46 ABRAHAM No it 's not just sex . It 's sex the way I like it . Right ? JACK No . That 's not enough . ABRAHAM O.K. , then . How about how much money I could make in Egypt as Hagar 's husband ? JACK Ca n't you have some passion for the girl ? ABRAHAM Passion . JACK I want you obsessed with her . You ca n't think of anything else . Night and day , you smell her perfume , you hear her sigh , you feel her fresh young limbs wrapped around you . ABRAHAM ( Making a note . ) Sure . JACK Because the audience see , the audience can forgive you passion . ABRAHAM Yeah , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loves his God and follows his orders , and he loves these two women , one a priest , and the other a slave . Now that 's a story we can sell . ABRAHAM You 're doing a helluva job on this . Does that about take care of it ? JACK Unless you have some idea what this God sees in you . ABRAHAM I do what he says , that 's what it is . God 's going to make me the father of millions , and I 'm going to give him all the credit . p. 47 JACK O.K. , then . Be nice to Sarah . ABRAHAM I miss talking to her . JACK What a great idea . ABRAHAM Thanks . JACK Try to find a moment to show us that . Where are you off to ? ABRAHAM Monica gave me this agent 's name to call . You ever thought about films ? JACK From time to time . ( Abraham goes out the door , as Sarah is coming in . ) ABRAHAM Hi . SARAH Cliff , could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Cliff leaves and Kitty walks on into the room . ) JACK What was all that about ? SARAH Cliff has moved out . I guess . He has n't been home for a week . JACK Is that so bad ? SARAH I do n't know . Maybe it is , maybe it is n't . JACK What do you mean ? SARAH I 'm pregnant . ( Jack is stunned . But he knows enough to be enthusiastic. ) p. 48 JACK Kitty . That 's wonderful . A baby ! SARAH I know . It 's the strangest feeling . JACK Uh . Have you and Cliff SARAH Do I know whether it 's his baby or yours ? No . I do n't . JACK Kitty , we only had that one ( He stops . ) And that 's all it takes . Jesus . ( He stops . ) What are you going to do ? SARAH Well , I think we can pretty much tell what your response is . JACK Kitty , please ( Virginia walks back in with Hagar . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VIRGINIA Thanks . TOM Jack , do you want me to schedule those auditions for this afternoon ? JACK So , what do you think , folks ? Should we cast somebody as God and have him walk around like he was really there , or what ? SARAH What do we need God for if we 've got you ? ( And as Virginia laughs , the lights change for the end of the scene. ) p. 49 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE VII Abraham and Sarah are pacing , going over their lines . Hagar is standing in the center of the playing area , as Tom helps her adjust the pregnant padding under her sweater . She is cranky and uncooperative . TOM How 's that ? HAGAR God , I forgot how repulsive this pregnant get-up was . ABRAHAM ( With a wink in his voice . ) There are some of us who find it very attractive . JACK ( Furious at him . ) Oh , for God 's sake , Abraham . Can we just do the scene ? SARAH The scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagar , kneels down in the center of the playing area , picks up her script from the floor . ) HAGAR The scene is bullshit . JACK Some time has gone by . Hagar is pregnant , but one night , Sarah yelled at her , and she freaked out and ran away from camp . So this is what happens when the men bring her back . Abraham , you start . ( Abraham clears his throat , then goes to stand by the kneeling Hagar . ) ABRAHAM ( Reading . ) " Hagar begs your forgiveness , my love , for running away , and for cursing you in public . She asks that you punish her in front of the entire household , so they may learn from the error of her ways . " ( Sarah comes a step closer. ) p. 50 SARAH " And she promises to behave toward me with respect ? " ABRAHAM " She does . " SARAH " I would hear this promise from her lips . " ABRAHAM " Say to the lady , " HAGAR ( Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This scene is bullshit ! I am not some whining little slut who 'd run off into the desert just because Sarah yelled at me . JACK Actually , darling , I 'm afraid you are right now . But by the end of the play HAGAR And Virginia has n't got a clue how hard it is to be a slut . VIRGINIA That 's true . HAGAR How can Sarah be mad at me for getting pregnant ? Is n't that why she gave me to him ? SARAH I 'm doing everything I can to make you comfortable . HAGAR I 'm pregnant , darling . I 'm not going to be comfortable . SARAH I 've even given you your own tent . HAGAR With a fucking guard outside it night and day . SARAH In case you need anything . HAGAR Great . Tell him to bring me three weeks worth of food and water and a camel . p. 51 JACK Virginia , can Sarah let Hagar go ? VIRGINIA No , she ca n't . It would be a major diplomatic embarrassment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert , because you might lose the baby . HAGAR And once I have the baby , there 'll be some other reason I ca n't leave , wo n't there ? Like the slave traders will swoop down on me and steal him . SARAH Is n't this what the script says , you despise me ? HAGAR I 'm a prisoner here ! You 're using me to hold onto your husband . SARAH If you would make an effort to learn our language , you might have something to do other than wait for my husband 's visits . HAGAR Abraham is eighty-six years old . Do you think we have a good time in my tent ? SARAH Well , you should 've thought of that before you went after him . HAGAR I 'm sorry , Ma'am . But your husband did n't take going after , he only took holding still for . SARAH Of all the goddamn ABRAHAM ( To Hagar . ) Please , darling , maybe you should p. 52 JACK Do n't call her darling ! ABRAHAM ( Turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . JACK Hagar . HAGAR My name is Monica . JACK Abraham loves you . But you ca n't leave the camp before the baby is born . HAGAR Why not ? JACK Because if Sarah does n't adopt the boy , then he wo n't be legitimate . HAGAR I do n't care whether he 's legitimate or not ! JACK Well , Abraham does . This is the baby the voice told him he would have . This baby will grow up to be Ishmael , the ancestor of Mohammed , the founder of Islam . HAGAR I do n't care who he grows up to be . I ca n't say these lines . ABRAHAM Are there particular lines you 're JACK Abraham , shut up . HAGAR Do n't you know what 's going to happen to this baby when I have it ? Sarah is going to take him away ! Here she stands , everybody treating her like some kind of goddess , and all the time , she 's planning to steal my child . ( Tearing off her pregnant padding . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except screwed ? p. 53 SARAH ( Wearily . ) Would you rather I just kill you ? HAGAR Why do n't you just do this play without me . JACK We ca n't . SARAH If you wo n't say the lines , we 'll have to . This is the theatre . HAGAR ( And she turns to leave . ) This is your theatre , Sarah . And every show is your show . Well , I say , the hell with you . JACK No ! Monica ! HAGAR What ! SARAH Jack JACK Monica , I 've got an idea . HAGAR ( Getting her coat from the piles . ) Tell it to my manager . I 'm leaving . JACK ( An offering . ) How about a new scene where ( She stops . ) JACK if you 'll go back and apologize to Sarah , God will give you whatever you want . SARAH I thought we weren't having a God . JACK Virginia , can Abraham VIRGINIA ( Thinking quickly . ) Yes , he could . The Bible says an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 54 JACK Great . Abraham will come find you . HAGAR And say what ? JACK And say whatever you want . HAGAR I want to go home . JACK I know we can work this out . SARAH But why should we ? Is she the last whore in the world ? ABRAHAM She 's the last one whose father is King of Egypt . SARAH What does that mean ? ABRAHAM It means she 's good for business . ( Sarah turns away in contempt . ) ABRAHAM You remember business . JACK Virginia . What does Hagar want ? VIRGINIA It 's something for Ishmael . HAGAR What for Ishmael ? VIRGINIA You want a promise that Ishmael wo n't have to worship the moon . HAGAR Yeah . It 's weird to worship the moon . VIRGINIA You want him to follow you religion , not Sarah 's . HAGAR Keep talking . VIRGINIA When Abraham learns you ran away , he goes out into the desert and finds you , and promises you that Ishmael can worship the sun instead of the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy circumcised , like your brothers and your father in Egypt . p. 55 HAGAR And what else . VIRGINIA And himself too . Abraham has to circumcise himself too . HAGAR And what else . VIRGINIA ( Ca n't think of anything else . ) And all the men in the tribe . HAGAR Okay . That 's good . It means I stand for something . ABRAHAM It 's great . It 's exactly what we were missing . JACK And you 'll come back ? VIRGINIA ( Quietly . ) Amazing . HAGAR I 'll come back . VIRGINIA I bet that 's exactly the way it happened . JACK O.K. , then . That 's what we 'll do . HAGAR ( Putting her coat back on the hook . ) And I can apologize real good to Sarah . Wash her feet or something . SARAH ( Frosty . ) That wo n't be necessary . ( There is complete silence . Sarah puts on her coat . ) JACK O.K. , everybody . I guess that 's all , until Virginia gets this written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain this circumcision business ? JACK I do n't know . SARAH It 's easy . Abraham just climbs up to my tent one day and says , " I 'm living with Hagar now and she 's got this thing about my dick . " ( And with that , she heads for the door . ) ( Jack motions behind her back for Hagar to say something to Sarah . ) HAGAR ( Walks over to Sarah . ) Look , I 'm sorry I made such a scene . My real problem isyou 're so damn good . It 's why I left the company in the first place . I mean , you 're a real actor . I 'm just an entertainer . You 've got all this wisdom and power , and all I 've got is good legs . SARAH ( Seems disoriented . ) It 's just a difference in the way we work . I 'm real technical , and you 're HAGAR Hollywood trash . SARAH No , that 's not what I was going to say . You 're O.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody wants . Even me . I would give just about anything for a little entertainment right now . ( To Jack . ) You 're through with me for today , right ? JACK Sure . p. 57 SARAH See you at half-hour . ( And there is a half-hearted chorus of Yeah , Bye , etc. , and Sarah leaves the room . ) HAGAR ( To Virginia . ) I hope I did n't hurt your feelings . VIRGINIA You had to . I had n't been paying much attention to you . HAGAR To Hagar , you mean . VIRGINIA Hagar is the only woman in the Bible that God ever talked to directly , you know . HAGAR Well , maybe you 'll put that in somewhere . ( Jack jerks Abraham aside . ) JACK Are you a complete fool ? Do n't you see what you 've done ? ABRAHAM What ? JACK You treated Sarah like shit . So she treated Hagar like shit , and now we all have to get circumcised . ( A moment . ) You promised me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess it did n't work for me . JACK It did n't work for you ? All right , Cliff . Fine . ( Abraham takes Hagar 's arm , completely unruffled by his conversation with Jack . ) ABRAHAM Ready , love ? p. 58 HAGAR ( Taking his arm . ) Yes , sir . VIRGINIA ( Trying to help . ) Jack . How about some lunch ? JACK What ? VIRGINIA You know . What God did in the middle of the day . JACK Sure . ( After Abraham and Hagar leave , Jack turns to Virginia . ) JACK Do you see what 's happening ? He 's forgotten who gave him this fucking part . He thinks it 's all him , he thinks this whole thing is working because of him . ( Slowly and bitterly . ) Well , I know how to fix that . ( Virginia says nothing and the lights go to black. ) @x A single light comes up on Abraham . Sarah sits at the table . Jack calls out from the shadows . JACK Cliff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ham sandwich in my bag . I ordered meatloaf , they gave me ham . JACK You do n't want it ? ABRAHAM I hate ham . It 's bad for you . There ought a be a law against it . ( Jack gets the sandwich from Abraham 's bag . ) JACK Thanks . O.K. , guys . Scene Eight . ( Abraham looks at Sarah , then speaks to Jack . ) ABRAHAM I talk to you outside a minute ? JACK What about ? ABRAHAM Kitty , do you mind ? Jack and I need to JACK What ? ABRAHAM You want to talk about it with her here ? JACK Talk about what ? ( Abraham looks at them , then ca n't restrain himself . ) ABRAHAM My wife is pregnant , right ? p. 60 JACK Yes , she is . ABRAHAM Then why does n't she say anything to me about it ? ( Jack takes a moment to have a drink of his coffee , and purposefully puts his response in Bible terms . ) JACK It 's God who tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent one day ABRAHAM Yeah , I know , I looked it up . I made him some lunch and he told me Sarah was going to have a baby . JACK Yes . ABRAHAM But do n't you think she would say something to me about this ? My wife is having a baby . I 'm her husband and she 's having a baby . JACK Yes , I do . I think you should talk about it . ABRAHAM Thank you . JACK Would you like her to start ? ABRAHAM Yes , I would . Abraham , I 'm having a SARAH Abraham , I 'm having a baby . ABRAHAM O.K. SARAH Fine . ABRAHAM So who is the father of this baby ? And do n't say it 's me , because Abraham is a hundred years old . SARAH It 's God . p. 61 ABRAHAM It is not . God ca n't have any children . He 's in heaven . SARAH God does what he feels like , Abraham . One day he 's with you , the next day he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's with you all the time only you do n't get how . ( Abraham ca n't stay in the story . ) ABRAHAM Is it my baby ? SARAH I do n't know , Abraham . Maybe it is . Maybe it is n't . You 're living with a slave girl anyway . What do you care ? ABRAHAM You 're my wife ! SARAH Oh please . After all the women you 've had over the years , where do you get off telling me I ca n't have an affair and have a baby . ABRAHAM All right . SARAH ( Thinks that 's the end of it . ) O.K. , then . ABRAHAM So whose baby is it ? JACK  --  And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said , and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken , and Sarah conceived .  --  ( Tom enters . Abraham goes back to talking in Bible terms . ) ABRAHAM No . God is my friend . Now what about that Abimelech character ? That 's the father of this baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these religious rituals with . Only now we find out there 's nothing religious about it . She 's just fucking them . p. 62 JACK Cliff ABRAHAM Only this time she got caught . Did n't she . SARAH No , that was n't it at all . ABRAHAM ( But he ca n't stay in Bible terms . ) Goddamn you . And I trusted you too . I thought you loved me . SARAH I do love you . JACK She raises this child as your son . ABRAHAM You do n't want a child . SARAH I always wanted a child . ABRAHAM Then why did n't you say that ? SARAH I wanted to tell you , but you were n't home . ( Virginia enters . Abraham goes back to speaking in Bible terms . ) ABRAHAM So what am I supposed to do now ? Go back and live with Sarah and raise God 's child ? JACK Maybe you are . I do n't know . ABRAHAM Does Sarah want a divorce ? SARAH No . She does n't . ABRAHAM Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . She ca n't marry God . p. 63 SARAH She does n't want to . VIRGINIA She 'd never see him . JACK We have to get started . Where 's Monica ? HAGAR ( As she enters . ) Waiting in the hall . JACK All right , then . Abraham and Hagar center stage for Scene Eight . God tells Abraham that Sarah is having a child . Read please , Tom . ( Abraham meets Hagar at the center of the stage and puts his arm around her . ) TOM And Hagar bore Abraham a son , and Abraham called his son 's name , Ishmael . And when Ishmael was thirteen years old ( Abraham addresses Sarah directly . And this time , he does n't care who hears what . ) ABRAHAM This is a joke , right ? You 're not really pregnant . SARAH Cliff , it is perfectly obvious that you are capable of meeting somebody and changing your life . I can do the same-damn thing . ( Pause . ) Or did you think I was blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach for a Kleenex and watch you leave me ? ( Jack tries to get them back to the story . ) JACK Sarah will be the mother of nations . p. 64 ABRAHAM ( Turning to Jack . ) No , no . God said Hagar would be the mother of nations . JACK He changed his mind . Maybe he did n't like how Ishmael turned out . Hear the word of the Lord . ( He opens a Bible. )  --  Sarah shall bear thee a son . And I will establish my covenant with him and with his seed after him .  --  HAGAR Ask him , Abraham . What about my son . JACK What 's his name again ? ABRAHAM Ishmael . JACK ( Looking at the Bible . ) I will multiply him exceedingly . ABRAHAM ( To Jack . ) You 're mad at me . JACK Am I ? ABRAHAM God is mad at me because I waited so long to do those circumcisions . JACK Could be . ABRAHAM O.K. , O.K. I 'll get all the men together and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living out here in the desert , never taking a bath . I 'll give a feast . JACK Sure , Abraham . Have a feast if you want . ABRAHAM I want to know when we 're having something written down for this act . Are we doing Sodom and Gomorrah ? p. 65 JACK I do n't think so . ABRAHAM But those are big scenes for me . Walking around with God , looking for ten good men , saving my brother 's life ? JACK We 're not doing Sodom and Gomorrah because it does n't have Sarah in it . Sodom and Gomorrah is just you and Lot and a bunch of whores and drunks . ABRAHAM So ? JACK You can do Sodom when you do the movie . ABRAHAM I do n't get it . JACK ( Turning to Sarah . ) What shall we name the boy ? Isaac ? SARAH It 's a beautiful name . ABRAHAM What about your work ? SARAH What about it ? ABRAHAM You 'd never let anything interfere with your work . SARAH ( Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A voice told me to have a child . HAGAR She 's jealous . ABRAHAM Of what ? HAGAR Of the whole thing . Of you and me . She did this to get even . SARAH She did this p. 66 VIRGINIA God did this , Abraham . ABRAHAM God got my hundred year old wife pregnant ? JACK I love this . I absolutely love it . ( Pause . ) Virginia , this is exactly how we start the second act . p. 67 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE IX Sarah appears to be alone onstage . She wears a loose linen dress , padded to appear in the late weeks of pregnancy . She mutters to herself , as she works on her attitude for the scene . As she works , she experiments with the feel of the costume , seeing what it will do . SARAH Laughter . Sarah laughs . ( Pause . ) The Lord has brought me laughter . Let all who will laugh , laugh with me.  --  Ha Ha . ( Tom emerges from the shadows to dress her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used earlier . He adds pillows , spreads , and bedclothes for a new baby . ) TOM You look wonderful . You look so happy . SARAH I am happy . Finally , I 'm doing something that has to do with me . TOM I 'm putting your slippers right down here . SARAH I went over to Mom 's last night and asked her how ( Patting her stomach . ) Isaac would know I was his mother . She said he 'd recognize my voice . TOM How long do you think you 'll keep working ? SARAH I 'm not working after he 's born , I can tell you that . ( Jack enters ) p. 68 JACK Kitty , darling . You look fabulous . You feel so human here . SARAH I like this lady . Whenever she has a choice to make , she does the right thing . JACK I 'll say . Your childbed , Madam . Here , let me ( As Tom exits , Jack helps Sarah up into her bed . ) JACK I adore you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me five years ago that I 'd be having a baby JACK No , I know . When you first told me about it , I SARAH You freaked out . JACK I just had n't ever thought about it , you know . But now that I see how happy it makes you SARAH It 's a miracle . I know . JACK I only wish everyone were doing as well . I 'm afraid we 're going to have to replace Cliff . SARAH Replace him ? It 's only a week til previews . JACK Not for here . For New York . SARAH For New York ? JACK Yes , New York . Those people who saw the run-through yesterday are from the summer series at the Joyce . And they loved it , of course , and they want it for the first show of their season . They 're sending me a contract today . We 're going to New York , my love . p. 69 SARAH Jack . Have you talked to Cliff about this ? ( She leans back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was right when I cast him , but he 's really resisting me now . SARAH No , I know . JACK So all you have to do is tell me who you want your Abraham to be . Somebody like Bill Hurt would be great . Would n't hurt to have a star . SARAH Bill Hurt would be wonderful . JACK We can go a long , long way with this show , Kitty . No more of this regional life for us , sweetheart . We 're going to the big time . You and me . ( He takes her face in his hands . ) God , I love you . ( Then leaves . ) Got ta go . ( Sarah lies back on her bed and arranges her covers , as Tom comes on again , and Virginia enters , dressed as a handmaiden , or in this case a midwife . ) VIRGINIA My Lord , your midwife is ready . SARAH Virginia ! Are you really going to play this ? VIRGINIA I am . I 'm taking a leave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see this through . SARAH ( Reaching out for her hand . ) Good , I 'm glad . I 'm going to need you . p. 70 VIRGINIA Do you think Hagar should come to Isaac 's birth or not ? Historically , she would be there , as a member of your household , but we do n't have to have her if you do n't SARAH No . ( Appearing more uncomfortable . ) No Hagar . VIRGINIA Just the nurses then . We 'll keep Hagar outside with the rest of the tribe . ( Abraham stalks up to the edge of the stage . ) ABRAHAM Jack , I think I should be in this scene . ( Jack responds from his side of the stage . ) JACK I 'm not surprised . ABRAHAM She 's my wife . JACK Well , then . Send a card , why do n't you . Or some flowers . ABRAHAM Watch it . JACK I 'm hoping to , Abraham , if we can ever get to work here . ABRAHAM So talk to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , with some bad news . He likes Sarah 's boy much better than Hagar 's boy . Much more his type . You know , obedient . All that . So he 's cutting you Egyptian brat out of his will , and giving everything to Isaac . O.K. ? p. 71 ABRAHAM I want to be there . JACK At the birth ? No . ( Comes round the stage and calls to the stage manager . ) Tomashevsky . It 's showtime . The birth of Isaac . Go Sarah . SARAH ( Breathing heavily , in labor . ) " Call for Lord Abraham . My time is near . " ABRAHAM I 'm right here . VIRGINIA ( In character . ) " He can not be found , my Lord . " SARAH ( More insistent . ) " Find Lord Abraham . " JACK Louder , Sarah . SARAH " Find Lord Abraham . " ABRAHAM If she 's really giving birth , I could hear her all over the camp . I 'd be there in a second . SARAH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " VIRGINIA " Yes , my Lord . " ABRAHAM Why ca n't I go to her ? JACK You 're working . ( Sarah sits up on the bed , as Virginia comforts her . ) SARAH " Where is he ? " p. 72 VIRGINIA " I do n't know , my Lord . " SARAH " If I die " VIRGINIA " You will not die , my Lord . " ( Sarah grabs Virginia to hold onto her , but there is no attempt to imitate a birth here . Rather than pain , Sarah conveys something like surprise , or shock that this is actually happening . ) SARAH " The child is coming ! Help me . Help me . Abraham ! " JACK Andblackout ! ( Jack signals for the blackout , but there is none . ) JACK ( With a real gleam in his voice . ) Andwho 's got the baby ? TOM ( Pitching it onstage to Virginia . ) Right here . JACK O.K. Abraham . Go see the pretty baby . ( Sarah composes herself in the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is furious with Jack , and determined , somehow , to take control here . ) VIRGINIA And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac .  --  SARAH ( Brightly happily . ) " How do you like this child , husband ? " p. 73 ABRAHAM " I know not what to say to a child . Perhaps when he is " ( Abraham actually sees the baby now , and the effect on him is immediate . He extends his arms and Sarah gives him the child to hold . He clasps the child to him , overcome with emotion . ) ABRAHAM " He is a beautiful boy . " ( Abraham takes a moment , then speaks , his voice filled with love . ) " My Lord has said to me that this boy Isaac that , my son , Isaac , will be a king of my people , that my Lord 's everlasting covenant shall be with him , not with me . That all that all that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's purpose shall be accomplished not in my life , but in his . " ( Now , reverent and very happy , he puts the baby back in Sarah 's arms and kisses her . ) SARAH " When he is weaned , we will give a feast , to prove to all who would doubt that such a thing could happen , that this child of our old age lives and loves us . " JACK O.K. Virginia . Take the baby away now . It 's time for his nap . ( Virginia carries the swaddled bundle offstage , as directed . ) JACK Isaac ? ( Isaac enters , wearing jeans and a T-shirt . ) WILLIAM Right here . p. 74 JACK Well , come on in here Isaac . What are you , three now ? ( Jack pushes the boy down and he duckwalks over to Sarah . ) SARAH You do n't have to do that , honeybun . Just stand there and love your sweet Mom . JACK Ready ? ( Sarah strokes Isaac 's hair . ) SARAH " Hagar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Mistress . " SARAH " I 'm giving a feast for my son . " HAGAR " Yes , Mistress . " SARAH " I would enjoy it if you would come and dance for us . " HAGAR " I would be happy to , Mistress . " SARAH ( Proceeding . ) " But Hagar . Your son , Ishmael , though he is not required to attend this feast , must not interfere with it in any way . For this is my son 's first feast and I would not have him confused by foreign beliefs . " HAGAR Yes , Mistress . JACK Kitty , do you have that welcome speech ? SARAH Brothers of Nanna ? TOM Do you want this with the music , Jack ? p. 75 JACK If you 've got it . Let 's just run through this little feast and see what happens . ( There is a blast of a ram 's horn and Sarah steps up on a platform , in full ceremonial attitude . ) SARAH ( Joyous and ceremonial . ) " Brothers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us a child , born these three years ago , whose name is Isaac , whose weaning feast I now proclaim for two weeks hence , when all shall cease their travail and shall eat and drink from the fullness of the land , and shall make offerings to the Gods on high for holy be their name . Amen . " ( Abraham steps up onto the playing area , as if into the center of the feast . ) ABRAHAM " Good wife . I do n't see the boy , Ishmael . " SARAH " I have forbidden him to attend , husband . He is preaching the religion of Egypt and committing idolatry in the camp . " ABRAHAM " I was not aware of this . I will speak with the boy . " SARAH " I have spoken with him , husband . He will not listen . Hagar herself can not control him . " ABRAHAM " She has neither the skill , nor an interest in controlling other people . " ( Sarah walks away from him and up to the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music begins , and Hagar steps out of her dress , and is wearing only a slip , but it must look like something a maid might have danced in thousands of years ago . This is eroticism at its easiest and best . She picks up a tambourine and begins to dance . They are all amazed . It is directly pagan , in that everybody understands it immediately . At some point in the dance . Sarah can not watch any longer . She turns away , as Hagar makes it perfectly clear what Abraham sees in her . When the dance is over , Abraham lifts Hagar to her feet. ) p. 76 SARAH " Husband . " ABRAHAM " I will speak with the boy , Ishmael . And if he does not obey my orders , then I will send him away with the herdsmen where he SARAH " where he will corrupt their minds and harden their hearts as well . No , husband . The boy must go . " ABRAHAM " But his mother could never remain in the camp without him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must go . " ABRAHAM " But Ishmael is my son , too . " SARAH " Hagar . " HAGAR " Yes , Mistress . " SARAH " I can no longer abide the presence of your son in my camp . For your faithful service to me and my house , I grant you your freedom and that of the boy . " HAGAR " Thank you , mistress . " ABRAHAM " I will send five of my men with her to " SARAH " No . They must go alone . " ABRAHAM " Sarah . If you send them alone into the desert , they will die . " SARAH ( Ignoring him . ) " You will take your clothes , and the presents others have given you , and leave the camp at once . " p. 77 HAGAR " Yes , Mistress . " ABRAHAM ( Stepping out of character . ) So she 's sending me away too . Is that it ? JACK She is making you choose , but that 's fair . SARAH " Stay with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know that . JACK Big mistake . ( Abraham looks over at Jack . ) ABRAHAM Passion , right ? ( And Abraham walks over to Hagar , takes her face in his hands , and kisses her , with the most convincing display of passion we have ever seen , puts his arm around her and walks her offstage . The music ends and Sarah picks up the skirt of her dress so it will be easier for her to move . ) SARAH And my husband leaves with his whore and for all I know , I never see him again . VIRGINIA Yes . SARAH But I have Isaac , is that it ? JACK That 's the idea . Make you a big star . Mother of the Father of the Jews . SARAH But is the audience going to understand why I did this ? JACK Sure they will . Religious purity . All that . ( Sarah , Jack , and Virginia leave the stage and then downstage , in a dark corner , our attention is drawn to Abraham and Hagar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Her dance music returns , slower , and sadder . The shadows of trees are projected behind them , so that it seems like an outdoor night scene. ) p. 78 ABRAHAM " I can not bear to lose you . " HAGAR " Please let me go . She will kill me if she finds we are still here . " ABRAHAM " Take this loaf of bread and this jug of water and go to Beersheba . The wells there are mine , and I join you as soon as I can . " ( He gathers her up in his arms again . ) " And take this ring , ( And he hands her a ring. ) that anyone who questions you will know you are my wife . Do n't ride the camel , but walk beside him . In the shade . ( A moment . ) And remember there are wild dogs in the night ( He ca n't go on . ) Hagar . Hagar . " ( The music swells as she breaks away from him and wanders toward an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abraham goes offstage , as a brilliant light comes up on Hagar , and some kind of rattle starts to shake . ) VIRGINIA ( Reading offstage. )  --  But when Hagar arrived in Beersheba , she found no well from which to drink , for the servants of Abimelech had taken it violently away .  --  ( Hagar slumps down against a rock , and cradles the doll in her arms . ) VIRGINIA ( Continuing. )  --  And as the water was spent in her bottle , Hagar laid down her child , Ishmael , under one of the shrubs , and said .  --  p. 79 HAGAR Lord , let me not see the death of my child . VIRGINIA ( Continuing to read . ) And Hagar lifted up her voice and wept .  --  HAGAR ( Calling out . ) " Abraham ! " ( Abraham strides across the stage , looking even more wealthy than before , and sees Hagar . ) VIRGINIA " And the angel of the God called to Hagar and said " ABRAHAM " Fear not , Hagar , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well . Come drink . " ( Abraham crosses over to Hagar , lifts her up , then gives her water from his pouch . ) VIRGINIA  --  And the lad grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer . And Hagar took him a wife out of the land of Egypt . And Abraham sojourned there , in the land of the Philistines , for many years .  --  ( There is a moment of silence , and then Abraham takes a step toward Jack , still holding Hagar 's hand . ) ABRAHAM Doing what ? What am I doing with the Philistines for many years . JACK Getting rich . Is n't that what you wanted ? ABRAHAM Yes , I did , but p. 80 JACK You made your choice . What are you so upset about ? ABRAHAM I did n't have any choice and you know it . Hagar would 've died out there . JACK You do n't get it , do you ? ABRAHAM ( To Hagar . ) Excuse me , darling . ( He drops to his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACK ( Laughing . ) Very funny . ( But Abraham is serious . ) ABRAHAM Lord who spoke to me in the wilderness , heat me now . ( Jack walks over to Sarah , who has been watching with interest . ) JACK Are you hungry ? SARAH I 'm always hungry . JACK Then let 's go get something to eat . ( Abraham jumps up . ) ABRAHAM You took my wife , you threw me out of the camp , and now you try to kill the only family I 've got left . What the fuck do you want from me ? JACK Do n't forget everybody . We move into the theatre tomorrow . ( Jack leaves and Abraham is left sitting downstage with Hagar . Virginia walks through. ) p. 81 ABRAHAM I need some help , Virginia . VIRGINIA O.K. ( Hagar kisses Abraham lightly and leaves . ) ABRAHAM Does the Bible say what Abraham did when he was confused ? VIRGINIA No , it does n't . JACK I mean , once I see what this God 's up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thinkwhat Abraham does right now , is solve the problems he , Abraham , can solve , and not try too hard to understand what God is doing . He makes his own decisions , I mean . He protects the ones he loves and keeps working to provide for his people . ( A moment . ) Abraham has the courage to let Godbe weird or cruel or do whatever He feels like doing for a while , and simply trusts that God will wake up , which God has been known to do , and reward his faith and his patience . ( Abraham thinks a moment . ) VIRGINIA Can you do that ? ABRAHAM I think so . That helps a lot . ( He kisses her . ) Thanks . VIRGINIA You 're welcome . ( Lights dim to indicate the change of scene. ) p. 82 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE X Sarah is in full costume . Jack holds a clipboard . JACK I talked to the casting agent this morning . Bill Hurt is doing a movie . Dustin Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he 'll read it SARAH I think you should take Cliff .

I 'm sure you can find JACK But the baby is n't coming til November . SARAH I know , but I want to get ready . Buy a crib , hang some wallpaper , you know . Make a nest . JACK Fuck the nest . This show could transfer and run for a solid year . SARAH I do n't want to wake up in New York Hospital the morning after the baby 's born and wonder who I can get to take care of him so I can work . I do n't want to work . I want to take care of the baby . JACK Kitty , you are a world-class actress . I ca n't let you sacrifice your one shot at the big time . SARAH Who says this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I ca n't go to New York later if I need to . If this is my one shot at anything it 's being a mother , and I 'm going to take it . p. 83 JACK There 's lots of mothers . Millions of mothers . SARAH And I bet they all feel just like I do . JACK Which is why nobody wants to hire them . SARAH I ca n't believe you said that . JACK I want you with me . SARAH I ca n't . JACK But you 've got so much to do in the world , so much to give . SARAH Well , maybe I want to keep some of it . JACK ( Turning away . ) Great . SARAH They 're going to love you . You 'll be the talk of the town , you and Cliff . JACK You bet your ass we will .

I 'm fucked by a hormone . SARAH It 's a baby ! JACK Do n't you want to be a star ? SARAH Cliff wants to be the star . He 'll do whatever you say . JACK You 're damn right he will , and I 'll make him the biggest star anybody ever saw , and you 'll have your baby . SARAH Yes . JACK And the baby will grow up and leave you . And resent all the sacrifices you made for him . SARAH I know that . JACK So what is the point ? SARAH The point is that everybody leaves me anyway , Jack . So I want to be with the baby while I can . JACK You 'll be sorry about this . This really pisses me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( Abraham enters . ) ABRAHAM Oh hi there . I was just looking for you JACK Do you want this fucking part or not ? ABRAHAM Yes , I do . JACK Then I do n't want any more bullshit . Either you play this thing today or I 'm going to find somebody who can . You got that ? p. 85 ABRAHAM O.K. ( Watches Jack leave then turns-to Sarah . ) I need to come by the house sometime and pick up some things . SARAH Not the cat . ABRAHAM Ten years together and all you want is the cat ? JACK Abraham ! SARAH Do you want the cat ? ABRAHAM I never did like that cat . SARAH O.K. then . ( Abraham turns and leaves. ) p. 86 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE XI Hagar and Abraham stand with their backs to us , facing the sunset , his arms around her waist . Flute music plays in the background . This is a technical rehearsal on the actual stage , so we have full lights , costumes , and props @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we brighten up the sunset a little ? VOICE FROM THE BOOTH Like that ? JACK Thanks . O.K. Whenever you 're ready . VIRGINIA 'S VOICE ON TAPE " And the lad grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer . And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt . And Abraham sojourned there , in the land of the Philistines for many years . " ABRAHAM " May the pleasure of these days never end . " ( Hagar strokes Abraham 's face . ) ABRAHAM " May you live many years after I am dead , blessed by the joy you have given me . " VIRGINIA  --  But it came to pass that after these things , God appeared unto Abraham and said  --  ( Jack steps onstage , dressed in a dark business suit , looking very much like a banker . There is something new in his manner . Something dark and insistent. ) p. 87 JACK " Behold , Abraham . Here I am . " ( Abraham turns around , kneels , and bows his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord . I am your humble servant . What would you have of me ? " JACK ( Daring him . ) Take now thy son , Isaac , and get thee into the land of Moriah , and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will show to thee .  --  ( Abraham looks stunned . As Jack walks to the edge of the stage and puts on a headset , Hagar turns to Abraham . ) HAGAR " What troubles you , husband ? " ABRAHAM " My Lord has commanded me to go to Mount Moriah and sacrifice Sarah 's son Isaac . " HAGAR " He means for you to kill the boy ? " JACK ( Quietly over his headset . ) I ca n't see Hagar 's face , Bill . ( The light on her face changes . ) JACK That 's better . Go back , Hagar . HAGAR " He means for you to kill the boy ? " ABRAHAM " I know not what he means by this , but only what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely you can not " ABRAHAM " My God has commanded me thus . I can not refuse . " HAGAR " And if he asked you to kill our son , would you refuse him ? " ( Abraham looks offstage . ) ABRAHAM Jack ? JACK I warned you Abraham . ABRAHAM ( To Hagar ) Would you go back please , darling ? HAGAR " And if your God asked you to sacrifice ou son , would you do it ? " ( Abraham answers quickly now . ) ABRAHAM " Yes . " HAGAR ( Bitterly . ) " This is a jealous God . " ABRAHAM " I must go . This time I must obey Him with haste . But when I return in three days , I will tell thee all I know of this God who has blessed me so richly . " ( Hagar turns and walks downstage . Abraham looks after her , takes a step as if to follow her , then stops . ) ABRAHAM " Yes , Lord . I am ready . " JACK That 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) And on three to black , ( Lights dim to near black. ) p. 89 JACK Then on six for the desert at dawn . ( And the lights gradually pull back up into dawn as Virginia enters dressed as a scribe . ) VIRGINIA And Abraham rose up early in the morning to prepare for his journey , taking two of his young men with him .  --  ( Abraham walks to meet Sarah , who appears from the other side of the stage , Abraham is very much the noble lord . ) SARAH " Abraham " ABRAHAM " Good evening , Sarah . I trust you are well . " JACK More blue , Bill . Go on Sarah . SARAH " I am , thank you , husband . And I can see that your God has blessed you exceedingly . " ABRAHAM " He has granted me wisdom in matters of trade and counseled me so that I may conduct myself in a seemly manner among foreigners . " SARAH " I have seen you often in my dreams . " ABRAHAM " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " SARAH " I am glad . He too , has missed you . " ABRAHAM " I am journeying to Moriah , and thought to take him with me . It will benefit him greatly to see how a man can survive in such a harsh land . " p. 90 SARAH " But what is the purpose of your journey , my husband ? " ( Abraham takes a moment . ) ABRAHAM " A small village there produces saddlebags and bridles of exceptional quality . They have agreed that I shall sell their wares at the market in Byblos . " ( Then altering his tone . ) " Perhaps you would agree to accept a new saddle as a gift from me . " HAGAR Is Sarah really going to fall for that ? JACK Quiet ! ( But something about that warning has affected Sarah . ) SARAH " And go you also to give thanks to your God for the riches he has bestowed upon you ? " ABRAHAM " As in all things , I will heed his word . If he bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " HAGAR Do n't listen to him , Sarah . JACK We 're not improvising any more , darling .

( Sarah looks over at Hagar. ) p. 91 SARAH " Take the boy , then , for I would have him see his father in the exercise of his trade . But see that he worships not at this altar , for your faith is not his . " ABRAHAM " This I will do . " ( Sarah holds out her arm to Isaac , who enters now , carrying a sheepskin pouch over his shoulder . ) SARAH " Isaac , my sweet child .

Abraham . p. 92 SARAH What 's that for ? JACK You really hate that little rat , do n't you . ABRAHAM Whatever you say . JACK ( To the light booth . ) We have to hold for a minute , Bill . I want to change some of this blocking SARAH To what ? JACK Something else . ( As Jack rearranges Abraham and Isaac , Sarah walks over to stand with Virginia . ) SARAH Do you know what this is about ? VIRGINIA No . JACK O.K. Virginia . Where were we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off , and said to his young men  --  ( Jack watches as Isaac stands beside Abraham . ) ABRAHAM  --  Abide ye here below while the lad and I go yonder and worship .  --  JACK Give Isaac the knife . ( Abraham picks up the wood and gives Isaac the knife . ) VIRGINIA  --  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and the fire in his hand , and a knife and they went both of them together .  --  p. 93 ABRAHAM Can I have a real knife ? SARAH Not if Isaac is carrying it . JACK Tomorrow , Abraham . ( Taking off his headset . ) Now just stand there . I want to move this altar a little ( Calling to the stage manager . ) Tom ?

WILLIAM ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes my son . " WILLIAM " I see the fire and the wood , but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ? " ABRAHAM " God will provide a lamb , my son .

WILLIAM ( Really scared . ) " But father " SARAH The scene was good . JACK It was n't scary . ( Moving around toward the altar . ) Pull his hood back . I want to see that neck . SARAH No !

SARAH No ! JACK Now kill him ! ( Sarah sees the vengeance in their eyes and runs offstage screaming . And as Abraham plunges the cardboard knife down , as if to kill the boy , Virginia screams , runs up and catches Abraham 's arm . ) VIRGINIA Abraham ! Stop ! Jack ! You ca n't kill the boy ! That 's not what happens . JACK We did n't kill him ! ABRAHAM I could though . JACK Thanks . That 's all I wanted to know . Great work . HAGAR This is sick . ( Leaves the stage . ) VIRGINIA ( To the boy . ) Are you all right ? WILLIAM Yeah . ( Gets down from the altar and takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way too far here . JACK I have not .

JACK ( Most condescending . ) Try the bathroom . VIRGINIA ( Running offstage . ) Kitty ! JACK ( Disgusted . ) O.K. Play the tape , Tom . VIRGINIA  --  Then Abraham beheld behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : And Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .  --  ( Abraham looks out toward Jack . ) ABRAHAM Better ? VIRGINIA And the Lord said unto Abraham  --  ( Abraham , turns slowly , kneels , facing upstage and listens to the voice of the Lord . ) JACK 'S VOICE ON TAPE  --  because thou has done this thing , and hast not with-held thy son , thine only son , I will bless thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heaven , and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .  --  ( Abraham stands , as Jack rushes onstage to hug him. ) p. 97 JACK All right . Finally . ( Abraham sits down on the altar . The feeling of camaraderie with Jack is so strong , he is reluctant to speak , but the weight of what has just happened is too much for him . ) ABRAHAM But when I get back to Beersheba , Hagar has left me .

( Abraham laughs , as though this is a silly request . And then complies . ) ABRAHAM Here it comes . HAGAR I 'm ready . ( They kiss and Tom snaps a few more shots , as they improvise a few more poses . And then Hagar leaves . ) HAGAR O.K. See you later . ( Abraham continues to stand , as Tom takes-his pictures . And it seems to us , that with each picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more grand . ) ABRAHAM What do you think they 'll ask me ? The reporter , I mean . TOM Oh , you know , how you prepare for a role , what it 's like , working with a company this way . ( A moment . ) What you 're doing next . ( A moment . ) What do the Tri-Star guys want ?

I 'll get you the contacts so you can pick the ones you want them to use . ( Tom exits . ) ( Sarah walks through to pick up something she has left on the stage . She makes no attempt to contact him visually. ) p. 100 ABRAHAM You 're really not going with us to New York ? SARAH No . I 'm not . ABRAHAM Why not ? SARAH Because Jack is a tyrannical bastard and you are his blind slave , andI do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show we ever did . SARAH I know that . ABRAHAM You have to come with us , Kitty . It 's what we worked our whole lives for in this rat hole , to take some show to New York ! SARAH I worked my whole life in this rat hole because I loved it , because I loved you , because we were making something out of all that work , but no . You had to go and ABRAHAM Me ? You 're the one having the baby . SARAH Oh , are you the victim now ? You the wounded one ? You the one with the broken heart ? ABRAHAM You 're leaving me for some baby you do n't even know ! SARAH Yes I am . As fast as I can . ABRAHAM You 'll be sorry . SARAH Why does everybody keep saying that to me ? Is that supposed to scare me , " I 'm going to be sorry ? " Because if it is you can save your breath . I 'm going to be sorry either way , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well be that you thought you were free to hurt me . You thought I would always be there .

Do n't hurt me . ( A moment . ) ABRAHAM I do n't know how this happened . SARAH What did you think would happen ? ABRAHAM I thought we would get through it . SARAH Like all the other times ? ABRAHAM Yes , like all the other times . What 's so special about this time ? SARAH Nothing , really . Except , I guess that if you really do n't want something to break , you have to force yourself to stop dropping it . ABRAHAM But I miss you so much . I miss talking to you . I miss going home with you . I miss talking about the show . SARAH I liked that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to say ? Whatever you want me to say I 'll say it . ( He puts his hands on her shoulders , now , trying to get through to her . ) SARAH ( She throws his hands off . ) You 're going to be a big star . p. 102 ABRAHAM Yes , I am . SARAH Say thank you . ( And she turns angrily and storms offstage . ) ( Lights dim to indicate change of scene. ) p. 103 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE XII Onstage , lights come up on The Tomb . This is the real performance . A throne is in place far upstage . A strange blue light shines on the altar , which has become Sarah 's bier . VIRGINIA 'S VOICE ON TAPE  --  And Sarah died in Hebron , in the land of Canaan . And Abraham laid aside his labors in Beersheba , and came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her .  --  ( Abraham walks onstage , looks at the tomb , then turns upstage . ) SARAH " Abraham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirls around . ) ABRAHAM " Sarah . I did not think to hear your voice again . " SARAH " My spirit is permitted this moment . " ABRAHAM " I have chosen a tomb for you . It is the cave of Machpelah , which the children of Heth have sold me for a burying place . " SARAH " It is good . I would remain in this land . And when you die , husband , where shall you rest ? " ABRAHAM " I do not know . " SARAH " I would welcome your company at Machpelah if there is room enough . " ABRAHAM " You would have me with you ? " p. 104 SARAH " Should I wake , my husband , it would comfort me greatly to have your company on my journey . " ( He goes to her and takes her hand . ) ABRAHAM " I have not loved you as you deserved . " SARAH " Nor was I made to love a husband , but rather my people and my God . " ABRAHAM " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to speak . ) ABRAHAM " Your son Isaac is well . When it is time for him to marry , I will send one of my servants to that land from whence we came , to take him a wife from our family there . " SARAH " That would please me . " ABRAHAM " It is my God who has commanded me thus . " SARAH " Then farewell . And grace be unto you , husband , and to your son Isaac . I can speak no more . " ( She sinks into his arms , and he lays her gently back on the stone slab . ) ABRAHAM Sarah . VIRGINIA  --  And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old ; and these were the years of the life of Sarah .  --  ( Abraham stands and looks away a moment. ) p. 105 VIRGINIA  --  Then again Abraham took a wife , and her name was Keturah . And she bare him Zimran , and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.  --  ( Abraham takes off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) VIRGINIA  --  But Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac .  --  ( Abraham leads Isaac onstage , who kneels and kisses Sarah . ) VIRGINIA  --  And when Abraham died , his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah with his wife , Sarah .  --  ( Abraham makes his way back to the throne and sits down on it and closes his eyes . Isaac then drapes a robe over him . ) VIRGINIA  --  And these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived , an hundred and three score and fifteen years .  --  ( Virginia enters , wearing white robes , kneels briefly before Abraham , then kisses Sarah 's forehead and strokes her hair , then takes Isaac 's hand and moves to center stage . ) VIRGINIA  --  And it came to pass after the burial of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and said , " Go not down into Egypt ; but dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of ; ; and I will bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father . I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven , and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because Abraham heard my voice and obeyed .  --  ( Virginia kneels with Isaac and we hear the sound of the audience clapping . And the lights dim to indicate a change of scene. ) p. 106 p. 107 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE XIII Lights come up as we hear the sound of applause and Sarah sits up from her bier . Neither of them has any idea what to say after playing that scene . They begin taking off parts of their costumes . Tom enters immediately . TOM Good show , everybody . Half-hour tomorrow night is seven-thirty . SARAH Thanks . ( Now Isaac comes in in street clothes and kisses Sarah . ) SARAH Willie , sweetheart . You were great . You want to go get a hamburger ? WILLIAM I ca n't . My parents are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac kisses her , then waves to Abraham . ) WILLIAM Goodnight , Cliff . ABRAHAM Take it easy .

ABRAHAM How about if I just bring the Tri-Star guys over ? p. 108 HAGAR I like Tri-Star . ( Hagar exits and Virginia enters from another dressing room . ) VIRGINIA Good night , everybody . ABRAHAM You ought to be real proud of yourself , Virginia . How does it feel ? VIRGINIA I 'm scared about the critics . ABRAHAM ( He hugs her . ) Do n't worry . They 'll love your work , I know they will . You think you 'll do this again ? VIRGINIA Maybe . ABRAHAM ( He kisses her . ) You have to . There 's not a lot of good writers around . O.K. Got ta get dressed . ( Abraham ducks behind a screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , Virginia ? Are the conservatives at the seminaries going to freak out over this ? VIRGINIA I do n't think so . I mean , it is what happened . If anybody says anything to you , get their name and I 'll send them some books . ( Virginia kisses her . ) SARAH Are you hungry ? VIRGINIA I could use a burger . See you at Timmy 's ? ( Sarah gives her a hug now . A real moment of solidarity . Jack enters , and Virginia exits without saying anything to him. ) p. 109 JACK Cliff , what kind of housing do you want in New York ? Hotel or apartment . ABRAHAM ( From behind the screen . ) Hotel . Near the park if they can swing it . So I can run . JACK Will do . And we made an offer to thatactress we talked about the other day . And it looks like it 's a done deal . ( Cliff , looking very elegant in his jeans and gold-rimmed glasses , comes out from behind the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great . ( Jack 's cellular phone rings . ) JACK Yeah . ( He listens . ) O.K. guys . It 's my spy at the Journal . ( He listens . ) Fabulous . Read it to me . ( He listens , then quotes . ) " Cliff Well 's transformation from tribal househusband to noble patriarch is nothing short of miraculous . Before our very eyes , the pagan age of mystery and moon worship ends , and the sun rises on the world as we know it . " ( To the caller . ) Thanks , Marge . ( He turns off his phone . ) We did it . You did it , Cliff . You got them . I knew you could . ABRAHAM ( Coming out from behind the screen . ) It was you , Jack . All you . Did they say anything about you ? p. 110 JACK About the director ?

You 're just SARAH Staying home . ABRAHAM O.K. Well . I 've got to go . ( He leans over to kiss the top of her head . He is as tender as he knows how , trying to say everything he does n't know how to say . ) Thanks . ( He leaves . ) ( A single light holds on Sarah , as she watches him go . She turns , her face composed , a slight smile. )
