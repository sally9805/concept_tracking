On his first day on the witness stand , General William C. Westmoreland described how he made frequent visits to his field commanders in Viet Nam to hear their briefings and get firsthand impressions . He used the word briefings as an old soldier would , perhaps not even aware of its connection to his $120 million libel suit against CBS . For briefings are also what journalism is about-gathering facts , asking questions and then briefing a public that has n't the time or the patience to hear it all . <P> Did CBS choose unfairly to prove a thesis when it reduced hours of taped interviews to make a 90-min . Viet Nam documentary in which General Westmoreland came off looking bad ? In a paneled and marbled federal courtroom in Manhattan , television screens are arrayed so that judge , jury , lawyers and spectators can see replays of what CBS chose and what it disregarded . This unusual behind-the-scenes look at the editing process disturbs the press-reporters think they should be judged by their printed stories , not by their notes ; television producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Back in 1964 the Supreme Court ruled , in a case that the press hailed as a great victory , that a public figure suing for libel must prove not only that a statement was false but that it was made knowing it to be false " or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not . " But how else can one tell whether the writer or editor knew something to be false without knowing what was in his mind , or knowing what he had to go on ? And thus the New York Times Co. vs . Sullivan decision of 1964 , which was never intended to do the press a favor-it was meant to ensure that public debate should be " uninhibited , robust and wide-open " - has since been giving the press a lot of trouble . Lawyers can now call up notes , unused film and memos to ask a witness why he chose one quote and not another , and to attack each choice as prejudiced . <P> Selection itself is no proof of bias , it is merely a necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to the thousands it prints ; hours of tape must be fitted to the time constraint of a half-hour news program . The bias , if there is one , is less apt to be in ideology than in choosing what will most interest the audience or document the thesis the journalist has found in the material .
