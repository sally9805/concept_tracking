Mrs. Tainsh grew up in Australia and graduated from Melbourne University with an art degree . She spent some years in public relations work and then took a diploma in secondary education , teaching until entering the full-time healing ministry of Christian Science in 1974 . Mrs. Tainsh is a teacher of Christian Science and lives in Adelaide , the capital of South Australia. // The lecturer was introduced by Roderick Nordell , a local member of The Mother Church. // An abridged text of the lecture follows : // Out in the Australian bush one day we watched two different birds building their nests . One , a pardalote , had made his little tunnel in a sandy cliff face . He had chosen a spot near a jutting root , where he could land with his bits of dry grass before diving into the hole. // The other was a tree creeper , who likes to line his nest with fur . He hunted around on the ground  --  not on a tree trunk , where he mostly works  --  until he found an old rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought : " Whats telling you both what to do ? Where to look , what to choose ? Is there a computer in those tiny heads ? Or are you obeying some other kind of direction , some power outside yourselves ? " // Instinct ? Perhaps , but it seemed to me that something greater than that was hinted at here . After all , if you or I had chosen such a clever spot to build a house  --  sheltered , high up from floods , with a natural patio at the front door  --  would we put it all down to instinct ? Not all ! Wouldn ' t we say we had used our intelligence ? // And I realized that was what I was feeling there  --  the presence of intelligence . I couldn ' t see it , or hear it , or touch it , but it was there just the same. // We get these feelings sometimes , don ' t we ? Have you ever been way out in the country at night , for instance . " Out bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way out under the night sky with not a city light in sight . You look up at the stars , and their wonder and beauty take hold of you . There ' s a great sense of order and design , the sense of power way beyond human knowledge . And  --  to me  --  there ' s a great sense of the presence of intelligence itself. // I remember feeling it very strongly one night when I was flying home across the Pacific Ocean . I ' d been asleep and when I woke up , I opened the little shutter on the window , and there was the Southern Cross , hanging serenely out there , every star in place , just as it was when I left it . <> <> What and where is intelligence ? // Is the intelligence that holds the stars in their place the same intelligence that guides the birds in their home building ? The same intelligence that guides you and me in our home building ? What is intelligence , and where is it ? That ' s what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s what everybody wants to know who ' s interested in what our thinking is , and where it comes from. // So , just where does it come from ? The notion that ideas come to us from somewhere outside ourselves is , of course , not all unusual and not at all new . For instance , I noticed in one of our local papers recently an article by a composer of music who teaches at the University of Adelaide ( Richard Meale , senior fellow in composition , quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser ) . He was describing how he went about composing a piece of music . He said he made plans and sketches , ready to receive the idea which he knew would come to him from " out there . " He said he knew he would recognize when it came , and that when it did , the composition was born . Where did it come from ? The composer said he felt it came from what he called " the world of infinite possibilities . " We could also call it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And once we begin to think in terms of the infinite  --  no beginning , no ending  --  can ' t we begin to think in terms of the divine ? // There was one man who understood that the source of his thinking was indeed divine  --  and that was Jesus Nazareth . " I can of mine own self do nothing , " he said . " As I hear , I judge : and my judgement is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me " ( John 5 : 30 ) . // " As I hear . . . . " The greatest Teacher was the greatest listener . He worked tirelessly to show mankind that God , the Father of us all , is right here , so close we can always hear Him if we listen . This guiding , directing presence of God is the Christ , and it ' s the Christ that fills human consciousness with all the inspiration it needs ( see " Science and Health with Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 332 ) . It was the Christ that filled the consciousness of Jesus and motivated him so consistently that he is known as " Christ Jesus . " <> <> Jesus listened to God ' s judgment // So when the unpleasant and evil pitiful sights and sounds of the world crowded in on Jesus ' consciuosness , what did they meet ? They met the divine thoughts already firmly held in his understanding . There was no room for anything else . Jesus didn ' t accept the unintelligent matter-judgment that said , " Here ' s a leper . Here ' s a sinner . " No ! He listened to the judgment of the Father : " Here is My image and likeness , as perfect as I created him , " and this correct judgment healed the leper and reclaimed the sinner. // Jesus listened so closely to the Father so he could teach us how to do the same  --  how to open our hearts and minds to the inspiration of good that ' s all around us . Closer than the air . Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t it ! When you come to think of it , the great inspirational leaders of mankind  --  all those who in some way have raised the nonmaterial level of human thinking  --  they ' ve all been great listeners  --  not to human opinion , but to a much higher source of inspiration. // Among them was a great religious leader , Mary Baker Eddy . Now there was a listener ! She had all the qualities of the true listener  --  humility , obedience , and vision . All her life , she loved the teachings of Christ Jesus , and , being obedient , she tried to put them into practice , all of them . And as her spiritual understanding grew , she gained the vision that enabled her to heal , just as Jesus taught , and then she was able to teach others . So we find in her both follower and Leader  --  follower of Christ Jesus and Leader of the Christian Science movement . <> <> A rule based on humility // Now there ' s an important thing to note just here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Follow your Leader only so far as she follows christ " ( " Message to The Mother Church for 1901 , " p. 34 ) . Now that ' s not the kind of rule that would come from some puffed-up personality , out to establish some new cult of worship . No . It was the rule of a deeply Christian woman , whose mission was to bring to this age the ageless healing Christ , in a truly Christian religion. // She was to found a church that strives to teach and practice exactly as Jesus did , including the healing of the sick through prayer alone . To found a church ! That wasn ' t easy . First of all , she was a woman . Second , human nature always resists change , and it especially hates to be stirred up to think more spiritually . So she faced enormous opposition , not only from entrenched theology and medicine but from among the ranks of her own small group of students. // But she never lost her habit of listening for God ' s direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought God ' s guidance through prayer and study of the Bible . And so , inevitably , her church took shape. // It ' s a church that teaches the simple , profound truth that God is good and God is All , so al is good . That evil , therefore , can have in reality no place , no power , no entity . That the world ' s **28;7023; belief <> in evil can be corrected , by divenely inspired thought . Perhaps that ' s what has brought you here , to find out something of what Christian Science teaches about thought. // Christian Science is based squarely on the Bible , especially the **28;7053; spiritual <> meaning of the Bible ( see " Retrospection and Introspection , " p. 25 ) . This spiritual meaning is what Mary Baker Eddy grasped as the result of her years of faithful study . She discovered the spiritual significance of events related in both the Old and New Testaments , and it was on this discovery that she founded her religion. // She found that God , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed the **28;7083; only <> presence , the infinite everpresent creator of man and the universe . And that , being infinite  --  no beginning , no ending  --  He must be Spirit . As infinite Spirit , He could have no knowledge of matter. // Then what about man ? Man , made in the likeness of his creator , Spirit , must be  --  spiritual ! The mortal , faulty model , known as " mankind , " is only a limited , mistaken concept , never the real , spiritual man , and this faulty concept can be corrected and improved as the real spiritual nature of man is better understood . And Mrs. Eddy saw that this was how Jesus healed ( see Science and Health , p. 476 ) . She proved his method to be just as valid today by quickly and permanently healing all kinds of illness through prayer alone . The prayer that lifts thought to understand the spiritual nature of God and man . <> <> Expanding concept of the source of wisdom // Have you ever considered that the great spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of God as Spirit ? The Christ  --  the enlightening presence of God  --  was at work in their consciousness , and as their concept of Deity widened and deepened , they began to see Him as the source of all real wisdom and knowledge . They saw that to be almighty , He must surely be all-knowing . We find this growing understanding recorded in many parts of the Old Testament . Here ' s a verse from Psalms : " Great is our Lord , and of great power : His understanding is infinite " ( Ps. 147 : 5 ) . And from Proverbs : " The Lord giveth wisdom : out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding " ( Prov. 2 : 6 ) . You see how the spiritual nature of intelligence is beginning to emerge ? // Sayings like these indicated to Mrs. Eddy something of the inifinite nature of true wisdom and understanding . As she pondered and listened , a mighty truth was revealed to her  --  that not only is God the source of all wisdom and understanding , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind . And as He ' s the infinite , the only God , He ' s the only Mind . Throughout Mrs. Eddy ' s writings we find God referred to over and over again in Mind , or divine Mind , which expresses itself in its idea , spiritual man. // In her book " Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures , " Mrs. Eddy explains Mind as : " not that which is **28;7143; in <> man , but the divine Principle , or God , of whom man is the full and perfect expression " ( p. 591 ) . And on another page she writes , " Mind is the I AM , or infinity . Mind never enters the finite . Intelligence never passes into non-intelligence , or matter " ( p. 336 ) . <> <> Is thought in the brain ? // If man is really idea , the expression of Mind , and if intelligence never passes into non-intelligence , where does brain come in ? // It ' s a pretty widely held notion , isn ' t it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How often do we hear things like " Isn ' t he brainy ! " Or , on the other side , " What a pinhead ! " So let ' s look at this question of brain. // Physical scientists who believe we think with our brain study it in great detal . Here they believe they ' ll find what makes us tick . Here they believe they ' ll find how thought is born . And , what ' s more alarming , here they believe they ' ll find how to control thought with material agents , perhaps chemical or electronic . They believe that in the fleshly composition of the brain lies the secret of what makes an Einstein and what makes a Charlie Brown . But can anything to having to do with **28;7173; thought <> really be found in a hunk of matter ? // The brain is a complicated hunk of matter that fills up the space in our heads . It sits up there on the top floor and acts as a kind of clearinghouse for all the information fed into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses . Information that is , therefore , **28;7203; all about matter <> . Now , if the brain ' s only source of information is **28;7233; material <> , how can it produce anything as nonmaterials as an idea ? // Ideas , as I ' m thinking of them , have little to do with what the senses tell us . But ideas ! Those original thoughts that come to us all ! They must surely spring forth independently of matter ! // The world ' s full of ideas , thousands and thousands of ideas , all there , waiting to be used . All where ? In the brain ? Mrs. Eddy rules that idea right out of court when she writes , " The belief that a pulpy subsntance under the skull is mind is a mockery of intelligence , a mimicry of Mind " ( Science and Health , p. 192 ) . // So , as we begin to see that matter can never produce mind , we can safely leave behind the concept that intelligence has anything to do with the brain. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve  --  whether it ' s finding a job , curing an illness , saving a marriage , passing an exam  --  we have the ability to think it through to a right conclusion . This is the Christ at work , and we ' re alert to the directives of the Christ to the degree that we put self-will and human planning right out of the picture , no matter how righteous they may seem  --  and turn humbly to the Father . " Father , what shall I do ? " he ' s our authority  --  not the brain ! <> <> Healing of a mental disturbance // Let me describe to you what this release from believing the brain was the authority meant to a young woman I know . She believed there was something wrong with her nerves , and that this was affecting her brain , and she was therefore going out of her mind . She became so confused and miserable that she had to leave her job . She was urged to seek medical help , but was reluctant to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often prescribed in such cases. // Then she remembered something of what she had learned when she ' d briefly attended a Christian Science Sunday School years before . It had taught her that healing can take place without drugs . Here was a ray of hope . She began to attend the Christian Science church in her town on Sundays and Wednesday evenings . On weekdays she would go to the church ' s public Reading Room and find much comfort in studying the Bible and Science and Health. // Feeling the need for further support , she asked a Christian Science practitioner to help her through prayer . The practitioner reassured her at once that her ability to think had nothing to do with her brain . That her intelligence was safely and forever anchored in the one infinite Mind , and that she could ' t go **28;7263; out <> of her Mind , because it was infinite . The young woman began to feel a sense of peace and safety and sanity. // As she and the practitioner worked together over a number of weeks , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never outside of His care . Until this time , she ' d been feeling very much alone , very much a worried and nervous little atom , battling for existence in a difficult world , bullied by her nerves and badgered by what she believed were laws of mental health. // But as the real law , the law of God , the law of good , was acknowledged , she felt it at work in her consciousness . She began to let go of any notion that she had a separate little mind , controlled by the nerves of her body . Instead , the wonderful truth took hold that she herself was a spiritual **28;7293; idea <> , helf forever in the one and only Mind , in God. // Gone was the desperate feeling of being separate and alone . Her thinking took on the confidence and order so natural to Mind ' s idea . Soon she was free , and able to go back to work in a job that demanded special mental alertness . Nothing medical had been done to the brain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working in the human consciousness , had corrected the material notion about the nature of intelligence and had replaced it with the truth of her being . The young woman put it this way when she wrote to the practitioner : " Thank you for helping me to find my identity . " <> <> Identity found in consciousness // Where did she find her identity ? Not in the body  --  that had proved very unreliable . No , she found her identity in her thinking , in consciousness . Her concept of herself had been corrected and improved. // And how did the practitioner help ? She began by filling her own thought with the spiritually scientific fact that God , divine Mind , is the only real consciousness , and that this consciousness is the atmosphere that envelops all true creation . It is God ' s infinite knowing . Nothing is outside , because there ' s no outside to infinity . This atmosphere is infinity . It ' s filled with the ideas of God ' s knowing  --  divine Mind expressing itself ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound of these ideas is man , spiritual man , the full expression of Mind . Each one of us , in our true , spiritual selfhood , fully represents the compound idea , man . Our individual identity lies in how each of us uniquely expresses the qualities of God ' s knowing  --  His strength , joy , intelligence , beauty , energy . This is the answer to the old question " Who am I ? " This is where the young woman found her identity  --  not as a parcel of flesh and bones , but as idea , the intelligent expression of the one Mind . <> <> Seeing the past the labels of ' IQ ' // Now let ' s turn to another area in our daily lives where this question of intelligence is always under the microscope  --  education . Our educators , from play-school to university , watch their students closely in the light of their expectations of intelligence . And because this faculty seems to vary so greatly , many subscribe to the theory that intelligence , wherever it may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a big dollop for baby " A " , and not so long for baby " B "  --  and that , as the child grows a little , this dollop can me measured and the child cataloged accordingly. ut was this how the greatest educator saw hs pupils ? jesus ' immediate disciples must have seemed to their contemporaries as average group of students as you might find anywhere : Peter , impetous and lovable , but who sometimes exasperated his Teacher ; methodical Matthew ; the plodding Thomas ; and the brothers James and John , whom Jesus called " the sons of thunder " ( Mark 3 : 17 ) . We all know those sons of thunder in the class , don ' t we ? How was Jesus able to teach such an average-looking group so that some of them at least were able to carry on his work with such spectacular success ? // First of all , didn ' t he see them all the sons of the one Father ? " Thine they were , " he said , " and thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so he accepted for them the ability and intelligence he accepted for himself . And he was able to lead them , step by step , through parable and proof , to grasp the greatest truth mankind can know . And after his final lessons with them  --  the crucifixion and resurrection and the ascension  --  they were to become graduates in this truth  --  that life and intelligence can never be destroyed because they ' re divine , they belong to God . And so these simple men were to go out into the world and perform work of the highest caliber . <> <> Limitations lifted // Now if there are any teachers or parents laboring under the notion that the children in their care are of limited intelligence , let them turn to the great Teacher and learn how to seem them as they really are . I learned this lesson in my own experience as a high school techer. // In the psychology of teaching it is well known that if you ' re given a group of students already labeled " bright " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them accordingly , with predictable results . When I first went out to teach high school , I fell right into this trap . Something called the " Intelligence Quotient Test " had just come on the market . This claimed to be able to measure a child ' s ability to think and reason and label him accordingly , more or less for the rest of his life . It all sounded very impressive . Everyone was talking " IQ . " Everyone seemed to accept it in those days . So when I was given a group of children who had been labeled " low IQ , " I expected they wouldn ' t be very inspiring to teach . So my teaching wasn ' t very inspiring , and we were all pretty miserable together. // But I longed to help them . Already they were seeing themselves as failures . It seemed so unfair that they should be facing life under such a handicap. // I knew some of Christian Science , and I prayed to be shown how to be a better teacher for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought : See them as they are. // I realized what I had been doing . I ' d been seeing and teaching them as if they were limited mortals , as children whose supply of intelligence was somehow restricted . But how could this be , when I knew the source of all intelligence to be unrestricted ? // And so I shifted my point of view . Instead of seeing them in the limiting framework of a man-made intelligence quotient , I began to look at them from the summit of their infinite Mind , **28;7323; our <> infinite Mind , which has no framework , no horizons . And I began to teach them from this point of view. // My prayers for the inspiration and patience to meet their needs were abundantly answered . The intelligence that had been theirs all the time began to seen . A sullen or vacant face came alive . " I can ' t " became " I ' ll try . " Someone who had been terrified of figures began to delight  --  and then to excel  --  in speed-and-accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t finish a sentence on paper began to write fluently. // At half-year , the group put on an exhibition of work that surprised the rest of the school . At the end of the year , those ready to leave went off confidently to jobs or apprenticeships . The rest went into the mainstream of the school. // What had happened ? This : When I had turned in prayer to our loving , caring Father who is infinite Mind , **28;7353; I <> had been set free from the temptation to believe a human opinion that a person ' s ability to think is limited and so can be measured . Instead , I ' d come to trust that God ' s Word is law . His law for those children , and for every one of us , was to be like Him , to express Him with unlimited , immeasurable intelligence **28;7383; outside <> of material circumstances . As my original attitude was corrected and healed , the children felt it , and began to emerge into a wider mental experience . It was like watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shriveled to let anything out ! // We live and move and have our being in the consciousness of the Father , and so our intelligence is right here . It ' s got nothing to do with who our grandparents were , what color we are , how healthy or wealthy we are . The Father doesn ' t know us in terms of genes and chromosomes , rich and poor . He ' s Spirit , and knows us as His spiritual idea , whom He dearly loves and cares for . To understand this is to be free of the slavery of human opinion . <> <> Eczema healed // Divine intelligence frees us also from the slavery of physical troubles . Is there anything intelligent about sickness ? Is it an intelligent thing for normal , healthy functions to break down ? It ' s hardly the will of the God whose " understanding is infinite " ! and so it ' s a glorious fact that His infinite intelligence fress us more and more from our physical ailments. // Let me show you . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe case of eczema from shortly after birth , and was placed under specialist medical care . After about 12 months , with no cure , the family heard of Christian Science . The parents withdrew the child from medical treatment and went to a christian Science practitioner . In three days the skin of the little one was clean and fresh , and it stayed that way . How did this happen ? Through prayer . The young mother studied the chapter on prayer in Science and Health , and the practitioner , in her prayer , affirmed that only what divine Mind knew about the child could be true . She assured the anxious parents that a wise and loving Father could never send such an affliction to one of His little ones . A line from one of Mrs. Eddy ' s poems helped the mother to see the real identity of the child : " Thou gentle beam of living Love " ( " Christian Science Hymnal , " No. 23 ) . Mistaken human opinion had again been corrected by divine intelligence . <> <> Helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Science to take care of their children do so because they know they can trust this logical loving , and wholly Christian truth to heal their little ones . Children brought up in Christian Science learn to love and trust God , and are beautifully free from many of the fears  --  and therefore many of the troubles  --  that are too often implanted in young minds . Children who know their loving Father is always right by their side often heal themselves and others by their simple trust. // We ' re all children in a sense . Children of the one all-knowing , all-loving Father . It doesn ' t matter whether on the human scene we ' re black or brown or yellow or pink  --  one of the millions of a teeming metropolis or one of a few in some remote outpost . Wherever and whatever we are , our Father is already there . His divine intelligence pervades the whole of human experience. // Let ' s go out of here now and look for the signs of His intelligence . They ' re all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more we see , the more we ' ll go on seeing , until we find there ' s really nothing else to know . All our knowing is His knowing , the divine and only Mind , your Mind , our Mind , which has no horizons .
