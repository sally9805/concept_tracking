But Soviet experts insisted , on the third day of a symposium on the Chernobyl disaster , that the proposed modifications would increase safety. // Since the loss of the No. 4 unit at the Chernobyl plant and the shutdown of the three other units there , the Soviet Union has continued to operate reactors of the same type at five major commercial nuclear power stations . <> <> West Calls Plans Inadequate // Western representatives at the symposium , which has been organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency , said the proposed Soviet improvements would increase safety but would not be enough to insure protection against another accident that could again spread wide radiation. // After two days of relative harmony , Western scientists expressed displeasure at the Soviet safety plans and also at Soviet answers to questions about the accident. // " The Soviets are not prepared to respond to detailed questions , " said Dr. Richard Wilson , a Harvard expert on severe nuclear accidents . <> <> Russians Also Seek Ideas // Today was supposed to be the first day for Western questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the explosion . Instead the Soviet scientists started asking questions about Western reactors , according to Western scientists who attended a closed technical meeting. // As a result , an American said , details are lacking in the effort to determine whether lessons for Western reactors could be drawn from the Soviet accident. // Armen Abagyan , the director of the Nuclear Power Station Institute in Moscow , said at a news conference , " We have been talking for two days . We have presented an enormous amount of material . " He said the Soviet delegates wanted to hear ideas from other delegations , and objected to criticism about the Soviet safety plans. // " The improvements we have introduced make these reactors safe and guarantee against a recurrence of such an accident , " he said. // The explosion occurred after Soviet operators shut off safety equipment , in violation of procedures , to do a test , the Soviet report says . The Russians have conceded that the graphite reactors of the type used in the Chernobyl plant also had design problems. // Among them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reactors , the Soviet graphite units have a tendency to increase dramatically in power and run away if they lose cooling water . The problem has to do with the combination of the water and the tons of graphite , which traps neutrons in the reactors to support the chain reaction. // In the United States , only one commercial reactor , in Colorado , uses graphite as a neutron moderator . But neither the Colorado unit nor most Western graphite reactors use ordinary water ; they are cooled by an inert gas . Canadian reactors use graphite and a different kind of water , heavy water , as a coolant , a design that avoids the Soviet problem , Soviet Plans Are Given The Russians want to add control rods to keep the reactor from running away and to add a system that allows a faster shutdown in an emergency . They also want to change the fuel composition. // Experts from the United States and Western Europe said the improvements would still not prevent the reactor from running away under certain accident conditions . They said the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The experts suggested that the Russians should remove some of the nuclear fuel and graphite from their reactors , put in special devices to prevent operators from shutting off emergency systems , and add more steel and concrete around their reactors to contain radiation in an accident. // But the experts conceded that all these changes might be too costly for the reactors to be economical . They added that operator training must be substantially improved. // " The Soviets have taken some initial steps , the more obvious ones , but we are still not satisfied , " an American said . <> <> ' A Bit of an Impasse ' // An engineer for the European Community said , " We are at a bit of an impasse here. " // Most of those interviewed declined to be identified by name , saying that they did not want to hurt professional relationships with Soviet colleagues. // The Western experts said the Russians had not provided enough detail about the layout of the control room , its instrumentation and accident data . The experts said the Soviet scientists also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reactor operation. // " We need a lot more detail , " an American said. // The Western delegates complained that the International Atomic Energy Agency had consolidated hundreds of specific questions into broader groups that did not yield the needed answers. // " I am disappointed , " said Richard T. Kennedy , the permanent United States delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency . " I thought our questions were aggregated to a level that was generally not useful. " // He also complained about the Russians ' questions about Western programs. // " I thought the point was for us to find out about the Soviet program , " he said. // Dr. Morris Rosen , director of nuclear safety for the International Atomic Energy Agency , said the agency decided that general questions would best promote discussion . A total of 570 questions were reduced to 75 , he said . <> <> Shift in Soviet Emphasis // Western experts said the Russians seem to have decided to phase out reactors similar to the Chernobyl type and build more of the Western type. // " Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is that the Chernobyl reactor and others like it are based on design decisions made 20 years ago. " // The first large Soviet commercial reactor of the graphite type , a 100-megawatt unit , went into operation in 1964 at the Beloyarsky nuclear plant at Zarechny in the Urals . The graphite reactors now being built in the Soviet Union are 10 times more powerful , with a capacity of 1 , 000 megawatts. // A disagreement also arose today over medical treatment given to the victims of Chernobyl . The issue involved the bone marrow transplants given to 13 of the victims by Dr. Robert Gale of California . The Soviet report noted that nine of the patients had died , and two of them might have died because of the transplants. // The transplants were said to be needed because radiation can kill the marrow , which produces blood cells . However , transplanted marrow may cause the radiation victim to reject the donated tissue or develop fatal disease associated with the transplant. // The Soviet report said that the number of radiation victims who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that transplants might actually have a negative effect on some patients with high radiation doses . The Russians called this a new finding. // Dr. Gale , who is attending the symposium , said in an interview that he disagreed with the Soviet interpretation . He said the reason the Chernobyl patients died was that most had suffered other ailments such as severe radiation burns from fighting fires inside the reactor building. // He also said that it was not a new finding that marrow transplants could have negative effects and that the treatment should not be viewed as a panacea . " It is moderately effective , " he said . Dr. Gale said that besides the 31 people who died as a result of the explosion , including two men killed fighting the fire , and the 203 who were hospitalized with serious radiation sickness , 300 were hospitalized on suspicion of severe radiation poisoning . <> <> Debate Over Projected Deaths // Debate continued over the projected number of excess cancer and radiation deaths as a result of the Chernobyl accident . Western experts , using Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths over the next 70 years in a population of 75 million in the western Soviet Union . The normal number of cancer deaths would be 9. 5 million. // The Western experts also projected 2 , 000 excess cancer deaths for Europe outside the Soviet Union . Dr. Gale said the figure might be as high as 6 , 000. // Amerians at the symposium said that so far they saw no lessons for American reactors from the Chernobyl accident , but that they were going to re-examine safety priorities . They expressed particular interest in accidents in which the power rises so fast that an uncontrolled reaction occurs. // One American said a problem with Soviet reactor safety was the basic philosophy of the nuclear program : that economics and electricity production were paramount . He said it seemed as if that would be difficult to change. // Western nuclear officials said they hoped to follow up this week ' s meeting with continued pressure on the Soviet Union to improve reactor safety. //                @ @ @ @ @
