Too many risks and too little inspection in the coal mines ? <P> <P> Lillie Hamilton can look out the back window of her boxy clapboard house in Mink Branch , Ky. , and see the family business , a small coal mine burrowed into the hillside . One chill morning last month , seven men-including three of her sons and a grandson-were wedged 700 ft. down a narrow tunnel , crawling on their knees and blasting loose great chunks of bituminous coal with an explosive gel . Suddenly , a monstrous explosion shattered the Appalachian quiet . The Joyce Ann shaft ( named for a Hamilton widow ) had become a quarter-mile-long cannon , and the men inside fodder . Out of the hole in the hill roared thick black smoke , fire , machinery fragments and a flutter of paper currency , the money ripped from the pockets of the seven dead miners below . <P> In the past decade , the annual death count in coal mining , the country 's most dangerous industrial occupation , has dropped to fewer than 200 , down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement came from both technological advances and more stringent standards enforced by the Government since 1973 . But now the trend has taken a troubling upswing : mine mishaps killed 106 men in 1978 , 133 in 1980 and 155 last year . The Mink Branch disaster was one of seven major Kentucky mining accidents in seven weeks ; since the first of the year , 31 U.S. coal miners have been killed on the job . Says Willard Stanley , Kentucky 's Commissioner of Mines and Minerals : " Something is going wrong . " <P> In the view of the miners ' advocates , from United Mine Workers officials to Congressmen who represent the impoverished Appalachian valleys , what is going wrong is the Government 's system of policing . There are at least 250 fewer federal mine enforcement officials than in 1978 , yet hundreds of new mines to oversee . In coal-rich Logan County , W. Va. , for instance , the local Mine Safety and Health Administration inspection staff has dropped from 33 to eleven , and of the county 's 91 mines due to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . U.M.W. Safety Officer Donald Fleming detects a more insidious form of neglect . " The word is out , " he says . " If you 're a mine operator , it 's not too hard to read between the lines : the mine inspector is someone you can ignore . " <P> Yet , after intense lobbying by the U.M.W. , the Reagan Administration this month agreed to end the two-year-old MSHA hiring freeze and rehire nine furloughed inspectors . The White House further agreed to ask for an 11% increase in MSHA 's 1983 budget , to $154 million-exactly its funding in the Carter Administration 's last budget and enough to expand the enforcement staff from 1,700 to 1,900 , nearly up to its 1978 level . Ford B. Ford , the Assistant Secretary of Labor in charge of MSHA , denies that Reagan 's antiregulatory philosophy has demoralized inspectors and reduced the number and quality of inspections . " I have not sent out any signals to overlook things , " he says . Yet Ford does admit to a new , looser approach to mine safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Enforcement is not the total key .
