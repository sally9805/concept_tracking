It 's a warm , sunny day in Southern California , and at the Vic Braden Tennis College in Coto de Caza , 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles , a few dozen students are watching a most peculiar exhibition . At one end of a tennis court , a ball machine flings one ball after another across the net . Seated on a chair on the opposite side , a short , chubby man , racquet in hand , rises to meet each one , hitting it squarely with a looping forehand . Thwack . Thwack . The balls whiz back over the net , landing just inside the base line . <P> Victor Kenneth Braden , 60 , has a point to make . " See what you can do when you bend your knees and then lift with your thighs as you hit the ball ? " he asks his students . The imagery is vivid , but one woman remains dubious . " My knees do n't bend that much , " she says . " That 's strange , " Vic responds impishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant last night ? How did you get into that position ? Did the waiter hit you in the back of the knees ? " <P> The woman nods , getting the point , laughing . Her classmates laugh , and Braden joins in . Laughter , in fact , is an essential part of the curriculum at the tennis college , where every year several thousand adults take three-to- five-day courses that cost $100 daily . It erupts regularly from the classroom during Braden 's unique lectures , which combine show biz , science , humor and psychology . It rings out on the 17 courts and the 18 teaching lanes equipped with ball machines  --  and in the four video rooms , where students guffaw as they view tapes of their own just completed drills . Even the pro shop is involved . It carriesT shirts bearing the slogan LAUGH AND WIN . <P> Laughing all the way , Braden has become a celebrity in the sports world . Jack Kramer , the 1947 Wimbledon champion , calls him " the world 's best all- around tennis coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beginner to a champion . " Braden was featured on the cover of the August issue of Tennis magazine . In television commercials he is touting Tennis Our Way , a videotape he made with Arthur Ashe and Stan Smith , and millions of sports fans have chuckled at his commentaries on cable and network TV . The best known of his five books , Vic Braden 's Tennis for the Future , has sold 200,000 copies . <P> Still , Braden has his detractors . While quick to praise able coaches , he is disliked , and as he admits , " even hated " by many others . They resent his criticism , his intrusion into what they think is their turf , and his systematic discrediting of some of their most cherished teaching methods . <P> But Braden has never met a sport he did n't like . He runs a ski college in Aspen , and has made volleyball and badminton instructional videotapes . Using high-speed cameras and computers , he has analyzed and critiqued the techniques of such star athletes as baseball 's Reggie Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( discus throw ) and Edwin Moses ( hurdles ) . In tennis , his coaching helped launch the careers of Tracy Austin , Eliot Teltscher and Jim Pugh ( a mixed-doubles winner at Wimbledon this year ) .
