Gooden said his agent , Jim Neader , talked with the Mets about a multiyear contract , but team policy is not to give more than one-year deals to players with little big-league experience . " We talked specifically about one- , two- and three-year deals , and generally about five- and six-year deals , " Neader said .

Al Harazin , the Mets ' senior vice president , said he felt the team could have won its arbitration case against Gooden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the team shied away from including incentive clauses because " you end up paying for them twice .

Before this year , the Royals had been involved in just four arbitration cases since the system began in 1974 . The team had lost only once , to first baseman Willie Aikens in 1982 . General manager John Schuerholz was asked if he thought that winning the World Series has had a bearing on the cases . " It is an emotional factor in the equation , " he said .
