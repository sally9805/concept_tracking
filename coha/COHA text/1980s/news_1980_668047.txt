OK , all ye Doomsday Prophets , return to your woodwork . The Bruins are remarkably healthy , and the reports of their early departure from the playoffs were both premature and exaggerated . But remember , the Bruins still have to win two out of three to get past the annoying first round and the Pittsburgh Penguins . The Bruins evened their best-of-five series at one game apiece with a very disciplined 4-1 victory at the Garden last night before 11,677 . They are in the good hands of coach Harry Sinden and goalie Gerry Cheevers . It was Sinden who settled them down after a scoreless first period that loomed ominously , especially after Tuesday ' s game . It was Cheevers who gave them " a little bit of heck in the third period when we were cruising , " according to Brad Park . The Bruins won the game they had to win with a three-goal second period and an overall control of the game that was " neither too cautious nor too gambling , " said Sinden . And now they are off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , both at 8:05 p.m . ( Ch. 38 , WITS ) . Boston got the goal it needed from Rick Middleton early in the second period on a play that began 180 feet away from the Pittsburgh goal , at the Boston goal line . Park beat Rick Kehoe to the puck there and then faked him so effectively with a little move that Kehoe fell down and slid into the boards . Mike Milbury had swung to the right side , and Park passed the puck up to him quickly , near the Boston blue line . Middleton " came off his wing , cutting to the center of the ice and he timed it perfectly , " according to Milbury , who also timed his pass just as perfectly . It caught Middleton as he was cutting between defensemen Ron Stackhouse and Bob Stewart , and Middleton flew down the slot with the puck on his stick . End to end with two passes . " The goalie ( Greg Millen ) came out so fast he was totally out of position , " said Middleton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just didn ' t want to lose it off my stick . It was a bad percentage play on his part . I don ' t think he likes breakaways . Me ? I love them . " So Middleton backhanded the puck easily into the goal , and the Bruins had that critical first goal of the game , which was their target . It came at 1:42 , and the Bruins added two more goals in the period , 20 minutes of absolute dominance that saw them outshoot Pittsburgh , 22-5 . Then a funny thing happened . That second period , that 3-0 lead , should have chased Pittsburgh out of its defensive posture . It didn ' t , and the Penguins behaved like a team that had reached its objective two nights earlier . Maybe their target was to win one game in Boston . They won Tuesday , 4-2 . Said Craig MacTavish of the Bruins : " The way they played at 2-0 , I thought they had quit . . . that they had Tuesday ' s win and that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tough enough to put the Bruins on the brink of frustration after last night ' s scoreless first period . " Harry ( Sinden ) settled us down after the first period , " said Park . " He told us the scoring chances would come . He told us to continue playing the same way . " Said Sinden : " We talked about being very careful offensively ; not to be too anxious , not to be too cautious . I thought Brad McCrimmon and Ray Bourque and all our defensemen played an excellent game . We played with excellent discipline . " Boston ' s second goal of the game came from Don Marcotte , who was taking a regular shift for the first time in four games , or since he returned from knee surgery performed on Dec. 11 . There was magic in this goal , too , with Peter McNab making a trick play at center ice to get control of a pass from Terry O ' Reilly and then making a backhand pass to Marcotte in front . " The puck was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of backhanded it around my body and turned and went with it . " He cut to the right , " and there was Marcotte streaming down the slot , " said McNab . He backhanded the puck to Marcotte . " I didn ' t think I was going to reach it , " Marcotte said . But he did and chopped it up into the middle of the goal . Park slapped the puck by Millen from 40 feet out , just behind the right faceoff circle , for Boston ' s third goal at 11:41 of the second period . " I couldn ' t see the net or the goalie , " said Park , " and I don ' t think he could see me . " Wayne Cashman scored Boston ' s fourth goal early in the third period before Rod Schutt tallied Pittsburgh ' s only goal at 12:16 . " I think we played better Tuesday , " said Cashman . A funny game , hockey .                 @ @ @ @
