It was not a perfect launch day at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia . Winds were gusting ; a cyclone was reportedly moving in from the Aral Sea . The temperature was near freezing . Flight officials held an urgent meeting , then made their decision : it was a go . Minutes later the Soviet Union 's first space shuttle rose , unmanned , out of a giant fireball that spread over the steppe . Looking much like its U.S. counterpart , the white- tiled , double-delta-winged vehicle , called Buran ( Snowstorm ) , made two orbits around the earth , then executed a perfect automated landing a few miles from where it had blasted off . Total flight time : 3 hours 25 minutes . <P> " The space plane has ushered in a new era in the history of Soviet space exploration , " trumpeted Radio Moscow . Western observers were no less admiring . " This shows that the Russians ' boldness and ambition is matched by their ingenuity , " says James Oberg , a Houston engineer and an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of our last space-operations monopoly . " The Soviet program achieved a second milestone just a few days earlier : on board the orbiting Mir space station , which has no U.S. equivalent , cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov broke the world record of 326 days in space . <P> Buran 's triumphant maiden voyage came after several glitches in the Soviet space program . The first attempt to put the shuttle into orbit was scrubbed last month with only 51 seconds left in the countdown . Worse , a Soviet-Afghan crew was nearly lost in space last September due to a computer malfunction . <P> Despite some obvious similarities , the Soviet orbiter is a different bird from the U.S. species . Its wing angle and nose are sharper , perhaps giving it greater maneuverability . More important , as demonstrated last week , it is set % up for fully automated flight . Onboard computers can guide it through re- entry to the earth 's atmosphere and landing . The ship is also capable of manned flight , carrying up to ten people , but the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew on board . " Just as we were scared to death by Chernobyl , " explains a Western diplomat in Moscow , " they were scared to death when Challenger blew up . " <P> Another significant difference in the shuttle systems concerns the boosters . The U.S. orbiter is lifted by two recoverable solid rocket boosters and its own three main engines , a system designed exclusively for shuttle missions . Buran piggybacks on the l97-ft. - high Energia , the world 's largest operational booster rocket  --  a multipurpose powerhouse designed to lift shuttles or unmanned spacecraft weighing up to 100 tons . " Energia could be said to be a much smarter system than what we 've got , since it could take anything up , " says Seth Arenstein , editor of Soviet Aerospace magazine . <P> The question facing Soviet leaders is how to use this new toy and how to justify its cost . Its real utility , say experts , will be linked to the next- generation Soviet space station . In a tight economic environment , the cost of that project and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompting some second thoughts . Despite the successes , says John Pike , director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists , " the glasnost-perestroika crowd is somewhat down on aerospace . "
