Say it ai n't so , Mr. Volcker . Tell us that the reports we 've been reading  --  that you have stopped smoking cigars  --  are n't true . How will unimaginative journalists be able to describe you if they ca n't write , " Paul Volcker , the towering 6-ft. 7-in. , cigar-smoking chairman of the Federal Reserve Board " ? How will you blow enough smoke to shroud your policies in secrecy ? How do we know that going cold turkey wo n't make you irritable and prone to raising interest rates ? Sure , we realize that it will be good for your health to give up those 28-cent Antonio y Cleopatra Grenadiers . But consider this momentous step carefully . Trademarks should not be abandoned lightly .
