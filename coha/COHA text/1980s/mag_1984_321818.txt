Helms stays , Percy goes , and youthful newcomers march in <P> For downcast Democrats , the results of Senate races provided the one swath of cheerful news . The party did not regain the majority control it lost in 1980 , but the power has shifted a solid bit its way . The net gain of two seats will reduce the G.O.P. majority to 53 to 47 . Moreover , the ideological tilt will be even greater than the simple partisan tally indicates , since the two lost Republican seats are going , in effect , to liberal Democrats . Because of the shift , the Senate is more likely to slip back under Democratic sway in 1986 , when almost twice as many Republicans as Democrats will be running for reelection . The results also showed the rise to power of a new generation . Three of the five freshman Democratic Senators-John Kerry of Massachusetts , Tom Harkin of Iowa and Albert Gore Jr . of Tennessee-are Viet Nam veterans . <P> This was a good year to be an incumbent , and only three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few others had to fight . James Exon , 63 , the Nebraska Democrat , won a tough race against Nancy Hoch , 48 , an earnest , moderate Republican and one of nine women who challenged incumbents-all unsuccessfully . Contesting an open seat in Texas , Republican Phil Gramm , 42 , badly beat Liberal Lloyd Doggett , 38 . <P> Of the surviving incumbents , the most scrutinized was Jesse Helms . No major American political figure arouses stronger feelings than Helms , 63 . Millions of Americans reject his ferocious New Right ideology , while millions of others share his many resentments-of Government , of feminism , blacks and modern life itself . At home in North Carolina , Helms ' antagonists were in the minority : he was re-elected to his third Senate term against Moderate James B. Hunt Jr. , 47 , the state 's outgoing Governor , with 53% of the vote . <P> The election concerned the Senate only nominally . Both sides cast the race as a stark moral referendum . Helms called his right-wing philosophy " the cause of a Christian nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to say what kind of people we are " and spoke darkly of the " radical right wing " that a Helms triumph would encourage to " take over this country . " As Hunt politicked Tuesday night at a Raleigh polling place , he had a final , frustrating , emblematic campaign encounter . A young woman declined to shake his hand . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " but I 'm a Christian , and I 'm voting for your opposition . " As she walked away , Hunt cried out , " You do n't think anyone else is a Christian ? "
