Do n't mess around with Mother Irony , they tell one another now at the Caf Babar . When the phone rings , no one wants to answer it . Although it is more than a year since Joe Troise and Bill Glanting and the others had their big idea , the caller is more than likely to be some reporter or talk-show crocodile wanting to know about the Dull Men 's Club . Dullness had everyone excited there for a while , and it kept things jumping among the regulars at the caf , a neighborhood beer-and-sandwich joint in San Francisco 's Mission District . Now everyone is bored , though . The T shirts finally came , but no one feels like wearing them . Dullness has lost its madcap charm . <P> " It just sort of petered out , " says Glanting , who was publicity chairman of the club back when it needed one . There is silence . The reporter writes down Glanting 's remark . More silence . Glanting is finding it hard to get up steam . He has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can no longer recite the club motto- " Dare to be dull . " Lines like " We 're out of it and proud of it " and " There 's nothing wrong with being an ordinary stupid guy " no longer come trippingly to his tongue . <P> Ah , but in the beginning ... He and Troise and half a dozen of their friends were sitting around the caf on a night like any other night , waiting for Boswell and Dr. Johnson to arrive , when the talk turned to the frantic trendiness of U.S. society . Go to a cocktail party , someone said , and everybody 's talking about manipulating the money market , or parachute jumping , or that group therapy where everybody sits nude in a big tub of Wesson Oil . Yeah , said another citizen , there you are in your clean bowling shirt and they all want to go to the roller disco . " People think they have to be able to discuss everything , enjoy everything . They have an irrational impulse to be interesting . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his International Dull Day proclamation last Oct. 16 . ) That was the kind of folderol that used to fill the air of the Cafe Babar . <P> " Shall we , the good and dull of the earth , attempt to compete with the attention getters ? " " Hurray for meat loaf ! " " People who hang-glide are nuts ! " " Yeah , you know what 's fun , by God ? Petting your dog , tuning up the old Chevy Nova . " " More beer ! " " Beer here ! "
