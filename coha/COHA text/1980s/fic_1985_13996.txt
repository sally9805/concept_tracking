JAKE , upstage left on suspended platform , suitcase beside him , standing at a blue payphone on highway , talking into it . Pale yellow full moon extreme upstage right center . Impression of huge dark space and distance between the two characters with each one isolated in his own pool of light . Their voices are heard , first in pitch black .

Lights up fast on BETH downstage left as she sits up straight with a jerk as though awakened by a nightmare . She is in a white hospital bed covered with a sheet . She wears a blue hospital smock . Her head is wrapped in bandages . Her face badly bruised , eyes black and blue . Her brother , MIKE , stands behind her upstage of bed , arm around her shoulder , stroking her back . She tries to speak but no words come , just short punctuated sounds at the end of her rapid exhales .

MIKE tries to stop her but she continues tearing the bandage off . ) BETH ( As she rips off bandage ) Ghaah  --  ghaah  --  khaah  --  khaah  --  khaah  --  ( Continues ) p. 6 MIKE No , leave that on . Leave it , Beth . You 're supposed to leave it on for a while . Do n't take that off . BETH ( Still pulling bandage off ) Am I a mummy now ? Am I a mummy ? Am I ? Am I now ?

BETH feels her head . ) Whaaza plase where I fell ? Who fell me ? p. 7 MIKE ( Holding her ) You 're okay . ( Both BETH 's arms shoot straight up above her head .

Moon stays full but turns pale green. ) p. 9 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 Soft orange light up on stage-right platform , revealing small ragged motel couch with a floor lamp beside it . Main light source emanating from lamp . A wooden chair opposite couch . JAKE 's suitcase on floor with clothes spilled out of it . JAKE sits in middle of couch , legs apart , slouched forward , holding his head in his hands . FRANKIE stands behind couch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the back of JAKE 's neck . JAKE keeps pushing the ice away . JAKE ( Shoving ice away ) I do n't want any goddamn ice ! It 's cold ! FRANKIE I thought it might help . JAKE Well , it do n't . It 's cold . FRANKIE I know it 's cold . It 's ice . It 's supposed to be cold . ( Pause ) ( FRANKIE goes to chair . Sits . Silence between them for a while . ) You did n't actually kill her , did ya , Jake ? ( JAKE stays seated . Starts slow , low , deliberate . ) JAKE She was goin ' to these goddamn rehearsals every day . Every day . Every single day . Hardly ever see her . I saw enough though . Believe you me . Saw enough to know somethin ' was goin ' on . p. 10 FRANKIE But you did n't really kill her , did ya ? JAKE ( Builds ) I 'm no dummy . Does n't take much to put it together . Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out . Starts puttin ' on more and more smells . Oils . She was always oiling herself before she went out . Every morning . Smell would wake me up . Coconut or Butterscotch or some goddamn thing . Sweet stuff . Youda thought she was an ice-cream sundae . I 'd watch her oiling herself while I pretended to be asleep . She was in a dream , the way she did it . Like she was imagining someone else touching her . Not me . Never me . Someone else . FRANKIE Who ? JAKE ( Stands , moves around space , gains momentum ) Some guy . I do n't know . Some actor-jerk . I knew she was gettin ' herself ready for him . I could tell . Got worse and worse . When I finally called her on it she denied it flat . I knew she was lying too . Could tell it right away . The way she took it so light . Tried to cast it off like it was nothin ' . Then she starts tellin ' me it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd cooked up in my head . Had nothin ' to do with her , she said . Made me try to believe I was crazy . She 's all innocent and I 'm crazy . So I told her  --  I told her  --  I laid it on the line to her . Square business . I says  --  no more high heels ! No more wearin ' them high spiky high heels to rehearsals . No more a ' that shit . And she laughs . Right to my face . She laughs . Kept puttin ' ' em on . Every mornin ' . Puttin ' ' em back on . She says it 's right for the part . Made her feel like the character she says . Then I told her she had to wear a bra and she paid no attention to that either . You could see right through her damn blouse . Right clean through it . And she never wore underpants either . That 's what really got me . No underpants . You could see everything . p. 11 FRANKIE Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( JAKE stops , turns to FRANKIE . FRANKIE stays in chair . Pause . ) JAKE How do you know ? FRANKIE No , I mean  --  I think you told me once . JAKE ( Moving slowly toward FRANKIE ) I never told you that . I never woulda told you a thing like that . That 's personal . FRANKIE ( Backing up ) No , I think you did once  --  when you were drunk or somethin ' . JAKE ( Close to FRANKIE ) I never woulda told you that ! FRANKIE All right . ( Pause ) JAKE I never talked about her that way to anybody . FRANKIE Okay . Forget it . Just forget it . JAKE You always liked her , did n't you , Frankie ? Do n't think I over-looked that . FRANKIE Are you gon na finish tellin ' me what happened ? ' Cause if you 're not I 'm gon na take a walk right outa here . ( Pause . JAKE considers , then launches back into the story. ) p. 12 JAKE ( Returns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the lines with me , at night . In bed . Readin ' the lines . I 'm helpin ' her out , right ? Helpin ' her memorize the damn lines so she can run off every morning and say ' em to some other guy . Day after day . Same lines . And these lines are all about how she 's bound and determined to get this guy back in the sack with her after all these years he 's been ignoring her . How she still loves him even though he hates her . How she 's saving her body up for him and him only . FRANKIE Well , it was just a play , was n't it ? JAKE Yeah , a play . That 's right . Just a play . " Pretend . " That 's what she said . " Just pretend . " I know what they were doing ! I know damn well what they were doin ' ! I know what that acting shit is all about . They try to " believe " they 're the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person that they actually think they become the person . So you know what that means do n't ya ? FRANKIE What ? JAKE They start doin ' all the same stuff the person does ! FRANKIE What person ? JAKE The person ! The  --  whad'ya call it ? The  --  FRANKIE Character ? p. 13 JAKE Yeah . The character . That 's right . They start acting that way in real life . Just like the character . Walkin ' around  --  talkin ' that way . You shoulda seen the way she started to walk and talk . I could n't believe it . Changed her hair and everything . Put a wig on . Changed her clothes . Everything changed . She was unrecognizable . I did n't even know who I was with anymore . I told her . I told her , look  --  " I do n't know who you think you are now but I 'd just as soon you come on back to the real world here . " And you know what she tells me ? FRANKIE What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This acting shit is more real than the real world to her . Can you believe that ? And she was tryin ' to convince me that I was crazy ? ( Pause ) FRANKIE So you think she was sleeping with this guy just because she was playing a part in a play ? JAKE Yeah . She was real dedicated . FRANKIE Are you sure ? I mean when would she have time to do that in rehearsals ? JAKE On her lunch break . FRANKIE ( Stands ) Oh , come on , Jake . JAKE Sit down ! Sit back down . I got more to tell you . p. 14 FRANKIE No ! I 'm not gon na sit down ! I came to try to help you out and all you 're tellin ' me is a bunch of bullshit about Beth screwing around with some other guy on her lunch break ? JAKE She was ! It 's easy to tell when a woman gets obsessed with somethin ' else . When she moves away from you . They do n't hide it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a good job . JAKE That 's no job ! I 've had jobs before . I know what a job is . A job is where you work . A job is where you do n't have fun . You do n't dick around tryin ' to pretend you 're somebody else . You work . Work is work ! FRANKIE It 's a different kind of a job . JAKE It 's an excuse to fool around ! That 's what it is . That 's why she wanted to become an actress in the first place . So she could get away from me . FRANKIE You ca n't jump to that kind of conclusion just because she was  --  JAKE I did n't jump to nothin ' ! I knew what she was up to even if she did n't . FRANKIE So , you mean you 're accusing her of somethin ' she was n't even aware of ? JAKE She was aware all right . She was tryin ' to hide it from me but she was n't that good an actress . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Boy , I 'm tellin ' you  --  JAKE I killed her . ( Pause ) FRANKIE You killed her . JAKE That 's right . FRANKIE She stopped breathing ? JAKE Everything stopped . FRANKIE You checked ? JAKE I did n't have to check . FRANKIE She might 've just been unconscious or something . JAKE No . FRANKIE Well , what 'd you do ? Did you tell the police ? JAKE Why would I do that ? She was already dead . What could they do about it ? FRANKIE That 's what you 're supposed to do when somebody dies . You report it to the police . JAKE Even when you kill ' em ? FRANKIE Yeah ! Even when you kill them . Especially when you kill them ! JAKE I never heard a ' that . ( Pause ) FRANKIE Well , somebody should check up on it . I mean this is pretty serious stuff , Jake . p. 16 JAKE I done my time for her . I already done my time . FRANKIE She had nothin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me in trouble more'n once . She did it on purpose too . Always flirtin ' around . Always carryin ' on . FRANKIE She had nothin ' to do with it ! You lost your temper . JAKE She provoked it ! FRANKIE You 've always lost your temper and blamed it on somebody else . Even when you were a kid you blamed it on somebody else . One time you even blamed it on a goat . I remember that . ( Pause . JAKE stops . ) JAKE What goat ? FRANKIE That milk goat we had . JAKE What was her name ? FRANKIE I forget . JAKE What was that goat 's name ? FRANKIE You remember that goat ? JAKE Yeah , I remember that goat . I loved that goat . FRANKIE Well you kicked the shit out of that goat you loved so much when she stepped on your bare feet while you were tryin ' to milk her . You remember that ? Broke her ribs . p. 17 JAKE I never kicked that goat ! FRANKIE Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot you kicked her so hard . JAKE What was that goat 's name ? ( JAKE suddenly falls to the floor , collapses . FRANKIE goes to him . Tries to help him . ) Get away from me ! FRANKIE What happened ? JAKE Just get away ! FRANKIE You all right ? JAKE Somethin 's wrong . My head 's funny . FRANKIE ( Trying to help JAKE up ) Come on , let 's get you back on the couch . JAKE ( Pushing FRANKIE away , crawls on knees toward couch ) I do n't need any help ! FRANKIE You feel dizzy or something ? JAKE ( Crawling to couch ) Yeah . All of a sudden . Everything 's  --  FRANKIE You want me to get you something ? JAKE ( Climbing up on couch and lying on his belly ) No . I do n't need nothin ' . p. 18 FRANKIE You want me to get a doctor for you ? JAKE I 'm gon na die without her . I know I 'm gon na die . ( Pause ) FRANKIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd know what happened to her . JAKE No ! You stay away from there ! Do n't go anywhere near there . I 'm through chasin ' after her . FRANKIE Somebody 's got ta find out , Jake . Sooner or later . ( Pause . JAKE speaks in a whisper , almost to himself . His whole tone changes . Very vulnerable , as though questioning a ghost . ) JAKE Now . Why now ? Why am I missing her now , Frankie ? Why not then ? When she was there ? Why am I afraid I 'm gon na lose her when she 's already gone ? And this fear  --  this fear swarms through me  --  floods my whole body till there 's nothing left . Nothing left of me . And then it turns  --  It turns to a fear for my whole life . Like my whole life is lost from losing her . Gone . That I 'll die like this . Lost . Just lost . FRANKIE It 's okay , Jake . JAKE You liked her too , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . ( Pause ) p. 19 JAKE My back 's like ice . How come my back 's so cold ? FRANKIE ( Moves right ) I 'll get you a blanket . JAKE No ! Do n't leave . FRANKIE ( Stops ) All right . ( Pause ) You okay ? JAKE Yeah . Just sit with me for a while . Stay here . FRANKIE ( Goes to chair , pulls it near couch ) Okay . ( FRANKIE sits in chair next to couch . JAKE stays on his belly , arm hanging limply over the side of couch , hand touching the floor . ) JAKE Do n't leave . FRANKIE I wo n't . ( Lights dim to black. ) p. 20 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 Lights up extreme left on MIKE trying to help BETH walk . Her arm is around his neck . His arm around her waist and the other hand holding her hand . Her legs are very weak and keep going out from under her periodically . Sometimes he reaches down and moves one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stops now and then , breathing hard from the effort . She watches her bare feet the whole time , then once in a while her head jerks up and stares at the ceiling , then back down to her feet again  --  similar to the head movements of a blind person . The two of them keep struggling to walk in circles like this as they speak . BETH 's voice now is very childlike and small . BETH ( As she walks ) You won ' hurd him , Mige . Yera kineness . Alla kineness . In for nah to me . Fine I kim it . MIKE ( Helping her walk ) Just try to keep moving . That 's it . You 're doing great . BETH Yera kineness , Mige . I 'm onah too . Fo fo nahchoo .

Do n't you want to get better ? ( BETH shakes her head defiantly , stays folded up . ) Do n't you want to get back home ? ( Suddenly BETH pulls away from MIKE , takes a few steps on her own and falls . MIKE goes to her fast and picks her back up on her feet. ) p. 22 BETH ( Savage ) NO ! DON ' TUSH ME ! MIKE ( Holding her up as she struggles ) I have to hold you up , Beth , or you 'll fall over . BETH DON ' TUSH ME ! I won ' fall ! I won ' . MIKE All right . If you want to stand on your own , that 's great . BETH I won ' . MIKE Okay . ( MIKE cautiously lets go of her and stands back a couple steps , ready to catch her if she topples .

Couch and lamp , suitcase , clothes , etc . But now more of the area is lit in front and to the sides of the couch with the couch remaining in very dim light . Just able to make out the shape of JAKE lying belly down still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket , arm still dangling out over the side . FRANKIE , his sister , SALLY , and their mother , LORRAINE , enter fast from upstage right of platform and cross down center into middle neutral territory . Scene is played out down center for a while . FRANKIE ( On the move , entering from up right ) Just try to keep your voice down , Mom . This is the first time he 's slept since I 've seen him . LORRAINE Do n't be so damn bossy . FRANKIE Well , he has n't slept . LORRAINE I just wan na take a look at him is all . SALLY Mom  --  FRANKIE He 's not lookin ' too good right now , Mom . LORRAINE What'sa matter with him ? FRANKIE He 's lost a whole bunch of weight . p. 26 LORRAINE Well , I 'll make him up a batch a ' that cream of broccoli soup . That 'll put the weight back on him . That 's his favorite . FRANKIE He wo n't eat . LORRAINE Whad'ya mean he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate if you let him . Whad'ya been feedin ' him ? FRANKIE He 's in big trouble , Mom . LORRAINE So what 's new ? Name a day he was n't in trouble . He was trouble from day one . Fell on his damn head the second he was born . Slipped right through the doctor 's fingers . That 's where it all started . Back there . Had nothin ' to do with his upbringing . SALLY Mom , just listen to Frankie a second . He 's tryin ' to tell you somethin ' . LORRAINE I am listenin ' but I 'm not hearin ' no revelations ! What 's the story here ? My boy 's sick . I 'll make him some soup . We 'll take him out to the Drive-In .

I do n't keep track of his bimbos . SALLY Great . FRANKIE We 're not really sure about it yet , Mom . I mean  --  he 's pretty emotional about the whole thing . LORRAINE He 's an emotional boy . Always has been . SALLY He 's not a boy . He 's a big grown-up man and he might have killed his wife ! LORRAINE He was n't fit to live with anybody to begin with ! I do n't know why he ever tried it . Woman who lives with a man like that deserves to be killed . She deserves it . FRANKIE All right , knock it off ! Both a ' you ! We got ta think about this thing now . Jake 's the one who 's in trouble here , okay ? He 's in bad shape . You understand that ? He 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse .

She stops beside couch and swats JAKE hard on the rump . JAKE does n't move . FRANKIE and SALLY follow her onto platform . ) Jake ? Jake , it 's your mother . Sit up , boy . Sit up and lemme take a look at your tongue . Come on , now . Sit up and face me . ( JAKE rolls over slowly , facing out toward audience now . His face is pale white , eyes sunken and dark , radically changed from the last time he was seen . LORRAINE steps back . FRANKIE and SALLY move into couch area with LORRAINE . ) ( To FRANKIE ) What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmed over . p. 28 SALLY Jake ? ( JAKE just stares at them . ) LORRAINE ( To JAKE ) Your brother here 's been tryin ' to tell us that you 're gon na pass on us . Now quit the shenanigans and sit up . Jake ? Are you hearin ' me ? SALLY Just leave him be , Mom . LORRAINE He 's just playacting . Used to do this all the time when he did n't get his own way . Mope around for days like a cocker spaniel . Got so bad sometimes I finally had to take a bucket a ' ice cold rainwater and throw it right in his damn face . That worked every time . Maybe that 's what we ought a do right now . ( To FRANKIE ) You got a bucket ? FRANKIE I do n't think rainwater 's gon na do it , Mom . He 's had the chills for three days now . He just shakes all through the night . Talks to himself and shakes . LORRAINE It 's all pretend . He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves closer to JAKE . He smiles at her . ) SALLY Jake ? You feelin ' any better ? JAKE ( Soft , loving ) How 'd you ever get to be so beautiful ? SALLY ( Short laugh ) You never used to think that when we were kids . Least you never admitted it . You always called me the Crayfish . You remember ? p. 29 JAKE ( Slow , slurred ) We were never gon na be apart . SALLY Jake , you know who I am , do n't ya ? JAKE We were gon na be tied together . ( Laughs . ) You remember when I tied you to me . That one night . You tried sneakin ' off on me . In my sleep . Could n't do it , could ya ? Could n't . Had you tied . LORRAINE ( Moving to FRANKIE , taking him aside so JAKE ca n't hear . To FRANKIE ) Has he been drinkin ' or somethin ' ? FRANKIE No , I would n't buy him a bottle . Are you kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else killed . FRANKIE I 'm not gon na . LORRAINE Every time he gets near liquor he thinks it 's his God-given duty to keep pace with his old man . FRANKIE I know that . LORRAINE Do n't you dare buy him a bottle . FRANKIE I wo n't ! ( JAKE reaches out suddenly and grabs SALLY by the wrist . She pulls back but his grip is powerful . ) SALLY Jake , come on ! p. 30 LORRAINE ( Moving back to JAKE , to JAKE ) You let go a ' yer sister !

Your sister . Sally . Now let go a ' me , all right ? LORRAINE He knows who you are . Do n't you believe for one minute that he do n't know who you are . ( Approaching JAKE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her ! Let go of her right now . JAKE You never did see me , did ya , Beth ? Just had a big wild notion about some dream life up ahead . Somebody who was gon na save yer ass . ( JAKE starts to bear down on SALLY 's wrist now and drags her closer to him . ) SALLY ( Scared , struggling to get free ) I 'm not Beth , Jake ! Let go a ' me . Let go a ' me ! You 're hurtin ' me ! LORRAINE Let go a ' your sister ! ( LORRAINE takes off one of her shoes , charges JAKE and starts belting him over the head with it . JAKE keeps hold of SALLY 's wrist . FRANKIE moves in and pulls LORRAINE away from JAKE from behind . She starts to beat FRANKIE with the shoe now. ) p. 31 JAKE ( To SALLY ) I 'm gon na let go a ' you ! I 'm gon na let go a ' you once and for all ! ( JAKE drops SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist . JAKE 's arm falls limply to the floor again . His eyes close . He goes unconscious . LORRAINE stops beating FRANKIE with the shoe . FRANKIE lets go of her . They all stare at JAKE . ) LORRAINE That boy 's a maniac . Always has been . ( Pause ) What 's he doin ' now ? FRANKIE He 's out again . He goes in and out like that . All through the day . I do n't know what 's goin ' on with him . SALLY He 's crazy . He 's just plain crazy . LORRAINE We got ta get him outa here . He 's just goin ' to seed in this dump . It 's this place that 's doin ' it to him . SALLY We ca n't keep him at home , Mom . LORRAINE Why not ? That 's where he belongs . He belongs home . SALLY He 's dangerous ! That 's why ! LORRAINE He 's dyin ' here . SALLY He needs a doctor . LORRAINE He needs us is what he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple days , Mom , I could get back and find out what happened with Beth .

I 'm not even gon na let him outa his room for a solid year . Maybe that 'll teach him . SALLY What if he hurts somebody ? He 's liable to do anything in the state he 's in . LORRAINE He 's not gon na hurt us . We 're related . Look at him . He 's just a big baby . That 's all he is . He 's not gon na hurt us . Strangers he 'll hurt . Strange women .

This is my boy here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 SCENE 6 Lights up left . BETH 's bed upstage in very dim light , just able to make out her form lying with her face turned away from audience , almost the identical position and attitude of sleep as JAKE in previous scene . A small fold-out hospital screen in front of bed that can be seen through . The perimeters of the area are more fully lit , revealing MIKE , his mother , MEG , and his father , BAYLOR , downstage . BAYLOR What do ya mean , " brain damage " ? How can they prove somethin ' like that ? MIKE She had an X-ray , Dad . They 're not sure how bad it is yet . She 's having a lot of trouble talking . BAYLOR She gone crazy , or what ? MIKE No . She 's had an injury to the brain . You understand ? Does n't mean it 's permanent . Does n't mean she 's crazy either . BAYLOR Well , what the hell does it mean then ? " Injury to the brain " sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How in the world could a thing like this ever happen ? MIKE I told you , Mom . Jake beat her up . He beat the shit out of her . BAYLOR Watch your language . p. 34 MEG Who 's Jake ? MIKE Her husband , Mom . Jake . MEG Oh . MIKE You remember Jake , do n't ya ? MEG Was n't he the son of those people we do n't talk to anymore ? MIKE Yeah . That 's right . BAYLOR Bunch a ' Okies . Do n't surprise me one bit . MEG I think I do remember him . MIKE You were there at the wedding . MEG I was ? BAYLOR I was n't . MIKE ( To BAYLOR ) No , you stayed away . You made a point a ' that . BAYLOR I was fishin ' . MEG I think I do remember that . There was cars all over the place . Lots of cars . I kept wondering how come they had to park on the lawn . Why 'd they have to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't there a parking lot or anything ? BAYLOR Well , when 're we gon na be able to see her ? MIKE She 's sleeping right now . p. 35 BAYLOR Well , wake her up . We drove all the way down here from Billings just to see her . Now wake her up . MIKE I wish you 'd have called me or something before you came down . BAYLOR Why should I call you ? MIKE She 's having a kind of a rough time right now , Dad . She needs a lot of rest . BAYLOR Listen , I got two mules settin ' out there in the parkin ' lot I got ta deliver by midnight . I 'm supposed to be at the sale by six tomorrow mornin ' and those mules have to be in the stalls by midnight tonight . MIKE You brought mules down here ? BAYLOR Yeah . Why not ? Might as well do a little business long as I 'm gon na be down in this country anyway . That all right by you ? MEG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once we hit the city . Felt like such a hick . There we are pulling mules in an open trailer and everyone 's staring at us like we made a wrong turn or something . BAYLOR Looks like we did make a wrong turn if we ca n't even see our own daughter . What 's the story here , anyway ? They got her locked up or something ? MIKE This is a hospital , Dad . They do n't lock you up in a hospital . p. 36 BAYLOR Oh , they do n't huh . MEG They locked me up once , did n't they , Dad ? BAYLOR That was n't you . That was your mother . MEG Oh . BAYLOR That was a long time ago , anyhow . MEG It was n't me ? MIKE Maybe we could go down to the cafeteria and have some coffee or something . She might be awake by the time we get back . BAYLOR I ai n't gon na drink any a ' that damn hospital coffee . And I 'm not talkin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MIKE You do n't have to talk to any doctors . BAYLOR I did n't come all the way down here to be made a fool of in front of a bunch a ' college boys . MIKE Nobody 's interested in making a fool out of you , Dad . Beth 's sick . She needs attention . And everybody here is doing the best they can for her . BAYLOR Well , that sounds like ya do n't need us then . Sounds like you got all the bases covered here . Come on , Meg , let 's head back home then . ( BAYLOR takes MEG by the elbow ) MEG Well , we just got here , did n't we ? p. 37 BAYLOR I got ta get those mules out to the fairgrounds . Now let 's go . We 're wastin ' our time here . MIKE Dad , wait a second . There 's no reason to get offended . BAYLOR I 'm not offended ! What the hell , I 'm just a dumb rancher . What do I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain damage . " They got specialists for that . Ai n't that right ? They got boys back there with diplomas tall as a man . What am I supposed to know about it ? MIKE If you can just wait  --  if you can just stay for an hour or so  --  BAYLOR I ca n't wait . I got stock to feed . Now let 's go , Meg . MIKE Well , then , let Mom stay with me . Beth needs to see her . I 'll bring her back home in a few days . MEG That would be nice . ( Pause ) BAYLOR Where 's she supposed to stay ? MIKE She can stay with me . BAYLOR ( To MIKE ) How 're you gon na watch out for her and your sister both . That 's more'n one man can handle . More'n two men can handle . MIKE It 's not that big a problem . They 've got nurses here . p. 38 BAYLOR You 're gon na drive all the way back north with her ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way back up north ? MIKE Just let me worry about it , okay ? BAYLOR Well , what am I supposed to do , talk to myself all the way back home ? That 's a five-hundred-mile truck trip . MEG They got good radio between here and Billings , Dad . BAYLOR Good radio ? All they got is that Eddie Jackrabbit . You call that music . MEG I liked it . BAYLOR All right . All right . ( To MEG ) You wan na stay ? MEG I 'd like to . BAYLOR All right . ( To MIKE ) How many days you think it 'll be ? MIKE Two or three . MEG I 'll be fine , Baylor . BAYLOR You 'll be fine . You 'll be fine . Sure . All right . I 'll go out and get your jacket out of the truck . Be right back . MEG I wo n't need it . BAYLOR ( As he exits ) You 'll need it . You always need it . ( BAYLOR exits . MEG turns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( BETH suddenly rolls over facing audience . Spotlight on her face . The rest of her body in dim light . ) BETH Mom ? ( Blackout ) p. 40 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE 7 Lights up upstage right . JAKE , propped up with pillows , facing audience in a single bed that 's now too short for him . He 's in boxer underwear and a sleeveless T-shirt now and covered with an old Mexican blanket . Face even whiter than before , sunken eyes , hair slicked back as if he 's just had a shower . Plastic model airplanes covered in dust and cobwebs of World War Two fighters and bombers hang from the ceiling directly above the bed . LORRAINE sits beside him on a chair stage left of bed , spoon-feeding him from a bowl of her cream of broccoli soup . JAKE refuses to eat . LORRAINE ( Holding spoon of soup at his mouth ) Here now , come on . Just try a sip . That 's all I 'm askin ' . Just a simple sip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll work up to that slow . Just a little tiny old sip for now . Jake ? ( Harder ) Sit up here and drink this soup ! I 'm sick of babyin ' you . This is your favorite . Cream of broccoli . I made it special in the blender . ( Pause . JAKE refuses soup . ) I do n't know why in the world you insist on gettin ' so worked up over a woman . Look at you . I have never in my life seen you lookin ' so let-down . You musta lost a good thirty , forty pounds . A woman ai n't worth that kind of a loss . Believe you me . There 's more pretty girls than one in this world . Not that she was such a looker . I ca n't even remember what she looked like to tell you the truth , but she couldn'ta been all that great . You 'll find someone else sooner or later . You 're a strong , strappin ' man yet . Got a little age on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong frame . Your daddy was still lookin ' good at the age of sixty , even though the bottle had walked across his face a few times over . His face was a mess , I 'll admit that . I 'll be the first to admit that . But he still had that big stout frame on him , just like you got . Still managed to twirl my ticket , I 'll tell ya that much . Somebody 's bound to come along , just dyin ' to be encircled by them big bony arms . Do n't you worry about that one bit . Now , come on , just try this soup . Just do me a little favor , all right ? Do you want me to play helicopter with it like we used to ? ( She raises the spoon of soup over his head and starts making helicopter sounds as JAKE watches the spoon from below. ) p. 41 LORRAINE ( In a pinched cartoon voice ) Man overboard ! Man overboard ! Looks like he could be drownin ' ! Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wan na lose him now . ( JAKE suddenly knocks the spoon out of her hand and sends it flying . He rips the blanket and sheet off himself , grabs the bowl out of her hand , stands on the bed , holds the bowl high above his head and sends it crashing down on the mattress . Then he begins to stomp on the soup , jumping all over the bed , exhaling loudly and grunting like a buffalo . LORRAINE backs off fast and stands there watching him . JAKE finally expends all his energy and just stands there limply on the bed , bent forward at the waist , arms dangling and gasping for air . ) LORRAINE ( Away from him , keeping her distance ) What in the name of Judas Priest is the matter with you , boy ! I spent hours makin ' that stuff . I slaved over the blender tryin ' to get it creamy and smooth , just how you like it ! Look what you 've done to that soup ! ( JAKE looks down at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . ) Look what you 've done to your bed . ( She moves toward bed . ) JAKE ( Staying on bed ) STAY AWAY FROM MY BED ! ( LORRAINE stops . Pause . They stare at each other. ) p. 42 LORRAINE You got everybody buffaloed , do n't ya ? Everybody 's worried sick that you 've gone off yer cake , but you do n't fool me one bit . You scared your sister so damn bad she quit the house . JAKE Sally ? Where 'd she go ? LORRAINE She left . I do n't know where . Just packed up and left . Probably just as well . JAKE ( Still standing on bed ) She should n't a ' left me ! She 'll regret that . LORRAINE Who wants to be around you , the way you act . Your brother 's run off to God-knows-where , tryin ' to hunt up that dingbat woman a ' yours . ( JAKE gets off the bed fast , moves away from it , charges across stage as though he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where 'd he go ? Where is Frankie ? I knew that would happen ! Soon as I 'm outa the picture . ( LORRAINE goes to bed and starts ripping the sheets and blanket off it , cleaning up the mess . JAKE moves around the space , lost . ) LORRAINE He went back to wherever in the hell she 's from . Montana or somethin ' . Were n't they originally from Montana ? I do n't know . I ca n't keep track of it anymore . JAKE I told him not to go back there ! p. 43 LORRAINE What difference does it make ? JAKE She 's dead ! I told him that already . She 's dead ! LORRAINE Just cool your britches down . JAKE He 's got no business foolin ' around in this thing ! This was strictly between me and her . Where 's my pants ? ( He starts to search for his pants ) LORRAINE You 're not goin ' anywhere . You 're sick . JAKE Where 's my goddamn pants ! He 's sneakin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he gets there . LORRAINE You ca n't go outside in your condition . You would n't last a day . JAKE I need my pants now ! I NEED MY PANTS ! ( JAKE stops suddenly again , gasping for breath . He looks around the space , not seeming to recognize where he is . He stares at the model airplanes . Pause . ) LORRAINE Look at ya . You have n't got any wind to speak of . How 're you gon na go out in the world like that ? JAKE I ca n't stay here . LORRAINE Why not ? You never should a ' left in the first place . This was the first room you ever had to yourself . p. 44 JAKE Where were we before ? LORRAINE You mean , before here ? JAKE Yeah . Before . Where were we before ? LORRAINE You Name-It-U.S.A . Those were the days we chased your daddy from one air base to the next . Always tryin ' to catch up with the next " Secret Mission . " Some secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . Tryin ' to make a big drama outa things . Thought it was romantic I guess . Worst of it was I fell for it . ( JAKE wanders around space , trying to recognize it . ) JAKE What code ? LORRAINE Oh , I ca n't remember them now . There was lots of'em . It was so many years ago . He 'd make ' em all up . JAKE Why 'd he use a code ? LORRAINE He said it was because they did n't want him to reveal his location . JAKE Did you believe him ? LORRAINE Yeah . Why should n't I of ? JAKE Maybe he was lyin ' . LORRAINE Why would he do that ? JAKE So you would n't know what he was up to . That 's why . Why do you think men lie to women ? p. 45 LORRAINE That was back when we were in love . JAKE Oh . LORRAINE That was back before things went to pieces . JAKE ( Still moving around space ) But we finally tracked him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him down . Turned out not to be worth the trip , but we found him all right . JAKE Where ? LORRAINE Different places . You were pretty little then . JAKE Little . LORRAINE Just a spit of a thing . I used to pack you to sleep in a dresser drawer . You were that tiny . JAKE You did n't close the drawer , did ya ? LORRAINE No . ' Course not . ( JAKE stops and stares at her . Pause . ) JAKE Where 's that box ? LORRAINE What ? JAKE That box they put him in . You said you 'd save that box for me . That little leather box . LORRAINE Oh  --  the ashes ? JAKE Yeah . p. 46 LORRAINE Now , how can you remember somethin ' like that and not remember this room ? JAKE Some things stick in your mind . Where 's the box ! LORRAINE It 's here . It 's right under the bed , there . You said save it , so I saved it . JAKE I wan na see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so excited . It 's right under here , unless the mice have gotten to it . I never looked at it again once I stuck it under here . ( She goes to bed , kneels down on floor and reaches under it . She digs around through various items under the bed . ) JAKE How come you kept it under the bed ? LORRAINE Could n't figure out where else to put it . Could n't stand lookin ' at this stuff anymore and I was afraid to throw it away . JAKE How come ? LORRAINE I do n't know . Superstition , I guess . ( She pulls out a dusty American flag , folded in a triangle military-style . She hands it to him . JAKE takes it and stares at it . ) Here 's the flag they gave you at the service . You remember that ? Some government guy in dark glasses said a prayer over him and then he gave you that flag . ( She goes back to searching under the bed for the box as JAKE stares at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 JAKE Dusty . LORRAINE ( As she searches under bed ) Yeah , well , like I said , I have n't touched a thing under here for years . JAKE You coulda dusted it off . LORRAINE Here it is . ( She pulls out a small leather box covered with dust . She blows the dust off the top and wipes it clean with the hem of her dress . She stands and hands the box to JAKE . ) I told ya I 'd save it . ' Case you ever wanted it back someday : JAKE ( Holding box on top of flag ) This is him ? LORRAINE What 's left of him . JAKE ( Feeling weight of box ) He 's kinda heavy . LORRAINE Well , he 's a lot lighter than he was . ( LORRAINE picks the sheets and blanket back up off the floor . ) JAKE Is this all that 's left ? LORRAINE Naw , there 's a box a ' medals and a leather flying jacket under there . More stuff in the garage . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want it . Never did . I only saved it for you . ( JAKE moves to bed and sets the flag and box down on it , then he kneels down beside bed , reaches under and pulls out a cardboard carton full of Air Force medals and a leather flying jacket with small red bombs scratched into one of the sleeves . He sets the carton up on bed , then sits beside it and starts digging through the medals , holding them up to the light . LORRAINE watches him with her arms full of sheets . ) Jake , you can stay here as long as ya want to . I do n't mind , really . I 'm still your mother . You can just live in this room again . Just like you used to . I 'll bring ya stuff . We can have conversations . Tell each other stories . You do n't ever have to go outa this room again if you do n't want to . ( JAKE stares up at the model airplanes , then down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He scratches at the red bombs on the sleeve . Pause. ) p. 48 JAKE How was it he died ? ( Pause . They stare at each other . ) LORRAINE Jake , you remember all that . JAKE No . I do n't remember . I do n't remember it at all . LORRAINE Jake  --  JAKE JUST TELL ME ! ( Pause ) LORRAINE He burned up . JAKE His plane crashed ? LORRAINE No . He was no hero . Got hit by a truck . Drunk as a snake out in the middle of the highway . Truck blew up and he went with it . You already know that . ( JAKE leaps to his feet but stays by the bed . ) JAKE DO N'T TELL ME I ALREADY KNOW SOMETHIN ' I DO N'T KNOW ! DO N'T TELL ME THAT ! HOW COULD I KNOW SOMETHIN ' THAT I DO N'T KNOW ? ( Pause . They stare at each other . ) LORRAINE ( Quietly ) Because you were there , Jake . You were right there with him when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . LORRAINE pulls the sheets up into a tight bundle , close to her . ) You just try and get some rest now , okay ? I got ta go do this laundry . I 'll be right out on the back porch if you need me . You just holler . Best thing you can do now is rest . Do n't think about a thing , Jake . Just rest . Do n't think about nothin ' . ( LORRAINE exits upstage , out of the light , carrying the sheets . JAKE stays in place , staring out across to stage left . Very softly light begins to come up on BETH 's hospital bed , now made up with blue satin sheets . BETH is alone , sitting on the upstage side of the bed with her back to JAKE . She is naked from the waist up with a blue silk dress pulled down around her waist and blue high heels with stockings . She is uninjured now  --  no bandage , her hair soft and beautiful . She is oiling her shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares across at her as the light very slowly rises on her . She continues oiling herself slowly and seductively , unaware of JAKE . She is simply his vision . The light on her is continuously rising but remains very low . Suddenly JAKE makes a move toward her and the light on her blacks out . She disappears . He stops short . Stares into the blackness , then turns and stares at his bed . All the rest of the lights black out except for a tight spotlight on his father 's box of ashes . JAKE crosses back to the box , picks it up , opens it and stares into it for a second . He blows lightly into the box , sending a soft puff of ashes up into the beam of the spotlight . Spotlight fades slowly to black. ) @x Lights up , stage-left set . Living room in BETH 's PARENTS ' house . Same black platform as Act I but now two walls are flown in , stage left and upstage . The upstage wall has a swinging kitchen door mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , with no door , that leads off to an upstairs bedroom . The space visible through open hallway entrance is black and void . Same with space seen through kitchen door when it swings open . A small porch landing with three steps and a handrail is added onto the down-right corner of platform . A window with curtains , dead center of stage-left wall , with black void again seen through window . A well-worn sofa sits under the window , stage left , angled slightly toward audience . A stuffed armchair upstage of sofa , facing audience . An old-fashioned stand-up reading lamp between armchair and sofa . An oval rag rug on floor in front of sofa . A wooden gun rack center of upstage wall . Nothing else . The impression should be very simple and stark yet maintain a sense of realism . If wallpaper is used , it should be subdued and very faded . BETH is sitting on edge of sofa dressed in one of BAYLOR 's faded red plaid shirts , way too big for her . It hangs outside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage now . Short hair . Her bruises almost healed up . MEG approaches her , entering through kitchen door , with a pair of fuzzy slippers in one hand and a pair of heavy work boots in the other . Before lights rise , the sound of a dog defending his territory is heard in the distance off right . Two distant voices of men arguing . The words unintelligible . MEG Here we go , honey . I 've got slippers or boots . Warm , fuzzy slippers . How ' bout these ? They 're very kind to the skin . Like having little lambs wrapped around your toes . p. 51 BETH ( Distracted by outdoor sounds ) No , my feet are fine . I like them fine . Naked . They can move . MEG But the floor 's so cold . This time a ' year the floor 's cold as ice . I used to even put socks on the dogs when they came in . Then your father put a stop to that , of course . BETH ( Standing , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? MEG Outside ? I do n't know , honey . Mike would n't tell me . BETH Mike ? Heez out there ? MEG Yes . He 's been out there all morning talking to that man . BETH ( Moving downstage to porch , looking out ) What man ? MEG Some man . I do n't know . He just showed up . BETH Whatz his voice ? MEG What , honey ? BETH Whatz his voice ? Someone I know . Iz voice I know . MEG I could n't see him from the front door . Mike would n't let him come up to the house . BETH ( Turns fast to MEG ) Who'ze  --  who'ze ? p. 52 MEG Do n't you wan na try these slippers , honey ? They 'd keep you nice and cozy . BETH Tha 's a voice of someone . Before . Someone with a voice before . Someone  --  I know . MEG I 'm not sure who it is . Mike does n't like him , that 's for sure . I just wish he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Moving back toward sofa ) Someone with Jake . Jake 's voice . Iz  --  a man with hiz voice . Same . Heez come to see me ? Haz he come to see me ? ( The sounds outside stop . ) MEG Honey , I ca n't ask Mike . You know how he gets . He gets just like your father . There 's no point in asking . BETH I  --  I  --  can I go ? Can I go out to see ? I want to see . Can I ? MEG No , honey . It 's freezing out there . The ground 's solid ice . BETH He ca n't go . He ca n't . Do n't let him go . I want to see . MEG Honey , it 's nothing but a man . A stranger . Some stranger . ( MIKE enters fast from upstage center space , moves down to stairs and enters from porch . He 's in a heavy jacket , gloves , wool cap , boots with snow on them ; carries shotgun . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stomps his boots and takes his gloves and jacket off . ) Oh , we were just now talking about you , Mike . I thought you were down by the road . p. 53 MIKE Son of a bitch wanted to come right up to the goddamn house . Can you believe that ? Walk right up to the house like a neighbor or somethin ' . I ca n't believe it . Who do these guys think they are , anyway ? MEG Do n't swear in the house , Mike . I 've told you that since you were a little boy . Keep the language outdoors . BETH ( To Mike ) Who'ze he ? Who'ze he ? MIKE Nobody . Just  --  just a guy . I do n't know . BETH Jake ? MIKE ( Turning on BETH ) No ! ! It 's not Jake ! All right ? He 's got nothin ' to do with Jake . Just some guy . When 're you gon na stop thinkin ' about Jake for Christ 's sake ! BETH You lie to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dead . MIKE Oh , so now you 're not dead . Today you 're not dead . Yesterday you were dead but today you 're not . I got ta keep track a ' this . Makes a big difference who you 're talkin ' to  --  a corpse or a live person . MEG Please do n't yell in the house . The walls ca n't take it . BETH I 'm not the one who 's dead . MIKE ( To BETH ) You just settle down , all right ! You just settle down now . I 've about had it with you . I 've been out there all night long in zero cold tryin ' to protect you ! p. 54 BETH You 're not the guard of me ! MIKE Well , who is then ? Who 's gon na protect you ? I 'm the only one left around here . MEG There is no reason to scream . Screaming is not the thing we 're born for . ( Pause ) BETH Haz he gone now ? MIKE Yeah . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To MIKE ) You  --  you . You don ' let me come back . Why don ' you let me come back ? MIKE ( Moves toward her ) Beth  --  BETH ( Stiffens , stands back ) No ! You make  --  you make a war . You make a war . You make an enemy . In me . In me ! An enemy . You . You . You think me . You think you know . You think . You have a big idea . MIKE I 'm just trying to keep you out of trouble . Ca n't you get that in your head ? I 'm tired of going through this with you . BETH You  --  you have a feeling . You have a feeling I 'm you . I 'm not you ! This ! ( Points to her head . ) This did n't happen to you . This ! This . This thought . You do n't know this thought . How ? How can you know this thought ? In me. p. 55 MEG Beth , your brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thinks best . Now do n't get so excited . You 'll only get yourself all worked up again . BETH ( To MEG , softens ) You  --  you a love . You  --  you are only that . Only . You don ' know . Only love . Good . You . Mother . You . Always love . Always . ( To MIKE ) But he lies to me . Like I 'm gone . Not here . Lies and tellz me iz for love . Iz not for love ! Iz pride ! MIKE Okay . Okay , I 'll tell you exactly the truth . I 'll tell you . You wan na know ? It was Jake 's brother . Okay ? That 's who it was . Jake 's little lousy brother . BETH Jake ? MIKE HIS BROTHER ! NOT JAKE ! HIS BROTHER ! MEG Mike ! MIKE ( To MEG ) Well , goddamnit ! She wants to know the truth . She says  --  " tell me the truth , you 're lying to me . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie . I 'm sick and tired of this shit . ( To BETH ) What do you wan na know ?

BETH It was not Jake . p. 56 MIKE It was his brother ! His pathetic little brother . Sniveling up here to our doorstep , asking for forgiveness . BETH Why'z he gone ? MIKE What 'd you expect me to do ? Huh ? Did you want me to invite him in for hot chocolate or something ? Cookies ? Pretend nothing ever happened ? He 's just on a friendly visit ? Sometimes I think you must 've enjoyed getting beat up . Maybe that 's it . Maybe you get some kind of kick out of it . ( Pause ) MEG You do n't need to be cruel , Mike . MIKE This whole thing is cruel . ( Long pause as BETH stares at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) BETH What 's this shirt ? MEG That 's Baylor 's , honey . You wanted that one . That 's the one you picked out of the closet . BETH Smells like him . Baylor . MEG He used to always wear that fishing . That was his favorite shirt . He said you could have it . BETH Smells like fish . MIKE So , now what ? We 're gon na talk about shirts now ? ( To BETH ) What is goin ' on with you ? You shift streams faster than a trout in heat . p. 57 BETH ( Soft , to MIKE ) If something breaks  --  broken . If something broken  --  parts still  --  stay . Parts still float . For a while . Then gone . Maybe never come  --  back . Together . Maybe never . ( Sound of single shot from a deer rifle in distance stage right . ) ( BETH 's head jerks toward sound . ) Zaat ? MIKE Dad . Hunting . MEG He 's been out there all night again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Sometimes I think he 'd rather live out there in that hunting shack year-round . He 's got everything he needs out there . His magazines . His flashlight . His radio . He even eats his meals out there , anymore . I do n't know when all that started . MIKE All what ? MEG Him moving out . When did that start ? MIKE He has n't moved out . He 's hunting . Every year he hunts . You know that . MEG Sometimes I think he 's hiding from us . ( Pause . MIKE goes to armchair , sits , takes his boots off and stretches his legs out  --  continuous as he speaks . ) MIKE Well , there 's only one day left in the season and he has n't got his buck yet . p. 58 MEG I do n't know if I can take another winter of venison . Last year we had venison three times a day . Venison , venison , venison . It still was n't gone by spring . God , how I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MIKE It 's not that bad if you do n't smell it . MEG Funny thing is , I do n't think he likes the meat either . He never eats it . Poor excuse for killing a live thing if you ask me . BETH ( Staring around at space ) This  --  this  --  this is where I used to be ? BETH Where , honey ? MIKE Here ? Inside here . This room ? MEG Yes . This is our home . You recognize it , do n't you ? BETH This room was  --  where we all were  --  together . MEG Yes . That 's right . Christmas , Thanksgiving , Easter . We were always here . MIKE You 're safe here . Long as you stay with us . BETH What 's " safe " ? MIKE Safe . Safe from injury . You wo n't get hurt here . BETH I hurt all over . MEG But it 's getting better , honey . Every day it 's getting a little bit better . p. 59 BETH What is ? MEG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the skin . Is n't that amazing ? It just keeps healing itself . That 's what they told us at the hospital . BETH What brain ? MEG Your brain , honey . BETH Where ? In me . MIKE In your head . The brain in your head . Inside your skull . BETH Iz hiding in there ? MEG No , I woud n't say that exactly . The brain ca n't hide . BETH Iz in there like a turtle ? Like a shell ? MEG Not really . It 's  --  what does a brain look like , Mike ? MIKE It do n't know what it looks like . It 's gray . That 's about all I know about it . MEG Yes . It 's a gray thing . Kind of like a snail , is n't it , Mike ? It 's kind of curled around itself like a big snail . MIKE You got me . BETH Snail . MEG Yes . I think so . I't all lumpy . I saw pictures of it once . They took pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me once . p. 60 BETH We ca n't see it ? MIKE Not when you 're alive . You ca n't see it when you 're alive . BETH Why ? MIKE Because  --  you 'd be dead if you could see it . It 'd be sticking out . BETH You can see the head ? The face . MIKE Yeah . That 's right . But not the brain . The brain 's inside the head . Covered up . BETH Where ? MIKE ( Slaps his forehead ) Inside ! Here ! Inside ! Behind the skull ! ( BAYLOR 's VOICE heard offstage . ) BAYLOR ( Offstage ) Just try to keep your weight off it . That 's it . Do n't put yer weight down on it . Hang on . Just keep ahold of my neck now . ( BAYLOR enters from upstage , then up porch stairs , wearing hunter 's orange from head to toe and a camouflage hunting vest , rifle in one hand . He helps FRANKIE on stage , who is hopping on his right leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a quarter in his left thigh with a little patch of blood  --  nothing more . As they enter , MIKE immediately gets up and grabs his shotgun , sticks the shells back in it and snaps the barrels shut . BAYLOR assists FRANKIE over to the sofa . FRANKIE collapses onto sofa holding his left thigh in pain. ) p. 61 MEG Oh , my goodness , Baylor . What in the world happened here ? We heard you shooting . BAYLOR Aw , this yayhoo was out there in the damn woods without a lick a ' orange on him . Came crashing through that stand of aspen like a freight train and I shot him . MEG You shot him ? Oh , my God , Baylor . BAYLOR Nailed him clean through the thigh . Look at that . Bullet passed right on through and out the other side . Never touched the bone or nothin ' . MEG ( To Frankie ) But it still must hurt . Does n't it hurt ? FRANKIE Yeah . It hurts . MEG It must . BAYLOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shootin ' . I got one day left to bag my limit and this bonehead comes along and scares every damn deer in four counties . FRANKIE I 'm sorry . I was looking for my car . BAYLOR Your car ? Where 'd you park it , in the lake ? MEG Oh , my goodness . BAYLOR Stop staying " Oh , my goodness , Oh my God , " all the time . Think up somethin ' different for a change . MIKE ( Approaching FRANKIE ) You were tryin ' to circle back around , were n't you ? Is n't that what you were doin ' ? Thought you 'd come up around the back side ? I thought I told you to take a hike , buddy . p. 62 FRANKIE ( Staring at BETH ) I just wanted to see her . That 's all . All I wan na do is see her . ( To BETH ) My brother thinks you 're dead , see . I got ta go back and tell him now . BETH Before  --  you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on up to the bedroom now . Go on ! BAYLOR Aw , let her talk to him . Christ . What difference does it make now . He 's not gon na do much harm with that hole in his leg . Mother , help me off with these boots . ( BAYLOR sits heavily in armchair . MEG kneels in front of him and helps pull his boots off . ) MIKE I 'll give him a ride down to the emergency . BETH No  --  he  --  he can stay . I know him . MIKE He 's not stayin ' in this house ! I 'll tell you that right now ! BAYLOR ( To MIKE ) You keep yer voice down , boy ! You forget whose house this is . ( Pause ) No point in movin ' him around right now . Long as the blood 's stopped . Best to prop that leg up and let him set for a while . MEG ( Stands , to FRANKIE ) I 'll get something to put your foot on . p. 63 BAYLOR ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off with this gear now . I 've never seen anybody get so easily distracted as you . Just keep yer mind on yer business now . ( MEG kneels again in front of BAYLOR , finishes with his boots and starts pulling off his orange outer pants , as BAYLOR pulls them down from his waist . Underneath he 's wearing heavy dungarees . ) MEG ( As she helps BAYLOR ) Beth , go get that little footstool out of the kitchen for the man . BETH Kitchen . MEG Yes . In the kitchen , honey . The little footstool . Bring it in here for him . ( BETH exits through kitchen door upstage . ) MIKE ( As he puts his jacket , cap and gloves back on ) I got an idea . Why do n't we just move him on up to the bedroom . Huh ? We got an extra bedroom empty do n't we ? Let 's just move him up there . Then we can serve him breakfast in bed . We can move the TV up there for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric blanket . He could even share the room with Beth , maybe . That 'd be nice and cozy . BAYLOR ( To MIKE ) Hey ! You just cool yourself down , buster. p. 64 MIKE I 'm not stayin ' in the same house with the brother of the man who tried to kill my sister ! I 'm not doin ' that . BAYLOR I 'm the one who shot him ! All right ? Since I 'm the one who shot him , I 'm gon na see to it that he stays alive . I 'm too old to go to jail just yet . Thank you very much . MEG ( Still helping BAYLOR undress ) Ca n't we just talk in a normal tone ? BAYLOR Soon 's it gets normal we 'll talk normal ! MIKE ( Moving toward porch ) You just lemme know . You lemme know when he 's outa here . BAYLOR Where you goin ' ? MIKE Out to the shack . BAYLOR ( To MIKE ) Wait a second . Take the 30-30 . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's only one day left . MEG ( To MIKE ) Just try not to shoot any more people please . ( BAYLOR reaches for deer rifle , across MEG , and hands it to MIKE . MIKE takes it . He stares at FRANKIE . ) MIKE ( To FRANKIE ) You wormed your way in , did n't you ? Pretty cute . But I 'm not forgettin ' anything . Everybody else might forget but I 'm not . Far as I 'm concerned you and your brother are the same person . ( MIKE leans the shotgun against the sofa , then snaps the lever on the 30-30 and engages a bullet . He stares at FRANKIE , then exits out porch and upstage into blackness. ) p. 65 BAYLOR ( To MIKE as he exits ) Do n't mess that shack up . I spent all afternoon sweepin ' the mouse shit out of it . MEG You should n't ought a make him go out in that cold , Baylor . BAYLOR Was n't my idea . It 's his . ( BETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses fast downstage and just stands there , holding it . She stares at audience . Pause . ) Well , take it on over to the man , Beth . Take it over and set it down for him . Do n't just stand there with it . Not gon na do him any good while it 's in the air . MEG ( Stands to help BETH ) Here , honey , I 'll take it . BAYLOR No ! ( Stops MEG ) Let her do it . She can do it . ' Bout time she starts doin ' things by herself . You keep babyin ' her she 's never gon na get any better . ( BETH stays in same place , holding stool . She turns and stares at FRANKIE . MEG kneels and goes back to helping BAYLOR . ) BAYLOR ( Deliberate ) Beth  --  take the stool over to the man and set it down for him . What 're you starin ' at ? ( Pause . BETH moves slowly over to FRANKIE and stops in front of him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66 BAYLOR ( To BETH ) That 's right . Now set it down on the floor . Right in front of him . ( BETH sets the stool down on floor in front of FRANKIE . ) That 's the ticket . Now help him get his leg up on it . FRANKIE That 's all right . I can do it . ( FRANKIE struggles to get his leg up on stool but ca n't do it . ) BAYLOR ( To FRANKIE ) She can help you . Good for her to help somebody else out for a change . Make her realize she 's not the only cripple in this world . MEG Baylor  --  BAYLOR ( To MEG ) What ? She knows all about it . She knows somethin 's gone wrong . MEG I know but you do n't have to  --  BAYLOR What ? Speak the plain truth ? Everybody 's been tiptoeing around here like she ca n't handle the plain truth . And she knows all about it . Do n't ya , Beth ? ( BETH helps FRANKIE get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . BAYLOR ( To MEG ) There now . See that ? Now she 's got the experience of helping somebody else out . And you woulda robbed her a ' that , see . You wan na just keep on lettin ' her believe that she 's never gon na pull outa this thing . p. 67 MEG That 's not true . BAYLOR That 's good , Beth . Now why do n't you go on in the kitchen and make us up a nice big pot a ' black coffee . MEG She ca n't make coffee , Baylor . She 'll burn herself . BAYLOR See , there ya go again . MEG Well , why take the risk of her getting hurt ? She ca n't make coffee . BAYLOR That 's right . " Why take the risk ? " Why take the risk of her getting better ? Why not just let her stay the same ? MEG She is getting better . BAYLOR Nah . We 'll be right back in the same boat we were in with your mother . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the only one left in this joint that can function . MEG Well , you 're never around anyway . BAYLOR I 'm around . I 'm around plenty . But I 'll tell ya one thing  --  I 'm not gon na be the caretaker of a nursing home here . I got better things to do . MEG Like shooting men . BAYLOR That was an accident . MEG Well , I do n't understand how a man can be mistaken for a deer . They do n't look anything alike . p. 68 BAYLOR He was crashin ' through the woods , hell bent for leather . How was I supposed to know ? MEG Did n't you look ? He does n't have antlers or anything . He does n't look anything like a deer . BAYLOR You do n't make an examination before you shoot somethin ' . You just shoot it . FRANKIE It was my fault . BAYLOR Yer darn tootin ' it was your fault . Yer just lucky I 'm as old as I am . In my prime you'da been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have voice I know . ( Pause ) FRANKIE ' Scuse me ? BETH You have voice . BAYLOR ( To FRANKIE ) You understand what 's happened to her , do n't ya ? MEG Baylor , please  --  BAYLOR ( To MEG ) Aw , knock it off . What in the hell are we tryin ' to pull here ? Beth , you go ahead and tell him . Go ahead . Tell the man what happened to you . Go on . ( Pause ) BETH I  --  FRANKIE That 's all right . I just mainly wanted to know if you were alive . My brother 's worried sick about you . He said to tell you he just misses you a lot . ( Pause . Silence MEG stands. ) p. 69 MEG Maybe I 'll make that pot of coffee , Baylor . BAYLOR All right . Why not . And bring me in that tin of Mink Oil for my feet . They 're startin ' to crack again . MEG Do you want to come in and help me , Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) BAYLOR ( To MEG ) Leave her be ! ( MEG exits through door upstage . BETH stands there staring at FRANKIE . BAYLOR stays in armchair . ) BAYLOR ( To FRANKIE ) Christ , there 's got ta be a borderline between polite and stupid . I swear to God . Her mother was the same way . Drive you crazy with politeness . ( Pause . To FRANKIE ) How 's that leg doin ' ? FRANKIE It just burns a little . BAYLOR I 'll bet it does . You took a helluva lick . BETH ( Very simple to FRANKIE ) This  --  this is my father . He 's given up love . Love is dead for him . My mother is dead for him . Things live for him to be killed . Only death counts for him . Nothing else . This  --  This  --  ( She moves slowly toward FRANKIE . ) This is me . This is me now . The way I am . Now . This . All . Different . I  --  I live inside this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . I know you . I know  --  love . I know what love is . I can never forget . That . Never . ( Lights fade . All three stay in place .

Lights up slowly ( cross fade with Scene 1 ending ) , on stage-right bedroom set  --  JAKE 's bed with model airplanes above . Walls in . JAKE is standing extreme downstage on the very edge of the stage , facing audience , stage right of center . He is in his boxer shorts underwear , sleeveless T-shirt under his father 's leather pilot 's jacket . The jacket is covered with all the medals from the cardboard box now . He wears the American flag from his dad 's funeral draped around his neck . He is shaving his face with a cordless electric shaver , staring straight in front of him as though there were a mirror . His face is pale white , eyes sunken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaver . Takes the cap off it and blows the whiskers out then replaces cap and stares in " mirror . " He speaks to himself in a loud whisper as he looks at his face in the imaginary mirror . JAKE ( Whisper ) Do n't think about her feet or her calves or her knees or her thighs or her hips or her waist or her ribs or her tits or her armpits or her shoulders or her neck or her face or her eyes or her hair or her lips . Especially not her lips . Do n't think about any of these things . You 'll be much better off . ( He turns upstage just as SALLY enters through up left door , wearing a jacket , jeans and western boots and carrying a suitcase . They both stop and stare at each other . Pause . SALLY closes the door , then turns back to JAKE . She keeps hold of the suitcase. ) p. 72 SALLY How 're you feelin ' , Jake ? JAKE Me ? ( Pause . He moves fast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crosses , kneels down beside bed , stuffs the flag under bed , pulls out a small black toilet case , unzips it , puts the shaver inside , zips it back up and shoves it back under the bed . He rises to his feet , then sits on the edge of the bed , facing SALLY , and rubs his knee as he stares at her . Pause . ) SALLY ( Sets suitcase on floor ) Where 's Mom ? JAKE ( Rapid speech ) I do n't worry anymore where anybody is . I do n't think about that . Anybody can move wherever they want . I just try to keep track of my own movements these days . That 's enough . Have you ever tried that ? To follow yourself around ? Like a spy . You can wind up anywhere . It 's amazing . Like , just now I caught myself shaving . I was right over there . Shaving my face . I did n't know I was doing that until just now . It 's kinda scary , ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a possibility that you could do something that you did n't even know about . You could be somewhere that you could n't even remember being . Has that ever happened to you ? p. 73 SALLY No . No , it 's the opposite with me . Everything just keeps repeating itself . JAKE Oh . Well , then you do n't know what I 'm talkin ' about . ( Pause . She stares at him . He grabs his knees and stares at the floor . ) SALLY Um  --  I decided to come back and see if I could maybe help you out , Jake . You do n't mind , do ya ? JAKE Me ? Help me out ? ( He gets off the bed fast , as though he 's just remembered something important . He kneels down on floor again , pulls toilet case out , unzips it , digs around in case and pulls out a toenail clipper . He zips case back up and shoves it under bed . Then he sits on edge of bed , facing SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there watching him , stuffs her hands in her pockets . ) SALLY I was out there  --  I was driving around in the car out there and  --  JAKE Where were you headed ? SALLY I was just  --  I was driving around the house . In circles . Real slow . I could n't make up my mind . JAKE No , I mean where were you headed originally ? Before you decided to come back ? p. 74 SALLY I was n't sure . I mean  --  I was thinkin '  --  at first I was thinkin ' I 'd go up and try to see Beth , and then  --  ( JAKE stands suddenly . Starts moving around the room . SALLY just stands there . ) JAKE Beth ? You were gon na ' go and try to see Beth ? Nobody believes me ! SALLY Now wait a second  --  JAKE NOBODY BELIEVES ME ! Bunch a ' traitors for family . Did you talk to Frankie about her before you left ? SALLY No ! Why would I talk to Frankie ? JAKE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go see her unless you 'd talked to Frankie first . Why would you think to go see her ? She 's dead ! Did n't I tell ya that already ? SALLY Yeah . But I thought I 'd go see her anyway . JAKE A dead person ? You wanted to go see a dead person ? SALLY There was other times when you said you 'd killed her  --  when you thought you 'd killed her  --  remember ? ( JAKE stops , stares at her . Pause . ) JAKE So what 'd you come back here for ? SALLY I do n't know exactly . I started thinkin ' about this whole thing . This family . How everything 's kinda  --  shattered now . p. 75 JAKE Now ? What d' ya mean " now " ? When was n't it shattered ? SALLY I do n't wan na start fightin ' with you just when I walk in the door . I did n't come back for that . JAKE ( Crossing back to bed ) Why not ? What else are we gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas ? You got some brave ideas about mending things up . Is that it ? I 'll tell ya the only idea that 's gon na work . I been sittin ' here in this room for days thinkin ' about it and I finally came up with it . SALLY What 's that . JAKE ( Sits on bed , quieter ) I 'm not goin ' outdoors anymore . I 'm not leavin ' this room . Mom brings me food . I do n't need the outside . All I do is get in trouble out there . SALLY Well , you ca n't just stay locked up in here , Jake . That 's crazy . JAKE No . Out there is crazy . Out there . Soon 's you step out that door . ( JAKE goes back to clipping his toenails again . He ignores her . Pause . SALLY watches him . Pause . ) SALLY ( Turning toward her suitcase ) All right . I guess I was wrong . I thought there might be a chance I could talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I guess I was dead wrong . p. 76 JAKE Wait a second , Sally . Come on . SALLY Naw , you make it impossible . You 're gon na sit around here pretending to be crazy . Tryin ' to make everyone believe you 're crazy . Is that what you 're gon na do ? Well , it 's not gon na change what you did . You already got away with that once , did n't you ? JAKE Sally  --  SALLY Do n't worry . I 'm not gon na give you away . JAKE We made a promise . SALLY Yeah . JAKE Do n't forget . ( Pause ) SALLY I wo n't . JAKE Look , I need an ally . Just one . Just one good , solid ally that I can rely on . Everyone else is against me . SALLY No ! I 'm not doin ' that again for you . Never again . JAKE ( Suddenly in a whisper ) Frankie called here . He called here . I heard Mom talkin ' to him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sets suitcase down . ) SALLY So what if Frankie called ? Why should n't he call ? He 's your brother . JAKE ( Whisper ) He did n't ask to talk to me ! p. 77 SALLY Why are you whispering now ? What 's gotten into you ? JAKE ( Whisper ) Mom . SALLY What about her ? JAKE ( Whisper ) She 's with him . Her and Frankie are together . They 've got a pact . SALLY What 're you talkin ' about ? JAKE ( Whisper ) They 're tryin ' to make me believe that Beth 's alive . SALLY She probably is . JAKE Are you with them too ? SALLY I 'm not with anybody , all right ! I 'm all by myself . JAKE Then you can help me . There 's no reason why you could n't help me . SALLY Look , I went through this once with you , Jake . With Dad . I already went through this . JAKE ( Moving to her , pleading , in a whisper ) No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They wan na make me suffer . Do n't you know that ? Frankie thinks I deserve to suffer . So does Mom . SALLY Nobody wants to make you suffer . It 's just you . JAKE ( Whisper ) It 's that whole family too . Beth 's family . You remember how they hated me. p. 78 SALLY Will you please stop whispering ! It 's makin ' me nuts ! ( Pause . JAKE stops and stares at her . ) JAKE ( Normal voice now ) You 're afraid a ' me , are n't ya ? ( Pause ) Are n't ya ! SALLY I 'm not afraid of you . JAKE Yeah , you are . SALLY Only because you remind me of Dad sometimes . JAKE Dad ? ( Pause ) Dad ? SALLY Yeah . You do . Sometimes you sound just like him . JAKE I do n't sound anything like him . I never sounded like him . I 've made a point not to . SALLY You do . The way you get that creepy thing in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creepy thing like you 're gon na turn into an animal or something . JAKE What animal ? SALLY I do n't know what animal ! JAKE What kind of animal ? SALLY Not any special kind . Just an animal sound in general . ( Pause . They stare at each other. ) p. 79 JAKE A bear ? SALLY Do n't get cute . JAKE You remember how he used to try to dance with you when he was drunk ? How he 'd pull you right up tight against his chest and breathe into your neck . You remember all that ? SALLY What 're you tryin ' to do ? JAKE He 'd put on Lefty Frizell and twirl you around the kitchen until you got so dizzy you had to run into the bathroom and puke . I remember lyin ' awake listening to you with the dry heaves and listening to him bellowing down the hallway at Mom . Warning her not to go in and help you out . I remember all that ! SALLY Yeah ! Then you remember the night he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stare at each other . Pause . ) JAKE No ! ( Pause ) That 's the part I forgot . ( LORRAINE enters quickly with a metal serving tray and wearing an apron . She stops when she sees SALLY . Pause . ) LORRAINE ( To SALLY ) Oh . I thought you might 've come back . I saw that car out there and I said to myself : " I bet she 's back . " SALLY That 's pretty sharp , Mom . p. 80 LORRAINE Just puttin ' two and two together . ( Crosses to bed and starts putting the dirty breakfast dishes on tray . ) What'sa matter , you get homesick or somethin ' ? Do n't tell me you got homesick for yer little ole family . Out there all alone on the big bad American road . SALLY Not exactly . No . LORRAINE Well , what was it then ? You forget somethin ' ? JAKE ( To LORRAINE ) Were you listening to us out there ?

That 's what you told me , is n't it ? JAKE I did n't tell you that so you could tell her ! That was private . LORRAINE So there is a secret . SALLY ( To LORRAINE ) He thinks you 've got some kind of a plot going to make him suffer . JAKE Sally , you shut up ! LORRAINE Suffer ? JAKE I did n't say anything like that . ( JAKE stops .

LORRAINE watches them but continues to slowly collect the breakfast plates off the bed . ) LORRAINE Well  --  looks like you 're just gon na have to stay away for a spell , Sally . We ca n't have him gettin ' upset like this . Not in his condition . He was n't like this until you showed up . SALLY ( Still with her eyes on JAKE ) I 'm not leavin ' . I 'm sick to death of leavin ' . Every time I pack , I tremble now . I start to tremble . It 's in my body . My whole body shakes from the memory of all this leavin ' . It feels like a leaving that will last forever . This is my home as much as his . p. 82 LORRAINE But we 're in a state of emergency here now , with your brother like this . This is a crisis . You have to be a little flexible in a crisis . SALLY I 'm not leavin ' ! LORRAINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAKE ( To LORRAINE , moving away from SALLY ) She can stay if she wants to .

We were self-sufficient , were n't we , Jake ? What do we need her for ? JAKE I can trust her . ( Pause ) LORRAINE ( Laughs ) I have been doin ' my best to pull you out of this thing . I went outa my way to bring you back here . I fixed up your room , just like it used to be . I 've been cookin ' all your meals . JAKE It 's just a trap . LORRAINE For what ? Why would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so twisted up that you ca n't even recognize your own mother 's good intentions ? JAKE ( About SALLY ) I recognize her . I remember her real good . We went through somethin ' together . ( JAKE fixes on SALLY as he speaks about her . SALLY 's back is toward stage left . Very slowly , as this scene continues , light begins to rise on the stage-left set . A soft pool of light on the sofa where FRANKIE lies on his back with his head Upstage . BETH is kneeling on the floor next to FRANKIE , wrapping the shirt she wore in the first scene around FRANKIE 's wounded leg . Her gestures are very soft and loving . She wears jeans and a bra . FRANKIE is sweating hard and his face is extremely pale , like JAKE 's now . JAKE slowly approaches SALLY as he speaks to her . SALLY , LORRAINE and JAKE pay no attention to the stage-left light. ) p. 85 LORRAINE Well , so did we , Jake . I 've known you a lot longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that , Sally ? Where was that ? Where were we when that happened ? SALLY You do n't wan na know . JAKE We drove all night long . SALLY Just forget about it now . ( SALLY moves away from JAKE , crosses to bed and sits on it . JAKE stays where he is , facing stage left . Now he begins to see BETH and FRANKIE in the dim light but he regards them as a distant vision in his mind . LORRAINE and SALLY ignore the stage-left action . JAKE remains fixed on BETH and FRANKIE . ) JAKE ( Staring at BETH and FRANKIE ) We listened to the radio . ( LORRAINE crosses to SALLY carrying the tray of dirty plates . ) LORRAINE ( To SALLY ) See the state you 've got him in now . See what you 've done . SALLY ( Sitting on bed ) I have n't done a thing but come back home . ( SALLY reaches under the bed and pulls out the flag . She spreads it across her lap. ) p. 86 LORRAINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You knew this was gon na happen . He was doin ' so well with me lookin ' after him . He was gon na stay . He was just gon na live here like he used to . Now you 've got his mind all driftin' ' away again . JAKE ( Still fixed on BETH and FRANKIE ) We drove a thousand miles and never said a word . LORRAINE ( After pause , to SALLY ) Well , you stay then . You suit yourself . I 'll just wait you out . I can wait a whole lot longer than you can . Believe you me . I 've been a lifetime at it . He 'll come back around to me . You wait and see . He 'll come back . ( LORRAINE exits upstage with tray and plates . JAKE stays fixed on BETH and FRANKIE . SALLY stares at JAKE 's back . Pause . ) JAKE ( With his back to SALLY ) You got ta help me escape , Sally . I got ta get back there . She 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down under bed and pulls out the leather box of ashes . She holds it in her lap and opens it as JAKE remains staring stage left . ) SALLY What 's this ? ( JAKE slowly turns around facing SALLY . They stare at each other as lights fade on them to black . Lights are rising on BETH and FRANKIE simultaneously. ) p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 Lights remain up on stage-left set with FRANKIE on his back stretched out on sofa , head upstage , and BETH on her knees beside him , wrapping BAYLOR 'S shirt around his injured leg . FRANKIE Uh  --  look  --  Beth  --  do n't you think you ought a put your shirt back on ? BETH You need it . FRANKIE I do n't . Really . I do n't . It 's stopped bleeding . It has n't bled for a long time now . BETH It could start again . FRANKIE It just aches a little . It 's not bleeding anymore . BETH It 's going up your leg now . FRANKIE ( Sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's bad . FRANKIE What 's that mean ? A black line . ( FRANKIE pulls his pant leg up . Looks at his leg . ) BETH It 's bad . Poison . FRANKIE ( Pushing his pant leg down again ) Look  --  please , just leave it alone and put your shirt back on . Your dad might come back in here . ' p. 88 BETH He 's asleep . FRANKIE Well , then your mother or your brother could come . Somebody could come in here . BETH Does n't matter . FRANKIE It does matter ! I 'm on thin ground as it is without them seeing you on your knees with your shirt off . What 're they gon na think if they walk in here and find you rubbing my leg with no shirt on ? Please stop rubbing my leg now ! BETH Do n't you like it ? FRANKIE Just stand up . Stand up on your feet and put your shirt back on . Please , Beth . Just act like we 're having a conversation or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're afraid of you . FRANKIE How do you figure that ? BETH They tell it in their voice . FRANKIE They want to kill me . BETH Only Mike . But he wo n't . FRANKIE What makes you so sure about that ? BETH ( Quick ) Because only half of him believes you 're what he hates . The other half knows it 's not true . ( Pause . FRANKIE stares at her. ) p. 89 FRANKIE I thought you could n't uh  --  BETH What ? FRANKIE ( Lies back down ) I do n't know . I thought you could n't talk right or something . You sound okay to me . BETH I do ? FRANKIE Yeah . Your dad said there was  --  I mean you were having some kind of trouble . BETH Oh . There was that time . I do n't know . I get them mixed . I get the thought . Mixed . It dangles . Sometimes the thought just hangs with no words there . FRANKIE But you can speak all right ? BETH It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes . Again . I do n't know why . You hear me ? Now ? FRANKIE Yes . You sound all right . I mean it sounds like you 're doing pretty good . BETH Sounds like it . FRANKIE Yeah . BETH You can speak ? Speech . FRANKIE Me , Yeah , sure . BETH But you ca n't walk . FRANKIE No . Not right now . BETH I would rather walk than talk . p. 90 FRANKIE Yeah  --  do you  --  would you mind getting up off the floor , please , and putting your shirt back on ? BETH Maybe they 'll have to cut your leg off . FRANKIE ( Sits up fast again ) What ? Who do you mean ? BETH Maybe cut . Like me . Cut me . Cut you out . Like me . See ? ( She bends her head forward and pulls the hair up on the back of her neck to show FRANKIE a nonexistent scar . FRANKIE looks at the place on her head that she 's showing him . ) BETH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knife tracks . FRANKIE ( Looking at her head ) What ? There 's nothing there . There 's no scar there . BETH ( Straightens her head again ) No brain . Cut me out . Cut . Brain . Cut . FRANKIE No , Beth , look  --  they did n't  --  they did n't operate did they ? Nobody said anything about that . BETH They do n't say . Secret . Like my old Mom . Old . My Grand Mom . Old . They cut her . Out . Disappeared . They do n't say her name now . She 's gone . Vanish . ( She makes a " whooshing " sound like wind . ) My Father sent her someplace . Had her gone . p. 91 FRANKIE They would n't just go in there and operate without your consent . They ca n't do that . It 's a law . They need written consent or something . Somebody has to sign something . BETH Mike . FRANKIE What ? BETH Mike did . FRANKIE No , Beth . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something like that . BETH He wants me out . FRANKIE He 's your brother . He loves you . BETH ( Stands , moves away from FRANKIE ) You do n't know him ! FRANKIE Well , there 's no scar there , Beth . ( Unwraps the shirt from his leg and offers it out to her . ) Here , take this shirt back . Please . Come and take it . ( Pause . Slowly BETH bends down and takes shirt . She stands with it and holds it out away from herself . She giggles to herself . ) BETH ( Holding shirt out ) Look how big a man is . So big . He scares himself . His shirt scares him . He puts his scary shirt on so it wo n't scare himself . He ca n't see it when it 's on him . Now he thinks it 's him . ( She giggles and puts the shirt back on . Buttons it up . FRANKIE watches her , still sitting on sofa . ) Jake was scared of shirts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only scared of people . ( BETH starts moving in circles , pulling the front of the shirt out away from herself and looking at the buttons and fabric . ) BETH ( Referring to shirt ) This is like a custom . Big . Too big . Like a custom . FRANKIE A what ? BETH Custom . Like a custom . FRANKIE A custom ? BETH For play . Acting . FRANKIE Oh . You mean a " costume " ? BETH Costume . FRANKIE Yeah . A " costume . " I get what you mean . BETH Pretend . FRANKIE You were in a play , right ? I mean you were acting . BETH ( Moving , playing with shirt ) Pretend is more better . FRANKIE What do you mean ? BETH Pretend . Because it fills me . Pretending fills . Not empty . Other . Ordinary . Is no good . Empty . Ordinary is empty . Now , I 'm like the man . ( Pumps her chest up , closes her fists , sticks her chin out and struts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings me a man . I am a shirt man . Can you see ? Like father . You see me ? Like brother . ( She laughs. ) p. 93 FRANKIE Yeah . You liked acting , huh ? ( BETH keeps moving , finding variations off the shirt to play with . FRANKIE sits on sofa watching her . ) BETH Pretend to be . Like you . Between us we can make a life . You could be the woman . You be . FRANKIE What was the play you were in ? Do you remember ? BETH ( Moving toward FRANKIE ) You could pretend to be in love with me . With my shirt . You love my shirt . This shirt is a man to you . You are my beautiful woman . You lie down . ( BETH moves in to FRANKIE and tries to push him down on the sofa by the shoulders . FRANKIE resists . ) FRANKIE Now , wait a second , Beth . Wait , wait . Come on . ( BETH keeps trying to push FRANKIE back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giggling , pushing FRANKIE ) You fight but all the time you want my smell . You want my shirt in your mouth . You dream of it . Always . You want me on your face . ( FRANKIE pushes her away hard , then sits on edge of sofa . BETH stands away from him . ) FRANKIE ( Pushing her away ) Now cut it out ! ( Pause as BETH stares at him from a distance . ) Now , look  --  I ca n't hang around here . I did n't come here to fool around . I 've got ta get back home and talk to Jake about this . That 's the whole reason I came here . He 's gon na think something went wrong . p. 94 BETH Jake . FRANKIE Yeah , He 's gon na think somethin ' happened to me . BETH Your other one . You have his same voice . Maybe you could be him . Pretend . Maybe . Just him . Just like him . But soft . With me . Gentle . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANKIE stands awkwardly , supporting himself by the sofa , on his bad leg . ) FRANKIE I need to find some transportation outa here ! I need to find my car ! I ca n't hang around here , Beth . BETH ( Moving toward FRANKIE ) You could be better . Better man . Maybe . Without hate . You could be my sweet man . You could . Pretend to be Try . My sweetest man . ( As BETH gets closer , FRANKIE starts to move around the sofa , hopping on his bad leg and trying to keep the sofa between him and BETH . ) FRANKIE ( Hopping away from her ) No , Beth . This is not something I want to do right now . It 's not good for my leg . I should be resting it . I have to be getting out of here now . BETH ( Moving after him slowly ) You could pretend so much that you start thinking this is me . You could really fall in love with me . How would that be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're Jake 's wife . We 've got no business messing around like this ! Now it 's time for me to go . I have to go now . I have to find my car . BETH It 's buried . FRANKIE What ? BETH There 's a blizzard . It 's buried . We have to stay together now . Us . That 's funny how we wind up . ( Laughs . ) FRANKIE A blizzard ? What 're you talking about , a blizzard . How long was I asleep ? BETH ( Moving toward porch , pointing out ) See ? Look . Out there . Every-thing 's white . FRANKIE ( Trying to move away from sofa , toward porch ) When did that happen ? BETH We have to stay alone . Together . Here . Us . ( FRANKIE takes a couple of hopping steps and falls to the floor . BETH moves to him . ) FRANKIE ( On floor ) Goddamnit ! ( FRANKIE clutches his leg in pain . BETH kneels beside him and starts to take her shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabs her wrists . ) No ! Look  --  do n't take your shirt off again ! Do n't do it . The shirt is not gon na do my leg any good . It 's useless . Understand ? The shirt is no help . So just leave it on . Okay ? Just leave the shirt on , Beth . ( He lets go of her wrists . She stops trying to take the shirt off. ) p. 96 BETH Maybe they 'll cut . Cut . FRANKIE Stop saying that ! I do n't like the sound of it . It 's not as bad as all that . Amputation is not the answer here . Is there any way you could make a phone call for me ? ( BETH stands , moves to sofa and sits . She watches FRANKIE on the floor . ) BETH ( Sitting on sofa ) You can only think of far away ? Only thoughts of where you came from ? Nothing here ? Nothing right here ? Now . FRANKIE I 'm in a situation here that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't expect to be stuck here . BETH Stuck . Like me . Stuck . FRANKIE This is your home . You live here . I do n't . BETH But you have brain . FRANKIE What ? BETH Brain . In you . Thinking . FRANKIE So do you ! BETH No . Mike took it . My father told him to . ( She gets up from sofa and crosses past FRANKIE to porch . She looks out . FRANKIE on floor behind her . ) FRANKIE Beth , that 's just not true . That 's not true . I do n't know where you got that idea from . You 'd be dead if you did n't have a brain . You ca n't live without one . p. 97 BETH ( Looking out over porch ) Then why is this so empty ? So empty now . Everything . Gone . A hole . ( Sounds of MIKE breathing heavily offstage . ) FRANKIE What 's that ? Beth ? What 's that sound ? Is someone out there ? Beth . ( BETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on the couch now . There 's somebody coming . ( MIKE enters from the porch , covered in snow and carrying the severed hindquarters of a large buck with the hide still on it . He carries the butchered deer over his right shoulder with his rifle in his left hand . MIKE sees FRANKIE on the floor . He stops . Pause . He stares at BETH , then back to FRANKIE . MIKE flops the hindquarters down on the floor in the middle of the room , then props his rifle on top of the meat . He pulls his gloves off and starts warming his hands by blowing into them . FRANKIE stares at MIKE from the floor . BETH stares at the deer parts . Pause . ) MIKE ( To BETH , but staring at FRANKIE ) Tell Dad I kept the rack for myself . It 's a trophy buck . He can have the meat but I 'm keepin ' the rack . BETH ( Still staring at deer ) He does n't eat the meat . Momma says he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed it to the dog . I do n't care what he does with it . ( Pause . To FRANKIE ) What 're you doin ' on the floor ? FRANKIE I ca n't get up . MIKE ( To BETH ) He did n't try nothin ' , did he ? ( Pause . BETH keeps staring at the deer . ) Beth ! BETH Huh ? MIKE He did n't try to pull anything on ya , did he ? FRANKIE I fell . MIKE ( To FRANKIE ) I 'm askin ' her ! BETH ( Staring at deer ) You cut him in half ? MIKE Beth , I 'm askin ' you a question ! ( MEG enters from up left in nightgown and bathrobe , slippers . She just appears , drowsy from sleep . ) MEG Why is there so much noise now ? Your father 's trying to get some sleep . MIKE He should try sleepin ' at night like everybody else . FRANKIE ( To MEG ) Mam  --  MEG ( To FRANKIE ) Why are n't you up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cold on the floor like that . p. 99 BETH Mama ? Daddy does n't eat the meat , does he ? ( MEG looks at BETH , then she sees the deer carcass on the floor . She approaches it slowly , stepping over FRANKIE . ) Mike said to give it to Daddy but he does n't eat the meat . MEG ( Staring at deer quarters ) Mike  --  what in the world ? Ca n't you take it down to the freezer ? MIKE Tell Dad to do it when he gets up . I shot it for him , he can dress it out . I 'm goin ' back out there . There 's deer all over the place . MEG Well , you ca n't just leave it here in the middle of the living room floor . MIKE Why not ? It 's frozen solid . Wo n't thaw out for hours yet . I thought I 'd surprise him . MEG He 'll be surprised all right . FRANKIE ( Still on floor , trying to crawl to sofa ) Mam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for me ? MEG I suppose so . Is it long distance ? MIKE Nobody 's makin ' any phone calls for you , buddy . The lines are frozen solid . You 're stuck . You 're stuck right here . It 's snowin ' like there 's no tomorrow out there . p. 100 MEG ( Moving toward porch , looking out ) Is it that bad ? I must 've dozed off . It was n't snowing that hard when I went upstairs . FRANKIE ( Reaching sofa , trying to pull himself up ) I have to get back home ! I ca n't stay here anymore ! I have to get back home ! MEG ( Staring out over porch at snow ) Please , do n't scream in the house . This house is very old . FRANKIE ( Clawing his way up onto sofa , to MIKE ) Look  --  look  --  you want me outa here , right ? Everybody wants me outa here ? I do n't belong here , right ? I 'm not part of your family . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I am willing to go . Now . I 'm ready . I 'm ready to go now ! Just get me outa here whatever way you can . I 'll do whatever 's necessary . I 'll pay you . Just get me outa here ! ( MIKE smiles and stares at FRANKIE , puts his gloves back on , picks up his rifle . BETH crosses slowly over to FRANKIE . FRANKIE collapses , exhausted , on sofa . ) BETH ( Beside FRANKIE now , she pats him softly on his head ) Your whole life can turn around . Upside down . In a flash . Sudden . Do n't worry . Do n't worry now . This whole world can disappear . Everything you know can go . You wo n't even recognize your own hands . ( BETH , as she exits , moves slowly upstage and exits through hallway entrance . ) Night , Mama . p. 101 MEG Good night , dear . MIKE ( To MEG ) It 's not night ! It 's daytime ! Jesus Christ , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns slowly and stares out over porch . MIKE exits out porch , down stairs and disappears upstage with his rifle . MEG stays looking out over porch . ) FRANKIE ( Yelling to MIKE as he exits ) Wait a second ! ( Pause . FRANKIE : and MEG are left alone , MEG , with her back to FRANKIE , staring out at snow . FRANKIE stares at her back . ) MEG ( Keeping her back to FRANKIE , staring out ) I never get tired of seeing snow . Is n't that funny ? ( Lights fade to black. ) p. 102 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 Lights up on stage-right set . Night . Moon is full . SALLY is in JAKE 's bed with the blanket pulled up around her neck , lying on her back . JAKE is standing in the middle of the room in his underwear still , leather jacket with medals . He 's draping the flag around his neck and over his shoulders , holding the leather box of ashes in one hand . SALLY This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed ) Just tuck yourself in . Tuck the blanket tight around you so she sees there 's a body in there . ( He goes to SALLY and starts tucking the blanket tightly around her with her arms inside and only her head sticking out . ) SALLY But my body does n't look anything like your body . JAKE Does n't matter . She 's not gon na look that close . Turn over on your stomach so she does n't see your face . SALLY She 'll see my hair then . JAKE Put your head under the pillow . Turn over and put your head under the pillow . Come on , Sally . You got ta do it . ( SALLY turns herself over on her stomach as JAKE keeps tucking the blanket around her tightly. ) p. 103 SALLY This is really stupid , Jake . Where 'd you see this , in some old prison movie ? JAKE ( Tucking blanket around her , then putting pillow over her head ) Now when she comes in , in the morning  --  she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 'll say somethin ' like : " Rise and shine  --  it 's coffee time ! " You just stay under the pillow . You can kinda moan or somethin '  --  make a few little movements , but do n't say anything to her . ( SALLY takes the pillow off her head and throws it on floor . ) SALLY ( Throwing pillow ) I ca n't breathe under here ! I feel like a mummy . ( JAKE picks up pillow . ) JAKE Sally , you got ta cover your head or she 'll know right away . SALLY All right , just hand me the pillow . When I hear her comin ' , I 'll put it over my head . JAKE What if you fall asleep ? You could fall asleep and forget . SALLY I wo n't forget . Just hand me the pillow . ( Pause . JAKE tosses the pillow on her head . SALLY takes it and moves it to one side . Pause . ) You better go through the bathroom window . She 'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAKE I know how to escape . Do n't worry . SALLY Are n't you gon na wear any pants ? JAKE She hid ' em . She thinks that 's gon na stop me .

JAKE I 'll make it all right . There 's nothin ' gon na stop me . Not Frankie or Mom or that family of hers or  --  ( He stop 's himself . Stares into space . ) SALLY What'sa matter , Jake ? JAKE ( Staring ) There 's this thing  --  this thing in my head . ( SALLY rises up slowly on one elbow in the bed and stares at him . He whispers now . ) ( Whisper ) This thing that the next moment  --  the moment right after this one will  --  blow up . Explode with a voice . A scream from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew once but now it 's changed . It does n't know me either . Now . It used to but not now . I 've scared it into something else . Another form . A whole other person who does n't see me anymore . Who does n't even remember that we knew each other once . I 've got ta see her again , Sally . ( Suddenly BETH screams from out of the darkness , stage left. ) p. 105 BETH ( In dark ) JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE ! ( Lights black out stage right. ) @x Stage-right set . LORRAINE is in JAKE 's bed bundled up in blankets to her neck . She shakes all over with the cold chills and her face is pale and sweating . The model airplanes still hang overhead . SALLY sits in the chair , stage left of the bed , with a bowl of soup on her lap and a spoon in her hand . A cup of coffee sits steaming on the side table . SALLY 's voice is heard first in darkness . SALLY ( In dark ) Rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep up fast to bright morning . SALLY offers LORRAINE a spoonful of soup . ) LORRAINE Did he tell you to say that ? He probably did , did n't he ? Where is the humiliation supposed to end ? SALLY Just try a little sip of soup , Mom . Just a little sip . LORRAINE Not from you . SALLY Look , you ca n't keep blaming me forever . He 's gone . There was nothin ' I could do about it . LORRAINE Is there any good reason in this Christless world why men leave women ? Is there ? Is there any good reason for that ? You tell me . You tell me . Is n't there enough to suffer already ? We got all kinda good reasons to suffer without men cookin ' up more . p. 107 SALLY There 's always a chance he might come back . LORRAINE He wo n't come back now . Thanks to you . Not now . I know him . He 's like a stray dog . He 's home for a while and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he 's gone again . I know where he 's gone too . Straight to that girl . You can bet yer bivey on that . She 's got a hold on his mind . SALLY Well , Frankie 'll bring him back then . He 'll find him . LORRAINE Frankie ca n't even find his own zipper . How 's he gon na find his brother ? SALLY Just try a little soup , Mom . LORRAINE I do n't want any a ' that slop ! Stop tryin ' to pawn it off on me . SALLY It 's the same batch you made for Jake . LORRAINE I know . Smells like it . SALLY ( Smelling soup ) Smells all right to me LORRAINE It 's ripe . SALLY Well , you got ta eat somethin ' . LORRAINE My son 's abandoned me ! Ca n't you understand that ? He 's abandoned me . And you put him up to it . SALLY I did n't put him up to nothin ' . What was he gon na do ? Stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later . p. 108 LORRAINE He 's run off to the wild world when he could 've stayed here under my protection . He could 've stayed here forever and no one could 've touched him . Now he 's gon na wind up right back in prison . In prison , where they 'll eat him alive . SALLY ( Offering spoon to LORRAINE ) Just take a little bit on your tongue . See if you like it . ( LORRAINE sits up fast and knocks the spoon out of SALLY 's hand . SALLY stands and moves left , away from LORRAINE . ) LORRAINE ( As she knocks spoon away ) Get that stuff away from me ! What'sa matter with you ! I 'm not interested in food . I 'm not interested in keeping something alive that 's already dead . SALLY You 're not dead yet ! You wo n't get out of it that easy ! ( Pause ) LORRAINE I know what 's gon na happen . I can see it plain as day . They 'll find him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Busted open like a road dog . Then maybe you 'll be satisfied . SALLY I do n't want anything to happen to him any more than you do . He could n't stay here . LORRAINE I 'll get a call . Cop will come to my door . Just like before . Just like with his daddy . I 'll wait for that cop . I 'll wait right here . Long as I have to . p. 109 SALLY Now do n't start imagining things . LORRAINE There 's nothin ' imaginary about it . I can see it . SALLY What can you see ? LORRAINE Maybe the same cop will come . The very same cop . I never could figure that out . Why they 'd send a cop ? Why should a cop be a messenger of death ? It 's like sending a fireman . ( LORRAINE lies back down in bed again . She pulls the blankets up around her neck . Pause . ) SALLY You ca n't let yourself get so worked up over this . You 're gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't you ? Back then . Jake never woulda done somethin ' like that . He'da come and told me face to face . SALLY We were miles away . Mexico . It happened in Mexico . Remember ? LORRAINE I remember ! Do n't talk to me like I 'm an idiot . SALLY We tried to call you that night it happened . We both tried to call you but they said the police had to do it . It was international . I never wanted to send a cop . They said it had to be official . LORRAINE Does n't matter . Official , unofficial , it 's the same news . Dead is dead . Nobody can make it un-dead . ( Pause ) p. 110 SALLY You did n't really care one way or the other , did you ? You 'd let him go a long time ago . LORRAINE He left me ! All right ? Get that straight in your noggin . He left me ! Not the other way around . SALLY You never tried to find him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man runs off . Into the night . No word . No note . No phone call . Disappears like an apparition and I 'm supposed to go track his ass down . Not me , sister . No sir . Not this one . Let him stagger around , lost and wild-eyed if he wants to . Let him bang his head up and down the alleyways moanin ' like a baby about some mystery he does n't even have a clue to . You ca n't save the doomed ! You make a stab at it . You make the slightest little try and you 're doomed yourself . Take a look at your brother if you do n't believe me . SALLY But you never even tried , did you ? LORRAINE Tried what ? Who are you to be judgin ' me now ? Who are you ? You do n't even have a man . Never did . SALLY You 're not recommending it , are you ? LORRAINE Just do n't go accusing me of neglecting your father . You do n't know nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . p. 111 LORRAINE About what ? SALLY Our trip down there . Me and Jake made a special trip . Remember ? We found him in his trailer down there . LORRAINE ( Lies back down ) So what ? Ya want a medal or somethin ' ? You 're his kids , not his wife . Why should n't you try to find him . I do n't wan na hear about that stuff now . SALLY We really surprised him . I do n't think he 'd had a visitor for months . LORRAINE Who 'd visit him ? SALLY He did n't even know who we were at first . Just stood there at the screen door , kinda staring at us like we might be burglars or something . LORRAINE Probably drunk . As usual . SALLY Nope . Stone cold sober . Did n't have any money to drink . He looked real weak and vulnerable . The opposite of how he was when he was drinking . LORRAINE He was always weak . That never changed . SALLY He took us inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smelled like dirty laundry and cigarettes and something else . Something almost sweet . LORRAINE Booze . SALLY Maybe . p. 112 LORRAINE Tiger Rose . That was his baby . Tiger Rose . I musta tripped over a million a ' them skinny green bottles . SALLY He had all these pictures of us taped to the walls . Baby pictures and 4-H Club pictures and pictures of Jake running with a football . But they were all squeezed in between these other pictures . Pictures of Bing Crosby and Ginger Rogers and Ida Lupino and Gene Autry and Louis Armstrong . And there we were kinda peeking out between the cracks of these faces . I got the feeling he must 've spent a lot of time talking to these faces . Maybe even introducing the pictures of us to the pictures of all these stars . Trying to make a family out of us all . So we 'd know each other . LORRAINE Yeah , well he shoulda tried that at home first . SALLY You ca n't condemn him now . He 's dead . LORRAINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He shaped my whole life . Vengeance is the only thing that keeps me goin ' . SALLY How can you get revenge out of a dead man ? LORRAINE Because  --  he 's still alive in me . You understand that ? He 's still walkin ' around inside me . He put stuff into me that 'll never go away . Ever . He made sure a ' that SALLY That 's not him . That 's you . If you had n't had him , you'da found somebody else to throw the blame on . p. 113 LORRAINE Yeah , well you did n't know him like I knew him . SALLY Guess not . Because what I saw down there with Jake was a man who was totally innocent . LORRAINE Innocent ! That 's a hot one . SALLY Did n't you ever wonder about him ? About what became of him ? LORRAINE Who ? SALLY Dad . LORRAINE ( Sitting up ) Wonder ? Did I ever wonder ? You know a man your whole life . You grow up with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same bus together . You go through tornadoes together in the same basement . You go through a world war together . You have babies together . And then one day he just up and disappears into thin air . Did I ever wonder ? Yeah . You bet your sweet life I wondered . But you know where all that wondering got me ? Nowhere . Absolutely nowhere . Because here I am . Here I am . Alone . Just the same as though he 'd never even existed . SALLY I thought you said he was still in you . LORRAINE Not him . Some disease he left behind . SALLY But there must 've been a time when you loved him . Before . LORRAINE Love . Whata crock a ' shit . Love ! There 's another disease . Only difference is it 's a disease that makes ya feel good . While it lasts . Then , when it 's gone , yer worse off than before you caught it . p. 114 SALLY Well , I do n't think there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LORRAINE Yes there is . Oh , yes there is . You can resist . You can look it right square in the kisser and resist . ( LORRAINE lies back down . Pause . ) SALLY Maybe . Maybe you can . That 's what Jake tried to do . He 's a lot like you I guess . He started squirming in that trailer . Making up reasons why we had to get outa there . Get back across the border before it got dark . Dad kept wanting us to stay but he did n't have anything to offer us . And that 's when Jake made a desperate move . He did n't even know he was doing it . He was so desperate to get out of that situation , that he stands up and he offers to take Dad and me out to a bar . For a drink ! I could n't believe it . Dad 's whole face lit up . I 've never seen his face like that . He smiled like a little kid and grabbed his hat . LORRAINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . All he needs is an idea and he 's gone . Just the idea of straddling a bar stool in some honky-tonk somewhere in his mind . He 's gone . ( LORRAINE slowly pulls herself up to a sitting position and listens more intently to SALLY . ) SALLY They started right off with double shots of tequila and lime . At first it was like this brotherhood they 'd just remembered . But then it started to shift . After about the fourth double shot it started to go in a whole different direction . p. 115 LORRAINE That figures . SALLY There was a meanness that started to come outa both of them like these hidden snakes . A terrible meanness that was like  --  murder almost . It was murder . LORRAINE Whad'ya mean , murder ? SALLY Their eyes changed . Something in their eyes . Like animals . Like the way an animal looks for the weakness in another animal . They started poking at each other 's weakness . Stabbing . Just a little bit at a time . Like the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went around looking for the tiniest speck of blood on a hen or a chick and then he 'd start pecking away at it . And the more he pecked at it the more excited he got until finally he just killed it . LORRAINE Yeah , we had to boil that one . Tough son of a gun . SALLY They locked into each other like there was nobody else in the bar . At first it was all about sports . About which one of them could throw a hardball faster . Which one could take the toughest hit in football . Which one could run the fastest and the longest . That was the one they decided would be the big test . They decided to prove it to each other once and for all . So they downed a couple more tequilas and crashed out through the doors of the place into the street . p. 116 LORRAINE I thought you said he could barely stand up . SALLY Who ? LORRAINE Your father . SALLY That was before . Before he 'd had a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or somethin ' . That tequila went right into his blood and lit him on fire . He crouched down in a racing position right beside Jake . And they were both deadly serious . And then they took off . Dad took about four strides and fell flat on his face in the street but Jake never stopped . He ran like a wild colt and never once looked back . Straight into the next bar up the block . I went over and tried to help Dad up but he turned on me and snarled . Just like a dog . Just exactly like a crazy dog . I saw it in his eyes . This deep , deep hate that came from somewhere far away . It was pure , black hate with no purpose . LORRAINE That was him all right . SALLY He would n't let me help him . He just crawled up the street toward the bar that Jake went into . And there I was following along behind . I felt so stupid . He kept turning and snarling at me to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far back ' cause I was afraid somethin '  --  ( She starts to break down but stops herself . ) LORRAINE What ? p. 117 SALLY ( Trying to control it ) I was afraid somethin ' bad might happen to him and  --  it happened anyway . LORRAINE What happened ? SALLY Jake came up with a brilliant idea . He said , since we were only about a mile from the American border we should hit every bar and continue the race until we got to the other side . First one to the other side , won . First one to America ! But we could n't miss a bar . Right then I knew what Jake had in mind . LORRAINE What ? SALLY Jake had decided to kill him . ( Pause ) LORRAINE ( Throws the blankets off and struggles to sit up ) What in the world are you talkin ' about ! SALLY It was just the same  --  it was just the same as if he 'd had a gun . He knew what was gon na happen . Dad could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His knees were all bloody . Jake knew that all he had to do was push him over the edge . Just a few more drinks and he 'd be gone . LORRAINE ( Struggling to stand by bed , supporting herself ) That is the most lamebrained , idiotic piece of claptrap I ever heard in my life ! Jake might be a lot a ' things . He might be crazy . He might be wound a little loose in some areas but he would never , ever , in this world , try to kill his own father ! How can you say somethin ' like that ? p. 118 SALLY I was there ! I was right there and I saw every inch of it . I saw him killed ! I saw it happen . I saw him splattered all over the road like some lost piece of livestock . He was trying to run down the middle of a highway . He was trying to beat his own son to the border . He did n't even know what country he was in anymore ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was already sitting in some bar down the road ordering the next round of drinks . He never even got up when he heard the sirens . LORRAINE It was an accident ! That 's all . Just an ordinary accident . Could n't be helped . SALLY No , Mom . It was no accident . LORRAINE He did n't know what he was doin ' , any more than his father did ! SALLY He knew . He still knows . He made me promis . That 's how come he did n't tell you face to face . That 's why the cop came to your door . LORRAINE He is not a murderer ! My son is not a murderer ! Why is everyone trying to make him into this criminal ? First , that woman of his . He never shoulda got tied up with that woman in the first place . She 's the cause of all this . And now you 've turned against him . SALLY I 'm just tellin ' you what I saw with my own eyes . LORRAINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and watched your own father get run over by a truck in the middle of a Mexican highway and you 're tryin ' to tell me that Jake murdered him ? p. 119 SALLY That 's the way it happened . LORRAINE What about you ! Jake was nowhere near him you said . What were you doin ' ? Standin ' there helpless ? You were the only one sober and there was nothin ' you could do ? Is that the story ? SALLY Dad would n't let me near him . I could n't get near him . LORRAINE You could n't have gone for help ? Were your legs broke or somethin ' ? SALLY There was nowhere to go ! Jake had the keys . LORRAINE Jake ! Jake ! Jake ! You 're the one who killed him , not Jake ! ! You 're the one . If he was that drunk , you could 've taken care of him . You coulda got him off the road . You coulda dragged him . You coulda done somethin ' other than just stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? It was you that wanted him dead . It 's you that wants Jake dead too ! SALLY No ! LORRAINE It 's you that wants to undermine this entire family ! Drag us down one by one until there 's no one left but you . SALLY I 'm just sick of coverin ' up for him . I 'm sick to death of covering everything up . I 'm sick of being locked up in this room . In our own house . Look at this room . What 're we doin ' in here ? This was Jake 's room when he was a kid . What 're we doin ' in this room now ? What 're we supposed to be hiding from ? ( Long pause . LORRAINE stands there staring at SALLY , then slowly turns her head up and stares at the model planes. ) p. 120 LORRAINE ( Staring at planes ) I know one thing for sure . All these airplanes have got ta go . All these airplanes are comin ' down . Every last one of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind for me to save . It 's all goin ' . We 'll make us a big bonfire . They never wanted it anyway . They had no intention of ever comin ' back here to pick it up . That was just a dream of theirs . It never meant a thing to them . They dreamed it up just to keep me on the hook . Ca n't believe I fell for it all those years SALLY I did n't want him to die , Mom . LORRAINE Does n't matter now . He was one a ' them hopeless men . Nothin ' you can do about the hopeless . ( Pause ) You know what I miss more than anything now ? SALLY What ? LORRAINE The wind . One a ' them fierce , hot , dry winds that come from deep out in the desert and rip the trees apart . You know , those winds that wipe everything clean and leave the sky without a cloud . Pure blue . Pure , pure blue . Would n't that be nice ? ( Lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene 2 SCENE 2 Lights up , stage-left set . Night . FRANKIE asleep on couch , curled up , his back to audience with a dark blanket wrapped around him . Just as lights rise , we see BAYLOR drop himself heavily into the armchair , exhausted . He 's wearing a gray long-john top , heavy dark woolen pants with suspenders ( dark bloodstains on pants and shirt ) , heavy wool socks with the same boots from Act II but with the laces untied . He breathes heavily and makes a feeble attempt to lean forward and take his boots off but gives up and collapses back into the comfort of the chair , giving out a defeated exhale . MEG enters quickly from up left still in nightgown , bathrobe and slippers from Act II . MEG Baylor , could you please come upstairs and talk to Beth ? She 's got me worried sick . BAYLOR Help me off with these boots , would ya ? My back 's killin ' me . Some hunter . Leave all the work up to someone else . Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out 's another matter . ( MEG moves to BAYLOR , kneels and pulls his boots off . She stands again and keeps hold of the boots . ) MEG ( Standing in front of him with boots ) Baylor . BAYLOR What ! Stop houndin ' me , will ya ! " Baylor , Baylor , Baylor ! " I never get a moment 's peace around here . p. 122 MEG I want you to come upstairs and talk to Beth . BAYLOR Tell her to come down here if she wants to talk . I 'm not gettin ' outa this chair for the duration of the night . MEG She wo n't come down . BAYLOR Then have her send me a letter . There 's nothin ' wrong with her body is there ? Last time I saw her , she was walkin ' around . MEG She 's talking in a whole different way now . About stuff I never even heard of . I do n't understand a thing . It 's like she 's talking to someone else . BAYLOR Well , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but now she 's just scaring me really bad . BAYLOR Scarin ' you ? She 's your own daughter for Christ 's sake . MEG Well , she does n't act like it anymore . She 's like a whole different person . BAYLOR She 's the same person . Just leave her be for a while . She needs some time to herself . Yer always fussin ' with her so much she never has a chance to just be by herself . That 's the only way she 's gon na be able to face this thing MEG I 'm afraid to leave her alone , though . BAYLOR Stop bein ' afraid ! Yer afraid a ' this  --  yer afraid a ' that . You spend all yer time bein ' afraid . Why do n't ya just save all that fear up for when the real thing comes along . p. 123 MEG What 's that ? ( Pause ) BAYLOR Well , we 're not gon na last forever , are we , Meg ? Have ya ever given that any thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na give out on us and that 'll be it . Now that 's somethin ' to be afraid of . MEG I 'm not afraid a ' that . I do n't care one way or the other about that . I 'm afraid for my daughter . She 's disappearing on us . All I recognize anymore is her body . And even that 's beginning to change . BAYLOR How do ya mean ? MEG The way she stands now . With her shoulders all slumped forward and her head slung down . Her eyes staring at the ground all the time . She never used to be like that . BAYLOR She 's had a big shock to her system . Whad'ya expect ? MEG I expect her to get better . I expect her to come back to herself . She 's a million miles away now . BAYLOR Well , we handled yer mother for all those years . We can handle Beth , too , I suppose . MEG My mother was an old , old woman . Beth 's still a baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman ! She 's young yet , Baylor. p. 124 BAYLOR I know she 's young . What 's that got to do with it ? You think the powers that be hang around waiting for the right time , the right moment to bear down upon us ? You think they 're all sittin ' up there consulting with each other about her age ? " Oh , she 's young yet . She 's a baby . Let 's hold off for a while . " They could give a shit about her predicament or any of us . We 're all gon na get clobbered when we least expect it . MEG ( Moving to exit up left ) Well , I ca n't talk to you about it . That 's clear . BAYLOR Where you goin ' ? MEG Upstairs . BAYLOR Bring me in that Mink Oil before you go up there . You think you can remember that ? Last time you forgot . My feet are startin ' to bleed . ( MEG exits up left through hallway with BAYLOR 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and stares at FRANKIE , who 's still asleep . Pause . BAYLOR kicks the couch with his left foot , then flinches with pain , but FRANKIE remains asleep . ) BAYLOR ( To FRANKIE ) Soon 's the plow comes through , you 're outa here , pal . This ai n't a motel . ( BAYLOR kicks the couch again and flinches but FRANKIE remains asleep . ) You hear me ? ( MEG re-enters from the hallway with a tin of Mink Oil , crosses to BAYLOR and hands the tin to him . ) ( To MEG ) We got ta get this character outa the house . He 's dead weight . All he does is sleep now . ( To MEG , taking tin ) Thanks . Help me off with these socks , would ya ? I ca n't bend an inch . ( MEG kneels and pulls BAYLOR 's socks off while BAYLOR struggles to open the tin. ) p. 125 MEG Beth 's been talking about him . Saying his name . Did we know this man before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair ) Goddamn these tins ! They make everything nowadays so they wo n't come open ! Nothin ' comes open anymore . MEG Here , let me do it . BAYLOR ( Hands tin to MEG ) You do it . MEG ( Taking tin ) I am doing it . ( MEG pops open the tin easily and hands it back to BAYLOR . ) BAYLOR How 'd you do that ? MEG I 've done it before . BAYLOR Well , I can never get the damn thing to pop open . They used to have a little trigger on the side . Little metal pry gizmo . MEG They ' still do . ( BAYLOR turns the tin around until he discovers a little metal hinged bar . ) BAYLOR I 'll be darned . Thought they 'd eliminated that . MEG No . They still have it . BAYLOR Well , I 'll be darned . Would you mind puttin ' this on my feet , Meg ? My back is so sore from carving that meat , I ca n't bend over . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEG takes it . She hesitates. ) p. 126 MEG I should get back upstairs and check on Beth . BAYLOR Just do my feet , would ya please ! ( MEG kneels and starts to rub Mink Oil into BAYLOR 's feet . BAYLOR lays his head back on the chair and closes his eyes . ) MEG She 's just been talking so funny . Mixing things up . I ca n't follow her thoughts anymore . BAYLOR Aah . Boy , I 'm tellin ' ya , that is as close to heaven as I been in a long time . MEG ( As she rubs his feet ) Does n't it sting ? BAYLOR Little bit . MEG I should think it would . Your toes are cracked wide open . How can you do that to yourself ? BAYLOR I did n't do it . The cold did . MEG But you sit out there in that shack for hours on end letting your feet freeze . That does n't make any sense , Baylor . BAYLOR I ca n't stalk deer anymore , at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to me . MEG Is n't there some other hobby you could take up ? BAYLOR It 's no hobby . Where 'd you get that idea ? Hunting is no hobby . It 's an art . It 's a way a ' life . Everything gets turned into a hobby these days . p. 127 MEG Well , it 's not necessary to injure yourself like this . BAYLOR What 's " necessary " got to do with it ? MEG Well , I mean , we 're living in the modern world . We 've got the grocery store just four miles down the road . We do n't need to kill animals anymore to stay alive . We 're not pioneers . BAYLOR There 's more to it than that . MEG Well , what is it ? I 'd like to know . I mean what is the big fascination about standing out there in the cold for hours on end waiting for an innocent deer to come along so you can blast a hole through it and freeze your feet off in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deer season . That 's what you do . MEG Look at this . You 've got blood all over your pants and shirt . You look like you 've been , in a war or something . BAYLOR Just rub that stuff into my feet and stop tryin ' to pick a bone with me . I 'm too tired to argue . ( Pause . MEG keeps rubbing BAYLOR 's feet . BAYLOR keeps his eyes closed . ) MEG ( After pause ) Maybe you just wan na be alone . Maybe that 's it . Maybe it 's got nothing to do with hunting . You just do n't want to be a part of us anymore . p. 128 BAYLOR ( Eyes closed ) You 've still got the greatest hands in the world . MEG Maybe it really is true that we 're so different that we 'll never be able to get certain things across to each other . Like mother used to say . BAYLOR Your mother . MEG " Two opposite animals . " BAYLOR Your mother was a basket case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAYLOR opens his eyes , looks at MEG , shakes his head , then closes his eyes again . ) BAYLOR ( Eyes closed ) Meg , do you ever think about the things you say or do you just say ' em ? MEG She was pure female . There was n't any trace of male in her . Like Beth  --  Beth 's got male in her . I can see that . BAYLOR I 'm her father . MEG No . She 's got male in her . BAYLOR ( Opens eyes , leans forward , points to himself ) I 'm male ! I 'm her father and I 'm a male ! Now if you ca n't make sense , just do n't speak . Okay ? Just rub my feet and do n't speak . ( BAYLOR leans back , closes his eyes again . MEG keeps on rubbing his feet . Pause. ) p. 129 MEG She was like a deer . Her eyes . BAYLOR Oh , brother . How do you manage to get things so screwed up ? No wonder yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer is a deer and a person is a person . They got nothin ' to do with each other . ( Pause ) MEG Some people are like deer . They have that look  --  that distant thing in their eyes . Like mother did . BAYLOR Your mother had that distant thing in her eyes because she 'd lost her mind , Meg . She went crazy . MEG She was just old . BAYLOR Yeah , she almost took us to the grave with her . You and me 'd be a lot younger today if we 'd stuck her in a rest home when the whole thing started . MEG ( Still rubbing his feet ) I know what it is . ( Pause . BAYLOR opens his eyes . ) BAYLOR What ! What 's what what is ? MEG The female  --  the female one needs  --  the other . BAYLOR What other ? MEG The male . The male one . BAYLOR Oh . MEG But the male one  --  does n't really need the other . Not the same way . p. 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one goes off my himself . Leaves . He needs something else . But he does n't know what it is . He does n't really know what he needs . So he ends up dead . By himself . ( BAYLOR sits up fast . Pulls his feet away from MEG , grabs the tin away from her and starts trying to put the lid back on it . ) BAYLOR All right . All right ! Stop rubbing my feet now . Go on upstairs ! Go on . I 've heard enough a ' this . ( MEG stands . ) MEG Did I put enough on ? BAYLOR Yeah , that 's fine . Go on upstairs now . MEG You know , that stuff 's not really for feet . BAYLOR What ? MEG That Mink Oil . That 's for boots . It 's not made for feet . BAYLOR I know that ! Do n't ya think I do n't know that ! MEG I just thought maybe you did n't know that . ( BAYLOR starts reaching for his socks but ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GO ON UPSTAIRS NOW ! ! ! GET OUTA HERE ! ( Pause . MEG just stands there staring at him as BAYLOR trembles with rage , trying to reach his socks. ) p. 131 MEG You think it 's me , do n't you ? You did n't used to think it was , but now you think it 's me . You think your whole life went sour because of me . Because of Mother . Because of Beth . If only your life was free of females , then you 'd be free yourself . BAYLOR Well , you sure know how to speak the truth when you put yer mind to it , do n't ya ? MEG All these women put a curse on you and now you 're stuck . You 're chained to us forever . Is n't that the way it is ? BAYLOR Yeah ! Yeah ! That 's exactly the way it is . You got that right . I could be up in the wild country huntin ' antelope . I could be raising a string a ' pack mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no , I got ta play nursemaid to a bunch a ' feebleminded women down here in civilization who ca n't take care a ' themselves . I got ta waste my days away makin ' sure they eat and have a roof over their heads and a nice warm place to go crazy in . MEG Nobody 's crazy , Baylor . Except you . Why do n't you just go . Why do n't you just go off and live the way you want to live . We 'll take care of ourselves . We always have . ( MEG turns to go . ) BAYLOR Wait a second ! ( MEG stops , turns to him . Pause . ) Come and reach me my socks for me . I ca n't bend over . ( Pause . MEG looks at socks , then to BAYLOR . ) Just pick ' em up for me . You do n't have to put ' em on me . I can do that by myself . ( MEG crosses slowly over to his socks , picks them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pause . ) Gim me my socks ! My feet are freezing ! ( MEG moves slowly to BAYLOR with the socks and drops them in his lap , then turns and exits up left through hallway . BAYLOR struggles to put his socks on as he rages to himself but he ca n't get them on. ) p. 132 BAYLOR ( To himself , struggling with socks ) Everything should be reversed ! Everything should be reversed ! The worst part of your life should come first , not last ! Why do they save it for last when yer too old to do anything about it . When yer body 's so tied up in knots you ca n't even stand up to yer own wife . ( BAYLOR throws his socks down in defeat . He kicks the sofa and yells at FRANKIE . ) BAYLOR ( To FRANKIE ) Hey ! Hey ! ( Kicks couch again . ) Hey , you goddamn freeloader ! Nap time is over ! ( FRANKIE stays asleep . BAYLOR reaches out and pulls the blanket off him . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag you out of it with my own two hands ! ( FRANKIE stays asleep . Finally BAYLOR reaches out with his foot and pokes FRANKIE hard in the rear . Suddenly FRANKIE sits up , not knowing where he is . He grabs a corner of the blanket and tries to pull it back around himself but BAYLOR grabs the other end and they have a tug of war . ) BAYLOR ( Pulling on blanket ) No more blankets ! No more free rides ! It 's time for you to leave ! Let go a ' this blanket ! ( BAYLOR finally yanks the blanket away from FRANKIE . FRANKIE just sits there , rubbing this hands on his shoulders from the cold . He shivers . His eyes dart around the room , trying to figure out where he is . ) Now get up . Get outa that sofa and reach me my socks . ( FRANKIE just stares at BAYLOR . Keeps rubbing his shoulders , shivering. ) p. 133 BAYLOR ( Pointing to his socks ) See the socks ? ( FRANKIE stares at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you see ' em or not ? ( FRANKIE nods . ) Then pick ' em up for me , would ya and put ' em on my feet . My back 's seized up and my wife 's abandoned me . FRANKIE I  --  I do n't think I can get up . I ca n't feel my leg anymore . BAYLOR My feet are turnin ' to ice , here ! I need my socks ! FRANKIE Wrap the blanket around them . ( Pause . BAYLOR considers for a moment , then wraps the blanket around his feet . Pause . ) How 's that ? BAYLOR It 's not the same as my socks . FRANKIE Well , I 'm sorry . I just ca n't get up . BAYLOR Yer not injured that bad . FRANKIE ( Sudden recognition ) You 're the one who shot me , are n't you ? BAYLOR Do n't go gettin ' any fancy notions about suing me . I had every right to shoot you . You were on my land . FRANKIE I remember you now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff back here , boy . That do n't hold water in the back country . There 's not a lawyer within six hundred miles a ' this place . p. 134 FRANKIE I 'm not gon na sue you . BAYLOR Last lawyer who tried to come back in here , we cut his nuts off . FRANKIE Hey look ! Hey ! I 've got a bullet hole in my leg ! All right ? I 've got a bullet hole clean through my leg ! And you did it ! And it 's not gettin ' any better . It 's gettin ' worse , in fact . So do n't try to scare me with this stuff about lawyers , because I 'm not buyin ' it . I 've got a serious injury here ! BAYLOR Aw , stop complainin ' , will ya . I 've had my belly full a ' complaints in this house . FRANKIE Look  --  I do n't know why it is but nobody around here will make any effort to try and get me outa here . How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother with a real short fuse . He gets weird ideas in his head . It does n't take much to tip him over the edge . Now I 've been here way too long . Way , way past the time I was supposed to get back . And he 's gon na start gettin ' the wrong idea about me and your daughter . I mean , your daughter is his wife . You know that , do n't ya ? I mean I suppose you know that but it 's hard to tell anymore if anybody knows anything about anybody else around here . Like her , for instance . Your daughter . She is getting very strange with me . Very strange . I mean she started talkin ' to me like I was him . Like I was my brother . To her , I mean . Like she thought I was him and not me . Your daughter . Beth . I mean I do n't even know if she knows who I am anymore but  --  she thinks  --  she thinks her brother  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she includes you in this too  --  she thinks you and him , your son and you , are somehow responsible for taking her brain out . For removing her brain . Did you know about all this ? p. 135 BAYLOR Nope . FRANKIE No . See ? See , that 's what I mean . Nobody knows . Nobody seems to know . Nobody seems to have the slightest idea about what 's goin on . And meanwhile  --  MEANWHILE  --  I AM STUCK HERE TRYING TO GET BACK HOME ! AND NOBODY IS MAKING ANY EFFORT TO HELP ME ! BAYLOR Aw , pipe down , will ya for Christ 's sake ! Jesus God Almighty ! You 're worse than all the women in this house put together . FRANKIE If I die on you here  --  If I die , you 're gon na be in big trouble , mister . You and everybody else in this family . BAYLOR Do n't threaten me in my own house ! This is n't Southern California . This is Montana , buster ! ( MEG appears again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Baylor ? BAYLOR ( Pause , turns to her , leans back in chair ) What is it now ? MEG Beth 's coming down . She wants to talk to you . ( FRANKIE suddenly reaches out for the blanket and jerks it off BAYLOR 's feet , wraps it around himself . BAYLOR tries to grab it back but he 's too late . ) BAYLOR Gim me that blanket back ! Give it back ! That does n't belong to you . ( FRANKIE keeps blanket , wraps it tightly around himself so he 's covered completely with just his head sticking out . Like a mummy. ) p. 136 MEG She 's coming down here now , Baylor . BAYLOR Let her come , for Christ 's sake ! What in the world is the big fuss all about ? She lives in this house . ( Turns back to FRANKIE . ) Gim me back that blanket ! ( In the course of this last rant by BAYLOR , BETH appears beside MEG but BAYLOR does n't notice her . FRANKIE sees her and tightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bizarre combination of clothing . She wears black high heels with short woolen bobby socks , a tight pink skirt  --  below the knee , straight out of the fifties  --  a fuzzy turquoise-blue short-sleeved , low-cut sweater , green tights . She wears lots of charm bracelets and a silver chain around her neck with a St. Christopher medal , a gold cross and a rabbit 's foot . She has various kinds of snap earrings encircling her left ear . Her hair is piled high with a small white ribbon tied in a bow at the top . Her face is heavily made up with thick glossy pink lipstick , blue mascara and dark , outlined eyebrows . MEG takes her hand as she enters and BETH just stands there holding hands with her mother . After pause , BAYLOR still has n't seen her . ) BETH ( Soft ) Daddy ? ( BAYLOR turns to BETH . No reaction . Just stares at her for a while . ) ( To MEG ) Who 's this ? p. 137 BETH Daddy , I wan na ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at BETH ) What in the sam-hell have you got on ? What is that getup ! BETH I wan na get married , Dad . BAYLOR You go upstairs right now and take that crap off a ' you ! Take it all off and go jump in the shower . You look like a roadhouse chippie . ( Pause . BETH lets go of MEG 's hand and crosses slowly over to FRANKIE . FRANKIE recoils on the sofa , wrapped tightly in the blanket . BETH stops in front of him and stares at him . MEG stays where she is . BAYLOR stays in chair . ) MEG Baylor , she 's been tryin ' for hours to get up the courage enough to come down here and ask you . You do n't have to be so hard . BAYLOR Beth , are you hearin ' what I said ? BETH ( Staring at FRANKIE ) This is my man . This is the one . We 're gon na get married , Daddy . I 've decided . BAYLOR You 're already married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle in distance . Immediately on sound of shot , both FRANKIE and BAYLOR stand with a jolt . FRANKIE stands straight up on sofa , still keeping the blanket wrapped around him , supporting himself on his bad leg by holding on to back of sofa . BAYLOR supports himself by holding arm of chair . They both stare in direction of sound out toward porch . BETH keeps staring at FRANKIE . MEG and BETH pay no attention to the gunshot. ) p. 138 BAYLOR ( Referring to MIKE ) He 's got another one . How d' ya ' like that . I sit out there for weeks on end , freezin ' my tail off and come up empty . He gets two in one day . Life is not fair . ( MEG moves slowly toward BAYLOR . ) MEG Maybe we could have the wedding here , Baylor . That would be nice , would n't it ? Soon as the weather thaws . FRANKIE ( To MEG ) She 's married to my brother ! She 's already married ! You were there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To BAYLOR ) We could have it up on the high meadow . That would be beautiful . Just like the old times . FRANKIE I AM NOT GETTIN ' MARRIED TO MY BROTHER 'S WIFE ! ( MIKE comes running up porch steps into house carrying deer rifle . ) MIKE ( As he enters ) I got him ! I got him ! He 's right out there in the shed . I got him good . He 's right out there now . He 's not goin ' anywhere . He walked right into it . Right smack dab into it . ( MIKE crosses slowly over to FRANKIE , who remains standing on sofa . BAYLOR sits slowly back down in armchair. ) p. 139 BAYLOR ( Sitting ) Well , I 'm not dressin ' this one out for you . Not me . You can have the pleasure your own self . You think it 's so damn smart to go around shootin ' game without doin ' the labor . It 's time you put two and two together , boy . MIKE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove ? He 's out there , snivelin ' like a baby . FRANKIE Jake ? MIKE ( Goes to BETH ) He 's gon na apologize to you , Beth . He 's gon na make a full apology . Anytime you 're ready . He promised me . BETH Can you come to the wedding too , Mike ? I want everybody to be there . I want the whole family there . MIKE ( Moving to MEG ) He 's gon na apologize to all of us . You too , Mom . MEG Who is it ? Nobody has to apologize to me . Nobody has ever offended me in any way . MIKE ( Moving to BAYLOR ) He 's already begging . I got him beggin ' . He 's on his knees out there , Dad . FRANKIE You did n't shoot him too , did you ? What 're you tryin ' to do ? Kill my whole family off ? MIKE ( Moving to FRANKIE ) I did n't have to shoot him . I just scared him . Soon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 'd you do with that rack ? I want that rack ! It belongs to me . I 'm gon na put that rack on the wall . MIKE It 's out there too . It 's all out there . We can all go out and visit him . One at a time . He 'll confess to us . I broke him down good . You shoulda seen him . He was crawlin ' . I just kept him on his knees . I kept him there . You shoulda seen it , Dad . Every time he 'd try to stand up , I 'd knock him back down . Just hammer him down until he gave up completely . He gave himself up to me . He 's my prisoner now . You wan na see ? Just come out on the porch and I 'll go back down there and turn him loose . You watch . He 'll do anything I say now . I 've got him trained . BAYLOR I just want the rack . That 's all I wan na see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him . I 'll go get him and bring him up here to the house . You wo n't believe it when you see him . He 's not gon na bother any of us again . I guarantee ya that . ( MIKE exits . Pause . They all remain . Silence . ) FRANKIE Why did it have to snow ! ( Suddenly BAYLOR makes a lunge for FRANKIE , grabs hold of the blanket and rips it off FRANKIE . FRANKIE just stands there on the sofa . BAYLOR slowly wraps himself in blanket all the way up to his neck and sits back down in the chair slowly . Pause . Then BETH very softly moves in on FRANKIE , who just stands there , staring off in the direction of MIKE 's exit. ) p. 141 BETH ( To FRANKIE ) It 's all right . Once we 're together , the whole world will change . You 'll see . We 'll be in a whole new world . ( BETH embraces FRANKIE around his waist and puts her head gently on his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEG looks at them . ) MEG I think it would be wonderful up on the high meadow . We could invite the whole family . We could even have a picnic up there . Cake and lemonade . We could have music . We have n't had a real wedding in so long . ( Lights fade ) p. 142 Act 3 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 Lights up , stage-right set , on LORRAINE and SALLY . LORRAINE is dressed up in a dark suit , white blouse , with a bow around her neck , a dressy hat , high heels and stockings . She lies on top of the bedclothes with her back propped up with pillows , poring through one of several travel brochures . The kind with lots of foldout color photographs of European landscapes . Her purse is slung over one of the bedposts . Two large , open suitcases lie on the floor at the foot of the bed , half packed with clothes . SALLY 's suitcase lie beside the bed , ready to go . The chair is pulled out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of odd papers and paraphernalia from the men . SALLY sits on the chair in a dress and high heels facing audience , picking through the boxes and throwing different items into a large pile of junk  --  in a metal bucket on the floor in front of her . Included in the pile are all the model airplanes which used to hang over the bed . As lights rise on them , the two women continue their separate activities for a little while , LORRAINE avidly looking through the brochures and , every once in a while , making notes with a pen in a small dimestore notebook beside her . She also sips from a cup of coffee . SALLY keeps throwing papers into the pile , once in a while reading parts of an old letter to herself , chuckling , then crumpling the paper up and tossing it , then reaching into a box for another one . Now and then she comes across an old photograph , stares at it and throws that away , too . Once this quiet , introverted mood is established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , then holds it up for LORRAINE to look at SALLY ( Holding up photo , still sitting ) You wan na save this ? ( LORRAINE lowers the brochure she 's involved with and squints toward the photo. ) p. 143 LORRAINE What is it ? SALLY Picture of you in some parade . I do n't know . LORRAINE ( Going back to her brochure ) Naw , toss it . ( SALLY throws photo into pile , digs into another box . ) LORRAINE ( Lowers brochure again ) Wait a second . What parade ? SALLY I do n't know . How many were you in ? LORRAINE Quite a bunch . Lemme see it . ( SALLY gets up from chair , picks through pile of junk and locates photo again . She picks it up and takes it over to LORRAINE . ) SALLY ( Looking at photo , as she crosses ) Looks like the forties or something . LORRAINE ( Taking photo and holding it away from herself , squints at it ) Lemme see . ( Stares at photo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorville . Had a big " Frontier Days " blowout there . Big to-do . That was my sorrel mare . SALLY What year was that ? LORRAINE Musta been ' forty-five , ' forty-six . Right around the end of the war . Yeah , big barbecue , square dance . The whole fandango . Pretty little mare , is n't she ? p. 144 SALLY Yeah . Were you in a lot of parades ? LORRAINE Every chance I 'd get . Used to just love gettin ' out there with the sequins and jing-a-bobs and all that Spanish music . We had us a great old time . SALLY Dad went too ? LORRAINE Yeah , he 'd ride right alongside me . He had that big dumb gray gelding you had to throw down on his side every time you went to reshoe him . Dumb as a post . SALLY I did n't know you did all that . LORRAINE Oh , yeah . We lived pretty high there for a while . SALLY I never knew that . You wan na save this one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naw , burn it . SALLY ( Taking photo ) You sure ? LORRAINE What do I wan na save it for ? It 's all in the past . Dead and gone . Just a picture . ( LORRAINE goes back to her brochures as SALLY crosses back to pile of junk , holding photo . ) SALLY ( Reaching chair , looking at photo ) Okay if I keep it ? LORRAINE ( Reading brochure ) Fine by me . Do n't know what good it 's gon na do ya p. 145 SALLY I just like the picture . LORRAINE Sure , go ahead and keep it . That was one heck of a little mare , I 'll tell ya . She 'd go anywhere , anytime . SALLY ( Putting photo in her purse , hanging on the chair ) What ever happened to her ? LORRAINE She went with the rest of'em . One day he just decided he was sick a ' feedin ' livestock and he loaded everything into the trailer and hauled ' em all off someplace . That was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog dish . ( Pause . SALLY goes back to rummaging through the boxes , throwing things on the pile . LORRAINE studies her brochures . SALLY pulls an old letter out of one of the boxes , opens it and starts to read it to herself . ) SALLY ( After reading to herself for a while ) Here 's a letter from Frankie , right after he won that baseball scholarship . LORRAINE I found it . Here it is . Right here . Sligo County . Connaught . ( LORRAINE starts pointing excitedly at a big colorful map of Ireland . She holds it up to show SALLY . ) I 'll be darned . There it is , right there . SALLY Is that where we 're goin ' ? p. 146 LORRAINE That 's it . I 've still got some people back there if I can ever track ' em down . Been so long since anybody 's ever heard from ' em . SALLY What 's their names ? LORRAINE Skellig . Mary Skellig and there was a Shem or Sham or somethin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably her husband . SALLY How 're we gon na find ' em ? LORRAINE Oh , those little tiny villages back there . Everybody knows everybody . All we got ta do is ask . They 're real friendly folks back there . SALLY You 've never been there before , have you ? LORRAINE Nope . But I used to remember my grandma talk about it . She said they were all real friendly . We should n't have much trouble . ( SALLY continues going through the boxes and tossing things out as they talk . ) SALLY Did you talk to a travel agent about this ? LORRAINE They gave me all this stuff down at the Irish Embassy , or whatever you call it . That building with the green flag in the window . It 's not gon na be a problem . All we got ta do is get there and ask around . ( LORRAINE is now poring through a book and some other pamphlets as she keeps referring back to the map of Ireland . Pause. ) p. 147 SALLY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SALLY I mean , if you have n't had any contact with them for so long , maybe they wo n't even know who we are . LORRAINE They 'll know . All I got ta do is tell ' em my maiden name and they 'll remember . SALLY Are we gon na live with them ? LORRAINE No , no . We 'll just stay for a little visit . Save on motel bills . ( Pause as they continue their respective activities . ) SALLY Who are these people ? LORRAINE What people ? SALLY The uh  --  Skelligs . LORRAINE Relatives . Ancestors . I do n't know . SALLY Maybe they 're all dead . LORRAINE People do n't just all die . They do n't just all up and die at once unless it 's a catastrophe or somethin ' . Someone 's always left behind to carry on . There 's always at least one straggler left behind . Now we 'll just ask around until we find out who that is . We 'll track him down . And then we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult a task . ( Pause . They continue activities . SALLY pulls out a blue rosette ribbon , slightly faded , won at some livestock show . She holds it up for LORRAINE to see , then tosses it into bucket. ) p. 148 SALLY ( Standing behind pile of junk and boxes ) How 're we gon na haul all this junk outa here , Mom ? LORRAINE We 're not gon na haul it . We 're gon na burn it . SALLY I know , but we 've got ta get it outa the house somehow . LORRAINE What for ? SALLY Well , what 're we gon na do , burn the house down ? LORRAINE Why not ? ( Pause . SALLY stares at LORRAINE . ) SALLY We 're gon na burn the whole house down ? LORRAINE That 's right . The whole slam bang . Ought a make a pretty nice light , do n't ya think ? Little show for the neighbors . ( SALLY starts to laugh . ) What 's so damn funny ? ( SALLY stops laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORRAINE Well , ya light one a ' them Blue Diamond stick matches and toss it in there and run . That 's the way I always did it SALLY You mean we 're just gon na run away and let it burn ? ( LORRAINE picks up a box of wooden matches and approaches the pail of junk. ) p. 149 LORRAINE Nah  --  maybe we wo n't run . Maybe we 'll just stand out there on the front lawn , the two of us , and watch it burn for a while . Sing a song maybe . Do a little jig . Then we 'll just turn and walk away . Just walk . SALLY Well , we 're not gon na have any place to come back to , Mom . LORRAINE Who 's comin ' back ? ( Lights dim slowly as LORRAINE strikes a match and lights the pile of papers in the bucket . The fire in the bucket keeps glowing . Simultaneously , lights are rising center stage . From deep upstage center , JAKE emerges into the light , walking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his teeth and stretched taut on either side of his head , like a set of driving reins for a draft horse . Behind JAKE , holding an end of the flag in each hand , MIKE walks along , clucking to JAKE like a horse and shaking the " reins " now and then . The deer rifle is tucked under MIKE 's arm . They continue this way with MIKE driving JAKE downstage center . Lights reach their peak . MIKE rein JAKE in to a stop . JAKE remains on his knees . Fire keeps burning in bucket stage right . ) MIKE ( Pulling back on flag ) Ho ! Ho , now ! ( JAKE stops . ) That 's it . ( JAKE stays in one place on his knees as MIKE comes up beside him and takes the flag out of his mouth and rolls it up in a ball around his rifle . Now and then , he pats JAKE on the head , as he would an old horse . JAKE is silent . He has deep bruises around his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both hands . He 's in same costume as at end of Act II. ) p. 150 MIKE ( Removing flag , patting JAKE ) Atta boy . You 're gon na do just fine . Pretty soon we can take you right out into the woods . Drag some timber . You 'll like that . ( Rolling flag up around the rifle . ) Now , I want you to stay right here . You understand ? ( JAKE nods his head . ) I do n't want you wanderin ' off . I want you to wait right here for me . I 'm gon na go inside and get Beth . You remember her , do n't ya ? ( JAKE nods . ) You remember what you 're gon na say to her ? ( JAKE nods . ) You 're not gon na forget ? ( JAKE shakes his head . ) You 're gon na tell her everything that we talked about , are n't ya ? ( JAKE nods . ) Good . And you 're not gon na touch her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to her . ( JAKE shakes his head . ) Good . Now , just stay right here and wait for me . Do n't move an inch . ( JAKE remains on his knees , staring out toward audience . MIKE crosses with rifle wrapped in flag , toward stage-left set . Lights rise on set as MIKE moves toward it . BAYLOR is asleep in chair with blanket wrapped tight around him . Only his head and feet stick out . MEG is absent . BETH , in same costume as at end of Scene 2 , Act III , is tucking the throw rug from the floor around FRANKIE , who lies on his back , shivering violently on the sofa , head upstage , staring at ceiling . Light remains up on JAKE . MIKE walks up the porch steps and onto landing . He stops there and speaks to BETH , who remains involved with FRANKIE. ) p. 151 MIKE He 's ready now , Beth . You can come outside and he 'll apologize to you . You just stay on the porch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Referring to FRANKIE ) He 's shaking all over . I do n't think he 's getting any better , Mike . We ca n't keep him here . Maybe we could get married in the hospital MIKE Beth ! Forget about him now . Okay ? I want you to come out here and listen to what your husband 's got to say . I went to a lot a ' trouble gettin ' him to come around to my way a ' thinkin ' . ( Pause . BETH turns to MIKE . ) BETH Who 's out there ? MIKE Jake ! ! The one you 've been askin ' about all this time . The one you could n't live without . Your old pal , Jake ! He 's right outside there and he wants to tell you something . BETH He 's dead . ( Pause . MIKE stares at her . ) MIKE All right . ( MIKE makes a sudden , violent move toward her and grabs her by the arm . He starts to drag her toward the porch . BETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TAKE ME AWAY ! DADDY ! ( BAYLOR suddenly wakes up and stands abruptly . The blanket falls to his feet. ) p. 152 BAYLOR ( To MIKE ) What 's goin ' on here ? BETH He 's trying to take me outside . I do n't wan na go outside now . ( BETH pulls away from MIKE and runs back to FRANKIE . She kneels beside him by the sofa and strokes his head . BAYLOR seems totally disoriented for a moment , then focuses on MIKE 's rifle with the flag wrapped around it . ) MIKE Beth , you get back here ! BAYLOR ( Referring to rifle ) What 're you doin ' with that ? MIKE Dad , I 've got the bastard right outside on his knees . He 's agreed to make an apology to the whole family . Where 's Mom ? BAYLOR Never mind that . What 're you doin ' with that rifle ? What 's that wrapped around it ? MIKE It 's just a flag . He had it on him . He had it all wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could  --  BAYLOR ( Pause . Taking a step toward MIKE , kicking blanket away ) It 's not just a flag . That 's the flag of our nation . Is n't that the flag of our nation wrapped around that rifle ? MIKE Yeah , I guess so . I do n't know . I 'm tryin ' to tell you somethin ' here . The flag 's not the issue ! p. 153 BAYLOR You do n't know ? You do n't recognize the flag-anymore ? It 's the same color it always was . They have n't changed it , have they ? Maybe added a star or two but otherwise it 's exactly the same . How could you not recognize it ? ( BAYLOR is slowly moving in on MIKE , who backs up slightly as he approaches , keeping the rifle pointed low . ) MIKE Dad , I 'm tryin ' to tell you that I 've got him turned around . I 've got him totally convinced that he was wrong . He wants to confess to all of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flag touch the ground ! ( MIKE quickly raises the rifle so it 's pointed directly at BAYLOR but only accidentally . MIKE is still backing up as BAYLOR moves slowly toward him . ) Do n't point it at me ! What 's the matter with you ! Have you lost your mind ? ( MIKE quickly raises the rifle over his head . ) MIKE I 've got Jake out there on his knees . The guy who beat up your daughter ! BAYLOR Gim me that flag ! Hand it over to me ! Hand it over . ( MIKE lowers the rifle , takes the flag off it and hands it to BAYLOR . BAYLOR snatches it out of his hands . BETH goes to the blanket unnoticed by BAYLOR and takes it back to FRANKIE , covering him with it tightly like a mummy. ) p. 154 BAYLOR ( Folding the flag up and tucking it under his arm ) What do ya think yer doin ' , using the American flag like a grease rag . Gim me that rifle . MIKE Dad  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle over to BAYLOR . ) Have n't you got anything better to do than to monkey around with weapons and flags ? Go outside and make yerself useful . ( BAYLOR turns away from MIKE and heads back for his chair with the rifle and flag . Pause . ) MIKE So it does n't make any difference , is that it ? None of it makes any difference ? My sister can get her brains knocked out and it does n't make a goddamn bit a ' difference to anyone in this family ! All you care about is a flag ? ( He points out toward JAKE . ) It was him who was wearin ' it ! He 's the traitor , not me ! I 'm the one who 's loyal to this family ! I 'm the only one . BAYLOR ( Approaching chair , disoriented ) What 's happened to my blanket now ? MIKE Does n't anybody recognize that we 've been betrayed ? From the inside out . He married into this family and he deceived us all . He deceived her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause as BAYLOR stands by the chair searching for his blanket , still with flag , oblivious to everything else. ) p. 155 BAYLOR ( Looking behind chair for blanket ) How do things disappear around here ? ( MIKE suddenly bursts across the set and picks up BETH in his arms . She clings to the blanket and as MIKE tears her away from FRANKIE , she drags the blanket with her . BAYLOR pays no attention . ) BETH ( Being dragged away by MIKE ) NOOOOOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ( MIKE carries BETH across the set to the porch and down the steps to JAKE , who remains on his knees facing audience . He sets BETH down on her feet , facing JAKE , and forces her to look at JAKE . ) MIKE ( Holding BETH in place ) Now look at him ! Look at him ! Is n't that the man you love ? Is n't that him ? Is n't that the one you say is dead ? ( BETH shakes her head . ) MIKE ( Shaking her by the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on your feet . Stand up ! ( MIKE grabs JAKE by the collar still holding on to BETH . JAKE struggles to stand . ) Get up on your feet and tell her what you 're gon na say . Tell her everything we talked about in the shed . Go ahead and tell her now . Go ahead ! ( Pause as JAKE stands there , trying to maintain a vertical position . He stares at BETH . He tries to form the words but falters on them. ) p. 156 JAKE ( Softly ) I  --  I  --  I  --  I love you more than this earth . ( Pause . Then MIKE lets go of BETH and grabs JAKE by the shoulders . Shakes him . JAKE offers no resistance . ) MIKE ( Shaking JAKE ) That 's not what you were gon na say ! Tell her what you were gon na say ! We had it all memorized ! ( BETH suddenly runs back up the steps , still holding on to the blanket , and enters the set again . She stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sofa . ) MIKE ( Staying with JAKE ) BETH ! ! BAYLOR ( To BETH ) What 're you doin ' with that blanket ? BETH ( Looking at FRANKIE ) I was gon na  --  I wanted to keep him warm . BAYLOR ( Moving to BETH ) Gim me that blanket . ( BAYLOR snatches the blanket out of BETH 's hand and heads for the chair . He tosses the blanket on the chair but keeps hold of the flag . BETH stays where she is . ) BETH ( As BAYLOR moves away from her ) Daddy  --  ( BETH stays marooned in one spot with her back to JAKE and MIKE , facing FRANKIE and BAYLOR . BAYLOR starts to try to fold the flag up but makes a mess of it . ) Daddy , there 's a man  --  ( MIKE turns JAKE facing into the stage-left set. ) p. 157 MIKE ( Behind JAKE , hands on his shoulders , whispers in his ear ) Look ! Look in there . You see them ? You can go right on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even notice . They wo n't even know you 're an enemy . Your brother 's in there , too . See him in there ? He 's with her now . He 's with Beth . They 've been sleeping together ever since he got here . I 'll bet you did n't know that , did ya ? They 've been sleeping together right there on that sofa . Nobody cares , see . Dad does n't care . Mom does n't . Nobody cares . They 've just all lost track of things . Go on in there and introduce yourself . I 'll bet they take you right into the family . You could use a family , could n't ya ? You look like you could use a family . Well , that 's good , see . That 's good . Because , they could use a son . A son like you . Go ahead . ( MIKE pats JAKE on the back , and exits upstage into darkness , leaving JAKE at the bottom of the porch steps facing into the stage-left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't anyone coming to bed ? It 's nighttime , is n't it ? BAYLOR Meg , come here and help me fold this flag . You remember how to fold a flag , do n't ya ? ( BETH takes a few steps toward MEG , but it 's as though she 's isolated in her own world now . Neither MEG nor BAYLOR recognizes her presence. ) p. 158 BETH ( Moving toward MEG , then stopping again ) Mom  --  MEG ( Moving to BAYLOR ) I 'm not sure . Did I ever fold one before ? ( JAKE starts to move slowly up the steps and onto the landing . FRANKIE sees him now from the sofa . BETH still has her back toward JAKE . BAYLOR has handed one end of the flag to MEG as they back away from each other upstage , stretching the flag out between them . ) BAYLOR ( To MEG ) Do n't let it touch the ground now . Just back away from me and we 'll stretch it out first . Do n't let it touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( JAKE keeps moving slowly , from the porch right into the set . FRANKIE props himself up on the sofa , staring at him . ) FRANKIE Jake ? ( BETH whirls around fast and sees JAKE . Their eyes lock . BETH stays where she is . JAKE keeps moving . ) I been tryin ' to get ahold of you , Jake . I 've been stuck here . For days . I could n't get out . BETH ( Eyes still on JAKE ) Daddy , there 's a man here . There 's a man here now . p. 159 BAYLOR ( With flag ) Now there 's a right way to do this and a wrong way , Meg . I want you to pay attention . MEG I am . BAYLOR It 's important . BETH THERE 'S A MAN IN HERE ! HE 'S IN OUR HOUSE ! ( BAYLOR and MEG pay no attention to the others but continue with the flag . JAKE now inside the stage-left set , stops and stares at BETH . They keep their eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , then stops . ) JAKE ( To BETH , very simple ) These things  --  in my head  --  lie to me . Everything lies . Tells me a story . Everything in me lies . But you . You stay . You are true . I know you now . You are true . I love you more than this life . You stay . You stay with him . He 's my brother . ( JAKE moves to chair and picks the blanket up . He wraps himself up in it around his shoulders . FRANKIE struggles to sit up on sofa . BETH stays close to him . ) FRANKIE Jake ! Wait a second . Jake ! What 're you doin ' ? ( JAKE moves to BETH , wrapped in blanket . BETH pulls back away from JAKE . ) BETH I remember now . The first time I saw you . The very first time I ever saw you . Do you remember that too ? p. 160 JAKE ( To BETH ) Just one kiss . Just one . ( Slowly JAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lets him , then pulls back to FRANKIE . JAKE smiles at her , then turns and exits across stage right , toward porch , with blanket . FRANKIE struggles to stand with BETH holding on to him . ) FRANKIE ( To JAKE as he exits ) JAKE ! ! Jake , you got ta take her with you ! ! It 's not true , Jake ! She belongs to you ! You got ta take her with you ! I never betrayed you ! I was true to you ! ( JAKE moves down the porch steps and exits upstage into darkness . He never looks back . BETH very softly embraces FRANKIE and lays her head on his chest . They remain there in the embrace as MEG and BAYLOR continue with their flag folding . ) BAYLOR ( Folding flag with MEG ) Now , the stars have to end up on the outside . I remember that much . Who 's got the stars ? MEG I do . BAYLOR Okay . Then I 've got ta fold toward you . In little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag in triangles , military-style , toward MEG , who stays where she is , holding the other end . ) Now if everything works out right we should have all the stars on the outside and all the stripes tucked in. p. 161 MEG Why do they do it like that ? BAYLOR I do n't know . Just tradition I guess . That 's the way I was taught . Funny how things come back to ya ' after all those years . ( BAYLOR finishes the last fold and holds the flag up . ) There ! Look at that ! We did it ! We did it , Meg ! ( BAYLOR picks MEG up and twirls her around , then sets her down and kisses her on the cheek , holding flag up . ) I 'll be gall-darned if we did n't do it . It 's letter perfect .
