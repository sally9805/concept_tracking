Last fall , thinking of it as a kind of Christmas present given in advance , I offered to take my 9-year-old daughter , Medora , to her first Harvard-Yale football game . Actually , it was a selfish idea  --  an excuse to see my alma mater play against the Yales  --  and , as I expected , her enthusiasm was guarded . She has other ideas about Christmas . She has seen The Black Stallion six or seven times , and a horse , steaming in the winter air out on the lawn , is what she hopes to see through her window when she awakens on Christmas morning . It was easy to tell the Harvard-Yale game was n't even on her " list . " She looked at me gravely through the gray-green eyes she has inherited from her mother and asked , " What is it ? " // " It 's a football game , " I explained , " so important that it 's called The Game . There is no other The Game . A Yale coach named Ted Coy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never do anything quite as important in their lives as what they would be doing that afternoon . " I went on to say that Percy Haughton , the Harvard coach from 1908 to 1916 , had tried to get his players pepped up before The Game by hauling a bulldog , the Yale symbol , into the locker room and actually strangling the animal . // " He did what ? Killed a dog ? " Medora 's eyes blazed . I had made a bad error . // I explained that it was just a legend . " He never actually did that , " I said . " He could n't . A bulldog has n't got a neck . " I went on to say that what Haughton had done was ride around Cambridge dragging a papier-mch bulldog from the rear bumper of his car . That was how the legend had started . // Medora was n't placated in the least . " That 's even grosser , " she said , " pulling a dog around from the back of a car ! " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried hurriedly to explain that papier-mch  --  a word she had apparently not heard in her young life  --  was n't the name of a bulldog breed , as she suspected , but meant that the dog was fake . // I assumed that was the end of things . The Harvard-Yale game as a Christmas present was out . But the night before The Game , just after her supper , Medora appeared at my study door and announced , " I 'm ready . I 've packed . " // I was delighted . I retrieved the two tickets I was planning to give away , and early next morning we took the shuttle to Boston . The plane was crowded  --  many aboard , judging from the heavy coats and the predominance of blue and red in their attire , were on their way to The Game . Medora and I sat together . She was wearing a yellow jumpsuit , but the rest of her outfit , somewhat to my dismay , was blue  --  the Yale color . Her woolen hat was blue , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sneakers . " My favorite color is blue , " she said simply . // It worried me . I had ulterior motives ( besides the chance to see The Game ) in taking Medora to Cambridge . My vague hope was that she would become impressed enough with Harvard to think about working hard at her studies so she might go there one day . I knew it was n't important where she went as long as she approved of the choice herself . But I hoped it was n't going to be Yale . After all , it would be one thing to sit in the stands and root for her as she performed for the Smith College field hockey team , or the Rutgers gymnastic squad , or whatever , but to think of her across the football field joyfully waving a blue pennant and yelling " Bowwow-wow ! " with the Yale team poised on the Harvard goal line , while I raise a feeble " Hold ' em ! " across the way , is a possibility too intolerable to consider . // " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the plane . She pointed to a tall blue feather a man a few seats in front of us sported from his hatband . It had a white Y on it . " There 's my favorite letter . " When I asked her why , she said it was because the yacht club where she is learning to sail has a blue pennant with a Y in the center and she likes to see it snapping in the wind from the bow of the club launch . // " What 's wrong with an H ? " I asked . // " Well , it looks like a house with two chimneys that are too tall , " she said as she produced a note pad from her shoulder bag and with her brown hair brushing the paper , as she bent to her work , fashioned an H. She finished it with some squiggles of smoke emerging from both chimneys . // " See ? " // " Yes , " I said . // Her interest in yachting is another vague worry . Medora spends her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt . Her yellow slicker lies discarded on the lawn when she comes home exhausted ; retrieved , it is flung over a shoulder as she heads for Gardiners Bay the next morning . I keep hoping she 'll spend more time on the tennis court . She can hit a tennis ball with authority , although she seems slightly hesitant about how the game is scored . Surely that will come . I see myself , like John McEnroe 's father , peering out from under a white tennis hat , arms folded on the balustrade overlooking some exotic court , in Monte Carlo , say , and watching Medora move to the net under a high , kicking serve to Pam Shriver 's backhand. // Medora was looking out the plane window . I interrupted her reverie . " When we get to Cambridge , would you mind if I bought you a Harvard hat ? " I asked her . " We 're going to be sitting among a lot of Harvards and there 'll be confusion with all this blue you 're wearing . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show me from her shoulder bag . She produced a four-page handwritten " newspaper . " " Sherman Reddy and I are the editors , " she told me . The front page dealt with the November election . CARTER IS DEFEETED the headline read in my daughter 's recognizable penmanship . The subhead announced RAGEN WON THE ELECTION BY FAR . The news story was brief . It read : " Carter worked very hard but he was defeeted . In 1981 Ragen will be Presedent . Let us hope he is good . " Underneath this story was a poll on whether Ragen would be good . He got one yes and one no  --  the two editors apparently being not only the pollsters but also the sole respondents as well . I asked Medora , who was the only girl in her class to " vote " for Carter , what was wrong with President Reagan . " He laughs too much . He thinks everything is funny , " she said . The rest of the paper was made up of " advertisements , " most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish ... ) . There was one recently added story . // MEDORA TO SEE THE GAM // " It has an e on the end of it , " I said . // She brought out her pencil to make the correction . // " Perhaps you could do an extra on the Harvard-Yale game , " I suggested as Medora returned the newspaper to the bag . She said she would discuss it with her co-editor. // She had brought along some good-luck tokens she showed me  --  a stuffed koala bear in a miniature straw basket suspended by a ribbon from her neck . The bear was nestled on crumpled-up pieces of Kleenex  --  " to make him comfortable , " Medora said . She took him out to show him to me , revolving him solemnly between thumb and forefinger before returning him to the basket . " I hope he 's the right one , " she said . " I have another one , which looks exactly the same , who is bad luck . " // " How do you tell them apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really bad luck , " she explained , " I know I 've got the wrong one with me. " // " Perhaps you could throw that one away , " I suggested // " It 's better not to , " she replied . " In case the other is really bad luck . " // She then showed me an ivory whistle made of two intertwined fish . She said if the Yale players heard it they would , as she put it , " shrivel. " // The day in Boston was brilliant and cold ; the wind ruffled the surface of the Charles as we drove beside it in a taxi from the airport . I said that in the spring the crews came out on the river  --  " Eight men in a line , one rowing behind the other . The boats they row in are as thin as pencils , " I said , trying to be graphic . " They 're called shells . " Medora tried to look suave at this explanation . What an enormous amount of odd pursuits there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to make sense of them to a 9-year-old . We saw a number of sights that required my saying something about them  --  the scrum of a rugby game on the lawn of the Harvard Business School , the tailgaters along the banks of the river  --  " drinking cocktails out of the back of their cars , " was how I tried to describe it  --  the gay activist contingents chanting at the gates of Soldiers Field , the first raccoon coats she had ever seen . // We got out at Harvard Square . I had time before the game to show her part of the college We wandered along the walks . I tried to think what would give her a sense of the history and the character of the university and yet would he interesting to someone infatuated with horses and sailboats . As we walked through the gates into Harvard Yard I said that I remembered that the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric was by tradition allowed to graze a cow in the Yard , though no holder of that position had been known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows Medora seemed especially interested Was it possible to graze a horse in the Yard ? she wished to know And what about birds ? " she asked . " If I go to Harvard will I he able to bring Tiffany ? " Tiffany is her parrakeet . My heart jumped at her mention of the college . I said I was sure it could he arranged . // We started for Harvard Stadium . I bought her a wool Harvard cap and a large red BEAT YALE button . She exchanged the red hat for the blue one she had been wearing , but she dropped the button into her shoulder bag . I shrugged Perhaps it was too big for her tastes . Outside the stadium I bought a Harvard banner and a game program . // We found our seats and Medora almost immediately came down with an acute case of the hiccups . " Am I going to hiccup for the entire game ? " she asked me. // " I do n't know , " I replied . " What do you think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teams came out onto the field I opened up the pro gram to see who was who and discovered I had been gulled by a vendor into buying a Harvard Lampoon parody of the official program . The lead story was about a headless Yale player  --  Aemon Bonderchuk : " the horrible freak who hopes to lead the Elis to victory "  --  and , sure enough , there were some photographs doctored so that it indeed looked as if Yale had a headless player . According to the story , Carmen Cozza , the Yale coach , had been asked about him : " Aemon ? Sure . Nice boy . Good hands . Big heart . No head . " // I showed a picture of Bonderchuk to Medora . " Look at this . Yale has somebody out there with no head . " // " How awful , " she said . " Was it a Harvard person who did that to him ? " // After a while she said that she thought seeing the headless player in the program had startled away her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave a sigh of relief and looked out on the field . // " Does Yale have its bulldog over there ? " she asked , squinting toward the opposite sideline . When I said I thought so , she asked what the Harvard mascot was . // " A Puritan . " // " What 's a Puritan ? " Medora asked . // " He 's a man with knee britches and a tall conical hat with a buckle on it . People like him founded Harvard . " // As I brooded in the stands it occurred to me that there seemed to be so much more that Yale had to offer an impressionable young girl . Their songs were better . The bulldog , while hardly a comfy sort of animal , was infinitely more pleasant to have around than a Puritan , and he enabled the Yale songs to have catchy lines like " Bow-wow-wow . " Why could n't Cole Porter ( Yale ' 13 ) , who had written so many of those gems while an undergraduate , have gone to Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited until West Side Story before doing his best ? The Yale band was playing one of Cole Porter 's most memorable tunes , March on Down the Field  --  and I realized with a start that I was singing along , my lips moving involuntarily . // It did n't turn out to be much of a day for Harvard . The wind , which remained brisk and into which yellow biplanes towing advertising messages above the stadium barely made headway , played havoc with the football  --  especially , it seemed to me , when Brian Buckley , the lefthanded Harvard quarterback , tried to pass or when the Crimson 's kicker , Steve Flach , went back to punt . On the whole , the brand of football was spotty , as symbolized by a play midway in the game when Flach , back to punt , took a snap that skittered along the ground like a dog running for him , leaping at the last second for his chest and bouncing off . By the time Flach had the ball under control , the Yale line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball  --  the kind an elderly aunt might aim at a terrier nipping at her feet  --  and missed it . // The Yale middle guard , Kevin Czinger , picked up the ball and started for the goal line . There was n't a Harvard man within yards . A number of Yale men raced up to join Czinger , and it was while this pack of players was running unencumbered by anything more serious than a scrap of windblown paper scuttling across the field that Czinger suddenly went down as if he had run into a trip wire , apparently having stumbled over the heels of one of his teammates . A gasp went up in the stadium  --  not really of dismay from Yale fans or of relief from Harvard rooters , but at the realization , I think , that because the game was being telecast throughout the East , this dreadful pratfall was being beamed into any number of places  --  bars in Hoboken , N.J. or Erie , Pa. , perhaps  --  where people were quite likely scornful of Ivy League football to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the bar , they saw a Yale player , racing for the Harvard goal line with a football under his arm , surrounded by his fellows , suddenly stumble and collapse as if poleaxed . And they would never know that after the game it would be discovered that Czinger , far from having been tripped , had torn a back muscle . // The enormity of this , of course , was lost on Medora . I kept an eye on her . Every once in a while I caught her staring at the field in deep thought , lost in some internal consideration . Sometimes her lips moved slightly  --  a recitation of some sort and when she caught me looking at her , she would start and smile quickly , her eyes sparkling . Once she said , " Gee , Dad , that 's great ! " though I had n't said anything to elicit such a remark . She had her mind on something . // " What do you think of it ? " I asked . // " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she seemed to offer it as an afterthought , rather than what was really on her mind . // I had spent much of the first half attempting to explain the meaning of third down and 10 . My father has always said that there are two things that women , however brilliant , fail with great charm to understand : one is the International Date Line , the other is third and 10 . " Ask Lillian Hellman about third and 10 , " he once said abruptly at lunch . " See what you get . " I never did that , but Medora certainly did nothing to suggest my father 's theory was in error . " I like it better when they kick , " she said . " Why ca n't they kick all the time ? My friend at school told me that they have 60 footballs for each game . They keep them in sacks . " // Could she have been thinking of baseballs ? I said , " That seems like an awful lot of footballs. " // " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see . " // In the middle of the second quarter Medora said that she really liked the blue Ys on the Yale helmets . She announced it with a faint sigh , as if she had been making comparisons and had come to a decision . As I brooded over this disaffection , I was reminded that Alex Karras , the great Detroit Lion defensive tackle , had once told me that at the end of his illustrious career he had discovered his children were all Los Angeles Rams fans . They liked the way the horns curled up the side of the Rams ' helmets . " To think , " Alex said sorrowfully , " that I went out and slaved in the trenches all those Sundays to send my kids through school , getting my thumbs bent back so that I went like this in pain , ' AIEEE ! ' while all the time the kids were rooting for these guys across the line because they had nice-looking logos on their helmets designed by some interior decorator in Pasadena . " // The wind did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then again just after the third quarter began . Medora and I did n't see the second score . We spent the third quarter standing in line for a hot dog . The facilities at Harvard Stadium are notorious . The rest rooms were described in the game program parody as being " located under sections 6 , 7 and 31 of the Loeb Drama Center on Brattle Street . " It went on to call the stadium itself : " The oldest standing concrete structure in the United States since the collapse of a similar arena 16 years ago . In its present condition , the Stadium is capable of supporting virtually 2,000 people . " // When we got back to our seats Medora discovered that she had lost her good-luck koala bear . Apparently it had tumbled out of its tiny wicker basket . She did n't seem especially put out by its loss . " It was probably the bad-luck bear anyway , " she said . She reached in her bag and produced the backup charm  --  the intertwined ivory fish  --  and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to make the Yale players shrivel. // Medora 's mittens had disappeared , too . I felt her shivering . She curled into the sheepskin coat I was wearing . I took her bare hands and rubbed them . On one of her thumbs I noticed a face she had drawn with a ballpoint pen ; the back of her hand was decorated with a button with the word PUSH above it . // " What 's this ? " // She was embarrassed . " A push button , " she said . // " What happens when you push it ? " // She shrugged . " It starts engines and things , " she said . She was still trembling . // I suggested , " Start up the heaters . Your mother will think I 'm trying to kill you out here . Jiggle your feet . Then push the button for Harvard . They 're not doing very well . " // " Are they losing ? " she asked . // " I 'm afraid so . " // " How much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 10 minutes , " I said . " When you see the white handkerchiefs come out on the Yale side  --  then you 'll know . " // I tried to entertain her . We watched individual players to see what happened to them when the ball was snapped . I took another crack at third and 10 . I told her about the pigeon that had caught the attention of the huge crowd one year  --  a pigeon that had settled down a yard or so from the goal line . A number of people in the stands noticed that in pecking here and there in the grass , the pigeon seemed to go right to the brink of the goal line and then back away , as if forced to do so by some psychic power . The stands took sides . Megaphones were raised . Cries began to go up , " Go , bird , go ! " erupting from the far side and " Hold that pigeon ! " from the Harvard supporters . At the opposite end of the stadium the football players toiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound  --  standing in the huddle as a crescendo of pleading would give way to shouts of triumph as the pigeon , unbeknownst to the players , had turned toward or away from the goal line . Medora wanted to know if the pigeon had crossed the goal line . I said I could n't remember . // Medora began making a paper airplane from a page torn from the Lampoon parody . " I 'm going to fly this down to the field with a message on it , " she said . With her hands trembling from the cold she laboriously wrote a sentence across the inner folds of the airplane ; after creasing it and preparing it for flight , she wrote OPEN , OPEN along its length to indicate it should be read by whoever picked it up . // " What did you say in it ? " I asked . // She spread the airplane apart . The message read : YALE STINKS . RIGHT ? // How odd , I thought , as she showed it to me , that she should add that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to throw it for her . She wanted it to reach the Yale huddle . So I tried to do it for her , half standing and attempting to sail it into the wind . The airplane stalled and crashed into the hat brim of a man two rows down from us and fell off into his lap . He turned and could see from my expression , and the fact that my arm was still extended , that I was the one who had thrown the paper airplane . He looked , from the glimpse I had of him , like a professor or perhaps a Harvard overseer . He opened the airplane and read the message . He did n't look at me again . From the heavy set of his shoulders , I sensed that he was gloomily reflecting on an educational system that had produced a grown man capable of setting down such an infantile thought and in such execrable handwriting . I kept hoping he would turn around again and catch sight of Medora , who was giggling into the folds of my sheepskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard undergraduates began a melancholy chant of " We 're No. 2 ! We 're No. 2 ! " Across the way the handkerchiefs began to flutter in the Yale stands . Medora said she felt sorry for the Harvard team . I wondered vaguely if it was healthy to decide to go to a college because you " felt sorry " for its football team . // The game ended . The spectators in the Yale stands counted down the last seconds and the gun went off . I took Medora down to the field so we could hear the Harvard band and see what the field was like after it had been kicked up by the players ' cleats , and I eased her up to a Harvard player standing with his parents so she could see how large he was . A faint odor of liniment and grass drifted off him . She peered at the eyeblack above his cheekbones as if she were inspecting a painting . He must have felt embarrassed under her scrutiny . He turned away . I heard him say to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . You say she 's up at Dartmouth . What 's she doing up there ? " // Medora asked about his eyes . I told her that athletes often wore eyeblack to cut down the sun 's glare . She said it made them look neat , like Indians . Did the Yale players wear the stuff , too ? Oh yes , I said . She announced that she thought she might wear it out on her Sunfish  --  the glare was just terrific off the water . // We slowly headed out of the stadium , Medora holding my hand . I commented to her that at times during the game she had seemed distracted . Was something on her mind ? Had she had a good time ? // " Oh , Dad , it was great , " she said . " I liked the story about the pigeon . I wish you could remember if he went across the goal line . " // We crossed the Anderson Bridge and walked up Boylston Street past the Houses . I pointed out the windows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hung a hastily lettered sheet out the row of windows below . SO WHAT IF YOU WON , the message read . YOU STILL GO TO YALE . " // " Six U.S. presidents went to Harvard , " I found myself saying to Medora as we strolled along . " William Howard Taft was the only one to come out of Yale , if you do n't count Gerald Ford , who went to the law school there , and Taft was such an enormously fat man that they had to enlarge the doors of the White House to get his bathtub inside . Did I tell you that Harvard was founded 140 years before the Declaration of Independence ? " // " Yes , Dad , you did . " // I took her to some postgame parties . We went to the Lampoon building where in the crowded Gothic hall I pointed to a suit of Japanese armor hanging on the wall and told her I had worn it in a curious baseball game against The Harvard Crimson , the undergraduate newspaper . The Lampoon was famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd left , the editors had plotted to steal a battleship out of Boston Harbor . " They only had men on the board then , " I told Medora . " Now they accept women . You could be the editor . You could plot to steal a battleship . " I twirled the ice in my drink . It was my third . She stood , a diminutive form beside me , in the crush of the cocktail party . An undergraduate editor of the Lampoon turned up . I told him that I had admired the game-program parody ; I had been reminded that we had done one like it when I was an undergraduate . In fact , I could remember editing an article entitled , Why Harvard Will Not Go to the Rose Bowl This Year , one of the reasons being , as I recalled , that California was " in some kind of time zone . " // The undergraduate looked at me gravely over his plastic glass . " Fun-nee , " he said without a smile . // It was dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pointed up to the belfry . I told her the bells would be pealing if Harvard had won . They made a wonderful racket . In fact , the bells were something of a neighborhood nuisance because they were so loud ; the person playing them sometimes got mixed up so that it sounded as if the bells were tumbling down a rock slide . The Cambridge citizens complained . In fact , they threatened to shut down the bells . I told Medora that in revenge the great Lowell House legend was that all the people who lived there synchronized their watches and simultaneously flushed every toilet in the place . // " Why did they do that ? " Medora asked . // " It apparently puts a terrific strain on the plumbing system , " I said . " Floods things all over town . So it was a kind of weapon . It was to tell the Cambridge citizens and the college administration not to fool around with their bells . " // " I would like to have heard them , " Medora suddenly said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House plumbing , but it turned out to be the bells . " I wish Harvard had won , " she said wistfully , " so that you could stand here and listen to them . " // Impossible to tell about Medora . Did n't she want to listen to them , too ? // Not long after our trip I wandered into her room when she was n't there . Tiffany , her parrakeet , was scrabbling around in its cage . Her room has always been an irresistible place to visit from time to time to see what is new in there  --  to check on the detritus of her complicated schoolgirl life . A " secret " note from a school chum pinned up on the cork bulletin board . What she has dropped into her fish tank lately . The newest of the mice figurines she has added to a fearsome array on a shelf . // On her desk was a draft of a newspaper that she was apparently putting together as a Christmas present . Green holly leaves were pasted at each corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subhead , SCORE IS 14-0 YALE ON FREEZING DAY . Involuntarily , I glanced back over my shoulder , to make certain I would n't be caught prying in her room , and then turned back to read : " Harvard fans had little to cheer about yesterday as Yale handkerchiefs fluttered in the air . There was lots of cheering coming from the Yale stands . Harvard players slipped too much on the grass . At the end of the game the two gold posts were torn down by Yale fans . The Harvard fans went off to partys to drown their sorrows . " // A pile of photographs from newspaper sports sections were waiting to be pasted in . I recognized Earl Campbell of the Houston Oilers in one of the pictures , vaulting into a dense pile of tacklers , the distinction of what team Campbell actually played on being of little significance to the young editor . I could n't resist browsing through the paper . On the second page was a large advertisement for cats illustrated with a dozen silhouette studies of cats with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an imaginary shelf . Medora does a great many of these studies . // What caught my eye was a story on the same page under the large headline ( with a line through the second word , the spelling of which had apparently stumped her ) : BLACK HORSE BUYED . The text , again with a number of words crossed out , read as follows : " The black horse arrived in a truck shortly after nightfall . It was dark outside . His name was Abraham Lincoln Tom , Blueboy Prince ! " I suspected I knew then what those thoughtful silences I had detected on that chilly November afternoon were all about  --  not about whether she was going to hiccup or whether a pigeon had crossed a goal line or even whether she preferred Harvard , or Yale or even Princeton . Names were under consideration but not the names of colleges . // A small story caught my eye on the last page of the paper . The headline read HARVARD NOT DISCORAGED. // The story underneath , in its entirety , read : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
