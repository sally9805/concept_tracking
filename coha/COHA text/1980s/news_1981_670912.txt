Benjamin Hendrickson now has the title role in " The Elephant Man " at the Booth Theater . He has replaced David Bowie , who replaced Bruce Davison , who replaced Philip Anglim , who as the deformed John Merrick , was nominated for a Tony . The difference is that Mr. Hendrickson is more earthy than his predecessors . His Merrick is not so much innocent as wounded , and not so much intelligent as cunning . Yes , the differences are subtle , and in a role that depends so much on physicality ( the twisted limbs , the distended joints ) , perhaps they never can be much more than marginal . Consider , however , that Mr. Hendrickson is neither so pale nor so slim as his predecessors . This makes him less ethereal right off. // Mr. Hendrickson ' s Merrick quivers slightly . There is less quietude about him . " He ' s gentle , almost feminine , " Carole Shelley , as Mrs. Kendal , says . Well , gentle , yes ; but feminine , no . And although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , the persona is that of a bruised teddy bear . Watch Mr. Hendrickson look slyly at Miss Shelley while she deals the cards in Act II . There is wariness there , and an amusing sexuality , too . Mr. Hendrickson trembles with yearning , and he is touching. // Meanwhile , there is Miss Shelley , resuming the role she had in the original cast . Miss Shelley , bless her , is still the slightly soiled flirt she was before , and the end of Act I , when she takes Merrick ' s hand , is still one of the magic moments of theater. // ' A Chorus Line ' <> Age has not withered nor custom staled " A Chorus Line . " It opened at the Shubert on Oct. 19 , 1975 , but a recent Saturday matinee might as easily have been an opening night . The glitter was there ; the precision was there ; even the sweaty hysteria of the opening number was there . It was clear from the beginning that " A Chorus Line " hasn ' t lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now played by Deborah Henry . " A Chorus Line " is a perfect ensemble show , but some of its roles are more perfect than others , and Donna McKechnie , the original Cassie , won a Tony . Now Miss Henry exudes star quality , which Cassie is supposed to do , while not turning our attention away from the other actors . Her long solo dance - its style so different you are not sure it belongs in the show , and perhaps it doesn ' t - is also extraordinarily graceful . Maybe Miss Henry would have won a Tony , too. // Meanwhile , Bebe Neuwirth is tart , sullen and funny as Sheila ( that part won a Tony for Kelly Bishop ) , and Rene Clemente is touching as the homosexual Paul . If Mr. Clemente sentimentalized his speech about growing up , it would collapse in bathos . He does not , and so it is fine. // ' Piaf ' <> Once a week , at Wednesday matinees at the Plymouth , Judith Ivey replaces Jane Lapotaire in the title role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goodness knows Miss Lapotaire gives a bravura performance ) , but besides being bravura it is also flawed . Pam Gens , the playwright , hasn ' t given the actress who plays Piaf anywhere to take her character . Piaf is a waif at the beginning of the play and still a waif , though older and more battered , at the end . The burden of showing change , therefore , is on the actress. // Happily , Miss Ivey understands this . She grows in the part . Her Piaf is not gutter born ( whereas Miss Lapotaire ' s is ) , and sometimes she is nearly ingenuous . She is a coquette , and while there is less urgency in her performance than in Miss Lapotaire ' s , there is more likability . Miss Ivey flirts with the audience . " At night I do like someone to cuddle up with , " she says , and we are sure she does , not because she is desperate , but because she finds it pleasurable . Her Piaf likes men . She also likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems reasonable for this Piaf to grieve when Marcel Cerdan dies . We know she misses him ( truncated though their love affair is on stage ) ; we know there is a person buried beneath the messy , squalid and self-destructive compulsions . An actor may internalize or externalize a character ( Miss Lapotaire externalizes brilliantly ; the British have a gift for it ) , and when a play is cast in heaven , an actor may do both . In the meantime , we have Miss Ivey offering a performance that is different from Miss Lapotaire ' s . You may take your choice. // ' Deathtrap ' <> Robert Reed plays Sidney Bruhl in " Deathtrap , " although at the start of the evening , he hardly seems to be playing him at all . He is awfully quiet then , pondering , I suppose , Bruhl ' s diabolical plans , and sometimes the performance is so quiet that Mr. Reed seems to have disappeared from the stage . Actually , this is not so bad a thing ( maybe it is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who plays his wife , flutters and flounces . She rises to and recedes from panic , and gets an awful lot of laughs. // Mr. Reed grows on you , however . There he is at the start of Act II , clever and debonair , and not just peevish , which is what he was before , but positively ominous . He is suave , the way John Barrymore sometimes was in movies , which is to say kinky suave , and he is scarcely in danger of disappearing. // Elizabeth Parrish , as the psychic Helga ten Dorp , gets laughs , too . Miss Parrish overacts gloriously ( it is mandatory to overact in " Deathtrap " ; the audience expects it ) , especially when her Helga seemed to be going into a trance . For some reason , Miss Parrish kept reminding me of the late movie actor S.Z. ( Cuddles ) Sakall . He was Austrian ; Miss Parrish ' s character is Dutch . I don ' t understand the connection at all. // ' Dancin ' ' <> Bob Fosse ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgarity is the strength of 10 . Vulgarity is by no means reprehensible , and in musicals it can work wonders . When Mr. Fosse ' s " Dancin ' " opened at the Broadhurst on March 27 , 1978 , the vulgarity was redeemed by vitality , and the strength was invested in Ann Reinking . She was the quintessential Fosse dancer , and although " Dancin ' " was an ensemble piece , it seemed to be mounted and choreographed around her . Miss Reinking , however , has long since left " Dancin ' , " and consequently , or maybe only coincidentally , the vitality has left , too . " Dancin " ' is now at the Ambassador , where it barely fills the stage. // There are no jagged edges now or the frenetic quality than can make for attractive glitz . Without it , the work goes flat , and nowhere does it go flatter than in the places where the music wasn ' t very good to begin with . The choreography , for instance , for " If It Feels Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , is now pointless . On the other hand , the choreography for the Johnny Mercer-Harry Warren " I Wan na Be a Dancin ' Man " still has the virtue of easy charm . It never depended on glitz at all. // Meanwhile , there are fine dancers in " Dancin ' " - the lithe Lydia Abarca , the powerful Edmund LaFosse , for two - but they don ' t add up to a whole . To add insult , at the performance I saw , the orchestra warmed up to the point of being a nuisance ( the drummer kept hitting rim shots ) not only before the show , but also at both intermissions . There ought to be a law against that. // ' Evita ' <> " Evita " won seven Tonys last season , and even before it won them , it had established itself as a gigantic hit . Mostly , it was Harold Prince ' s staging that made it a hit , and mostly it is Mr. Prince ' s staging that will keep it running . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Evita " opened at the Broadway Theater , it was blessed with three fine performers in the principal roles . Now they have left the cast , and although comparisons with the actors who replaced them are invidious , they are also inevitable. // Therefore , one wishes that Derin Altay , as Evita , had more of Patti LuPone ' s urgency , and that James Stein , as Che , had more of Mandy Patinkin ' s bite . Miss Altay ( the name is Turkish ) is beautiful ; her Evita is a coquette , and sometimes she is almost pert . Her " Don ' t Cry for Me Argentina " is a love song to a nation , and Miss Altay is wonderfully appealing when she sings it . Unfortunately , her Eva is not wonderfully ambitious as well . A vulgar drive to power is what the show is all about. // Mr. Stein , meanwhile , does not display the manic energy that Che requires ; his passion seems to glitter mostly from the eyes . David Cryer , however , is perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low cunning , who turns malignant at the end . <> ' Children of a Lesser God ' // In terms of acting , the challenge in " Children of a Lesser God , " which is at the Longacre , is to make the romance credible . The lovers , after all , are a woman who neither hears nor speaks , and a teacher who not only hears , but speaks almost to a fault . In fact , he never shuts up . John Rubinstein played the teacher as a man of enormous charm , and watching Mr. Rubinstein , you sometimes had the feeling he was about to burst into song . For the role , Mr. Rubinstein won a Tony last season. // David Ackroyd now plays the teacher , and he makes him hipper than Mr. Rubinstein did and adds a touch of the antihero , too . " I make everything into a joke ? " the teacher asks in suprise late in the second act . The answer is yes because he has been making wisecracks ever since the start of Act I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his teacher also has something of the wisenheimer about him . This is where the touch of the antihero comes in. // In a way , the play now has a slightly new dimension . Good as Mr. Rubinstein ' s teacher was , it was hard to believe him when he said his mother was a suicide and his father a bad guy . Mr. Rubinstein just seemed too sunny for that . You believe Mr. Ackroyd ' s teacher , however , when he says it . Mr. Rubinstein ' s charm was sufficient to have won the woman played by Phyllis Frelich ( Miss Frelich also won a Tony ) ; Mr. Ackroyd ' s dark side is sufficient to break up the marriage. // ' Morning ' s at Seven ' <> Kate Reid is now one of the four sisters in " Morning ' s at Seven " at the Lyceum . She has replaced Nancy Marchand in the house on the left , becoming the sister who must worry about her husband ' s spells and her son ' s engagement . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ensemble qualities and especially praised the balance struck by the women who played the sisters . Happily , Miss Reid doesn ' t upset this at all. // All the sisters are a little askew in this gentle , funny play ( only a misanthropic psychiatrist would say it is about sexual frustration , sibling rivalry and Oedipus ) , and Miss Reid is at her most askew when she is standing still and only looking. // The fun in this is to watch Miss Reid when her husband , who is played by Richard Hamilton , falls , or threatens to fall , into his spell . This is only a matter of his standing with his head against a tree , or else going off on a long philosophical excursion , but it is enough to alarm Miss Reid . Panic starts in her eyes and spreads to her tremulous lips . Her cheeks collapse . Her body sags . She doesn ' t have to say a word to convince us she is acting. //             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
