Time to come up with a new knock on the Edmonton Oilers , if that 's possible . Team Imbalance has achieved equilibrium . Sure , Edmonton has half a dozen all-world skaters . In recent seasons , however , all the Oilers seemed to care about was offense . Even the club 's defensemen  --  a.k.a . Gamblers Anonymous  --  hogged in on the action . As a result , Edmonton games were right out of Shootout City , with scores that looked like tennis tiebreakers. // But in Sunday night 's 4-2 win over the Philadelphia Flyers in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals , the Oilers pleased their hometown fans by playing both ends of the ice at the Northlands Coliseum . Gretzky and company outchecked Philadelphia 's all-world checkers . More important , the Oiler defensemen , who never knew how to spell the word defense , stayed home like so many henpecked husbands and made life easy for goaltender Grant Fuhr. // " Gretzky , Mark Messier , Paul Coffey  --  they 're all you hear about , " says Edmonton president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randy Gregg is one of the most interesting guys in hockey . He just does things ... differently . // Randy Who ? // In the NHL , Gregg , 31 , stands out as the only player with a medical degree . Among the Oilers , he stands out by failing to stand out . That is , unlike his more illustrious teammates , the 6 ' 4 " , 215-pound Gregg never looks like a threat to break any scoring standards . Nonetheless , when the Oilers got off to a disappointing start last fall and were ailing at the blue line , they called on Gregg , who had been retired for all of five weeks . // " When he was n't there , the team was n't the same , " says Sather . " I thought we could fill the hole with some young guys , but the hole was too big . Guys like Randy who come out of college are usually better disciplined . Some guys get programmed to playing one way , but Randy can adapt right away when we make technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's his game , and I think he takes a lot of pride in it . " // Gregg is a thinking man 's defense-man , sifting options and calculating angles , as unobtrusive on the ice as a wallflower at a cocktail party . No movement is superfluous . No winger gets around him . " You do n't notice him out there , because he 's doing his job correctly , " said Detroit assistant coach Don MacAdam after Gregg helped run the Red Wings out of the Campbell Conference finals . " He anticipates so well he can stop a play before it has even started . " // " He is almost elegant for a man his size , " says Kevin Lowe , Gregg 's partner at the blue line during most of the playoffs . " He 's calm and composed , and he plays very well under pressure . " // Gregg , Edmonton born and bred , did not have a hockey career in mind when he enrolled in the University of Alberta 's premed program at age 16 . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills are pretty highly developed , " says Gregg , whose skills were n't . " The guys who are going to play hockey are invited to the prestigious camps . I was going to university to go to university , not to play hockey . " // So , while achieving honors in his courses , Gregg played two seasons in a community league . " Just for exercise , " he says . At 19 , the same year he was accepted by Alberta 's med school , where he would complete the final four years of his medical studies , Gregg decided to play varsity . " He was like a newborn colt , so skinny and clumsy , " recalls Clare Drake , Alberta 's legendary coach . // But Gregg 's oldest brother , Ron , who was in his early 30 's and an established anesthesiologist , encouraged Randy to focus on academics . " You can forget about all of this hockey b.s. , " he said . // The Gregg family had always placed a premium on hard work and achievement . Randy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregg . Roy , 72 , was a railroad engineer for 15 years . An all-consuming work ethic drove him , and he expected it to rub off on his brood . Randy remembers the day Ron came home from high school very pleased with himself for getting the third-highest mark of 120 students on an exam . " Why were n't you first ? " asked their father . // Roy supplemented his income by selling hoses and fittings for the oil industry from the back of a station wagon . Two of his daughters became registered nurses and a third manages an art gallery . Gary , the middle brother , took over the nascent oilfield-supply business , which today is Gregg Distributors , Ltd. // As for Randy , medicine was uppermost in his mind . " As soon as the hockey became too much , I was going to drop it , " says Gregg . " Little did I know how much I would learn . Clare Drake is the reason I am playing in the NHL. " // With classes from eight in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rink for 5:15 practice . " In four years , I ca n't remember him missing more than one practice , " says Drake . By then , Gregg 's coordination had caught up with his physical development , and he blossomed under Drake . He played on two national championship teams , and in 1979 he won the Sullivan Award as Canada 's best collegiate player . Then he made the Olympic team . // Gregg admires the strategy and playmaking that typify high-level international hockey . " Watch the Soviets , " he says . " They can change their forechecking scheme on a whim , four , five times a game . That 's tactical hockey , and that 's why they 're so successful . They are the Ali of the sport . " // At the Lake Placid Games in 1980 , Team Canada lost 6-4 to the Soviet Union . Gregg was captain of that team , and he yearns for one more crack at the Soviets and an Olympic gold medal . It is no coincidence that , shortly before he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted to allow professional athletes to participate in the ' 88 Games . Gregg wo n't discuss his Olympic ambitions in the midst of the playoffs , but this could well be his last NHL season . // The Canadians finished a disappointing sixth at Lake Placid , despite having beaten Team USA , the eventual gold medal winner , in four of seven exhibitions preceding the Games . But the Olympics were not a complete wash . At an obligatory meal with the rest of Canada 's Olympians  --  " the sort of thing where everyone wanted to be somewhere else , " recalls Gregg  --  the women 's ski team arrived . " That got our attention , " says Gregg . Then the women 's speed skating team walked in . " I noticed Kathy right away , " he says . " I was intrigued . " // " It 's funny , " says Kathy , who finished 16th in the 1,500 meters in 1980 and is now Mrs. Randy Gregg . " I remember that night , but I do n't remember noticing Randy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na believe that ? " // Before Lake Placid , recalls Gregg , Hockey Canada had offered to subsidize team members in international competition during non-Olympic years in order to hold the squad together until 1984 . But after the Games , Hockey Canada withdrew its offer . Still , Gregg was determined to represent Canada at the next Olympiad , so he remained an amateur . He became player-coach of a company team in Tokyo , trading in his Team Canada jersey for the crest of the Kokudo Bunnies . " The owner just admired rabbits , " says Gregg . " To him they were noble animals , or something . Of course , it was a little difficult going into corners trying to intimidate your opponent when you had a bunny on your jersey . " // Because the Japanese season lasts only six months , Gregg could complete his internship , which normally takes a year , over three summers at Edmonton 's Royal Alexandra Hospital . He was a dominant player in the Japanese Ice Hockey League , but two years away from home was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's amateur program , and when the Oilers offered him a contract in March 1982 , Gregg signed it . " I just could n't wait any longer , " he says . " If too much more time passed , I felt I 'd never get the chance to pit my skills against some of the greatest hockey players in the world . " // Thus began Gregg 's belated NHL career , which also ended his intercontinental courtship of Kathy . They were married in the summer of 1984 . Among the guests at a reception one week later in Edmonton was the Stanley Cup , the first of two that Gregg has helped the Oilers win . After Calgary eliminated Edmonton in the semis of last season 's playoffs , Gregg decided to hang up his skates and concentrate on medicine . // The first task at hand was to apply to Alberta 's orthopedic-residency program . Making that cut would be tough  --  the school annually chooses three or four from a pool of some 40 applicants . Then he sat back and waited . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Sather . Gregg had sent his retirement papers to the Oilers . From there , the documents were to have gone to NHL offices . Guess who sat on them ? // " I never filed them with the league , " says Sather , grinning wickedly . " I had a feeling he 'd change his mind . " In October , Gregg withdrew his application to Alberta and went back into training . // Even with a third Stanley Cup in sight , Gregg harbors some mixed feelings about his decision . Two-week road trips tend to drag a little bit more when you leave a young family at home , which , incidentally , is the same prefab house where he was raised . " It 's awfully hard for Kathy , especially with those two at home , " says Gregg . Those two are Ryan , just a year old , and two-year-old Jamie . This season , Jamie learned to kiss the television and say " Good night , Daddy ! " if an Oilers game was on when bedtime rolled around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he reapplies to a residency program , he will be up against a pool of voracious 25-year-olds fresh out of med school . " I hope that 's not going to be a problem , " says Gregg . " I 'm older than the other applicants , but maybe I 'm a little more disciplined , more efficient and time-effective. " // Says Ron , " Randy will never be a hockey coach . They have to take criticism well , and Randy does n't take criticism well . But if he wants to be an orthopedic surgeon , he 's gon na have a lot of catching up to do . " // Not to worry , Ron . Rest assured that , as soon as the hockey becomes too much , Randy will drop it .
