After 17 months , the U.S. effort to rebuild Lebanon has failed <P> In retrospect , it never worked particularly well as a nation-state . But during the late 1950s and 1960s , Lebanon was prosperous , relatively peaceful , more or less democratic , a relaxed oasis of tolerance for the Islamic world . Beneath its patina of tranquillity , however , stirred future troubles : a bewildering mixture of sectarian communities that had fought one another , on and off , for centuries . Two events brought the latent antagonisms to the surface : the decision by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the late 1960s to establish its principal base of operations in Lebanon , and Israel 's disastrous invasion of the country in 1982 . <P> At the time Lebanon became independent in 1943 , after 23 years of French rule under a League of Nations mandate , political power was largely divided between Maronite Christians and Sunni Muslims . This demographic equilibrium was jeopardized by the influx of Palestinian refugees following the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967 and Jordan 's 1971 crackdown on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975-76 civil war , to the presence of Syrian forces , and to the P.L.O .

Instead of merely clearing the border area , as Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his Defense Minister Ariel Sharon had promised , the army charged ahead to Beirut . The real aims of Israel 's Peace for Galilee campaign : to destroy the P.L.O. , humiliate the Syrians and reinforce Lebanon 's Christian-dominated government . <P> The U.S. finally brokered an end to Israel 's 40-day siege of Beirut , and effected a cease-fire to facilitate the forced evacuation from Lebanon of some 12,000 P.L.O . commandos . It then offered to contribute Marines to a multinational peace-keeping force that would act as a sort of police guard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind in refugee camps . But the U.S. pulled out its troops after only two weeks . A traumatic series of events immediately followed : President-elect Bashir Gemayel was assassinated , Israeli forces occupied Muslim West Beirut , and vengeful Christian militiamen murdered some 700 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila camps . The U.S. brought the Marines back to help restore order .
