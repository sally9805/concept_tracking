THE ABOLITION by Jonathan Schell ; Knopf ; 173 pages ; $11.95 <P> WEAPONS AND HOPE by Freeman Dyson ; Harper &; Row ; 334 pages ; $17.95 <P> There are now approximately 50,000 nuclear weapons . They have brought the world to a state of critical mass : the detonation of one bomb or warhead could touch off a chain reaction leading to the extinction of the human race . For a fact of life-the existence of those weapons-to be so bound up with the possibility of the death of the planet is an affront to reason and conscience alike . <P> Some of the best minds of the age have tried to rationalize their way around this ghastly paradox : the reliance of the human race for its safety on the instruments of its own destruction . <P> The leaders of the U.S. have made a policy of that paradox . It is called deterrence : if our enemy believes we will use our nukes against him , he will not use his against us . The Kremlin operates on a similar principle . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgo large-scale defenses to make their suicide pact more credible , but they continue to proliferate and refine their offensive weapons . In so doing they put their arsenals on hair trigger ; the danger grows that in a crisis or an accident , one or both fingers could twitch . <P> Many thinkers have recoiled from the logic underlying such a precarious peace . Instead of reconciling themselves to the existence of nuclear weapons , they call for their elimination , often in quasi-religious terms . But they have yet to come up with plausible proposals about how to achieve salvation . <P> New Yorker Writer Jonathan Schell sets out from the moralist camp and Physicist Freeman Dyson from the rationalist camp in search of common ground . <P> Both see the current balance of terror- " offense-dominated nuclear deterrence " - as the moral equivalent of slavery and call for its abolition . Hence the 19th century resonance of Schell 's title , The Abolition , and Dyson 's description of the nuclear arsenal in Weapons and Hope as " a manifestly evil institution deeply embedded in the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arguments : slavery , whatever it may have meant to the economy and social order of nations , had little to do with their security ; nuclear weapons , however perverse the argument for having them , are intimately connected with national security . <P> Both books first appeared as lengthy serializations in The New Yorker at the beginning of the year . Schell 's is a sequel to his 1982 bestseller The Fate of the Earth . That work received widespread praise for its passionate , sometimes overwrought meditation on the madness of mutual assured destruction ( MAD ) . Schell argued that the apocalyptic nature of nuclear war had rendered obsolete not only war itself but the concept of national sovereignty . He called on the superpowers to eliminate nuclear weapons and to " reinvent politics " by creating a world government loosely based on the pacifist ideals of Mahatma Gandhi . His message was ultimately defeatist : unless the world took his vaguely defined and wildly Utopian advice , it was doomed .               @ @ @ @ @ @
