In exploring the American Communist Party during its heyday in the 1930s and ' 40s , they decided to bypass the leaders , policymakers , and bigwigs who ran it . Instead , they went straight to the ordinary members - people who swelled the party ' s ranks , obeyed its orders , and followed its line. // This was a practical move , since it helped the directors organize their large and complicated subject . But more important , it helped focus attention on the aspect that fascinated them most : not Communist history or policy , but the human emotions , aspirations , and ideas that once led so many ' ' regular folks ' ' to involve themselves with the turbulent Communist cause. // The finished film , which has been nominated for an Oscar as best documentary , is by turns dramatic , informative , and remarkably funny . Relying mostly on present-day interviews , peppered with cleverly chosen archive material , it traces the ups and downs of American Communist activity from the large-scale marches and protests of the ' 30s to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the ugliness of Stalinism became overwhelmingly apparent. // None other than Ronald Reagan introduces the show , in a clip from a grim-faced anticommunist movie made more than 20 years ago . Other personalities cover a broad spectrum from the right to the left - old films of J. Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon on one extreme , conversations with musician Pete Seeger and a variety of unsung activists on the other . It adds up to a vivid , often surprising guided tour through a byway of Americana that ' s been overdue for serious cinematic attention. // No movie can tell ' ' the whole truth ' ' about a subject , of course , and ' ' Seeing Red ' ' is no exception . Its makers freely acknowledge their subjectivity , and even underline it by showing director Reichert as an on-screen interviewer . They also grant that their attitude toward the film ' s ' ' characters ' ' is a generous one . But that doesn ' t mean they celebrate the Communist movement . They aim only to examine the phenomenon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-dimensional treatment by standard movies and TV shows. // Thus the movie focuses on why people chose to join the left-wing movement , noting that some inflammatory Communist causes of the past ( the eight-hour day , the right to unionize , and others ) are taken for granted today . Many of the interviews point to idealism , not subversiveness , as a motivation for joining what movies have often shown as a wholly sinister enterprise. // With equal force , though , the movie zeroes in on the flaws and failings of the Communist movement , including many that seem self-evident today . Compassionately but relentlessly , the filmmakers expose deep contradictions in the party ' s fabric - how its patriotism faded into blind worship of the Soviet Union , for instance , and how its rhetoric about equality masked a rigid hierarchy . There ' s even a colorful interview with a woman who recalls how the local party bureaucrats didn ' t care much about females , but reluctantly allowed her to tag along with her brother . So much for feminism in the ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors Reichert and Klein the other day at the Manhattan office of New Day Films , a respected cinema cooperative they helped found in the early ' 70s . No , they said right away , neither of them has ' ' old left ' ' connections . While they consider themselves ' ' political filmmakers , ' ' they made ' ' Seeing Red ' ' largely because they didn ' t know much about the subject in advance. // ' ' I come from a real Republican family , ' ' says Reichert , ' ' and supported Barry Goldwater in college . ' ' Klein grew up faithfully watching the adventures of Herbert Philbrick on ' ' I Led Three Lives , ' ' a popular anticommunist TV series of the ' 50s . ' ' It was my favorite show ! ' ' he recalls with a smile. // Although their views have changed since those early days , and their knowledge has widened , both filmmakers own that ' ' Seeing Red ' ' was the most challenging project they have tackled since teaming up almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in private life , and have a 41/2-year-old daughter. ) // Among the questions they faced : Would former or present Communist Party members ' ' go public ' ' in filmed interviews ? And even if the movie could be completed , is the topic of communism so controversial that any approach to it would be instantly attacked from right , left , and center ? // They learned the answers as they went along . Yes , many people refused to participate - one such rejection , via telephone , is in the movie - and other people were too timid , when it came to this touchy part of their lives , to be good interview subjects . Then , when shooting and editing were finally complete , distributors declined to release the picture , deeming the topic too chancy for commercial success. // Reichert and Klein are documentary veterans , however . They spoke with some 400 candidates before choosing the 15 who appear on screen .

While the jury is still out on its popular success , engagements are slated in several major cities , and it has already opened in New York and California . The filmmakers are also experts on the large nontheatrical market ( libraries , universities , and the like ) which has welcomed their earlier projects. // As filmmakers and as people , Reichert and Klein feel social issues really matter . Hence their commitment to a probing , nonfiction cinema dealing with both historical and current concerns . Of all their films , ' ' Seeing Red ' ' is the first they have consciously aimed at a broad , theatergoing audience . If it succeeds , they may move still further toward a popular , readily accessible style . But their basic outlook - with its good-humored intelligence and openness to new ideas - will likely stay the same , which is good news for the movie scene. // //
