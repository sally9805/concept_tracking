Mrs. Langston ' s father , Frank Reed , is the head of a private school in Lebanon , and she has had no word of him since a group calling itself the Arab Revolutionary Cells - Omar al-Mukhtar Forces claimed responsibility for his seizure by gunmen in Beirut ' s southern suburbs nearly a year and a half ago. // Mr. Reed is one of nine Americans being held in Lebanon by fundamentalist Shiite Moslem factions backed by the Islamic Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran. // Like Mrs. Langston , the families of the other hostages have little information about the condition of their loved ones or the motives and intentions of the groups who hold them. // The State Department office assigned to the families , the Citizens ' Emergency Center , which once provided weekly doses of information and consolation , calls less and less frequently these days . " They ' ve been reasonable but I wouldn ' t say they ' re imbued with counseling skills , " said Marjorie Wilhite , sister-in-law of the hostage Alann Steen. // So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political speculation that surface periodically in the Middle Eastern press . But they live mostly on faith and hope that their fathers and sons will be returned. // As the weeks and months and in some cases years of the hostage ordeals drag on , the hostage families have come to accept that the plight of their relatives is no longer a central focus for the news media or the Reagan Administration . In their grief and frustration they have turned to each other for information and moral support. // The Feb. 17 kidnapping in southern Lebanon of Lieut . Col. William Higgins of the Marines put the hostages in the news once again . It rekindled painful memories for the families of those taken earlier as the familiar sight of a haggard American captive reading demands from his kidnappers flashed accross American television screens. // At the same time , it provided the hostage families with reason for renewed hope that in the search for Colonel Higgins , Lebanese militiamen may stumble over one of the other hostages , and that the American public and the Administration will be reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> ' On the Back Burner ' // " I think the majority of American people forget that the hostage situation is still in play , " Mrs. Langston said in a telephone interview from her home in Malden , Mass . She noted that the acquaintance who asked about her father had simply assumed he must have been released by now. // " I feel like the hostages have been shoved on the back burner , that some Americans feel these men got what they deserved because they were over there working in Lebanon , " she said. // Thomas Cicippio , whose brother Joseph , a comptroller at the American University in Beirut , was kidnapped on Sept. 12 , 1986 , keeps a sign on the front lawn of his home in Norristown , Pa. , listing the name of each hostage and the number of days he has been held . He added Colonel Higgins ' s name last week , the day after President Reagan was asked in a televised news conference about American efforts to rescue the marine and the other hostages. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages since the Iran-contra scandal , " Mr. Cicippio said . " Where ' s he been all this time ? " In Chains Watching TV The last information the Cicippio family had about Joseph came in 1987 , when a group calling itself the Revolutionary Justice Organization released Jean-Louis Normandin , a French television technician kidnapped in 1986. // Mr. Cicippio said Mr. Normandin called and said he had spent the previous 10 months with Joseph Cicippio. // " He said Joe was in good health , that Joe had taught him English and that they weren ' t treating him too bad , " Mr. Cicippio said . " All he could tell me was that they were in a room , in chains , and that once in a while they were allowed to watch television. " // Kit Sutherland ' s father , Thomas , the dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut , has been a hostage since June 9 , 1986 . Her mother , Jean , also a teacher at the university , has remained in Beirut to carry on the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in Beirut and we have no doubt that my mother interacts every day with people who know where Dad is , " Ms. Sutherland said. // The manager of a genetics laboratory at Colorado State University , Ms. Sutherland , 27 years old , and her younger sister , Joan , are preparing to mark their father ' s 1 , 000th day in captivity on March 4 with ceremonies in Fort Collins , 60 miles north of Denver . For months , the town ' s Main Street has been lined with yellow ribbons and its bus benches plastered with signs that say " Remember Tom Sutherland. " // The local newspaper keeps daily count of Mr. Sutherland ' s time in captivity , publishing a front page box to remind readers that it has been nearly three years . <> <> Supporter of Government // " I haven ' t lost faith in our Government , and I believe they may be doing things they can ' t tell us about , " Ms. Sutherland said . " I don ' t feel it ' s a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostage issue . I guess I fear that dissension gives the captors hope that the American people will pressure our Government for a policy change. " // In the early days of her father ' s captivity , Ms. Sutherland said , her inability to travel and speak was a source of guilt . That feeling has long since vanished , but a new sort of guilt has taken its place since the capture last year of Terry Waite , the Anglican Church envoy who had been trying to secure the hostages ' release. // " The most horrible part of this ordeal is that someone who put himself on the line for the others is now a hostage himself , " she said . " I feel tremendous guilt that he has been taken. " // Sometimes , Ms. Sutherland confessed , she has " Rambo fantasies , " an urge to be or find a romantic screen character who could burst into Beirut and rescue her father . But mostly she is pragmatic and hopeful , convinced that the best she and her family can do is keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Jesse Turner , was when his captors released a videotape just before Christmas . She too has talked to the released French hostage , taking comfort from his assurance that the hostages with whom he shared captivity were allowed to read occasionally , even though her son was not among them. // Living in Boise , Idaho , she feels isolated from other hostage families scattered along the East Coast , but she stays in touch by phone and mail . She has grown close in the year since her son ' s kidnapping to Ruth Polhill , whose son Robert was seized along with Mr. Turner and Mr. Steen . All three men were professors at Beirut University College . <> <> ' I Have Never Given Up Hope ' // " I have never given up hope , but I ' ve got myself steeled for the fact that this may go on a while , " she said . " Every once in a while , when I ' m walking to work , I let myself make plans for what it will be like when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage ordeal has been the longest . On March 16 , her brother , Terry Anderson , Beirut bureau chief for The Associated Press , will have spent three years in captivity . Mrs. Say has been the most vocal of the hrelatives and the most critical of the American Government for failing to take action to win their release. // Her efforts have earned her the hostility of some Administration officials and the admiration of the other hostage families for whom she has become a one-woman diplomatic unit and information center . She has traveled to the Middle East , befriended ambassadors of virtually every foreign embassay in Washington and helped organize public ceremonies to keep the memory of the hostages alive. // " I often feel like the little guy in the cartoon with the black cloud over his head , " she said . " I represent three years of failure . But I continue to make the rounds and I will speak out until there is no breath left in me. " //               @ @ @ @ @ @
