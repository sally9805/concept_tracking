A videotape made by a remote-controlled underwater vehicle shows dozens of amphoras , or large jars , on the deck , as well as a small cross and the ship ' s brass and silver bell , which was brought to the surface by the vehicle Friday . What appear to be coins and silver ingots are also visible. // A private business group that found the ship and plans to salvage her believes it may have hit on a multimillion-dollar treasure . Archeologists do not dispute that , but they say the find is even more important for its historical value . Although dozens of galleons have been found , virtually all have been in shallow water , broken up and with their cargoes dispersed by storms and currents . Only one or two have been found relatively intact. // " If it turns out to be an untouched galleon , and it probably is , then this is a very important discovery indeed , " said Mendel Peterson , former chairman of the Department of Armed Forces History at the Smithsonian Institution and former director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the work on the newly discovered ship , but has viewed the videotape . <> <> Name Not Established // " The importance of a site like this archeologically is tremendous , " said J. Barton Arnold 3d , former chairman of the advisory council on underwater archeology to the Society of Historical Archeology . " In a situation like this where everything is pretty much like it was left hundreds of years ago , careful study could open a window to the past that we ' ve never had before from a ship of this period. " // Galleons were sailing ships with three or four masts . One of their defining characteristics , according to the Smithsonian , is that they were big enough to carry both large amounts of treasure and the weapons to defend it . The newly discovered galleon , whose name has not yet been established , may be the first of several to be found as new technology is employed in the search for treasure ships sunk in depths that had previously made them unreachable. // Seahawk , a Tampa-based high-technology ocean salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to begin searches this summer for six other colonial Spanish ships sunk off the east coast of Florida in the 1600 ' s . Seahawk discovered the vessel last month and plans to announce it formally Wednesday. // Seahawk , a subsidiary of Fox Ridge Capital , had limited its work to deep-sea salvage of ships recently sunk , often working for insurance companies . But it decided recently that more money could be made from salvaging galleons and other colonial ships . New technology , using remote-controlled vehicles , makes it possible to bring up artifacts from a mile or more below the surface , compared with the 70- or 100-foot limit of the past. // Many archeologists and salvagers believe that Seahawk ' s entry into treasure hunting will transform that world from one of hit-or-miss wildcatters into a sophisticated corporate operation that runs a dozen recovery projects at a time and shrewdly controls the release of artifacts into the market . That prospect both excites and alarms archeologists , who are eager to see what lies in the ocean depths but fear wholesale plundering . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the leading salvagers of colonial wrecks , Robert F.

But the ultimate disposition of the material is unclear , and it seems likely some of the pieces would be sold . Seahawk , which seeks to be a profitmaking venture , says its costs so far have been more than $2 million. // " Good archeology is good business , " said Greg Stemm , one of the operators of Seahawk . " If we want to do other projects , we ' ve got to act responsibly. " // But some archeologists are not so sure . Many argue that shipwreck sites should be left untouched . Others argue that no artifacts should be sold , that even when found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they should be considered part of the public trust and given to museums. // " The Seahawk people say they are going to do things differently than other treasure-hunters of the past , " said James J. Miller , Florida ' s state archeologist . " We ' ll see . They seem to be aiming at keeping the artifacts together for a long time . But in the end , they ' re a business out to make money ; they ' re not a charity . " <> <> Studied Records for Years // Seahawk was directed to the site where it discovered the galleon by Mr. Marx , who for years has studied records in Spain of colonial vessels . The site is about 75 miles southwest of Key West , or about 25 miles directly south of Dry Tortugas . Two decades ago , shrimpers reported snagging pieces of pottery in the area , but the water was too deep for the technology of the day to explore. // At its most optimistic , Seahawk hopes that the vessel is the Merced , which records show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merced ' s sister ship , the Atocha , was found about 50 miles away in much shallower water in 1985 , one of nine galleons in a 28-ship Spanish fleet to sink in the area during a hurricane in 1622 . But there is no confirmation that it is the Merced . The bell brought up Friday is being examined for any clues to the ship ' s identity. // The ship lies in the route used by Spanish vessels as they returned , often laden with gold , silver and emeralds. from the New World to Spain . The ship , which the wreckage indicates to be about 120 feet long , probably sank shortly after leaving Havana. // Cameras have only skimmed the surface of the ship , which is covered with silt , and they have not yet probed the wreckage . As a result of pressure and temperature , what little wood is visible appears to be intact , with its edges still sharp and not rounded . Even pieces of rope appear to have survived . The ship ' s depth has prevented the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the water pressure , archeologists said , that it is possible the contents of the dozens of large jars on deck , which probably contained olives , are intact. // " We get very scientific about all this and try to use technology to increase our odds , " said John Morris , who heads Seahawk . " But you know there are no signs out in the middle of the ocean that say , ' Dive here . ' To be out in the middle of the ocean and come up with a ship ' s bell from 400 years ago , it gives you a bit of a shiver. " //
