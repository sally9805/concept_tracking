Explosive Clash <P> To the Editors : <P> " Will the Gulf Explode ? " The answer is no . As hot as the situation may be around the Persian Gulf Oct. 27 , it is not going to explode because there is still a good amount of wisdom in the land of the eagle and the land of the bear . <P> Dia E. Chatty <P> Los Angeles <P> Your cover showed the American bald eagle and the Russian bear , eyes glistening , watching the time bomb over the Persian Gulf . Is this the symbol of our current foreign policy-furnishing arms , along with the Soviets , and waiting to pick the bones of the victims ? <P> Edwin P. Peterson <P> Ukiah , Calif . <P> When will the U.S. realize that it must get out of the Persian Gulf before it is dragged into a war to protect its energy interests ? Now is the time to stop the demand for Middle East oil . <P> R. Daniel Laesch <P> Chicago <P> A good case can be made for the proposition that Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet and American statesmen engineered in Europe in 1945 . Such a partitioning would secure the oil of Khuzestan for our European and Japanese allies and , by restoring Azerbaijan to Soviet hegemony , would give them a buffer insulating the people of Turkistan from the virus of Muslim self-determination . <P> Such an arrangement would disabuse the perception of the small powers that when it comes to their vital interests , the superpowers are muscle-bound giants . <P> Holman Jenkins <P> Swarthmore , Pa . <P> Before the war in the gulf began , my blood used to boil at the very mention of Ayatullah Khomeini . But today I can not help sympathizing with the poor devil . His spectacular crusade captured the world 's imagination , and it is a sorry spectacle to see such an industrious personality faltering before his adversary and heading toward inevitable disaster . <P> Rajesh Joshi <P> Bombay <P> Your article could be the outline of a political soap opera . What is Assad 's real motive in his friendship with Gaddafi ? Can Saddam Hussein pull enough strings to promote his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Hussein and the P.L.O. ? Was there any hanky-panky at the last office party between Brezhnev and Assad ? <P> Tune in next week . <P> Barbara Coyne <P> Rock Island , III . <P> Adultery in the Heart <P> Pope John Paul 's statement that lust for one 's wife could be adultery in one 's heart Oct. 27 aroused hostility and opposition because it pricked the consciences of those who view sex not as a sacred union , but rather as mutual masturbation and a means to voyeuristic gratification . <P> Haven Bradford Gow <P> Arlington Heights , III . <P> " Thou shall not covet thy wife " does have the ring of a rather strange Eleventh Commandment . But I felt sure the Pope was not that stupid . He is n't . The full text of his talk is a magnificent treatise on the dignity of the human person . No woman , says the Pope , should be viewed only as a sex object . Not even your wife . <P> ( The Rev. ) Larry N. Lorenzoni <P> San Francisco <P> Brainpower  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
