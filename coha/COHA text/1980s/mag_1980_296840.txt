The men beaten by Reagan reflect on the lessons of losing <P> A leader is one who , out of madness or goodness , volunteers to take upon himself the woe of a people . There are few men so foolish ; hence the erratic quality of leadership in the world . <P> - John Updike <P> As the Republican Party plays out the final ceremony of nominating Ronald Reagan this week , there will be supporting roles for the handful of men who fought against him and lost . The television cameras will again broadcast their images , they will make their speeches , and one of them might even become the vice-presidential nominee . They will all praise Ronald Reagan , but in their hearts they all once thought themselves his better . <P> These men-Howard Baker , George Bush , Philip Crane , John Connally and Robert Dole-spent years of their lives in their efforts . They used up tens of millions of dollars of other people 's money ( plus a fair amount of their own ) , traveled hundreds of thousands of miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncounted meals of numbing mediocrity , and largely abandoned their families and their usual pursuits . All in vain . <P> When the battle was over , they limped back to their other lives bruised and disappointed , and in debt . They had played not just for power and prestige but for a place in history . Now their failure is there for everyone to see ; they are still a little touchy when asked to look back . <P> George Bush , who came closer than anyone else to catching Reagan , retreated quickly after his campaign to his summer home in Maine . There he revved up his 270-h.p. speedboat and raced over the waves at 40-knot speeds , as if fleeing the memory of his defeat . In an interview with TIME Correspondent Douglas Brew , Bush admitted : " I 'm still a little grumpy . I just do n't want to talk about it yet . It 's too soon . I 'm sorting out what the hell I 'll do with my life . " <P> Observes Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into it . But I have n't sorted it out yet . You know , little flashes of insight here and there . But that is still too fresh to deal with . " Yet , with the exception of John Connally , who declined to speak about his campaign at all , the other four major challengers did agree to review their experience in campaigning for the presidency . Unlike other political experts , these men have actually lived through the process . <P> Each of them entered the race believing he had a reasonable chance of winning . Says Dole : " I have a really good record in the Senate as far as food stamps , handicapped , or nutrition or health care . I thought naively you could build a constituency with farmers and business people and health professionals and the handicapped and whatever , but we could not , did not . " <P> They were in many ways unprepared for the enormousness of their undertaking . Says Baker : " I just found I had a lot to learn . It does n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . You never know how to run for President until you try to run for it . "
