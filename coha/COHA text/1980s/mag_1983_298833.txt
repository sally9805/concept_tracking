New translations seek to rid the Bible of " male bias " <P> For millions of Americans , no publication is awaited more eagerly than a fresh translation of the biblical texts that are so important to their practice of religion . In the past , even relatively minor changes have caused an uproar , but they pale beside the revisions in a radical new version of scriptural readings that was released last week . The translations alter or eradicate beloved phrases that have stood for millenniums . God in heaven is no longer just the Father but the " Father and Mother " ( or " Mother and Father " ) . The Deity is addressed as " Sovereign One , " but never as the " Lord . " Jesus Christ is no longer designated as either the Son of God or the Son of man . <P> These unconventional translations are not the product of some eccentric scholar or self-appointed caucus , but of the National Council of Churches , supported by 32 Protestant and Orthodox denominations with 40 million members . The N.C.C . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of the " male bias " in Scripture that militant feminists have been complaining about for nearly a decade . To proponents , the book is an advance toward equal treatment . To opponents , the translations are tasteless , if not heretical . <P> The N.C.C . book of readings , offered for " experimental and voluntary use in churches , " remarkably affects the imagery and impact of many of the best-known Bible passages . Additions to the original text are set off in brackets . For instance , " All things have been delivered to me by my Father ; and no one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him , " ( Matthew 11 : 27 ) becomes " All things have been delivered to me by God my Father and Mother ; and no one knows the Child except God , and no one knows God except the Child and any one to whom the Child chooses to reveal God .

But the heads of two major N.C.C . churches disowned the book . Said Archbishop lakovos of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese ( 2 million members ) : " It does not reflect the traditions and reverence of the Holy Scriptures . " Bishop James R. Crumley Jr . of the Lutheran Church in America ( 2.9 million members ) advised congregations not to read the book during worship services . <P> The task of taking the male orientation out of the Scriptures began in the 1970s , when women 's caucuses in several Protestant denominations persuaded the N.C.C . to establish a Task Force on Sexism in the Bible . In 1980 , the N.C.C . decided to form an Inclusive Language Lectionary Committee to prepare new Bible translations for reading during worship . Even before work began , the idea provoked the fiercest reaction in N.C.C . annals ; nearly 10,000 letters attacking the project flooded into the organization 's New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
