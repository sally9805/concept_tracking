The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that no religion can be advanced in the public schools . But in two cases of potential national impact , one in eastern Tennessee and the other in Mobile , Ala. , fundamentalist parents have won the right to press their assertion that the reading materials their children are exposed to in school are colored by anti-Christian themes. // In Church Hill , Tenn. , where the school board has stood firm against them , the parents are seeking the Federal District Court ' s sanction to shield their children from such books. // In Mobile , where the plaintiffs seem to have found a sympathetic Federal district judge , they are asking his court to remove from the curriculum the influence of " secular humanism , " which to them , is a godless religion that is profoundly antithetical to biblical morality. // If the plaintiffs win their case in Alabama , where Gov . George C. Wallace and the local school board have now embraced their position , they will have engaged the authority of the Federal courts in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible // " There ' s a widespread feeling amongst conservative Christians that the religion of secular humanism has permeated public education , " says Michael Farris , general counsel to Concerned Women for America , the Washington lobby that is financing the Tennessee plaintiffs. // Mr. Farris takes the Bible literally . " Any thinking person does , " he says . And to avoid exposing his children to what they see as the corruptive influence of the public schools , he and his wife teach them at home. // More than three years ago , ruling in an earlier phase of the textbook case , Judge Brevard Hand of Mobile indicated that to some extent he shared that perspective . " It is common knowledge that miscellaneous doctrines such as evolution , socialism , Communism , secularism , humanism and other concepts are advanced in the public schools , " Judge Hand wrote. // " Reading , teaching or advancing biblical principles , however , is strictly prohibited , " he added . " It is time to recognize that the constitutional definition of religion encompasses more than Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion. " // In January 1983 , Judge Hand upheld an Alabama law authorizing a moment of silent prayer in the schools , saying that the Supreme Court had erred in finding that the Bill of Rights prohibited a state from establishing a religion . <> <> Acting on a Footnote // After the Supreme Court reversed Judge Hand on appeal , stating , " In the relationship between man and religion , the state is firmly committed to a position of neutrality , " Judge Hand exercised the right he had reserved to himself in a footnote to his original decision . The judge indicated in that footnote that if he was overruled on the prayer issue he would look into whether other forms of religion were being promoted in the curriculum. // When the case came back to Judge Hand , the plaintiff who had challenged the prayer law , having won his point on appeal , dropped out . Judge Hand then realigned the case , making plaintiffs of the 624 parents , teachers and students who originally intervened to help defend the law . It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school curriculum. // " What we are asking is that this strict neutrality concept be evenly applied , " said Thomas F. Parker , one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs . " It ' s already been equally applied to remove Judaism and Christianity from the schools . We ' re asking that it be equally applied to remove humanism. " // As evidence of the removal of Christian context from school instruction , Mr. Parker cited a passage in an Alabama textbook dealing with the Pilgrims and their first Thanksgiving . " There is no mention of why they came to this country , " Mr. Parker said , " or who they were giving thanks to . " <> <> ' Citizens of the World ' Cited // " It ' s just censored out , " Mr. Parker said . " It sends the message that religion is irrelevant. " // Civil libertarians and other critics contend that conservative Christians use the term " secular humanism " to describe anything with which they disagree . " Anything in the school curriculum or in society that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular humanism as an example of it , " says Barbara Parker of People for the American Way , a watchdog organization founded by the television producer Norman Lear to monitor the religious new right. // In Longview , Tex . , Mel and Norma Gabler review public school materials and publish examples of the influence of " humanism in textbooks " that are frequently used as guides by fundamentalist parents. // The observation in a high school government text that " in many important respects , we are also citizens of the world " is cited by them as an example of the humanist emphasis on " global citizenship " instead of " national self-determination. " // The small group of parents in Church Hill , Tenn. , after studying the Gablers ' guides , objected to a reading series approved by the state of Tennessee . In one first-grade reader , Robert B. Mozert Jr. , complained in a letter to the editor of The Kingsport Times News , " ' Jim cooks ' while the little girl reads . " <> <> Suit for False Arrest // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mozert added , but it has already been " planted in the first graders ' mind that there are no God-given roles for the different sexes. " // The school board refused the parents ' demands for alternative readers . Vicki Frost , the most vocal of the complaining parents , was arrested for trespassing at her daughter ' s school . Her suit for damages for false arrest is to be heard in Federal District Court in Greeneville , Tenn. , next month . A second suit , asking the court to establish that children can not be compelled to read materials that violate their religious beliefs , is expected to be heard later. // People for the American Way is providing legal help for the defense in both the Alabama and Tennessee cases . The American Civil Liberties Union in Alabama is also involved in the defense side in the Mobile case , while the Freedom Council Foundation , a group established by the television evangelist Pat Robertson , is helping to meet the plaintiffs ' expenses. // The Mobile lawsuit had proceeded without much notice until early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Governor Wallace , almost 90 days earlier , joined the plaintiffs . With no public notice , the Governor ' s legal adviser signed a legal stipulation saying that " the Governor of Alabama agrees that humanism is a religion , " that " the advancement of humanism in public school textbooks would violate the First Amendment , " that " the roles of Protestantism , Catholicism and Judaism have been excluded from textbooks used in the public schools of Alabama , " that such censorship " constitutes unconstitutional discrimination against religion in violation of the First Amendment , " and that the Governor consents to let the Federal court approve new standards of textbook selection for the state . <> <> Letters and Postcards // Judge Hand is waiting to see if the state school board will follow the lead of the Governor and the local school board , giving the plaintiffs a victory without benefit of trial , a victory that would give the Federal court the authority to approve or reject textbooks . The board said today that it would discuss the matter March 13. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 to 2 to approve a consent document similar to the one signed by the Governor ' s adviser . The three whites on the board voted for the agreement ; the two blacks were against it . Dr. Robert W. Gilliard , a black dentist who is vice president of the board , said : " This is what you call committing hari kari . " If he had voted " to allow people to tear pages out of our school books , " Dr. Gilliard said , " I would be derelict in my duties of the school board. " // The local board ' s vote leaves the State Board of Education virtually alone in defending the lawsuit , and some of its members are ready to give in . " It ' s extremely strange , " said John M. Tyson Jr. , vice chairman of the board . " I can tell you that the reason they are considering it is because they are getting bombarded with calls and letters and postcards. " // Judge Hand last week granted the request of a small group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . The intervenors are represented by William A. Bradford Jr. of the Washington law firm of Hogan &; Hartson , which is donating his services . People for the American Way and the Alabama A.C.L.U. are paying his expenses. // If the plaintiffs win a Federal court order establishing " secular humanism " as a religion whose evidence must be purged from school materials , Mr. Bradford said , " Every school board in the country is going to be confronted with it . And it will wreak havoc and confusion until it is reversed. " //
