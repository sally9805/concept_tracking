Scene begins with dim light coming up on the naked figure of SENATOR ARMITRAGE 'S DREAM SELF scurrying about on the floor . This is downstage of the darkened living-room ensemble , where the SENATOR himself is seated , talking to the MAN IN ARABIAN HEAD-DRESS . Sound of wind is faintly audible . SENATOR ARMITRAGE I had a dream I was Scrambling around , Confused , in a strange Place ; I had lost Something , lost Something precious I 've lost my soul . SENATOR 'S DREAM SELF He points to an OLD MAN in an aviator suit with a long , white , flowing beard who appears in a ball of light atop a rickety stepladder . The OLD MAN has a pair of wings that he slowly flaps as though preparing hesitantly to fly.But there it is ! OLD MAN keeps trying to fly.Same old soul ! Same old soul ! SENATOR ARMITRAGE Blackout . Lights come up on the living room , where SENATOR ARMITRAGE and the MAN IN ARABIAN HEADDRESS are seated in easy chairs , facing each other . The MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Happy . He takes a big slug from his drink , which has been resting on a coffee table between the two.Well , I guess I live right . Like I was saying Before we got onto dreams , Back in Mad Wolf , That 's the county seat , Back in Mad Wolf . The MAN mumbles something we do not hear.Sure , I can help out you boys . Why , everything above board , Of course , no sleight of hand . One thing you can say about America : it works . Pause.You ever heard of John Sleight ? The MAN mumbles something.Well , look what happened to him . Messed around with the Wrong people . Microchips . A comfortable living , now , that 's All he really wanted Say , what 's her name , the young lady ? The MAN mumbles something . The SENATOR nods . Pause.A man must be careful . The exercise of power demands A kind of muscle . She 's cute So anyhoo John Sleight sets himself up in Old Shintar , among the Patzinaks . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shintar 's the capital , see ? Kinda like the Mad Wolf of Patzinakstan , if you follow . Rose of Isphahan , see ? All that . Microchip plant courtesy of He burps.Intertop . Skilled local population Willing to work hard . Cheap . Not like American labor , nosirreebob ! Work hard . Little itty-bitty chips . John Sleight oversees the local P.R . And operations . Intertop 's man . I was liaison with the director Because the Agency burrowed in there Good . A slew of moles digging up Useful factoids . Anticommunism . To back up the prince , our friend . Intertop and the Agency close on Police matters and management stuff . But it 's about the prince , see ? Our man , but no principles , gosh no . Riots in Shintar , bad . Mind if I go to the head ? In there ? Which one ? Talkative cuss The MAN mumbles something . The SENATOR exits . The GIRL enters and empties the ashtray . After exchanging glances with the MAN , she exits . Pause . The SENATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is subject to fits of daydreamlike musing.You can make yourself into any Damn thing you want to . Whatever It is you want to make yourself Into , you can . People are so much mud Ready to be made into human mud pies . Lost my boot . You seen my boot ? Shit ! The MAN mumbles something.Oh , is that so ? The SENATOR seats himself . Pause.So when All these hellish disorders burst out The prince turned into a royal pumpkin . John Sleight vanished into thin air . Rumor had it he was blowed up . He burps.No fucking way . Musing.Right and wrong and the limits of the American Theater of influence , why it all Do n't mean moose dick . Everybody thought so , though . Me ? I was in the dark , too . Serious dark . Pardon , are those Arab shoes ? You know what happened to John Sleight ? Pause.Beats me But what was I telling you all this for ? I got a mouth like the Mad Wolf River ! The most gosh-darn things Ever , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Intertop . I like being what I am . Helping people . Like you . GIRL brings him another huge drink . Pause . She exits.Ah , what else in the way of , ah , Poontang you got back there ? You do n't drink , I see Musing.Back in Mad Wolf people hung about in knots . Waiting for the returns to come in , loyal . I was the " reform " candidate ! Family do n't speak to me now . Pause.Sometimes I hear this noise , machine noises , like , Like huge pistons and crankshafts , the clanking Of huge wheels and God-awfulest machinery , down There , in the ground . First heard it back in Mad Wolf . The MAN mumbles something.The director ? You know the director . I have this theory about the director , A patriotic American and a loyal Friend of mine going back to the Old days in Mad Wolf . Real estate . You can turn night into day With zoning , he used to say . But roundabout five years ago I began to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . His eyes looked glassy . Like this He demonstrates.And then it got to be so difficult Even to get near the man . I felt for a while I was Being systematically excluded from the Circle of power and resented it bitterly , I did . But I bit the bullet But his eyes was funny , and He creaked . Like this He demonstrates.One day I noticed , we was at A press conference , there were these Little wheels under his shoes And I wondered what in hell , my ! But it was the necktie finally Tipped me off . I was looking at some pictures In my office . Group portraits At christenings , conferences , state Dinners , and such like . And the director ALWAYS HAD ON THE SAME DAMN NECKTIE ! This ratty old black and green rep With a couple of squirts of red , always . You get what I mean ? ALWAYS . He had quite a way with the fair sex . I am reading this book Intimate Pages from the Sex Lives of Rich and Famous Personages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blackbirds wheeling about in the awfulest blue . Bluest I ever You ever . You can do wonders With zoning . So like I say I KEEP MY EAR TO THE GROUND , close To the silent ground swell that is the voice of the Of the people . The only voice they do possess And a damn hard one to hear . Even harder to ignore once it has Collcted its thoughts together and put Those thoughts into comprehensible language Because . Musing.By God . It works at you . Like a foot In a trap . Sometimes I have compared The legislative process to a hay bailer Gone crazy Pause.I saw a fox chew off its own leg once . To get out of a trap . My head hurts . Musing.I have stepped in too many puddles to keep My feet dry . It 's the sky reflected in those rain Puddles . You seem to see through to infinity I like you . I consider you my equal . Without friends , a man is nothing . GIRL brings on another huge drink.I am not nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I need money Badly . Little honey on the side . She 's Got expensive tastes . Furs . Jewelry . Theater . God , how a man needs it . If I got it straight what you want From me is . All above board . Straight . And on the level . You see because I am A public servant . Is . Go to the director . See if the Agency . Can go in there . All on The up and up . Put the screws to those . Goddamn . Fucking . Hottentot . Cocksucker . Reds that did the expropriating , right ? Suggest a trade-off with Intertop . Et cetera . Okay . Fine with me . But the most-favored-nation clause . That 's more difficult . I 'm afraid . For that I 've got to hustle . Ca n't promise you anything . I surely ca n't . Goddamn cocksuckers Got a fucking steam-roller lobbying machine . It 's rough . For that I do n't know . Now seeing as how The generalissimo Your brother wants A microchip plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-made men . Like the generalissimo . A real doer . Back in Mad Wolf When we were kids We used to thumb-fuck Each other . You 'd Ram your thumb up Your own ass , too , Sometimes , when it got Lonely . Pause.Times ago . I 've always gone Pretty much by Myself . I guess . Fought hard for what-Ever it was I believed In at the time . Hard To tell . That little lady of yours , She 's all right , but . Seems almost to Me crazy how like I was born myself . Begot myself . Carried myself Around like a Gosh-darn Watermelon , Then when the time Came round at last Dropped myself . Borned myself into This world . Fully grown . Complete . Perfect . A Whole . Unity , I mean . It 's a sense of my Own destiny I 've Always had . People can tell . They like it . That I 'm this way .

Do n't get me wrong . I am a pro . I used to listen to myself speak . I used to listen to myself speak In front of mirrors . I 'd like to try it with a boy . He lets out with a long moan.Out on the sidewalk , in the rain , Sitting on a wagon , selling pencils . Outside on the sidewalk , in the rain , Wondering what in the name Of heaven has happened to me . Always knew it would come to This . It 's all messed up . No way Ever to make it right again , nope . I knew in my heart it 'd end Like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . A Sense of civic responsibility and Public cleanliness . I always knew Somewhere down in the pit of my belly I 'd end up like this .
