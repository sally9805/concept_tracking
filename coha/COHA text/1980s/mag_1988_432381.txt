@#  | SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN , MAY 4 , 1982 ? The British destroyer H.M.S. Sheffield is on lonely radar picket duty in the choppy waters off the disputed Falkland Islands . Just out of the Sheffield 's radar range , an Argentine Super Etendard fighter swoops down from a cloudcovered sky to launch a French-built Exocet anti-ship missile . The $200,000 hunter-killer screams in six feet above the waves at almost the speed of sound . Eluding the Sheffield 's electronic defenses , the aerial torpedo blasts into the .3100-million destroyer 's hull . Within seconds black , acrid smoke smothers the deck and spirals skyward . The crew fights the raging blaze for five hours , then abandons the wreck . The surprise attack leaves 20 British seamen dead , 24 wounded , and naval planners worldwide scrambling to find an effective and economical countermeasure to lethal sea-skimming missiles . Five years later , U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Robert L. Leuschner sits in a nondescript office building near the Pentagon pondering what may be an answer to the deadly menace : huge high-technology airships designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course , the common reaction is to giggle and say , ' Airships ? You mean blimps ? What a silly idea ! " ' the tall , white-haired , white-clad former carrier skipper tells me . " But what else can stay up in the air with a radar big enough to see these small objects against the ocean clutter ? " he asks , gesturing with an unlit corncob pipe . " Even with an aircraft carrier , we need everything to go just right with the long-endurance aircraft we have now ? E2-C Hawkeyes ? to maintain round-the-clock surveillance patrol . And a non-carrier battle group has little organic intrinsic detection capability against low-flying anti-ship missiles . " The admiral gazes for a moment out of a rain-swept window . " That 's where airships come in , " he continues , again flourishing the pipe . " Instead of hours of endurance , we 're talking weeks " Leuschner 's vision may eventually give a new look to the future Navy . Today , 26 years after its last lighter-thanair craft was decommissioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a return of the battle blimp and the Naval Airship Service . In a cavernous hangar in Weeksville , N.C. , the first prototype gondola is already  | taking shape . The completed blimp , to be called the Sentinel 5000 , will be 423 feet long ? half the length of an aircraft carrier . When its flexible fabric hull is filled with 2.35-million cubic feet of nonflammable helium gas , the new ship will be 60 percent more voluminous than the largest non-rigid airship ever built ? the Goodyear Aerospace Co . ZPG-3W , a 1960s-vintage early-warning radar blimp . The Sentinel 5000 will host a variety of high-tech features ; among them : an advanced vectorable ducted-fan propulsion system for improved low-speed maneuverability ; a pressurized gondola as wide as a 747 's fuselage to keep the crew comfortable during month-long missions ; modern non-metallic materials intended to minimize weight , the chances of detection by enemy radar , and electromagnetic interference ; the latest in " fly-by-light " fiber-optic flight controls instead of heavy wire cables ; a pneumatic actuator system linked by non-metallic air hoses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar dish designed to allow the blimp 's radar system to spot small low-altitude targets more effectively than the powerful radar installed in Boeing E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System ( AWACS ) aircraft . By late 1990 , the big ship will be delivered to the Navy to begin a long series of field trials . If those tests are successful , the Naval Airship Program could lead to an entire armada of 40 or more even-larger missile-spotting guardian blimps . Beyond that , these next-generation  | lighter-than-air craft could herald a new era of civilian passenger and load-hauling vehicles . Even though the Navy disbanded the Naval Airship Service in the early 1960s , it has n't totally ignored airships . " Since 1974 , the Navy has been considering the blimp for various duties , " says David Bailey , manager for lighterthan-air programs at the Naval Air Development Center in Warminster , Pa . " Over the years , we oversaw about forty research studies that analyzed and tested everything from subscale flying models to full-sized leased airships , " he says . As anti-ship missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible advantages of using airships against them became more and more apparent . By the middle of 1986 , Leuschner 's Naval Airship Program had been established , and the Navy had let the world 's aerospace industry know of its new need . Long-time blimp builders , Goodyear Aerospace Co. ( a former unit of The Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. ) and a relative newcomer from Britain , Airships Industries Ltd. ( together with its American partner , Westinghouse Electric Corp. ) , submitted bids . To the surprise of many , Goodyear did not win , despite its long history as the supplier of Navy airships . Goodyear had proposed a highly modernized version of the ZPG-3W airship for the new mission . The winner of the $169-million contract was Westinghouse-Airship Industries , an Anglo-American joint-venture firm based in Baltimore , Md . Airship Industries will build the blimp and Westinghouse Electric will install the radar system . The Sentinel 5000 may not look wildly different from a traditional blimp ? at least not from a distance . But under its skin much will be changed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first really effective control system for airships , " says Roger Munk , technical director for Airship Industries . " It will consist of two tilting propulsor ducts with 14-foot-diameter propellers driven by 1,800-horsepower CRM S.R.L. Milan , Italy marine diesels , and a single uncowled 1,800-horsepower General Electric CT-7 turboprop in a pusher configuration . The directed thrust it provides will allow the Sentinel 5000 to maintain station in a wide range of weather conditions . " " Our Skyships the emerald-green Fuji blimp is one pioneered this type of system , " he says . " With them we were able to demonstrate how you can rotate the ducts upward and power the ship right down to the ground while keeping the craft level . This will be particularly important in the low-speed maneuvering necessary when the naval airship refuels at sea every three or four days . " The real significance of this low-speed maneuvering capability becomes clear when you make a landing approach in a conventional blimp , as I did one summer afternoon last year in the Goodyear Airship Enterprise , with longtime airship pilot Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Harbor , we 're nearing our landing strip when suddenly , the entire cabin tips unsettlingly downward at what seems to be a 45-degree angle , and the ground starts to rush up at the windscreen . If this were a fixed-wing aircraft , I tell myself , we 'd buy the farm for sure . But it 's a blimp , and with a precise turn of the ship 's wheel mounted beside his pilot 's seat , Henry levels off @# @#  | the big ship languidly near the tarmac . Henry explains our unexpected manuever : " A blimp wants to stay where she is . Other than venting expensive lifting gas helium , the only way to get her down is to put her into what 's essentially a controlled , slowmotion crash in which you descend under power , and then pull up when you near the ground . " Power plant Airship Industries ' Munk describes the blimp 's power-plant system further : " The Sentinel 5000 's diesels , which have a high power-to-weight ratio , run efficiently at lower power levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty knots , or nautical miles per hour . The turboprop comes into its own at higher speeds ? eighty knots ? so it will be used in a " sprint " mode ? that is , to put on a burst of speed when it 's required . " A Navy official familiar with the program suggests another use for the so-called sprint turboprop : " It 'll be used to maintain relative position when the airship is matching speed with a ship during refueling operations . With the ducted fans tilted up at 45 degrees so they 're simultaneously driving the blimp forward and maintaining a hover , you 'd put the sprint prop in reverse to hold the airship in position . The combination of downward and opposing thrusts gives the airship better controllability at low speeds . " As yet , " he adds , " it 's still undetermined whether the JP-5 jet fuel will be pumped up to the airship through a hose that 's been winched up by cable or whether it 'll brought up in 150-gallon fuel bladders . Either way , refueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One problem with long-duration airship flights concerns maintaining the equilibrium between the ship 's lift and its weight as fuel and supplies are consumed . Airship Industries engineers are installing a system to recover water from the propulsion engine exhaust so that water ballast can be added during flight . For each pound of fuel that 's burned , the water-recovery system will be able to condense about an ounce of water from the water vapor that 's produced . Though the particular condenser design has not yet been selected , it 's thought that the apparatus will be composed of **25;988;TOOLONG ceramics . All the comforts of home When Pat Henry was in the Navy during the early 1960s , he flew the ZPG-2W , a 365-foot-long Goodyear naval patrol airship . While the ZPG-2W performed its missions well , Henry says , cruising for days hundreds of miles out to sea in the cramped , engine-vibration-and noise-wracked gondola took its toll on the men . " After about thirty-six hours , you became numb , " he says . " You did adjust to the vibration after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's efficiency declined the longer you flew . " Airship Industries ' Munk is aware of this problem . " We need an order-ofmagnitude improvement in the habitability of the crew quarters and working areas beyond that of previous blimps if we 're going to send the crews out on 30-day missions and not have them end up in mental asylums . That 's why the Sentinel 5000 will have a wide-body , multi-deck cabin that 's heavily insulated from engine noise and vibration . In addition , the crew 's compartment will be pressurized , which will also help maintain their efficiency at higher altitudes . " Non-metallic materials To hold down weight , radar reflectance , and electromagnetic interference caused by emissions from the Sentinel 5000 's radar system , nonmetallic composite materials will be used throughout the ship , says Munk . They 'll be used in the gondola ( which is to float in water if ditched , by the way ) , the radar support on its rooftop , the hull nose cone , and the four tail fins . " We 'll be using unidirectional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Munk goes on to ' explain . " They 'll also be some carbon fiber , but we 'd prefer to use none because it 's conductive , which enlarges the blimp 's radar signature and makes it more vulnerable to lightning strikes . " In other subsystems as well , nonmetallic materials will be employed , the Airship Industries technical director notes . " We 've gone with fly-by-light flight controls rather than traditional heavy wire cables or electrical wiring . This means that all signaling between the various avionics components will by sent through glass-fiber optics lines , " says Munk . " Likewise , we 'll use pneumatically powered actuators fed by non-metallic air hoses " rather than electric servomotors to move such items as tail-fin flaps . The gigantic flexible hull itself will be composed of a multi-laminate fabric that will weigh half as much as earlier rubberized materials . On the exterior , there will be a Tedlar aramid weatherproofing layer ; next , a Dacron polyester heavy fabric to bear loads ; and finally , a Mylar plastic film which will serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a special adhesive to form a lightweight , gas-tight , tear-resistant skin . " There will be a number of minor refinements to the aerodynamics of the airship , " Munk notes . " For instance , the Sentinel 5000 will be slightly fatter than traditional airship designs . This gives the blimp envelope better resistance to bending caused by wind gusts but entails no significant drag penalty . In addition , the tail fins are placed slightly farther forward than usual . Traditionally , airship designers figured that the farther forward rear the fins are positioned , the greater lever arm or torque acting around the center of the ship they provide . But we think that this arrangement just bends the bag more , which counteracts any gain you might have gotten . With the fins placed closer to the nose , they extend farther out into cleaner less-turbulentI air , making them more effective in maneuvering the ship . " " The Sentinel 5000 will be fitted with a large classic antenna inside the gas bag so that the system can capture as much power as possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles , " explains a well-placed Navy source who did not want to be identified . " The signals will then be fed to an off-the-shelf radar system similar to the one installed in the E2-C Hawkeye patrol plane . The largeaperture antenna will also allow us to concentrate the beam 's power to a greater extent . The battle group 's enlarged radar horizon ? from 70 to 80 miles with the airship at 5,000 feet ? will greatly increase our reaction time to the approach of missiles . The earlier a ship is alerted , the more time it has to decoy or destroy the missile . Currently , a typical surface vessel can distinguish incoming sea-skimming missiles from about 20 miles away . " Stealth blimps ? Despite the seeming emphasis on radar-transparent non-metallic materials , with its big metal radar dish spinning inside the huge fabric hull , it 's reasonable to believe that Sentinel 5000 will be what one expert called " a gigantic radar target in the sky . " This concerns the Navy less than one might suppose . " We anticipate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Navy official , " so the blimp 's true radar signature is really its radar emissions . This is because radar emissions can be detected by an enemy 's receiver from much farther away than the distance from which he can detect the reflected echoes of his own radar emissions . We do n't think the airship 's passive radar signature is that important . Even if an enemy @#  | nobody really knows where that transition threshold is , " the admiral concludes . Norman Mayer , airship engineer formerly with Goodyear-Zeppelin and the Navy , who is consulting for his old service on the program , says this about a size limit of blimps : " The technical limit to a blimp 's size has to do with the strength of the envelope fabric and its seams . I 'd say that the size limit falls somewhere between twice the size of present airships and the size of the Hindenberg 1803 feet in length and over 7 million cubic feet in volume . " Modern rigid-envelope airships are not merely the pipe dream of some wild-eyed airship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared a proposal to build an unusual type of rigid airship ( see photo ) . The Boeing Airship design features a rigid advanced-composite frame to which a composite skin is attached . Unlike traditional rigid airships in which the outside envelope is a mere covering , the skin of the new design ( called by some a rigid blimp ' ) carries the shear loads for the structure . Civilian airships " The Naval Airship Program may serve as a spur to civilian airship use because it would provide an industrial base , " Mayer says . " One possibility is using large airships for remote logging and other heavy-lift hauling operations . These applications look attractive if you can get a reliable vehicle , " he comments . " Several small firms are studying this application , especially in Canada . " Mayer recently completed a study project for Resorts International , a gambling casino in Atlantic City , N.J. , to evaluate the possibility of using blimps to shuttle gamblers back and forth from New York City . " Resorts wanted a 200-passenger blimp , but of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . The company actually purchased a Skyship 600 blimp from Airship Industries for tests ( as well as advertising ) , but financial problems halted any further efforts . It 's estimated that a Sentinel 5000 converted to a passenger configuration would be able to carry from 120 to 200 people , depending on the range . We 've long been fascinated by these huge , yet insubstantial craft that float so serenely in the air , but for years the airship seemed to be a curious aerial anachronism just waiting to die off . Now the stately and venerable airship may regain some special niches in a sky crisscrossed by supersonic aircraft . If you like to build things , NRI can show you how to make money . building homes .
