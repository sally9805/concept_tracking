txt Squawks about the new federal budget are already rising from the nation 's mayors and governors . They know ? sight unseen , that the biggest target for spending cuts is bound to be their . aid from Uncle Sam . Even without a program of " New Federalism , " budget discipline that exempts Social Security and the Defense Department translates into drastic reductions in the programs that feed into state and local budgets . So the National League of Cities , for instance , is warning that its members face a " bleak " financial outlook . The NLC staff made this prediction in releasing a survey showing that of 79 cities , 90% would not spend their own money to make up planned federal cuts in community and urban development grants . The city lobbyists also note that this is the first recession since the 1940s which has not been buffered by growth in municipal employment . Before we shed too many tears , however , it 's worth noting a point which the NLC left out . This group traditionally has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations toward the benefits of federal aid . When it implies , along with so many others , that federal cutbacks will inevitably force state and local governments to raise taxes , it ignores recent studies suggesting that grants from Washington have increased , not reduced , the costs of state and local government . In a recent paper circulated by the Heritage Foundation , for instance , Clemson University economist Richard B. reports that states and localities with above average levels of federal support also impose higher than average tax burdens . A few years ago , similarly , Dartmouth College economist Colin Campbell studied the rising tax burdens in Vermont , Massachusetts and New Hampshire . He found that the first two states paid higher taxes in part because they relied much more heavily than New Hampshire on federal grants in aid . His explanation was that " units of government are more efficient when they have to rely on their own sources of revenue . " There are other ways to account for this paradox as well . A majority of federal grants require matching funds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes leaving them holding the bag when the federal programs expire ) . The federal government has used this leverage to demand more services from local governments . Probably the most important effect of federal money , though , has been to wipe out the natural discipline on spending imposed by competition among state and local governments . Before the New Deal , it was the conventional wisdom among states that too great an increase in public spending would send business and taxpayers fleeing across the border to lower taxes . So those who wanted an expanded public sector turned to the federal government , which collected taxes everywhere , to provide the money . But when the manna floated down from Washington , the local politicians did n't have to worry whether they were getting the best use out of their budgets . The pervasive belief that government is wasting money on an unprecedented scale shows up clearly in the opinion polls , not to mention the tax revolt . An unsung feature of the administration 's New Federalism is that it should reduce the size not only of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What this might mean for the economy can be seen from comparing New Hampshire to its neighbors . For the last decade , it has led New England and much of the entire East Coast in its proportional growth in jobs and population . This record is still holding up , even in the face of declining tax burdens , and dramatic economic turn-arounds , in neighboring Vermont and Massachusetts . So it does n't alarm us to hear that municipal employment is declining or that state and local spending is n't swelling to fill the cutbacks in federal aid . We of course admit there is ample pain in making this transition during a recession ; the social demands of the downturn compound the difficulty of winding down spending , a hard enough task in good times . Ultimately , though , the decline in federal aid will leave behind lean , efficient and more responsive state and local governments . The taxpayers will appreciate it , even if mayors and governors don't.                 @ @ @ @
