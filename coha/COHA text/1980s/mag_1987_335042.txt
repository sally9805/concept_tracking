When Oliver North wanted to get something done quickly , secretly and with a minimum of fuss , he called his friend Richard Secord . In November 1985 Secord came to the rescue of frazzled White House officials by deftly diverting a plane that was scheduled for a weapons shipment to the contras to help transport arms to Iran . As North later wrote admiringly to Admiral John Poindexter , " Why Dick can do something in five minutes that the CIA can not do in two days is beyond me  --  but he does . " Another time North wrote , " a man of many talents ol ' Secord is . " <P> Wherever the complicated trail of the Iran-contra affair leads , it seems at some point to intersect with retired Air Force Major General Richard V. Secord . The blunt , no-nonsense West Point graduate has remained aloof and silent since the scandal broke last November . But beginning Tuesday , when he appears as the joint congressional committee 's opening witness , the mysterious Secord may become a household name and perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Secord had a bird's-eye view of the entire affair . As president of a company selling arms around the world , the retired two-star general provided aircraft and crews to ship weapons to Iran , accompanied former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane on his secret mission to Tehran , purchased **25;9023;TOOLONG aircraft for the contras and was in charge of coordinating munitions drops for the rebels . <P> All of this was nothing new for Secord . In his three decades of military service , he was involved in clandestine operations wherever things were hottest around the world . After seeing action as a fighter pilot in Viet Nam , he was attached to a CIA force in Thailand to supervise flights for the agency 's secret Laotian war . In 1975 he was stationed as a military attache in Iran and helped guide the Shah in spending billions of dollars on a 500-plane air force . In Tehran , he met his future partner Albert Hakim , who was then engineering the sale of sophisticated electronic equipment to the Shah 's secret police . <P> Secord returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance and sales program . There he formed a relationship with Edwin Wilson , the CIA operative turned arms merchant now serving 52 years in federal prison for illegally selling arms to Libya . Secord 's career stalled in 1982 , when he came under investigation by a federal grand jury for allegedly conspiring with Wilson and others to defraud the U.S. Government of $8 million on an Egyptian arms-shipping contract . He was suspended from duty for a short time , although he was never indicted ; he was reinstated with the approval of then Deputy Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci , now the National Security Adviser . He left the Air Force the following year to become president of Hakim 's Stanford Technology Corp . <P> Friends say Secord has been itching to tell his story , but did not decide to do so until he was allowed by the congressional committee to inspect secret bank records , controlled by Hakim , which convinced him that he had no legal culpability . House Chairman Lee Hamilton is certain that Secord 's testimony will go right to the heart of Iranscam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton . " There are n't many of them in this drama . Most of the witnesses who will follow him will fill in the gaps . "
