A TIME poll shows more losses than gains for the other candidates <P> The camps of the underdog candidates have long argued that if people only knew more about their men , Walter Mondale 's lead would dwindle . Not so , according to a poll done for TIME by Yankelovich , Skelly &; White , Inc. * Between December and February , the number of undecided Democratic and independent voters declined from 26% to 14% . Those who said they would vote for Mondale increased from 34% to 50% , while no other candidate gained more than 1 point . <P> Asked whether Mondale would make an " acceptable " President , 80% of Democrats said yes . Of the other candidates , only Jesse Jackson showed an impressive increase in acceptability , probably attributable to freeing Naval Aviator Robert Goodman from Syria . But half of the Democrats still find Jackson unacceptable . <P> For the rest , to know them is apparently to dislike them . Only 15% of Democratic voters now say they are unfamiliar with John Glenn , down from 28% in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , while the percentage who found him unacceptable doubled . Most voters said no when asked if Glenn was a " dynamic and exciting candidate " or had " the land of experience he needs to do a good job . " Similarly , Democratic voters familiar with Gary Hart rose from 37% to 44% between September and February , yet his acceptability as a candidate did not increase , and his disapproval rating jumped sharply . <P> A majority ( 57% ) think that Mondale has locked up the Democratic nomination . Only about one-third attribute Mondale 's lead purely to personal popularity . An equal number cited his strong campaign organization and his support from party leaders and interest groups . Mondale 's wide name recognition serves him well : while 74% said they were " aware " that he is a candidate , only 59% were able to name Glenn without prompting , and only 15% could name Hart . <P> Mondale may be trouncing his Democratic opponents , but he trails President Reagan 51% to 41% among all voters . Reagan manages to siphon off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Mondale by 62% to 26% . <P> There is increasing evidence that the gender gap is real ; the President does not draw as well among women as he does among men . While he enjoys a 68% favorable rating among men , the figure for women is 55% . Among Republicans , Reagan is just as popular with women as with men ( 87% ) , but there is a gap of 16 points ( 52% vs. 36% ) between Democratic men and women . When asked their objections to Reagan , more women ( 53% ) give his opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment than any other reason . Fear that he will lead the country into war comes second ( 46% ) . <P> Among the population as a whole , Reagan is riding a wave of good feeling . More people ( 68% ) say things are going well in the country than in any other period since 1977 . At the same time , however , only 36% say they have a " lot " of confidence in future prosperity . Interestingly , the percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 6% to 14% . The only consolation for Reagan is that voters are even less sanguine about the Democrats ' ability to cut the $183.7 billion deficit .
