The new provisional Government abolished a requirement that all typewriters be registered with the state , and legalized abortion , an offense for which violators were jailed . And under a decree published today , Rumanian citizens are freed of the obligation to address each other as " comrade. " // But even as calm descended on the capital after five nights of gunfire , the Government invoked " revolutionary " conditions as it instituted special military tribunals to track down , try and punish armed Ceausescu supporters . <> <> Caution Returns at Night // Although Bucharest was quiet tonight , pedestrians picked their way home cautiously , accustomed to the frequent and random sniper shots of recent days. // But during the day , crowds strolled leisurely past the hull of the burned-out national library on Palace Square , and past the offices of the Communist Party ' s Central Committee , scene of fierce fighting over the weekend , to look at the tanks parked there. // In the subways , self-appointed youths checking people ' s documents and searching for weapons have set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the renegade security forces of Mr. Ceausescu seemed to lessen . Today , for the first time , there were no spontaneous demonstrations in the center of the city of the kind that have filled the streets here since the ouster of Mr. Ceausescu last Friday . <> <> Scenes of Trial and Death // The Government-controlled television tonight again showed tapes of the former ruler ' s trial on Christmas Day , during which he angrily dismissed the charges against him and vowed to take his case to the " working class. " // Today , for the first time , a full view of the body of Elena Ceausescu , the President ' s wife , was shown on television . Both she and her husband were laid out on army cots , their bloody coats loosely draped around them. // Workers at Free Rumanian Television said today that the tape of the Ceausescu trial , first shown in still pictures on Monday night , had to be edited to delete the faces of the judges because of their fears of retaliation by Ceausescu loyalists . A Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place. // A witness to the executions , who asked not to be identified , said in an interview that soldiers in the firing squad " could not restrain their hate " and " fired immediately , with abandon. " // There have been widely varying estimates of the number of people killed in the years that Mr. Ceausescu was in power , with the tribunal that condemned him to death hearing a figure of 60 , 000 . However , specifics and dates of the killings remain elusive . There seems general agreement that thousands have died , many of them since the revolution began in the western city of Timisoara almost two weeks ago. // These days , some Rumanians are troubled by the heavily propagandistic character of the television and the newspapers under the countrol of the Council of National Salvation , the formal name for the revolutionary leadership . They are carrying Government decrees and exhortatory articles with little commentary , investigative reports or analysis , leading some to question whether the new council is abusing its control over the media. // Also , they note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country - have not yet been clarified . Debates on these and other issues among the 37 members of the ruling council are not publicized , and some groups , particularly students , are demanding more openness at the top. // With the Communist Party in tatters after the collapse of the Ceausescu leadership in this month ' s uprising , the role to be played by former Communists in the new Government has become an important issue. // Students and dissident intellectuals have expressed dissatisfaction at the appointment of several onetime Communist officials , including the President , Ion Iliescu , a former Cabinet minister and party secretary , to top jobs in the Government . Mr. Iliescu spoke by telephone today with the Soviet President , Mikhail S. Gorbachev , and thanked him for backing the revolution , the press agency Tass reported from Moscow. // Mr. Iliescu and Mr. Gorbachev reportedly are friends from their college days in Moscow. // And the new Vice President , Dumitru Mazilu , told reporters that people with a record of collaboration with the Ceausescu regime would have no role in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Such people who are not clean , we will not work with them , " said Mr. Mazilu , a former diplomat who was placed under house arrest after he criticized Rumania ' s human rights record . " We have a plan for a new Government , with new people. " // However , the problem is a delicate one in a country where four million people are past or present members of the Communist Party . Rumanians and Western diplomats agree that the new Government will have to draw on the pool of former Communist bureaucrats to keep things running. // And today , at a news conference , a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry ruled out any kind of a witch hunt in the bureaucracy . " We believe we will have to proceed very carefully , " said Corneliu Bogdan , a new Cabinet minister . " There are some people who expressed their views and suffered , and some complied . We have to remember that not everyone can be a hero. " // " The first question will be competence , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who in recent years had been regarded as a dissident . He added that it is inaccurate to describe new political parties springing up as anti-Government . " There can be no opposition party because there is no party in government , " Mr. Bogdan said . <> <> No Confusion at the Top // The council , he said , is made up of a " remarkable consensus , one of the great unique features of the Rumanian revolution . " He denied that there was any confusion in the new Government , which will serve until elections in April. // " We have a program , but we need tranquillity , " he said. // From its makeshift headquarters at the Foreign Ministry , the Government has been issuing a stream of decrees this week . The army has been put in charge of the Securitate , the security force many of whose members remained loyal to Mr. Ceausescu .

The law , drawn to promote population growth in this country of 23 million , was hated by most women here , some of whom resorted to dangerous self-induced abortions . Because the law also penalized doctors who treated women who had performed abortions on themselves , hospitals often turned away patients or treated them under a different guise. // " It was the most horrible law , " a young Rumanian woman said . " Even pregnant women did not want to be checked , which meant a lot of people who needed care were frightened to get it . " Abortion is a primary means of birth control throughout Eastern Europe. // Also halted was a hated modernization program that had razed villages and destroyed old buildings in Rumania .

Food saved for export will be used at home. // And today in Bucharest , crates with Cyrillic lettering filled with chickens headed for the Soviet Union showed up at local stores , along with oranges and lemons. // Rationing was immediately lifted after Mr. Ceausescu ' s ouster last Friday , and Rumanians did not wait for instructions to turn up the heat in their apartments , celebrating the end of a painful austerity program. // Today , the Government announced " emergency measures to strike at the lingering threat from members of the Securitate , who until Tuesday were waging urban guerrilla warfare against the army. //
