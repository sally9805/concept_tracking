The Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River , once navigable , now has a single abstract function : Kentucky lies on one side , West Virginia on the other . Splayed out from both banks are noiseless hollows and stubbly , once-farmed bottoms , all in the shadow of Appalachian mountains , which rise dark and gorgeous in every direction . But to the businessmen who brought the railroad through around 1900 , wooded slopes and crags were incidental : the capitalists came to burrow and cart away endless tons of coal , which they 're still doing today . The Tug Fork Valley , boosters chime , is THE HEART OF THE BILLION DOLLAR COAL FIELD . But hidden behind that bluff , commercial slogan is a different kind of past-peculiar and unsavory and murderous . This valley is the home turf of the Hatfields and the McCoys , whose family war a century ago became freakish folk legend , even as it was being fought . <P> Hatfields and McCoys are still here , hundreds of them , Hatfields clustered around West Virginia towns like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamboree in Kentucky . Many still hunt ( raccoons , squirrels ) and gather ( chestnuts , huckleberries ) , but they also watch cable TV and vacation in New Jersey . The feud is unequivocally over . All is forgiven . Forgotten ? Not just yet . " Why , we 're plain old Hatfields and McCoys , " says one of the latter in a shrugging , boiler-plate disclaimer , " good friends and neighbors . . . " Yet after a reminiscence has meandered a while , and the truce reaffirmed again , the rote kindliness can give way to neat bursts of partisanship . In bits and pieces , a little blame is assigned , victory claimed . The legacy is not erased , just quiet and manageable . Modern Hatfields and McCoys do not quite know whether to be proud or embarrassed by their inglorious family histories , and most are a little of both . That modest ambivalence , coming from direct descendants of roughneck killers , is almost sweet . <P> Exactly what made the clans so extravagantly unfriendly is open to conjecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a razorback hog . Maybe he was angry at his daughter Rose Anne , pregnant by Johnse Hatfield after a frolic in 1880 , for moving , unmarried , into the Hatfield compound . Or maybe the cause was the packs of Hatfields who crossed the Tug Fork and went swaggering around the Kentucky election grounds . Whatever the reason , the furies were unambiguously loosed on a whisky-sodden day 100 years ago next August . One of McCoy 's sons taunted an unarmed Ellison Hatfield , and Ellison 's riposte was intemperate and unprintable . Seventeen knife thrusts and one revolver shot later , Ellison lay mortally wounded . The **25;9730;TOOLONG retaliation began : three McCoys were captured by Hatfields under the command of Ellison 's brother Devil Anse , tied to a pawpaw bush , and shot to death . The skirmishing ended with the century , after at least 20 ( and perhaps 100 ) men and women had died . <P> The feudists were prolific in all things . Devil Anse , like his McCoy counterpart , fathered 13 children ; his brother Valentine is reputed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
