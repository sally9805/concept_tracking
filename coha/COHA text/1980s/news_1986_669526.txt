For one thing , the curly-haired , jeans-clad Baumann is a loyal communist . For another , he refuses to write the violent bam-bam , shoot- ' em-up computer games so popular in the United States . Instead , he insists on inventing nice , sweet , peaceful diversions. // // ' ' We don ' t grow up with violence in the air like in the West , ' ' says Mr. Baumann . ' ' Since we don ' t have violence on television , violence on the streets , our fantasy world doesn ' t revolve around violence. ' ' // Dismiss that as communist propaganda , if you like . Don ' t dismiss Baumann ' s success , however . His Novotrade Inc. software company earned a 36 million forint ( about $1 million ) profit last year selling computer programs , mostly computer games . Novotrade is the first communist enterprise to export computer software to the West . It has helped to put Hungary at the head of Eastern Europe in developing a domestic computer software indusry. // Communist Europe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume . Like Hungary , other Eastern European countries are accelerating their computerization . The Soviet Union and East Germany produce their own main-frame computers . Along with Poland and Hungary , both also are importing thousands of personal computers from the West and have launched large-scale computer-literacy programs in schools. // ' ' The level of computerization here is leaping forward , ' ' explains Judit Weisz , director of the largest Hungarian computer firm , Szamalk . ' ' While we are far from Western levels , we are fast obtaining the level needed for a middle-level industrial country. ' ' // Admittedly , reaching that level poses problems . Despite efforts at producing computers domestically , most East-bloc countries are becoming dependent on Western imports of computer hardware which eat up scarce hard currency. // ' ' We can ' t use East-bloc computers , ' ' complains Istvan Veto , Novotrade ' s administrative manager . ' ' They aren ' t dependable enough. ' ' // Computerization poses political problems as well . Many communist parties fear the consequences of a free flow of information which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland , for example , authorities are worried that the opposition has obtained word processors to print out samizdat ( self-published ) material. // Of all the East-bloc countries , relatively liberal Hungary has best managed to overcome these difficulties . More than elsewhere , its authorities are prepared to accept the political risks of a freer flow of information . They know that Hungary will not be able to shrug off dependence on Western hardware . Instead , Dr. Weisz and Mr. Veto say the goal of Hungarian computer planners is to take the lead in designing software. // Human intelligence is the key to writing high-quality software , not fancy machinery , and in this area , the Hungarians figure they will have no problem . The country has a long , distinguished history of producing creative mathematicians . The inventer of the modern computer was a Hungarian expatriate , John Van Neumann . So was the creator of the famous Rubik ' s cube. // ' ' The Hungarians get a good mathematical base in school , ' ' says Sharon Cooper of the London-based Andromeda , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That helps them in programming. ' ' // Adversity also might have helped the Hungarians . During the 1960s , the West forbade computer exports to Eastern Europe . Fledgling communist programmers had to rely on smuggled material . ' ' They had to program and do the maintenance ( of the computers ) , ' ' explains Mr. Veto . ' ' That gave them a more thorough knowlege of the machines than Western programmers. ' ' // This knowlege was put to use in the early 1980s . By this time , the Western ban on computer exports had ended and Hungarian authorities began encouraging individuals to own their own computer and to use them for private gain . Want to earn a little extra cash ? , the authorities asked . Then program computers after hours. // Today , most of Hungary ' s 40 , 000 programmers are moonlighters . Of Novotrade ' s 150 programmers , for example , Veto says all but six are freelancers who write programs as a second job . By Hungarian standards , the programmers earn a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , part of which can be earned in hard currency. // ' ' They can ' t buy Mercedes , ' ' Veto says . ' ' But they can get a Western television or video machine. ' ' // To earn these goodies , the programmers concentrate on exports to the West . Szamalk is proud to have sold a data-modeling system to IBM recently . The biggest-selling Hungarian exports remain computer games , which can be easily produced at home on the cheap Commodore 64 computers that dominate the Hungarian market. // A preference for nonviolent games also helps . The Hungarians have found a niche with their sweeter , creative games . For youngsters , the focus is on folk tales . For example , Baumann now is working on a game that asks children to create a fairy-tale playground . In another game called ' ' Save Me , Brave Knight , ' ' the heroic knight takes on evil dragons . Instead of slaying them , though , the dragons fade from the screen when they are defeated. // Just as often , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two hot Hungarian sellers in Western Europe and the United States are called ' ' Chess ' ' and ' ' Scarabas. ' ' // ' ' Chess ' ' is drawn from the distinguished Hungarian chess-playing tradition ; it consists of 88 chess games of former world champions . ' ' Scarabus ' ' is a type of adventure game based on ' ' Raiders of the Lost Ark. ' ' // ' ' Instead of asking the player to zap the zombie as in a Western game , Scarabus is a strategic game , ' ' explains Baumann , who wrote the program. // ' ' It focuses on the psychological motives of the characters and asks the player to deduce the best way of finding the treasure. ' ' // The Hungarians aren ' t complete goody-goodies . Novotrade ' s programmers tended to be middle-aged at first , explains Andromeda ' s Cooper , adding that their games naturally tended to be nonviolent . Now , as younger people such as Baumann have taken up the job , the Andromeda people say the games are becoming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a shoot-them-up adventure game , ' ' Cooper says. // //
