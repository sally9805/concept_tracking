After 54 years , a classic is triumphantly restored <P> On April 7 , 1927 , Charles de Gaulle and his friend , Andr Malraux , saw the Paris premiere of a new movie . At its end , the two great-men-to-be were on their feet , cheering . Malraux remembered De Gaulle waving his long arms and crying , " Bravo , magnifique ! " It is said that De Gaulle never forgot the images of glory he found that evening in Abel Gance 's epic reconstruction of another young soldier 's climb to greatness , Napoleon . <P> Unfortunately , another movie captivated audiences that year : The Jazz Singer . The first talkie totally obscured the late , great silents like Napoleon . The Gance film was also dauntingly long . Though De Gaulle saw a 2-hour version , the movie Gance originally intended to release was something like six hours in length . <P> Though various cuts of the film circulated through the years , it was not until last week , in Manhattan 's Radio City Music Hall , that the public got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as definitive . Close to 4 hours in length , it is a reconstitution by Kevin Brownlow , a talented English film historian ( The Parade 's Gone By , Hollywood : the Pioneers ) , who spent a decade painstakingly collecting bits and pieces of film . It is appropriate , perhaps inevitable , that Brownlow 's work should be presented by Francis Ford Coppola ( The Godfather , Apocalypse Now ) , a modern inheritor of the epic tradition . He has brought a showman 's flair to the project , commissioning a score from his composer father , Carmine , who led the American Symphony at last weekend 's premiere . It is-as silent film scores always were-full of quotations from the masters and plenty of bombast . ( After a few more special evenings in major cities , the film will go into general release . ) Anyone interested in the history of the cinema will want to see Napoleon . Even those less devoted to film , or less concerned than Gance was with French national mythology , will find plenty to beguile and dazzle them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this any more . <P> The most vivid element in Brownlow 's reconstruction is a concluding 18-minute triptych in which three well-synchronized images are simultaneously projected on a suddenly expanded screen , as Napoleon is preparing to lead his army into Italy and the campaign that made him a world figure . By another name , this is Cinerama , though it is 30 years ahead of that gimmick 's invention . It is also crudely stirring , and just about as big a finish as any movie has ever had . <P> This episode alone is not what makes Napoleon memorable . That quality derives from its shooting and editing . D.W.Griffith demonstrated the limitless scope of the screen 's ability to tackle big scenes in Intolerance ( 1916 ) . Eisenstein , in pictures like Battleship Potemkin ( 1925 ) , showed how the juxtaposition of disparate images could create , through montage , meanings that were more felt than consciously understood . Gance 's great contribution was to set the camera free of the tripod , making it a participant in , as well as an observer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
