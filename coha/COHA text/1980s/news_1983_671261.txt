It was the Northern Pacific that tied the minerals , lumber and cattle of the Northwest to the money and markets of the East , that carried thousands of land-starved immigrants into this part of the West and that ultimately brought Idaho , Montana and the Dakotas into the union. // " It is the railroad that built the Northwest , " said Charles Holliday , the main organizer of the celebration on a stretch of unused track that runs through the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site. // Or , as the Governor of the Montana Territory , John Schuyler Crosby , declared at ceremonies 100 years ago , " An empire has been brought out of the savage wilderness and introduced to the great sisterhood of the civilized states ! " <> <> Re-enactment of Ceremony The speeches , full of bombast and manifest destiny , are being repeated in abridged form this week along with a re-enactment of the driving of the last spike , which , in a show then of technological savvy , was wired to a telegraph . As each hammer blow fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portentous " dot " to terminals up and down the line. // A hissing , clanking 1861 Cooke steam locomotive has been brought in for flavor to stand on the track next to the top-hatted and bearded impersonators of the famous guests at the original driving of the last spike. // They and the tourists whoop and cheer each glowing promise of the untroubled future , the " cattle , mines and timber on which this whole country will come to depend , " and the railroad baron ' s promise to " soon bring in nine million people who can not be called local in nature . " And they hear tales of the hardship and mishap in linking Lake Superior and Puget Sound with 2 , 045 miles of steel. // " No light duty it was , " declared the stand-in for Henry Villard of New York , president of the railroad , " but grave and worrisome , and nerve-enduring . " <> <> The New and the Old // A hundred yards away and on its own track , like a chaperone overseeing all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motors SD-45 diesel electric locomotive of Burlington Northern Inc. , the corporate amalgam that resulted from the merger of the Northern Pacific with a handful of other lines in 1970. // The big , efficient locomotive , as cold and stark as the old steam engine was extroverted and gay , provided an apt juxtaposition for some of the onlookers between the past glories of the Western rails and the hard efficiencies of today ' s carriers. // For 100 years after the success of the Northern Pacific , heated arguments continue over the rates and service that the Burlington , all but a monopoly in the state today , chooses to provide. // Those arguments , in turn , are related to the tough economic times that Montana has encountered in the current recession . For years , the state ' s economy surged ahead of the rest of the country ' s as its wheat and cattle and timber rode the rails to market as promised , along with its coal , copper and petroleum products . <> <> State Hurt by Recession // But when the Northern Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also tied the state to the rest of the country ' s problems. // " Contrary to all previous recessions , the recession here was much more severe than the national recession , much more , " said Phillip D. Brooks , senior economist with the Montana Department of Commerce . " And many of the reasons lie outside the state. " // The low price of copper is forcing mines to close , and coal is in a slump along with the timber market . Early harvests because of the drought have sharpened an already severe shortage of grain cars on the Burlington line that has some farmers dumping their grain on the ground. // Montanans have suffered a 12 percent drop in real earnings since 1979 and unemployment stands at a stubborn 8. 2 percent . And while many underlying causes of the slump lie in distant mines and markets , the Burlington Northern is being criticized , too , both for providing too little or no service on many old spurs and for charging too much for the work it does . <> <> Government Action Sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged Government action to force changes on the railroad , and Lester Thurow , an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , has accused the Burlington of acting as a brake on the Montana economy. // Mr. Brooks , the state economist , is circumspectly blunt about the line : " They have a virtual monopoly in Montana and most monopolies tend to exploit that power , " he said . " I wouldn ' t say that the Burlington Northern is necessarily exploiting their power , but as an economist I understand the power of monopolies , along with the old adage that power corrupts. " // The railroad defends its service and tariff actions as the necessary results of efficient operation , especially under the recent deregulation of rail carriers , and argues that keeping old lines and services open would require fees beyond anything its customers would be willing to pay. // Many of today ' s arguments about railroads are reminiscent of similar disputes a century ago , when farmers complained about freight charges and anti-monopolists criticized the grants of Federal land that were made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land to the Northern Pacific. // " Although there are many who have blame for this action , " the centennial ' s Henry Villard echoed the real one of a 100 years ago , " many others consider it a positive blessing. " // Much of the land was indeed sold to finance the railroad ; bought by settlers who tilled the soil and fattened their herds on the bluebunch wheatgrass and Great Basin wild rye that carpeted the glacial valleys. // The railroad retained the mineral rights on all the land it sold , however , and today Burlington Northern is one of the biggest owners of coal , oil and gas rights in the region . That upsets , among others , Warren R. McGee of Livingston , a retired 40-year man on the old Northern Pacific and the state ' s premier train buff. // " Their charter gave them 47 million acres , the equivalent of the six New England states , ' to secure the safe and speedy transportation of the mails , troops , munitions of war and public stores , ' " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervor of a steam locomotive pulling freight through the Bozeman Pass. // " But that ' s not what they ' re in business for now , " he went on . " Now the BN is going to go into the land business and the coal business and the oil business and to hell with the railroad , which all the smart people think are passe anyway , don ' t they ?
