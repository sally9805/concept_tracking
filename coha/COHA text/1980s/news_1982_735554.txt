txt In a recent White House meeting . U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Paul Thayer was advising senior administration officials on areas where the federal budget could be reduced . President Reagan was on hand for a time , and after he left for another appointment , Mr. Thayer began to talk about the need for cuts in defense spending . As a White House aide recalls it , Chief of Staff James Baker impatiently cut Mr. Thayer off saying . " You should have been making those arguments three minutes ago , " when the president was still present . Mr. Baker is said to have added , " I do n't even want to hear it now . " The episode tells much about defensespending attitudes . Mr. Thayer is hardly a dove ; he was the chairman of LTV Corp. , a major defense contractor , and has since become Mr. Reagan 's deputy defense secretary . And Mr. Baker , a wealthy Republican lawyer from Houston . is n't a flaming liberal . Among business leaders , in public opinion polls , in Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Reagan 's ambitious military buildup is too costly and should be cut back sharply . A Majority of Two But such reversal does n't seem to be in the cards . By all accounts , Mr. Reagan and his longtime adviser , Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , are bent on constituting a majority of two to keep largely intact their $1.6 trillion five-year military spending plan . And the betting is that they will succeed . Experts say that if Mr. Reagan and Mr. Weinberger can just hold on during 1983 , despite the political pressures caused by rising deficits and joblessness , it will be too late for their critics to do much more than wring their hands about Pentagon spending . For 1983 is the year of decision for the Reagan defense program . Without substantial changes in the fiscal-1984 budget due next month , the experts say , weapons-buying plans will be locked in for most of this decade . That future cost is just what worries some in Congress . " I think we 're going to have to have some actual program cuts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Nunn of Georgia , an influential defense thinker . He and others worry that the costly weapons programs begun today will demand expenditures for years to come , and that there might not be the dollars in future years to pay for them . " We 're going to have severe underfunding problems when the bills come due in 1985 , 1986 and beyond , " he says . Revised Approach Even the staunchest backers of the arms buildup do n't think their budget can get through unscathed next year . Hence , the administration is looking for ways to put the best face possible on its budget request : A team of Pentagon officials and White House staffers has been trying to refigure the fiscal-1984 request using lower inflation estimates and other changed assumptions , so the president can ask for less money to buy the same weapons . As the recent House vote against production funds for the MX missile shows , Congress can still hand the president sizable setbacks . But history shows that once big weapons programs get rolling  --  generating jobs and business contracts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general scope and outline of the arms buildup are all but set , and 1983 is the year for many of Mr. Reagan 's major projects to pick up steam . Since the president took office in January 1981 , he has jacked up Pentagon spending authority in each year 's budget proposal . So far the actual outlays have risen far more slowly , reflecting the lag of several years before production of a new weapons system kicks into high gear . But if the president sticks to his plan for fiscal 1984 , he will present a budget calling for the fattest rise yet in actual military outlays . They would climb about $39 billion , or 19% , from this fiscal year 's expected $208 billion . Ballooning Deficit Meanwhile , the federal budget deficit is ballooning to levels that set teeth rattling in Washington and on Wall Street . The expected fiscal-1983 deficit of about $185 billion would be by far the largest in U.S. history , and administration officials have said the fiscal-1984 deficit will top $180 billion without new action to reduce it . Deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates upward again and retard for years the economic growth needed to reduce unemployment . The result is that even conservative Republicans are having qualms about the size of the president 's defense program . Republican Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana recently warned Secretary Weinberger of " a definite perception in the public that the Pentagon and military spending are simply out of control . " " I was elected with your boss by a strong pro-defense constituency , " he added , " but my mail has gone 180 degrees in the opposite direction " lately . Publicopinion polls are equally striking . A recent survey for Business Week magazine showed public backing for continued military increases had plunged from 71% during the 1980 election campaign to 17% this fall . Mr. Reagan obviously does n't see things that way . " To have your eye on the deficit with regard to defense , " he recently told Time magazine , " is to ignore , as some predecessors have , that the primary objective of government must be the protection of the liberties of our people . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a budgetary solution . " That firmly held conviction , echoed by Mr. Weinberger in speeches and press conferences , has snuffed out most active opposition to the size of the defense buildup within the administration itself . Last year . Chief of Staff Baker and Budget Director David Stockman mounted an intensive campaign to get Mr. Reagan to make significant cuts in his buildup . But Mr. Weinberger won out , arguing that U.S. military might had dangerously diminished and that only a strong defense posture would persuade the Soviet Union to undertake serious arms-control efforts . A few months ago . the president again sided with the secretary and against many of his other aides by renouncing the 1984 and 1985 portions of a budget deal worked out with Congress . The deal would have reduced the defense buildup by more than $20 billion over the two years . This time around , the White House aides have n't pressed the case . After their fruitless efforts , Messrs . Baker and Stockman seem to lack the appetite for another major go-round . Moreover , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disloyalty or of trying to manipulate their boss . " There has been a conscious effort to avoid the appearance ? or the reality  --  of ganging up on the president , " a senior White House official says . Aides say Mr. Reagan will probably review the defense budget one more time before it is packed off to the printer . Relatively unbloodied advisers like Martin Feldstein , the new Council of Economic Advisers chairman , may press the issue then . But no one is predicting success . A top official who has known Mr. Reagan for years says there wo n't be much change " primarily because the president 's already made the basic decision on the buildup and he is n't going to back off of it . " Signals to the Soviets The recent leadership change in the Soviet Union , aides suggest , makes him even more determined . Mr. Weinberger and other hard-liners are telling him that any significant spending cuts or major weapons cancellations would send out what one calls " dreamy signals about unilateral disarmament over here . " Advocates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential allies , including Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and Secretary-of State George Shultz . ? So far , though , neither man has taken up the challenge . A senior White House aide goes so far as to say that Mr. Shultz buttresses Mr. Weinberger in his arguments to the president . White House aides say there are political as well as philosophical reasons for Mr. Reagan 's stubbornness on the arms budget . The president , they say , knows that Congress will try to scale back his request , and he does n't want to open the door even a crack by proposing cuts himself . He fears Congress would interpret such a move as a sign of political weakness , and a signal to cut much deeper than he wants . " He 's been told that he 's going to get cuts whether he wants them or not , and he understands that , " one of his closest aides says . And even an adviser who wants reductions sees the tactical logic in this approach . " If you 're facing an assault , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser says . This Is n't a Game ' Mr. Weinberger bristles at the very idea of setting a stage for compromise by agreeing to cuts in advance . " I have n't been willing to suggest that there are some programs in the budget we do n't need , because there are n't , " he says . " This is n't a game . It is n't some sort of stylized Japanese play , with theatrical characters . What are we trying to do here ? Are we trying to rebuild or to show we 're receptive to editorials and cooperative with Con-gress ? " About the furthest the secretary seems willing to go Is to try to refigure spending plans to allow for lower inflation . But any effort to claim such a " deflation dividend " could actually bolster the hottest Capitol Hill argument against Mr. Reagan 's program : that it will be unaffordable in future years when the biggest weapons bills come due . The reasoning is that , in the critics ' eyes . Mr. Reagan has already underestimated the eventual cost of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect gains in the fight against inflation , can only widen the gap , they argue . A Cutback Proposal Harold Brown , who was the secretary of defense under President Carter , says . " We now have a great many programs which have been started and which can not be fully completed " with the funds the Pentagon is likely to get . He favors canceling the B-1 pomber and two planned nuclear aircraft- - carrier battle groups , thus saving as much as $65 billion . Some evidence supports the charge that the price of the buildup has been underestimated . An internal Pentagon study , rejected by top officials there , concludes that the military has indeed underrated the cost of most of the weapons included in the buildup . A study by the Congressional Budget Office is expected to reach a similar conclusion . But such fears have been around for a year now , with little result , and even advocates of big cuts say Congress can do little more than trim a bit off the edges . Sen. Ernest Hollings has called for limiting annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8% or so Mr. Reagan is seeking . But the South Carolina Democrat concedes that Congress " has n't got the political will " to do it unless Mr. Reagan takes the lead . Former Secretary Brown glumly says the scaling back that he favors is " politically impossible " unless Mr. Reagan . Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee and House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill of Massachusetts all sign on . Why Cutting Is Difficult The reason cutting is so hard , Sen. Nunn explains , is that " a huge constituency builds up behind every program . " For instance . California 's liberal Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston , a Reagan critic , nonetheless supports the California-built B-1 . The costly , limited-range F-18 fighter is a favorite target of many Democrats , but Speaker O'Neill backs it : The engines are made in Massachusetts . Rep. Joseph Addabbo is a foe of many proposals and led the charge against the MX missile , but the New York Democrat routinely adds funds for the A-10 , a plane that is made near his district . Pentagon hard-liners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A White House aide recalls telling a top defense official , " Look , I 'm a hawk too , I 'm from the right wing of the Republican Party . You may be winning all these budget battles , but ' you may lose the war . You got ta give some . " The Pentagon official , he says , " just looked at me and smiled and said , ' Our critics are all over the lot . They ca n't agree with each other . All we have to do is stand our ground , and they lose . ' "
