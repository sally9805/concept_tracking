The world is misbehaving again , and George Bush 's puppy presidency , like Jerry Ford 's English-muffin phase , has passed from American screens . Once again , as so often before , troops moved through the night ; a defiant dictatorship strode the dark streets of a tiny , helpless nation ; NATO complained and quibbled ; the Soviets unexpectedly moved a bishop in the great chess game of power . The convicted ghost of Ollie North haunted Pennsylvania Avenue , and House Speaker Jim Wright  --  a linchpin in this Government , like him or not  --  teetered . The weary old terrestrial sphere was either too hot or too cold and capricious in doling out its moisture . God may be in his heaven , but for the nonce he is not a Republican and not at the end of Bush 's overheated phone line . <P> From dawn to dusk these days , Bush has taken the dewy path along the Rose Garden and wondered about his fate . Not in despondency  --  that is not his nature  --  but in a detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after long hours of deliberation and said , " The decisions are getting tougher . " So true . No good answers present themselves . He chooses now from the best of the bad , which is the usual way in government . Last Thursday his crisis pace reached its peak , as shown in these remarkable pictures . <P> Between the global troubles , the President spent time with Richard Darman , director of the Office of Management and Budget . " I 've been talking about 1991 , " he said with a rueful smile , " and I do n't like a thing I 've heard so far . " For the moment Mikhail Gorbachev , the wily Slav , and General Manuel Noriega , the Latin scoundrel , hold the spotlight , but Bush knows that in the long run , the monstrous , suffocating federal budget may be his biggest threat . <P> As the world has closed in on him , Bush has gone to his faithful telephone . Just 15 minutes before he was scheduled to make his statement to the nation on sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put in a call to Costa Rica 's President Oscar Arias Sanchez , the Nobel Peace laureate , even though he had spoken with him just a few hours earlier . " I 'd just feel better if I know what 's on his mind , " the President said . <P> As the minutes ticked down to airtime , he suddenly looked up and asked , " Is there anything else I should know about ? " One of his assistants said that earlier in the day Gorbachev had made a new proposal on arms reduction but that the U.S. had not fully digested it . " What is it ? " Bush snapped . " Find out . " Aides scurried for information from National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft . Bush tucked the new development away in his mind without comment , a kind of armor against questions that might arise in his upcoming press conference .
