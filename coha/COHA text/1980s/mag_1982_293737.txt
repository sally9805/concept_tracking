PORKY 'S <P> Scrawl a bit of American Graffiti across the front door of Animal House and you have a rough idea of Porky 's effect . It has some of Graffiti 's sweetness of spirit , but none of its style or depth of feeling ; it has some of Animal 's raunchiness , but none of its loony anarchy . The title refers to a ' 50s bawdy house where six Florida youths search for sexual initiation , find humiliation , and then , by revenging themselves on its proprietor , achieve a sort of do-it-yourself rite de passage . The rest of the time they spend spying on the girls ' locker room and recalling the sex jokes of yesteryear . Bob Clark ( Murder by Decree ) is the writer-director here . If he knew how to stage comedy , or find a scene 's point , Porky 's might have achieved something more than the lackadaisical good nature Clark shyly offers . <P> <P> DEATHTRAP <P> He can no longer write a successful mystery play , but Sidney Bruhl ( Michael Caine ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For real . With his wife 's inheritance at stake . His plot has wit and intricacy going for it-so much so that it can not be described , lest the fun be spoiled for those who have not yet seen Ira Levin 's original Broadway hit . Director Sidney Lumet has , perhaps , permitted the volume to be turned up too high , with the result that Caine and the other principals , Christopher Reeve and Dyan Cannon , sometimes seem screechy when they reach for the high notes . But one can still appreciate the professionalism with which Levin crafted them and the larky spirits with which the performers force the suspension of incredulity . <P> <P> AMIN-THE RISE AND FALL <P> " Doctor , " reproves the Black Lion of Uganda , " for an African you are looking very white . " Statesman , sportsman , raconteur , eccentric gourmet , General Idi Amin Dada made a lot of people blanch in his eight years as Uganda 's dictator . With Amin now in asylum in Saudi Arabia , Director Sharad Patel has felt free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amin struts across his domain like Kong with a salad of Day-Glo medals pinned to his chest . Amin expels Asian workers from Uganda and distributes the spoils to his private army of hitmen . Amin services an interracial harem . Amin juggles the lives of Arab radicals and Jewish captives at Entebbe airport . Amin eats the flesh of an honest judge he has ordered killed . Perhaps Patel too lovingly details the baroque torture , and Joseph Olita 's unsteady command of the acting craft often makes Amin seem too cuddly a cannibal . Still , the film serves as an effective comic-book primer on the most colorful mass murderer of the ' 70s.
