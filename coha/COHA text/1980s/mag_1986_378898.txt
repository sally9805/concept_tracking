It was one of those tentative secret decisions that aim to give something to everyone . But the document drafted after an intense National Security Council meeting last week had elements to placate all sides of the Administration 's fractious arms-negotiating team . In a significant victory for Secretary of State George Shultz , Reagan decided to scrap two American submarines to continue  --  for now  --  compliance with the unratified SALT II treaty . Yet to please Pentagon hard-liners , he set the stage for " proportionate responses " to alleged Soviet violations . Work will be accelerated on the small single-warhead mobile missile known as the Midgetman and on an advanced radar-evading cruise missile . He proposed a study of yet another new mobile missile , dubbed Mobileman , which would be about the size of the 78,000-lb. silo-based Minuteman . <P> The contortions were prompted by the fact that on May 20 a new Trident submarine is due to slip into the sea off Connecticut . Its 24 ballistic missiles would put the U.S. over the SALT II ceiling . Although Reagan once called that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve the informal agreement by both superpowers to abide by its provisions ; he ordered that two older Poseidon subs be scrapped . SALT 's critics , most notably Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , urged that the old subs be mothballed and kept ready as a protest against alleged Soviet breaches . But violating SALT II would have upset Congress and the European allies and possibly derailed the summit as well . <P> Reagan 's decision to accelerate work on the 38,000-lb . Midgetman was designed to please strategists who favor the small mobile missiles . Their reasoning : compared with the Minuteman and the new MX , the truck-carried Midgetman will be less vulnerable to a pre-emptive strike and less destabilizing because it can not threaten a knockout blow of its own . Many in the Pentagon , however , would like to put more warheads on the Midgetman and make it larger . Hence Reagan 's decision to order study of a possible Mobileman missile , carrying as many as three warheads . Adding warheads , opponents protest , will make the weapons more destabilizing and could prompt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles . <P> Never one to decide such matters once and for all , Reagan left his options open . He indicated that the U.S. might scrap SALT II if the Soviets did not clean up their act , and he said nothing about what he will do in December , when modernized B-52s are to be fitted with new cruise missiles that would again push the U.S. past the treaty 's limits .
