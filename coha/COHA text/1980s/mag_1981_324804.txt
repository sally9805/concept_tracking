TRANSFORMING BLOOD <P> Of the four blood groups in humans , type O is the most useful in transfusions . Unlike other blood types-A , B and AB-O can be safely given to nearly everybody . <P> Thus a person with O blood has been dubbed the universal donor . Though 45% of the population are group O , the supply of donated O blood on hand is often not enough to meet needs . If it were possible to convert blood from the other three groups to type O , however , that supply would be dramatically increased . Researchers at the New York Blood Center have taken an important step toward that goal . Experiments directed by Biochemist Jack Goldstein have transformed type B red blood cells to type O. Using a " cutting " enzyme extracted from coffee beans , the researchers clipped a specific sugar molecule away from the surface of B red blood cells , making the cells virtually indistinguishable from those in type O blood . <P> Preliminary tests are very promising . <P> In volunteers injected with transformed blood , 95% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . After one month , 50% of the cells survived , which compares favorably with transfusion of untreated cells . The volunteers suffered no side effects . Researchers are now looking for an enzyme that could change type A cells to type O. Only 10% to 12% of the population belong to group B , compared with 40% type A. <P> <P> THE MICKEY FINN UPDATED <P> The Texas businessman was delighted when an attractive woman accepted his invitation for a nightcap in his Manhattan hotel room . But after a couple of drinks , he went blank . When he did not show up for a morning business meeting , his colleagues grew worried . They went to his room and found the Texan wild-eyed , heart pounding and his mouth dry as cotton . He was also hallucinating about little creatures that were trying to get him . <P> Some creatures had already got his money , credit cards and jewelry . <P> The old Mickey Finn ploy ? Yes , but the visitor had fallen victim to a new and dangerous twist . In the past two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ( and a few women ) not with the usual chloral hydrate-a sedative that simply makes a person drunk more quickly-but with scopolamine . This nervous-system depressant is normally used as a preoperative drug . It is also an ingredient in some prescription eye drops . <P> Dr. Lewis Goldfrank , director of emergency services at Bellevue Hospital , who discovered the larcenous trend and sees several cases a week , warns that the drug could cause heart arrest or coma . His advice : <P> " People should listen to their mothers and not take drinks from strangers . "
