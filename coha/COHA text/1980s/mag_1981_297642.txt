As anxious Europe watches , the U.S. and U.S.S.R. begin serious arms talks <P> The somber faces reflected the historic importance of the event . After nearly two years in which U.S.-Soviet relations alternated between brooding silence and intercontinental recrimination , representatives of the two superpowers faced each other across a 4-ft. - wide teak table in Geneva last week . " I think perhaps they would like to see us shaking hands , " said Paul Nitze , the silver-haired American chief negotiator , referring to the throng of photographers witnessing the scene . His Soviet counterpart , Yuli Kvitsinsky , extended his hand and smiled affably as shutters clicked . " Once more ? " the dapper Kvitsinsky inquired in unaccented English . " Yes , yes , " the photographers shouted , and the two men obliged . <P> Subsequent agreements may not come as easily as those opening handshakes , but the Geneva talks marked the warmest moment in U.S.-Soviet relations since the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 . For months , possibly years , the opposing delegations will meet every Tuesday at a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Disarmament Agency , and every Friday at the Soviet mission , a 19th century villa less than one mile away . Their goal is ambitious : to reach an agreement that would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in Europe . Progress in Geneva will be followed closely by the millions of Western Europeans who have taken to the streets this autumn to express their opposition to nuclear arms , notably NATO 's . Indeed , even Eastern Europeans are taking an interest in disarmament . Last Saturday 300,000 people marched through Bucharest , the capital of Rumania , demanding the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from both Eastern and Western Europe . <P> By mutual agreement , the Americans played host to the first full session of the talks . Nitze and his eleven aides chose to sit on the side of the table that offers a commanding view of the snow-capped Alps . Kvitsinsky and his eleven colleagues faced a windowless wall decorated with prints by ubiquitous Sports Artist LeRoy Neiman on themes of football ( the American kind ) , ice hockey and tennis . <P> At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to one ground rule : there would be a total blackout on information to the press . Nitze explained : " It is only by mutual respect for the confidentiality of these proceedings that we can hope to look at the hard issues which divide us , and to search for solutions that will assure security and reduce tensions . " When reporters tried to ask follow-up questions , the U.S. negotiator turned and walked out of the room .
