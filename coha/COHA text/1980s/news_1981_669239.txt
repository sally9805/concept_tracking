Independent , experimental , and documentary films are being churned out all over the world . And there ' s a rich backlog of such pictures from the past , waiting for their chance to speak to new generations. // The big question is  --  how can we see these movies ? While many cities have " repertory " theaters devoted to Hollywood revivals , independent and documentary works can still have a hard time finding the serious audience that would respond to them. // It is encouraging that imaginative and innovative programmers are wrestling with this very problem . Among them are two women based in New York , working in very different venues , but both committed to the proposition that smart movies and smart audiences deserve each other , and can thrive when given the opportunity. // Karen Cooper runs the Film Forum , an 11-year-old showplace for offbeat productions , which recently moved to a spanking new " twin cinema " at 57 Watts Street in lower Manhattan . Wendy Keys , associate director of the Film Society of Licoln Center , heads a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in their schools . On a broader level , she also assembles a " special event " for each year ' s New York Film Festival . Her latest program , on-screen at the Paramount Theater through Sept. 22 , is a boisterous selection with the unlikely collective title of " Movies for Cynics. " // Housed in a converted garage near the SoHo neighborhood , decorated with a spunky mural by filmmaker Robert Breer , the Film Forum reflects the broad tastes of Karen Cooper , who has been its director since 1972 . Specializing in independent films  --  domestic and foreign  --  her goal is to legitimize such work by removing it from the museum and the film society and showing it in a regular and commercial setting . Thus the Film Forum is a real movie theater , from the refreshment counter in the lobby to the first-rate projection facilities inside . Only the program is unusual. // " I ' ll show anything and everything , " Miss Cooper said in her upstairs office on the first day of business in her new building. " i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the theory  --  sometimes correct , sometimes not  --  that if I respond to a film. other people will . It ' s a treasure hunt . I can ' t say what I ' m looking for , because I wouldn ' t be doing my job if I were looking for anything in particular. there ' s no kind of film I ' m closed off from. " // Yet she has her tastes , and these are basic to her programming . " I ' m less involved with the avant-garde than some programmers , " she says . " I lean less toward the conceptual , the theoretical , and the dry . I prefer films that get a gut response from the viewer . I like works with strong content , and which present that content in new , innovative , and personalized ways . I wouldn ' t show a documentary that looked like an ' NBC White Paper . ' I ' d be bored to deat . I believe in film as an art form , with content that ' s of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in action , consider her current program . The opening attraction at Film Forum 1 is " 14 Americans : Directions of the 1970s , ; a straightforward documentary by Michael Blackwood about 14 artists , from musician Laurie Anderson to furniture sculptor Scott Burton . Also on the bill is the short " Ameican Is Waiting , " the latest brilliant movie-college by West Coast experimenter Bruce Conner , who transforms old film footage into breath-taking personal visions , this time with a musical score by rockers David Byrne and Brian Eno. // Coming up between now and Christmas are " September Wheat " by Peter Krieg , a West German documentary about world hunger , paired with a 1909 short by D. W. Griffith , " A Corner in Wheat . " Next comes " Tiefland , " a rare fiction film about a beautiful Spanish dancer by former Hitler propagandist Leni Riefenstahl , whose works are in many cases as cinematicaly respected as they are thematically controversial. // Filmed in Africa by David and Judith MacDougall , " Lorang ' s Way " and " Under the Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is as Good as 10 Mothers , " by Les Blank , heads a bill that includes Blank ' s " Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe " and " Stoney Know How " by Alan Governar and Bruce Lane . " Strong Medicine " is the first movie by the amazing avant-garde theater director Richard Foreman . " Clarence &; Angel , " by Robert Gardner , is about minority children ; it will be accompanied by Warrington Hudlin ' s " Capoeira of Brazil. " // It ' s a divese selection , and an international one . " About half my programming is European , South American , Israeli , Scandinavian , Japanese , " says Miss Cooper . " One thing like most about film is that it crosses national barriers , speaking to people across time and across borders . It ' s important for Americans , who can be very parochial , to see work from other parts of the world. " // his attitude is further borne out next door in Film Forum 2 , which is programmed by Daniel Talbot of New Yorker films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West German prodigy Rainer Werner Fassbinder , to be followed by a festival of Werner Herzog , including New York premiers of his " Signs of Life " and " Land of Silence and Darkness . " Miss Cooper hopes these bona-fide " art films " will help draw a wider-than-ever audience to the Film Forum building  --  " people who might otherwise ignore the more eccentric , oddball , independent work in Theater No. 1. " // Part of Miss Cooper ' s task is getting word around to audiences who might have special interest in her shows . She values press coverage highly , and tries to steer publicity toward appropriate groups  --  working with the World Council of Churches , for instance , to purvey information about " September Wheat " and its subject of world hunger vis-a-vis big business. // She also hopes the films she exhibits will go on greater life afterwards . " Most of them are available from Americasn distributors , or from the filmmakers themselves , " she says . They often show up later in nontheatrical settings  --  libraries , universities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might well get a call from Kansas City , asking how someone can get hold of it. " // Since mass-market films are generally avoided at Film Forum , the economics of the establishment are tricky . Box-office returns are supplemented with grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts . Funds for the new building came largely from a Ford Foundation low-interest loan . But director Cooper dreams of a day when ticket sales might foot the whole bill . Then independent film will truly have come into its own , and Film Forum will deserve a fine share of the credit . <> <> N.Y. Film Festival // The Film Society of Lincoln Center is also helping the cause these days , by including independently made movies in its annual New York Film Festival beginning Sept. 25 . Three years ago , in a notable burst of enthusiasm , the festival presented an entire " special event " called " American Independent Films . " Again this year , several such items are included in a sidebar show at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall title " Movies for Cynics. " // Assembled by Wendy Keys , this extravaganza follows such previous " special events " as " British Film Now , " a prescient look at the reviving British movie industry , and collections of representative animated and Japanese pictures . Well-attended by viewers and covered by the press , such shows swing between introducing new work and bringing back earlier films for reconsideration. // The current selection of " Movies for Cynics " includes such uncynical favorites as Chaplin ' s " The Great Dictator , " Arthur Hiller ' s " The Americanization of Emily , " and Preston Sturges ' s " The Great McGinty . " And such very cynical efforts as " Smile " by Michael Ritchie , " Putney Swope " by Robert Downey , " Winter Kills " by William Richert , " TAking Off " by Milos Forman , and " First Family " by Buck Henry . Also on view are new or rarely seen items including Larry Cohen ' s comic-strippish " The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover , " Thomas Cohen ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double bill of " El Salvador : Another Vietnam " by Glenn Silber and Tete Vasconcellas with " Nixon : From Checkers to Watergate " by Charles Braverman . An uneven selection of shorts rounds out the program. // Why put together a list of movies for cynics ? Miss Keys explains , " There ' s a new consevative mood in the country . A new way of thinking is afoot in the land . At the film society , we decided that the issues we consider important  --  both political and social  --  don ' t have easy answers of right and wrong , good or bad , right or left . We feel everything of importance should be looked at with a clear , fresh , and perhaps cynical eye. " // Hence the program Miss Keys has drawn up , hoping to launch some new movies along this line , and revitalize the reputations of some older ones . " These present  --  with a twist  --  situations we feel are important , " she says . " In some cases they ridicule an issue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely . It doesn ' t matter whether you agree with the film ' s point of view . At least it ' s an alternative to be considered. " // Many of the selections are Hoolywood comedies , with good reason . " Lots of American films have made their points through satire or ridicule , " says Miss Keys . " But we ' ve discovered that the gentler the ridicule , the more effective the point . A good example is ' Smile . ' It has a subject  --  a beauty contest  --  that ' s ripe for harsh exploitation and sneering . But the director makes you like the characters and see their motives . You come out with a rather warm feeling , even though it ' s funny and absurd. " // Some spectators may differ with Miss Keys ' s view , or with her decision this year to include several often-seen movies instead of introducing more unknown or rarely encountered films , as in previous years . But there ' s no gainsaying the diversity of her selection , which ranges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as " First Family " and " Winter Kills " ) that were commercial failures the first time around . These may now grow in reputation , while such new items as " J. Edgar Hoover " and " EL Salvador " may be widely seen after being launched at this prestigious festival. // Besides assembling such special events , Miss Keys also administers an educational program which sends unconventional films and filmmakers to visit students in high and junior-high schools . Participants have included such luminaries as Claudia Weill , exerimentalist Stan Vanderbeek , and the yound Martin Scorsese . We use mostly young filmmakers , " says Miss Keys , " so the kids will know that movies aren ' t all made by Cecil B. DeMille ; it can be just a young person with a camera . We stress the **28;8280; why <> a film was made , not the **28;8310; how . <> The aim isn ' t to steer kids toward a career in film , but to expand their knowledge of the workings of the process . " About 50 schools each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is part of a larger Lincoln Center program that includes dancers , musicians , and other artists. // Such institutions as Miss Cooper ' s Film Forum and Miss Keys ' s festival events aren ' t likely to turn the movie world upside-down . But they provide alternatives to the usual commercial fare , and suggest new points of view for considering our attitudes toward film as an art and movies as an entertainment . By launching new pictures and ideas , their effect is subtle but broad . Without them , cinema would be the poorer. // //
