NEW YORK  --  American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , spurred by the need to cut costs , said it will freeze the salary structure for its 114 , 000 managers companywide , or about one third of its work force . The company said the freeze , which will take effect in April when salary increases normally would next take place , should save AT &; nearly $184 million , or 4% , in salary expenses in 1985 . Chairman Charles L. Brown , in a statement , said the salary freeze is " a necessary element in our comprehensive effort to reduce costs in every aspect of our operations . We must find ways to become more efficient in doing those things which need doing , from programming a computer to selling a major communications system to managing our network to repairing a telephone . " About a month ago , AT &; vice chairman James E. Olson told the AT &; Technologies Inc. division that the company was embarking on a comprehensive cost-cutting effort . The goal , he said , was to reduce costs 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is really no activity that is going to be exempt from scrutiny , " according to an AT &; spokesman . Dan Hesse , AT &; Communications Inc. ' s national account manager for Exxon Corp. , said the salary-scale freeze is just one way AT &; is trying to cut expenses . Travel and entertainment expenses also are being scrutinized more carefully than in the past . " We are exercising as much expense control in the business as possible , " Mr. Hesse said ; he has been with AT &; for seven years . " I think management as a group is very supportive of upper management ' s decision to freeze wages . We ' re all concerned about the long-term viability of the business . " He added that the freeze didn ' t give him any incentive to leave . AT &; isn ' t imposing a blanket freeze on all salaries . The company ' s salary system can be likened to an escalator consisting of about five informal yearly " steps " in each of 10 hierarchical grades . It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the new plan , employees will continue to progress from step to step and may be promoted into higher grades , earning more money as they climb . However , the salary amount at each " step " has been frozen . In 1984 , for example , the average manager who rose one step within a grade received a raise of about 4% . But the pay level of each step also rose by about 3. 5% , giving the manager who moved up a step a total raise of about 7. 5% . By stopping the " escalator , " the same manager would get only a 4% raise next year . AT &; said merit raises , beyond the step raises , still can be obtained , but have been capped . Also , the company said managers don ' t automatically move up , step by step , each year and can in fact receive no raises under the current system . William McKeever , analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said the salary-structure freeze " isn ' t going to change our opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a significant enough effect to make us change our earnings estimates . " Currently , Mr. McKeever is estimating that AT &; will earn $1. 40 in 1984 and $1. 55 in 1985 . Mr. McKeever said AT &; cost-cutting efforts are seriously hampered by excessive access charges , or the fees AT &; must pay to local telephone operating companies for use of their networks . According to government statistics , he said , for every $1 AT &; earns in long-distance revenue , the company must pay out 75 cents to the local phone companies in access charges . The result , Mr. McKeever said , is that " they have very little control on the communications side ( of the business ) of their operating expenses . " Even though the cost savings from the salary freeze won ' t have a significant impact on earnings , analyst Steven Chrust , of Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co. said the move is " no question a good sign and setting them in the right direction . It ' s clearly evidence of the track toward greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment on the freeze , but a number said it was a necessary cost-cutting move to assure AT &; ability to compete in the long-term . " I applaud it , " said Allen Rehert , a 22-year AT &; veteran who manages 100 people marketing network services and who is at the top of his salary bracket . " The company is taking the steps required in a competitive environment . " William West , a division manager in AT &; Communications who has been with the company 15 years , pointed out that he still could get bonuses based on merit . " From my standpoint , I think it ' s something the company has done for good business reasons , " Mr. West said . " We could lose people who see this as saying that over the long term they ' ll have a reduction in their opportunities at AT &; I don ' t think , personally , that there will be ( such a ) reduction . " Mr. West added that , while his subordinates might personally be unhappy with the freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business decision .
