It 's been customary to write about New Orleans as a foreign city . The tropics are often mentioned , particularly if the writer has had the bad luck to arrive in August : steamy , sensuous , tempting , vaguely dangerous . Some have dwelt on New Orleans ' French origins , some on its Latin flair for celebration . It has been described as Mediterranean and Levantine . In 1960 , when I first started writing about New Orleans , I told a man I knew there  --  a wise man , who had spent his whole life in New Orleans , taking in the show  --  that some of the goings-on connected with the desegregation of the schools struck me as , to put it politely , bizarre . " What you have to remember to keep it all in perspective , " he said , " is that this is not the southern United States . This is northern Costa Rica . " <P> There are , of course , enclaves in a lot of American cities that feel foreign because one group or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other country . In New Orleans the mainstream can have foreign ways . No one who ever took a close look at Mardi Gras could come away with the impression that it 's merely a straightforward American spectacle in the tradition of , say , the Indianapolis 500 or the Pasadena Tournament of Roses . In 1964 I was in New Orleans to do a piece on the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club , a black burial society whose members traditionally paraded on Mardi Gras in blackface , wearing grass skirts and tossing coconuts to the crowd . A week before Mardi Gras , I watched cheerfully drunk white longshoremen boogie down the street for hours in women 's clothing behind a black jazz band , in what they called a practice parade of their Carnival marching society  --  as if any of that took any practice . I talked to light-complected , Catholic , French-named blacks who said that the Zulu Parade was what you might expect of the darker , Protestant blacks they still occasionally referred to then as " American Negroes . " I interviewed prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose floats parade through the streets during the Carnival season on the way to elaborate balls  --  were at the center of their lives . If lengthy and solemn discussions about which debutante should be queen of Rex or Comus are carried out every year by the business leaders of a city  --  not the wives of the business leaders , the business leaders  --  could it be an American city ? <P> New Orleans has traditionally nurtured some distinctly non-American attributes , like indolence . There have always been a good number of people who are not eager to get ahead . Even its businessmen have had a reputation for being only mildly industrious and distinctly non-entrepreneurial . New Orleans has been known as a place content to make do with its natural endowments  --  a great port on the Mississippi River , and a share of the state oil money , and a reputation for wickedness and charm that drew a steady stream of tourists for decades . For most of this century , New Orleans has n't done much more than make do . It has never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has always had a lot of poor people ; its rich people have never been seriously rich .
