The hellish orange-and-white fireball that destroyed the space shuttle Challenger exploded over the Atlantic Ocean two years ago this week , killing seven crew members and shutting down the U.S. manned space program . Pressures to launch had led to what the Rogers commission later called NASA 's " silent safety program , " in which defects were overlooked and engineering cautions brushed aside . Yet as NASA and its many contractors now rush to correct the ! shuttle 's potentially fatal weaknesses and resume launches by July , there are signs that the lesson of the Challenger tragedy has not been wholly heeded . <P> A blue-ribbon committee of eight experts commissioned by NASA to review the agency 's safety procedures has warned that the " concern for safety that peaked after the Challenger accident appears to be waning . " The investigators stated that when NASA rated its program managers , safety was " conspicuous by its absence " in the evaluation . There was also " disturbing " evidence that schedules were given priority over safety . The highly critical report was submitted to NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was kept under wraps until this month . <P> The report also charges that those in NASA 's contractor network who spoke up about lax safety practices sometimes ran into a " shoot-the-messen ger syndrome " in which their complaints were ignored and they were harshly criticized . Several such whistle-blowers have told TIME that when they pointed out glaring violations of safety procedures , nothing was done to correct the problems . Instead , they contend , they were harassed , demoted or fired . Some say they were even threatened by unidentified letter writers and telephone callers . <P> Sylvia Robins is a former systems engineer for Unisys , a subcontractor that develops much of the computer software in Houston used to control virtually every switch and nozzle on the complex space vehicle . Two years ago , she was a highly rated section supervisor in charge of managing the software that had been updated to reflect changes in the shuttle 's mission and design . In March 1986 , two months after the Challenger tragedy , she was approached for help by software experts at Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to find out whether Unisys had an adequate system for testing the shuttle 's backup software , which would be vital if the basic computer programming failed . <P> Robins claims she discovered a self-defeating Unisys procedure : instead of halting other operations while both the main and backup software were tested , the contractor permitted NASA to make additional changes in payload and other shuttle flight plans as the testing proceeded . While this saved a three-week hold for each test , she insists that it rendered the results meaningless , since the software could not be adjusted and tested simultaneously . <P> When Robins informed her Unisys supervisors about this in June 1986 , she + maintains she was told to drop the matter and not tell Rockwell about it . Her bosses considered her a trouble maker , she says , because she had complained earlier that Unisys did not have the proper facilities for protecting the software for secret Defense Department missions assigned to shuttle flights .                    @
