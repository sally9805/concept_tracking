Iraq uses missiles and gas <P> Ever since last October , when the French delivered five Super Etendard fighter planes , Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been threatening to use the sophisticated weaponry to stop Iran from exporting oil from its Kharg Island terminal . That threat roused international concern . If Saddam Hussein proved as bad as his word , the war between Iraq and Iran might extend to other parts of the Persian Gulf and affect oil shipments of such Iraqi neighbors and benefactors as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia . Last week those fears came closer to facts . Baghdad sent the French planes into action , striking two ships . As it happened , neither was carrying Iranian oil , and both were under contract to Kuwaiti and Saudi oil companies . <P> The first word that Iraq had used the Super Etendards came in a military communiqu boasting that the planes had attacked " two naval targets " near Kharg Island . In fact , a low-flying missile fitting the description of a radar-controlled Exocet reportedly hit a 41,000-ton Greek tanker , Filikon L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . The ship , under contract to the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. , had just loaded up with fuel at the Kuwaiti port of Mina al Ahmadi . Damage proved relatively minor , but a second ship hit in the same attack was not so lucky . A South Korean supply vessel under contract to Aramco , the Saudi oil company , which was serving offshore rigs at the Saudi oilfields of Marjon , exploded , caught fire and sank . At least one crewman was killed and four others were injured . <P> Neither Kuwait nor Saudi Arabia , both of which have supplied Iraq with billions of dollars , made any public comment on the attacks last week . But Iraq seemed to have broken an agreement under which Baghdad would continue receiving aid for its war against Iran in return for not attacking Iranian oil shipments . Despite its poor performance , Iraq launched yet another attack two days later . This time four ships in a convoy sailing toward the Iranian port of Bandar Khomeini were hit . A 16,000-ton Greek freighter , lapetos , caught fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopters to rescue the crewmen , Iraq shot down the choppers . A senior Iranian military officer suggested that Iraq 's attacks on small foreign ships were a calculated effort to bring international pressure to find a resolution to the four-year-old war . Said the officer : " Saddam Hussein does n't want to do much damage for fear of alienating Washington and other foreign powers . But he wants to scare everybody into getting him peace . " <P> In fact , Iraq had already introduced an even deadlier scare : the use of chemical warfare against Iran . Last month Washington publicly condemned the use of mustard gas by Iraq against Iranians . Last week U.S. officials said they have evidence that Iraq is using nerve gas on the battlefield . A West German firm , officials said , has supplied Iraq with laboratory equipment that can produce the nerve gas . The Administration embargoed five chemical compounds essential in producing the gas from being shipped to either Iraq or Iran , but officials concede that most of the compounds are available on the world market . A State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to bomb the nerve-gas production sites . Yet both nations view the matter as perilous.
