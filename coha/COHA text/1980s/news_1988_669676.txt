' ' I know this sounds cataclysmic , ' ' says an informed Western diplomat , ' ' but the end of the Lebanese Republic is possible without the right decisions ' ' in the days ahead. // Syria and the leaders of the Christian enclave around Beirut are in a political standoff over choosing a successor to President Amin Gemayel. // ' ' There are less than two weeks to test which side is bluffing and to what extent , ' ' says a Reagan administration source . ' ' And there is great opportunity for miscalculation by all the parties. ' ' // // Richard Murphy , US assistant secretary of state for the Middle East , left for Syria and Lebanon late Monday . His mission : to see if the US can help bridge the gap between the parties. // President Gemayel ' s term ends Sept. 23 . Without a solution by then , Lebanon may well find itself with two rival governments and new centrifugal pressures on the last vestiges of a central state in that country. // In turn , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or others , informed Western diplomats say , sparking new regional tensions. // ' ' This is the most critical situation in 14 years of civil war , ' ' a senior Lebanese official says . ' ' The most crucial issue is that the republic endures with any president . If it endures , there is hope for a solution . But right now , it ' s not clear if Syria wants one or two Lebanons. ' ' // Concern in Washington is high . The US has maintained intensive diplomatic contact with the key actors in the process . During the last year , the US tried to mediate an agreement on constitutional reform in Lebanon which could form the basis for political reconciliation there . But the US effort ground to a halt as the presidential elections neared this summer. // ' ' This is an historic test , ' ' a US source says . ' ' The Lebanese or Syrians can choose to keep alive the possibility of restoring unity and integrity to Lebanon , or they can drive it over the cliff. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the armed US intervention in Lebanon that ended disastrously in the early 1980s . But there is a great deal of interest in containing the often violent spillover from Lebanon ' s civil war and , if possible , encouraging reconciliation . <> <> Concessions out of near-disaster ? // Ironically , it may be possible to use the impending disaster to get concessions from all sides , one administration source says . Ideally , this official says , one could forge an agreement not only on a new president but on reform of the Constitution and a mutually acceptable form of power-sharing among Lebanon ' s warring factions and Syria. // But this source and others are quick to add that time is short and mistrust is high on all sides . Many Lebanese are only looking for a ' ' Band-Aid ' ' that will postpone the tough decisions , one Western diplomat says. // The potential for trouble is immense . In a worst-case scenario , say well-placed diplomats , the Lebanese civil war could burst into full flame and spark a wider conflagration involving Israel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mid-August policy shift by Syria , informed sources say . In a change from earlier understandings with the US and Lebanese Christians , Syria began to strongly support the presidential candidacy of a former Lebanese president , Suleiman Franjieh. // Though a Christian , Mr. Franjieh is opposed by most Christians and the vast majority of Muslim and other Lebanese , informed Western sources say . He is perceived as a tool of Syria and a conservative on constitutional reform . All of those questioned say he has debilitating problems associated with his advanced age , further limiting his ability to deal with the tough problems ahead if elected. // But the Syrians are able to coerce most of the non-Christian parliamentarians to vote the way they want , say a range of informed Western diplomats and Lebanese sources . Thus the Christians around Beirut fear that Damascus would be able to ram Franjieh to victory in Lebanon ' s parliament , which is charged with electing the president to a six-year term . So the Christians organized a boycott of the presidential vote that had been scheduled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Franjieh or no elections . The Syrian-supported Lebanese opposition ( Muslim and Druze ) have also now said they will not agree to elections unless the Christians first agree to specific constitutional reforms divvying political power. // The Christians say a consensus candidate - who by tradition would be Christian - should be elected and then negotiations on reform be continued . If no agreement is reached before the end of the current presidential term on Sept. 23 , President Gemayel intends to name a Christian prime minister to head a Christian-Muslim government , a close Gemayel associate says. // The Syrians say they will support the existing government headed by a Muslim prime minister . They are threatening an air , sea , and land blockade of the Christian enclave around Beirut if Gemayel names a new government , informed Western diplomats say . Intelligence sources add that Damascus has indirectly issued even more ominous threats of terrorism against the Christian enclave. // The formation of rival governments could destroy the last vestiges of a national government in Lebanon and would invite more foreign involvement. // For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclave , diplomatic sources say . Iraq , Syria ' s archrival , has already surpassed Israel as the main arms supplier of the Christian Lebanese Forces militia in and around Beirut and could be expected to continue its support , says one senior Arab diplomat. // Israel would not stand by and watch the Christians be crushed . Key West European states are reportedly prepared to recognize the enclave . The PLO is also cooperating closely with the Lebanese Forces , and Egypt is a strong supporter of Lebanon ' s central government. // ' ' The Syrians can do the same things the Turks did in Cyprus , but no one will recognize their government , ' ' says a well-placed Lebanese Christian . ' ' If they try a blockade , it will hurt their Lebanese allies , and if they try to take us by force , they will need 50 , 000 more troops . . . We ' ve learned that there is no solution here without Syria , but Syria still seems to think it can impose a solution. ' ' // US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this impasse . Washington does not want to face the prospect of choosing sides , or deciding whether or not to restrain Israel from intervening in the event of renewed hostilities inside Lebanon . <> <> Deciphering Syrian moves // An essential element is figuring out what the Syrians really want and getting the parties into a position where their bottom-line can be tested , say Western diplomats and Lebanese officials. // The US is currently trying to determine why Syria shifted its support to Franjieh and how firm that decision is . Washington had thought Syrian President Hafez Assad had agreed to search for a consensus candidate who supported constitutional reform. // Syria is charging that the US urged parliamentarians to stay away from the failed Aug. 18 election . It also says the US reneged on its support for some key constitutional reform proposals. // US officials deny both allegations. // Informed Middle Eastern diplomats say Syria ' s apparently firm support for Franjieh was generated by non-Lebanese events - the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and Jordan ' s decision to opt out of the Palestinian question. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cease-fire , they say . This freed Syria ' s longtime rival , Iraq , to focus on Syria and Lebanon. // ' ' The Iraqis feel they have a settling of accounts with Syria , because of its support for Iran , ' ' says one Arab ambassador in Washington . ' ' Similarly , when ( Jordan ' s ) King Hussein opted out of the peace process , it diminished Syria ' s role by changing the focus from an Arab-Israeli contest to an Israeli-Palestinian dispute. ' ' // These events , he says , changed President Assad ' s perspectives . Lebanon was simultaneously even more important for Syria and more vulnerable . Thus Assad opted for a presidential candidate ' ' he could completely trust. ' ' // //
