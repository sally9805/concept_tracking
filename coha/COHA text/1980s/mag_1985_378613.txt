Once again , Nehme Yafet Street in West Beirut was a battleground . Gunmen from rival Shi'ite Muslim and Druze militias crouched in doorways and fired bursts from automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades into the darkness . Four floors above the fierce firefight , Terry Waite , the special envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury , was trapped with staff members of the Associated Press . A giant of a man , who stands 6 ft. 7 in. and weighs 258 lbs. , the bearded Waite , 46 , was in Beirut to seek the release of four of the American hostages held by Muslim extremists . As bullets chipped the walls of the A.P . bureau , Waite seized the opportunity to take a shower . " If you ca n't do anything else , " he explained , " you might as well make use of the time . " <P> Waite himself had become a temporary captive of the violence that so often engulfs the city . He had planned to fly to Cyprus that night and on to New York , but the bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told reporters that although he had made progress in his efforts to free the hostages and felt that " a good measure of mutual trust has been established , " he still faced " grave difficulties " in his quest . Finally , on Sunday , he escaped the street fighting and headed to New York City , where he was scheduled to report to U.S. officials on his progress before returning to Beirut this week . <P> Since his arrival three days earlier  --  it was his second visit to Beirut in less than a week  --  Waite said , he had met with the kidnapers twice at secret locations in the city . Waite said he was satisfied " beyond all doubt " that he was dealing with the real kidnapers , believed to be members of Islamic Jihad , a shadowy Shi'ite Muslim extremist movement . " The situation remains very dangerous , " he emphasized . " False steps , however well intentioned , that interfere with the process I have started could end in disaster . " <P> Some 1,500 miles across the Mediterranean , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , en route from Athens to Cairo with approximately 100 people on board , was hijacked last Saturday and forced down at Luqa Airport on Malta . Demanding fuel to continue on to an unspecified destination , the hijackers , who identified themselves as members of a group called Egypt 's Revolution , threatened a systematic execution of passengers until the plane was refueled . By Sunday morning , the Maltese government had confirmed the death of one woman , tentatively identified as Nancy Stevens , 20 . The death toll was expected to rise . There were reports that six others , including one of the three Americans believed to be on board , had been injured . At one point , a hijacker had threatened in English , " I am going to look for another American passport . "
