Have you ever bought a record , taken it home and played it , only to be disappointed by the sound quality ? Or perhaps the record sounded fine at first but deteriorated with every playing until it sounded like it had been buffed with sandpaper . A few years ago , complaints about record quality seemed to increase dramatically in such places as magazines for audio enthusiasts . One reason was that record buyers suspected the manufacturers were cutting back on quality in the wake of big increases in the prices of raw materials ( the vinyl used in records is a petroleum byproduct ) . Another reason was that stereo equipment was improving so much that any flaws in records sounded much worse than before . Speakers were especially improved in their ability to reproduce high- frequency sounds such as record snap , crackle and pop . Several manufacturers , usually smaller companies , sensed there was a market for higher quality recordings and proposed several different approaches to the problem . One of the first to be widely publicized is called direct-to- disc . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording . The usual method today is to have musicians record their performance on conventional magnetic tape . A tape recorder plays the tape into a machine which cuts a disc . This disc is the prototype from which thousands of record copies are made . Direct-to-disc eliminates the tape machine . The musicians play into microphones connected to the record cutter . As the group plays , the master disc is cut . This is the way records were made before tape recording was invented . But the microphones and other electronic gear have improved so much that direct- to-disc sounds much better today than it did 50 years ago . In fact , it is supposed to provide a crisper , less distorted sound than recordings made from tapes . In a listening test , one direct-to-disc recording ( " the Four Seasons " by Vivaldi on RCA , RDCE-5001-2 ) revealed a very nice sound.The high notes come across nicely and the record seems more spacious than a conventional recording . Unfortunately the album costs $25 . This is a little steep even for direct- to-disc because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 1/3 and it has to go on two discs . Single direct-to-disc records cost about $15 . A conventional recording of the " Four Seasons " costs $4 to $10 . Other reasons for the high cost are that special vinyl is used and extra care is taken to make sure that all steps in the manufacturing process go flawlessly . There ' a another problem in direct-to-disc besides the high cost . Because the record is being cut as the musicians are playing , a mistake in performance means the recording must be started all over again . Also , it is difficult to record rock music with this method . Rock musicians are accustomed to recording guitars at one session , voices at another and drums at a third and then layering them electronically onto the tape . Without the tape machine they would have to develop a different way of recording this music . But engineers have developed a method that lets them keep the tape machine . Basically , the manufacturer has to make the record very , very carefully . The pioneer in this method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company obtains the " master tape " from the original manufacturer . That is the tape on which the performers recorded their album . Then it cuts the master disc in a special way by driving the disc-cutter turntable and tape recorder at half the usual speed . The company says the result of this process is that " musical accuracy , clarity and imaging are truly startling . " The company uses special equipment and special vinyl to make sure the finished record is as close to the half-speed master disc as possible . Mobile Fidelity has released more than 40 records , most of which were released earlier as conventional recordings , so it ' s easy to compare the two procedures . The Beatles ' " Abbey Road " was one of the company ' s first releases and it does sound better than the conventional record . The guitars are crisper and each instrument stands out much better . Unfortunately , the Mobile Fidelity version costs $15 compared with $5 to $8 for the conventional one . Is it worth it ? Only the wealthly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it ' s a nice treat to get one or two of them and hear how much better a favorite record can sound . Other companies are starting to use this method . CBS has issued Simon and Garfunkel ' s " Bridge over Troubled Water " in a half-speed mastered version . It costs $15 , too . Engineers have come up with another way to improve record quality . It ' s called digital recording and it promises to be the most significant development of all , but that ' s a subject for another column .
