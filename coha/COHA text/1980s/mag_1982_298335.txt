A standoff with guerrillas <P> For a week , Hondurans anxiously watched the stalemate in the northern industrial town of San Pedro Sula There , in the local Chamber of Commerce auditorium , leftist guerrillas held hostage scores of the country 's leading businessmen and three top government officials . Outside , the army stood guard holding its fire , but working on the guerrillas ' nerves during the long nights by banging garbage-can lids and throwing stones on the auditorium 's tin roof . Whether they willed it or not , Hondurans were being drawn more deeply into the political turmoil that plagues so many countries in Central America . <P> The drama began as some 100 Honduran executives were attending a seminar on their country 's economy . Suddenly eight to twelve terrorists ( estimates varied ) stormed into the building , firing automatic weapons and shouting , " Dogs , everyone on the floor ! " The gunmen , their faces covered by handkerchiefs , arranged their 105 hostages in two lines , head to head , face down on the floor . There they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one point , apparently as a warning , one of the guerrillas sprayed a volley of bullets just inches over the row of heads . " That was the absolute worst moment , " one hostage later recalled . <P> In the beginning , the guerrillas were less than efficient . Central Bank President Gonzalo Carias Pineda and five other hostages managed to hide in a broom closet for six hours before being forced out by lack of air . One prisoner escaped on the first morning by bolting through the front door ; two others climbed out a bathroom window . <P> The guerrillas identified themselves as members of the outlawed Cinchonero Popular Liberation Movement , a small revolutionary group that was named for the martyred leader of an obscure 19th century revolt . Their leader turned out to be a stocky , thirtyish chain smoker known as Chief 1 , who impressed the group of hostages with his relative calm and compassion . He released the wounded and female hostages when the government said it would not negotiate otherwise . As time wore on , the gunmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Government forces quickly sealed off the building and , after some initial exchanges of gunfire , settled in for the long negotiations . At first the guerrillas threatened to kill their prisoners unless the government complied with a list of demands ranging from nationalization of the school system to the release of 80 political prisoners . The government retorted that there were no political prisoners in Honduras . Moreover , it said , many of the people listed ' by the guerrillas were living abroad , and one , a Salvadoran rebel known as Comandante Alejandro Montenegro , was actually in custody in his own country . <P> As the talks with the government 's representatives continued , the guerrillas apparently dropped some of their demands , including a call for U.S. military advisers to leave the country . President Roberto Suazo Crdova , after visiting the scene , predicted a peaceful end to the standoff . So it was . At week 's end , the guerrillas released their last 34 hostages and were flown out of the country to an undisclosed destination .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
