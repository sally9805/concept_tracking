The purchase of the little blue wagon not only delighted Mrs. Barenholtz , but it started her husband on the way of building one of the world ' s great collections of American antique toys . With his background as a noted toy designer ( he is a cofounder of the firm Creative Playthings ) and connoisseur of American antiques and folk art , he quickly , perhaps inevitably , became fascinated by the exquisitely made tin and cast-iron toys of the last century. // The visual delight and rich mine of social history that his collection encompasses is the subject of a stunning new book , " American Antique Toys " ( Abrams , New York ) . Written in collaboration with another toy expert , Inez McClintock , it traces Mr. Barenholtz ' s amusing , often painstaking collecting experiences . It also imparts a solid overview of the history of American toys and the children who played with them . Accompanying the text are sumptuous photographs of the collection by Bill Holland. // Mr. Barenholtz ' s remarkable collection is in an octagonal gallery attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at almost any time of year a large portion of the toys are on exhibit at museums across the United States  --  200 of them can be seen at the Laumeir Sculpture Park in St. Louis through Jan. 4. // Displayed on the shelves lining his gallery are numerous small wonders of Americana . Adorning one of the stark white walls are rows of gorgeously painted cast-iron carriages , each pulled by tiny horses and carrying grand passengers in fashionable array . Among his mechanical banks are ingenious devices designed to encourage saving : In one a penny is put into the hand of a baseball pitcher , who pitches it to a batter , who , in turn , hits it into the globe of the catcher behind him ; in another the coin is given to a confectioner who rewards the saver with a piece of chocolate. // In different corners are wooden whirligigs , among them a primative Uncle Sam whose paddle arms revolve with the wind ; stacks of lithographed picture blocks ; and clockwork , or " wind up , " toys , one featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a velocipede. // Except for one small corner on the gallery ' s second floor , the collection spans the years from 1830 to 1900 . The exception is an assemblage of metal robots and space toys made in Japan between 1950 and 1970 . These , he believes , are the collectible antique toys of the future. // " Virtually any toys , once they stop being made , become collectible , " Mr. Barenholtz says as he pauses to wind a black robot whose top secton splits apart to reveal a hissing , fluorescent red head as it walks . " The toys of the 1930s , especially anything with Mickey Mouse , are now highly sought after . Today ' s plastic toys are destined to go the same route  --  especially since the supply of plastic , which is produced from oil , is limited. " // Although his concentration is on 19th-century toys , he doesn ' t think there is a fundamental difference between antique toys and those made today . " The difference is basically in technology and the materials used . For centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played with rattles . Toys have always introduced children to the world of work and transportation ; the horse-drawn fire engine toys of the 1800s have simply been replaced by the sleek , motorized ones of today. " // But although toys have not changed a great deal , their availability to children has . As outlined in " American Antique Toys , " before the mid-19th century toys were for wealthy children only . While the children of lower-class Americans labored on farms or in factories , the children of the rich had playthings costing as much as $4  --  the equivalent weekly wage of many 19th-century workers. // " If you gave me a group of antique toys from the same period and let me study them , I could probably tell you what like was like in that society , " says Mr. Barenholtz , who enjoys the historical research involved with toy collecting . " For example , the abundance of patriotic toys produced during the centennial  --  those with flags , eagles , Uncle Sams , Mill Liberties  --  says a great deal about the patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if he has a favorite toy , Mr. Barenholtz reluctantly admits to a certain special fondness for Uncle Sam on a velocipede . Like many others in his collection , it was not easy to come by , requiring several years of patient waiting and careful negotiating between the time he located it and the time he owned it. // " American Antique Toys " is full of collecting anecdotes , such as the time Mr. Barenholtz heard a rumor abou the existence of a prize toy collection in a small town in Pennsylvania . After scouting the town to no avail for clues as to who owned the toys , he knocked on the door of the local garbage collector , who , it turned out , had saved a roomful of vintage toys from a sad end at the town dump . From this meeting Mr. Barenholtz acquired a new collector friend and was later able to buy a few of his toys. // Many of the anecdotes reveal that much of the collection was not gathered by purchasing , but by trading . " To serious collectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great toy , " he explains . " There are times when you can ' t buy a toy at any price , but you can acquire it if you can offer another one in its place. " // Since the time Mr. Barenholtz began collecting in the late 1950s , the prices of antique toys have skyrocketed . Some particularly rare items are fetching thousands of dollars. // " I think it is impossible to gauge the value of any toy  --  it can only be determined by what a collector is willing to pay , " he says . " I recently read of a rare German boat that sold for six figures . But that was really just because a certain collector felt it was worth it . Other collectors may not have offered $100. " // Despite such high prices , Mr. Barenholtz does not believe that one must be wealthy to start a collection or that all of the desirable toys have been snapped up by collectors . " I hear all the time about rare toys turning up at flea markets for $10 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more difficult , but there are still some great things out there , undiscovered . That ' s what keeps it exciting. " // What advice would he give to someone who wants to start a collection of antique toys ? " I always tell young people that they must not buy anything until they have seen and studied a great number of toys . That means going to museums , talking to knowledgeable dealers , and reading extensively . Beyond that it ' s a matter of getting a feel for the toys , of finding out what determines quality. // " Then once they are ready to buy , I tell them that they should buy the very best they can afford . An antique dealer once told me that it ' s far better to put $20 in one good piece than the same amount in several inferior or mediocre ones . Quality will always remain quality , while the inferior will always be inferior. " // When determining quality , Mr. Barenholtz says he considers factors such as rarity and condition of the toy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successful collecting involves an intuitive feeling , something that almost makes the toy jump off the shelf and into your hands. " // And that , as is evident from the splendid array encircling his gallery , is more than just child ' s play. // //
