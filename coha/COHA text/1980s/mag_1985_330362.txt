Insofar as he settles anywhere on earth , Korean-born Video Artist Nam June Paik , 53 , lives in Manhattan . More specifically , he inhabits the top of a converted warehouse with a rusting cast-iron facade in SoHo . Entree to Paik 's aerie comes via a freight elevator , with the host himself hauling on the chain pulley that drags the motor into grumbling life . As the aging contraption shakes and shudders toward the fifth floor , Paik says in heavily accented English , " After this , everything anticlimax . " <P> Not quite . Paik 's cavernous loft resembles a Sony factory that was in the process of being ransacked by terrorists when an earthquake struck . Television sets , some dead and most of the others crying out for intensive care , are scattered everywhere , along with packing crates and snaking piles of electronic debris . Paik , a short , roundish man with close-cropped black hair , pads in his slippers through the clutter , happily and completely at home . <P> What does he do here ? He experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several decades ago . Paik was perhaps the first person to perceive the TV screen as a canvas and , ergo , the stream of electrons that creates images on the picture tube as paint . Presto , video art , which means scrambling , bending , rearranging or just generally messing around with the picture on TV sets . As practiced by Paik and his followers , this tinkering can lead to anything from vivid static and colorful snow to whimsical sculptures of the video age . When New York 's Whitney Museum gave Paik 's work a full-scale retrospective in 1982 , viewers encountered strange things . There was a battery of television monitors , showing preprogrammed tapes , set behind a bank of aquariums , in which fish swam randomly . There was a statue of Buddha seated before a closed-circuit TV camera and , below that , a small receiver . Gallerygoers could watch an icon contemplate its own image . If Paik 's art seems serendipitous , so does his journey to the U.S. His periodically prosperous family was driven out of Seoul in 1950 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in Hong Kong and then Tokyo , where Paik earned a university degree with a major in philosophy . At that point , infatuated with the music of Arnold Schoenberg and Western avant-gardism in general , the young graduate might have pursued his studies in the U.S. The country , however , did not interest him . " Many middle-class Koreans go to live in America in the 1950s , " he says . " But I think then there is not much culture in America , Hemingway and all that . " He chose West Germany instead and stayed there eight years . <P> Then he met American Composer John Cage , who was visiting Germany . " He was exotic , " Paik says approvingly . " I hear about Robert Rauschenberg from him , and about other artists doing new things in New York . I think , ' Slowly , slowly , America is coming up . ' " <P> Paik had no intention of speeding this process along when he finally came to the U.S. in 1964 . He merely wanted to visit Cage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far from favorable : " It was as dirty as Paris and as ugly as Dusseldorf . " Yet Paik found himself extending his stay : " I keep saying , ' Half more year , half more year . ' "
